Witness fee\n[1] The Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR) has filed the present complaint alleging a breach of s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The complaint was filed against the person or persons directly responsible for the website www.members\/odinrage.com\/bcwhitepride.com\/immigration.htm, also known as BCWhitePride.com. CRARR claims in the complaint that the website incited discrimination, hate and other violations of the right to equality and dignity of persons because of their race, ethnic or national origin, religion, disability and immigrant status, among others.\nI. PRELIMINARY ISSUES [2] On January 24, 2006, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) referred the complaint to the Tribunal. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the Commission moved to amend the style of cause of the complaint to add as respondent parties John Beck, www.bcwhitepride.org, as well as two groups known respectively as BC White Pride and White Renegade.\n[3] On May 18, 2007, Tribunal Member Pierre Deschamps issued a preliminary ruling on the Commission's motion, allowing John Beck to be added as a party to the proceedings (Center for Research-Action on Race Relations v. www.bcwhitepride.com, 2007 CHRT 20). However, Member Deschamps denied the request to add the White Renegade group as a party. With respect to the BC White Pride group and www.bcwhitepride.org, he ordered that they be served with the ruling so that they could, in due course, make submissions on the Commission's motion to add them as parties. At the opening of the hearing into the complaint, I found that the Commission had not served the ruling on these two potential parties. Consequently, I ruled that the complaint would not be amended to include them.\n[4] As a result, the hearing on the merits of the complaint proceeded solely against www.bcwhitepride.com and John Beck. The Commission was the only party represented by legal counsel at the hearing. CRARR's Executive Director, Fo Niemi, appeared on behalf of the Complainant. Mr. Beck was present at the hearing assisted by Paul Fromm, who is not a lawyer. Mr. Fromm acted as Mr. Beck's agent. He made an opening statement, posed questions to witnesses, and led final arguments on behalf of Mr. Beck. No one appeared on behalf of www.bcwhitepride.com.\nII. DECISION [5] For the reasons set out below, I have determined that the complaint regarding Mr. Beck is substantiated. With respect to www.whitepride.com, however, I have concluded that this is merely the Internet address of a website and not a person or group of persons within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act. Consequently, the complaint as against www.whitepride.com has not been substantiated.\nIII. SECTION 13 OF THE ACT [6] In order for a complaint under s. 13(1) to be substantiated, it must be established that matter:\nthat is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, was communicated telephonically or caused to be so communicated, repeatedly, in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, by a person or group of persons acting in concert.\n[7] Prohibited grounds of discrimination include race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, and disability (s. 3).\nIV. WHAT ARE THE IMPUGNED MESSAGES IN THIS CASE? [8] Mr. Niemi testified that CRARR is an independent, non-profit organization based in Montreal, having as its mandate the promotion of racial harmony and equality within Canadian society. Its activities include conducting research, organizing conferences and seminars, and providing training regarding diversity management or dealing with discrimination. CRARR also provides individual assistance and representation to persons who believe they have been discriminated against because of their race, religion, ethnicity or other related grounds.\n[9] CRARR regularly receives correspondence from members of the public bringing to its attention matters of interest. In May 2003, an email was sent to CRARR suggesting that it look into a website called bcwhitepride.com. Mr. Niemi and his colleagues at CRARR viewed the site and came to the opinion that it violated s. 13 of the Act. They therefore took steps to advise the Commission of the website's existence and file the present human rights complaint.\n[10] Mr. Niemi testified that at the time when the complaint was filed (March 23, 2004), the material was viewed on a website the home page of which had a rather complex address: http:\/\/members.odinrage.com\/bcwhitepride. Mr. Niemi referred to this website as bcwhitepride.com. By September 2004, several months after the complaint had been filed, the material that was found at this web address had been transferred to a website located at http:\/\/www.bcwhitepride.org. The text from the pages that Mr. Niemi had viewed on the original site had been carried forward unchanged to the new site, but a few slight modifications had been made to the appearance of the pages (such as text fonts and table formatting). The Commission and CRARR contend that the .com website was merely transformed to the .org website and that Mr. Beck communicated the impugned messages through the use initially of the bcwhitepride.com website and subsequently via bcwhitepride.org.\n[11] The website (at both Internet addresses) had a home page with a greeting welcoming visitors to the site. It set out some of the themes that were addressed within the site's other pages, by stating the following (all the excerpts from the website that I have included in this decision are reproduced without any corrections to typographical, grammatical and other errors):\nWelcome to BC White Pride!\nThere's a bold new movement being championed in British Columbia focused specifically on educating White people regarding issues of concern such as immigration, media control, demographics, higher education and cultural degradation. The proud men and women of BC White Pride have made an informed and deliberate decision to join together to combat the premeditated decline of our people.\nWe are men and women of European descent that stand for the preservation of our race, heritage and culture for future generations. We are deeply concerned with the current trend of immigration from non-White countries into both Canada and our beloved European homelands.\nWe aim to expose the obvious monopoly of our media by the Jews who foment an agenda of liberalism, political correctness, multicultism and race mixing culminating in the breakdown of morality and family values in our proud culture. Moreover, we are frustrated with governmental policies that no longer serve the best interests of White people, the erstwhile founders of this great nation and so many others around the world.\nWe hope to educate you to the facts that the Jewsmedia is not telling you, and to request assistance from you to help secure the existence of our people and a future for White children.\nThis opening text was then followed up by the following passage:\nDid you know?\nPeople of unmixed European descent now consist of only 8% of the world's population!\nOnly 2% of the world's population are white females within child bearing age or younger!\nAbortion rates and the elevated use of birth control among Whites combined with the fact that less White families are having children has put the white birthrate below replacement levels worldwide!\nMiscegenation (race-mixing) is at all time high in all White cultures and is being aggressively promoted by the Jewsmedia like there's no tomorrow, literally!\nThird world immigration, if left unchecked, will render North America, Europe and Australia with a non-White majority by the turn of the next century!\nListen to the call of your once proud people! Help us make the country a better place for White families...\n[12] On the left side of the page was a column listing a number of topics, which are in fact links to the other pages of the website. By clicking on the topic, the related page opened for the reader. The column remained visible on each of the website's pages, enabling the visitor to access the other pages by clicking on the link at any time, without having to return to the home page. The column contained the following links:\nImmigration\nThe Media\nThe Jews\nCanadian Politics\nThe Struggle at a Glance\nRacial Health\nSolutions\n(i) The Immigration link [13] The Immigration link brought the reader to a page containing a commentary entitled Canada's Failed Immigration Policy. The main premise of the commentary is that while Canada's immigration policy traditionally favoured hard-working people of European stock, the 1960's saw the rise of a tumultuous generation hellbent on undermining the traditional values of Canada.\n[14] The text relies upon figures released by Statistics Canada to support its conclusions. For instance, it is put forward that Canadian immigration policy now favours Asians over immigrants from all places of birth combined, based on the Statistics Canada figure that the origin of 53.2% of all persons immigrating to Canada in 2000 was identified as Asia and Pacific. The commentary goes on to posit that the reason for this calamity is that family class immigrants constitute 60% of all immigrants, arguing that Asians are displacing the founding race of this country at an alarming pace, specifically when we allow them to bring in family members from Third World nations. On the other hand, highly qualified European workers are forced to proceed through the rigours of the points system, which assesses official language proficiency and compares an applicant's occupational history with the list of underrepresented occupations in Canada.\n[15] Elsewhere in the commentary, figures are cited, which purportedly demonstrate that almost 22% of immigrants to British Columbia between 1961 and 1996 came from either the People's Republic of China, Taiwan or Hong Kong. This statistic prompts the text's author to state, Perhaps it's time to rename the province Chinese Columbia. The article then goes on to recount the efforts made in British Columbia at the start of the 20th century to prevent the entry of Asian immigrants. The article includes the following lyrics to a song that was supposedly sung in 1907 by opponents to the entry of Asians:\nThen let us stand united and tall, and show our fathers might that won the home we call our own, for the white man's land we fight! To the Oriental grasp and greed we'll never surrender, no never! White Canada forever!\nThe article follows this excerpt with the comment, If only we possessed the collective courage of our founding forefathers.\n[16] The article concludes with the assertion that the premeditated extinction of Europeans in our great land is under way and that the immigrants who have come to Canada will continue to reap the fruits of our labour until our people are rendered a minority in our own land. The final sentence on this web page states, We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children!\n(ii) The Media link [17] Mr. Niemi testified that when he initially visited the bcwhitepride.com website in 2003, clicking on this link did not result in his being redirected to another webpage. However, when he visited the website after its content had been moved to the new address (bcwhitepride.org), he was redirected to a page entitled Media Control in North America when he clicked on the Media link.\n[18] The article on this web page asserts that the television, filmmaking and other mass media industries in North America, are in reality [...] absolutely dominated by one group of people that clearly have an agenda that is not representative of the best interests of the majority White population. The commentary goes on to explain that these all-powerful masters of the media are Jews to a very large extent, and that the preponderance of the Jews in the media is so overwhelming that we are obliged to assume that it is due to more than mere happenstance.\n[19] The article then proceeds to set out the media outlets owned by the Asper family in Canada as well as to provide a list setting out the names of dozens of Jewish US Media Moguls. It takes the view that Jewish media control determines the foreign policy of the United States and permits Jewish interests rather than American interests to decide questions of war and peace. The article concludes as follows:\nIt would be intolerable for such power to be in the hands of any alien minority, with values and interests different from our own, but to permit the Jews, who have historically held us with such contempt, to hold such power over us is tantamount to race suicide. Indeed, the fact so many White People today are so filled with a sense of racial guilt and self-hatred that they actively seek the death of their own race is a deliberate consequence of Jewish media control. Once we have absorbed and understood the fact of Jewish media control, it is our inescapable responsibility to do whatever is necessary to break that control. We must shrink from nothing in our quest to overthrow this insipid power that we have subconsciously allowed to enslave our minds. If we fail to destroy this loathsome beast, it will erode at the very foundations of our race and destroy us from within.\n(iii) The Jews link [20] As in the case of the Media page, Mr. Niemi was unable to view this web page in 2003, but when the website moved to the bcwhitepride.org internet address, the link became functional. The internet address of the actual page that Mr. Niemi was redirected to when he clicked on The Jews was http:\/\/bcwhitepride.org\/juden.htm. The title of the article found thereon was A Brief History of the Jews.\n[21] The text challenges the general consensus of the public that centuries of persecution directed against the Jews should earn them `victim' status, and proposes that to really understand why the Jews have been persecuted, we must briefly look at their history in a nutshell. The article then proceeds to document in detail statements made and actions taken regarding Jews, throughout history. There is discussion in the article of the role Jews have played with regard to the `art' of usury, the foundation of communism, and in the establishment of international financial control run by ultrawealthy Jewish families that bought out Gentile companies and banks through legal, if unethical practices.\n[22] In its conclusions, the article expresses concern about how Jews are employing their vast power and their unchallenged control of almost every walk of life. It is stated that white nations are being manipulated and controlled by the Jews, and that it is in the Jews' best interest to protect themselves from those that understand their role in history and contemporary society by introducing the notion of White guilt for their persecution, through the controlled media and educational institutions. In the end, it is argued, it comes down to the destruction of White identity and nationalism.\n(iv) The Canadian Politics link [23] This web page consists of a commentary regarding the Liberal Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance\/Reform Party. The article described the Liberal Party's bending over backward to pander to racial minorities at the expense of the White majority as a disturbing trend, which was reflected in the appointment of Adrienne Clarkson (an immigrant from Hong Kong) as Governor General. Her husband, John Ralston Saul, is referred to as a race traitor. Prime Minister Jean Chretien is criticized for having appointed Rey Pagtakhan (a recent Filipino immigrant) and Hedy Fry (a non-white immigrant from Trinidad) as ministers. Efforts by the Liberal government of the time to stiffen sentences on hate crimes, launch national youth programs to fight racism and establish a national strategy to fight hate and bias activities, are criticized as constituting a Liberal campaign to undermine White society.\n[24] The efforts by the Canadian Alliance Party to become more politically inclusive are also criticized. The party is accused of having been infiltrated by multicultists at the upper echelon. It is highlighted that the son of the party's former leader, Stockwell Day, married a Filipino woman. Mr. Day is criticized for having even used his multiracial grandchildren in his campaign advertisements. The article concludes that the Alliance Party's liberal stances on many issues have attracted many South Asian, East Asian and Jewish representatives. Consequently, race conscious White Canadian voters have no real alternatives at the voting booth, and they must therefore take a revolutionary third position and look beyond the conventional political system to solve their problems.\n(v) The Struggle at a Glance link [25] This web page purports to contain a list with short descriptions of the largest and most influential factions that have emerged since the ideological overthrow of traditional racialist organizations like the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). The article explains that these factions began after the golden age of the Ku Klux Klan. The reader is put on notice that the men and women of BC White Pride have elected not to affiliate with any groups listed and that these groups do not necessarily represent the interests or objectives of BC White Pride.\n[26] The list includes references to websites operated by these groups, referring to one such site as useful...for newcomers to the movement who wish to network and who seek education relating to prominent Canadians involved in the racialist struggle. Another of these websites is described as a great electronic meeting place for race conscious White people from all corners of the globe.\n(vi) The Racial Health link [27] The objective of this web page, according to its introductory paragraph, is to outline important issues relating to the tragic demise of White racial health on a global scale. The article is divided into three segments entitled respectively IQ and Race, Abortion and Race, and Euthanasia and Race.\n[28] The first section, IQ and Race, argues that many social evils, such as chronic unemployment, long term welfare dependency, crime, single motherhood, and poverty, would be reduced if the intelligence of the population could be increased. This is unlikely to occur, it is claimed, because the genetic component of intelligence is allegedly deteriorating through a process called dysgenisis, which results from the tendency of the most intelligent classes to have fewer children and through the large scale immigration of those with low intelligence.\n[29] This process is said to be accelerated in multiethnic societies, where certain minority groups with a lower level of intelligence have higher fertility rates than Whites. Blacks, it is asserted, have a significantly lower level of intelligence than Whites and Asians and this contributes to the over-representation of Blacks with respect to the social pathologies of poor educational attainment, single motherhood, crime, etc. Thus, concludes this section of the article, as the cognitive underclass continues to outbreed the intellectual elite in White nations across the globe, the average IQ of White societies will continue to fall. This will precipitate the decline of the great civilizations that our ancestors fought so hard to build. Only a society that aggressively controls immigration and encourages the adoption of fertility policies conducive to the improvement of its genetic stock can reverse dysgenis.\n[30] The Abortion and Race section of the article takes issue with policies that allow abortion on demand. It holds out that, more often than not, it is a potentially healthy, productive White baby that is aborted. As a result, the text goes on to say, abortion on demand is counterproductive in White nations specifically because our birth rate has fallen below replacement levels. Thus, White nations are unable to maintain a stable population base.\n[31] The article does not, however, argue for the prohibition of abortion in all cases. The criteria for aborting a foetus should depend primarily on considerations relating to the potential net gain or profit that the resulting individual will have on our society as a whole. It suggests that abortion be available with respect to non-White foetuses, given the well-documented differential IQ levels between races and that, on the whole, non-White foetuses have a negative aggregate genetic impact on our society. The article also supports abortion in situations where the foetus is deformed and will be born with a severe mental and\/or physical disability.\n[32] This leads to the thesis of the article's third segment, Euthanasia and Race, which asserts that severely retarded and brain damaged do not qualify as net contributors to society, but [are] a tragic drain on their families and society as a whole. Advocates for the disabled are criticized for equating rights of even the most severely retarded person with those of the cognitive elite. Such disabled persons should be euthanized, it is argued, and this in turn will have an impact on the racial issue because white couples who are enslaved by severely disabled children are less likely to have more white children. The article condemns the fact that contemporary abortion laws allow the premeditated murder [of] a potentially healthy productive White foetus, while it is illegal and punishable by life sentence to kill a severely retarded or brain damaged person who needs constant care at taxpayers' expense for the duration of their pointless lives. In addition, the article posits that if the funds currently misappropriated to care for the severely disabled were spent providing tax breaks to large families, White people would be encouraged to have more, healthy children. In making its points on this issue, the article refers to the severely disabled as parasites, incognizant primates, and genetic throwbacks.\n[33] In short, the article concludes, policies aimed at reducing the natural inequalities between individuals and peoples are not only counterproductive, but wasteful considering the bell curve of attributes naturally occurring in any biological population. Equality, it is argued, is a myth propounded by those who would seek to dissuade us from our instinctual prerogative to cull the lesser beasts from the herd.\n(vii) The Solutions link [34] This article purports to offer some answers to readers who may be wondering what they can do to help their struggling race. One of the suggestions is to cease relying on television and the print media for information. Instead, doing one's own research on the Internet is recommended. It is claimed that more truth can be found through an independent investigation on the worldwide web than on television or in your daily Jewspaper.\n[35] Another proposed solution is to spread our message of hope and assist us in re-educating Whites who have succumbed to the ideologies propageated by the controlled media. This can be achieved, it is suggested, by approaching friends whose frame of mind might be compatible with the objectives of our cause. The reader is also encouraged to print out several flyers, which were available and could be viewed on the website, for legal distribution in libraries, educational institutions and parking lots.\n[36] The Commission entered into evidence two of these flyers. The first is in the form of a missing person bulletin. It contains a photo of a young, white girl. The caption accompanying the photo states the following:\nMISSING\nA Future For White Children!\nDescription: Blonde, red or brown hair, fair skin, innocent, inquisitive, intelligent, trusting personality. Ultraliberal politicians and minority special interest groups have abducted her future. There will be no future for her in the Multicultural Canada that our government has planned. Lets take back our country and make it great, clean, decent and beautiful again for our children's sake. The Men and Women of BC White Pride want you to join in this great and patriotic effort.\nJoin BC White Pride Today!\nHelp us make this country a better place for White families.\nwww.bcwhitepride.com\n[37] The second flyer contains a photo of a white mother with three white children. The title at the top of the page states BC WHITE PRIDE. A caption around the photo reads, We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. At the bottom of the flyer, appears the following text:\nDon't you think our heritage and way of life are worth preserving?\nJoin BC White Pride Today!\nHelp us make this country a better place for White families\nwww.bcwhitepride.com\n[38] In the left and right margins of the flyer, one can view eight short messages. Only a portion of these messages is visible on the printout that was entered into evidence. One of the messages appears to say, White birthrates are well below replacement level, while non-white birthrates are at an all time high. Another states, At the turn of the next century, most White countries will have a White minority, while another says, Our media is virtually controlled by a small group of people that do not have the best interests of the White population in mind.\nV. ANALYSIS A. Is the material likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that the person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, within the meaning of s. 13(1)? [39] In Nealy v. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal found that the term hatred involves feelings of extreme ill will towards another person or group of persons. To say that one hates another means that one finds no redeeming qualities in the latter. The Tribunal added that contempt suggests looking down upon or treating as inferior the objects of one's feelings. The two terms are not necessarily co-extensive. In some instances, hatred may be the result of envy of superior qualities such as intelligence, wealth and power, which contempt, by definition, cannot be.\n[40] The Nealy Tribunal went on to say that the use of the word likely in s. 13(1) means that it is not necessary to prove that the effect of the communication will be that those who hear the messages will direct hatred or contempt against others. Nor is it necessary to show that, in fact, anyone was so victimized.\n[41] These findings were later endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.C. 892. The Court added that the terms hatred or contempt in s. 13(1) refer to unusually strong and deep-felt emotions of detestation, calumny and vilification.\n[42] I find that the articles posted on the bcwhitepride.com and bcwhitepride.org websites contain matter that is likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt, within the meaning of s. 13(1), as interpreted in the jurisprudence.\n[43] The material purports to represent the views of those who are championing the cause of the proud men and women who have come together to combat the premeditated decline of people of European descent. But in advancing these views, non-Whites and the disabled are treated as persons whose value and contributions to society is less than white peoples'. Jews, meanwhile, are represented as a powerful menace to society, responsible for many of its evils. In short, anyone other than the we whose interests the website purports to defend is treated with extreme hatred or contempt.\n(i) How does the material expose non-white persons to hatred or contempt? [44] As the Commission persuasively argued at the hearing, the comments that expose non-Whites to hatred or contempt within the material were both specific and generalized. It is specifically asserted in the Racial Health article that Blacks have a significantly lower level of intelligence than Whites or Asians and that this contributes to the over-representation of Blacks with respect to social pathologies of poor educational attainment, single motherhood, crime, etc. Blacks are referred to as the cognitive underclass. These statements look down upon Blacks and treat them as inferior. Furthermore, the comments link Blacks' supposed lack of intelligence with social pathologies like crime. As the Tribunal in Warman v. Kouba, 2006 CHRT 50 (Kouba), noted at paragraphs 45-6, blaming current societal problems on a targeted group is a hallmark of hate messages.\n[45] In a more general way, Whites are presented as superior to, and more valuable than, other races. Thus, abortion of white foetuses is viewed as undesirable whereas it is acceptable with respect to others. Non-white foetuses are said to have a negative aggregate genetic impact on our society and therefore efforts should be made to encourage their abortion. This assessment strongly suggests that the lives of black persons are essentially valueless and thereby treats them with extreme contempt.\n[46] This matter of the inferiority of non-Whites is reiterated in the material's repeated references to immigration in Canada. Non-Whites are portrayed as undesirables whose entry into the country is a calamity that must be restricted. The Immigration article reminisces fondly back to an era in Canada when Asian immigrants were treated as second-class and when there were calls to fight for the white man's land to free it from the Oriental grasp and greed. This theme of a racial fight or war against the onslaught of non-Whites is reinforced with allusions to white people being under siege, fearful for the extinction of Europeans. Those who encourage the progress of non-white immigrants within Canadian society are criticized. Those who associate closely with non-white immigrants are vilified and called race traitors. Statements calling for the once proud people to rise up and, as the flyer entitled Missing asserts, take back our country, resemble a call to arms. As the Tribunal in Kouba, supra, noted, at paragraphs 76-7, appeals for violent action to be taken against a targeted group is another hallmark of hate messages.\n[47] The message in the Missing flyer is that a society that is accepting of multiculturalism ceases to be great, clean, decent and beautiful, and becomes a society in which the future of white children is threatened. This preoccupation with the future of white children reinforces the notion that the presence of non-Whites puts the well-being of white children in jeopardy. The suggestion being conveyed is that Whites should develop deep-felt emotions of detestation to those who will supposedly undermine and attack the well-being of white Children, i.e. non-Whites. The portrayal of a targeted group as preying upon children or other vulnerable persons has been identified in s. 13 related jurisprudence as another telltale sign of hate messages (see Kouba, supra at paras. 40-1).\n(ii) How does the material expose Jews to hatred or contempt? [48] The Tribunal in Kouba, supra, at paras. 24-5, pointed out that one of the hallmarks of hate messages, as developed in the growing body of s. 13 jurisprudence, is the portrayal of a targeted group as a powerful menace that is taking control of society's major institutions and depriving others of their livelihoods, safety, freedom of speech and general well-being. This is precisely the way that Jews are presented throughout the website.\n[49] The Jews article, for instance, argues that Jews use their vast power and their unchallenged control of almost every walk of life to manipulate and control White nations, as a result of which White identity and nationalism is being destroyed. There are numerous references to the purported Jewish control of mass media throughout the material, including the use of fabricated words like Jewsmedia and Jewspaper. To permit Jews to hold such power over us, states the Media article, is tantamount to race suicide. Jews are thus portrayed as a real and dangerous threat to Whites. What is particularly disconcerting is that the material appears to call for concrete, or even violent action, to overthrow this insipid power and destroy this loathsome beast, which is eroding at the very foundations of our race and will destroy us from within.\n[50] These statements clearly impart unusually strong emotions of detestation and vilification towards Jews. They create conditions in which hatred and contempt toward Jewish people can flourish by encouraging the public to resent Jews for being manipulative and menacing to the interests of others, and generally for failing to possess any redeeming qualities (see Smith v. Western Guard Party, 1979 CanLII 1 (C.H.R.T.); Citron v. Zundel (2002), 41 CHRR D\/27 at paras. 139-40).\n[51] One also finds in the impugned material the use of ostensibly true stories and facts, such as those allegedly linking Jews with the development of objectionable activities like usury and communism, in order to make negative generalizations, a practice which has been found likely to expose members of the targeted group to hatred or contempt (see Kouba, supra, at paras. 30-2).\n[52] In addition, contempt towards Jews is demonstrated in the dehumanizing manner with which their persecution is portrayed. Jews are presented as having brought anti-Semitism upon themselves. The victims are effectively blamed for the discrimination that they have experienced and in so doing, the effect of the discrimination is downplayed. It has been held that the trivialization of past persecution or tragedy creates a climate of derision and contempt that is likely to expose members of the targeted group to these emotions (see Kouba, supra, at paras. 72-5).\n(iii) How does the material expose the disabled to hatred or contempt? [53] The material found in the Euthanasia and Race article unquestionably exposes disabled people to hatred or contempt. To begin with, people with severe mental or physical disabilities are treated with extreme contempt through the use of highly inflammatory and derogatory language, which portrays them as greatly inferior to the cognitive elite (see Kouba, supra, at para. 67). They are branded as parasites, incognizant primates, genetic throwbacks, genetically inferior, and lesser beasts that must be culled from the herd.\n[54] The article takes the position that the severely disabled and brain damaged are not net contributors to society, but rather a tragic drain on their families and societies. Criticism is laid on abortion laws that allow for healthy productive White foetuses to be aborted while it remains a crime to kill a severely retarded or brain damaged person that needs constant care for the duration of his or her pointless life. The obvious message underlying these remarks is that disabled persons are less worthy than able White persons and are therefore not entitled to the same basic rights, including the right to live. The disabled, by their very existence, are presented as harming the rest of society, a parasitic drain. It is hard to imagine any comments being more likely to expose disabled persons to hatred or contempt.\n(iv) Conclusion: The material is likely to expose the targeted groups to hatred or contempt [55] In sum, therefore, I find that there is matter found on the bcwhitepride.com and bcwhitepride.org websites that is likely to expose persons identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination (namely race, colour, religion, national or ethnic origin and disability) to hatred or contempt.\nB. Were the communications made repeatedly, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act? [56] The Tribunal has held in the past that material communicated via the Internet is by that medium's innate characteristics alone, a repeated communication, particularly where no obstacles are put in place that would prevent anyone connected to the Internet from surfing his or her way to a website and viewing the material (see Warman v. Beaumont, 2007 CHRT 49 at paras. 51-7; Warman v. Harrison 2006 CHRT 30 at para. 44; Warman v. Kulbashian, 2006 CHRT 11 at para. 62; Warman v. Tremaine, 2007 CHRT 2 at paras. 116-9). Mr. Niemi testified that he was able to view the material just by typing in the Internet addresses of the websites. Clicking on the links found on the website enabled him to view the various articles comprising the impugned material.\n[57] I therefore find that the material was communicated repeatedly.\nC. Who communicated the impugned messages? (i) Did John Beck communicate the impugned messages? [58] Websites are identified by domain names (eg. bcwhitepride.org) that are registered with a domain name registration service (see Kulbashian, supra at para. 66). Information regarding the identity of these registrants is publicly available on the Internet through websites like whois.net. The registrant for bcwhitepride.com, as of August 2004, was NOLDC Inc., with an address in New Orleans, Louisiana. No name of an individual appears in the information provided. With respect to bcwhitepride.org, its registrant as of May 2005 was Domains by Proxy Inc. with an address in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n[59] Evidence was introduced regarding whois searches, during the hearing on the preliminary motion. The parties asked me to review the transcripts from this hearing and take the evidence led into consideration during my deliberations on the merits of the complaint. There was testimony at the preliminary hearing regarding the ease with which a registrant may submit false information with respect to names and addresses when registering a website.\n[60] Accordingly, the Commission contends that the registration information regarding bcwhitepride.com and bcwhitepride.org is misleading and that Mr. Beck is in fact the person who actually communicated the impugned messages via the Internet, on those websites. In order to establish this link between Mr. Beck and the messages, the Commission produced a series of emails that were exchanged in March 2004, between an individual named Shane Martinez and someone who was using renegade1488ca@yahoo.com as an email address. Mr. Martinez was called by the Commission as a witness at the hearing. He testified that he has been involved in the study of human rights and in social justice activism for over a decade. His work has included research into the activities of white supremacist movements on the Internet.\n[61] Mr. Martinez stated that in early 2004, he discovered a website called whiterenegade.com during the course of his research. He wanted to learn the identity of the person(s) responsible for this website, so he sent an email to the site's contact email address, pretending to be a female person named Rachel, who was claiming to be curious about the site's content. Mr. Martinez received a reply email from someone with the email address renegade1488ca@yahoo.com, who explained that John was his real name. John's email exchanges with Rachel (i.e. Mr. Martinez) were later followed up by a series of instant messaging (or chat line) discussions between the two persons. In one of the email exchanges, John wrote that he regularly posted messages under the pseudonym (or username) of Renegade, on a message board operated by a website called stormfront.org.\n[62] At the opening of the hearing into the merits of the complaint, Mr. Fromm, speaking on behalf of Mr. Beck, admitted that Mr. Beck was indeed the person who had communicated with Mr. Martinez in these email and chat line exchanges, using the renegade1488ca@yahoo.com email address. Mr. Beck also acknowledged that Mr. Martinez's printouts of the email and chat line exchanges were genuine and had not been tampered with. These admissions are consistent with Member Deschamps's findings in his preliminary ruling in this case. Mr. Beck did not admit, however, that the statements made by him in these exchanges were actually true.\n[63] The Commission contends that based on Mr. Beck's contributions to these email and chat line discussions, it is evident that he was the author and communicator of the impugned messages in this case. For instance, during an email exchange on March 8, 2004, Mr. Martinez praised the work done on the whiterenegade.com website and wondered if whiterenegade was also the name of a group. Mr. Beck replied:\nThis site whiterenegade.com is my own personal online manifesto. It is not a group. However I did co-found a group called BC White Pride. I helped write much of the content on the site at www.bcwhitepride.com.\n[emphasis added].\n[64] Mr. Fromm argued that little should be made of this assertion by Mr. Beck. To begin with, it is unclear what much of the content means. Was Mr. Beck the author of the material, and if so, of what portion? By claiming that he helped write the content, did Mr. Beck mean that he perfected or cleaned up the text as an editor, or perhaps that he provided the writer with research material? Mr. Beck, however, did not testify and did not lead any evidence to explain how limited his involvement may have been.\n[65] On the contrary, the Commission claims that circumstantial evidence establishes that Mr. Beck was the author of the material. The Commission identified a number of fairly striking similarities and common themes between the impugned messages on the one hand and, on the other hand, Mr. Beck's email and chat line statements along with his postings on the stormfront.org message board. The Commission submits that this additional evidence renders it more likely than not that Mr. Beck wrote and communicated the impugned messages. These alleged similarities include the following:\nIn the exchanges with Mr. Martinez, Mr. Beck uses a number of uncommon terms, which also appear in the impugned messages, including the following examples:\n\u00b0 In one chat line exchange, Mr. Beck explains that he is upset with his church for allowing an Aboriginal mother and her children, whose father is white, to attend services. Mr. Beck considers the situation to be dangerous claiming that her presence within the church fosters an attitude of fanatical tolerance. The identical term is used in the impugned messages, under the Racial Health link, in the section devoted to euthanasia, where it is stated:\nMore to the point, advocates of disabled rights are well aware of the psychological impact of conditioning people to accept and subsidize their genetically inferior counterparts and integrate them into society. [...] The mindset propagated by these pathological liberals encourages a philosophy of fanatical tolerance.\n[emphasis added]\n\u00b0 In the Canadian Politics portion of the impugned material, former Governor-General Adrienne Clarkson is described as an immigrant from Hong Kong who married race traitor John Ralston Saul. Similarly, in the email exchanges with Mr. Martinez, Mr. Beck wrote, If a White man marries a hook nosed Jewess and converts to Judaism, he a race traitor [sic]. The same term was used in a 2007 posting on stormfront.org by Renegade, in which white persons seeking to adopt trans racially are called would be race traitors. As I indicated earlier, Mr. Beck had declared to Mr. Martinez that he was posting messages on the stormfront.org message board, under the pseudonym Renegade.\nThe concern expressed in the Racial Health section of the impugned messages regarding the genetic superiority of certain classes and the deterioration of their genetic stock is a theme that is also taken up by Mr. Beck in his email messages to Mr. Martinez. Thus, Mr. Beck wrote in one exchange:\nWe can show the non-white races a little respect by staying away from their women, no matter how attractive the ODD ONE may be. This helps out our race by not introducing alien genetics to out [sic] gene pool, as well as being a good will gesture towards them.\nSimilarly, Mr. Beck wrote under the Renegade user name, in a 2007 posting on stormfront.org, that he disapproved of non-Whites marrying white persons to improve their genetic stock, conduct which he described as an exploitation of the white race for their own benefit.\nThe material found on the Solutions link of the impugned messages focussed on the future of our white children. Flyers could be downloaded containing photos of white children and the message that ultraliberals and minority special interest groups have abducted her future. Mr. Beck, in his chat line discussions with Mr. Martinez, demonstrates that he too has a particular interest in caring for the future of white children. Mr. Beck points out that his pastor has four perfect white teenage children and that he (Mr. Beck) has been a mentor to these white youth in the church. He claims to have subtly given them racial understanding and guidance by showing a lot of affection to white children but no attention to the mongrel children of the Aboriginal mother. Mr. Beck expresses hope that the impressionable white teenagers have seen this favouritism and that they follow his example.\nIn the Racial Health section of the impugned messages, it is argued that the severely retarded and brain damaged should be euthanized. Similarly, Mr. Beck wrote in a posting on the stormfront.org message board under the user name Renegade that he supports the idea of mandatory euthanasia in cases where a healthy, productive, vibrant human being is transformed into a severely handicapped vegetable.\n[66] The Commission submits that further identification of Mr. Beck as the author and communicator of the impugned messages can be imputed from the content of the whiterenegade.com website. As I explained earlier, Mr. Beck boasted that the whiterenegade.com was his own personal online manifesto. The Commission claims that the website contains material some of which is almost identical to that of the impugned messages. For instance:\nIn whiterenegade.com, an article dealing with abortion and the problem with pro-choice states:\nStudy after study shows that 90% of abortions are performed for what amount to reasons of convenience. We find this repugnant because, more often than not, it is a potentially healthy, productive white baby that is being aborted. The waiting list for adopting a healthy White baby is about seven years. This is far too long a wait. This waiting time could be cut dramatically if there were more restrictions put on abortions.\nThe almost identical text appears in the impugned messages found on bcwhitepride.com, in the Racial Health article under the Abortion and Race section. I have underlined the portions of the text that are identical to those found in whiterenegade.com:\nStudy after study shows that most abortions are performed for what amount to reasons of convenience. More often than not it is a potentially, healthy, productive White baby that is aborted. Conversely, the waiting list for adopting a healthy White baby is seven years. This waiting time could be cut dramatically if there were more restrictions put on abortions.\nElsewhere in whiterenegade.com, it is argued that there is a link between racial issues and the views expressed on the website, regarding euthanasia:\nHow does this all tie into race? White couples that are enslaved to severely disabled child will be less likely to have more White children.\nThe almost identical text (see underlined portions) appears in the impugned messages found on bcwhitepride.com:\nHow does this alllayout-grid-mode:both; font-weight:normal\"> relate to the racial issue? Specifically, White couples enslaved by severely disabled children will be less likely to have more White children.\n[67] These are just some examples. There are other instances where I find that virtually identical language has been used on both websites. Furthermore, there are common themes to the messages communicated on both websites. In a section called Love and Hate on whiterenegade.com, a list of examples of love from a pro-White perspective includes the love of precious White children, which is consistent with the fondness for white children demonstrated on bcwhitepride.com and bcwhitepride.org. Whiterenegade.com's list of hated things includes the fact that Jews have taken control over our news media, entertainment industry, government, and education system and that this control is used to undermine and destroy the White race. Yet another hated fact is the desecration of human life by taking brain injury victims and hooking them up to life support, thereby transforming a healthy, vibrant human being into a severely disabled vegetable. These are themes that are also found in the impugned messages of bcwhitepride.com and bcwhitepride.org.\n[68] The Commission also points out that throughout the email and chat line exchanges, Mr. Beck refers to himself as part of a group called BC White Pride, alluding to those of us at bcwp and my friend at bcwp. He describes himself as a co-founder of the group a number of times.\n[69] In my view, the inference can in fact be drawn from Mr. Beck's admission to writing much of the content on bcwhitepride.com as well as from the above mentioned links to and similarities with Mr. Beck's other material, that he was the author and the person who communicated or caused to be communicated the impugned messages. Given my earlier finding that the impugned messages contain matter that constitutes hate messages within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act, this inference, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from Mr. Beck (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at 558 (O'Malley). It is incumbent upon Mr. Beck to provide a reasonable explanation demonstrating that the discrimination did not occur as alleged (for instance, that it was not he who engaged in the discriminatory practice), or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory.\n[70] As I stated earlier, Mr. Beck opted not to testify at the hearing and he called no witnesses. There is no evidence before me of Mr. Beck denying that he posted the impugned messages or that he was not their author, nor is there any evidence specifying what possible lesser role Mr. Beck may have played in helping write the material, as Mr. Fromm suggested in his submissions. The latter argument would, in any event, constitute a doubtful explanation, given that even a group of persons acting in concert may be found in breach of s. 13 for having communicated or caused to be communicated a hate message.\n[71] Mr. Fromm also argued that the views expressed on the whiterenegade.com site are in some way milder than the bcwhitepride.com material and would not constitute material that offends s. 13. From this, he contends, I should infer that Mr. Beck was not the author of the impugned material that is found on the bcwhitepride.com website. I reject this argument. To begin with, the question of whether the whiterenegade.com material violates s. 13 is not a matter that is before me in this case. More significantly, I see no foundation for drawing the inference that merely because a second text contains only portions of the first one, then necessarily someone else must have written the remaining portions of that first text. This is mere conjecture. There is simply no evidence to support this assertion.\n[72] In addition, Mr. Fromm contends that Mr. Martinez's evidence was gathered in an unethical manner and that it is objectionable for the Commission to be relying on material derived from such a sordid investigation. Mr. Fromm took particular issue with the fact that Mr. Martinez assumed a false persona and that he sent Mr. Beck several images of a woman that he had downloaded from the Internet without that woman's consent. Mr. Martinez sent these photos to Mr. Beck as purportedly true pictures of the fictional Rachel in order to be more convincing in the female persona that he had adopted in his exchanges.\n[73] I fail to see how the methods used by Mr. Martinez serve as an answer or reasonable explanation to the prima facie case that has been made against Mr. Beck. Whatever Mr. Martinez's methods may have been, the fact remains that it was Mr. Beck who wrote the messages in these email and chat line exchanges, utilizing the email address renegade1488ca@yahoo.com, and who declared having posted messages on stormfront.org, under the name Renegade.\n[74] Mr. Fromm also claims that Mr. Martinez is an unreliable witness, given his activities within anti-racist movements and his participation in demonstrations against certain individuals, including Mr. Fromm. However, the question of Mr. Martinez's credibility with respect to his evidence regarding the content of his email and chat line exchanges was already addressed in the preliminary ruling in this case. The Tribunal determined that the email and chat line transcripts had not been tampered with and that they were truthful and trustworthy, a fact that Mr. Fromm, speaking for Mr. Beck, also admitted at the hearing. Given that the authenticity of the documents has been conceded, Mr. Martinez's credibility is essentially immaterial.\n[75] I agree with Mr. Fromm that many of Mr. Beck's messages in these exchanges demonstrate that he genuinely believed he was conversing with a young woman who appeared to be interested in developing a personal relationship with him. Mr. Fromm argues that Mr. Beck may have embellished his comments as a result, particularly in his description of himself and his activities, just so he could impress Rachel. However, Mr. Beck did not testify or lead any other evidence as to what these misrepresentations may have been, nor as to whether they encompass any of the passages that I have highlighted. I have no evidence to contradict Mr. Beck's explicit admissions in his email and chat line exchanges. Besides, many of these discussions, which occurred in 2004, contain messages similar to those that Mr. Beck posted on stormfront.org in 2007, after the complaint was filed and long after his conversations with the fictional Rachel had ceased. There is nothing before me to suggest that Mr. Beck was trying to impress anyone with these recent stormfront.org postings.\n[76] I also reject Mr. Fromm's submission that Mr. Beck was somehow prejudiced by the fact that the Commission had not specified prior to the hearing which portions of the bcwhitepride.com material it intended to use as evidence of s. 13 violations. I would point out that the material found on bcwhitepride.com, which was subsequently moved to bcwhitepride.org, consisted apparently of less than 30 printed pages in total, not a particularly voluminous amount of material, in my view. Mr. Beck did not assert that the Commission or CRARR had failed to disclose these pages to him prior to the hearing's opening.\n[77] Furthermore, most of the material that I have referenced in this decision, which was highlighted by Mr. Niemi in his testimony, had also been excerpted or alluded to in the complaint form that CRARR filed in 2004, and in the Commission's and CRARR's Amended Statement of Particulars, dated November 14, 2006. The hearing into the merits of the complaint began on June 18, 2007. Mr. Beck can hardly claim to have been taken by surprise in this regard. Besides, given the relatively small size of the bcwhitepride.com website (as I mentioned, less than 30 pages), I do not find that Mr. Beck suffered any prejudice by the fact that Mr. Niemi also singled out a number of passages that were not specifically mentioned in the complaint form or Amended Statement of Particulars themselves but were similar in nature. Mr. Beck knew that the Commission was challenging the content of the website as a whole. I am satisfied that this knowledge was sufficient for him to understand the case he had to meet. There was no evidence of prejudice at the hearing.\n[78] I therefore find that a reasonable explanation has not been provided in answer to the prima facie case made out against Mr. Beck. I conclude that the matter that has been found to constitute hate messages within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act was communicated repeatedly via the Internet by Mr. Beck. The complaint against Mr. Beck has therefore been substantiated.\n(ii) Did bcwhitepride.com communicate the impugned messages? [79] The impugned messages were initially viewed by Mr. Niemi on a website the home page of which had the following Internet address, as it appears at the bottom of the printout that was filed in evidence: http:\/\/members.odinarage\/bcwhitepride. CRARR brought its complaint against the person(s) directly responsible for the website, although the address given on the complaint form was somewhat more elaborate (members.odinarage\/bcwhitepride\/immigrations.htm). CRARR indicated in the complaint that the website was also known as BCWhitepride.com. On a typewritten form entitled Complaint Summary which the Commission subsequently prepared, the name and address of respondent is shown as being simply www.bcwhitepride.com. As I mentioned earlier, no one appeared before the Tribunal on behalf of bcwhitepride.com.\n[80] More importantly, I have no evidence before me that bcwhitepride.com even exists as a person or group of persons acting in concert, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act. The evidence only establishes that in 2003, one was able to access a website with an Internet address (members.odinarage\/bcwhitepride\/immigrations.htm) within which the term bcwhitepride appeared. In his preliminary ruling in this case, Member Deschamps found that a group calling itself BC White Pride did exist. However, as I mentioned earlier in this decision, I denied the Commission's motion to add the group as a party.\n[81] It is evident, in my view, that the bcwhitepride.com referred to in the complaint was meant to identify a website, a simplified version of a fairly complex Internet address, and that CRARR sought to file the complaint against the persons responsible for it, not against the website itself. Furthermore, even if one were to rely on the Commission's categorization in the complaint summary of www.bcwhitepride.com as the respondent, it has not been established that bcwhitepride.com exists as a person or group of persons, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act, capable of engaging in the discriminatory conduct contemplated therein. The complaint against bcwhitepride.com has therefore not been substantiated.\n[82] I would also note in passing that in its final submissions, the Commission advised the Tribunal that it was not seeking any remedy against www.bcwhitepride.com.\nVI. REMEDIES A. An order that the discriminatory practice cease (s. 54(1)(a)) [83] The Commission and CRARR seek an order that Mr. Beck cease and desist the discriminatory practice, pursuant to s. 54(1)(a) of the Act. Given my findings that Mr. Beck communicated hate messages within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act, such an order is justified.\n[84] I therefore order John Beck to cease and desist from communicating, by the means described in s. 13 of the Act, namely the Internet, any matter of the type contained in those messages that I have identified in this decision as being likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that the person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[85] Mr. Niemi testified that he had still been able to access the messages on the bcwhitepride.org website as recently as November 2006. If that remains the case, Mr. Beck is ordered to remove the material that has been found in breach of s. 13 from the bcwhitepride.org website or from any other location on the Internet where Mr. Beck has posted the material.\nB. Penalty (s. 54(1)(c)) [86] The Tribunal may order a respondent who engaged in a discriminatory practice set out in s. 13 of the Act, to pay a penalty of up to $10,000, pursuant to s. 54(1)(c). Section 54(1.1) enumerates several factors that the Tribunal must take into account when deciding whether to make such an order:\nThe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice, and\nThe wilfulness or intent of the respondent, any prior discriminatory practices that he or she has engaged in, and his or her ability to pay the penalty.\nThe Commission submits that these factors weigh heavily in favour of the maximum penalty available.\n[87] With regard to the first set of criteria, I find that the discriminatory practice in this case constitutes a serious and significant breach of s. 13 of the Act. It is evident that the impugned material discriminates against a wide range of people, and encompasses comments that are vicious and dehumanizing, especially with respect to the disabled, a particularly vulnerable group within society. Negative and destructive stereotypes are brought forth with respect to Jewish persons. The remarks regarding non-Whites undermine their dignity and self-worth and contribute to disharmonious relations among various races and cultures, which, as the Supreme Court commented in Taylor, supra at paragraph 42, erodes the tolerance and open-mindedness that must flourish in a multicultural society committed to the idea of equality. I would also note that the material was placed on a website that appeared to be dedicated to the communication of these very messages, in contrast to instances where the impugned material has consisted of a number of relatively short postings on message boards (see e.g., Warman v. Beaumont, supra at para. 98).\n[88] In addition, I am persuaded that Mr. Beck intentionally placed this material on the Internet knowing that the communication of these messages was likely to expose persons of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt and would thus be in breach of the Act. For instance, on the whiterenegade.org site, which Mr. Beck defined as his personal online manifesto, he expressed a passionate and holy hatred of laws preventing hate speech. In his exchanges with Mr. Martinez, Mr. Beck spoke of his contempt for those who wished to stop the kind of statements found on the bcwhitepride.com and .org websites. In my view, it is reasonable to infer from these statements that he had knowledge of the Act's provisions regarding hate messages but that he opted to wilfully breach them just the same.\n[89] I have no findings before me of any prior discriminatory practices by Mr. Beck. The material on bcwhiterenegade.org and stormfront.org, while helpful in determining Mr. Beck's involvement in the bcwhitepride.com and .org websites, was not the object of CRARR's s. 13 complaint, nor was any notice given to the responding parties that this other material was being presented with a view to establishing the existence of additional discriminatory communications. It would be a breach of procedural fairness to Mr. Beck for me to assess whether this other material would constitute a discriminatory practice under the Act. Furthermore, I have no way of knowing if the bcwhiterenegade.org material was posted prior to the impugned messages in this case. Certainly the 2007 stormfront.org postings were made well afterwards.\n[90] There is some evidence available regarding Mr. Beck's ability to pay the penalty. During the hearing on the preliminary motion to amend the complaint, the Commission produced copies of Mr. Beck's then most recent income tax return summaries, for the years 2004 and 2005. It is not necessary for me to reveal the exact amounts shown but suffice it to say that his declared total income was very modest. In addition, Mr. Martinez testified during that hearing that the information he had garnered in the course of his investigation showed that Mr. Beck lived in a garage, a fact that was fully verified by a search on an Internet-based telephone directory, 411.ca. That being said, I have no evidence as to Mr. Beck's assets or liabilities nor what his income may be in 2007.\n[91] Taking all of these factors into account, I order Mr. Beck to pay a penalty of $6,000. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of the date on which this decision is served on Mr. Beck.\nC. Witness fee [92] Mr. Beck has requested a witness fee from the Commission for his attendance, over the course of eight days in total, at the hearing on the preliminary motion to amend the complaint, which resulted in his being added as a respondent in the present case. The Commission had sought and obtained a summons from the Tribunal requiring Mr. Beck's attendance on November 27 and 28, 2006, at the hearing which was to take place in Penticton, BC. The Commission served the summons on Mr. Beck by process server together with an amount of $50.00. Mr. Beck appeared at the hearing on the designated dates. However, the start of the proceedings was postponed to the second day, November 28, 2006, due to bad weather that had delayed the Tribunal member's arrival.\n[93] The hearing on the motion continued over a total of seven days (November 28, 29 and 30, 2006, and April 10 to 13, 2007). Mr. Beck attended on each of those hearing dates, although he was not served with any other summons. Mr. Beck was ultimately never called to testify.\n[94] Mr. Beck is now seeking a witness fee with respect to his attendance at the hearings over the entire cumulative eight day period. He is also requesting reimbursement of his daily travel expenses relating to his driving by car to and from his home in Kelowna, a distance of 60 km each way, along with his daily parking fee of $4.00. He has also claimed the cost of lunch money.\n[95] Section 50(6) of the Act provides that any person summoned to attend a hearing is entitled in the discretion of the member to receive the same fees and allowances as those paid to persons summoned to attend before the Federal Court. The practice in the Federal Court is governed by rules 42 and 43 of the Federal Court Rules, which state that a witness is entitled to the fees and travel expenses set out in Tariff A of the Rules. Section 3 of the Tariff states that witness fees should be paid in the amount of $20 per day plus reasonable travel expenses, or the amount permitted in similar circumstances in the superior court of the province where the witness appears, whichever is greater.\n[96] The hearing where Mr. Beck appeared was held in British Columbia. Schedule 3 of Appendix C to the Supreme Court Rules of British Columbia, issued pursuant to the Court Rules Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 80, sets out the fees that are payable to witnesses in that province. Witnesses are entitled to a daily witness fee of $20. However, a witness who is a party or a present officer, director or partner of a party to the proceeding is not entitled to the fee. At the time of the hearing on the preliminary motion, Mr. Beck was not a party to the complaint. There is no evidence before me that he was an officer, director or partner of the sole respondent party to the case at the time, bcwhitepride.com, which, in any event, I have determined is not a person or group of persons within the meaning of s. 13. Mr. Beck only became a party pursuant to Mr. Deschamps' ruling of May 18, 2007, amending the complaint.\n[97] Schedule 3 also provides that where the hearing is held within 200 km from the witness' residence, a travel allowance of 30 cents per kilometre is payable. A reasonable allowance for meal expenses is also payable.\n[98] The Commission produced with its submissions, a copy of the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat's kilometric rates for use of privately owned vehicles driven on authorized government business travel, for the period encompassing the first two days of hearing on the preliminary motion. The rate for travel in British Columbia was 47.5 cents per kilometre at that time.\n[99] The Tribunal has the discretion to vary the amounts payable for witness fees in accordance with the circumstances of each case (see Day v. Department of National Defence, 2003 CHRT 7). I find that the Treasury Board Secretariat's travel expense rate would be reasonable in the present case. I also note that the entitlement under the rules of British Columbia's Superior Court would be lesser and, in accordance with the Federal Court Rules, would therefore not apply.\n[100] I accept Mr. Beck's claim for a witness fee in relation to the entire eight day period. The Commission never indicated that it would not be calling him as a witness, nor did it request that the summons be withdrawn or cancelled, as Mr. Deschamps pointed out when the issue of witness fees arose on the final day of the hearing on the preliminary motion (see Transcript, April 13, 2007, at pages 925-42). I note that the Tribunal's summons form, which the Commission filled out and served on Mr. Beck, states that the person being summoned must attend to give evidence at the indicated place and time of the hearing, and do so from day to day until the hearing is concluded or the Tribunal otherwise orders. The Tribunal never issued an order releasing Mr. Beck from his requirement to attend throughout the course of the hearing on the motion, nor did the Commission ask the Tribunal to do so.\n[101] The Commission argues that Mr. Beck chose to attend over the entire period because the main question at issue was whether he should be added as a respondent in the case. Mr. Beck may very well have opted to attend even if he had not been summoned, but the fact remains that he was summoned to attend at the request of the Commission and that he was not released from this requirement throughout the course of the hearing on the motion.\n[102] Consequently, I order the Commission to pay Mr. Beck a witness fee and reimburse his expenses, in the following amounts:\nA daily witness fee of $20.00 x 8 days = $160.00\n120 km (round-trip distance from home to hearing) x 47.5 cents x 8 days of hearing = $456.00;\n$4.00 parking x 8 days of hearing = $32.00;\n$15.00\/day (which I consider to be a reasonable sum for lunchtime meal expenses) x 8 days of hearing = $120.00.\nThe total to be paid by the Commission to Mr. Beck is therefore:\n$768.00 - $50.00 (the sum that I understand was already provided to Mr. Beck when he was served with the summons) = $718.00.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] Ali Tahmoupour is a Muslim Canadian who was born in Iran. He had always dreamed of becoming a police officer.\n[2] On July 12, 1999 he was given the opportunity to achieve his dreams. On that date he entered the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Training Academy in Regina, Saskatchewan (known as Depot). On October 20, 1999, Mr. Tahmourpour's training contract was terminated prior to completion of the program. Mr. Tahmourpour believes that the termination of his training contract was the culmination of three months of harassment and discrimination on the basis of his race, religion and ethnic or national origin.\n[3] Mr. Tahmourpour filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on March 21, 2001 alleging violations of sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nII. AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT [4] Mr. Tahmourpour alleged that from the first day of training at Depot he was singled out for negative treatment on the basis of his religion, race and national or ethnic origin. He stated that he was ridiculed for wearing a religious pendant and for signing his name in the Persian style. He was subject to ongoing verbal harassment, hostile treatment and negative performance evaluations by his instructors. This had the effect of undermining his confidence and impairing his ability to develop and demonstrate the necessary skills at Depot. When Mr. Tahmourpour challenged one of the instructors who was treating him negatively, the instructor in question began mounting a campaign to have him removed from Depot. At the urging of this instructor, Mr. Tahmourpour was given negative and inaccurate performance evaluations which ultimately led to his dismissal from the training program. The final act of discrimination occurred, in Mr. Tahmourpour's view, when the RCMP denied him the ability to return to the program on the basis of an inaccurate evaluation of his mental stability.\n[5] It is Mr. Tahmourpour's view that the negative treatment he received was a manifestation of systemic discrimination against visible minorities at Depot. According to him, the systemic discrimination at Depot consisted of the RCMP's failure to address a culture of disrespect and negativity towards visible minority cadets at Depot, as a result of which the attrition rates for visible minorities were higher than for non-visible minority cadets.\n[6] The RCMP denies that there was systemic discrimination at Depot during the time that Mr. Tahmourpour was there. The RCMP states that Mr. Tahmourpour's performance at Depot was fairly evaluated and found wanting. His training contract was terminated for no other reason than that he failed to meet the standards at Depot. When he was informed that his contract was terminated, Mr. Tahmourpour's negative reaction to this event demonstrated that he could not deal with challenges. Therefore, the RCMP was justified in putting a note on his file recommending that he not be considered for re-enrollment.\n[7] The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not participate in the proceedings. However, it remained a party to the proceedings and indicated its interest in any preliminary, resolution, enforcement or judicial review proceedings that might arise.\nIII. WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC ISSUES IN THIS COMPLAINT? [8] Mr. Tahmourpour alleges that the following events took place, and that they constitute harassment and differential treatment on the basis of race, religion and national or ethnic origin:\nMr. Tahmourpour was subjected to discriminatory remarks, hostile treatment and verbal abuse by instructors at Depot; Mr. Tahmourpour's performance at Depot was improperly evaluated; The Respondent terminated Mr. Tahmourpour's training contract on the basis of false pretenses; Mr. Tahmourpour was improperly designated as being ineligible for re-enrollment in the Cadet Training program at Depot; and Mr. Tahmourpour was the victim of harassment on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination while at Depot.\n[9] For the reasons that follow, I have found that Mr. Tahmourpour's complaint is substantiated.\nIV. WHAT MUST BE PROVEN WITH REGARD TO SECTION 7? [10] Section 7 of the Act defines a discriminatory practice as adverse differentiation on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[11] The Complainant has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case that he was subjected to adverse differentiation on the basis of his race, religion and ethnic or national origin. A prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28 (O'Malley); and Dhanjal v. Air Canada, (1997), 139 F\/T.R. 37 at para. 6).\n[12] The onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation that demonstrates either that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory (Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) 2005 FCA 154 at para. 26). The Tribunal must then determine, on a balance of probabilities, whether the allegation of discrimination has been substantiated.\nA. Was Mr. Tahmourpour Subjected to Discriminatory Remarks, Hostile Treatment and Verbal Abuse? (a) The Reference to Mr. Tahmourpour's Religious Pendant [13] On July 12, 1999 Mr. Tahmourpour attended his first day of Physical Training (PT) at Depot. The Instructor, Sergeant Paul H\u00e9bert (now Superintendent), instructed the cadets to change into their fitness clothing and to remove all jewelry and watches. Mr. Tahmourpour approached Sergeant H\u00e9bert to explain that he wore a religious pendant and that he did not want to remove it. Sergeant H\u00e9bert replied that this was acceptable.\n[14] Mr. Tahmourpour requested that Sergeant H\u00e9bert keep the information about his religious pendant confidential; he did not want to be singled out as different on the basis of his religious affiliation. Mr. Tahmourpour testified that contrary to his request, Sergeant H\u00e9bert announced to all of the cadets in Troop 4 that there was no jewelry to be worn during Physical Training, except for Ali here, who's allowed to wear his religious pendant. He stated that Sergeant H\u00e9bert made the comment in a loud, sarcastic and condescending voice while rolling his eyes in the direction of Mr. Tahmourpour.\n[15] Mr. Tahmourpour testified that for several days after this incident he was questioned by his troop mates about his religion and the reason he wore a pendant. He stated that this made him feel uncomfortable and concerned that he had been identified as different.\n[16] On October 14, 1999, Mr. Tahmourpour had a conversation with Sergeant H\u00e9bert during which Sergeant H\u00e9bert apologized for his comment regarding the religious pendant. According to Mr. Tahmourpour, Sergeant H\u00e9bert stated that he would employ a different method for dealing with exemptions for religious jewelry in the future.\n[17] The RCMP Dress and Hygiene Instructions provided to the cadets at the time that Mr. Tahmourpour was at Depot stipulated that no jewelry was to be worn, except for medic alert bracelets. It did not provide exceptions for religious jewelry. This put cadets in a position where they either had to remove their religious jewelry, or approach the instructor as, Mr. Tahmourpour did, to request an exemption.\n[18] On the basis of this evidence, I find that Mr. Tahmourpour has established a prima facie case that the RCMP Dress and Hygiene Instructions, and the announcement made by Sergeant H\u00e9bert in front of Troop 4, adversely differentiated against him on the basis of his religion.\nThe Respondent's Explanation\n[19] Sergeant (now Superintendent) Paul H\u00e9bert testified on behalf of the RCMP. He admitted that he made an announcement to Troop 4 that no jewelry was to be worn in PT, except for Mr. Tahmourpour, who would be permitted to wear his religious pendant.\n[20] Sergeant H\u00e9bert explained that he made the announcement to all the cadets because he did not want them to give Mr. Tahmourpour a hard time because he was not following the rule. Normally, if a cadet neglected to take jewelry off for PT, the troop would be required to do push ups as a reminder. To avoid this, the cadets would remind one and other to remove their jewelry. Sergeant H\u00e9bert felt he should announce to Troop 4 that Mr. Tahmourpour was permitted to wear his religious jewelry so that the cadets would not remind him to take it off before PT class.\n[21] Sergeant H\u00e9bert stated that Mr. Tahmourpour did not tell him that he wanted the information to be kept confidential. Had he known this, he would not have made the announcement to the entire troop. He would have told only the right marker. The right marker makes sure that the whole troop is on time for class and in proper uniform. It would be necessary to tell the right marker that an exception had been made to the uniform rule so that he or she would not give the cadet a hard time for not being in proper uniform.\n[22] Sergeant H\u00e9bert's admission that he would not have made the announcement to the entire troop had Mr. Tahmourpour asked him not to, undercuts his explanation that it was necessary to provide this information to everyone.\n[23] Sergeant H\u00e9bert also acknowledged that a better practice would have been to publicly inform the cadets about the rule and the exceptions for religious jewelry and medic alerts, without mentioning any names. Then, if there were problems arising from the use of jewelry in PT class, the instructor could approach the cadet(s) on an individual basis and discretely discuss the situation.\n[24] Sergeant H\u00e9bert stated that his tone of voice during the announcement would have been loud because it was a noisy environment. However, he would not have used a sarcastic voice because he respected people's beliefs and values.\n[25] I accept Sergeant H\u00e9bert's testimony that the announcement was made publicly to Troop 4, but in a neutral manner. This does not, however, change the fact that Mr. Tahmourpour felt that he had been identified as being different from the rest of the troop on the basis of his religion. Although several of his troop mates testified on behalf of the RCMP that they did not know about his Muslim background, this does not mean that Mr. Tahmourpour was not questioned about his religion by other cadets who did not testify.\n[26] One of the challenges that Mr. Tahmourpour faced in this case was to present evidence from his former troop mates who are now RCMP officers. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that he had difficulty finding individuals who would testify against the RCMP in this case.\n[27] Moreover, Mr. Tahmourpour's own perception that he had been identified as different is sufficient for me to find that, although unintended, the effect of the RCMP's policy with respect to dress and hygiene and Sergeant H\u00e9bert's announcement about Mr. Tahmourpour's religious pendant was to adversely differentiate against Mr. Tahmourpour on the basis of his religion. This allegation is therefore, substantiated, on a balance of probabilities.\n(b) Discriminatory Remarks and Treatment by Corporal Dan Boyer [28] The Head Instructor of the Firearms Unit was Corporal Dan Boyer. Corporal Boyer (now retired) was known for his loud, commanding presence on the Firearms Range. Many cadets were afraid of making mistakes on the Range because Corporal Boyer was harsh and brusque in his reprimands.\n[29] Mr. Tahmourpour testified that Corporal Boyer was constantly hostile and verbally abusive towards him. He stated that Corporal Boyer would stand very close to him at the firing range and scream into his ear that he was a loser, a coward, fucking useless and incompetent. Mr. Tahmourpour conceded that Corporal Boyer yelled and was verbally abusive to other cadets in Troop 4. However, he stated that Corporal Boyer directed significantly more of his negative attention towards Mr. Tahmourpour than the other cadets. This had a very negative effect on Mr. Tahmourpour's ability to perform in Firearms.\n[30] Mr. Tahmourpour stated that Corporal Boyer made it clear that he knew his behaviour was offensive. He often announced to Troop 4 that he was politically incorrect and he did not care who knew this or objected to it.\n[31] Dr. Scot Wortley, a criminologist from the University of Toronto, testified on behalf of Mr. Tahmourpour. He was qualified as an expert in racism and policing. Dr. Wortley testified that the term politically correct is pejorative and sarcastic. It is meant to convey an attitude of disdain towards human rights. Dr. Wortley stated that when a person in a position of authority states that he is politically incorrect, it may communicate the idea that the system does not take complaints of discrimination seriously and that discriminatory attitudes are tolerated.\n[32] Mr. Tahmourpour testified that on one occasion, fairly early in the training program, Corporal Boyer watched him sign an evaluation form and then stated: What kind of fucking language is that, or is it something that you've made up? Mr. Tahmourpour signs his name from right to left in the Persian style he learned when he was a child in Iran. He has continued to sign his name in this way. He was deeply offended when Corporal Boyer made the offensive remarks about his signature.\n[33] Mr. Tahmourpour stated that he was unable to concentrate and perform to capacity in Firearms because he was in constant fear of rebuke and condemnation from Corporal Boyer.\n[34] His poor performance in Firearms Training, which ultimately led the termination of his training contract, was due to Corporal Boyer's prejudicial dislike and mistreatment of him.\n[35] Sergeant Brar testified on behalf of Mr. Tahmourpour. He was an instructor and troop facilitator at Depot from 1998 to 2000. Sergeant Brar is a visible minority; he is of East Asian descent. While on the firing range with his troops, Sergeant Brar observed that Corporal Boyer focused a lot of negative attention on visible minority cadets and women (unless he appeared to find them attractive, in which case he would treat them favourably). He stated that Corporal Boyer was particularly loud and abusive with visible minority and female cadets. Corporal Boyer was more jovial with Caucasian males and attractive female cadets.\n[36] Sergeant Brar stated that he had observed that Corporal Boyer's behaviour had an effect on cadets' performance. When he yelled in their ear and berated them loudly, Sergeant Brar noticed that the cadets did not perform well.\n[37] Sergeant Brar brought Corporal Boyer's differential treatment of the women and visible minority cadets to the attention of the Officer in Charge of Depot, Inspector Keith Clark. Sergeant Brar could not recall the specific date that he reported Corporal Boyer's behaviour to Inspector Clark. He told Inspector Clark that he believed that there would be complaints of harassment and racial discrimination as a result of Corporal Boyer's behaviour. Sergeant Brar stated that Inspector Clark did not ask for any further information.\n[38] Sergeant Brar testified that he and Corporal Boyer were not on good terms during the time that he was at Depot. He stated that it was his impression, based on what he observed about Corporal Boyer's behaviour, that the latter gentleman did not like him because of his race and ethnicity.\n[39] Sergeant Brar testified about an incident between himself and Corporal Boyer in which Corporal Boyer berated Sergeant Brar for a decision that he had made with respect to one of the cadets in his troop. Sergeant Brar stated that Corporal Boyer's tone of voice and abusive language towards him on the telephone was inappropriate given that he was speaking to a colleague of the same rank. Sergeant Brar hung up on Corporal Boyer rather than allowing Corporal Boyer to continue berating him.\n[40] On the basis of the evidence above, Mr. Tahmourpour has made out a prima facie case that Corporal Dan Boyer made a derogatory remark about Mr. Tahmourpour's signature that was based on Mr. Tahmourpour's ethnic or national origin and that Corporal Boyer was verbally abusive toward Mr. Tahmourpour. This evidence, in addition to the evidence that Corporal Boyer flaunted his political incorrectness, and Sergeant Brar's evidence that he was harder on visible minority cadets and instructors than their Caucasian counterparts, provides sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish a prima facie case that Corporal Boyer's hostile and abusive conduct towards Mr. Tahmourpour was based, at least in part, on Mr. Tahmourpour's race, religion and national or ethnic origin.\nThe Respondent's Explanation\n[41] Corporal Boyer testified on behalf of the RCMP. He was a Firearms instructor at Depot from July 1996 to 2001. He admitted that he made a comment about Mr. Tahmourpour's signature. However, he stated that he did not swear at him. Corporal Boyer observed Mr. Tahmourpour signing one of the feedback forms. He noticed that Mr. Tahmourpour signed his name from right to left and then added a few scribbles at the end. The signature looked like it was written in another language. Corporal Boyer testified that he did ask Mr. Tahmourpour what language his signature was in, or whether it was just something that he had made up. Corporal Boyer testified that he asked Mr. Tahmourpour about his signature out of curiosity; he was genuinely interested in different languages. Also, he stated that Mr. Tahmourpour was signing a legal document and he wanted to make sure that it was his real signature.\n[42] Corporal Boyer admitted that he swears at work. He admitted that he was told by the troops that he yelled and was loud. He admitted that there were other complaints about him but he could not recall the specifics of any of the complaints. He said that it was possible that he had been warned about his condescending and inappropriate comments to cadets. Corporal Boyer admitted that one of his performance reviews stated that he had a filthy mouth, but that he had worked on this problem. Yet, he admitted that he still swore in front of his family and therefore, his efforts had not been entirely successful. Corporal Boyer also admitted that there had been complaints prior to his retirement that he swore at cadets.\n[43] On the basis of this evidence, I find that it is more probable than not that Corporal Boyer asked Mr. Tahmourpour: What kind of a fucking language is that, or is it something that you just made up? Corporal Boyer's statement that he was genuinely curious about other people's languages and cultures did not ring true. It sounded rehearsed and insincere. Moreover, it was inconsistent with other evidence that I heard about Corporal Boyer's tendency to degrade visible minority cadets.\n[44] His explanation with regard to the authenticity of Mr. Tahmourpour's signature did not make sense and also sounded fabricated. The manner in which Mr. Tahmourpour signed the Feedback form would have no bearing whatsoever on the authenticity or validity of the contents of the document. It simply connoted that the cadet had been given the document. Therefore, I do not accept Corporal Boyer's explanations about his signature comment.\n[45] Corporal Boyer denied that he was harder on Mr. Tahmourpour than the other cadets in Troop 4. He stated that, like a number of Firearms instructors, he was loud and aggressive. He stated that he was not a bully, although he was aware that he could possibly intimidate people. Corporal Boyer said that he used this style because Firearms was a very dangerous environment and it was critical to ensure that order and decorum was maintained at all times on the line.\n[46] Corporal Boyer stated that he was not politically correct at all times. He thought politically correct meant never swearing and yelling. He viewed Depot as a politically correct world where you don't swear and try keep things as polite as possible. Corporal Boyer stated that he swears and yells and in that sense, he is not politically correct. However, he did not see himself as racist.\n[47] Corporal Boyer was also questioned about his reaction to a direction from his supervisor that he remove the men's magazines that he had left in the men's washroom. (I infer that men's magazines refers to material depicting women in sexually explicit ways which is seen by many as not conducive to gender equality). Corporal Boyer stated that his first response to the direction to remove the magazines may have been that Depot was trying to be politically correct. Corporal Boyer stated that by that he would have meant that Depot was a fair environment and some of the material might have been offensive to people.\n[48] Corporal Boyer's evidence was not consistent or convincing. It is highly probable that he knew that political correctness meant more than not swearing, or he would not have responded that Depot was trying to be politically correct when he was told to take the men's magazines out of the washrooms. I think he knew, but was not willing to admit on the stand, that political correctness meant respecting the rights of women and minority groups, among others. I find it more probable than not that Corporal Boyer told people that he was politically incorrect, and by that he meant that he would say whatever he wanted about people even if it was sexist or racist. In my view, this is what reasonable listeners would think when they heard Corporal Boyer declaring that he was politically incorrect.\n[49] Constable Brendon McCarney testified on behalf of the RCMP. He was a visible minority member of Troop 4 during the time that Mr. Tahmourpour was in Troop 4. Constable McCarney stated that he strongly disliked Corporal Boyer. He was confrontational; he would yell at the cadets right in their faces, very close to them.\n[50] Constable McCarney was subjected to a tirade from Constable Boyer. He was stunned. He made sure that he did not repeat the mistake that prompted the reaction. He did not feel singled out, however. He stated that anyone who made a mistake was yelled at by Corporal Boyer, including Caucasian cadets.\n[51] Constable McCarney stated, however, that he considered Corporal Boyer to be politically incorrect. By that he meant someone who is rude and uses inappropriate words to refer to an individual's race, sexual orientation or colour. He stated that someone who is politically incorrect with respect to race could be called racist. In that sense, Constable McCarney thought that Corporal Boyer could be racist, although he did not use racist terms with him. Corporal Boyer was simply mean to him.\n[52] I find that Constable McCarney's evidence corroborates Mr. Tahmourpour's assertion that although Corporal Boyer was hard on all the cadets, his treatment of visible minority cadets had an added perniciousness. There is further evidence to support this conclusion in the testimony of Corporal Eldon Draudy. Corporal Draudy testified on behalf of the RCMP. He is a Caucasian male. Corporal Draudy stated that he found Corporal Boyer to be very intimidating. He was afraid of making mistakes because Corporal Boyer would yell in a very loud voice if a mistake was made. Corporal Draudy did make a mistake. Corporal Boyer yelled at him for not having his head in the game and for not concentrating. Corporal Boyer told him that he could put his life or someone else's life in danger.\n[53] Corporal Draudy did not refer to Corporal Boyer as mean or abusive as did Sergeant Brar, Constable McCarney and Mr. Tahmourpour (all visible minorities). Rather, Corporal Draudy stated that he appreciated Corporal Boyer's approach because the range is a dangerous place and Corporal Boyer had to maintain strict control over it to ensure that no one was hurt. Corporal Draudy's experience of being corrected by Corporal Boyer was quite different from the experiences of the visible minority members and cadets who testified. Corporal Draudy was told that he did not have his head in the game, a comment that would be considerably easier to accept than being told, as Mr. Tahmourpour was, that he was fucking useless.\n[54] On the basis of this evidence I find it more likely than not that Corporal Boyer treated visible minority cadets differently and more negatively than non-visible minority candidates. I also find it more probable than not that Corporal Boyer was verbally abusive and hostile towards Mr. Tahmourpour at least in part on the basis of his race, religion, ethnicity or national origin.\n[55] Corporal Boyer denied that he was racist; he has many friends and family members who are from visible minority groups. However, in assessing the weight to be accorded to such a statement, I must consider that it is quite possible that Corporal Boyer's attitudes with respect to visible minority cadets and RCMP officers are markedly different from his attitudes towards his friends and family.\n[56] There was evidence from an RCMP survey of Regular Members in 1996 that indicated that 51 percent of Caucasian male members felt resentment towards their visible minority, female and Aboriginal colleagues in the RCMP, based on their perception that employment equity initiatives have given these RCMP officers an unfair advantage. There was no evidence that this attitude had changed between 1996 and 1999 when Mr. Tahmourpour was attending training at Depot.\n[57] Corporal Boyer was, like all of the instructors and facilitators at Depot, a regular member of the RCMP. In my view, it is a reasonable inference, based on the Regular Members' Survey and on the evidence presented about Corporal Boyer's behaviour at Depot, that his behaviour toward Mr. Tahmourpour may have been based, at least in part, on resentment that he, like many regular Caucasian Males, felt towards members of visible minority groups and women in the RCMP.\n[58] In conclusion, I find that Corporal Boyer made a derogatory comment about Mr. Tahmourpour's signature that was based on a prohibited ground of discrimination. He also adversely differentiated against Mr. Tahmourpour on the basis of a prohibited ground by being especially verbally abusive and hostile towards Mr. Tahmourpour at Depot.\nB. The Evaluation of Mr. Tahmourpour's Performance at Depot (a) The First Evaluation [59] On September 10, 1999, Mr. Tahmourpour received a Cadet Performance Feedback Sheet dated September 8, 1999 that listed 12 NI's in Applied Police Sciences (APS). NI signifies needs improvement. An NI is assigned when a cadet's performance is deficient, even if only slightly so. Cadets are provided with written notification when they receive an NI. If a cadet receives two NI's in the same competency, he or she is given a U, or an Unacceptable rating.\n[60] The criticism in the September 8, 1999 Feedback document focused on Mr. Tahmourpour's alleged weaknesses in communication skills, group participation, self-assessment, ability to handle stress, and decision-making skills. A number of examples were provided that allegedly demonstrated his weaknesses in these areas. Mr. Tahmourpour was given one month to improve his performance; a meeting was set to discuss his progress.\n[61] Mr. Tahmourpour alleged that almost all aspects of the September 8, 1999 evaluation were false. He stated that his performance to that point in time was no more deficient than that of any other cadet, and that the negative assessments constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of his race, religion and ethnic or national origin. In the alternative, if his performance was weak in any of the areas listed in the evaluation, it was because of the discriminatory treatment he was receiving. Unlike his fellow cadets, he was not provided with a non-discriminatory environment in which to develop and demonstrate his capabilities.\n[62] I will deal with two of the examples provided in the September 8, 1999 evaluation: Mr. Tahmourpour's weak communication skills and the pepper spray incident, the latter of which allegedly demonstrated his weaknesses in the handling stress and decision-making. These two examples are illustrative of the issues raised in this case.\n(i) Mr. Tahmourpour's Communication Skills\n[63] Mr. Tahmourpour's facilitators reported that he had a lot of difficulty in listening and communicating effectively. He demonstrated this during an anger management simulation on August 18, 1999. At the time, Mr. Tahmourpour failed to listen to clients who were offering a suitable course of action. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that although he did not perform remarkably well during this session, his performance was certainly no worse than other cadets in his Troop.\n[64] Another example that was provided in the September 8th evaluation of Mr. Tahmourpour's poor listening and communication skills involved the community consultative group scenario. Scenarios are role plays of situations that occur during the course of police work. They require the cadets to apply the information and skills that they have acquired in training to solve the problem in the scenario.\n[65] Mr. Tahmourpour volunteered to play the role of a police officer whose task was to facilitate a community meeting regarding an issue of concern to local residents. Corporals Bradley and Jacques reported that the members of a fictitious community brought different problems to the table and what started as a constructive meeting ended up in a destructive situation where community members were obviously upset with the police officer. They stated that this occurred because Mr. Tahmourpour failed to use good communication and consensus-building skills to define the problem and arrive at a solution. He failed to listen to the community members and seemed to have his own agenda.\n[66] In contrast, Mr. Tahmourpour stated that the community meeting went very well. He stated that the residents of the community wanted the by-laws changed so that guests to their home would not receive parking tickets when they visited. He told them that the law was the law, and that he would try to work through the appropriate channels to see what could be done. Mr. Tahmourpour thought that all of the participants were quite happy with that result. His troop mates gave him positive feedback on his handling of the incident.\nThe Respondent's Explanation\n[67] Corporal (now Inspector) Bradley testified that from the beginning, she perceived that Mr. Tahmourpour had a great deal of difficulty in scenario training. He had difficulty reading the environment and responding appropriately. She stated that his difficulties stemmed from poor communication skills. Communication skills are more than just speaking. They involve listening, taking in information and responding appropriately. As a result of his inability to communicate effectively, Mr. Tahmourpour was poor in all aspects of risk assessment, police and public safety assessment and interactions with suspects.\n[68] Corporal Bradley stated that Mr. Tahmourpour was given regular verbal feedback about his communication skills. For example, in the anger management scenario, Mr. Tahmourpour was unable to respond to the cues and to use the techniques that he had been taught. In keeping with the standard procedure, his performance was critiqued after the scenario. Corporals Jacques and Bradley testified that the feedback would have been provided in a constructive way.\n[69] With regard to the Community Consultative Group, Corporal Bradley stated that Mr. Tahmourpour seemed to have formulated an approach to dealing with the problems presented in the meeting. Regardless of the information or emotion that was presented to him, he would not deviate from his plan. The result was that he did not listen to people and would not react to what they were saying. The group became increasingly angry when they perceived that Mr. Tahmourpour was not responding to the issues they were raising. He did not use the techniques that had been taught to engage in interest-based negotiation such as paraphrasing, identifying interests, asking questions, reading emotions and saying things like ok, I can see that this is really important to you, what can we do to help you with this?\n[70] Inspector Bradley provided credible testimony regarding Mr. Tahmourpour's communication difficulties. She performed well during a rigorous cross-examination on this point. When challenged, for example, about the fact that Mr. Tahmourpour's peers thought that he remained in control throughout the Community Consultative Group, Inspector Bradley stated that it was not inconsistent to remain in control of the group (which was generally positive) and yet, be unresponsive to the needs and interests that were being raised during the meeting. She did not waiver in her assessment that Mr. Tahmourpour's performance during this meeting was unacceptable. She was able to respond to the questions put to her by counsel for the Complainant in a calm, straightforward manner. She was assertive and forthright, and spoke with conviction and an air of candour that I found convincing.\n[71] In contrast, I found Mr. Tahmourpour's evidence on the issue of his communication skills to be less credible. He asserted that his performance in the Community Consultative Group was excellent because he came up with a solution. It appeared to me that he did not fully appreciate that there is more to communication than expressing one's own ideas and coming up with a solution to a problem. For example, when Mr. Tahmourpour was asked what he thought was meant by active listening he stated that he thought that it meant taking good notes.\n[72] Mr. Tahmourpour also demonstrated his weakness in self-assessment during the hearing. He agreed in cross-examination that he might have some weaknesses in communication skills. Yet, when asked what these weaknesses were, Mr. Tahmourpour was unable to identify any area. He often repeated that, like everyone, he had areas that he needed to work on. But, when pressed on what those might be, he was evasive.\n[73] Therefore, I think it more probable than not that by September 8, 1999 Mr. Tahmourpour had demonstrated that he was failing to develop certain communication skills that are essential to police work: active listening, consensus building, interest-based negotiation, and speaking in a commanding tone of voice. The first part of Mr. Tahmourpour's prima facie case, therefore, is not made out.\n[74] However, Mr. Tahmourpour asserted, in the alternative, that his weaknesses at Depot resulted from the constant unfounded criticism that he received at Depot. Mr. Tahmourpour did receive a lot of attention from the instructors at Depot. Some of the attention he received came in the form of sincere efforts to assist him to overcome weaknesses in areas such as communication skills. However, as I have already noted, he was also subjected to verbal harassment and derogatory remarks by Corporal Boyer that were based, at least in part, on his race, religion and\/or ethnic or cultural background. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that he felt intimidated and his confidence was seriously undermined by this treatment.\n[75] Mr. Tahmourpour testified about his feelings of alienation and vulnerability arising from a session on sensitivity training that was held early in the program. He stated that Corporal Jacques introduced the session by stating: This is the session where we are going to teach you all how to be politically correct so that you don't get yourselves into trouble. After that introduction, one cadet stated: Let's go to Fort McMurry, eh. Then another cadet quipped: Let's stop for some photocopier juice and some varsol first, eh? The cadets imitated the accent of some Aboriginal Canadians when they made these statements. Apparently, many of the cadets laughed at these remarks. According to Mr.Tahmourpour, Corporal Jacques did not object to the statements or reprimand the cadets for making them. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that he felt extremely uncomfortable and alienated from his troop mates as a result of these obviously racist comments.\n[76] The Respondent did not provide any evidence in response to these allegations. Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the events occurred as described by Mr. Tahmourpour and that their effect was to make Mr. Tahmourpour feel vulnerable to racism at Depot.\n[77] It is generally understood that racism and discriminatory treatment in general have a detrimental effect on the victim's ability to function effectively in the workplace (see for example: Nkwazi v. Correctional Service Canada [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 29 at para. 119; Naraine v. Ford Motor Co. [1996] O.H.R.B.I.D. No. 23 at para. 93, rev'd on an another point: (2001), 209 D.L.R. (4th) 465 (O.C.A.); Hinds v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission) [1988] C.H.R.D. No. 13). Therefore, in analyzing the particular allegations in a human rights complaint, the complainant's conduct must be assessed in the context of the wider work environment. If the work, (or in this case, training) environment was poisoned with discrimination and harassment, the Tribunal must determine whether this affected the complainant's conduct or performance.\n[78] When I consider Mr. Tahmourpour's conduct in the context of the discriminatory treatment he was experiencing at Depot, I find it more probable than not that this treatment was a factor in the difficulty he was having in developing and demonstrating acceptable communication skills. In an atmosphere where racial intolerance and harassment is tacitly condoned, and where cadets like Mr. Tahmourpour are subjected to verbal abuse and bullying, it is reasonable to infer that their performance will be negatively affected. For that reason, I find that although the facilitators' criticism of his communication skills was likely an accurate reflection of what they were seeing, it was not necessarily an accurate reflection of Mr. Tahmourpour's true abilities in this area. Mr. Tahmourpour was not provided with a non-discriminatory environment in which to develop and demonstrate his communication skills. Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities that the second part of Mr. Tahmourpour's prima facie case with respect to this aspect of the September 10, 1999 evaluation has been made out.\n(ii) The Pepper Spray Incident\n[79] On August 26, 1999, Troop 4 participated in a session where they received pepper spray in the face and then performed a series of tasks. The purpose of the session was to provide the cadets with a personal experience of the effects of pepper spray and to evaluate their performance under stress. Each cadet was matched with a partner whose role was to assist his or her troop mate afterwards to wash the spray out of the eyes and to recover. The cadets lined up with their partners. When their names were called, one cadet moved forward to receive the spray, while the other stayed close at hand to assist.\n[80] In the Cadet Performance Feedback Sheet dated September 8, 1999, Corporals Bradley and Jacques stated that prior to the pepper spray session, Mr. Tahmourpour was so nervous that he did not think he could go through with it. They further stated that during the testing, his anxiety made him oblivious to his surroundings. As a result, he was missing from the line-up when his partner was about to be sprayed. Other troop mates had to locate him so that he could look after his partner.\n[81] Mr. Tahmourpour testified that the evaluation of his performance during the pepper spray session was inaccurate. In his view, he did very well during the session. He was not missing when it was his partner's turn to be sprayed; he was right there to assist him as required.\n[82] Mr. Tahmourpour stated that the pepper spray evaluation was one of a number of false evaluations that were included in the September 8, 1999 Feedback document in order to make a case against him at the instigation of Corporal Boyer. Corporal Boyer had taken a prejudicial dislike to him and was doing everything he could to have his training contract terminated, according to Mr. Tahmourpour.\n[83] According to Mr. Tahmourpour, the September 8 evaluation in APS was completed on September 9 or 10, after he had had a confrontation with Corporal Boyer on September 9, 1999. On September 9, Corporal Boyer gave Mr. Tahmourpour a U for having a dirty pistol. Mr. Tahmourpour disagreed that his pistol was dirty. He asked for a second opinion. Corporal Boyer then flew into a rage and stated: Get the fuck out of my face or I'll kick your ass. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that the two men nearly came to blows, but because Mr. Tahmourpour backed down, they did not. Mr. Tahmourpour alleged that the September 8 Feedback in APS and was trumped up in response to suggestions from Corporal Boyer.\n[84] As proof that the evaluation was prepared in response to Corporal Boyer's pressure, Mr. Tahmourpour pointed to the fact that prior to September 8, 1999, he had only received formal feedback in Police Defensive Tactics and Firearms. He had received no formal feedback in APS for which Corporal Bradley and Corporal Jacques were the instructors. Then suddenly, on September 8, 1999 he received 12 NI's in APS. According to Mr. Tahmourpour, the September 8, 1999 was the first time that he learned that his performance in APS was seriously deficient. Contrary to the Cadet Assessment Procedures, he had not been told at the time of many of the incidents cited in the evaluation, that his performance was deficient. Those incidents date as far back as August 18, 1999 - about three weeks prior to the issuance of the formal feedback. The pepper spray incident was almost a full 2 weeks prior to the September 8, 1999 Feedback. If his performance had been deficient at that time, he should have been made aware of it then.\n[85] According to the Cadet Assessment Procedures, if no formal feedback is received, a cadet can assume that his or her performance is at the Professional (or P) level. Feedback is to be given immediately or as soon as possible after the event occurred so that the cadet has time to improve. Mr. Tahmourpour did not receive any formal feedback at the time of many of the incidents cited in the September 8, 1999 evaluation, and specifically for the pepper spray session on August 26, 1999. This constituted a significant deviation from the standard evaluation procedure. Together with the timing of the evaluation, it suggests that there was another factor influencing the Feedback on September 8, 1999 besides the instructors' concerns about Mr. Tahmourpour's performance.\n[86] Corporal Boyer had already demonstrated a prejudicial dislike towards Mr. Tahmourpour. Corporal Jacques and Corporal Boyer were in close contact with one and other since they both taught Firearms. Therefore, it is likely that Corporal Boyer had an influence on Corporal Jacques' opinion of Mr. Tahmourpour.\n[87] On the basis of the evidence presented by Mr. Tahmourpour, I find that he has established a prima facie case that he was treated differently from the other cadets in the evaluation of his performance in the pepper spray incident, and that his status as a visible minority cadet was a factor in this treatment.\nThe Respondent's Explanation\n(i) What happened at the Pepper Spray Session?\n[88] Corporal Brendon McCarney provided a DVD of some of the troop's activities and training sessions. One of the activities that was recorded on the DVD was the pepper spray session. There was only one pepper spray session per troop at Depot.\n[89] Corporal McCarney testified that the troop hired a videographer to record a selection of activities to keep as a memento of their experiences at Depot. The DVD recording did not include all of the activities and sessions at Depot. The Tribunal accepted the DVD as evidence with the proviso that it did not represent the entirety of the experiences at Depot. Therefore, the events that are portrayed in the DVD must be examined in the context of all of the evidence presented during the hearing.\n[90] The DVD recording showed Troop 4 marching in to the area where the pepper spraying was to take place. They were in two lines. Mr. Tahmourpour was in a line beside Cadet Lasson, who was his partner for the pepper spray session. The DVD recording showed that Mr. Tahmourpour was not missing when Cadet Lasson was being sprayed: the video shows that Mr. Tahmourpour was, at that point in time, there to help his partner, Cadet Lasson. Cadet Meyer, however, was not there immediately when his partner, Cadet Lyle, was due to be sprayed in the face. The recording shows that a call went out to wait until Cadet Meyer was located. It would appear, therefore, on the basis of the DVD recording, that it was Cadet Meyer who was not there to assist his partner, not Mr. Tahmourpour.\n[91] Like the other cadets who testified in this case, Corporal McCarney had no recollection that any of the cadets were missing when their partner was being sprayed. However, when he watched the DVD again, he acknowledged that Cadet Meyer had to be located when his partner, Cadet Lyle, was about to be sprayed. He also acknowledged that the DVD showed that Mr. Tahmourpour was there when his partner, Cadet Lasson, was about to be sprayed. He stated that the cadets received only one treatment of pepper spray each.\n[92] Corporal Bradley was not present at the pepper spray incident; she had no recollection of the events other than what she had been told by Corporal Jacques. Corporal Bradley admitted that from what she observed on the recording, Mr. Tahmourpour was there for his partner and performed as well as the other cadets during the pepper spray test. However, she stood by the information that was provided to her by her fellow troop facilitator, Corporal Jacques, that at some point in time, Mr. Tahmourpour was not there for his partner when he was pepper-sprayed and had to be located.\n[93] Corporal Jacques stated that the problem with Mr. Tahmourpour's conduct was that he did not line up with the troop before the pepper spray session commenced. His troop mates had to find him and get him into line with the rest of the troop so that he could support his partner while he was being pepper sprayed. The line-up prior to the commencement of the pepper spray session was not shown on the DVD.\n[94] Corporal Jacques admitted in cross-examination that, contrary to his usual practice, he did not make a note of Mr. Tahmourpour's failure in his diary. He also admitted that he usually made notes in his diary of significant training events. He kept thorough notes about Mr. Tahmourpour's progress, but this incident was not in his notes.\n[95] There was another problem with Corporal Jacques' testimony. In spite of the witness exclusion order that was in effect, Corporal Jacques was informed prior to testifying about the DVD recording of the pepper spray incident and the difficulty that the previous witnesses had experienced in reconciling the content of the recording with the Feedback document indicating that Mr. Tahmourpour was absent when his partner was about to be pepper sprayed. This provided Corporal Jacques with an opportunity to present his evidence in a way that would address this difficulty. As a result, the witness exclusion order was effectively circumvented. This caused me to question the authenticity of the evidence that Corporal Jacques provided on this point. I am not sure that he would have recalled the moment when Mr. Tahmourpour was allegedly absent from the line-up had he not been provided an opportunity to consider the evidence that had been presented prior to testifying. Furthermore, the event was not noted in his diary, and he relied extensively on those notes to refresh his memory.\n[96] Finally, Corporal Jacques testified that Mr. Tahmourpour was not in line when the troop was preparing for the exercise. Yet, the Feedback document indicates that Mr. Tahmourpour was not ready when his partner was about to be sprayed. The wording of the Feedback document suggests a much more immediate absence from his place in line. It suggests the kind of conduct that was observed from Cadet Meyer who was not there when his partner was about to be sprayed.\n[97] On the basis of this evidence, therefore, I find that Mr. Tahmourpour's description of the pepper spray incident is more probable. He was, in fact, there for his partner when the time came for Cadet Lasson to be sprayed. He may have been nervous about the incident, but no more so than the other cadets appeared to be for what was clearly an intensely unpleasant and stressful event. I find therefore, that the Feedback document was not accurate.\n(ii) Was the September 8, 1999 Feedback influenced by Corporal Boyer?\n[98] The timing of the September 8, 1999 Feedback suggests that parts of it may have been fabricated, or at the very least, hastily and inaccurately prepared on September 9 or 10, in response to the incident that occurred on September 9, 1999 between Corporal Boyer and Mr. Tahmourpour. Based on the evidence that I heard, I think it more probable than not that part of the Feedback document was prepared on September 8, 1999 on a computer at Depot, and then additions were later made to it on September 9 or 10, 1999.\n[99] Corporal Boyer stated that he could not recall inspecting Mr. Tahmourpour's pistol on September 9, 1999. He denied, however, that he had threatened to beat Mr. Tahmourpour up on that day. He stated that he would have been in severe trouble had he done such a thing. He admitted, however, that he has used the term kick your ass in other contexts with cadets.\n[100] Corporal Boyer also could not recall if Mr. Tahmourpour had asked for a second opinion regarding the pistol's cleanliness. Corporal Boyer stated that if a cadet asked for a second opinion, he would calmly deny it and move on. Even though he admitted to being authoritarian, he stated that he would not be upset to hear a cadet make that kind of request. Corporal Boyer's testimony on this point is not consistent with the evidence that I heard about Corporal Boyer's temper on the range, nor with what he himself said about his manner with cadets and his propensity to swear. Corporal Boyer would not, in my view, have taken a challenge to his authority lightly.\n[101] I think it is more probable than not that Mr. Tahmourpour did challenge Corporal Boyer's assessment of the cleanliness of his weapon and asked for a second opinion. I accept Mr. Tahmourpour's version of what happened when he did so. His evidence on this point was most consistent with other evidence in this case.\n[102] Mr. Tahmourpour alleged that after the confrontation occurred, Corporal Boyer falsely issued 2 NI's and a U in Firearms on September 9, 1999, and then urged his fellow instructor, Corporal Jacques to issue negative feedback to Mr. Tahmourpour also.\n[103] Corporals Bradley and Jacques denied that this was the case. However, Corporal Bradley did admit that the instructors spoke to one and other about the cadets' performance and that Corporal Boyer was not one to keep his opinions to himself.\n[104] Corporal Jacques, who taught APS with Corporal Bradley, was also cross-trained to Firearms and worked closely with Corporal Boyer. That meant that Corporal Jacques taught both APS and Firearms at Depot. Corporal Jacques struck me as someone who might well be influenced by an experienced officer with an extremely strong personality like Corporal Boyer.\n[105] Interestingly, on September 10, 1999 Corporal Jacques noted in his diary that Mr. Tahmourpour did not have the basic qualities to be a police officer. Yet, up until September Mr. Tahmourpour's performance at Depot had not merited a single NI other than two in Firearms and one for improper handcuffing in PDT. Out of the blue, on September 10, 1999, Mr. Tahmourpour was presented with a performance evaluation indicating that he had 12 NI's in APS. In cross-examination, Corporal Jacques was asked: If during July and August, Mr. Tahmourpour demonstrated that he lacked the basic qualities to be a police officer, and was so clearly off the mark, why had he not received a single NI in APS during that time?\n[106] Corporal Jacques responded that Mr. Tahmourpour was given informal verbal feedback on an ongoing and immediate basis that his performance in the areas outlined in the September 8th evaluation was weak. Some of the NI's would have come as a surprise to him, but not all. He would have known from the feedback that was being given to him on a regular basis that his performance was below what was expected.\n[107] Corporal Bradley stated that early in the program, it does not make sense to give the cadets formal feedback for the many mistakes they are making. The provision of formal feedback at this stage of training could result in the early and unfair termination of a training contract. Therefore, cadets are given informal verbal feedback and time to improve before formal feedback is issued.\n[108] However, in my view providing Mr. Tahmourpour with verbal feedback that he could improve in certain areas would certainly not have signaled to him that his performance was so deficient that he was at risk of receiving 12 NI's in APS. Corporal Jacques' admission that some of the NI's would have come as a surprise to Mr. Tahmourpour indicates that, contrary to the Cadet Assessment Procedures, Mr. Tahmourpour was not given immediate feedback on his performance in all respects, and that the September 8 Feedback was, therefore, a deviation from the standard practice at Depot.\n[109] The Respondent failed to provide a reasonable explanation as to why the standard practice was not followed in this case. Furthermore, it has not refuted Mr. Tahmourpour's assertion that Corporal Boyer's discriminatory conduct towards Mr. Tahmourpour was a factor in the September 8, 1999 Feedback. On the contrary, Corporal Jacques' response to a question about the Cadet Cumulative Data Sheet led me to the conclusion that he prepared at least some of the September 8 Feedback after the incident between Corporal Boyer and Mr. Tahmourpour over the pistol inspection. This supports the theory that discrimination was a factor in the September 8 Feedback.\n[110] The Cadet Cumulative Data Sheet (CCDS) is a document that is used by the troop facilitators to keep track of all the Feedback that is given to the cadets by the various instructors at Depot, and the dates on which the Feedback is provided. It is a master evaluation sheet. Feedback from the instructors is usually recorded on the CCDS in chronological order. However, in Mr. Tahmourpour's case, the 2 NI's and 1 U in Firearms that he was given on September 9, 1999, were entered before the 12 NI's that were purportedly given to Mr. Tahmourpour on September 8, 1999.\n[111] Corporal Bradley explained that this sometimes happens when instructors provide their Feedback forms late or the facilitators have not had time to update the Cumulative Data Sheet. However, in this case, it was the facilitators who were preparing the September 8th Feedback and who should have been able to enter that on the Cumulative Data Sheet immediately after preparing it. Then, when the Feedback was received from Firearms on or after September 9, 1999, it would have been entered after the September 8th Feedback from the facilitators.\n[112] Corporal Jacques was questioned about this anomaly. His answer was equivocal. He stated: the only thing that I can think of now is that the three Feedback Sheets that were dated September 9, from Firearms were entered first, while I was working on the other uh ... before the other document was served to Cadet, Mr. Tahmourpour and that's why it got entered after the September 9th Feedback Sheets. The first part of Corporal Jacques' answer (before the uh) suggests that he was working on the September 8th Feedback Sheet containing the 12 NI's on September 9 or later, when the three Feedback Forms (containing the 2 NI's and a U) from Corporal Boyer came in. This lends credence to Mr. Tahmourpour's theory that the Feedback he received from Corporals Bradley and Jacques was influenced, at least in part, by Corporal Boyer's negative impressions of him. I think that the second part of Corporal Jacques' statement was an attempt to put a different spin on what happened.\n[113] Therefore, I find that it is more probable than not that Corporal Jacques was influenced by Corporal Boyer's racist attitude towards Mr. Tahmourpour. Corporal Jacques responded to that influence by providing an inaccurate evaluation of Mr. Tahmourpour's performance during the pepper spray session.\n[114] Accordingly, I find that discrimination was a factor in the September 8th Feedback regarding Mr. Tahmourpour's performance in APS.\n(b) Corporal Boyer's Request for File Review\n[115] On September 30, 1999, Corporal Boyer made a request for the review of Mr. Tahmourpour's file. A file review is the first step in the process of terminating a cadet's contract.\n[116] The Cadet Assessment Procedures stipulate that a cadet's contract will be terminated if the cadet receives 2 U's in the same competency during one assessment period, with no improvement shown. A contract may also be terminated if the cadet receives a total of 2 U's in different or the same Competencies.\n[117] Corporal Boyer made the request for a file review on the basis of 2 U's and 5 NI's in Firearms. The feedback related to a number of issues within Firearms such as the manipulation and handling of a shotgun and a pistol, the proper loading of a firearm, failing the shooting accuracy benchmarks and finally pistol cleanliness.\n[118] Mr. Tahmourpour took issue with some, but not all of the evaluations that were given to him in Firearms. In particular, he alleged that the 2 U's that he was given for having a dirty pistol on September 9, 1999 and September 28, 1999, were fabricated by Corporal Boyer to build a case for the termination of his contract.\n[119] Mr. Tahmourpour received an NI for having a dirty pistol on August 26, 1999. He took this negative evaluation very much to heart. He cleared the NI by presenting a clean pistol on two subsequent occasions. He became an expert in cleaning a pistol. He cleaned pistols for everyone in the troop and they passed their weapons inspection; he did not, however.\n[120] Mr. Tahmourpour stated that on September 9th when he received a U for a dirty pistol, he knew his weapon was in pristine condition. Therefore, he disputed Corporal Boyer's assertion that it was dirty and merited a U. Furthermore, he stated that if his pistol was truly dirty, he should have received an NI, not a U, since he had cleared the previous NI, and therefore, was starting fresh.\n[121] Mr. Tahmourpour testified that on September 28, 1999, he again presented his pistol for inspection, this time to Corporal Jacques. Corporal Jacques claimed that it was dirty. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that it was not dirty. After further inspection and attempts to dislodge the dirt, Corporal Jacques agreed with Mr. Tahmourpour that there was a textured discoloration in the magazine part of the weapon. This was a design flaw, not dirt. He permitted Mr. Tahmourpour to go on the range and shoot with the pistol. After the shooting, Corporal Boyer approached Mr. Tahmourpour and insisted that his weapon had been dirty and that he would have to sign the feedback document assigning him a U. Mr. Tahmourpour protested, stating that Corporal Boyer had not even been present for the inspection.\n[122] The Feedback documents for both dirty pistol incidents were drafted and signed by Corporal Jacques. They did not indicate who had performed the inspections.\n[123] Corporal Boyer concluded his request for a file review by stating that according to the Cadet Assessment Procedures, 2 U's in the same competency meant that file review should be requested with a view to terminating the cadet's training contract.\n[124] Mr. Tahmourpour presented credible evidence that his pistol was clean when he presented it for inspection on September 9 and 28, but Corporal Boyer judged it to be dirty. Mr. Tahmourpour has, therefore, established a prima facie case that Corporal Boyer treated him differently than other cadets with respect to the evaluation of his performance in the Firearms Unit. Given the discriminatory statements and verbal abuse of Mr. Tahmourpour by Corporal Boyer, I find, on a prima facie basis, that the differential treatment with respect to the evaluation of Mr. Tahmourpour's performance and the consequent request for file review were based, at least in part, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nThe Respondent's Explanation\n[125] The Respondent asserted that the evaluation of Mr. Tahmourpour's performance in Firearms was entirely fair and accurate; Mr. Tahmourpour's pistol was dirty on September 8, 1999 and on September 28, 1999.\n[126] Corporal Boyer explained that there is an unwritten policy in Firearms that a cadet is automatically assigned a U if his or her pistol is dirty in situations where he or she has had a previous NI for pistol cleanliness, even if that NI has been cleared. There is no discretion according to Corporal Boyer. Corporal Jacques however, did not mention this policy; he simply stated that if the pistol is found to be dirty a second or third time and it is clear that no effort has been made, the cadet will receive formal feedback. Sergeant Guay (now Chief Superintendent), the officer in charge of Firearms instruction at the time, testified that a U is given when a weapon is consistently dirty.\n[127] On the basis of the evidence that I heard, I was not convinced on a balance of probabilities, that Corporal Boyer's statement about the automatic U for a second dirty pistol was accurate. Given the serious consequences of receiving a U, I think it more likely than not that if there was an automatic U policy with respect to gun cleanliness, it would be set out in the Cadet Assessment Procedures. Certainly, the cadets and the instructors would have to be made aware of the policy. Yet, none of the other witnesses in this case testified about such a policy. Therefore, I find that it was a discretionary decision on the part of the Firearms instructor to assign an NI or a U for a second dirty pistol.\n[128] The Respondent's evidence with regard to the pistol inspection on September 9, 1999 was weak: Corporal Boyer could not recall that inspection, and Corporal Jacques did not address either of the two pistol inspections in his testimony. The note in the Request for File Review states that on September 9th the pistol was filthy.\n[129] In contrast, Mr. Tahmourpour's evidence about the pistol inspection on September 9, 1999 was clear and unshaken on cross-examination. He knew that his pistol was clean. He had become an expert in cleaning pistols. However, to be sure that it was clean, Mr. Tahmourpour had asked a fellow troop mate to check it before the September 9th inspection. Although none of the troop mates who testified could recall checking his pistol, Corporal Draudy stated that it was common to do so. He said that it was likely that Mr. Tahmourpour would have had his pistol checked before presenting for inspection. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that he knew he could not afford to make any mistakes in training at this point. He was so sure that his pistol was clean that when Corporal Boyer told him that it was dirty, he demanded a second opinion.\n[130] Corporals Bradley and H\u00e9bert stated that in situations where there was a disagreement, it is a good idea to obtain a second opinion. Sergeant Guay, on the other hand, thought that this was inappropriate. There was, however, evidence that second opinions were provided on occasion in training, and that Firearms Instructors would inspect pistols together to ensure that they had properly assessed their cleanliness. Yet, Corporal Boyer refused to do this. He was angry that Mr. Tahmourpour had the temerity to ask for a second opinion. Therefore, he assigned Mr. Tahmourpour a U, even though he could have assigned an NI if the pistol had in fact, been dirty.\n[131] Mr. Tahmourpour's evidence stands as the clearest account of what happened on September 9, 1999. The Respondent has not refuted Mr. Tahmourpour's assertion that his pistol was clean on September 9, 1999.\n[132] Corporal Boyer had a clear recollection of the September 28th inspection. However, his description of the incident differed greatly from that of Mr. Tahmourpour. Corporal Boyer said that he did the inspection himself. He found that Mr. Tahmourpour had done a good job of cleaning most of the pistol. However, he had missed a piece of carbon in a portion of the barrel where residue is often found. Corporal Boyer was able to dislodge this piece of carbon quite easily with a pen.\n[133] Mr. Tahmourpour, on the other hand, claimed that Corporal Jacques inspected his pistol on September 28 and had agreed with him, upon closer inspection, that the apparent dirt was in fact, a textured discoloration inside the gun.\n[134] The issue thus boils down to one of credibility. Unfortunately, neither gentleman provided consistently credible testimony throughout the hearing. Both had a tendency to present evidence in a manner to suit their own purposes. This made it difficult to determine what really happened.\n[135] As is often the case, it is probable that the truth lies somewhere between the two versions of the events. My best assessment of the evidence is that Corporal Jacques inspected Mr. Tahmourpour's pistol on September 28, 1999. He told Mr. Tahmourpour that his pistol was dirty. Mr. Tahmourpour, however, insisted that the dirt was really a textured discoloration. Rather than getting into a fight with Mr. Tahmourpour over this, Corporal Jacques sent him onto the Range to practice shooting. (There was evidence that this was done to teach cadets the effect of having a dirty pistol.) Later, when Corporal Boyer was told what had happened, he inspected Mr. Tahmourpour's gun to see if there was a textured discoloration. He found no such flaw. He was able to flake the carbon in Mr. Tahmourpour's gun off with a pen. Since Mr. Tahmourpour had just been firing his gun, it is likely that there would have been carbon in the barrel.\n[136] I do not think that it can be said, with any degree of accuracy, whether Mr. Tahmourpour's pistol was dirty on the 28th. What can be said, however, is that there were two very negative encounters on September 9 and September 28, 1999, regarding the cleanliness of Mr. Tahmourpour's pistol that were not handled well by Corporal Boyer. He exhibited a degree of animosity towards Mr. Tahmourpour that is not fully explained by the fact that Mr. Tahmourpour challenged his instructors' opinions.\n[137] A request for a file review is made only when a cadet has received two U's in the same competency (which in this case, was pistol cleanliness). The U that Mr. Tahmourpour received from Corporal Boyer on September 9, 1999 was the only U he had received in training up to that point. Thus, even if Mr. Tahmourpour's pistol was, in fact, dirty on September 28, 1999, Corporal Boyer's request for file review on September 30, 1999 was improper; at best, it would have been based on only 1 U for pistol cleanliness. Indeed, even if Mr. Tahmourpour's gun was dirty on September 28, 1999, Corporal Boyer could have given him an NI. He chose not to do this.\n[138] Given the direct and circumstantial evidence of Corporal Boyer's discriminatory attitude toward Mr. Tahmourpour, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. Tahmourpour's race, religion and\/or ethnic or national background was a factor in Corporal Boyer's assessment of the cleanliness of Mr. Tahmourpour's pistol on both September 9 and September 28, 1999.\n[139] On a balance of probabilities, I find, therefore, that Corporal Boyer's request for file review was improper and was based, at least in part, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(c) The October 8th Cadet Performance Feedback and The October 7th Termination Request\n[140] On October 7, 1999, Corporals Bradley and Jacques submitted a request for the termination of Mr. Tahmourpour's training contract based on their review of his file. The 2 U's that Mr. Tahmourpour received for pistol inspection triggered the review of his file which ultimately led to the request for the termination of Mr. Tahmourpour's contract. The request for termination was made one day prior to the completion of the one month deadline that Mr. Tahmourpour had been given to improve his performance in Applied Police Sciences.\n[141] In the Termination Request, Corporals Bradley and Jacques noted that Mr. Tahmourpour would be receiving an additional set of 5 U's in APS on the following day, on October 8th in a Cadet Performance Feedback Sheet. October 8th was the one month deadline for improvement in APS. Corporals Bradley and Jacques stated that in spite of obvious effort on Mr. Tahmourpour's part, he had shown no real improvement in the APS areas where he was deficient in September. Therefore, they stated that the termination request was not based on the two U's in Firearms alone. It was also based on the 5 U's that he was to receive in APS.\n[142] Mr. Tahmourpour disputed the entire contents of the Cadet Performance Feedback Sheet dated October 8, 1999, and the Termination Request dated October 7, 1999. He maintained that they were based on false evaluations, exaggerations and underestimations of his performance at Depot. The following are two examples of his allegations in that regard:\n(1) The Request for Termination states that Mr. Tahmourpour had difficulty in learning and applying the techniques in Police Defensive Tactics and that his skills in this area were weak. Mr. Tahmourpour said this was inaccurate. He asserted that the PDT instructor, Corporal Sloan, had told him that she was happy with his performance in PDT. He had failed his first test in PDT on August 25, 1999 for poor handcuffing technique (for which he received an NI), but improved and then passed the re-test with Corporal Brock, an instructor who was known for being tough but fair (the NI was replaced with a P on October 1, 1999).\n[143] The Request for Termination indicates that Corporal Sloan did not think that the PDT re-test was a good measure of Mr. Tahmourpour's abilities in PDT because it was not one of the most difficult tests. It dealt with combative behaviour which did not involve a great deal of decision-making.\n[144] Mr. Tahmourpour stated that he knew these views were not those of Corporal Sloan. During the meeting on October 7, 2008 to discuss the Request for Termination, he asked Corporals Jacques and Bradley if they would bring Corporal Sloan in to the meeting to clarify her views on his PDT skills and the re-test. His request was denied.\n[145] There was a significant difference between the wording of the Request for Termination dated October 7, 1999, and the Cadet Performance Feedback Sheet dated October 8, 1999. In the latter, Corporal Jacques stated that he observed the testing and felt that the test did not allow for the demonstration of enough skills to upgrade Mr. Tahmourpour's NI to a P. This would suggest that it was Corporal Jacques, not Corporal Sloan, who thought that the PDT re-test was not a good test of Mr. Tahmourpour's abilities.\n[146] Regardless of whether the PDT re-test was a good test of Mr. Tahmourpour's skills, by the time the termination request was made he did not have a single NI in PDT. Therefore, according to Mr. Tahmourpour, it was inaccurate and unfair to allege that he was weak in PDT. If he was weak, there should have been NI's on his record since an NI is to be assigned for performance that is even slightly deficient. If no formal feedback is provided, a cadet is entitled to assume that his or her performance is professional, according to the Cadet Assessment Procedures.\n(2) The Memorandum requesting termination of Mr. Tahmourpour's contract indicates that he was being given 5 U's in APS because he had not been able to show improvements in the areas discussed one month ago. Those areas related to communication, decision-making, planning and coordination, risk management and self-evaluation as demonstrated in scenarios, Physical Training, Applied Police Sciences, and Firearms.\n[147] Mr. Tahmourpour stated that, contrary to the October 8th Feedback Sheet and the Termination Request, he had demonstrated real improvements in these areas in the following ways:\nWhile he performed poorly in the first scenario involving a domestic disturbance on August 18, 1999, on September 30, 1999 Corporal Jacques noted that he had improved, although some mistakes were made. Mr. Tahmourpour was not given an NI for his performance in this scenario. Therefore, according to the Cadet Assessment Procedures, his performance in this scenario was deemed to be professional (P). That constituted an improvement from the August 18th domestic disturbance scenario. Mr. Tahmourpour testified that his second detachment visit on or about September 24, 1999 went very well. Detachment visits, which occur halfway through training, involve a visit to a mock RCMP Detachment unit where the cadets are called out to deal with situations, just as though they were on police duty at an RCMP Detachment anywhere in Canada. The Detachment scenarios require the cadets to integrate and apply many of the skills they have learned in the various units in training. The visit usually happens over a two day period. Mr. Tahmourpour's performance on the second day was monitored by Corporal Torsky. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that Corporal Torsky was exceptionally happy with his performance on the second day of the detachment visits. He was not given any feedback, which meant that his performance on this scenario was at the professional level. Mr. Tahmourpour performed very well on the Firearms Simulator Test. The simulator is a computerized system on a large screen television monitor that responds to the cadet's reactions. Mr. Tahmourpour was told that the simulator was quite difficult and that in fact, it was more difficult that any other scenario. He identified himself as a police officer and was able to defend himself against numerous simulated attackers. Corporal Jacques told Mr. Tahmourpour that he was quite impressed with Mr. Tahmourpour's performance on the firearms simulator. Mr. Tahmourpour performed well in instinctive shooting. Instinctive shooting is a technique where the individual looks at the target and without utilizing the sights of the pistol, fires at the target. It is very hard to acquire this skill and requires a lot of practice to master. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that the Request for Termination failed to take into account the fact that he had passed the Physical Abilities Requirement Evaluation (PARE) test on both test dates and that he had reduced his time in the PARE test by 35 seconds during the 24 weeks he spent at Depot.\n[148] Mr. Tahmourpour has established a prima facie case that his abilities in the program were not assessed fairly on the Cadet Performance Feedback Sheet and in the termination request. His accomplishments and improvements were minimized or not noted at all. His performance in PDT was not fairly assessed.\n[149] Dr. Wortley testified that systemic discrimination is often manifested in the underestimation or minimization of an individual's abilities. He hypothesized that systemic discrimination may be one of the reasons that the attrition rate for visible minority cadets at Depot was roughly twice as high as that of non-visible minority cadets during the time that Mr. Tahmourpour was in attendance there.\n[150] Dr. Wortley analyzed three sets of data provided by the RCMP with respect to attrition and failure rates at Depot. Attrition refers to early departures from the program for a number of reasons including failure, personal reasons and misconduct. The first set of data provided by the RCMP related to attrition rates for the period 1996-2000. Those statistics showed an attrition rate for non-visible minority cadets at Depot of 5.97% over the five year period. The average attrition for visible minorities is 13.35% over the five-year period in question. For 1999\/2000, the year that Mr. Tahmourpour's contract was terminated at Depot, the attrition rate for visible minorities was 16.98%, and for non-visible minorities it was 6.88%.\n[151] The second set of statistics for attrition rates for the period from 1996-2001 revealed a similar pattern. The attrition rate for visible minorities was 2.24 times higher than the attrition rate for non-visible minorities. Dr. Wortley stated that this was a statistically significant difference.\n[152] The third set of statistics presented the failure rates of cadets at Depot from 1998-2003. The failure rate is a subset of the attrition rate. Attrition rates cover cadets who have left the program for personal reasons, have been expelled for misconduct and who have failed. The third set of statistics revealed that the rate of failure among visible minority cadets in the training program (12.2%) was almost double that of the Caucasian candidates (6.5%). Furthermore, for the year that Mr. Tahmourpour was at Depot, the failure rate for visible minority cadets (19.6%) was almost three times that of the Caucasian cadets (7.0%). The same is true of 2000-2001.\n[153] I accept Dr. Wortley's testimony that despite some problems with the RCMP's means of obtaining and reporting these statistics, they constitute the best information available. I also accept his testimony that they reflect the actual number of cadets who were in the program, and are not a sample group. As a result, the problems regarding sample size that are associated with social science research are not an issue in this case. I find, therefore, that the statistics are reliable on a balance of probabilities.\n[154] On the basis of this evidence I find that during the year that Mr. Tahmourpour was in attendance at Depot, the attrition rate for visible minority cadets was 16.98%, and for non-visible minority cadets it was 6.88%. The failure rate was 19.6% for visible minorities and 7% for non-visible minorities.\n[155] Given the circumstantial evidence of differential attrition rates and discriminatory attitudes towards visible minority members and cadets, I think that it is a reasonable inference that the minimization or discounting of Mr. Tahmourpour's abilities in the October 8 Feedback and in the Request for Termination was based, at least in part, on his race, religion and\/or ethnic or national origin. Mr. Tahmourpour has, therefore, established a prima facie case with regard to this allegation.\nThe Respondent's Explanation\n[156] The RCMP denied the existence of systemic racism at Depot. It presented Dr. Garry Bell, an RCMP employee, as an expert witness to respond to the analysis of the data on attrition rates provided by Dr. Wortley. Dr. Bell was the Acting Officer in Charge of Cadet Training who agreed with the recommendation that Mr. Tahmourpour not be considered for re-enrollment at Depot. Given the closeness of his connection to one of the parties in the case, and to one of the questions being litigated, the Tribunal was of the view that the probative value of Dr. Bell's opinion evidence would be significantly outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Therefore, the Tribunal did not permit Dr. Bell to testify as an expert in this case.\n[157] The RCMP provided data indicating that the attrition rates for regular RCMP members for the period from 1997-2004 was significantly lower than that of the non-visible minority members. The RCMP also produced a statement from the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated May 16, 2007, indicating that the RCMP had demonstrated that it was fulfilling its obligations under the Employment Equity Act with regard to regular members. Those obligations require the RCMP to identify and remove employment barriers against women, Aboriginal people, members of visible minority groups and disabled persons.\n[158] The evidence provided by the Respondent with regard to the employment equity obligations and the attrition rates of regular members did not address the situation of cadets at Depot. It applied exclusively to individuals who are employed by the RCMP. Cadets at Depot are not yet employed by the RCMP. They are not paid to attend the Academy and they are not considered to be employees. Therefore, I find that the RCMP did not provide evidence to counter the evidence presented by Mr. Tahmourpour with regard to the attrition rates at Depot.\n[159] The RCMP contended that Mr. Tahmourpour's race, religion and\/or national or ethnic origin had absolutely nothing to do with his dismissal. He was simply unable to demonstrate the required skills by that point in training and showed no likelihood that he would be able to do so in the future. The RCMP denied that Mr. Tahmourpour was unfairly evaluated.\n[160] Corporal Bradley stated that while Mr. Tahmourpour may have passed the re-test in PDT with Corporal Brock, the scenario in the re-test did not provide an opportunity to test the areas where Mr. Tahmourpour had been identified in APS as having been weak: communication skills, decision-making, risk-assessment, and self-evaluation. That explanation may explain why one day after the interview in which Mr. Tahmourpour disputed that Corporal Sloan had said he was weak in PDT, the Feedback Document dated October 8, 1999 indicated that Corporal Jacques did not think the re-test was a good measure of Mr. Tahmourpour's APS-related performance.\n[161] However, the RCMP's explanation does not explain why Mr. Tahmourpour was reported as being weak in PDT. Corporal Bradley admitted that Corporal Brock, who conducted the second PDT test and removed Mr. Tahmourpour's NI in this area, was an extremely competent PDT instructor and that his evaluation of Mr. Tahmourpour's ability in PDT could not be second-guessed. Mr. Tahmourpour did not receive any NI's in PDT other than for the first test which he then cleared with Corporal Brock. Therefore, his PDT skills should have been considered professional and not the subject of comment in the Termination Request. If Mr. Tahmourpour had not been put on notice, through the issuance of formal NI's in PDT, that his performance was deficient enough to count towards the termination of his contract, he was entitled to assume that his performance in PDT was professional.\n[162] It is significant that Corporal Sloan, who allegedly made the negative comments about Mr. Tahmourpour's performance in PDT, was not called as a witness by the RCMP.\n[163] I find that the RCMP did not provide a satisfactory explanation with regard to the negative assessment and portrayal of Mr. Tahmourpour's performance in PDT.\n[164] Corporal Bradley gave very convincing testimony about the difficulties that Mr. Tahmourpour was having with respect to communication skills and self-evaluation in APS. During Mr. Tahmourpour's testimony, I observed some of the same weaknesses. For example, Mr. Tahmourpour's ability to self-assess seemed to me to be weak. He asserted that, like all cadets, he had weaknesses. Yet, when asked what those weaknesses were he was unable to respond. As has already been noted, Mr. Tahmourpour's idea of active listening was taking good notes. I also noted that Mr. Tahmourpour was often evasive in his responses to questions put to him by his own counsel and by counsel for the Respondent in cross-examination. His responses particularly to the questions about his activities after he left Depot were unclear, contradictory and hard to follow.\n[165] I also note the testimony of Mr. Tahmourpour's three fellow troop mates that his skills in many areas were so weak that they would be afraid to work with him in the field. There was credible evidence that Mr. Tahmourpour had difficulty performing competently in scenarios, and that this was largely a function of his inability to listen to people, to integrate the information he received and to formulate an appropriate course of action based on that information.\n[166] However, I am troubled by the fact that evaluations of arguably legitimate weaknesses in Mr. Tahmourpour's performance at Depot were included among evaluations, such as the PDT evaluation, the pistol cleanliness evaluation and the pepper spray evaluation, that were improper or that discounted his abilities.\n[167] Moreover, the Cadet Performance Review that was provided a month (or so) after the September 8th evaluation indicated that Mr. Tahmourpour had made no real progress. On that basis he was given the 5 U's that formed part of the termination request. Yet, the RCMP witnesses agreed that Mr. Tahmourpour had improved his PARE time, and had performed well in instinctive shooting and in the Firearms Simulator test. Corporal Jacques stated that Mr. Tahmourpour had performed to a professional standard on the second day of the detachment visit and that he had shown sufficient improvement in the domestic disturbance scenario that no formal feedback had been issued. Yet, these improvements or positive performances are not noted in the one month Cadet Performance review.\n[168] Any positive achievements that are noted in the Assessment are discounted. Mr. Tahmourpour passed his PDT test, but the test was not a good measure of his abilities in APS. He passed his APS exam, but he could not apply the knowledge that he had demonstrated in the exam. While this may be true, the lack of inclusion of his success in the above-mentioned areas conveys a distinctly different picture of Mr. Tahmourpour than had they been included.\n[169] Corporal H\u00e9bert stated that in a Request for Termination, it is assumed that those areas that are not discussed are professional; only the problematic areas are presented. I accept this explanation as far as the request for termination is concerned, but with respect to the one-month follow-up assessment, I was not given a satisfactory explanation as to why Mr. Tahmourpour's improvements were not noted. Furthermore, I was not given a satisfactory explanation as to why the facilitators did not wait until they had completed the one-month follow-up assessment before they requested Mr. Tahmourpour's termination.\n[170] When asked whether improvement in PDT, and in the second day of the detachment visit, and the absence of an NI in the second domestic disturbance scenario constituted improvement, Corporal Bradley simply maintained that Mr. Tahmourpour was not showing improvement. Clearly, that was not the case. The improvements may not have been sufficient for Corporals Bradley and Jacques to change their opinions of Mr. Tahmourpour's suitability for police work. However, their failure to provide a balanced account of Mr. Tahmourpour's performance up to that point in training, as well as their inclusion of inaccurate assessments, strongly suggests that there was another factor influencing their assessment of Mr. Tahmourpour's file. The RCMP has not rebutted the prima facie case raised by Mr. Tahmourpour that his race, religion and\/or ethnic or national origin were a factor in the assessment of his file and the request for termination of his training contract.\n[171] I accept Corporal Bradley's testimony that she had real concerns about Mr. Tahmourpour's communication skills, judgment and ability to solve problems. She did not think that he would be able to do police work because of these deficiencies. The problem with this explanation, however, is that in a training environment where derogatory comments about race are condoned and directed at people like Mr. Tahmourpour, where evaluations are inaccurate and improper, and where instructors take pride in being politically incorrect, it is difficult for someone like Mr. Tahmourpour to develop and demonstrate his skills in these areas. I find it reasonable to infer that such conditions erode one's confidence and ability to perform well. Therefore, the Respondent's explanation that Mr. Tahmourpour's performance at Depot was weak is not satisfactory. Mr. Tahmourpour's performance was more likely than not affected by the discrimination to which he was exposed.\nC. The Decision to Terminate Mr. Tahmourpour's Contract [172] On October 20, 1999, the Commanding Officer of Depot, Chief Superintendent Lynn Twardosky terminated Mr. Tahmourpour's training contract. The decision was based on the recommendation made to the Commanding Officer by Corporals Bradley and Jacques. In her written decision, the Commanding Officer stated that she concurred with Corporals Bradley and Jacques' decision to terminate Mr. Tahmourpour's contract.\n[173] The recommendation and decision to terminate Mr. Tahmourpour's contract were based on discriminatory assessments of Mr. Tahmourpour's skills. In addition, they were based on his performance in a program where he was not given an equal opportunity like other cadets, to develop and demonstrate his abilities and skills at Depot. Therefore, I find that discrimination on the basis of a prohibited ground was a factor in the termination of Mr. Tahmourpour's training contract.\nD. The Assessment of Mr. Tahmourpour's Suitability for Re-enrollment [174] Mr. Tahmourpour was told that it was not uncommon for cadets to fail the training program and then be re-admitted by the RCMP at a later point in time. When his contract was terminated, Mr. Tahmourpour hoped that this would be the case for him. However, to his surprise, he discovered that a memorandum had been placed on his file, dated December 23, 1999, indicating that he was to be given no consideration by the Recruiting Division for re-enrollment.\n[175] The author of the memorandum was Sergeant Champigny, the Career Manager at Depot at the time. Sergeant Champigny did not testify. However, in the Memorandum he stated that during the termination process, Mr. Tahmourpour demonstrated physical symptoms that appeared to be related to stress. He reported that on two separate occasions, Mr. Tahmourpour's troop mates escorted him to the Medical Treatment Centre because he was vomiting, shaking, hyperventilating and was incoherent. Sergeant Champigny reported that Corporals Bradley and Jacques consulted with the F Division staff psychologist (no name given) who described Mr. Tahmourpour's behaviour as passive suicidal ideation. Sergeant Champigny reported that a follow-up discussion with Dr. Roy, another staff psychologist, revealed that Dr. Roy had concerns about Mr. Tahmourpour's ability to handle difficult and challenging situations. Dr. Roy would not recommend Mr. Tahmourpour for re-engagement.\n[176] Mr. Tahmourpour stated that he went to the Medical Treatment Centre on only one occasion on October 15, 1999, for treatment of vomiting, hyperventilation and shaking. He stated, however, that he did not meet with a psychologist or a doctor. He denied that suicide had ever entered his thoughts. He was sick, exhausted and upset about the discrimination he had experienced at Depot and the termination of his training contract.\n[177] After Mr. Tahmourpour left Depot, he sent a letter to the troop via Corporals Bradley and Jacques in which he expressed his hope that he and his troop mates would be reunited at some point in the future. Corporal Bradley and Corporal Jacques found this to be very odd. They were concerned that he had not accepted the reality of his termination. Corporal Jacques provided a copy of Mr. Tahmourpour's letter to Dr. Roy and suggested that he let the people in staffing know what his opinion was of Mr. Tahmourpour's mental state.\n[178] Mr. Tahmourpour has established a prima facie case that he was treated differently from other cadets who had not successfully completed their training. He was denied the opportunity to re-enroll at Depot on the basis of a medical opinion that appears to have been given without ever having met him. Moreover, the evidence strongly suggests, on a prima facie basis, that Mr. Tahmourpour's facilitators were instrumental in ensuring that he would not be permitted to re-enroll at Depot. Given the foregoing evidence of the discriminatory treatment of Mr. Tahmourpour and the systemic discrimination at Depot, I find that there is a prima facie case that the denial of an opportunity to re-enroll was based, at least in part, on Mr. Tahmourpour's race, religion and\/or ethnic or national background.\nThe Respondent's Explanation\n[179] The RCMP alleged that Mr. Tahmourpour became mentally unstable after he was given the news on October 7, 1999 that a request had been made to terminate his training contract. Staff psychologists provided their opinions that Mr. Tahmourpour should not be considered for re-enrollment given his evident inability to deal with stress and challenges.\n[180] Corporals Droudy and Mangat testified that Mr. Tahmourpour began behaving very strangely after he received the news that his contract was being terminated. He left Depot for long periods of time without a jacket, slept a lot on the weekend and appeared unkempt and disheveled. They reported this behaviour to Corporal Jacques. Corporal Jacques stated that he and Corporal Bradley contacted Dr. Yaholnitsky-Smith, an RCMP staff psychologist for F Division, who advised them that Mr. Tahmourpour might be suffering from passive suicidal ideation. Corporal Jacques was not sure that Mr. Tahmourpour had met with Dr. Yaholnitsky-Smith, but he thought that he had met with the doctor, Dr. Dufour. Neither Dr. Dufour, nor Dr. Yaholnitsky-Smith testified. There were no medical records to confirm that Mr. Tahmourpour met with either of these two doctors.\n[181] The Memorandum from Sergeant Champigny does not say that Mr. Tahmourpour met with Dr. Yaholnitsky-Smith, or that she provided a formal diagnosis. It simply states that the troop facilitators consulted with the F Division psychologist who described the behaviour as passive suicidal ideation.\n[182] The staff psychologist at Depot, Dr. Robert Roy, testified. He was hampered by the fact that he did not have Mr. Tahmourpour's medical file; it was destroyed pursuant to an RCMP policy regarding the retention of records. Dr. Roy had almost no independent recollection of the events in this case. He based his testimony on what he thought must have happened.\n[183] Dr. Roy could not recall meeting with Mr. Tahmourpour. He admitted that at the time that Mr. Tahmourpour was leaving Depot, he was probably on holiday. Yet, Dr. Roy thought that he must have met with Mr. Tahmourpour, however briefly, because Sergeant Champigny referred to an opinion he had provided about Mr. Tahmourpour. Dr. Roy stated that if he had met with Mr. Tahmourpour, he would have made a very qualified statement about his mental stability. He would not have provided a firm diagnosis because he was sure that he had not met with him at length. Dr. Roy would have recommended that Mr. Tahmourpour have a full psychological work-up before being considered for re-enrollment.\n[184] The Memorandum about Mr. Tahmourpour does not recommend a full psychological assessment prior to considering Mr. Tahmourpour for re-enrollment. That would have been the reasonable approach to dealing with the RCMP's concerns about Mr. Tahmourpour's reaction to disappointment and challenge. Instead, the recommendation to deny Mr. Tahmourpour consideration for re-enrollment was unconditional, and was based on cursory psychological examinations, if any.\n[185] The RCMP has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation that discrimination on the basis of a prohibited ground was not a factor in the recommendation and consequent decision to refuse Mr. Tahmourpour re-enrollment at the Academy.\nV. WHAT MUST BE PROVEN WITH REGARD TO SECTION 14 OF THE ACT? [186] It is a discriminatory practice, under s. 14 of the Act, to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination in matters related to employment. Harassment, as proscribed under the Act, has been broadly defined as repetitive and unwelcome conduct related to one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims (Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd. [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at 1284; Rampersadsingh v. Wignall (No. 2) (2002), 45 C.H.R.R. D\/237 at para. 40 (C.H.R.T.); and Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) (re Franke) [1999] 3 F.C. 653 (T.D.) at paras 43 and 45).\nA. Was Mr. Tahmourpour a victim of harassment on the basis of a prohibited ground? [187] Mr. Tahmourpour alleged that Corporal Boyer's conduct constituted harassment on the basis of his race, religion and\/or ethnic or national origin. He stated that Corporal Boyer repeatedly screamed in his ear on the Firing Range that he was a loser, a coward and incompetent. Mr. Tahmourpour told Corporal Boyer that his conduct was upsetting him, and yet, Corporal Boyer persisted. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that Corporal Boyer's constant verbal abuse of him negatively affected his self-confidence and his performance at Depot. Sergeant Brar testified that he observed Corporal Boyer to exhibit this kind of behaviour towards female and visible minority cadets.\n[188] Mr. Tahmourpour alleged that Corporals Bradley and Jacques also subjected him to harassment on the basis of a prohibited ground. He stated that Corporals Bradley and Jacques regularly removed him from class to ridicule and criticize him for his personal traits, including his soft-spoken voice, his tendencies to sit back in class and to take too many notes.\n[189] Mr. Tahmourpour stated that Corporals Bradley and Jacques met with him on a daily basis during the lunch period thereby preventing him from marching with his troop to the dining hall for lunch. As a result, he stated that he missed lunch almost every day, especially towards the end of training, and sometimes would even miss another meal during the day to speak with Corporals Jacques and Bradley. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that he was too embarrassed to enter the dining hall alone after his meetings with Corporals Bradley and Jacques; all the cadets would suspect that there was something wrong if he did this. So, he regularly missed meals.\n[190] The different treatment that Mr. Tahmourpour received from Corporals Jacques and Bradley was exhibited publicly, according to Mr. Tahmourpour. He stated that prior to being shown a video about two officers who were killed in action, Corporal Bradley described one of the deceased officers as similar to Mr. Tahmourpour in his soft-spoken manner. She stated that this perceived weakness had contributed to the officer's death and suggested that this kind of officer would be a danger to himself and to other officers.\n[191] Mr. Tahmourpour stated that on September 10, 1999, he met with Corporals Jacques and Bradley to discuss a performance feedback evaluation. He described the meeting as extremely antagonistic. For over an hour Corporals Bradley and Jacques yelled at him in an abusive and hostile manner, at times standing directly in front of his face. Mr. Tahmourpour testified that during the meeting of September 10, 1999, Corporal Bradley stated that she could not understand his English.\n[192] Mr. Tahmourpour established a prima facie case that he was subjected to harassment on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination by Corporals Bradley, Jacques and Boyer. It should be noted that Mr. Tahmourpour also adduced the transcript of an audio-taped telephone conversation that he had with one of his troop mates, Constable Rob Lasson, about Mr. Tahmourpour's experiences at Depot. At its best, the transcript could be said to lend some support to Mr. Tahmourpour's case that his instructors were particularly hard on him. However, it consisted of self-serving and hearsay evidence that was not tested through cross-examination. I accorded it very little weight as a result.\nThe Respondent's Explanation\n[193] Corporal Boyer denied that he verbally harassed Mr. Tahmourpour. However, based on the evidence that I have reviewed in these reasons, I find that Corporal Boyer harassed Mr. Tahmourpour on the basis of his race, religion and\/or ethnic or national origin. Corporal Boyer asked Mr. Tahmourpour what kind of fucking language is that or did you make it up? when Mr. Tahmourpour signed a feedback form early in training. He went on to berate Mr. Tahmourpour regularly and publicly for his poor performance in Firearms. Corporal Boyer also told Mr. Tahmourpour get the fuck out of my face or I'll kick your ass when Mr. Tahmourpour asked for a second opinion about the cleanliness of his pistol.\n[194] Mr. Tahmourpour's evidence of verbal harassment on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination was corroborated by that of Sergeant Brar and Constable McCarney. While Corporal Boyer was generally loud and aggressive with all cadets, he was significantly more so with Mr. Tahmourpour and other visible minorities. I have found this differential treatment to be based on a prohibited ground. Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that Corporal Boyer harassed Mr. Tahmourpour on the basis of a prohibited ground contrary to s. 14 of the Act.\n[195] Corporal Bradley denied that she removed Mr. Tahmourpour from class or kept him back from lunch on a daily basis. She stated that the only meetings that occurred with Mr. Tahmourpour were during the issuing of formal feedback.\n[196] Corporal Bradley stated that the tone of the meetings was professional and sensitive. She denied that she screamed at Mr. Tahmourpour or that she told him that she did not understand his English. She also denied that she referred to Mr. Tahmourpour when she was introducing the session about the two constables who were killed on duty.\n[197] Corporal Bradley stated that the procedure for each of the feedback meetings was standard. The Feedback Sheet would be reviewed. The deficiency was linked to a particular skill area or competency. The cadet would be asked for his or her comments and input. An action plan would be formulated to deal with the identified deficiencies taking into account the suggestions made by the cadet.\n[198] Corporal Bradley stated that she provided verbal feedback to Mr. Tahmourpour during classes but that it was done in a constructive way. That is, she would tell him what he had done well and what he could do to improve. She denied repeatedly telling Mr. Tahmourpour that he should not be sitting back and taking notes. She did not have a problem with this behaviour; rather she told Mr. Tahmourpour that he needed to participate more effectively during training.\n[199] Corporal Bradley provided her testimony on this point in a forthright and convincing manner. She struck me as a direct, well-spoken individual who would not mince words, but who would express herself in a professional manner. Therefore, I accept her testimony that she did not pull Mr. Tahmourpour out of class every day to berate him about his performance.\n[200] Corporal Jacques stated that he may have met with Mr. Tahmourpour more frequently than Corporal Bradley, but that he did not meet with Mr. Tahmourpour on a daily basis, nor did he pull him out of class or hold him back from his meals on a daily basis. It is plausible that Corporal Jacques would have met with Mr. Tahmourpour more frequently than Corporal Bradley since he was Mr. Tahmourpour's instructor in both Firearms and APS.\n[201] Like the testimony of Corporal Bradley on this point, I found Corporal Jacques' testimony with regard to the tenor and frequency of his meetings with Mr. Tahmourpour to be convincing. Although I concluded earlier that Corporals Bradley and Jacques facilitated and furthered Corporal Boyer's initiative to eliminate Mr. Tahmourpour from the training program, the additional and distinct allegation of aggressive and coercive behaviour stands in stark contrast to the overall evidence of the conduct and comportment of Corporals Bradley and Jacques. Constable McCarney, for example, whose testimony I found to be very forthright and frank, testified that out of the numerous courses he has taken with the RCMP, he has yet to experience instructors who are as patient and professional as Corporals Jacques and Bradley.\n[202] In contrast, I found Mr. Tahmourpour's testimony regarding the frequency and tenor of the meeting he had with Corporals Bradley and Jacques to be less credible. Mr. Tahmourpour stated that he was pulled out of class or kept late by Corporals Bradley and Jacques almost every day during training. Towards the end of his training period, the frequency of these meetings increased to several times a day. As a result, he missed meals on a daily basis. In spite of missing so many meals, Mr. Tahmourpour testified that he was able to gain 9 pounds and reduce his PARE time by 35 seconds. He achieved this on a diet of cookies and ready-to-go food from Wal-Mart. I found Mr. Tahmourpour's testimony on this point implausible.\n[203] Mr. Tahmourpour may have felt that he was receiving more verbal and formal feedback than his troop mates. However, on a balance of probabilities I find that he did not meet with his troop facilitators with anywhere near the degree of frequency that he reported. Moreover, I find it improbable that he was subjected to verbal abuse when he did meet with them.\n[204] Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Tahmourpour was not subjected to harassment on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination from Corporals Bradley and Jacques while at Depot.\nVI. WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY IN THE PRESENT CASE? [205] The Tribunal derives its remedial jurisdiction from s. 53 of the Act. The remedies contemplated therein are designed to stop the discrimination that is occurring from continuing, to prevent future discrimination from occurring, and to compensate individual victims for past or ongoing discriminatory practices.\n(i) Compensation for Discriminatory Conduct\n[206] The goal of the remedial provisions is to provide complainants with compensation for the losses caused by the discriminatory conduct (Canada (Attorney-General) v. McAlpine (1989), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/253 at para. 13 (F.C.A.)). Therefore, to establish entitlement to a remedy, the complainant must show some causal connection between the discriminatory act and the loss claimed (Canada (Attorney General) v. Morgan (1991), 85 D.L.R. (4th) 473 (F.C.A.)). Until recently, the Court of Appeal's decision in Morgan stood for the proposition that to establish a causal connection, the complainant must prove only that there is a serious possibility that the respondent's discriminatory act caused the damage for which the complainant claims compensation ((Chopra v. National Health and Welfare 2004 CHRT 27; aff'd: 2007 FCA 269; Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba [1995] 2 F.C. 569 (F.C.T.D.); Canada (Attorney General) v. Green [2000] 4 F.C. 629 at para 142 (F.C.T.D.); and Culic v. Canada Post 2007 CHRT 01). However, in its 2007 decision in Chopra, the Federal Court of Appeal has suggested that there was no consensus on the serious possibility test among the three justices who decided Morgan. Therefore, that test may be subject to some question. Nonetheless, I am bound by decisions such as Green wherein the Trial Division stated that the serious possibility test is the means of determining whether there is a causal connection between the discriminatory conduct and the loss.\n[207] So long as there is a serious possibility that the respondent's conduct caused the damage for which compensation is being claimed, any uncertainty with regard to the probability that the conduct caused the damage must be factored into the assessment of the quantum of damages (Green, supra, at para 142).\n[208] The case law makes a distinction between situations where the discrimination has caused a direct loss or denial of employment for which instatement or reinstatement is an appropriate remedy, and situations where the discrimination has caused the complainant to lose an employment or training opportunity. In the latter situation, Tribunals have held that the appropriate remedy is to require the respondent to provide the lost or denied opportunity, with or without financial compensation. (See for example: Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Greyhound Lines of Canada (1987), 8 C.H.R.R. D\/4184 (F.C.A.); Chapdelaine v. Air Canada (1991), 15 C.H.R.R. D\/22 (Can. Rev. Trib.) at para. 19-32; Bitonti v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia 2002 BCHRT 29 at para. 33; and Chopra v. Department of National Health and Welfare 2004 CHRT 27; aff'd: 2007 FCA 269).\n[209] Recently, the Federal Court of Appeal has approved the distinction between lost employment opportunity and direct loss of employment in the assessment of remedy. In Chopra, the Tribunal concluded that a mere but serious possibility existed that Dr. Chopra would have won the employment competition but for the discriminatory practice. However, in attempting to quantify the likelihood that Dr. Chopra would have won the employment competition, it found that there was only a 33 1\/3 percent chance that he would have won the competition. Therefore, rather than ordering instatement in the position, the Tribunal ordered compensation in the form of wages for the lost opportunity. The Tribunal reduced the compensation by two thirds to reflect the relatively high uncertainty that Dr. Chopra would have been successful in the competition. On appeal, Dr. Chopra argued that having found that there was a serious possibility that he would have won the competition, the Tribunal was required to order instatement in that position. The Court disagreed. It held that Dr. Chopra had been compensated for what he lost, the opportunity to compete for the Indeterminate position on a non-discriminatory basis. Having been compensated for the loss of the ability to compete on a fair basis, it would be double compensation to then award him the position itself.\n[210] In the present case, the RCMP's discriminatory conduct caused Mr. Tahmourpour to lose the opportunity to develop and demonstrate, to his full potential, the necessary skills to become an RCMP officer. I find that there is a serious possibility that had the discrimination not occurred, Mr. Tahmourpour would have successfully completed the training at Depot. Indeed, the failure rate for non-visible minority cadets was only 6.88% (the attrition rate was 7%) for 1999, indicating that when discrimination was not a factor, the vast majority of cadets successfully completed the program. On that basis, I find that one of the appropriate remedies in this case is an order that Mr. Tahmourpour be given the opportunity to re-enroll in the next available training program at Depot. The parties may also agree to a different date for re-enrollment that is mutually convenient.\n[211] The order that Mr. Tahmourpour be offered re-enrollment in the Cadet Training Program is not to be interpreted as a requirement that he pass the Cadet Training Program. Mr. Tahmourpour must complete the training required of him, and achieve a professional rating in all of the required competencies and skills, in the same manner as all cadets who undertake the Cadet Training Program. If Mr. Tahmourpour completes the Training Program, he is to be treated in the same manner as all successful cadets.\n[212] Mr. Tahmourpour requested an order that he be immediately instated as a regular RCMP officer at a level commensurate with the members who attended the training Academy at the same time as he did. For the following reasons, I find that this remedy is not appropriate.\n[213] Firstly, Mr. Tahmourpour has not completed the RCMP training program. He missed 8 weeks of an intense 32 week program which, according to the evidence, are even more rigorous in terms of the skills that are developed and knowledge that is acquired than the preceding weeks. It is clear, then, that Mr. Tahmourpour has not acquired all of the skills that are necessary to be a police officer. It would be imprudent, to say the least, to order that the RCMP accept as a regular member, someone who does not yet possess the skills to be a police officer.\n[214] Secondly, Mr. Tahmourpour has not passed the required test for shooting accuracy which is a requirement for all RCMP officers before they are permitted to carry a weapon. Sergeant Brar testified that while there are administrative duties in the RCMP that do not involve the use of a firearm, any officer whether on administrative duties or not, may be called out during a crisis for active duty involving use of a firearm. For that reason, all officers, regardless of their position, must qualify every year in firearms use. Mr. Tahmourpour has not yet demonstrated that he is capable of passing that test.\n[215] Thirdly, those skills that Mr. Tahmourpour successfully acquired during the fourteen weeks he spent in training may have deteriorated over the past 8 years. He may be in need of a refresher.\n[216] Finally, I have found that the discriminatory treatment prevented Mr. Tahmourpour from demonstrating the knowledge and skills required to be a police officer. It has not yet been determined whether, in a non-discriminatory environment, he can demonstrate those skills and knowledge. That must be determined before he is engaged as an RCMP officer.\n[217] This does not, however, necessarily mean that Mr. Tahmourpour must repeat the entire training program. The evidence established that when cadets are unsuccessful at their first attempt at training and are re-enrolled, an assessment is done of their skills to determine the areas in which further training is needed and where no further training is needed. The same should be done for Mr. Tahmourpour.\nShould compensation for lost wages be provided to Mr. Tahmourpour for the loss of the opportunity to complete training that was caused by the RCMP's discriminatory conduct?\n[218] Yes. The RCMP's discriminatory conduct denied Mr. Tahmourpour the opportunity to complete training and to make his living as an RCMP officer. He must be compensated for the loss of wages that he would have earned.\nHow is the compensation for the wage loss resulting from the denial of the opportunity to be calculated?\n[219] The Tribunal's approach in Chopra of providing compensation for wage loss, discounting for any uncertainty in obtaining the position, was found by the Court of Appeal to be an acceptable way of compensating for lost opportunity (Chopra, at para. 43). I shall follow suit.\n[220] The evidence indicated that non-visible minority cadets had a 93% chance of completing training. I find it appropriate to use this figure for determining the likelihood of Mr. Tahmourpour's completion of the program because, based on the evidence that I heard and the conclusions that I have drawn about Mr. Tahmourpour's performance in the program, it is reasonable to infer that had the discriminatory conditions not been present Mr. Tahmourpour would have had the same chance as a non-visible minority candidate to successfully complete the training. I am mindful of the following potential concerns with this inference: first, Mr. Tahmourpour demonstrated weaknesses in the program that may not have been related to the discriminatory conduct, and which may have reduced his chances of success from 93% to something less. However, there is no way of knowing whether these weaknesses would have appeared and to what extent they would have influenced Mr. Tahmourpour's chances of success had he not been subjected to discriminatory treatment; any estimate of their influence would be speculative to the point of arbitrariness. It would not be fair to discount Mr. Tahmourpour's compensation on such a highly speculative basis.\n[221] Secondly, I have not used the attrition and failure rate of visible minority candidates because, on the basis of Dr. Wortley's evidence, I find it more probable than not that at least one of the factors in the higher attrition rate for visible minorities than for non-visible minority cadets is discrimination. It would be inappropriate to discount Mr. Tahmourpour's chances of success on the basis of a figure that took into account discriminatory actions.\n[222] Therefore, I find that the compensation for wage loss must first be reduced by 7% to reflect the possibility that Mr. Tahmourpour might not have completed the program due to reasons that have nothing to do with discrimination. The evidence indicated that the average rate of attrition for regular members during the first 20 years of their employment is 1%. The Respondent provided no statistical evidence with regard to the attrition rates in Field Training.\n[223] On the basis of these statistics, I find that Mr. Tahmourpour's compensation for the wage loss he sustained as a result of the discriminatory practice should be discounted by 8% to reflect the attrition rate both at Depot and in the Regular Force.\nFor what time period should Mr. Tahmourpour be compensated?\n[224] Mr. Tahmourpour claimed that he should be paid wages and benefits lost on a retroactive basis for the entire period from 1999 until instatement as an RCMP officer or, in the alternative, until the date of this decision with a further order for future wage loss in the event that instatement is not ordered.\n[225] Dealing first with the claim for retroactive wage and benefit loss, in Chopra, the Court of Appeal stated that in exercising its discretion under s. 53(2)(c) to award compensation for any or all of the wages lost as a result of the discriminatory practice, the Tribunal may well find that the principles underlying the doctrine of mitigation of losses in other contexts apply. Society has an interest in promoting economic efficiency by requiring those who have suffered a loss to take steps to minimize that loss as it is not in the public interest to allow some members of society to maximize their loss at the expense of others, even if those others are the authors of the loss. Thus while a tribunal is not bound to apply the doctrine of mitigation, it is not prohibited from doing so in the exercise of its discretion to determine the amounts payable to a complainant.\n[226] I find that it is appropriate to consider in this case whether Mr. Tahmourpour took steps to minimize his losses. Mr. Tahmourpour's evidence on this issue was weak. He stated that when he left Depot in October of 1999, he was upset, but not depressed. He moved to Toronto to seek work. However, when he arrived in Toronto he found that he was unable to work because he was experiencing insomnia and was unable to concentrate. Mr. Tahmourpour saw a doctor who prescribed medication for his sleep difficulty. He did not take the medication because it was too expensive. He obtained Social Assistance benefits on the basis of his doctor's report that he was unable to work. Social Assistance pays for drug expenses. Later in his testimony he stated that he took the medication when he had the money to purchase it.\n[227] Mr. Tahmourpour began taking courses to become a real estate agent in June of 2002. At that time, he had a doctor's note stating that he was unable to attend school or work because he was too ill. He stated that although his doctor thought he could not do this, he thought he could.\n[228] Mr. Tahmourpour became a licensed real estate agent in 2003. He stated that he was a poor real estate agent; he sold only one property and received a commission of $5,000 for this.\n[229] Mr. Tahmourpour took courses with the hope of becoming an interpreter and translator in the Persian language. He was certified by the Federal Government, the province of Ontario, and city of Toronto as a Persian interpreter. He paid $600 to become an interpreter. However, he was only able to earn $100 as a translator.\n[230] Mr. Tahmourpour stated that pursuing his human rights complaint has required almost full time effort. No employer would ever tolerate that much time away. Therefore, he could not work from the time he filed his complaint in 2001, until the present.\n[231] I find that Mr. Tahmourpour has not made sufficient efforts to minimize his losses from the time he left Depot until the commencement of the hearing in August 2007. I accept that from 2000-2002, it was difficult for him to work as a result of the psychological impact of his experiences at Depot. The fact that he did not take the medication prescribed to him by his physician for his difficulties troubles me, but I accept that he may not have been thinking clearly during this two year period.\n[232] However, in June of 2002, he felt well enough to embark on Real Estate courses notwithstanding the opinion of his physician that he could not work or go to school. By 2003, he was licensed to sell Real Estate and attempted to do so. Although he became a trained translator, he earned only $100 for his services during this time. I am not convinced that Mr. Tahmourpour put real effort into pursuing gainful employment that would have minimized his losses. Indeed, he stated that he could not do so because his human rights complaint took all of his time.\n[233] I do not accept that working on his human rights complaint required Mr. Tahmourpour's full-time effort. I accept that it took some time and that his case was more arduous than most because it reached the Federal Court of Appeal and involved two investigations by the Commission. He was self-represented in some of the legal proceedings. However, it would appear that, for at least some of the time since 2000, Mr. Tahmourpour has been assisted by legal counsel since there are letters written to the RCMP by his counsel dated May 4, 2000 on the record. Therefore, I find it unreasonable that Mr. Tahmourpour was unable to work at all (other than to sell one property and perform one translation assignment) from January 2002 to the present time.\n[234] Based on my knowledge of the time involved in complaints of this nature, the following represents a reasonable amount of time for a layperson such as Mr. Tahmourpour to spend on the tasks involved in this complaint:\nDrafting the complaint, cooperating with the Commission to provide information for the investigation, responding to the Commission's documentation and doing additional research to support the complaint - 60 hours;\nPreparing for and presenting the judicial review of the Commission's decision to the Federal Court Trial Division - 120 hours;\nWorking with counsel on the appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal - 60 hours;\nParticipating in the second investigation before the Canadian Human Rights Commission - 40 hours;\nParticipating in the Tribunal process and preparing for the hearing - 200 hours.\n[235] By my calculation, the total amounts to 480 hours, or 12 weeks of work at 40 hours per week.\n[236] The RCMP shall pay Mr. Tahmourpour the full-time wages and benefits that he would have received for two years from January 2000 (if that is, in fact, the date when Troop 4 cadets began work as RCMP officers; if not, the appropriate date may be substituted). In addition, the RCMP must pay Mr. Tahmourpour the wages and salary that he would have received for an additional 480 hours of work. Those wages and benefits should be calculated on the basis of the average wage and salary from 2000 to August 2007, for regular members who graduated from Depot at the end of 1999. Mr. Tahmourpour may have an obligation to repay the money he received in Social Assistance benefits during this time.\n[237] Taking into account the period during which Mr. Tahmourpour could not work for health and complaint-related reasons, I find that Mr. Tahmourpour could have been gainfully employed until the present time. I do not accept that working on his human rights complaint precluded full-time employment from the time that he was well enough to work until the commencement of the hearing in August of 2007. People make all sorts of arrangements and accommodations to pursue important activities outside of full-time employment. Mr. Tahmourpour could have done so too.\n[238] The RCMP should be required to pay only the difference between what Mr. Tahmourpour would have earned at a full-time job and what he would have earned as an RCMP officer from the date upon which the grace period for health and complaint-related time ends until the date of this decision. The RCMP is therefore, ordered to pay the difference between the average full-time industrial wage in Canada for persons of his age, and the salary that he would have received as an RCMP officer for this time period.\n[239] The evidence indicated that Mr. Tahmourpour would likely have been promoted to Corporal after seven years working as a Constable. The compensation paid to Mr. Tahmourpour must reflect that change in rank.\n[240] The salary rates for the relevant time periods were entered into evidence at the hearing and filed as Exhibits C-1, Tabs 88 and 89. Those are the rates that are to be used in calculating the compensation unless the parties agree otherwise.\n[241] The evidence on the issue of over-time pay was not clear. Constable McCarney testified that regular duty constables usually make overtime pay. He was not sure how much that was. It depended upon the work given to the constable. I find that had he been employed during the period from January 2000 to the date of this decision, Mr. Tahmourpour would have received some overtime. Therefore, I order that Mr. Tahmourpour be paid the average amount of overtime pay given to other constables who graduated from Depot in 1999.\nShould there be an order for future wage loss?\n[242] There was no evidence that the discriminatory conduct caused any permanent damage to Mr. Tahmourpour's ability to work. He is relatively young at 35 years of age, and has the potential for a full career life ahead of him. Mr. Tahmourpour is still eager to become an RCMP officer. He said that if he was given the opportunity to embark on the training program at Depot again, he could ace it.\n[243] Therefore, until Mr. Tahmourpour is provided with an offer to enter the training program he should be paid the difference between the average full-time industrial wage in Canada for persons of his age and the salary that he would have received as an RCMP officer up to the date of the training offer.\n[244] Upon extension of the offer to attend training, the RCMP's obligation to compensate Mr. Tahmourpour for the loss of the opportunity to complete training in 1999 is extinguished. No further payments shall be made under this head of compensation.\n(ii) Prevention of discrimination in the Future - The Systemic Remedy\n[245] Section 53(2)(a) of the Act provides the Tribunal with the authority to order that the Respondent take measures to redress the practice or to prevent the same from occurring in the future.\n[246] I have found that Mr. Tahmourpour was a victim of systemic discrimination at Depot in 1999. Several of the RCMP witnesses testified that they thought that Depot was a much better training environment now that individuals like Corporal Boyer had retired. Corporal Bradley indicated that changes have been made to the training program since Mr. Tahmourpour's attendance there in 1999. Now, in addition to the opportunity that Mr. Tahmourpour had to raise concerns about his instructors to their supervisors twice during the program, the RCMP audits the courses regularly to ensure that the quality of instruction and evaluation is high.\n[247] Mr. Tahmourpour testified that one of the individuals against whom he had a complaint was the very supervisor who was designated to hear the cadets' concerns twice during the program. Mr. Tahmourpour did not feel comfortable raising his concerns with this individual or anyone else at Depot, for fear of reprisal.\n[248] Based on this evidence, and on a Report prepared by the RCMP in April 2006, entitled Employment Systems Review (ESR), I am not convinced that the above-noted changes are sufficient to prevent discrimination of the kind experienced by Mr. Tahmourpour from occurring in the future. The ESR is a study that was commissioned by the RCMP to determine whether the RCMP was in compliance with the Employment Equity Act. In the ESR Report, the authors state that although diversity training is part of the curriculum for the Cadet Training Program, the focus is on respecting diversity in police work. The Diversity Training does not specifically address diversity issues within Depot and within the RCMP. It does not deal with respecting diversity among RCMP employees.\n[249] The authors of the Report found that a number of designated group employees in the RCMP feel they do not experience a high degree of acceptance\/respect of their cultural differences from colleagues within the RCMP. The authors recommended the development of a standardized Diversity Training course targeted to address the internal diversity of the RCMP.\n[250] The authors of the ESR reported that another area of concern is the prevalence of harassment that is experienced especially by women and to some extent, visible minorities. The response to complaints does not appear to be generally positive, and the consequences of lodging a complaint are so great that in some cases people do not lodge the complaint. There is mistrust of the internal system for investigating complaints.\n[251] Sergeant Lise Lachance, the Acting Officer in charge of Employment Equity, testified about the RCMP's efforts with respect to employment equity. She stated that the harassment policy is being revised, and the RCMP was making efforts to combat discrimination within its ranks. However, Sergeant Lachance was not sure whether these efforts extended to the Training Academy at Depot.\n[252] On the basis of this evidence, I conclude that the RCMP must take action to prevent the discrimination that occurred to Mr. Tahmourpour from occurring again. That action should address the issues set out below. However, I think it best to provide the parties with a period of 3 months from the date of this decision to reach an agreement on the exact nature of the measures that should be taken and a timetable for achieving them. I will retain jurisdiction over this portion of the decision in the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement within 3 months. At that point, I will make a final determination on the appropriate measures to be taken by the RCMP.\n[253] The measures to prevent future discrimination should include the following:\nA policy and set of procedures for dealing with harassment and discrimination at Depot that provide an immediate opportunity for cadets to raise their concerns, without fear of retaliation or negative consequences, to someone with the authority to make changes. A copy of the Policy and Procedures should be provided to each cadet, as part of the welcome kit, upon arrival at Depot. A mandatory diversity\/cultural sensitivity training program delivered to both cadets and all personnel at Depot that focuses on developing and promoting a culture of respect and tolerance for diversity within the RCMP. The issues raised in pages 59 - 64 of the Regular Members Survey, Report 3, September 1996, should be taken into account as well as any other relevant material. The suggestions for Diversity Training that are made in the Employment Systems Review by Lakshmi Ram and Associates (April 2006) should also be taken into account, specifically, the need for a training course targeted to address the internal diversity of the RCMP. An Advisory Committee or a Multi-Culturalism officer at Depot who makes recommendations to the Commanding Officer at Depot with regard to the prevention of discrimination and the promotion of respect and tolerance for diversity at Depot. The Commanding Officer should respond in writing to these recommendations and provide reasons if recommendations are rejected.\n(iii) Pain and Suffering\n[254] Section 53(2)(e) of the Act states that the Tribunal may order the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory conduct to compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding $20,000.00, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice. Mr. Tahmourpour requested the maximum award. He testified that he was very upset by the discriminatory treatment he received. It caused him to experience a period of insomnia and difficulty concentrating. However, at times during his testimony he also stated that he was just upset when he left Depot, not depressed or incapable of functioning. Moreover, Mr. Tahmourpour did not always take the medication that would have reduced his suffering.\n[255] I find that while Mr. Tahmourpour experienced some pain and suffering as a result of the discriminatory conduct, it was not of the duration or intensity that merits an award of $20,000. In light of the circumstances of this case, Mr. Tahmourpour should be awarded $9,000 in pain and suffering.\nSpecial compensation - s. 53(3) of the Act\n[256] Section 53(3) of the Act provides that the Tribunal may order a respondent to pay up to $20,000 in compensation to a victim of discrimination if the respondent engaged in the discriminatory practice willfully or recklessly.\n[257] I find on a balance of probabilities that Corporal Boyer willfully or recklessly made discriminatory remarks and verbally harassed Mr. Tahmourpour. I find also that his discriminatory efforts to have Mr. Tahmourpour's training contract terminated were willful or reckless. Corporal Jacques and Corporal Bradley complied with the efforts to have Mr. Tahmourpour removed by providing evaluations that were inaccurate and unfair.\n[258] Prior to the termination of his contract, Mr. Tahmourpour sent a letter of rebuttal to the Chief Training Officer at the time. He addressed each point raised by Corporals Bradley and Jacques in the Request for Termination and alleged that he was treated in a discriminatory manner. The RCMP neither investigated, nor responded to his complaint of discrimination until it was required to respond to Mr. Tahmourpour's formal complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[259] To his credit, Sergeant H\u00e9bert apologized to Mr. Tahmourpour for his discriminatory remark regarding Mr. Tahmourpour's religious pendant. Sergeant H\u00e9bert's conduct is all the more notable in the context of the reckless disregard for the consequences of the other officers' discriminatory conduct.\n[260] I find therefore, that it is appropriate to order the RCMP to pay Mr. Tahmourpour $12,000 in special compensation.\nCosts\n[261] Section 53(2)(c) authorizes the Tribunal to award compensation for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[262] Mr. Tahmourpour incurred expenses in the amount of $9,500 to pay for the Real Estate Board and interpreter courses. He claimed that these expenses, incurred as part of his efforts to mitigate his damages, should be reimbursed by the RCMP. I have found that Mr. Tahmourpour's efforts with regard to minimizing his damages were half-hearted at best. Nonetheless, Mr. Tahmourpour did incur expenses that would not have been necessary had he been permitted to complete training and earn a living as an RCMP officer. Therefore, I order that the RCMP reimburse Mr. Tahmourpour for the cost of the Real Estate and Translator courses.\n[263] The Federal Court has recently once again affirmed the Tribunal's authority to award reasonable legal costs: Canada (Attorney General) v. Mowat 2008 FC 118 at para. 40. See also: Canada (Attorney General) v. Thwaites, [1994] 3 F.C. 38 at para. 56; Stevenson v. Canada (Canadian Security Intelligence Service), 2003 FCT 341 at paras. 23-26; and Canada (Attorney General) v. Brooks, 2006 FC 500.\n[264] Therefore, I order that the RCMP pay Mr. Tahmourpour's reasonable legal costs as an expense arising from the discriminatory conduct. Mr. Tahmourpour did not provide evidence on the issue of legal expenses. Therefore, I am unable to make an order with respect to the quantum of this award. The parties are, however, encouraged to come to an agreement on the quantum of reasonable costs in this matter. I shall retain jurisdiction over this aspect of the award in the event that the parties are unable to reach such an agreement. The parties are to notify the Tribunal within 3 months of the receipt of this decision if an agreement has not been reached.\nInterest\n[265] Interest is payable in respect of the awards made in this decision pursuant to section 53(4) of the Act. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the bank rate (monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada, per Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. The interest on the lost wages shall run from the date that Mr. Tahmourpour would have started to work for the RCMP and shall be calculated as the wages would have become payable to Mr. Tahmourpour.\n[266] With respect to the compensation for pain and suffering and the compensation under s. 53(3), the interest shall run from the date of the complaint. In no case, however, should the total amount payable under s. 53(2)(e) including interest, exceed $20,000. Similarly, the total amount payable under s. 53(3), including interest, should not exceed $20,000.\nVII. ORDERS [267] Pursuant to its authority under s. 53(2) of the Act, the Tribunal orders the following:\nUnless otherwise agreed upon, the Respondent shall offer Mr. Tahmourpour an opportunity to re-enroll in the next available RCMP Cadet Training Program at Depot; If Mr. Tahmourpour accepts the offer of re-enrollment, the Respondent shall undertake a fair assessment of his skills at the outset of the training program to determine the areas in which training is needed; The Respondent shall pay Mr. Tahmourpour compensation for salary and benefits he lost for the first 2 years plus 12 weeks of work as an RCMP officer after graduating from Depot. The compensation shall be discounted by 8%; The Respondent shall pay Mr. Tahmourpour the difference between the average full-time industrial wage in Canada for persons of his age, and the salary that he would have earned as an RCMP officer until such time as Mr. Tahmourpour accepts or rejects an offer of re-enrollment in the training program at Depot. The Respondent shall compensate Mr. Tahmourpour for the average amount of overtime paid to other constables who graduated from Depot in 1999, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The compensation shall be discounted by 8%; The compensation must reflect a promotion to Corporal after 7 years; The parties shall attempt to agree upon the measures and a timetable for addressing the issues set out in the Systemic Remedy part of this decision. In the event that they are unable to reach an agreement on this portion of the award within 3 months from the date of this decision, the Tribunal will make a final determination; The Respondent shall pay $9,000 to Mr. Tahmourpour in compensation for the pain and suffering caused by its discriminatory conduct; The Respondent shall pay $12,000 to Mr. Tahmourpour pursuant to s. 53(3) of the Act; The Respondent shall pay $9,500 to Mr. Tahmourpour in compensation for the expenses he incurred in minimizing his losses. The Respondent shall also compensate Mr. Tahmourpour for the legal expenses he incurred in this matter; The Respondent shall pay interest on the compensation awarded in this decision as set out above.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] In a judgment dated January 30, 2008, the Federal Court set aside my decision on costs in the present case and referred it back to the Tribunal for redetermination (Attorney General of Canada v. Mowat, 2008 FC 118). The Court's judgment agreed with the Tribunal's power to make a compensation award of legal expenses in this case. It also made no comment on the appropriate quantum of compensation for legal costs awarded by the Tribunal. However, the Court decided that the Tribunal had failed under a duty to provide adequate reasons for its award of legal expenses and remitted it to the same Tribunal decision maker, without the necessity of further submissions or hearing.\n[2] The Attorney General of Canada has appealed the Federal Court decision on the ground of jurisdiction to award costs. The Attorney General of Canada has not brought a motion before the Tribunal to defer the issuance of its supplementary reasons nor, to the Tribunal's knowledge, has the Attorney General sought or obtained a stay prohibiting the Tribunal from rendering supplementary reasons in this matter.\n[3] Ms. Mowat was a Master Corporal at the time of her complaint, dated June 15, 1998 and filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. She alleged that the Canadian Armed Forces discriminated against her on the grounds of sex:\ni) by adversely differentiating against her in employment and refusing to continue her employment with the Canadian Armed Forces, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6; and ii) by failing to provide her with a harassment free workplace contrary to section 14 of the Act. Included in her harassment complaint is an allegation of sexual harassment.\n[4] Ms. Mowat also alleged retaliation under s. 14.1 of the Act. This allegation was heard as a preliminary motion and dismissed by the Tribunal. In her Statement of Particulars filed with the Tribunal, Ms. Mowat claimed compensation of $430,685 (not including unspecified amounts for CPP contributions, CAF pension, mental suffering and punitive bad faith damages and excluding her legal costs).\n[5] The hearing of her complaint, which consumed approximately six (6) weeks, over 4,000 pages of transcript evidence and more than 200 exhibits. The Tribunal found that Ms. Mowat's complaint of sexual harassment was substantiated and she was awarded $4,000 plus interest for pain and suffering. The Tribunal dismissed all of her other allegations of discrimination, including her claims of discriminatory discharge, adverse differentiation in employment and harassment other than sexual harassment.\n[6] Both parties made written and oral submissions, on March 20, 2006, to the Tribunal on the question of legal costs. Ms. Mowat stated that she did not expect to recover 100%, or even 75%, of the total $196,313 of the legal fees she initially submitted. The Respondent argued that the Complainant's account should be denied or that her costs be strictly limited because the Complainant was unsuccessful for the most part of her allegations and the hearing was unnecessarily prolonged and complicated as a result of a lack of clear articulation of her complaints.\n[7] As noted above, the Tribunal's decision that it had jurisdiction to award costs under subsection 53(2)(c) of the Act was undisturbed by the Court's judgment. My supplemental reasons for assessing to Ms. Mowat the amount of $47,000 for her legal costs under subsection 53(2)(c) are as follows.\n[8] In the particular circumstances of this case, the Tribunal felt it would be helpful to have the Complainant's legal expenses expressed in a format similar to Tariff B of the Federal Court Rules. The Complainant complied by submitting her Bill of Costs dated May 30, 2006. By letter dated June 30, 2006, the Respondent replied with its own suggested amounts based on the Bill submitted by the Complainant.\n[9] The Complainant claimed preparation and attendance fees in respect of mediation and settlement conferences that took place separately in March 2002 and September 2003. This complaint was referred to the Tribunal in January 2003. I agree that the Complainant should recover partial fees before this Tribunal for participating in the September 2003 conference, but not for both. I therefore allowed 15 units for 5 hours of attendance and 4 units for preparation as being reasonable costs to be recovered by Ms. Mowat in respect of the settlement conference in 2003 only.\n[10] The Complainant claimed 5 units for documents disclosure. Full and complete disclosure is a requirement in proceedings before this Tribunal. I therefore allowed this item as claimed.\n[11] The Complainant claimed a total of 24 units with respect to the motion regarding the participation of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. I note that Complainant counsel prepared no materials, took no clear position and only made very brief submissions with respect to this motion. It would therefore be unreasonable, in my view, to expect the Respondent to bear this expense. I have disallowed this claim.\n[12] The Complainant requested the maximum units under column III of Federal Court Tariff B in respect of counsel fees for preparation for hearing under item 13(a) and then for 26 days of hearing under item 13(b). She further claimed the maximum for 22 full days and 5 half-days of attendance at hearing under items 14(a) and 14(b) of the Tariff.\n[13] As noted above, the Tribunal dismissed all of the Complainant's allegations of discrimination, as well as the allegation of retaliation under s. 14.1 of the Act. Ms. Mowat succeeded only on her complaint based on sexual harassment. The Tribunal also noted in its decision on the merits of the complaint that, apart from Ms. Mowat's allegation of sexual harassment, the case was marked by a fundamental lack of precision in identifying the theory of her case.\n[14] Compelling as this may be for reducing the amount of fees that the Respondent should have to bear, it remains compelling also that the Commission exercised a clear discretion in deciding to refer Ms. Mowat's complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry. The Complainant, without the benefit of today's hindsight, was thus compelled to pursue the full gambit of her complaint. Such cases of alleged discrimination are very often factually complex. Moreover, at the end of the day, the Respondent was found to have discriminated against Ms. Mowat.\n[15] Having considered the foregoing, as well as the outcome of the complaint, the manner in which the Complainant's case was presented at hearing and having reviewed the number of days at hearing, I allowed 5 units under item 13(a) for preparation for hearing and 50 units under item 13(b) in respect of the 25 days following the first day of hearing. As to the claims for counsel fees for attendance at hearing, I have allowed a total of 275 units in respect of 137.5 hours of hearing.\n[16] No special reason being apparent for the need for second counsel, I have disallowed the Complainant's costs claimed under Tariff item 14(b). Based on the foregoing considerations and the complexity required in fitting the Tribunal's proceedings to the itemized Tariff of the Federal Court, I have allowed 5 units for counsel fees for the preparation and presentation of the Complainant's bill of costs.\n[17] The account submitted by the Complainant included an hourly rate of $250 for her counsel's fees. Counsel for the Respondent replied that the Federal Court Tariff B unit value of $120.00, as at April 1, 2005, would be more appropriate. In the circumstances of this case, and having particular regard for the limited success of Ms. Mowat's complaint, I am inclined to agree with the Respondent on this point. I have allowed a total of 359 units in respect of counsel fees. Applying a unit value of $120.00, this equates to an assessment of $43,080 for counsel fees.\n[18] The Complainant has submitted a claim of $6,499.83 for legal fees payable to the law firm of Gahrns & Lalibert\u00e9. It is unclear how much and to what extent these services relate to the present complaint, but it is evident from the invoice produced that some consultation was relevant to the complaint referred before this Tribunal. The Respondent has been found liable for discriminating against Ms. Mowat. It is therefore reasonable, in my view, to allow the $800 paid out of pocket by the Complainant for this service, as was also agreed by Respondent counsel in oral submissions.\n[19] The approach taken by Respondent counsel with respect to the Complainant's claim for hotel expenses seems entirely reasonable to the circumstances of this case. It has therefore been allowed in an amount of $2,754. The claim of $265 for parking and taxis is less clear, however, and has been reduced to $115. Some documentation for parking and taxis has been produced as evidence of an expense, but a clear and convincing accounting is lacking. The claim for courier expenses has been reduced as well to $26.10 for similar reasons.\n[20] The claim of $81 in respect of the witness Campbell has been allowed. The witness's testimony was relevant to the complaint and it is clear that this amount was paid out of pocket.\n[21] The claims in amounts of $10.83, $2,166.75, $187.25, $26.75 and $404.46 for photocopies, faxes, binders, tabs, computer prints, long distance and mileage have been disallowed for lack of a clear accounting and their precise relationship to the proceedings before this Tribunal. It is not reasonable to expect the Respondent, on an assessment that is akin to a party-and-party basis, to pay for expenses such as these, which may otherwise be considered overhead, unless clearly accounted and demonstrated to have been incurred in direct relation to the proceedings at hand.\n[22] The Complainant also claims for a Pension Valuation costing $856.00. Respondent counsel argued that the Complainant was entirely unsuccessful with respect to the pension issue and should not be able to recover this expense from the Respondent as a disbursement. I agree and this amount has therefore been refused.\n[23] The Complainant has submitted a claim as well of $3,045.67 for transcripts. The Tribunal's remark that the case was marked by a fundamental lack of precision in identifying the theory of Ms. Mowat's case is once again relevant to the consideration of this item. Transcripts, other than for purposes of appeal, are a luxury. Absent special circumstances substantiating their exceptional utility to assist counsel at the hearing of this complaint (e.g., to help in reducing the time at hearing), the Respondent should not be expected to pay for this. This disbursement has therefore been refused.\n[24] Invoices were also submitted by the Complainant for a total of $343.90 for Quicklaw Research. It is fair to say that human rights law is somewhat less pervasive in practice as other areas of law. It is therefore extremely important, in the scheme of presenting a convincing argument to support a claim of discrimination under the Act, to assist the Tribunal in its deliberation by providing accurate and current case law. It might otherwise be argued that the cost of Quicklaw research should be considered as part of a law firm's overhead, rather than being an out-of-pocket expense. I have reduced this item to $143.90. This research is as much helpful to the Tribunal as it is to a party's case, but the very narrow success of the Complainant's complaint militates against allowing this expense in full.\n[25] Accordingly, and in addition to the earlier reasons given by this Tribunal, Ms. Mowat is awarded the total amount of $47,000 for her legal costs under s. 53(2)(c) of the Act. Ms. Mowat's interest claim to the date of this decision, for reasons already explained, is denied. However, interest is to be paid on the costs award from the date of this decision to the date of payment of the award, again calculated in accordance with Rule 9(12)(a) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure.\nSigned by J.

It was 2002 and the new Terminal 1 at Pearson International Airport in Toronto was rushing to completion. The employees in the Information Technology department of the Respondent Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) were on a tight time-line to get the computer system in operation for the new Terminal 1. This was the context in which the Complainant, Marie-Therese Fahmy, found herself when she joined the GTAA's IT Systems Operations as a network analyst in July 2002.\n[2] At first, things seemed fine for Ms. Fahmy. However, as time went on, from her perspective and that of her employer, issues emerged. This began with the arrival of her new manager a few weeks after she started work at GTAA. The relationship deteriorated. From the employer's perspective, her work performance was simply not consistently satisfactory. However, because her work performance had improved since the first performance appraisal, her probationary period was extended. On May 1, 2003 - ten months after she began - GTAA terminated her employment. She filed a grievance alleging wrongful termination and a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) alleging discrimination contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended (CHRA) based on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, colour and sex.\nII. BACKGROUND [3] The Commission referred the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) on December 30, 2005. The parties estimated ten days for the hearing. The Commission did not attend or participate at the hearing. At the first day of the hearing, counsel for the Complainant requested that the hearing be bifurcated. The Respondent consented. The Complainant's counsel indicated that she had recently taken over the case from previous counsel and was not able to get medical reports in time for the remedial portion of the hearing. Counsel also indicated that there were some mental health issues of the Complainant that her client did not wish to reveal unless it became necessary. They were not relevant to the liability part of the hearing. Because I was doubtful that the entire hearing could be completed in the agreed ten days in any event, I reluctantly agreed to bifurcate the hearing.\n[4] Unfortunately, my suspicions were confirmed. The hearing ended up taking 21 \u00bd days, including a motion for non-suit. While counsel for the parties underestimated the time needed, in fairness to them, there were other factors involved. Some of the witnesses took an inordinate amount of time on the stand. For example, the Complainant's testimony alone took almost eight days of hearing. Questions had to be repeated as answers were simply not responsive to the questions. There were many objections made throughout the hearing, mainly by counsel for the Respondent. I should add that many of her objections were sustained.\n[5] Aside from the length of the hearing, I was concerned about the length of time over which it was spread - one year exactly. This was due to the busy schedule of counsel. It was very difficult finding blocks of time that both counsel had available. I mention this because it has been five years since Ms. Fahmy's employment ended at GTAA. The Commission took 2 \u00bd years to refer the case to the Tribunal; the hearing itself was spread over one year. It is obviously not in the interests of either party (or the non-participating Commission) to have the matter take so long to reach a conclusion. From the parties' and the witnesses' points of view, memories fade and giving testimony becomes more difficult. From the Tribunal's perspective, it made it more challenging to adjudicate. However, I am satisfied that the viva voce evidence, along with the documentary evidence, was cogent enough that I am able to make findings of fact and law and come to a disposition.\nIII. THE USE OF INITIALS [6] One will see throughout my Reasons for Decision that I make some strong findings regarding the credibility of the Complainant and certain witnesses, and their respective evidence. Because of this and the harsh accusations by the Complainant toward her manager in particular and against other witnesses, and by other witnesses against each other, I have decided to use initials for some of the witnesses, to protect their privacy and reputations. I have not used initials for the parties.\nIV. THE COMPLAINT [7] Ms. Fahmy claims that her rights under subsections 7(a) and 7(b) of the CHRA were violated by the GTAA. Section 7 reads:\nIt is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\na) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\nb) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\nbased on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nMs. Fahmy is claiming the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, colour and sex. She is a woman of colour, and of Egyptian origin.\n[8] The Complainant filed her Complaint on June 14, 2003. She had reformulated it several times. Indeed, the Commission initially refused to deal with her Complaint. I should add that this does not factor into my determination, as the hearing before the Tribunal is a de novo one. In my Reasons I address the particular allegations.\n[9] The gist of her Complaint (based on the actual Complaint form filed, her Statement of Particulars filed with the Tribunal (akin to a pleading) and her viva voce testimony) is against her manager, S.M., who became her manager a few weeks after she began to work at GTAA. His predecessor had hired her. In her Complaint form, she also mentions that A.W., project manager, operations, who supervised her from January-April 2003, ...tried to destroy my self-esteem, notwithstanding her testimony that he was very nice to her. But her focus is on S.M. He is not a party; the GTAA is the only respondent. In her letter to GTAA President and CEO Louis Turpen dated May 4, 2003 following her termination, she said she did not blame the GTAA, only S.M. for discriminating against her. She wrote: ...he didn't like me for my background. She did not mention any discrimination based on her gender. As well, in a letter to the Commission which was stamped received December 11, 2003, Ms. Fahmy wrote, I strongly believe that my Human Rights complaint is about giving my job to white people. There is no mention of gender or sex discrimination. She only claims discrimination based on sex later. As well, in the hearing, Ms. Fahmy alleged that A.W. secretly assigned technical jobs to the white contractors - nothing about gender-based discrimination.\n[10] Notwithstanding S.M. is not a party, of course GTAA may be deemed liable (analogous to vicarious liability under tort law) for any discriminatory conduct by him (or any other manager, employee, contractor\/consultant as agent) in the course of his employment, pursuant to section 65 of the CHRA. This is so unless the respondent employer can show it did not consent to the discriminatory practice, took reasonable due diligence to prevent it and mitigated its effect.\n[11] In her Complaint form, Ms. Fahmy claims that her job was given to a less qualified white contractor. She also says her white manager, S.M., favoured the white guys over the accented people of colour. She writes that he made sexist comments to her. As well, Ms. Fahmy states that S.M. gave her an unfair performance appraisal, full of wrong accusation [sic]. She says she complained to Maria Maack, the human resources manager, about S.M.'s treatment of her, but to no avail. She also writes, [S.M.] avoided me and refused to acknowledge my good performance. [Her underlining.]\nV. MOTION FOR NON-SUIT A. The Election Issue [12] At the conclusion of the Complainant's case, counsel for the Respondent indicated she intended to bring a motion for non-suit. I received written submissions about the issue of whether GTAA would be put to an election not to call evidence if the motion was heard. I ruled that GTAA would not be required to make an election.\n[13] Regarding the issue of the election, I have a few comments. First, the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to decide whether an election is required and to hear a motion for non-suit: Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 FC 785. Hughes J. pointed out at para. 22 that the matter of requiring an election is one of procedure, not of law or natural justice: Tribunals should be allowed reasonable latitude when it comes to procedure... Second, there are thoughtful decisions at the Tribunal-level both requiring and not requiring an election to be made prior to hearing a motion for non-suit. In both decisions, the respective members agreed that the question should be decided in the circumstances of each case: Chopra v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), [1999] C.H.R.D. No. 5 and Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 CHRT 30. In the civil context, most jurisdictions in Canada do not require an election.1 While there are sound legal and policy reasons for both determinations, I am more persuaded by the arguments in favour of not requiring an election. In the CHRA context, there is no pre-trial oral discovery process available to the parties. There is no motion for summary judgment.2 Indeed, an award of costs is not available to a victorious respondent in the CHRA proceeding before the Tribunal. A respondent dealing with a frivolous or vexatious complaint has little recourse to a summary determination short of a full hearing at the Tribunal, once the Commission has referred the complaint to the Tribunal. Accordingly, I do not believe it is fair to require a respondent to make an election not to call evidence as a condition precedent to having his motion for non-suit heard. No evidence was presented to me to suggest that not requiring elections increases the number of non-suit motions made, thus prolonging the hearing process.\nB. Ruling on the Motion for Non-Suit [14] On July 3, 2007, I heard argument on the motion for non-suit. Soon thereafter, I advised the parties of the following ruling:\nThe motion for non-suit is dismissed. I am satisfied that there is some evidence which, if believed, could trigger liability under the CHRA. This does not suggest that the evidence will be believed and liability established at the conclusion of the hearing, whether GTAA elects to call evidence or not. In either situation (i.e., if GTAA calls evidence or not), when the hearing closes, I will undertake the usual weighing and assessing of the evidence, including credibility, which I am not permitted to do on a motion for non-suit.\nIn the circumstances of this case, where the Respondent was permitted to bring the motion for non-suit without having to make the election not to call evidence, I think it would be inappropriate to issue detailed Reasons now. Accordingly, my Reasons for Decision will be issued upon the completion of the hearing.\n... ...\n[15] One will see from my ruling above that I essentially gave no reasons, with the promise to give full reasons at the conclusion of the hearing. This addresses the commentary in the various cases dealing with elections and non-suits concerning whether reasons should be given, and when and to what extent, where an election is not required. Obviously it is not an issue where the motion for non-suit is successful or where an election is required to be given. Adjudicator Slotnick in Potocnik v. Thunder Bay (City), [1996] O.H.R.B.I.D. No. 16, at para. 16 cites with approval the approach taken in Tomen v. O.T.F. (No. 3), (1989) 11 C.H.R.R. D\/223 not to give reasons. At para. 10, Adjudicator Slotnick states:\n...where an adjudicator does not require an election and ends up rejecting the motion to dismiss the complaint, the proper procedure is to give no reasons. Otherwise, the party that is about to present its evidence would have the advantage of the adjudicator's thoughts on the evidence of the other party.\nIn Filgueira, supra, Member Groarke refers to a respondent taking the temperature of the Tribunal. I agree that a respondent should not get an advantage from bringing an unsuccessful non-suit motion by getting to test the waters of a tribunal. The adjudicator should not give reasons, other than to say whether a prima facie test has been made out. That is the approach I have taken in this case.\nC. The Law With Respect to Non-Suit Motions [16] Sometimes referred to as a motion for dismissal in the case law, the purpose of the motion for non-suit makes sense. In the adversarial process, a defendant is not forced to lead evidence. The burden of proof rests with the proponent of the case - the plaintiff. The defendant should not be relied upon to help prove a plaintiff's case. As well, if a plaintiff is not able to present sufficient (or any) evidence to prove in fact and in law that liability should ensue, the defendant should not be obligated to run his or her case, at great expense to the parties and the public court system.\n[17] While a defendant's resources and the public purse should not be burdened to pay for frivolous or vexatious claims, the courts have set a high bar for non-suit motions to succeed. This is done through various means: the prima facie test requiring a presumption that a plaintiff's evidence be believed, in essence the benefit of the doubt going to the plaintiff; forcing an election to be made by a defendant (in those jurisdictions that require it); and the awarding of costs against an unsuccessful moving party. The courts have clearly determined that it should not be too easy for a defendant to knock out a lawsuit on a motion for non-suit. Perhaps there is a fear of delay to the process if unsuccessful non-suit motions became the norm. On the other hand, as Adjudicator Wildsmith stated in Gerin v. IMP Group Ltd., [1994] N.S.H.R.B.I.D. No. 4, at para. 21: ...I note that the motion for non-suit is a potential safeguard against abuse.\nD. The Prima Facie Case in Non-Suit Motions [18] There have been differences espoused by the courts over the years regarding the proper test to be applied to non-suit motions. For example, does the plaintiff need to adduce sufficient evidence or simply any evidence on the elements of the case to defeat a motion for non-suit? Is there a difference in the criminal vs. civil context?\n[19] On the civil side, and this includes for my purposes, the present case before me, the test for the moving party is: has there been some evidence led which, if believed, could trigger liability, in the absence of an answer from the defendant (or respondent in the CHRA context)? In other words, is there a case for the defendant to answer? If yes, the motion is dismissed; if the answer is negative, the motion is granted. An unsuccessful motion for non-suit does not mean that the plaintiff will win the day at the conclusion of the hearing proper. It simply means this high bar for a preliminary dismissal has not been reached.\n[20] It is important to note the different analytical approaches used in the non-suit and on the merits determination. As Member Groarke noted in another decision in Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 CHRT 32, at para. 12, in a motion for non-suit there is a different kind of analysis undertaken than that carried out on the merits at the end of a hearing. The courts have been quite clear that a trial judge or adjudicator should not do the regular weighing and assessing of evidence, including credibility, that is done in the normal course at the conclusion of a trial or hearing. To confuse the two processes is an error in law. The trier at the non-suit is measuring the case from a prima facie perspective - very superficially, at first glance or sight as the Latin term prima facie literally means. No in-depth perusing of the evidence or assessment of the credibility of the witnesses is done. As Adjudicator Wildsmith correctly pointed out in Gerin, supra at para. 7: ...the quality of the evidence should not be assessed at this point. Further, as Adjudicator Baum wrote in Tomen, supra at para. 29: I am bound to view the evidence through a narrow prism. I am not, as such, evaluating conflicting evidence. I would add that that includes conflicting evidence within a complainant's own case, unless of course, it is simply so unbelievable. At the non-suit stage, there is almost an evidential presumption of truth - evidence if believed. The plaintiff or complainant gets the benefit of the doubt. Indeed, the bar is cast so high that it is only if the complainant's case is totally unbelievable or far-fetched (i.e., one would have to suspend one's belief to accept it) that it should be disbelieved.3 The result is that it is difficult for a moving party to be successful on a motion for non-suit. Furthermore, if the court or tribunal requires an election, given the high threshold, very few defendant or respondent lawyers would take that risk.\n[21] The role of the trial judge in a motion for non-suit was recently canvassed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in FL Receivables Trust 2002-A (Administrator of) v. Cobrand Foods Ltd. (2007), 85 O.R.(3d) 561. The Court held that the trial judge applied the wrong test in granting the non-suit motion ...by going beyond his limited mandate... on the non-suit motion. Laskin J.A. wrote at paras. 35-36:\nOn a non-suit motion, the trial judge undertakes a limited inquiry. Two relevant principles that guide this inquiry are these. First, if a plaintiff puts forward some evidence on all elements of its claim, the judge must dismiss the motion. Second, in assessing whether a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, the judge must assume the evidence to be true and must assign the most favourable meaning to evidence capable of giving rise to competing inferences...\nIn other words, on a non-suit motion the trial judge should not determine whether the competing inferences available to the defendant on the evidence rebut the plaintiff's prima facie case. The trial judge should make that determination at the end of the trial, not on the non-suit motion. See John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman & Alan W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths Canada, 1999) at 139.\nI assume that the Court is not suggesting the assumption of truth of the evidence includes evidence that is unbelievable in the extreme, or simply preposterous.\n[22] I also wish to point out that there is some confusion in the case law about whether the test requires that the evidence would or could trigger liability. Courts and tribunals have taken both approaches and some avoid the issue altogether. In Filgueira, supra, Hughes J. quotes with approval at para. 6 the following passage in Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant: The judge must conclude whether a reasonable trier of fact could find in the plaintiff's favour if it believed the evidence given in the trial up to that point. [My italics.] It appears clear that the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted the could approach, at least in the civil and criminal context, which I have followed here.4 I see no reason to deviate from it in proceedings before the Tribunal.\n[23] Is there a different evidential burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination at the non-suit stage than outside such a motion, in the normal course of a hearing after both parties have led their case? This was not in issue before me in the instant case. Consequently, I leave that issue for another day.\nE. Particular Allegations and Facts in this Non-Suit Motion [24] I now turn to apply the law on non-suits to the allegations and facts in issue here. GTAA argues that there is no evidence which, if believed, is capable of supporting a finding of liability against it on either subsection 7(a) or 7(b) of the CHRA and in respect of any of the claimed prohibited grounds. The Complainant argues the opposite.\n[25] Having carefully examined the evidence, both viva voce and documentary, by the Complainant and her witnesses, as I indicated in my ruling, I was satisfied evidence existed which, if believed, could trigger liability. For purposes of the non-suit, I do not have to go through each of the allegations. A prima facie case need only be established on a single count under section 7 for each claimed prohibited ground, in order for the motion to be dismissed. I appreciate that some of the allegations involve the prohibited ground of sex and others the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, and colour. Some of the allegations also involve all of the claimed prohibited grounds, as it is often difficult to parse people's immutable characteristics in the finding of discriminatory practices.\n[26] I have done this analysis on the motion for non-suit following these legal parameters: giving the benefit of the doubt to the Complainant, putting the absolute best interpretation on the evidence of her and her witnesses, and not taking into account questions of credibility.\n[27] With regards to the question of liability under section 7 on the basis of sex, for purposes of the non-suit only, I find that the allegation of improper sexual statements against Ms. Fahmy on two occasions by S.M. or A.W. (but not M.G.) could trigger liability of GTAA. In particular, S.G.'s evidence is believable, for purposes of the non-suit, that either S.M. or A.W. made disparaging comments behind Ms. Fahmy's back in two meetings among the three of them. The comments were sexually degrading and involved the Complainant performing fellatio and were made by a manager of GTAA. Such comments, even though not brought to her attention until after her employment termination, could have constituted adverse differential treatment and factored into her employment termination on account of her gender. Included in this determination is the evidence of Ms. Fahmy that S.M. made sexist comments like, It's still a man's world and let the men win. I also factor in the fact that Ms. Fahmy was the only woman in the IT department under S.M.'s supervision.\n[28] I also find for purposes of this non-suit only that there existed some evidence, which if believed, could result in liability contrary to section 7 on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, and colour. In particular, the following incidents in totality show on a prima facie basis, adverse differential treatment of Ms. Fahmy culminating in the decision to terminate her employment on the basis of her race, national or ethnic origin, and colour:\nshe was hired to be the technical lead on the MS Windows 2000 infrastructure project, but it was taken away from her and given to a white contractor with fewer qualifications than she, M.G.; Pre-Production Centre work was taken away from her and given to another white contractor, B.M., who was also less qualified than she; Ms. Fahmy was excluded from meetings, including one on January 30th, while the white contractors were not (i.e., A.W., D.M., B.M., M.G.); S.M. made a disparaging comment that could be viewed as being directed at accented employees\/contractors of colour: I want people who can communicate better; white employees got training, but not the Complainant or the other people of colour; white, male colleagues had access to the Campus Area Network, but not her or the other employees\/contractors of colour; and with respect to all claimed prohibited grounds, there is evidence that D.M. was told by S.M. to make-up performance\/deficiency issues to justify terminating Ms. Fahmy's employment. This was said prior to her probationary period being extended and thus taints the bona fides of the whole performance appraisal process and extension of the probationary period.\nVI. REASONS FOR DECISION ON THE MERITS [29] Having dismissed the motion for non-suit, I asked counsel for the Respondent if she wished to call evidence. Understandably, Ms. Rusak answered yes and I proceeded to hear her witnesses and the brief Reply evidence of Ms. Fahmy. What follows are my Reasons for dismissing the Complaint on the merits.\nA. The Law [30] The initial onus of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination under the CHRA rests with a complainant or the Commission5: Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpsons-Sears Limited, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28. Once that is established, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish a justification or explanation for the discriminatory practice or action. The respondent's explanation should not figure in the determination of whether the complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination: Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 2004, at para. 22.\n[31] Also relevant to the instant case is the legal principle that: It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue in order that the complaint may succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors for the employer's decision: Morris v. Canada (Armed Forces) (2001), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/443 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 69.\n[32] The case law recognizes the difficulty of proving allegations of discrimination by direct evidence. Discrimination is frequently practised in a very subtle and subterranean manner. Overt discrimination is rare: Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No. 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 5038. Rather, it is the Tribunal's task to consider all of the circumstances to determine if there is, in what is described in the Basi case as, the subtle scent of discrimination.\n[33] The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. According to this standard, discrimination may be inferred where the evidence offered in support of the discrimination renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses: Premakumar v. Air Canada (No. 2) (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 81.\nB. Findings of Credibility [34] As an adjudicator, I am mindful that the hearing room is an artificial environment where witnesses react in individual and different ways to the stresses of giving testimony, etc. Accordingly, their demeanour is used as only one indicium of credibility. More important is the content of their testimony and what they did, said and wrote (as documentary evidence is important too) in the past events that form the basis of the subject matter of the Complaint before me, and how their evidence fares in the context of the totality of the evidence presented. I also wish to add that finding a witness credible or not does not mean that everything the witness says or writes is accepted or rejected. I have tried to make sense of all the evidence and make findings of fact about what actually occurred.\n[35] As in many cases, credibility played an important part here. In my Reasons, I comment on the credibility of various witnesses. Here specifically, I wish to comment mainly on the credibility of the two most important witnesses in the hearing: the Complainant; and S.M. Although S.M. was not named as a party in the referral by the Commission, the Complaint and the theory of the Complainant's case always focused on S.M. as the alleged discriminator of Ms. Fahmy.\n[36] Ms. Rusak submits that the Complainant, D.M. and S.G. perjured themselves before the Tribunal; their testimony was so unbelievable. While I won't go so far as to find that they perjured themselves, by the end of the hearing their credibility was damaged.\n(i) The Complainant [37] The Complainant's credibility was in question throughout the hearing, both in terms of what she said on the stand and what she wrote in emails and letters, and juxtaposed against other witnesses' evidence. She was not very credible and her evidence not reliable in many instances. She was on the stand for almost eight days. Ms. Fahmy was frequently evasive. She did not answer many questions the first time asked; some required repeated asking, particularly in cross-examination. Sometimes she would contradict herself within the span of minutes, and certainly from the examination-in-chief to the cross-examination. I do not believe language was the problem. While English is not her first language, and while she may not be totally fluent, her language facility in English is very good: both verbal and written. I judge this by her testimony and the numerous documents she wrote that were entered into evidence. I even asked her if she was having difficulty understanding the questions. She answered no. I sometimes noticed that she would try to anticipate the cross-examiner's question before it was asked. I interjected numerous times, letting her know I understand it is stressful, but to listen carefully to the question and answer the question directly.\n[38] Aside from her evasive demeanour, the content of many of her answers was unbelievable. I do not think she answered many of the questions honestly. Indeed, there was one instance where Ms. Rusak was asking her a question and the Complainant said she wasn't concentrating because she was reading the performance appraisal exhibit. Counsel replied that that was not true, that the Complainant was looking right at her, staring her [counsel] down. Ms. Fahmy replied: Yeah. Okay...You don't know...I'm looking and I'm reading. I was watching Ms. Fahmy during the whole exchange. Ms. Rusak was correct.\n[39] Later in my Reasons under the specific headings of allegations, I will deal with some of the Complainant's evidence and that of other witnesses regarding her which raised concerns about her credibility. For now, I will give some examples. First, it was quite apparent that Ms. Fahmy misrepresented her experience in her curriculum vitae that was presented to GTAA via the placement agency, Agelon, when she was hired. In particular, in the curriculum vitae she gave to the Commission post-GTAA employment, she writes under the heading Work Experience that she was a Senior Network Analyst at GTAA. This is clearly untrue. In her testimony she acknowledged that she was hired at the GTAA as a Network Analyst and not as a Senior Network Analyst. She knew that there was a clear difference between the two jobs, in terms of classification, salary, duties and responsibilities. She did the same thing with other former employers on this c.v. (i.e., adding Senior). The c.v. she gave GTAA, via the placement agency, in April 2002 is different than the one produced to the Commission by the Complainant and which includes her employment post-GTAA. In addition, the dates she worked at several employers were not the same on both resum\u00e9s: in one case, the Ontario Financing Authority, there was a seven month discrepancy. She also left out a company for which she had worked for over one year on her c.v. given to GTAA. When cross-examined on the discrepancies, she replied that a priest had told her it was alright to do so, ...it's not a lie if you put the same amount of years of experience. It doesn't matter how many companies. Ms. Fahmy indicated that she also was told it's okay to shrink your curriculum vitae as long as you highlight the important things. She also testified that she spoke with some human resources person in an Ontario government ministry about how to do the resum\u00e9 and how to make it short. She implied that the Ministry employee told her it was alright to alter work periods so as to avoid gaps in employment. She also stated, ...when I apply for a job that's not senior, I go remove all my senior or put them back. It's not about how accurate it is. It's about answering questions for the employer and being able to do the job. In cross-examination, she admitted that the c.v. she presented to get her job at GTAA was not completely true and accurate.\n[40] Another area damaging her credibility and making her evidence unreliable involves the question of her being busy or not while working at GTAA, and whether she accepted the evaluation of her work in the performance appraisals. Suffice to say that her evidence was contradictory. At one point, she testified that she was not busy 50-60 percent of the time from January-May 2003, because work had been taken away from her. This is so notwithstanding she had put in consistently for overtime and the evidence of several witnesses was that it was a busy time and there was lots of work for everyone. As well, she had replied in an April 8, 2003 email to S.M.'s request of his employees' work schedules that she was quite busy: Daily activity: Support WNT\/2000, and Exchange servers 90% of my time. In cross-examination, when it was put to her that her email reply was simply untrue, she replied that S.M. should know how busy they are: ...the manager should know what we are doing. She also testified that she was concerned if she had said she wasn't busy, that she might have been fired.\n[41] Ms. Fahmy's evidence about the work appraisals also raised credibility concerns about her. She testified that she had not read the entire November 8, 2002 appraisal; she had read parts of it; she didn't understand part of it. Later, she stated, A big part, I read but didn't agree with. A small part, I never read. This is coupled with the written response she gave to that issue. Having reviewed the appraisal and her written response, I conclude she could not have written what she did without having read the entire appraisal. Furthermore, in her May 5, 2003 letter to the Commission, Ms. Fahmy wrote at p. 2: Then I went home and read the performance appraisal and I found too many wrong accusations. Clearly she read it, as she should have, given it was her responsibility as a probationary employee to read the appraisal to understand what areas she needed to improve.\n[42] Regarding the content of the performance appraisal, she testified she didn't agree with it. There are clearly documents indicating her concern with some of it, including the suggestion that she missed many deadlines and the later giving of examples. Yet she also wrote that she agreed with it and would try to do better. She explains this by saying she was trying to win him over and that she didn't mean what she wrote. She wrote to S.M. that she likes him sooo [sic] very much, when in fact she testified she thought S.M. was a racist at that time, but was trying to win him. In essence, I find it difficult to determine whether she was telling the truth in the first instance, or telling the truth that she wasn't being truthful.\n[43] Her evidence regarding her December 6, 2002 meeting with human resources manager Maria Maack is not believable in the main as well. She avers that she showed Ms. Maack emails demonstrating S.M. was harassing her and didn't like her because she is a woman. There is no email corroborating this. She says she wanted Ms. Maack to start an investigation into the matter. She says Ms. Maack refused to do anything. Ms. Fahmy also wrote, The sex discrimination was raised between Maria Maack and me only. I find her evidence utterly unbelievable. I do not accept her testimony that she alerted a seasoned human resources manager, who trains others regarding discrimination and harassment issues and investigates such matters, and that Ms. Maack refused to do anything. This would be contrary to the collective agreement and internal anti-discrimination\/harassment policies of the GTAA. As Ms. Maack stated, if she failed to respond like that, she (Ms. Maack) would no longer have a job. I accept Ms. Maack's viva voce evidence and her email to S.M. and to file dated December 9, 2002 as reflective of what occurred at the meeting. I wish to add that I found Ms. Maack quite credible on the stand.\n(ii) S.M. [44] S.M. was Ms. Fahmy's manager. He started several weeks after she began working at GTAA. He was a new manager and indeed, he testified that he had never done a performance review before. While I do not accept all of his testimony, for the most part, I find S.M. was quite credible as a witness and his evidence reliable. He answered the questions succinctly and his viva voce testimony was generally consistent with his emails and letters, and with the preponderance of the evidence in the case.\n[45] One area that I did not accept his evidence on concerned Ms. Fahmy remaining the technical lead on W2000 even to the last day. Having reviewed the testimony of the other witnesses and the documentary evidence, while still a network analyst (the position for which she was hired), by the time her employment was terminated, she was no longer the technical lead on W2000. For example, I accept Ozgur Erkucuk's evidence that she was eventually taken off the project. This will be discussed further in my Reasons.\nC. The Allegations: Introduction [46] I will deal now with the numerous allegations of the Complainant and issues that flow from them, under subsections 7(a) and 7(b) of the CHRA. Some involve all the claimed prohibited grounds, others involve sex only and some race, national or ethnic origin, and colour only. Unless stated otherwise, each allegation deals with all four claimed prohibited grounds. Ms. MacKinnon, counsel for the Complainant, argues that each allegation of adverse differential treatment may not on its own attach liability to GTAA, but collectively they do.\n[47] In final argument, Ms. MacKinnon submits that I make a finding of harassment, although she was not advancing a section 14 harassment claim. GTAA's counsel objected. GTAA was not put on notice of this and I indicated I would not allow the Complainant to do indirectly what she could not do directly. This case was always presented as one of a section 7 violation only; the Respondent did not receive reasonable notice. For natural justice reasons, no allegations of harassment will be considered against the Respondent.\nD. Allegation #1: S.M. Took Away Her Work and Gave It to B.M. and M.G. [48] This was a major part of Ms. Fahmy's Complaint. Ms. Fahmy says she was the technical lead of the Windows 2000 project at first, that her core duties were taken away from her, and given to two white, male consultants - B.M. and M.G. - who were less qualified than she. She claims that, as a consequence, she was relegated to less important duties. To deal with this allegation, I must examine exactly what her job was at GTAA.\n[49] Ms. Fahmy was hired as a network analyst. Technical lead was not the job title. Within the job description, she could be assigned various projects at the discretion of her manager, such as that of technical lead. A position vacancy notice and a job analysis data document outlining the job requirements and duties for a network analyst by GTAA were entered into evidence. Ms. Fahmy said they were applicable to her with some modifications. It included any assignments given to her by her manager. In her reply to GTAA's response to the Commission, she wrote: The position is strictly Windows 2000\/NT implementation and support. Her major duty, according to her, S.M., A.W. and M.G., was to be technical lead for the Windows 2000 project, migrating data and users from Windows NT to Windows 2000. This was the biggest and most expensive project in the IT department at the time. D.L. was the project manager and D.M. was the architect. Ms. Fahmy was to work closely with D.M.\n[50] To have a better understanding of what her job was, let us examine what Ms. Fahmy wrote describing her job in her curriculum vitae post-GTAA employment at p. 2:\nGreater Toronto Airport Authority July 2002-May 2003\nSenior Network Analyst\nPlanned\/implemented Active Directory Services and Windows 2000 Advanced servers' rollout.\nMaintained\/monitored 72 NT\/2000 servers including DHCP, WINS and DDNS.\nConfigured Vlans and port security on Cisco switches 1900, 2900 and 3500 series.\nMaintained Exchange 5.5 server and Exchange 2000.\nImplemented SMS 2.0 and SQL 2000 server.\nProvide backup for RSASecurID.\nInvolved in the computer's room layout and prepared all purchased cabinets and servers.\n[51] The above job duties in her own written words belie her Complaint and testimony that her job was reduced, and part of her duties given to others, leaving her in a lesser role. She writes that she Planned\/implemented Active Directory Services and Windows 2000 Advanced servers' rollout. These are the technical lead duties which she both initially claimed she wasn't getting credit for by D.M. and V.J., and then later after it was apparent the system architecture didn't work and needed to be replaced or fixed, that she wasn't at all responsible, because the work was taken away from her. In her c.v. above, she conveniently doesn't mention that the rollout of the Windows 2000 system that she [p]lanned\/implemented was a failure.\n[52] Throughout the hearing, there was confusion as to exactly what Ms. Fahmy's role was, including the nomenclature - technical lead, primary, senior, and coordinator. I accept the evidence that technical lead and primary were interchangeable. The term senior was used by different witnesses to mean: longest tenured, most knowledgeable, lead. Senior network analyst is also a term of art in the industry and indeed is a separate classification under the collective agreement at the GTAA. A.W., who came into the picture in January 2003 to deal with the W2000 system design and implementation problems, said the Complainant was the senior windows technical resource on the W2000 project. S.M. testified that she was the coordinator for Windows 2000 for his department: the senior, primary. He averred: The overall coordinating responsibility belonged to D.M. and D.L. ... She was the only permanent resource on the team [for the Windows 2000 project]. It was always her. It was never taken away; even to the last day, she was the main person responsible, even though I had concerns about her performance. He also said B.M. and M.G. were originally brought in to assist her as it was a big project.\n[53] Her contradictory testimony about her role and responsibilities is evident in these exchanges between her and Ms. Rusak:\nQ. ...you said that you misunderstood because you thought you were the senior on Windows 2000.\nA. When I was hired - yes, I'm not a senior with a title, but I am in charge of making sure that things go right with Windows 2000. And if there was a problem I fixed it.\nQ. ...You weren't hired as a senior, however you were trying to assume the role of a senior.\nA. I am not assuming the role...I know my Windows 2000 at the level of senior, yes. I'm not a senior. I just know my stuff as a senior...I'm the only one in charge. Only one person. And I was allowed to fix errors done by other people. So this is my responsibility. If they do a problem I fix it. So this is most knowledgeable person of Windows.\n... ...\nQ. So you're saying that as the technical lead you couldn't determine who, to use your terminology, screwed up the systems, because there were too many people using the system.\n... ...\nA. I'm not the technical lead. I wasn't totally technical lead.\nQ. You said you were the technical lead. I asked if you were the technical lead on the W2K project, you said yes. Now you're not the technical lead.\nA. No. I am not the technical -- my problem is [S.M.] undermined me and he did not want me to -- he didn't respect my knowledge, so I wasn't the technical lead. I supposed to, but I wasn't.\n[54] S.M. testified that: Her job was to understand what was being built so she could support it and accept the system on behalf of the department and then support it. In his email to Ms. Fahmy dated November 12, 2002 (after she received her first performance appraisal and replied that she was unclear as to her role), S.M. outlined her responsibilities:\n... ...\nYou are assigned to the Windows 2000 project team. The team is being managed by [D.L. and D.M.]. Your primary role (as always) was to assist with the building and rollout of the W2K technology while becoming our department's expert in the area of administration and future growth (design) of the W2K technology.\nI [sic] other words, continue to support the W2K team and make sure you understand how W2K was setup at L.B.P.I.A. Once the W2K environment is fully in production, you will be the main administrator for W2K in our group. [M.G.] will be your backup and should be involved in all W2K issues. Outside of this role, I expect that you continue to support any other production issues that might arise that do not impact you [sic] role on the W2K project. I also expect you to continue to respond to any pager calls you receive.\nI expect you to continue to contribute to the team and offer your ideas and suggestions when problems arise.\n... ...\n[55] Several comments flow from the above email. First, I find it accurately reflected her role as of November 12, 2002. Second, her manager is clear in his expectations and in his communication of them to Ms. Fahmy.\n[56] S.M. gave testimony that following the sending of the above November 12th email to Ms. Fahmy in response to her saying she was confused about her role, she replied, Thank you for the update. She was not confused as to her role and responsibilities. However, he stated: One day, she understands it; a week later, she's confused again. I have to send her an email. It happened four or more times; she needed constant feedback. He later said that he never had to manage an employee or contractor so much.\n[57] The Minutes of the July 17, 2002 meeting regarding the Windows 2000 Network Infrastructure Design, attended by D.M., Imran Asmal and the Complainant and copied to D.L. and S.M. stated: Future management of the project will be based on equal participation of the three core team members [three attendees]. The Minutes were recorded by Ms. Fahmy.\n[58] Having examined the evidence in detail, I find that she was originally hired as a network analyst with the main responsibility of being the technical lead for the W2000 project, run by D.L. and D.M. Ms. Fahmy would have other duties and tasks assigned to her from time to time, but the W2000 project was to occupy most of her time. Consistent with this are the notes that confirm that S.M. had to tell her to stay focused on the W2000 project and not worry about other work projects. Ms. Fahmy's email to S.M. dated September 6, 2002 complaining that D.M. and V.J. were not sharing any of the credit for the build with her confirms her key role in the project: My help was totally denied and forgotten. I note that in the email, she sets out her role in the project which shows that she was integral to the build process. Ms. Fahmy is also very critical of D.M.'s work in that email. Indeed, in that same email, she wrote in bold, [D.M.] didn't have any experience with W2K Domain Migration. He said it clearly when we started this project. Now you call him the expert and I am the one who is learning. Whether she was right or not, this confirms S.M.'s evidence about her constantly challenging D.M. and not accepting his role. Interestingly, when the project looked successful, she was not denying her involvement or role and was complaining about the lack of credit being given to her. However, when it later became apparent that the system-build was a failure and would require an expensive fix or complete rebuild, she changed her tune. She downplayed the importance of her role and stated that she had no decision-making power.\n[59] While I accept the Complainant was originally hired to be the technical lead or primary on the W2000 project, I do not find that she discharged that function to the end of her employment on May 1, 2003. I don't accept S.M.'s evidence on this point. In that regard, I accept the evidence of A.W. and S.G. when they testified that the people associated with the unsuccessful first W2000 system-build were tarnished with its failure. Many of them were no longer there in February 2003 when GTAA hired a well-respected Microsoft expert to find out what went wrong and make recommendations. The Microsoft Report, which was released on February 28, 2003, was a devastating condemnation of the system designed and built by the D.L.\/D.M.\/V.J.\/Fahmy team.6 Ms. Fahmy was not one of the major players let go. I should add that GTAA stipulates, and S.M. stated this in his testimony, that the MS Report and Ms. Fahmy's role in the unsuccessful W2000 infrastructure build and implementation played no role in his decision to end her employment. While I believe this was not an explicit reason, I find that she was tainted by her involvement and association with the project as technical lead, as S.G. testified. This tainting, along with her other work and negative interactions with S.M., led to his losing confidence and trust in her abilities, and some of her responsibilities being taken away (i.e., technical lead on the W2000 project).\n[60] As well, it is natural that S.M., being a new manager, would want to bring in new people, especially after such a disaster, financial and time-wise. Further, I note the email from S.G. to M.G., and copied to Ms. Fahmy dated March 18, 2003 recapping this morning's meeting among S.M., S.G. and M.G. In that email, S.G. confirms that it was decided that M.G. would be the Primary or technical lead and Ms. Fahmy the Secondary for the Administration and Support of WINS [Enterprise W2000 system].\n[61] I find that B.M. and M.G. were not brought in to replace Ms. Fahmy, as she claims. They were there originally to assist her in this major project in the fall of 2002. As well, M.G. was to be her back-up. I accept the evidence of M.G. and A.W. that it was standard practice and common sense to have a back-up for each technical lead or primary in case something happens to that person, they're on vacation, become ill, etc. A.W. testified that, ...in January, February, she was still technical lead and it was a major undertaking for one person. However, when it became apparent that the system was not working, the major people involved were tarnished - D.L., D.M. and Ms. Fahmy. It was a credibility smasher. Along with the issues of bad attitude and insubordinate\/unprofessional behaviour by Ms. Fahmy in the eyes of S.M. (e.g., always challenging him and D.M., the November 13th door closing-opening incident in S.M.'s office, walking out on him during the November 8th meeting, etc.), I believe that S.M. decided to lessen her duties as the technical lead in the W2000 project. By the end of February 2003, with the Terminal 1 deadline fast approaching, and the Microsoft Report in, a decision had been made by those above S.M. to re-build the W2000 system, at a great monetary cost. I do not believe that S.M. had the confidence in Ms. Fahmy to leave her as the technical lead for the system-rebuild. S.G., A.W. and M.G. would be the major players in the new Enterprise W2000 project. She was technical lead in name only for the first W2000 project from March 2003 to the end of her employment.\n[62] While I find that, as of approximately March 2003, she was technical lead for the inoperative first W2000 project in name only and not the new Enterprise W2000 project, I do not see any liability under the CHRA attaching for several reasons. First and foremost, the decision was not related to any of the prohibited grounds claimed by Ms. Fahmy. It was based on her involvement in the unsuccessful first W2000 project, her inconsistent work performance and her personality conflict with her manager, S.M. Second, she did bear some responsibility for the first W2000 system's failure, along with D.L. as project manager and D.M. as the architect. Third, she was given additional important duties to fulfill such as purchasing equipment and doing the inventory. She also provided user support and responded to Heat tickets. As well, she was offered work at the Terminal 1 building construction site by S.M. and she turned it down. B.M. ended up being assigned the task. It is important to remember that she was hired as a network analyst, and that was what she was to the last day of her employment at GTAA. Her job description provided for flexibility in terms of assignments, as many jobs in workplaces do. As there were several network analysts working in IT Systems Operations and with overlapping duties, it is not surprising that management would juggle assignments among them.\n[63] With regards to the role of B.M. and M.G., I do not find that they replaced her. They had similar roles, but there were differences too. M.G. became the coordinator for the second W2000 project (Enterprise) in March 2003. He was promoted the following month by Gary Long on April 28th to coordinating the day to day Systems Operations activities while [S.M.] is focusing on the terminal. S.M. was still in charge of IT Systems Operations, but was essentially working out of the Terminal 1 construction site. I do find that the primary role on the W2000 system project was taken away from her and given to M.G. on the Enterprise system - the successor to the failed first system-build. According to the March 18, 2003 confirmatory email from S.G., it was decided that Ms. Fahmy would become the secondary for the Administration and Support of WINS. I find that this amounted to adverse differential treatment. However, I also find that the decision was not based on any prohibited ground of discrimination claimed by Ms. Fahmy. Accordingly, there is no violation of subsection 7(b) of the CHRA here.\n[64] Ms. Fahmy alleges that the Pre-Production Centre (PPC) work was taken away from her and given to B.M. I heard evidence that S.M. originally assigned Ms. Fahmy the coordination of the PPC work. However, S.M. testified that the project was late for many reasons. He asked Ms. Fahmy if she needed more resources. He averred that she said she was getting by. Later, she agreed to bring someone else in to assist - B.M. S.M. stated that in October more work came in and she agreed to have B.M. do it. S.M. advised the IT group in an email on November 13, 2002 that, [B.M.] will schedule and coordinate IT System Operations activities related to the PPC. The need for the PPC testing facility grew so S.M. eventually hired and dedicated a permanent resource to handle the work, David Piatek. Ms. Fahmy disputed S.M.'s version of these events; in particular, she said that she neither was consulted in advance nor agreed to B.M. taking over her role as coordinator of the PPC work.\n[65] I find that the work was initially assigned to her, but it wasn't getting done on time and more resources were required; hence, B.M. being brought in to assist. I also find that S.M. subsequently decided to reassign the coordinator's role for the PPC to B.M. and then later, to have the work done by Mr. Piatek. The foregoing may well constitute adverse differentiation of Ms. Fahmy. However, I find no nexus between the decision to initially bring in B.M. to assist and then take on the coordinating role for the PPC work, and any of the prohibited grounds of discrimination claimed by Ms. Fahmy. They were legitimate business decisions on the part of S.M.\n[66] I wish to add that, on another occasion, S.M. took away work from Imran Asmal and reassigned it to Ms. Fahmy. Mr. Asmal was not happy about this decision.\n[67] In the hearing and in her documentation, Ms. Fahmy alleges that not only did B.M. and M.G. replace her, but they were less than qualified to do so. It was challenged by S.M. As well, A.W., who was described as well respected in the IT field and senior by S.M., said that B.M. was a superstar and that many people sought his assistance. M.G.'s abilities were also lauded. He was promoted three times since he first joined GTAA. Indeed, at one point, Ms. Fahmy testified that, As long as he [M.G.] is not touching my job he is qualified. That suggests that she was less than sincere in her earlier assertions about their competence. Even D.M., who was predisposed to Ms. Fahmy in his testimony, stated that he saw no real difference in terms of technical competence among Ms. Fahmy, B.M. and M.G. I find that B.M. and M.G. were qualified to do the jobs GTAA hired them to do and assigned to them during that period.\nE. Allegation #2: The September 3 or 4 Conversation Between S.M. and Ms. Fahmy [68] Ms. Fahmy testified that S.M. told her to leave the W2000 system-build to V.J., an IT consultant who worked on the project and D.M., the architect who was responsible for the design of the infrastructure. When questioned by her, S.M. allegedly said, Are you challenging me? You're on probation. S.M. says Ms. Fahmy was repeatedly challenging the authority and decisions of D.M. and V.J. He said D.M. repeatedly complained to him about this. This was not corroborated by D.M. in his testimony. S.M. averred that he simply told her to let them do their jobs. I accept S.M.'s evidence on this point. He denies the part about saying, Are you challenging me. You're on probation. I do not believe he made that statement.\n[69] With regard to Ms. Fahmy constantly challenging D.M.'s role and decisions, perhaps in a way she was right. The first design and build for the Windows 2000 project was unsuccessful. However, she never brought this to the attention of S.M. at any stage. Indeed, during cross-examination, she at first refused to even agree that the first build was a failure. She eventually agreed. I believe she was resistant because of her involvement and association with the unsuccessful project. Or perhaps it was due to the strategy she was advised to adopt and that she set out in her September 6th email to S.M. complaining about not being given credit for her work in the W2000 project by D.M. and V.J.:\nI would like Gary Long to know what my role in W2K was.\nFirst I recall that I did have a similar problem at Nortel Networks. A co-worker advised me to do the following:\n1. Not to be pro-active.\n2. Let problems first escalate to top management, and then solve them. Everyone would learn that you resolved these problems. You would get noticed and you would be like a hero.\n[Her bolding.]\nOf course, it didn't turn out that way. She didn't resolve the problems and she was associated with the failing project.\n[70] By way of the prohibited ground of sex only, the Complainant argues that on September 3 or 4, 2002, S.M. made certain sexist comments. First, he said he didn't see many women in the IT field, and there were few in his graduating class. He allegedly said, It's a man's world, let the man win. Notwithstanding the comments appear in her Complaint as having been made on the same day, in the hearing Ms. Fahmy testified that they occurred on two separate occasions. I didn't separate them [allegations] by dates when I made my Complaint. S.M. admits to the first comment (i.e., lack of women in IT and his class). They are simply factual statements and certainly do not trigger liability under the CHRA. He denies the latter statements. I accept his testimony.\n[71] During the hearing, the Complainant testified that when she joined GTAA, she was told that [S.M.] doesn't like non-white people and all the people hired were white. This is hearsay evidence at its worst: no names, just pejorative, damaging accusations being made. Ms. Fahmy was reluctant to name those individuals. Her counsel stipulated that, The people that she has named and who will be called as witnesses will testify to what they told her of their views and -- of their views and how they came to those views, so we're content to rely on that and not to rely on the Complainant's evidence that there were other unnamed individuals who gave her their opinions as well. However, not one witness corroborated this hearsay statement about S.M. not liking non-whites. I give this evidence no weight and reject it. Regarding only white people being hired, this is not true, and indeed white employees were not all kept on. There is no pattern of discriminatory hiring and firing practices by S.M. Indeed, the majority of employees in his department were people of colour. Counsel for the Complainant did not argue there was a systemic discriminatory hiring pattern here.\n[72] I also heard evidence that Ms. Fahmy was the only female employee under S.M.'s supervision. Again, Ms. MacKinnon does not submit that there is a hiring pattern per se that constitutes a discriminatory practice. The fact that Ms. Fahmy was the only woman under S.M.'s supervision does not prove anything discriminatory per se. I have reviewed the evidence to determine if her being the only woman resulted in her being treated differently in a negative way. I don't find that to be the case.\n[73] I would like to comment on the testimony of one of the Complainant's witnesses, Ozgur Erkucuk. He worked as a network analyst with Ms. Fahmy. Like her, he is a person of colour and was a unionized employee. He later returned there as a consultant and currently reports to M.G. He testified that the GTAA workplace was multi-cultural and multi-racial. While he could not remember some of the statements he allegedly made to the Commission investigator, he was clear in his viva voce evidence. He testified that he did not hear or see anything that suggested the Complainant was discriminated against based on the prohibited grounds she claimed. He said it is true that she was the only woman in S.M.'s IT group. He also stated that it was understandable for a new manager, who doesn't know his employees' skills and performance levels, to bring in new people. Ms. MacKinnon insinuates in argument that the witness perjured himself. I note that she did not attempt to have him declared a hostile witness. While his evidence was undoubtedly not what the Complainant had hoped for (he was their witness), I find Mr. Erkucuk was a credible witness and I accept his evidence above. He was not able to corroborate any adverse differential treatment of Ms. Fahmy based on the claimed grounds under the CHRA.\n[74] I do believe the Complainant was a challenge for S.M. to manage, and he did not like her challenging his authority. I note that he complained about S.G. doing this, going over his head, etc. Perhaps as a new manager, S.M. was sensitive to employees\/contractors challenging him. It appears the more Ms. Fahmy questioned him about things, such as why he was extending her probationary period, the more impatient he became. It's a fine line between questioning and challenging. I also believe that Ms. Fahmy's obsessive, constant haranguing of S.M. (e.g., by sending numerous emails on a single day on one issue and approaching him in person), who was extremely busy and away from the office often at meetings, got on his nerves. However, I don't see any connection based on the claimed prohibited grounds. Indeed, S.M. dealt with women in other departments at GTAA, including Maria Maack, and with a range of people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. I accept Ms. Maack's evidence that there have been no complaints about S.M., other than Ms. Fahmy's, concerning his treatment and relationships with women or people of colour.\nF. Allegation #3: Issue of Accents and Communication Level of Employees [75] This allegation deals with the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, and colour. Ms. Fahmy claims that, in the late summer of 2002, she overheard a conversation between S.M. and D.M. whereby S.M. allegedly remarked, I only want people who could communicate at a certain level. She claims he said he needs to hire more senior people that can communicate at my level. The Complainant testified that it was only said about non-white IT workers and that S.M. had a problem with accents. I note that Ms. Fahmy admitted that she never actually heard S.M. say he had problems with accents, only that he wanted better communication. D.M., who was the person to whom S.M. allegedly made the comment, testified that he remembered discussing separately with D.L. and S.M. the issue as to whether Ms. Fahmy could communicate at the appropriate technical level on projects. The discussions were about Ms. Fahmy, and not general in nature, which I interpret to mean they were not about other people. He didn't mention anything about accents. S.M. denied saying what Ms. Fahmy alleges. He said his only comment was that he wanted everyone, including clients, to communicate effectively in their emails. It had nothing to do with accents. I accept his explanation. S.M.'s testimony is more consistent with D.M.'s evidence. Ms. Fahmy also stated that S.M. only hired white contractors without accents. This is not so: for example, S.M. rehired Ozgur Erkucuk, who has an accent.\n[76] In her reply to GTAA's response to the Commission, she wrote: Two staff members said that he criticized our accents. They were very upset. She did not name the individuals. I accord no weight to this evidence.\nG. Allegation #4: Security Clearance [77] Ms. Fahmy asserts that she was delayed in starting her employment by two months because she was not given the proper security clearance. She says white contractors were allowed to start immediately without the clearance (i.e., B.M. and M.G.). Maria Maack and S.M. testified that this was a requirement for all employees in every department at GTAA, given the nature of the work at the airport. Sometimes an independent contractor could begin work immediately with restricted access. It depended on the circumstances. Employees needed to get the security clearance. I accept this explanation and fail to see any nexus between the practice and a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nH. Allegation #5: Security Gateway and Other Training [78] The Complainant alleges that she requested and was denied training for Internet Security Gateway and it was a pattern. The white contractors got training, while she and the other people of colour did not. S.M. testified that both Param Singh, a Senior Network Analyst and Ozgur Erkucuk, a full time employee of Turkish ancestry, received the training as they were the primary and secondary respectively for the I.S.G. No one else had access. As well, Ms. Maack testified that an employer is not obligated to provide training to a probationary employee, beyond what is required for their job. I have no evidence before me about whether she was treated any differently than other probationary employees, if any, under S.M's supervision. S.M. testified that race played no part in his decision as to who got what training. Indeed, some of the most expensive training went to contractors\/employees of colour. I accept the above evidence of GTAA. I see no adverse differential treatment and certainly none tied to a prohibited ground of discrimination under the CHRA.\nI. Allegation #6: S.M. Excluded Her From Meetings [79] Ms. Fahmy claims that S.M. excluded her from meetings. She had difficulty providing detailed examples; her testimony focused on a January 30, 2003 meeting. She testified that she knew M.G. was going to meetings she should have been at because she could see notations of meetings on his desk. She averred: Meetings were behind my back about Windows 2000 so I did not know when [they took place]. She acknowledged, in cross-examination, the September 11, 2003 e-mail she sent to D.M. (entered into evidence) to help her remember the date of the Windows 2000 meeting she was excluded from: I need to use it as an example of excluding me from Windows 2000 meetings. D.M. replied that, as far as he could remember, the meeting took place at the very end of January. I find that the January 30, 2003 meeting was the only one from which she was excluded, and for legitimate and non-CHRA reasons, as will be addressed below.\n[80] The January 30th meeting was called by S.M.'s boss, Gary Long, to discuss the problems with the first W2000 system, including the crashing and major outages. It was of great concern to GTAA. I accept S.M.'s evidence that Mr. Long determined who would attend. Given the discussion would be very critical of the system-build, it was thought that the two major people involved, D.M. and Ms. Fahmy, would not be present. I accept the evidence of A.W. that he didn't want it to turn into a shouting match and blaming exercise. He asked Ms. Fahmy to stay behind to monitor the centre and any emergencies by users. It was a mandatory requirement that someone always be present in the control centre at IT. D.M. was not invited either. Unfortunately, he crashed the meeting. I am satisfied that Ms. Fahmy was not unfairly excluded from this meeting, but if she was, it was not connected to a prohibited ground of discrimination. Ms. Fahmy has not established on a prima facie basis that she was kept out of any other meetings and if so, that said action was linked to a prohibited ground.\nJ. Allegation #7: Access to the Campus Area Network [81] The Complainant alleges that she was denied access to the Campus Area Network (CAN), but B.M. and M.G. were not. This prevented her from doing her job sometimes. Both S.M. and A.W. said she did not need access to CAN to do her job. S.M. averred that B.M. and M.G. weren't given access initially either. Later they were because S.M. was moving over in February-March onsite to Terminal 1 and they needed access to CAN. M.G. testified that B.M. was working on the T1 project and required access and M.G. was his back-up when B.M. went on vacation, etc. and thus, he too required access. We wanted to keep tight control on access to CAN. This came from both Bell Canada and GTAA. I accept the explanation given by GTAA and do not find any engagement of section 7 of the CHRA here.\nK. Allegation #8: CD Cabinet Key [82] Ms. Fahmy testified that at one point the cabinet containing the CDs of all departments was locked and she wasn't given a key, and this prevented her from doing some of her tasks. She wrote, Later, [M.G.] put a new lock on the cabinet and he gave the key to [B.M.], Calvin Ni [a person of colour] and kept one for himself. S.M. denied this, testifying: Everyone had access to the Cabinet with the CDs. The custodian was Vishwa [Surajram, a database administrator and senior person]. The key was in the top drawer. Everyone knew that. She could have accessed it. CAN and the CD key were never raised as issues prior to this hearing. Even if Ms. Fahmy was not aware the key was in the top drawer readily accessible, I find no connection between this and section 7 of the CHRA.\nL. Allegation #9: Sexual Comments About Ms. Fahmy at Two Meetings [83] This was the most serious allegation. It emanated from S.G., who joined GTAA in January 2003. He was on contract from MicroAge Consultants. He was technical project manager and senior solutions architect for the W2000 Enterprise project. Ms. Fahmy learned about these alleged comments in general terms from S.G. following her employment termination.\n[84] The allegation from S.G. at the time he testified was different from what he had told the Commission investigator some two years earlier. Differences are also apparent from his emails to and from Ms. Fahmy prior to the hearing. I should add that the emails were from Ms. Fahmy asking S.G. to assist at the hearing. She appears to be coaching him as to what to say, going over specific issues and what his response might be. He indicated to her that he would only tell the truth and that I am not sure how I can help since I did not get to work with you very much and can't really speak to your technical abilities.\n[85] Regarding the degrading sexual comments, in one undated email replying to Ms. Fahmy's email to him, S.G. wrote: ...I was also disgusted by his [S.M.'s] level of unprofessionalism and his sexist attitude when it came to discussing you. I will not repeat some of the things he said when I met with him in his office, but I can tell you that between him, [M.G. and A.W.], their discussion about women disgusted me. Although there is a reference to discussing you meaning Ms. Fahmy, he then says their discussion was about women, not specifically about Ms. Fahmy.\n[86] At the hearing, S.G. testified that there were two distinct incidents, both in S.M.'s office. He said there were probably more but he couldn't recall. At both meetings in February-March 2003, S.M., A.W. and he were present. He wasn't too sure if M.G. was present at either meeting. I find it odd that he wouldn't remember more about such meetings or have taken some action. He says he was shocked and in his email disgusted, yet he was almost condoning what was allegedly said by not leaving the meetings and\/or reporting them. In an incident involving an employee who played a joke on someone else's computer pretending he was that person and gay, when A.W. learned of it, he quickly reported it to S.M. The latter reacted promptly and made the offending individual apologize both in writing and verbally.\n[87] S.G. testified that, at one of the two meetings, ...I remember one of the comments was she [Ms. Fahmy] would be less uptight if she got it more often... They didn't use that word, but I'll use that word. He said the words were more blunt. The witness did not recall who said it. He thinks there were laughter and chuckles. At the other meeting, S.G. averred that a comment was made about how well she [Ms. Fahmy] performed fellatio. The exact words were more graphic. Again, he thinks there was laughter and he's not sure who said it.\n[88] Later in his testimony, he became clearer:\nI don't know who actually said those comments. My guess is the conversation would have started with [A.W.]. Who made the comments I don't know. My guess is it started with [A.W.] but I don't know...I simply speculate based on the fact that every time he [A.W.] was around there was always a conversation that somehow had something to do with sex.\nAs I indicated earlier, the relationship between S.G. and A.W. was visceral. A.W. testified with candour, We hate each other.\n[89] S.G. was cross-examined on numerous prior inconsistent statements. He was asked why he didn't tell the same story that he told the Tribunal to the Commission investigator two years earlier, when his memory was much better. He testified: ...I don't generally speak to women in that type of language and, like I said, I didn't know who this person was...I also appreciate the fact that it was a phone interview with a woman that I had never talked to and I didn't even know if she was from the Human Rights Commission. Well, she called and said she was, but I don't believe anything at face value over the phone. Ms. Rusak then responded, So you proceeded to tell her all this information about the GTAA and about [S.M.]. You're now saying that you talked to a woman that you didn't know [was a Commission investigator], you thought she may be, but maybe not, and you're just blurting all this stuff out?...But you divulged. You said you didn't use obscenities. You said a good fuck. That's an obscenity... S.G. admitted to being more graphic with the Commission investigator. Ms. Rusak was also able to elicit from the witness that he didn't say anything about fellatio to the Commission investigator.\n[90] Further inconsistencies were revealed in the following exchange between Ms. Rusak and the witness:\nQ. You're identifying one person, you're not taking a broad-brush approach. You're not saying [A.W.] may have said this. You actually never said to her, And by the way, [A.W.], any time he's around it's always sort of that kind [of] conversation. You didn't tell her that, did you?\nA. No, probably not.\nQ. And you identified [S.M.] as saying certain things, but certainly not the way you represented them yesterday when you said two comments were made specifically with respect to the complainant, but you don't remember who it was. That's different, isn't it?\nA. It is different. But like I said, that's four years ago.\n[91] The foregoing testimony is strikingly unbelievable. I give it no weight. It is also surprising that, if these comments had been made, he didn't leave the office, he didn't complain about them, and he only told Ms. Fahmy after she left the GTAA. This was also after S.G. ended his relationship with GTAA and MicroAge (with whom he was contracted), and he was angry at the GTAA (and A.W. and S.M.). In addition to A.W.'s testimony about his relationship with S.G., I accept S.M.'s testimony that his relationship with S.G. was poor, and that he was difficult to manage.\n[92] In cross-examination, S.G. testified that at the time he spoke to the Commission investigator he thought it was S.M. who made the comments. Now years later, I don't know. Ms. Rusak put it to him, Then you said it was [S.M.]. Later you tried to expand the net because the Complainant told you the decision-maker was [A.W.], not [S.M.]. He replied, That is news to me...I can say that [M.G.] was generally reserved and quiet in those kind of conversations...That's why I said I don't know if it was [S.M.], I don't know if it was [A.W.]. I can tell you it was not [M.G.].\n[93] S.M., A.W. and M.G. denied these comments outright. S.M. and A.W. could not remember if the two meetings among the four of them even took place. M.G. was asked if he was ever present in a meeting with S.G., S.M. and A.W. He answered, Possibly... one time for sure. When asked in cross-examination if he would agree that if made, these comments would be offensive, A.W. replied, Not only sexist, but disgraceful and repugnant. Each of them testified that they had never heard sexist comments or seen sexist behaviour exhibited by the others. S.G., A.W. and M.G. were examined and cross-examined on these two alleged incidents. S.M. was examined, but not cross-examined about the two alleged meetings in his office. I also heard evidence that S.M. never made jokes of any type. Mr. Surajram testified that not only did he never hear S.M. make a sexist or racist comment or act in such a manner, he added that he never even heard him make a joke. A.W. said, I don't think [S.M.] even knows how to tell a joke. I was most troubled by S.G.'s evidence that it was common when A.W. was around for the conversation to degenerate into sexual banter. Based on S.G.'s inconsistencies about these incidents and his and A.W.'s poor relationship, I do not find that A.W. made those comments.\n[94] Based on my findings above and my earlier comments about S.G.'s credibility, and the unequivocal denial by S.M., A.W. and M.G. (tested or able to be tested in cross-examination), I am not prepared to find on the sole basis of S.G.'s testimony that such degrading sexual comments were made about Ms. Fahmy in those two alleged incidents.\nM. Allegation #10: Her Work Performance Was Good: Her Employment Termination was Discriminatory [95] Ms. Fahmy claims that her work performance was good and that her employment was terminated because she is a woman of colour of Egyptian origin. GTAA counters, indicating that while her performance was satisfactory at times, it was not consistently of a good enough quality for her to be retained.\n[96] The decision to terminate her employment was officially that of Gary Long, S.M.'s boss. Being a contractor, S.M. was not permitted to officially hire or terminate people's employment; notwithstanding, he signed her performance appraisals and letter of termination. He recommended to Mr. Long that her probationary employment be terminated effective May 1, 2003 - 10 months after she began working at GTAA. S.M. said he consulted A.W. S.M. was away onsite at the Terminal 1 building most of the time from March 2003 onward. S.M. was also influenced by the complaints on April 29th and May 1st from M.G. and B.M. respectively about her work. He was concerned too about Vishwa Surajram, a senior person at GTAA and Lynn Child, a systems administrator, having complained about Ms. Fahmy's work and not wanting her to work on their equipment in the future. S.M. was also concerned about the issue of Ms. Fahmy taking easier and fewer Heat tickets.\n[97] A.W. testified that from his perspective, the triggering event was that people didn't want Ms. Fahmy to work on their equipment or do work for them; the RFC (request for change) issues; and the inventory taking longer than expected. I escalated these issues to my supervisor, [S.M.] A.W. denies that he was asked to concoct reasons to justify terminating her employment. A.W. stated: If so, I would have nit-picked on everything. She was already on probation and we weren't seeing anything getting better. In the May 1, 2003 termination meeting, S.M. did indicate to her that she had done good work, but that it wasn't consistently of a satisfactory quality. As well, he mentioned that her Microsoft Exchange skills were poor. The May 1st letter of termination says in part:\nAlthough some improvement was noted for a period of a month, that improvement has not been consistent nor has it been on a continuous basis. In reviewing all your work from December 18, 2002 to the present, it is with regret that we find that you do not meet the requirements of the job as you have demonstrated weak technical skills and little or no understanding of your position's role and responsibilities.\n[98] GTAA stipulates that Ms. Fahmy had done good work. I reviewed the exhibits that spoke to this fact: e.g., emails from S.M. to her; and emails from clients thanking her for her work. The issue has always been the same: one of inconsistency. Aside from the one month period from November 12-December 17, 2002 when the second and last formal appraisal noting her improvement came out, GTAA says her performance was not consistently at a satisfactory standard. S.M. testified that he had prepared a performance appraisal in April 2003 (not entered into evidence), but it was never given to her because the decision was made to terminate her employment at the end of April.\n(i) Was She Competent and Qualified to Do the Job? [99] S.M. testified: On paper [she was qualified]; in the end based on results [over the ten months], she was not qualified. I so find. On paper she had the qualifications to be a network analyst at GTAA. She graduated with an engineering degree from Cairo University, she had certifications from Microsoft and a number of years' experience in the IT field in Canada (notwithstanding my finding about her misrepresentations on her curriculum vitae). Obviously GTAA agreed; they hired her. I also find that she demonstrated while working at GTAA a degree of technical knowledge and competence. However, competence includes other factors such as an ability to perform consistently at a proficient level. And performing and doing your job also include not just technical knowledge, but a positive attitude and cooperative approach to your supervisor and co-workers. In these areas she was lacking. In this regard, I accept A.W.'s testimony that he had a conversation with Ms. Fahmy in the cafeteria at the end of January 2003 about her autocratic style whereby he urged her to be more effective and less argumentative. He also stated: She wanted more projects. She wanted to be in charge of everything, and the other guys to do the mundane stuff...I told her by getting along better with people that would make her more effective. Ms. Fahmy denies this conversation.\n[100] Based on the testimony I heard from S.M. and the documentary evidence I have reviewed, I find that S.M. was consistent in advising Ms. Fahmy that her work was not consistently of a satisfactory standard. This included not just technical concerns, such as the RFC issue and the missed deadlines, but attitudinal concerns too (e.g., November 13th incident in his office, the constant challenging of D.M. and S.M.), and the issue of her requiring so much supervision and management. Ms. Maack testified that the Complainant was very high maintenance. S.M. testified that he has never since Ms. Fahmy had to spend so much time managing an employee. More management was required of her than normal for a probationary employee. I have indicated earlier in my Reasons my views that some of her behaviour was clearly unprofessional.\n[101] It is clear from the evidence, as stated in the termination letter, that Ms. Fahmy did not understand her role and responsibilities. The emails between her and S.M. show this, including the one from S.M. dated November 12, 2002 where he reiterates her responsibilities, and the one from her that generated S.M.'s response.\n[102] I also find part of the problem was that Ms. Fahmy had a rather unrealistic view of her work performance. In an email to GTAA President Turpen dated May 4, 2003, she wrote: After that [extension of her probationary period]7 he [S.M.] stopped giving me any projects because he found me too successful and he received much e-mail from customers thanking me for a good job. In a letter she writes that S.M. worried I was too successful. She also wrote that her work was perfect. Clearly this wasn't the case. Even if I accept half of the assertions of technical mistakes about her work, and don't even factor in the inappropriate behaviour toward S.M., she was assuredly not too successful and her work was far from perfect. Coupled with this assessment of her work was her inability to take direction from her supervisors on a consistent basis. I accept the evidence of S.M. that D.M. complained many times to him about what could be characterized as her insubordination and constant challenging of D.M.'s authority and decisions. This is believable given her email to S.M. dated September 6, 2002 where she was highly critical of D.M.'s work. In the Minutes of the November 13th meeting (with S.M., Ms. Maack and Ms. Erbiceanu of human resources, Ms. Fahmy and union representative Mark Daniels) at p. 4, Ms. Maack cautioned Ms. Fahmy that she was not the project lead: D.M. was the architect; and she wasn't a Senior Network Analyst; she was a Network Analyst. The above factors into one of the reasons the GTAA gave for her employment termination: she didn't understand her role and responsibilities.\n[103] Finally, while I find Ms. Fahmy has technical knowledge and IT training and education, her comportment was less than professional, specifically toward S.M. First, I heard evidence regarding her following S.M. around demanding that he meet with her regarding her November 8th negative performance appraisal, notwithstanding a follow-up meeting had been set to take place in the near future. Ms. Fahmy wrote in her reply to GTAA's response to the Commission: He walked to his desk and I followed him. Then I insisted to know whether [M.G.] would be my replacement, I just could not let it go.8 Her insistence culminated on November 13, 2002 with her coming to his office and closing the door, his opening it, her closing it, his opening it, etc. He had to raise his voice and direct her to leave his office. He testified that he was scared, not knowing what she was capable of doing or saying. He immediately called his wife and then human resources, wanting to meet with the vice-president of human resources. This encounter really shook him up and has affected him thereafter, according to S.M. I appreciate that the Complainant was stressed by her negative performance review. Even so, such action was unprofessional on her part. I find this incident contributed to the breakdown of trust and confidence between S.M. and Ms. Fahmy.\n[104] As well, Ms. Fahmy had written emails to S.M. saying she wanted to be close to him and respect him. In an email of October 4, 2002 she wrote in part: Please smile, have a good weekend. I was not challenging you but I liked you soooo [sic] much, and carred [sic] about [you] so much as a manager. In a November 13th email she wrote, You did not allow me to talk to you. I wanted you to make me feel better. I refuse to believe that you don't want to. As with the above interaction, this is unacceptable behaviour in any workplace. Having worked in Canada for thirteen years, Ms. Fahmy should have known better. These actions led to the deterioration of her working relationship with S.M. and in my view, even though not specifically asserted by S.M., damaged her credibility with him.\n[105] Based on the viva voce and documentary evidence as outlined below, I find the GTAA has provided a reasonable non-discriminatory explanation for its actions:\n(ii) Inventory of Equipment [106] A.W. testified that when he began his work at GTAA in January 2003 he was shocked to learn that there wasn't an accurate, up-to-date inventory of all IT equipment. He indicated an inventory is critical to running any IT department and the organization in general. He assigned several people to compile the inventory, including a portion to Ms. Fahmy. He testified that the others completed their parts much faster than Ms. Fahmy. Indeed, he had to keep after her, to find out when her work would be completed. She sent an email saying the inventory was complete on March 18, 2003. He found out afterward that it was not and asked her to fix the oversight. She did. He said, not only was it incomplete, but it took her much longer. And it was not a technically difficult task. I also heard evidence that he had wanted them to do a physical inventory, not just remotely from their desk computer. She did not do that. Further, after she had left the employ of GTAA, it came to A.W.'s attention that there were other errors in the inventory done by Ms. Fahmy. He averred: It was so inaccurate...it couldn't be used and had to be redone.9 A.W. testified that he had to ask her a couple times a week about the progress on the inventory. When asked why she wasn't doing it, he replied, I was of the view she didn't want to do it. I accept the evidence above. I would add that it was clear from Ms. Fahmy's evidence that she did not want to do this task; she felt it was menial and beneath her expertise. I don't think the deficiencies in it and her lack of timeliness speak to her technical competence. Rather, I find she simply did not want to do the inventory. Again, it comes down to a miscomprehension of her role and responsibilities on her part.\n(iii) Missed Technical Deadlines [107] I heard evidence from several witnesses about the issue of the technical deadlines missed by Ms. Fahmy. Ms. Fahmy denies she missed any deadlines. I have carefully reviewed the viva voce evidence, and the document outlining each of the missed deadlines. In particular, I note that D.M. prepared a list for S.M., at the latter's request, which S.M. then used to send to Ms. Fahmy. D.M. testified that he thought there were several contributors to the missed deadlines list, and that the list prepared by S.M. and entered into evidence, was probably a summation of those items. D.M. claimed that he was told by S.M. to make it up, use your imagination if necessary. I don't accept this. Furthermore, D.M. testified that he did not fabricate anything; the list he set out was accurate and true. He stated: ...I have my own moral codes to live by, and that doesn't include making up information that is not wholly truthful. I believe him when he averred that he honestly made the list.\n[108] It was clear in his evidence that D.M., who was called to testify on behalf of Ms. Fahmy, had no warm feelings toward GTAA, and S.M. in particular. There was a mutual parting of the ways on February 15th. He was overly antagonistic to GTAA's counsel during cross-examination; he essentially threatened legal action against her. Indeed, after hours of cross-examination and with pages of questions remaining, Ms. Rusak took the decision to end her cross-examination and allow me to draw my own conclusions about the witness' credibility. Suffice to say that he was not a particularly credible witness. In addition, I believe he was trying to give the absolute best interpretation or spin in Ms. Fahmy's favour in his evidence.\n[109] D.M. was cross-examined in great detail about each of the twelve specific items on the missed deadlines list. Even with his inclination to be as supportive as possible to Ms. Fahmy, he indicated that four of the twelve missed deadlines were her responsibility; others partly her fault; some she was responsible for in terms of delegating them; and others that may not have been her fault or responsibility. Even if I accept his evidence that not all of them are totally her fault, there are still considerable missed deadlines by Ms. Fahmy, as outlined in D.M.'s and S.M.'s testimony. I note that S.M. testified that after the meeting with Ms. Fahmy, she sent him a number of emails correcting him on only three of the twelve missed deadlines; she had no issue with the remaining nine or ten. He added that he thought all twelve were her responsibility.10 It is not necessary that I determine the exact number of missed technical deadlines. Suffice to say that I find that she had missed a number of deadlines.\n(iv) RFC Change Management Protocol [110] S.M. instituted a new system for managing changes to servers, etc. in the IT department. This was for security reasons. If not done properly, it can bring down the entire system and increase your risk. He sent an email to his team outlining the new procedure, including having a Request for Change (RFC) form filled out and approved by him before changes were made. Upon reviewing the evidence on this issue, I find that Ms. Fahmy did not consistently follow the proper RFC protocol. I accept A.W.'s testimony that she had to be given one-on-one training on this: She required supervision until the day she left. She also received the group training by Jeff Gardiner that the others received in March 2003. A.W. said they didn't have this problem of compliance with the RFC protocol with any employee or contractor other than Ms. Fahmy. S.M. averred that she never seemed to master the RFC form and process. S.M. testified: She wouldn't follow the one page procedure; it's 101 stuff, not challenging. After introducing the policy, I'm still supporting a resource. And she was confusing people as to the policy. I accept their evidence. However, I infer that her problem was not that she couldn't master or understand the form or procedure. She did understand; she is an intelligent person. The problem was she didn't want to follow the procedure. That's why she was not consistently compliant. Again, it comes down to a question of her attitude and her inability to consistently follow direction. I also find that she was unwilling to accept that her role sometimes included doing the administrative and menial part of her job.\n(v) Heat Tickets [111] The Heat ticket system involved the escalation of technical problems by GTAA's employees to the help desk. Ms. Fahmy and the others were responsible to resolve the computer and other IT problems of employees in the Heat queue, at the third-level tier of escalation. S.M., A.W. and M.G. testified about problems with Ms. Fahmy's performance in this regard. M.G. stated that the Complainant took on fewer tickets (requests from users to fix a problem) than B.M. or himself. As well, he claimed that she was selective in the ones she did. Marie took easier ones that could be resolved quickly; ones that took longer she didn't touch. S.M. corroborated M.G.'s testimony. S.M. said he was concerned about the quantity and selective choosing of less technically difficult tickets by Ms. Fahmy. [B.M.] did three or four times as many as Ms. Fahmy did in a month. I sent an email to the department; needed everyone to `pull their weight'. It was a very busy time. I spoke to her and she frowned and said, `I'll do it. I'll be careful.' The Complainant denied that she took fewer and easier Heat tickets. I accept the GTAA's evidence on this issue.\n(vi) Showing Aelita Migration Tool to M.G. [112] On the issue of her competence and inconsistent work performance, GTAA presented evidence that she was instructed twice to train M.G. on the Aelita migration tool before she did so. And even then, M.G. testified that, She demonstrated it at a basic level only; not how to use it. And she was the only one who knew how to use it. Ms. Fahmy denies this. I find GTAA's evidence on this point accurate.\n(vii) Lynn Child's Complaint [113] Lynn Child is a systems administrator at GTAA. S.M. and A.W. asserted that she complained about Ms. Fahmy's work building servers for her. Ms. Child and Vishwa Surajram were two examples given by GTAA to show that clients didn't want to use her services because of work performance issues.\n[114] Ms. Child testified that she was supposed to have a new server configured and installed on the new Windows 2000 domain. She said Ms. Fahmy eventually did it. However, she had difficulty getting information from her about the status of the work and it took inordinately long to complete. I had to go downstairs every day to find out what was going on with our servers...Should be Marie's task, not mine...Once Roger got involved, things moved and the problem got fixed. She said she hasn't had a similar problem since then with any other IT person at GTAA. She asked S.M. not to have Ms. Fahmy work on any of their projects ever again. Ms. Child conceded that Ms. Fahmy did in fact work for her again: Maybe small things, like rebooting.\n[115] In cross-examination, Ms. MacKinnon suggested to the witness that there may have been a communication problem. The delay may have been due to Ms. Fahmy thinking one of her colleagues had ordered a SAN cable that was required. Even if that were so, Ms. Fahmy was responsible as the contact person for Ms. Child. It was incumbent upon Ms. Fahmy to have kept on top of it and advise Ms. Child of the status.\n(viii) Vishwa Surajram's Complaint [116] I heard evidence that Mr. Surajram was a senior person at GTAA, a data base administrator who worked at GTAA for seven years. He was a major client of GTAA's IT Systems Operations. A.W. said that his area accounted for half the system work. Mr. Surajram testified that he had asked Ms. Fahmy in February or March 2003 to build a server. She did. Soon thereafter, he had problems with it. He asked that she rebuild it and she did. The same problem persisted. He then asked A.W. to assign someone else in the department to build it for a third and, hopefully, final time. Mr. Surajram didn't want Ms. Fahmy to attempt a third build. B.M. rebuilt it successfully.\n[117] Mr. Surajram was also asked about Ms. Fahmy's technical competence. He said that Ms. Fahmy took one or two weeks to do the two builds; it should have only taken one-half to one day. That's how long it took B.M., testified Mr. Surajram. The witness was candid. He said, It's hard to judge based on one example of her technical skills. But for the server build, she didn't have the technical skills. It's a standard request; not difficult. I would ask her technical questions and she said wait until the next day for the answer. That was unusual.\n[118] Ms. Fahmy denies that she ever built the server for Mr. Surajram. In cross-examination, Mr. Surajram conceded that he had no documentation to show the server was built. But he added, The server exists. While I find it odd that no documentation was entered to show the actual work was done, I am satisfied from the viva voce evidence of Mr. Surajram and A.W., along with the documentation referring to Mr. Surajram's complaint, that his evidence is reliable. I find Ms. Fahmy failed to properly build the server twice for Mr. Surajram, and that it took much longer than usual for that type of work to be completed.\n(ix) Conclusion About Work Performance and Employment Termination [119] Based on the foregoing, I conclude that Ms. Fahmy's work performance was not consistently satisfactory. There were numerous examples of work that were lacking in quality, hence weak technical skills, as indicated above. According to S.M., one example of her weak technical skills was with her faulty migration of his laptop. Another example involved her incorrectly shutting down the system. S.M. remarked, If [V.J.] did it, maybe one time. With Ms. Fahmy, it was seven to nine times when the server just rebooted on its own. I checked the log. Twice I know it was happening when she came out of the computer room and at that time, we didn't have remote control. It hasn't happened since she left the GTAA. She denies these allegations. She did not perform anywhere near the perfect level that she ascribed to her work. In a letter to the Commission undated but marked received on December 11, 2003, she wrote, Investigation is my only way to prove what I wrote in my complaint and how I performed my duties perfectly. See also her January 6, 2004 reply to the Commission at p. 20: My performance was constantly perfect. There was nothing wrong with my performance. This is not to say that she should have performed perfect work, and I am not suggesting that she failed to do any good work. She clearly did, and GTAA concedes as such. Included in work performance are her sometimes inappropriate interactions with her manager, S.M. and display of poor attitude. I find this is encapsulated in the clause little or no understanding of your position's role and responsibilities found in the May 1st termination letter.\nN. Allegation #11: Performance Appraisal and the Process was a Sham or Pretext [120] Ms. Fahmy alleges that the performance appraisal given to her on November 8, 2002, did not accurately reflect her work and was in fact part of a sham process designed to justify her discriminatory treatment and termination from employment.\n[121] Ms. MacKinnon argues that Ms. Fahmy was used as a scapegoat, set up to fail and the performance review system was a means to the end of terminating her employment. She also submits that there was evidence to show a hostile or poisoned workplace, although falling short of a systemic problem. Ms. Rusak objects, citing a lack of notice and an earlier ruling by me disallowing the Complainant from pursuing this avenue by asking about the conduct of managers in other departments towards female employees at GTAA. Consistent with my comment earlier in my Reasons about the issue of harassment, I will not make a finding about harassment or poisoned workplace at GTAA. The question of whether Ms. Fahmy was used as a scapegoat is one that I will determine.\n[122] I have reviewed carefully the viva voce and documentary evidence about the performance appraisals (November 8 and December 17, 2002) and numerous meetings addressing her work performance. I also note and accept S.M.'s evidence that while he may not have had many meetings with Ms. Fahmy since March 2003 when he was mostly working onsite at the Terminal 1 building, the ones he did have were significant. Under the collective agreement, GTAA is only required to have one performance review for a probationary employee, at mid-point in the period. It did that: the November 8, 2002 appraisal and the meetings to discuss it. S.M., Ms. Maack, the union representative, and human resources consultant Jennifer Erbiceanu, met with the Complainant on November 13 and 15, 2002 to discuss the appraisal. Detailed notes taken of these meetings were entered as exhibits. On December 17, 2002 Ms. Fahmy was given a second written performance appraisal, noting improvement in all areas to a satisfactory level, for the over one month period since the last one. Her probationary period was extended for another six months. Ms. Fahmy claims that she received no feedback on her performance after December 17th until her termination from work on May 1, 2003. I note that S.M. testified that he completed another performance appraisal of Ms. Fahmy in the second or third week of April. It was never given as Ms. Fahmy's employment was terminated on May 1st and it was not entered into evidence.\n[123] I find that the content of the performance appraisals given and the process were reasonable and satisfactory. The purpose of the process is to give feedback to the employee and to allow for improvement and for the employer to be able to assess the employee during this probationary period. I am satisfied that the November 8th appraisal, along with the November 13, 15, 22 and 29 meetings and the December 17 appraisal provided her with a reasonable assessment of her work from the perspective of GTAA. The appraisal process included the employer providing her with a list of missed deadlines. I also accept S.M.'s and A.W.'s evidence that she was provided with notice of concerns of her performance, in less formal situations than the written performance appraisals, including in 2003.\n[124] The process was not a pretext or a sham. The performance appraisal process was not a vehicle to facilitate a discriminatory dismissal. I also find that part of the problem was that Ms. Fahmy simply did not agree with the evaluation of her work by S.M. It is highlighted in the notes of the November 13, 2002 meeting among S.M., union representative Mark Daniels, Maria Maack, Jennifer Erbiceanu and Ms. Fahmy. This meeting was called as a result of the office incident that day involving the closing and opening of the door, and where S.M. was so concerned that he called his wife. GTAA made it quite clear in this meeting that if her work didn't improve by the end of her probationary period in December, her employment would be terminated. The notes indicate Ms. Fahmy indicated the problems with S.M. all started when she didn't want to be on just one project - [she] wanted more. Ms. Fahmy acknowledged that in her testimony. The one project she didn't want to exclusively work on happened to be the most expensive and significant one the IT department was working on at the time.\n[125] Even when she wrote and said to S.M. that she agreed with his criticisms, she was not genuine. It is clear from her testimony and her documents to the Commission that she didn't believe it when she wrote it and said it. She was trying to win him. Part of it may be understandable in that she was terrified of losing her job, but the sheer disingenuousness of it all makes one less sympathetic. To this day, she does not accept the critique of the GTAA.\n[126] I do find that GTAA did not bring the Lynn Child and Vishwa Surajram complaints about Ms. Fahmy's work to her attention. GTAA should have done so. However, its failure to do so does not amount to a violation of section 7 of the CHRA. There is no connection with a prohibited ground of discrimination. However, there were enough issues brought to her attention through the formal and informal processes that it should have been clear to Ms. Fahmy that there was a problem with her work from her employer's perspective.\n[127] Ms. Fahmy also asserted that the extension of her probationary period was a ruse or pretext to terminating her employment. I do not accept this. If GTAA had wanted to get rid of her as an employee, it could have done so at the end of her term in December 2002. GTAA had ample evidence. GTAA didn't have to extend her probation for six months. Ms. Fahmy says her former employer did so because it wanted to make sure it didn't get involved in litigation. If that was GTAA's motive, it didn't work out very well - five years later having dealt with the Commission, the grievance arbitration process and the hearing before the Tribunal. I accept S.M.'s testimony that he told her to relax, be yourself and wanted to give her more time to improve. I find that GTAA extended her probationary period in good faith, with the expectation and intention of allowing her the opportunity to improve, instead of with a view of better documenting its case for dismissal.\n[128] I appreciate that Ms. Fahmy does not believe GTAA was genuine in its decision to extend her probation. She testified, Around December, I knew there was a plot. However, based on the evidence, I see no plot, no sham, and no pretext to find a way to terminate her employment. As I indicated earlier, I do not accept D.M.'s testimony that he was asked by S.M. to make up deficiencies in Ms. Fahmy's work. D.M. himself said he did not do that. His missed deadlines list was accurate and prepared in good faith. And I find that the emails from A.W., M.G. and B.M. to S.M. complaining about Ms. Fahmy's work on April 29 and May 1, 2003 were not concocted or made in bad faith. I believe this cluster of emails was the last straw that prompted S.M. to recommend her employment be terminated on May 1st. I do find that S.M. and A.W. had properly advised employees who were complaining about Ms. Fahmy to put it in writing. That's a far cry from soliciting or making up false criticisms of her work performance.\nVII. CONCLUSION [129] In one of her letters outlining the particulars of her complaint to the Commission which was produced on March 12, 2004, Ms. Fahmy wrote at para. 6: My only sin was that I was not white and not a man. She also wrote at p. 14 of her response of January 6, 2004: ...I was treated as a slave because of what he [S.M.] did to me. It is unfortunate that she feels this way. However, the most persuasive evidence establishes otherwise. Any differential treatment that may be characterized as adverse, and her termination from employment, were based on non-CHRA-related reasons, as outlined in my Reasons for Decision. They had nothing to do with her being a woman, a person of colour, or of Egyptian origin. Accordingly, the Complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nMatthew D.

INTRODUCTION [1] On June 20, 2005, Jamel Ben Salem (the complainant) filed a complaint in accordance with the Canadian Human Rights Act, S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the Act) against the Canadian National Railway Company (CN). The complainant alleges that CN discriminated against him on the basis of race and national or ethnic origin in refusing to employ him, contrary to section 7 of the Act.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not attend the hearing.\n[3] From the outset, I must point out that the objective of this decision is not to determine whether the complainant would have made a good train conductor, or to redo CN's selection process. Rather, my role is to decide, relying on the evidence presented at the hearing, whether it has been established that CN discriminated against the complainant during the hiring process.\n[4] It is also not my role, given that this program is not under federal jurisdiction, to determine whether those responsible for the training offered at C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin misled the complainant by giving him a reasonable expectation that after his training he would be automatically hired as a train conductor. I would however venture to make certain remarks about this program, including its selection process, as well as the role that some supervisors played in the complainant's disappointments.\nA. THE FACTS (i) The complainant [5] The complainant, a native of Tunisia, arrived in Canada with his family at the end of October 2002. On November 27, 2006, he received his Canadian citizenship. He says that from the time he arrived in Canada until March 8, 2005, he could not find anything other than part-time employment.\n[6] He therefore decided that he would pursue a Master of Mechanical Engineering degree at the \u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure in Montr\u00e9al until he found permanent employment. However, his family obligations prevented him from seeing this through. He then registered in a training program to obtain a teaching permit for vocational training. In July 2003, the Minist\u00e8re de l'\u00c9ducation du Qu\u00e9bec gave him his permit.\n[7] According to his curriculum vitae, the complainant has sixteen (16) years of experience in railway maintenance, mechanical manufacturing, quality systems and vocational training. He has a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering degree that he received in Tunisia and an Attestation of Collegial Studies - Train Crews from C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin, obtained in 2004. Later on, we will take a more in-depth look at the training program offered by the C\u00c9GEP.\n[8] From 1986 to 1988, he worked for the national department of education of Tunisia as a vocational training instructor in mechanical engineering. From 1988 to 1989, he was an office manager for a company in Tunis. On June 1, 1989, he began work for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger in Tunis, as a junior engineer. In June 1990, he was certified for this position. His curriculum vitae states that he also worked at this company as an office planning manager and as an electromechanical maintenance foreman. He also filed in evidence a certificate from Belgium's International Institute for Transportation Education certifying that in 1995 he studied the [translation] international training cycle in railways and railway transport. There was no description of the substance of this training offered at the hearing.\n[9] To demonstrate his knowledge of English, the complainant filed in evidence a diploma from the Tunis British Council, indicating that his proficiency level in English was intermediate. According to this document, the candidate must complete 440 hours of instruction to achieve this level. The intermediate proficiency level means, according to the document, that the student is able to initiate and conduct conversation on a wide range of personal and factual subjects; understand the main points of authentic texts on factual topics; follow the gist of lectures and extensive rapid speech; write accurate summaries of discussions or texts and simple discursive compositions on abstract topics. They have an active vocabulary of about 3000 words.\n(ii) The labour needs of Quebec's railway industry and the training program offered by C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin [10] Concerned by the manpower succession problems in Quebec's railway industry, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de promotion de l'industrie ferroviaire, of which Pierre Fallu, one of CN's witnesses, is the CEO, created a sectoral table of the railway industry in cooperation with Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec. One of the mandates of this sectoral table was to establish a partnership between the representatives of different railway companies in the province of Quebec and training institutions in order to respond to the manpower training needs of the railway industry.\n[11] In March 2003, this sectoral table filed a report entitled [translation] The Railway Industry in Quebec, Manpower and Vocational Training. This report analyzed the problem of the aging labour force in the railway industry, assessed recruiting needs while targeting critical functions, and proposed a new training approach. The assessments made by the authors of the report led to the finding that the annual volume of train crew recruitment in the five years following its publication would be significant enough to warrant the development of a [translation] pre-employment training program for the functions of train conductor and locomotive engineer.\n[12] Generally, a train crew is made up of a conductor and a locomotive engineer. The duties of the train conductor and the locomotive engineer more or less vary according to the type of railway and its scale. Train conductors work as members of the train crew on road service (freight trains or passenger trains) or shunting. They ensure a proper formation of the trains and their safe arrival at the destination. They are also responsible for keeping the register. The main role of the locomotive engineer is to drive locomotives in order to ensure that rolling stock is picked up and delivered, and to ensure the transport of merchandise and passengers. To become a locomotive engineer, an individual must first be a train conductor.\n[13] According to the sectoral table, the Quebec railway industry planned to hire between 20 and 25 new locomotive engineers and between 30 and 35 new train conductors every year for the five years following the filing of the report. In order to respond to the industry's manpower training needs, the sectoral table, in cooperation with C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin, developed and implemented a train crew training program for 2003 and 2004.\n[14] Beginning with an analysis prepared by the Railway Association of Canada, those supervising the new training program called [translation] Railway transport: train crews were able to prepare a competency profile for the train conductor and locomotive engineer professions. The training program was developed in cooperation with railway industry representatives and training experts.\n[15] The program offered by C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin led to an Attestation of Collegial Studies. Its primary objective was to prepare manpower specifically trained to respond to the needs of the railway industry. It contemplated, according to its supervisors, training [translation] future employees to work as train crew members for road service or shunting. It added that at the end of their training, the candidates [translation] could be hired by railway companies in Quebec and Canada and be certified as train conductors or locomotive engineers.\n(iii) The complainant registered for the training program [16] On March 31, 2004, the complainant attended an information session at a Montr\u00e9al hotel. At this meeting, C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin, in cooperation with Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec and the sectoral table, announced that a new training program would be established. This program was designed for an adult clientele seeking careers, in the words of the document given to the attendees, [translation] providing sound job opportunities, with attractive salaries and benefits as well as job security. It was also indicated that there would be [translation] on-the-job training on the list of courses offered under the program.\n[17] At this meeting, the supervisors explained the admissions procedure for the program. First, the candidate had to fill out the forms required by Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec. According to Pierre Fallu, 30 or so individuals filled out the registration form and about 25 candidates were called to an admission interview.\n[18] Following this information session, the complainant went to Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec to fill out the requisite form. He was then called to an interview by the C\u00c9GEP's selection committee, presided over by Pierre Fallu, who was also the sectoral table coordinator and, as we stated earlier, the CEO of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de promotion de l'industrie ferroviaire. The committee also included Jacques Lacoste, the C\u00c9GEP's representative, and Yannick Brunet, a railway industry representative. Neither Mr. Lacoste nor Mr. Brunet was called as a witness.\n[19] According to the interview synthesis report filed in evidence, Jacques Lacoste gave the complainant a mark of 7\/10 for his interview. The other two evaluators, Mr. Fallu and Mr. Brunet, for their part, wrote the comment over on their assessment sheets. According to Pierre Fallu, he and Mr. Brunet were of the opinion that the complainant was overqualified for the position of train conductor and, if given such a position, would promptly resign from his train conductor functions once a better employment opportunity became available. It is interesting to note that none of the evaluators referred to any communication problems as a basis for refusing to admit the complainant to the program and none of them expressed any real doubt about whether he had the ability to work as a train conductor, other than that he was overqualified. It was indeed because of this [translation] overqualification that the committee initially recommended the complainant not be admitted to the program.\n[20] Since Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec required a group of 15 to 20 students and the interview results fell short of this number, the selection committee decided to review its recommendations for certain candidates. According to Mr. Fallu's testimony, even though the complainant [translation] did not demonstrate that he had the skills to work as a train conductor, the committee, in order to meet Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec's objectives, decided despite everything to accept him in the program. According to Mr. Fallu, the complainant was admitted to the program only in order to have the number of registrations required by Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec.\n[21] On cross-examination, Mr. Fallu added that [translation] I can tell you, Mr. Ben Salem, that my first impression when I saw you at the interview was that you are accident-prone. You do not have the skills to deal with emergency situations. This comment is surprising because it is not mentioned in the interview report. Further, if it is true that Mr. Fallu had this opinion of the complainant, it is astounding that he agreed to admit him to the program.\n[22] Finally, 19 candidates, including the complainant, were accepted for the program. Training began on May 17, 2004. Even though the program was offered by C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin, the courses were given on CN's premises at Central Station, in Montr\u00e9al. Indeed, some of the instructors were CN employees.\n[23] The training program was made up of various modules. During the first session, students had to complete modules on [translation] railway infrastructure, [translation] the professions of train conductor and locomotive engineer, [translation] railway safety, [translation] the railway as a business, [translation] railway communications and [translation] job shadowing and on-the-job training. During the second session, the modules included [translation] introduction to computers, [translation] customer service and business relations, [translation] rail operating rules, [translation] authorization and record-keeping, [translation] inspections, manoeuvring and shunting tests, [translation] locomotive operation, [translation] operation of the locomotive and the train and, finally, a [translation] workplace internship. According to the program description, the internship was supposed to be 255 hours over an eight-week period.\n[24] On May 17, 2005, the complainant received his Attestation of Collegial Studies. His Bulletin d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales [Collegial Studies Transcript] indicates that his marks were higher than average in practically all of the courses. For example, in the [translation] railway safety module, his mark was 96, when the group average was 91; in [translation] the professions of train conductor and locomotive engineer, his mark was 94, when the group average was 82; in [translation] railway communications, his mark was 93 and the average was 90; and, finally, in the [translation] workplace internship, he was given a mark of 91, while the group average was 89.\n[25] The mark assigned for [translation] workplace internship is interesting to say the least. According to Mr. Fallu, the railway industry had indicated to those supervising the program that, with a few exceptions, it was not accepting interns. He added that the workplace internship requirement arose from financing requirements issued by Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec. To my surprise, Mr. Fallu testified that the complainant had never completed a workplace internship. When I asked him why the complainant had been given a mark of 91 for an internship, he responded that [translation] all of the students received the same mark for that course. When I pointed out to him that the group average on the complainant's transcript was 89 and that therefore not all of the students could have received the same mark, he offered the following explanation: [translation] the C\u00c9GEP had a problem on its hands. It was receiving government funds for an internship, but this internship never took place. To assign a mark, the student's progress in obtaining employment was observed. But there was no workplace internship. When I asked him how a mark could be assigned for an internship that never took place, he added the following: [translation] I have trouble understanding that, too; it was a delicate situation for the C\u00c9GEP. The C\u00c9GEP had no choice but to assign a mark for this module and they were graded on the steps the students took to find work. You should ask the C\u00c9GEP; I was not involved.\n[26] On cross-examination, he added the following: [translation] Some companies agreed to do internships. The C\u00c9GEP undertook to have internships. After I provided the information to the C\u00c9GEP to the effect that the companies were not offering actual internships, but complementary training, the C\u00c9GEP . . . decided to communicate with industries offering this additional training to see how workplace internships were conducted. I do not know how they worked this out with Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec because it is a significant number of program hours. Later on he stated the following: [translation] There were marks for the internship, but in 95% of the cases, there was no internship. The witness' explanations on this point were far from satisfactory.\n[27] Jacques Lacoste, the educational consultant from C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin wrote a quite flattering letter of recommendation for the complainant. Unfortunately, Mr. Lacoste was not called as a witness at the hearing. Regarding this letter, Mr. Fallu made another remarkable comment. According to him, those supervising the program had decided to standardize the students' letters of recommendation, to the extent that the letters were, according to Mr. Fallu, [translation] cut and paste letters. Such a process, if this is really what happened, is not very conscientious and betrays both a lack of respect and professionalism in respect of both potential employers and students registered in the program.\n[28] Mr. Fallu did not seem like a credible witness to me and, apart from a tendency to be defensive and blame others for the problems encountered, his testimony did not in any way clarify the issue that I have to decide. I must admit, however, having listened to this testimony, that I am in a better position to understand the complainant's frustration with Mr. Fallu and with the training program.\n(iv) The advertisement for the CN position and the candidate selection process [29] Christine O'Neill, CN's Director of Human Resources for Eastern Canada, testified at length regarding the respondent's hiring process. I found her to be a credible and trustworthy witness. Her answers to the questions were considered and measured.\n[30] She explained that, in March 2005, CN was looking for employees to carry out train conductor functions. She was at that time aware of the training program offered at C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin because Ms. S. Seebeck, Director of Training at CN, who worked in close cooperation with the sectoral table, had informed her of it. However, she added that CN did not play a role in the recruitment or admission of students for this program and that CN had not made any undertaking to the students who were registered in it. However, Ms. O'Neill added that she was prepared to receive these students for interviews, because she was [translation] urgently seeking candidates for train conductor positions and she knew that these students, even though they had no practical experience, had the technical knowledge necessary to perform this work. Ms. Seebeck therefore referred her to Mr. Lacoste and she also sent her the curricula vitae of the students she had received from the C\u00c9GEP.\n[31] In 2005, therefore, CN announced on its internet site that it was in the process of building a [translation] pool of candidates interested in a career as a train conductor. The advertisement describes the requirements of the position as follows:\nGood teamwork skills;\nGood people skills;\nPhysically fit to do the work;\nKnowledge of the signals and the signal register for the purposes of obtaining the proper information;\nGood reading skills;\nInformation technology skills and computer skills suitable for the work;\nAbility to properly analyze a situation and to react appropriately;\nShifts far from home for periods of up to 6 days;\nBe on call, ready and able to work on assignment.\n[32] Ms. O'Neill added to the list of skills the knowledge of English, deemed essential to work as a train conductor with CN. Although this was not mentioned in the advertisement, when candidates filled out their application forms, they were asked a question regarding their knowledge of English and French.\n[33] The candidates who wanted to apply for train conductor positions had to apply through CN's website and fill out a form entitled Candidate Response Report which was a sort of a self-assessment done by the candidates. According to Ms. O'Neill, 71 people applied. Of these, 11 were from C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin. Without explaining where she got this information, she added that the eight other students from the C\u00c9GEP did not apply either because they had found employment elsewhere or because their knowledge of English was inadequate.\n[34] On January 25, 2005, the complainant applied through the website. To the question, Some of our positions require bilingualism. Can you read and speak fluently in both English [and] French?, the complainant responded yes. According to Ms. O'Neill some answers given on the Candidate Response Report could prompt the candidate's immediate disqualification. She gave as an example the response to the question regarding the candidate's bilingualism. If the candidate answered no to this question, the candidate was automatically excluded from the list, barring evidence to the contrary. The complainant was not disqualified at this stage.\n[35] The first stage of CN's hiring process consisted of a [translation] train movement test. This test is described as a [translation] a test of logic where candidates are asked to move railway cars on paper as they would have to do if they were hired for the job. The candidates had 25 minutes to complete this test. Ms. O'Neill corrected this test.\n[36] The complainant, having passed the train movement test, was called to an interview with Christine O'Neill on March 8, 2005. For some candidates, Ms. O'Neill stated that the interview would be held before two interviewers, the other interviewer being there to assess the candidate's technical knowledge. In the case of the students from C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin, only Ms. O'Neill was present at the interview, because she presumed that they already had the necessary technical knowledge and that she did not need another interviewer to help her with these questions.\n[37] The candidates' interviews began on February 23, 2005, and continued until March 13, 2005. According to Ms. O'Neill, she always begins interview with general questions, so as to put the candidate at ease. She added that, as a general rule, she takes a lot of notes during interviews, while stating that [translation] if someone is speaking quickly, I have fewer notes, but if they are speaking more slowly, I can take notes that are more complete. In the case of the complainant, since he spoke slowly, she had the time to take more notes.\n[38] For the interviews, Ms. O'Neill referred to a document entitled Interview Guide for Entry-Level Transportation. According to this guide, the first area to be addressed is the candidate's work background. According to Ms. O'Neill's notes - taken in English even though the interview was held in French - the complainant explained to her at that time that he had a diploma in mechanical engineering and more than 13 years of experience in the railway industry. He also told her about the training program that he had completed at C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin. Regarding the issue of why he wanted to work for the respondent, the complainant told her that he had always wanted to work for a Class 1 railway.\n[39] The witness stated that she [translation] assumed that the complainant had a good technical knowledge of a train conductor's work based on the courses that he had taken at C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin and his previous experience. It was therefore not necessary to verify this aspect any further. She stated that during the interview the complainant was generally reserved and shy and that it was sometimes difficult to get answers out of him.\n[40] Ms. O'Neill explained that she then proceeded with a series of questions in order to gauge the complainant's reaction in specific work scenarios.\n[41] For a series of questions intended to measure what she describes as the [translation] orientation dimension, she gave the complainant a mark of three out of five on his answers in terms of substance and two out of five for his communication skills. According to her scale, three out of five is equivalent to [translation] good. With a mark of two, the candidate did not meet her requirements. Ms. O'Neill recognized that the complainant's interview guide is apparently the only copy on which she put numerical marks. She stated the following: [translation] I do not know why. I do not know if it was because I had time to do it, but that is the only place where I put marks. Often I put plus and minus signs, but I do not know why I did not do that in this case.\n[42] Then there were questions intended to gauge the candidate's autonomy. For this part of the interview, the complainant received a mark of two out of five, which indicated that he did not meet the expected requirements. Ms. O'Neill explained that, according to her assessment, the complainant's answers to questions that he was asked did not substantiate her finding that he was autonomous. She stated the following: [translation] He was passive, but reliable. With his attitude, CN loses money.\n[43] In terms of the [translation] reliability aspect, the complainant satisfied Ms. O'Neill's expectations. She even added that his answers in this part of the interview were [translation] very good, hence the mark of three that she gave him for reliability as well as communication.\n[44] In the section bearing on [translation] practical training, Ms. O'Neill explained that all train conductors must complete training and that her objective was therefore to assess whether the candidate would see this training through to the end, even if this training proved to be difficult. Once again in this part of the interview, Ms. O'Neill was satisfied with the substance of the complainant's answers, but she was quite critical in regard to his communication abilities. She said the following: [translation] When candidates come to an interview, skills are all very well, but they must be able to sell themselves. He [the complainant] had trouble communicating one on one with me. He was very passive at the interview. I had to push him to answer the questions.\n[45] In regard to the part bearing on the complainant's cooperation skills, Ms. O'Neill said that she was not satisfied with the answers given. She found that he had not managed to show that he had good cooperation skills. She stated that, on a train, the train conductors have no disciplinary power over their work colleagues - they must rather have negotiating skills. They must be in constant negotiation in order to [translation] make the train run smoothly. She considered that the complainant's answers did not show the necessary cooperative spirit.\n[46] Finally, she indicated that she always asks her final question in the other official language - in this case, English. While recognizing that the complainant had replied in English, she added that she had not [translation] understood his English very well and that his skills in this language were not sufficient to meet the requirements of the position.\n[47] In general terms, Ms. O'Neill explained that, following the interview, she did not have any concerns regarding the complainant's ability to [translation] learn the rules. What did concern her, however, was [translation] his ability to use his people skills and his communication abilities. At the end of the interview, according to Ms. O'Neill's assessment, the complainant did not qualify for the train conductor position. She stated that he did not meet the requirements in terms of good teamwork skills or his ability to properly assess a situation and react accordingly. Ms. O'Neill stated on cross-examination that she had not hired candidates who were less qualified than the complainant because she found that he was not qualified.\n[48] She added that she used the same interview guide for each candidate and that this guide was in her opinion the best available to her. She said that she relied on the answers she was given during the interview and on no other factors to make her decision.\n[49] On cross-examination, the complainant questioned Ms. O'Neill at length regarding the answers that the candidates who were hired gave during their interviews. Without undertaking an in-depth review of the witness' explanations, because my objective is not to rehash the interview process, I must point out that her answers seem credible and reasonable to me and are not at all consistent with a finding that the respondent discriminated against the complainant.\n[50] With regard to the allegations that she discriminated against the complainant because he is Arab, Ms. O'Neill, while acknowledging that she had interviewed only one Arab in 2005, namely, the complainant, added that she had tested more than one. For example, she explained that another Arab candidate had been tested, but that he had withdrawn his application because he had found another position with another company. In 2007, this candidate was again available and since he had already passed the written test, he was called to another interview and was ultimately hired. Today, he works as a train conductor with the respondent.\n[51] Ms. O'Neill also referred to another Arab candidate with the same training as the complainant, who in April 2007 applied to work as a trackman with the respondent and who had been hired. She added that he is now an assistant track supervisor. She pointed out that he has not been hired as a train conductor as he is not yet bilingual.\n[52] The complainant alleges, without supporting evidence, that the respondent had hired these individuals in response to his complaint, in order to counter it. I cannot agree with these arguments which are no more than suppositions. I note however that the complainant, after his first failure, never again applied to CN for work as a train conductor or for any other work; it is therefore impossible to know whether CN would have hired him.\n[53] As a result of its hiring process, the respondent recruited 25 new train conductors. Of the 11 candidates from C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin who applied, only six reported for the interview. The remaining five allegedly withdrew their applications because in the interim they had found employment elsewhere. Of the six who were interviewed, five were offered employment. Of those five, Ms. O'Neill stated that there was [translation] one immigrant and one woman.\n[54] The complainant says that he contacted the C\u00c9GEP a few days after his interview to see whether he had been hired to work as a train conductor at CN. Jacques Lacoste allegedly told him that his application had been rejected. The complainant says that he made several attempts to reach Ms. O'Neill to find out why his application had been rejected, but was unsuccessful.\n[55] On June 20, 2005, the complainant filed a complaint against CN. According to the complainant, CN's discrimination was deliberate because the decision not to hire him based on his ethnic origin was, in his opinion, made before he was called to the interview.\nB. Legal context [56] Section 7 of the Act provides that refusing to employ an individual for reasons based on a prohibited ground of discrimination, including inter alia national or ethnic origin, is a discriminatory practice (see also sections 3 and 15 of the Act).\n[57] The burden of proof, in a matter like this one, is first on the complainant, who must establish a prima facie case of discrimination (see Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, 1618; Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029; Premakumar v. Air Canada, T.D. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04; and Lincoln v. Bay Ferries, 2004 FCA 204).\n[58] A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent (Ontario (Ontario Human Rights Commission) v. Etobicoke (Borough), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at page 208; Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at paragraph 28).\n[59] In a hiring context, a prima facie case is described as requiring evidence of the following elements:\nThe complainant was qualified for the employment at issue; The complainant was not hired; Someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature, which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint, subsequently obtained the position.\n(Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd. (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, at paragraph 8918)\n[60] Once prima facie evidence has been established, the burden shifts to the respondent, who must then provide a reasonable explanation for the conduct alleged against the respondent (see Lincoln, supra, at paragraph 23).\n[61] The case law recognizes that it is difficult to establish discrimination through direct evidence. As stated in Basi, discrimination is often subtle. Overt discrimination is rare (see Basi, supra, paragraph D\/5038). The Tribunal therefore must consider all of the circumstances to establish whether there is what was described as a subtle scent of discrimination (Premakumar, paragraph 79).\n[62] The standard of evidence in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. According to this standard, discrimination may be inferred where the evidence offered in support of the discrimination renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (Premakumar, paragraph 81). However, discriminatory considerations need not be the sole reason for the practices at issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient if these considerations are factors in the decision not to hire (Premakumar, paragraph 82, Holden v. Canadian National Railway (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at paragraph D\/15).\n[63] I must also point out that it is not the Tribunal's duty to determine the merits of the respondent's choice of candidates. There is a subjective element in every hiring process. The mere fact that the respondent used subjective criteria to assess the candidates and that it may have erred in doing so does not in itself expose its decision to challenge on grounds of discrimination, even though the existence of subjective criteria may require greater scrutiny of the hiring decision (see Folch v. Canadian Airlines International Ltd. (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/261, D\/303; Morin v. Canada (RCMP), 2005 CHRT 41, at paragraph 213).\nC. Application of these requirements to this case [64] In Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd, [2004] F.C.A. 204, the Federal Court of Appeal states at paragraph 22 that to answer the question as to whether prima facie evidence has been established, the Tribunal must not, at this stage, consider the respondent's answer. Therefore, to answer the question as to whether the complainant had the skills for the employment at issue, I will refer essentially to the evidence filed by the complainant. The evidence shows that the complainant had an Attestation of Collegial Studies from C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin, confirming that he did pass the training program [translation] Railway transport: train crews. According to Ms. O'Neill, this program should have given him the technical knowledge necessary to work as a train conductor. Further, he had a diploma in mechanical engineering and some railway work experience in Tunisia, even though I acknowledge that this experience was not as a train conductor. The complainant also received a passing mark in the [translation] train movement test. For the purposes of establishing prima facie evidence, we can therefore find that the complainant established that he had the necessary technical qualifications for the train conductor position.\n[65] The evidence also established that the complainant was not hired for the desired position. Therefore, the first two tests in Shakes, necessary to establish prima facie evidence, have been satisfied. What of the third test, however? I cannot find based on the evidence whether the respondent hired someone who was less qualified than the complainant. However, I am prepared to find that prima facie evidence was nevertheless established for the purposes of this case.\n[66] On this point, I must point out that in Premakumar v. Air Canada, T.D. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04, the Tribunal emphasized that the Shakes tests, while useful guides, should not be rigidly or arbitrarily applied. Rather, the circumstances of each individual matter must be considered to establish whether, in the end, the complainant satisfies the O'Malley test, i.e., was the evidence before the Tribunal complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent? Therefore, applying this flexible approach to this case, I find that for the purposes of the first part of the decision that the complainant established a prima facie case of discrimination in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\n[67] With prima facie evidence established, the burden now shifts to the respondent, which must provide a reasonable explanation for the conduct alleged against it.\n[68] Ms. O'Neill clearly set out how the candidates for the train conductor position were assessed and the reasons why she considered that the complainant's profile was not adequate for this position. She pointed out, inter alia, the fact that, in her opinion, the complainant had communication problems, that she was not satisfied with his teamwork skills, that she considered that his reactions in certain circumstances did not meet the respondent's expectations and that his English-language skills were inadequate.\n[69] In regard to the train conductor job candidates' English-language skills, even though this requirement was not mentioned in the job advertisement, the uncontested evidence filed at the hearing clearly shows that the candidates knew that this would be a consideration in the decision whether or not to hire them. The Candidate Response Report asked the following question: Some of our position[s] require bilingualism. Can you read and speak fluently in both English [and] French? Indeed, and despite the fact that I assign little credibility to the evidence submitted by Pierre Fallu, he did testify to the effect that the students from C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin had all been told not to apply to a Class 1 railway if their English was not adequate.\n[70] The complainant did not dispute this evidence. Rather, he sought to establish that he had this skill by filing in evidence a certificate from the British Council of Tunis, stating that he had some English skills. Ms. O'Neill did not seem to be persuaded of this during the interview and considered that the complainant's English-language skills were inadequate. No evidence was filed that would support my determining that Ms. O'Neill arrived at this conclusion based on the complainant's national or ethnic origin.\n[71] Considering all of the evidence, I am persuaded that the respondent met its burden and that it successfully established that its decision not to hire the complainant for a train conductor position was not at all based on discriminatory grounds. Ms. O'Neill explained the reasons why she had not hired the complainant and those explanations do not at all suggest that the complainant's race or national or ethnic origin was a consideration. Further, her explanations are reasonable and do not seem like pretext.\n[72] Although I sympathize a great deal with the complainant's situation and I can understand his frustration and disillusionment, inter alia in regard to the program offered by the C\u00c9GEP G\u00e9rald-Godin, I cannot find that his situation was the result of a discriminatory practice by the respondent. I point out again that the Tribunal is not mandated to decide on the effectiveness, the correctness or the accuracy of the respondent's selection process, but rather to determine whether this process was tainted with discrimination, which, according to my assessment of the evidence filed, is not the case here.\n[73] Mr. Ben Salem's complaint is dismissed.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario) May 8, 2008\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T1190\/0207\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Jamel Ben Salem v.

Grant Sinclair\nCharter Challenge\n[1] The Respondent, Jason Ouwendyk, has filed a Notice of his intention to question the constitutional applicability, validity and effect of ss. 13, 54(1) and 54(1.1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. He alleges that these provisions violate ss. 2(a), 2(b), 2(d) and 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and that they are not saved by s. 1 thereof.\n[2] The Tribunal invited the parties to file submissions as to how the question would be addressed during the hearing process. Mr. Ouwendyk suggests that the matter should proceed as in the Warman v. Lemire case, Tribunal File T1073\/5405. This is a case dealing with another s. 13 complaint in which the respondent has raised a virtually identical Charter challenge regarding the same provisions of the Act. In that case, the evidence with respect to the constitutional issue as well as on the merits of the complaint was heard together. After a total of more than five weeks of hearings, the parties (which include a number of interested third parties and the Attorney General of Canada) are scheduled to make their final arguments in June 2008.\n[3] Given that there are other cases in addition to Warman v. Lemire where the constitutionality of these provisions is being challenged, and that the outcome of these cases may come to fruition before the end of the present case, the Commission submits that the constitutional issue be dealt with in a separate hearing after the evidence regarding the complaint's allegations has been heard and a finding is made thereon.\n[4] A similar issue arose in respect of the judicial review before the Federal Court regarding the Tribunal decision in Warman v. Kulbashian et al., Tribunal File T869\/1903 and Court File no. T-572-06. The respondents in that case challenged the constitutional validity of the same sections of the Act that Mr. Ouwendyk is challenging in the present case, but they brought forward their challenge for the first time before the Federal Court. The matter had not been raised before the Tribunal. The Commission and the Attorney General of Canada argued that the judicial review should be stayed pending the outcome of the Lemire case. The Court agreed, stating that a stay of the present proceedings is appropriate on the grounds that the sole issue raised in the Applicants' Amended Notice of Application is currently the subject of adjudication before a tribunal in the Lemire matter (See 2007 FC 354, at para. 42). Among the factors considered by the Court were the risk of inconsistent findings, excessive costs and the capacity of the Court to grant the complete or comprehensive remedy. The Court noted that the Tribunal's disposition of the Lemire case, including any subsequent application for judicial review, will be available for the guidance of the Court when the Kulbashian et al. matter proceeds.\n[5] These factors are equally relevant to the present case. For the same reasons cited by the Court, it would be inappropriate to proceed with a virtually identical constitutional challenge as in the Lemire case.\n[6] The Tribunal therefore directs that the hearing into this complaint should proceed at this time, but solely on the evidence regarding the complaint's allegations. The hearing on the question of the constitutional validity of the impugned sections of the Act will be deferred pending the outcome in Lemire. If the complaint is substantiated, the Tribunal will not issue any order until the final determination by the Courts of the constitutional question.\nMotion to deny the issuance of subpoenas\n[7] The Respondent has requested that the Tribunal issue subpoenas for six Commission employees and a former Canadian Human Rights Tribunal member. The Respondent proposes to call these witnesses in support of their Charter challenge.\n[8] The Commission has filed a motion seeking an order denying this request. Given this decision to defer the hearing on the constitutional question, neither the Respondents' request nor the Commission's motion need be addressed at this time.\nSigned by\nJ.

INTRODUCTION [1] James Smith is the complainant in this case. He is a locomotive engineer with the Canadian National Railway (CN), but has not worked in this position since 2001.\n[2] Mr. Smith began working for CN as a brakeman in Edmonton in 1979. In 1981, he moved to Prince George, British Columbia, as a conductor\/brakeman. In 1987, he qualified and began working as a locomotive engineer with CN.\n[3] In 1989, Mr. Smith moved to Terrace, British Columbia, where he currently resides with his wife. They very much like living in Terrace. Mrs. Smith works as a library assistant for the local school board. She is qualified as a pharmacist. His children have left home.\nA. Mr. Smith's Back Injury [4] The history of events which ultimately led to Mr. Smith filing a discrimination complaint on February 28, 2002, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission began on November 17, 1997. It was on that day that he injured his back removing a derail (weighing about 60 lbs.) so that he could drive a locomotive out of the CN shops in Prince Rupert. As he described it, something went in my back.\nB. Mr. Smith's Return to Work Post Injury [5] Mr. Smith went off work on November 17, 1997. He consulted with his doctor, Dr. Appleton who filed an attending physician's report with the Worker's Compensation Board (WCB) on November 20, 1997, indicating that Mr. Smith had acute lower back problems. Dr. Appleton estimated his expected return to work to be on November 27, 1997. Mr. Smith filed a claim with the WCB on November 25, 1997.\n[6] During the time he was off work, Mr. Smith attended the Skeena Work Conditioning Clinic. According to the Clinic's February 18, 1998 report, Mr. Smith was fit to return to his pre-injury duties without limitations.\n[7] Mr. Smith did return to work on February 27, 1998. After he returned to work, he reported problems sitting because of pain in his left leg and lower back. As a locomotive engineer, he would spend most of the time sitting when operating the engine, doing runs from Terrace to other locations on the CN northern line such as Prince George, Prince Rupert, Smithers and Kitimat.\n[8] Mr. Smith went off work again on February 19, 1999. Because of his worsening condition, Dr. Appleton arranged for Mr. Smith to have back surgery, (a lumbar discectomy left L5-S1 disc) which was performed in Vancouver on March 12, 1999, by Dr. Padilla. According to Mr. Smith the surgery improved his condition. The pain he had been experiencing was considerably reduced.\n[9] After his operation, Mr. Smith attempted a number of return-to-work plans developed in conjunction with WCB and CN over the period 2000 to 2004. Three of the plans were designed to return Mr. Smith to his pre-injury job of engineer. The later two plans involved retraining Mr. Smith to work as a traffic coordinator\/assistant traffic coordinator in Prince George. To do this job, Mr. Smith would have to relocate from Terrace to Prince George.\n[10] None of these return-to-work plans were successful. Mr. Smith stopped working as an engineer in March 2001. He has never returned to work for CN, although he remains on CN's employee roster without pay or benefits.\nII. ISSUES [11] The issues in this case as defined by Mr. Smith in his Statement of Particulars are as follows:\nDid CN discriminate against Mr. Smith on the grounds of his disability and family status by failing to accommodate him with suitable employment in the Terrace area; Did CN discriminate and\/or retaliate against Mr. Smith for pursuing his complaint by misrepresenting to the WCB the suitability of the accommodations offered to him as a locomotive engineer and as a traffic coordinator in Prince George; by misrepresenting the medical difficulties he experienced while training in Prince George; and by misrepresenting his ability to complete the two traffic coordinators programs in Prince George; Did CN discriminate and\/or retaliate against Mr. Smith when it rejected his application for a CN disability retirement pension.\n[12] As to Mr. Smith's claim that he should be accommodated in Terrace, this is the third legal proceeding in which Mr. Smith has raised this question. The first was pursuant to a grievance filed by Mr. Smith's Union, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers on June 26, 2002. This grievance was dismissed in arbitration on July 14, 2003.\n[13] The second was by way of his appeal to the Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal heard on November 29, 2005. In its February 10, 2006 decision, WCAT also rejected Mr. Smith's contention that CN should accommodate him in Terrace.\n[14] Nonetheless, Mr. Smith now brings the same issue before this Tribunal.\nIII. DECISION [15] I have concluded that:\nCN did accommodate Mr. Smith through the three modified return-to-work programs designed to bring Mr. Smith back to service as a locomotive engineer in Terrace. And subsequently by offering him the position of traffic\/assistant coordinator in Prince George. CN did not discriminate or retaliate against Mr. Smith in its dealings with the WCB. The evidence does not support the conclusion that Mr. Smith is totally and permanently disabled from engaging in any employment. CN did not discriminate or retaliate against Mr. Smith by refusing him a disability pension.\n[16] Mr. Smith's complaint is dismissed.\nIV. FINDINGS OF FACT A. Attempts to Return Mr. Smith to his Pre-Injury Job [17] Mr. Smith told Connie Araujo, his WCB case manager, of the difficulties he had with his return to work. She asked Dr. McDougall, a WCB Medical Advisor, to review Mr. Smith's medical evidence on file and advise her whether Mr. Smith had any permanent functional impairment which would prevent a return to work as an engineer.\n[18] Dr. McDougall, in his September 29, 1999 report, noted that Mr. Smith reported that he was still having problems with sitting, which is a large part of his pre-injury job. He could not answer at this point whether Mr. Smith could return as an engineer.\n[19] Dr. McDougall recommended certain restrictions for Mr. Smith, namely, avoid heavy or repetitive lifting, avoid twisting and bending and change positions from sitting to standing to walking when working.\n[20] WCB arranged with the WorkAble Centre in Terrace to visit the job site to examine the physical demands associated with both the engineer and brakeman\/conductor positions in CN. This was partly in response to Mr. Smith's earlier request to move to a conductor\/brakeman job.\n[21] Karen Chasney, a registered occupational therapist with WorkAble, visited the Terrace job site on October 7, 1999. In her October 21, 1999 report, Ms. Chasney provided a detailed description of the duties and responsibilities of both positions. She also reported on the concerns Mr. Smith expressed to her at their meeting on October 8, 1999, about returning to work as an engineer.\n[22] In her report, Ms. Chasney did not support Mr. Smith moving to a conductor\/brakeman position because of the high risk for re-injury. She recommended that Mr. Smith could do his pre-injury job, initially starting as an extra to build his tolerance for the job and a graduated return-to-work plan be coordinated with CN, WCB and Mr. Smith. She also suggested that Mr. Smith alternate his position between sitting and standing when driving the locomotive.\n[23] In a number of WCB attending physician reports between September and November 1999, Dr. Appleton noted that Mr. Smith reported that his symptoms remained unchanged and that he continued to have problems with prolonged sitting. Dr. Appleton had doubts whether Mr. Smith could alter his position sufficiently when driving the engine as suggested in the WorkAble report.\n[24] Mr. Smith returned to work on December 13, 1999, on a run from Terrace to Kitimat. He was able to make the outbound trip but could not do the return trip. Instead he took a taxi home from Kitimat to Terrace.\n[25] Dr. Appleton examined Mr. Smith early in January 2000. Mr. Smith had reported a lot of pain when sitting for more than 20-30 minutes, depending on the chair. Dr. Appleton's view was that Mr. Smith could not do the engineer's job because of the prolonged sitting.\n[26] Ms. Araujo arranged for another WCB medical consultant, Dr. Naismith who examined Mr. Smith on January 28, 2000. Mr. Smith told Dr. Naismith that the main physical demands of his job were sitting and the safe operation of the locomotive. If sitting for more than 2 hours, he would develop pain in his back.\n[27] Dr. Naismith did not think that Mr. Smith's injury was a medical contra-indication to any activity within his symptoms. He felt that Mr. Smith's description of his restricted sitting tolerance was biologically plausible. But his sitting tolerance and the pain he experienced could not be measured medically. He did agree with Dr. Appleton to restrict the amount of sitting to reasonable levels of comfort.\n[28] The referrals to specialists continued. On February 17, 2000, Dr. F. Gouws, a WCB medical advisor, referred Mr. Smith to Dr. Wing, an orthopedic surgeon, for further medical examination. Dr. Wing examined Mr. Smith on May 5, 2000. In his medical report, Dr. Wing did not recommend any further surgery. He felt that Mr. Smith could do some type of work and suggested a modified return-to-work program. If Mr. Smith was not able to work as an engineer, an alternative occupation should be considered.\n[29] In July 2000, Todd McDonald, a WCB vocational rehabilitation consultant, became involved with Mr. Smith's claim. He wanted to consider a graduated return-to-work plan (RTWP) and asked Erin Fawcett, a CN claims officer, to contact CN safety officials to determine whether it would be a safety issue for Mr. Smith to stand while operating a locomotive engine. Erin Fawcett confirmed that the CN Safety Department did not consider this to be a safety issue.\nB. RTWP No. 1 - December 2000 - Locomotive Engineer [30] Mr. McDonald asked CN to develop a graduated RTWP and CN retained Karlene Dawson, a certified kinesiologist and disability management professional, to do this. Ms. Dawson prepared a RTWP which was reviewed and agreed to by WCB and CN.\n[31] In preparing this RTWP for Mr. Smith, Ms. Dawson consulted with Mr. Smith's supervisor in Terrace about the engineer's job duties; reviewed information from the WCB relating to any medical limitations or contra-indications for Mr. Smith returning to his pre-injury job; she also reviewed the October 21, 1999, WorkAble Report which outlined the physical demands of the job and its recommendations for Mr. Smith.\n[32] On August 22, 2000, Ms. Dawson spoke to Mr. Smith about the return-to-work plan she was developing for him. They talked about his tolerances, how long he can sit or stand. He told her that he could drive for about two hours at one time, and currently he was doing about five hours of home exercise. He also told her that as long as he continued with his exercises his back felt not too bad.\n[33] Ms. Dawson provided the RTWP to Mr. Smith on September 8, 2000. She asked him to review it and provide her with any comments or concerns. He thought it was a little too aggressive and was unsure if he was able to do it. Ms. Dawson was surprised. She thought that the information she had plus what Mr. Smith told her about his tolerances accorded with the RTWP.\n[34] Mr. Smith consulted again with Dr. Wing on October 23, 2000. Ms. Araujo had sent Dr. Wing the draft RTWP for Mr. Smith and asked for his comments. Dr. Wing's view was that the plan was totally appropriate for Mr. Smith. He recommended that Mr. Smith move and change positions from time to time when he is working.\n[35] The RTWP was to commence on December 12, 2000. Mr. Smith would do two trips per week in week one and week two of the plan. He would have three days off during these weeks so that he could rest and continue with his home exercises.\n[36] His work week would progressively increase so that he would add a trip in each subsequent week. During this period, Mr. Smith would be the fourth person on a three-man crew, which meant that he did not have the primary responsibility for the operation of the locomotive. The plan also provided he should alternate between sitting and standing as required.\n[37] Under the plan, Mr. Smith was required to keep a diary of his experience and fax it weekly to CN Occupational Health Services. He was to record his tasks, any physical symptoms and if the symptoms increased or decreased, so that the necessary modifications could be made.\n[38] On December 15, 2000, Ms. Dawson wrote to Dr. Appleton, about the spasms that Mr. Smith had told her he experienced when operating the engine. She included with her letter a physical demands analysis of the engineer's job and Mr. Smith's RTWP. She asked Dr. Appleton to comment on the spasms and provide an opinion whether the spasms resulted from any underlying medical condition that would affect his position as a locomotive engineer.\n[39] In his December 19, 2000 response, Dr. Appleton indicated that Mr. Smith was fit for graduated return to work as outlined and that his medical condition was stable. Dr. Appleton also suggested that Mr. Smith must be able to move around frequently, and prolonged sitting is a contra-indicator.\n[40] Mr. Smith returned to work on December 12, 2000. He did the Terrace to Kitimat run on December 12, 14 and 19, alternating between sitting and standing. On December 21, he only did the outbound run.\n[41] On December 28, 2000, Mr. Smith was scheduled for the Kitimat run. When he was sitting in the engine waiting to leave, he experienced intense spasms. He had to get off the engine and lay on the floor of the yard office. His wife came and took him to the hospital. He was examined, given medication and released.\n[42] Mr. Smith was able to make the return run from Terrace to Kitimat on December 29. But on the Terrace\/Kitimat run on January 2, 2001, he reported that his spasms were so frequent and intense that he could not make the return trip. He took a taxi back to Terrace lying on the back seat all the way. Mr. Smith was unable to complete this RTWP.\n[43] On January 24, 2001, Dr. Trent Faraday, WCB medical consultant, was asked for his medical opinion as to whether there were any significant changes from January 2000 in Mr. Smith's medical condition. He replied on January 25, 2001, that there had not been any objective change in Mr. Smith's medical condition.\n[44] Dr. Faraday also confirmed Mr. Smith's physical work restrictions to be:\navoid lifting greater than 30 pounds\navoid prolonged sitting\navoid excessive pushing, pulling, carrying and bending activities\nhave the ability to change positions from sitting, standing and walking as required\n[45] Dr. Faraday concluded that Mr. Smith should complete the RTWP developed by Ms. Dawson and approved by Dr. Wing.\nC. RTWP No. 2 - March 2001 - Locomotive Engineer [46] Prior to the December 2000 RTWP, Mr. Smith had suggested to CN that he return to work as an engineer, doing yard work in the Terrace Yard. After the first RTWP failed and in response to Mr. Smith's suggestion, Ms. Dawson developed another plan. WCB was not involved in this RTWP. It was done on CN's initiative.\n[47] This RTWP provided that Mr. Smith would work in the yard office, spend two hours on the yard engine and another hour in the yard office. He would work as an extra person and was to try as many duties as possible during the term of the plan.\n[48] The plan was transitional, with Mr. Smith gradually increasing the hours and shifts worked in each week. Mr. Smith could take breaks as necessary, as he was working as an extra person on the crew.\n[49] The RTWP was to start in March 2001, to run two to four weeks. Dr. Coppin, a CN medical advisor, wrote to Dr. Appleton enclosing the RTWP. Dr. Coppin pointed out that this RTWP provided for modified duties and was limited to local yard work which would avoid prolonged periods in the locomotive cab. He asked for Dr. Appleton's support. Dr. Appleton agreed to this plan.\n[50] Dr. Appleton wrote in his clinical notes on March 6, 2001, that Mr. Smith, his Union representative and CN representatives had met and agreed to another RTWP which did not involve significant engineer's work. Dr. Appleton considered this to be a reasonable offer and had discussed this at length with Mr. Smith.\n[51] Mr. Smith started on March 1, 2001. But he was not able to complete the plan. On March 28, 2001, there was a meeting in Terrace between Ms. Dawson, Mr. Smith, his Union representative Wayne Wiederspiel, and the Terrace CN Superintendent, Darren Payment. At this meeting, they discussed the fact that Mr. Smith wasn't making much progress. He had difficulty operating the locomotive and wasn't able to continue at the pace that was outlined. All agreed that the RTWP should be terminated.\n[52] Mr. Smith said that he had no problem with the yard office duties. He was able to move around. But operating the yard engine caused him difficulty. He experienced pain and muscle spasms when his hours on the engine increased.\n[53] After the March 28, 2001 meeting, Mr. Wiederspiel offered some suggestions to Ms. Dawson that could assist Mr. Smith to return to his pre-injury job. These included putting a rubber mat in the locomotive engine to dampen the engine vibration, removing the back of the engine cab seat so that Mr. Smith could kneel on the seat when operating the engine. He also made recommendations concerning Mr. Smith taking rest breaks. Mr. Wiederspeil asked that CN reactivate the March RTWP and include some of his suggestions.\nD. RTWP No. 3 - April 2001 - Locomotive Engineer [54] CN agreed. Ms. Dawson drafted another RTWP in consultation with Mr. Wiederspiel. The previous RTWP was modified to include rubber matting, ensuring that Mr. Smith had supportive, comfortable safety boots when working; sitting, standing or kneeling as necessary, and removing the back of the seat in the locomotive engine cab.\n[55] Ms. Dawson sent a copy of this RTWP to Mr. Smith on April 26, 2001. He reviewed the plan and sent back his comments including some modifications which Ms. Dawson put into the plan.\n[56] According to Ms. Dawson, at no time did Mr. Smith indicate that he was not able to carry out this RTWP. In fact, he clearly gave the impression in his communication with Ms. Dawson that he was prepared to move ahead with it.\n[57] Ms. Dawson also sent a copy to Dr. Appleton on April 26, 2001, explaining the modifications and asked for his support. Dr. Appleton's response on May 22 was that he was concerned that the locomotive cab is too confined to allow Mr. Smith to vary his position. Dr. Appleton doubted whether there would be any further improvement in Mr. Smith's condition and he should look for alternate employment. Dr. Appleton rejected the plan and Mr. Smith never started it.\n(i) The July 12, 2001 Meeting - Attempt to Resolve Mr. Smith's Situation [58] On June 14, 2001, Dr. Appleton wrote to Ken Beddie, Manager of the WCB Terrace office, seeking a meeting to try to resolve Mr. Smith's situation. He had asked Ms. Araujo to arrange a meeting but she declined. Dr. Appleton said that he was quite incensed by this. Thus his letter to Ken Beddie. It was his medical opinion that Mr. Smith could not resume his engineer job as it required a lot of either standing or sitting for prolonged periods. He felt that a meeting was the only way to resolve the issue.\n[59] A meeting was held on July 12, 2001 in Terrace. In attendance was Mr. Smith and Dr. Appleton; Karlene Dawson, Murray Swanson, Dr. Faraday, Dr. Vaney, all from CN; Ken Beddie, Connie Araujo and Vivien Millin, a WCB vocational rehabilitation consultant.\n[60] There was discussion about the failed attempts to return Mr. Smith to his pre-injury position. Ms. Dawson advised that CN and the Union were looking for alternative work for Mr. Smith, but due to cutbacks in the area, there were no options. But if Mr. Smith was willing to relocate, CN would be able to accommodate him in a different job.\n[61] On March 30, 2001, Dr. Appleton had written to Dr. Clarke, a neurologist, asking him to assess Mr. Smith. He asked Dr. Clarke if he could identify physiological or psychological causes for Mr. Smith's symptoms.\n[62] Mr. Smith had seen Dr. Clarke on July 11, 2001, but had not yet sent his medical report to Dr. Appleton. They wanted to wait for Dr. Clarke's report and they also agreed that it would be useful for Mr. Smith to have a functional capacity assessment.\n[63] CN was to pay for this and it was up to CN to find available facilities and arrange for the assessment.\n(ii) Dr. Clarke's Assessment [64] In his July 11, 2001 medical report, Dr. Clarke reported a number of medical findings about Mr. Smith. These included what Mr. Smith reported as his concerns, namely, back spasms that he had experienced intermittently since 1997. Mr. Smith told Dr. Clarke that his spasms occurred after sitting between 20-60 minutes, depending on the chair, or if standing between 30-60 minutes. He also told Dr. Clarke that if he did not sit or stand for a prolonged period, he had very few back spasms. His self treatment is to lie on his back on a hot pad and that works well. He also reported to Dr. Clarke that he was quite active, walking from his home to the swimming pool, swimming about 40 laps regularly and doing some yard work at home.\n[65] Dr. Clarke's assessment was that Mr. Smith has a pretty normal neurological exam and does not have a lot of non-organic features. If he carefully manages his activities and does not sit or stand for prolonged periods of time, he is relatively comfortable and can function pretty well.\n[66] Dr. Clarke concluded that, given his history of recurrent spasms since 1997 and the requirement of his job to sit and stand for prolonged periods, it is unlikely that he could return to his pre-injury job and would be a good candidate for retraining.\n[67] In his February 14, 2002 clinical notes in reference to Dr. Clarke's assessment, Dr. Appleton noted that neither he nor Dr. Clarke are able to decipher the exact nature of Mr. Smith's muscle spasms or cause.\n(iii) The CN Temporary Job Offer - July 16, 2001 [68] Both Dr. Appleton and Mr. Smith were concerned that Mr. Smith had not received any income for some time. Rob Reny, CN Senior Manager Human Resources for Western Canada, had ongoing discussions with Dan Shewchuk, Vice-Chair of the Union, about Mr. Smith's return-to-work programs and what the next steps should be.\n[69] At the July 12, 2001 meeting, CN was asked if it would offer Mr. Smith short term work to alleviate some of Mr. Smith's financial problems, pending Dr. Clarke's assessment.\n[70] CN offered Mr. Smith three weeks employment in the Terrace yard and Mr. Swanson told him that he was to report to work on July 16, 2001.\n[71] Mr. Smith emailed Mr. Swanson later that day asking for an outline as to the proposed duties. He asked for the outline because he wanted to get Dr. Appleton's approval for the job duties. It is not clear why he needed this since Dr. Appleton was at the meeting when the temporary job was discussed.\n[72] Mr. Swanson emailed Mr. Smith on July 16, 2001 with an outline of the duties. The duties included doing sedentary desk duties, doing an inventory of office and stationery supplies, driving anywhere between 20 minutes to two hours in the yard with the opportunity to get out of the vehicle and stretch during stops, and walking to assist with the inspection of trains in the yard, which walking would not exceed one kilometre.\n[73] Mr. Smith did not report for work on July 16 as scheduled. Mr. Swanson called Mr. Smith on July 16 and left a message on Mr. Smith's answering machine saying that the outline had been sent to him. He also left a phone message on August 10 asking Mr. Smith to contact him about why he had not shown up for work.\n[74] Initially, Mr. Smith told CN that he did not get Mr. Swanson's email until August 23. He told CN that he did not recall getting Mr. Swanson's phone messages.\n[75] At the Tribunal hearing, Mr. Smith testified that he had not been honest with CN. He did receive the list of duties on his email on July 16. He did receive at least one of Mr. Swanson's phone messages. In fact, he was away on holidays with his wife and did not return until late August. Mr. Smith did not want CN to know that he went on vacation with his wife instead of reporting for work.\n(iv) Mr. Smith's Functional Capacity Evaluation - October\/November 2002 [76] Mr. Smith's functional capacity evaluation occurred on October 3, 8 and 21, 2002. It was done by Julie Veillleux, an occupational therapist. Ms. Veilleux tested Mr. Smith's functional capacity and his physical abilities. She also made two job site visits to review the tasks and physical demands of the locomotive engineer position.\n[77] The first site visit was at the Terrace yard and included a run from Kitimat to Terrace on a locomotive engine. The second site visit was at the Thornton CN yard in Vancouver. The purpose was to look at other types of CN locomotives that CN operates.\n[78] In her November 6, 2002 vocational analysis report, Ms. Veilleux concluded that there was a good match between Mr. Smith's physical abilities and the physical demands of the engineer job. Her overall conclusion, however, was that she was not able to determine with reasonable confidence whether Mr. Smith was capable of working full time as an engineer. She noted that Mr. Smith had not been able to successfully complete three previous RTW programs. But there was no objective evidence to explain why. She proposed another RTWP to be closely monitored by medical rehabilitation professionals.\n(v) Other Job Possibilities in Terrace [79] Over the period from April, 2001 to May, 2003, there were discussions with CN about job possibilities for Mr. Smith in Terrace. Daryl Payment, Superintendent of Operations in Terrace, was asked about employing Mr. Smith in a taxi operation for the train crews. His response was that because there were a limited number of trains running in the B.C. north, it was not a feasible suggestion. Mr. Payment could not think of any other positions for Mr. Smith in Terrace.\n[80] In February, 2003, Mr. Smith had talked to Judy McKenzie, a CN personnel officer, about potential employment opportunities in Terrace. He suggested that he could drive train crews around the Terrace terminal or set up a website for CN or do computer work, or set up an Operation Lifesave Program for the local schools.\n[81] CN's position was that the Terrace terminal was a small location with very few offices or sedentary positions necessary to Mr. Smith's restrictions. With the downturn in economic activity in the Terrace area, the volume of traffic for CN was reduced significantly. Many of the non-running positions had been eliminated or transferred to other larger CN terminals such as Prince George, Edmonton or Vancouver.\n[82] As to setting up websites, CN's websites are provided by an external service provider or CN's Information Technology group in Montreal.\n[83] CN contracted with a taxi service to drive crews around the terminal. This would involve a lot of sitting. Further, it would not lead to full-time employment.\n[84] The operational people in Terrace and Mr. Smith's return-to-work team, all experienced and knowledgeable about CN's operation in Terrace, had been canvassed extensively for job possibilities in Terrace. There were no opportunities in Terrace to accommodate Mr. Smith other than creating a position that was not otherwise required.\n[85] CN's objective was to try to find full-time, gainful employment for Mr. Smith that would keep him employed over the long term, not create work projects. The suggestions provided by Mr. Smith regarding his employment at the Terrace location did not lend themselves to meaningful, long-term employment.\nE. Mr. Smith's Appeal to WCB Review Board - Decision - March 14, 2003 [86] In January 2002, Mr. Smith appealed to the WCB Review Tribunal regarding a number of decisions that the WCB officers had made relating to his injury claim. One of the issues before the Review Tribunal was whether modified employment as a locomotive engineer was suitable for Mr. Smith. The Review Tribunal concluded in its March 14, 2003 decision on this question that Mr. Smith's pre-injury job as modified was not suitable given his compensable condition.\n[87] The Tribunal concluded that the ideal job for Mr. Smith would allow him to sit, stand and walk as required. Standing while operating a locomotive is limited and there is little opportunity to walk around.\n[88] The Review Tribunal awarded Mr. Smith vocational rehabilitation benefits and a loss of earnings award. It gave the option to WCB and CN to consider another position with CN or retraining him in a different vocation.\nF. RTWP - June\/July 2003 - Traffic Coordinator in Prince George [89] On April 15, 2003, shortly after the WCB Review Board decision, Todd McDonald, WCB Vocational Rehabilitation Consultant in Terrace, wrote to Tom Brown, Superintendent, CN Operations at Prince George.\n[90] He suggested that WCB and CN move to vocational rehabilitation for Mr. Smith within the work restrictions that the WCB medical advisor had earlier confirmed.\n[91] Mr. Brown replied to Mr. McDonald on May 7, 2003, offering to train Mr. Smith as a traffic coordinator in Prince George, B.C. This would consist of technical training in Vancouver and on the job training in Prince George. He believed that the position would provide Mr. Smith with optimum employment stability. He also noted that this job is for the most part sedentary and well within Mr. Smith's work restrictions.\nG. RTWP No. 4 - Traffic Coordinator - Prince George, June\/July 2003 [92] Tanya Gordon, who was now the CN return to work coordinator developed another transitional return-to-work plan for Mr. Smith, this time for the position of traffic coordinator at Prince George. Ms. Gordon is a registered kinesiologist with a speciality in vocational rehabilitation and disability management.\n[93] The RTWP provided for CN sponsored training sessions, both at the Thornton Yard, Vancouver, for the technical, training from June 2 to June 27, 2003, and from June 29 to July 28 at Prince George for on-site practical training.\n[94] In developing this RTWP, Ms. Gordon considered a number of factors such as the WCB designated work restrictions for Mr. Smith; the physical demands and working conditions, job analysis for the traffic coordinator and Mr. Smith's October 2002 functional capacity evaluation.\n(i) Duties of a Traffic Coordinator [95] Traffic coordinators in Prince George are solely responsible for the operation of the Prince George Yard. They control the breakdown of trains entering the terminal and the building of trains exiting the terminal. They direct the yard crews in these yard operations. They are the contact for any customer issues and are the emergency contact within the Prince George terminal.\n[96] The traffic coordinator works in an office setting. They may sit or stand at their desk. With the flexibility of the cell phone and portable radio, they are not required always to be at their desk. They can go outside in the yard, take a break, but must stay in radio or phone contact.\n[97] The equipment used by the traffic coordinator includes a computer connected to the CN network, a portable radio, a radio at their desk, telephone, a cell phone, and a bank of monitors over the desk to monitor the yard operations via a set of cameras.\n[98] The physical tasks for a traffic coordinator include entering data on the computer, reading data on a computer screen, watching the monitors and operating the radio or phone. These tasks can be done either sitting or standing.\n[99] The heaviest thing a traffic coordinator may lift is a phone. It is one of the most sedentary of CN railroad jobs.\n[100] Traffic coordinator is a safety critical position. They are the contact for any emergency in the yard or if a road crew within the area has an emergency. For this reason, it is critical that the traffic coordinator be accessible for the entire shift.\n(ii) Mr. Smith's Concerns re: the RTWP for Traffic Coordinator [101] Initially, Mr. Smith was not in favor of this proposal. He told Mr. McDonald that he wanted CN to consider positions in Terrace before he would consider moving to Prince George. One of his reasons was that his wife's job was very important to her and she would not want to move.\n[102] Prior to the commencement of the plan, Ms. Gordon discussed it with Mr. Smith. He had some concerns with the date that the plan was to start, that it was too rushed and that he had family commitments in June when he needed to be in Terrace. He also had concerns about how the training was to be undertaken, and that the training was to be done in Vancouver and not in Terrace.\n[103] Ms. Gordon explained to Mr. Smith that the training materials and the training personnel were only available at Thornton Yard. Access to these resources was necessary.\n[104] She also told Mr. Smith he would be paid the wage rate for a traffic coordinator during the training, and CN expected him to be on site for eight hours a day. Or if not in training, then at least at the gym doing his exercise program.\n[105] CN would pay for his accommodation, transportation to and from Terrace and a per diem for expenses. As to his family commitments in June, Ms. Gordon adjusted the schedule so that he would be able to meet these commitments.\nH. The Technical Training - Traffic Coordinator - Thornton Yard - Vancouver, June 2003 [106] Mr. Smith ultimately agreed to proceed with the RTWP although he continued to maintain that CN should accommodate him in Terrace.\n[107] For its part, the Union accepted that Mr. Smith was capable of working as a traffic coordinator. The Union, however asked CN, no doubt at the urging of Mr. Smith, that Mr. Smith be given the traffic coordinator position in Terrace.\n[108] CN could not agree to this. There was no operational requirement for a traffic coordinator in Terrace. The traffic coordinator in Prince George coordinated the Terrace terminal and the Edmonton traffic coordinator controlled the rail movement in the other centers outside of Prince George and Vancouver.\n[109] Besides the lack of operational needs, it is not feasible for CN to have a single traffic coordinator in Terrace because it is a safety critical position and requires 24 hour\/seven days\/week coverage.\n[110] The WCB, through Mr. McDonald, was in favour of training Mr. Smith for this position in Prince George and encouraged Mr. Smith to move forward. Ms. Gordon had provided Mr. McDonald with the RTWP and he approved it.\n(i) Phase One of the RTWP - Thornton Yard, Vancouver [111] The RTWP was divided into two phases, classroom training at Thornton Yard and practical training in Prince George.\n[112] For the first week, Mr. Smith was to do six hours of training. He had ample opportunity to get up, take breaks, walk around and change position when required. He had two hours each day to access the employee fitness centre, within walking distance from the office.\n[113] Mr. Smith was to start at 8:30 and finish at 2:30, increasing to eight hours per day in the second week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This would allow him to increase his tolerances and his endurance for working a full eight-hour shift.\n[114] WCB had final approval over the RTWP and the final decision as to the suitability of the position. Mr. McDonald had requested weekly reports from Ms. Gordon as to how the plan was progressing and if there were any problems that needed to be addressed by WCB.\n[115] Mr. Smith started his training on June 2, 2003. On June 6, 2003, Ms. Gordon met with Mr. Smith. He told her that he did not believe he was receiving the proper training as it was not in a classroom environment. She explained that the WCB wanted to expedite his return to work, the training was otherwise given only once per year and he would receive the full training for a traffic coordinator.\n[116] Mr. Smith was provided with the training modules for the traffic coordinator position and one-on-one access to a manager familiar with the materials. He was also given access to the computer systems he would be working with in the position.\n[117] Mr. Smith asked to be given a chair that that could accommodate his back problems. CN offered him several chairs in the office, including a receptionist chair, a steno chair, a high back Obusforme chair, but he was not able to find one that was suitable.\n[118] Mr. Smith felt that CN did not make sufficient effort to find him an appropriate chair. He even offered to accompany a CN official to a chair store. But he would only do so during working hours, not after his shift ended. In the end, he asked that CN transport his personal chair from home to Vancouver and CN did so.\n[119] According to CN, the chairs that were available to him were all chairs that met or exceeded the current ergonomic standards. They all had height adjustable backs, height adjustable seat pans and height adjustable arms.\n[120] His personal chair was one piece in nature, without an adjustable back, arm rests or seat pans. The only modification that Mr. Smith did was to put an Obusforme cushion support for his back. His chair did not meet any of the recommended ergonomic standards.\na) Mr. Smith's Diaries [121] A key part of the RTWP was that Mr. Smith was to keep a daily diary to record the tasks he had completed and any symptoms he experienced before, during and after the tasks were completed. He was to inform Ms. Gordon, (she provided her direct line and her pager number) so that if Mr. Smith was having difficulty, the plan could be modified.\n[122] Mr. Smith reported in his diaries that from day one, he experienced pain and back spasms as the day progressed. He dealt with this by walking around or taking medication or lying down in a meeting room. Sometimes he would return to his hotel and lie down on a heating pad which would relieve his spasms.\n[123] As his training progressed, he reported that his spasms and back pain increased. By week three, he reported that his left leg was aching, and would get numb, and his gait was noticeably affected. Sometimes he would have to leave early and return to his hotel to lie down on a heating pad.\n[124] Although asked to do so, Mr. Smith provided very few details about his daily tasks. Rather, he concentrated on reporting his comfort levels, the physical difficulties he was having and what he would do to relieve the pain and spasms he experienced.\n[125] Mr. Smith understood that the purpose for the diaries was so that Ms. Gordon and the RTW team would know what tasks aggravated his condition. His view was that he didn't think it necessary to provide more details because Ms. Gordon knew what he was working on. She could reference his supervisor's summaries and the weekly progress reports which were discussed at the weekly meetings.\n[126] Weekly meetings between Ms. Gordon, Mr. Smith and his supervisor\/trainers were part of the RTWP. At the June 13, 2003 meeting, a number of issues were discussed and a number of matters were raised by Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith felt he was progressing quite well through the training. He was beginning to understand the system and he found that the job shadowing with the traffic coordinators at Thornton Yard was quite helpful.\n[127] But he felt pressured working an eight hour day. Ms. Gordon pointed out that in week two he was only working eight-hour days on the Tuesday and Thursday, and the rest of the days were six-hour days, which he had successfully completed the first week.\n[128] Mr. Smith also voiced his concern about the frequency and difficulty with the back spasms he was having. Ms. Gordon told him that when he was having the back spasms or was just having a bad day overall, he could contact her and discuss options such as going to the fitness centre, going for a rest in the restroom, or going for a break to his hotel.\n[129] Ms. Gordon also told him that his job tasks were well within his restrictions. He did have the opportunity to get up, walk around and change positions as required.\n[130] Mr. Smith also told Ms. Gordon that he did not like having to eat out all the time. Ms. Gordon pointed out that his hotel had kitchen facilities and a fridge. Mr. Smith had the option of cooking his own meals, but he indicated that he did not like preparing meals just for one person.\n[131] At this meeting, Mr. Smith said that he did not like living in a hotel. He was having difficulty sleeping. Ms. Gordon told him that CN would not transport his bed from Terrace to Vancouver.\n[132] In Ms. Gordon's view, the concerns expressed by Mr. Smith confirmed the trend she was seeing over the course of developing the RTWP and during the first two weeks of training, whereby Mr. Smith would bring up barriers on a regular basis which were not related to the components of the plan.\n[133] In addition, his reports of back spasms were of particular concern because of the increasing frequency and length. The traffic coordinator position was safety critical and required Mr. Smith to be available at all times during the work shift. If he left the office to lie down or return to his hotel, he would not be able to respond to an emergency.\n(ii) Phase Two of the RTWP - Prince George - July 2003 [134] Mr. Smith completed the first phase of the RTWP on June 20, 2003, his last day at the Thornton Yard. At the weekly meeting on June 20, 2003, attended by Mr. Smith and the RTW team, Bruce Feltham, the manager in charge of Mr. Smith's training, reported that he believed Mr. Smith had acquired approximately 75 per cent of the skills and knowledge he needed to do the traffic coordinator job. He could acquire the rest through the hands-on experience in Prince George.\n[135] Dave Radford, CN Assistant Superintendent, Transportation, in Prince George had the overall responsibility for coordinating Mr. Smith's training program in Prince George, setting up the training shifts, monitoring and managing his development in the program. He arranged for Mr. Smith's accommodations in Prince George, his transportation back and forth from Terrace, as well as his transportation in Prince George to and from his hotel to the yard office.\n[136] Mr. Smith was assigned a supervisor whose role was to ensure that Mr. Smith obtained the correct training. His shifts were set up so that he would get a well-rounded overview of all that went on within the terminal, including the importance of the traffic coordinator being a 24-hour contact within the terminal.\n[137] Mr. Smith's training in Prince George started on July 2, 2003. Prior to that, near the end of June, Mr. Radford met with Mr. McDonald for a site tour of the terminal. The tour included the yard office, the traffic coordinator's work area where Mr. Smith would be working, and how the office would be renovated to accommodate him. Mr. Radford also explained the nature of the yard operations and the requirements for the position.\n[138] The renovations to the office area would consist of an adjustable height work station that would allow Mr. Smith to work both from a sitting or a standing position. He would be given an ergonomic chair and the office would be enlarged to accommodate this equipment.\n[139] Mr. Radford was committed to making the necessary expenditure but, because of the extensive renovations required, he wanted to wait until Mr. Smith was permanently in the job. In the interim, CN arranged to have his personal chair sent from Vancouver to Prince George.\n[140] Ms. Gordon had also explained to Mr. Smith that following the successful completion of the RTWP and confirmation of the permanent position, the necessary office equipment would be purchased and the office would be retrofitted.\n[141] Mr. Smith would work both weekdays and weekends. His scheduled hours were different from week to week to allow Mr. Smith to learn the different shifts and the different operating aspects of each shift.\na) Mr. Smith's Diaries [142] As before, Mr. Smith was to provide daily diary entries. He was to record the tasks completed, whether he encountered any difficulty and record any symptoms he experienced. Again, Mr. Smith concentrated on recording his pain levels and the symptoms he had experienced. Rarely did he indicate his tasks or relate his symptoms to the tasks.\n[143] On occasion, he used the diaries to express disagreement with Ms. Gordon, for example, as to his work restrictions and his compensable condition. In his July 2 diary entry, he asked Ms. Gordon to provide him with the job description and statement of duties for the traffic coordinator and its classification level and point rating.\n[144] Brad Butterwick, Mr. Smith's supervisor, recorded Mr. Smith's progress at Prince George. He reported to Tanya Gordon that from July 2 to July 5, Mr. Smith arrived on time for work and, apart from observing Mr. Smith leaning on the desk, he did not observe any issues with pain or back spasms.\n[145] That is, except for July 10, when Mr. Butterwick reported that he observed that Mr. Smith was shaking, sweating and was very pale. He was taken in a taxi to the local hospital emergency room, examined and released.\n[146] According to Mr. Smith's diaries, in the week of July 2, he left early on one of the five shifts. In the July 10 week, he left early in three of the five shifts. For the July 17-21 week, he left early on three of the five shifts. And in the week of July 25, he left early on one of the four shifts. He reported in his diaries that on those occasions, he experienced painful spasms.\n[147] At some point during this period, Terry Petry, a CN risk management officer and a member of the RTW team, asked Mr. Smith to provide more details of his tasks in his diaries. Mr. Smith's response was that he was doing the duties of a traffic coordinator. If he had to keep a minute to minute account of when he was sitting or moving around or went to the washroom etc., this would distract from the very purpose as to why he was at Prince George.\n[148] Mr. Petry also asked Mr. Smith whether he was committed to relocate to Prince George. Mr. Smith's position was that he was willing to relocate his family and home to Prince George, but under duress. Duress, because he did not believe that CN had exhausted or seriously considered his request to be accommodated in Terrace.\n[149] On July 22, 2003, Dr. Appleton wrote to Mr. McDonald. Mr. Petry had asked Mr. Smith for a letter from his doctor to explain the spasms. In his letter, Dr. Appleton reported that Mr. Smith told him that he developed back spasms on a regular basis. For relief, he would take medication, lie down, stretch and relax.\n[150] He also said that Mr. Smith told him that the traffic coordinator position required him to sit up to 95% of the time and that he had little opportunity to move around, walk or stretch. It is true that, on paper, the physical demands and working conditions analysis for traffic coordinator showed 95% sitting and 5% standing.\n[151] But this was not the case for Mr. Smith. He could sit, stand or walk around as required. In fact, in two or three of his diary entries, he recorded that he was able to move around, change positions and take walks outside.\n[152] Mr. McDonald replied to Dr. Appleton on September 10, 2003. He advised Dr. Appleton that he was misinformed about the 95% sitting requirement. The traffic coordinator's job was absolutely suitable for Mr. Smith. It did not require prolonged sitting. In fact, in his experience as a vocational rehabilitation consultant, he had never seen a job that had as much flexibility to alternate between sitting, standing and walking within the office or outside.\n[153] Ms. Gordon was becoming concerned about the increased frequency of his back spasms that Mr. Smith reported in his diaries and his need to lie down sometimes for up to an hour or more at a time. She was also concerned about the number of times he left work early.\n[154] She told Mr. Smith that his diaries did not provide the information required. Instead of detailing the job tasks that he was doing, he had taken to basically discussing his pain levels, his discomfort and what he did for that discomfort. She reminded him that the diaries were a way to track his daily activities and what activities seemed to be causing him problems.\n[155] Finally, on July 29, 2003, Dave Radford wrote to Mr. Smith advising him that, although CN believed he was capable of performing the duties of a traffic coordinator with some additional training, he had yet to demonstrate any real commitment to the job. He refused to follow instructions regarding his diary entries. He had a pattern of leaving his work area and\/or leaving his work unattended for non-work related issues, with increased frequency and duration as the plan progressed. Because of these issues together with the objective observations by his supervisors in Prince George, CN terminated this RTWP. Mr. Smith returned to Terrace.\n[156] On August 5, 2003, Ms. Gordon wrote a long letter to Mr. McDonald detailing the reasons why CN terminated the RTWP. She noted that Mr. Smith demonstrated the physical and mental ability to perform the traffic coordinator job. But in her view, he repeatedly placed obstacles in the way of his return to work that were not within the guidelines that WCB had provided to CN as to his physical capabilities and his compensable condition.\n[157] She referred to the frequency of his back spasms and Mr. Smith's self-imposed requirement that he lie down at work. Ms. Gordon noted that the traffic coordinator position allowed a great deal of flexibility for frequent breaks, for stretching, for short walks and for short periods to lie down. When working at his desk, Mr. Smith could perform his duties either standing or sitting. He could also walk outside for periods of time while doing non-desk duties, using a portable radio or cell phone.\n[158] Ms. Gordon also referred to Mr. Smith's inability to sometimes complete his shifts. The frequency of his early departures and time taken to lie on the floor negatively affected his on-site job training. The traffic coordinator is a safety critical position requiring him to be capable of responding to any emergency situation. Mr. Smith's need to leave the office or lie on the floor for extended periods of time would preclude him from responding to emergencies.\n[159] As to the level of commitment shown by Mr. Smith to the RTWP in Prince George, his supervisors noted his lack of interest and commitment to the plan. This was also reflected in his failure or refusal to provide more details in his diaries.\n[160] Ms. Gordon concluded that if these concerns could be resolved, CN was willing to continue with the RTWP leading to a permanent position of traffic coordinator.\n[161] Mr. Smith wrote a long response to the points raised by Ms. Gordon in his September 17, 2003 letter to Mr. McDonald. He pointed out that he did not choose his medical condition. He did experience muscle spasms and pain and could only recover with medication, heat and lying down.\n[162] On the question of his diaries, Mr. Smith's response was that he did report the duties he performed, the problems he was having with the work station and driving in the yard and the levels of pain he experienced. He said that he never received any feedback or response to the problems he noted.\n[163] Earlier, on August 18, 2003, Mr. Smith had written to Mr. McDonald demonstrating his commitment to relocating. He pointed that he had participated in the six week training program in Vancouver and Prince George. They had painted the exterior of their house in Terrace. He and his wife had driven around Prince George looking at real estate. Although they did not want to move, Mr. Smith believed that these actions demonstrated his determination and commitment to return to work.\nI. Mr. Smith's Union Grievance, June 2002 [164] It is noteworthy that while Mr. Smith was telling CN he was willing to relocate to Prince George, although under duress, he had asked his Union to file a grievance on his behalf as early as June 11, 2001. The Union did so on June 26, 2002. In its July 9, 2003 Statement of Issue submitted for arbitration, the Union's position was that Mr. Smith must be accommodated in his home terminal of Terrace. CN's failure to do so was a breach of the collective agreement and CN's obligation under the CHRA to properly accommodate him. The remedy requested was that CN accommodate Mr. Smith by way of appropriate employment at the Terrace terminal.\n[165] The grievance was dismissed. The issue for the arbitrator was whether CN had discharged its obligation under the CHRA to reasonably accommodate Mr. Smith's disability.\n[166] In his July 14, 2003 ruling, Arbitrator Pich\u00e9 accepted CN's position that there was no work of value to CN at Terrace that could be done by Mr. Smith. The duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship does not require CN to create a position of no productive value to it.\n[167] Arbitrator Pich\u00e9 concluded that CN's offer of the traffic coordinator position and CN's previous efforts to return Mr. Smith to his pre-injury position as a locomotive engineer constituted reasonable accommodation.\n[168] As to the potential hardship for Mr. Smith and his family in moving to Prince George, he found that the duty to accommodate does not make CN the insurer of all aspects of Mr. Smith's economic and family life. CN's obligation is limited to workplace employment accommodation.\n[169] On October 1, 2003, Mr. McDonald wrote to Mr. Smith advising him that WCB would no longer provide any vocational rehabilitation benefits. The basis for his decision was that the traffic coordinator position was particularly suited for his return to work given his condition and work restrictions. In his view, the RTWP was not successful because of the barriers which Mr. Smith had raised. Accordingly, WCB would no longer be involved in any return to work process for Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith was not entitled to any projected loss of earnings.\n[170] Mr. Smith asked the WCB Review Division for a review of Mr. McDonald's October 1, 2003 decision. The review officer confirmed his decision on July 12, 2004.\n[171] On August 9, 2004, a WCB disability awards officer wrote to Mr. Smith advising him that the traffic coordinator job was a suitable accommodation within his work restrictions.\n[172] Mr. Smith asked for a review of this decision. The review officer's decision on March 31, 2005, was that the accommodated position of traffic coordinator was suitable and available to Mr. Smith. He could earn wages comparable to his pre-injury wages. It was reasonable for him to relocate to take up this position. Mr. Smith appealed this finding to the Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal.\nJ. RTWP No. 5 - Assistant Traffic Coordinator - January 2004 [173] But the accommodation saga did not end on July 29, 2003. Shortly after the arbitrator's decision, there were discussions and correspondence between Rob Reny from CN and Dave Brummund from the Union. Mr. Brummund asked Mr. Reny if CN would reinstate the RTWP for the traffic coordinator's position in Prince George. The Union's position was that Mr. Smith was capable of doing that job.\n[174] CN agreed to do so, but this time for the position of assistant traffic coordinator. Ms. Gordon was asked to prepare a revised RTWP. It was to commence on January 12, 2004, to be completed on January 30, 2004. This position was designed specifically for Mr. Smith, taking into account his work restrictions. CN would pay his salary, his transportation costs to and from Terrace, his accommodation, transportation to and from work, and a daily per diem for expenses.\n[175] CN also agreed that following the successful completion of his training, it would give Mr. Smith an adjustable ergonomic work station and chair, install more flexible flooring in the office and renovate the yard office to accommodate this equipment.\n[176] As before, Mr. Smith was to complete daily diaries recording his completed tasks, his comfort levels and whether he encountered any difficulties.\n(i) Mr. Smith's Duties and Responsibility of Assistant Traffic Coordinator [177] Mr. Smith was to assist the traffic coordinator on duty. He would not have the primary responsibility for the position. Mr. Smith would have access to the first aid room and could leave the traffic coordinator's area when required to lie down and deal with his back symptoms.\n[178] The assistant traffic coordinator is not a safety critical position. This would give Mr. Smith much greater flexibility to stand, to lie down and to walk around.\n[179] At his request, CN transported his personal chair from Terrace to Prince George.\n[180] Mr. Smith did not complete this RTWP. It appears from his diary entries that he worked from January 12 to January 27, 2004. He said that he had a very difficult time during this trial return to work. His diary entries are detailed, but describe the medical problems he experienced without relating them to the tasks he was doing.\n[181] Although Ms. Gordon and other members of the transition team reminded Mr. Smith a number of times of the importance of the diary information, Mr. Smith acknowledged that there was little in his diaries about the tasks he was doing.\n[182] Mr. Smith agreed that as assistant traffic coordinator, he could get up, move around or leave the office to lie down because the traffic coordinator would cover off his duties. He also agreed that the assistant traffic coordinator position was less demanding than the position of traffic coordinator.\n[183] Mr. Smith agreed that during the course of the work as an assistant traffic coordinator, he was not asked to do anything that exceeded his work restrictions.\n(ii) Termination of the Assistant Traffic Coordinator RTWP [184] Mr. Radford observed that, at the beginning, Mr. Smith did quite well. But as time went on, the amount of time he spent on the job during his shifts began to decrease. Mr. Radford was concerned that this would interrupt his training cycle. There was a limited amount of time to get Mr. Smith trained and he was running behind schedule.\n[185] On January 29, 2004, Mr. Radford received a voice mail in his office from Mr. Smith asking if he could meet him as soon as possible at a restaurant in Prince George. Mr. Radford drove there and found that Mr. Smith appeared to him to be in some pain. He asked Mr. Radford if he would accompany him to his hotel. Mr. Radford did so.\n[186] Mr. Smith told Mr. Radford that he had been experiencing significant pain. At that point Mr. Radford concluded that the RTWP should be ended. The best option to assist Mr. Smith was return him to Terrace where he could be with his wife and his doctor and deal with his medical problems.\nK. Another Opportunity for the Assistant Traffic Coordinator Position [187] On February 13, 2004, following the aborted RTWP, Mr. Brummund wrote to Mr. Reny requesting that Mr. Smith be given another opportunity for the assistant traffic coordinator position. He asked that CN provide an ergonomic chair, an adjustable work station and have an occupational therapist review the work area and perhaps suggest modifications.\n[188] On June 29, 2004, Mr. Reny replied to Mr. Brummund that CN would extend to Mr. Smith one final opportunity to return to work as an assistant traffic coordinator in Prince George. But, Mr. Smith had to give CN a written commitment to see the plan through to its end and to provide detailed daily diaries.\n[189] Mr. Reny was concerned that there had been little progress with Mr. Smith's return to work. In this exchange, he wanted to make it very clear that CN was looking for Mr. Smith to actively participate and cooperate in any future return-to-work attempts. It was still not clear to CN that Mr. Smith was willing to relocate.\n[190] CN would undertake the necessary renovations and equipment purchase upon the successful completion of the RTWP. CN would also maintain the flexibility introduced in the previous return-to-work programs, allowing Mr. Smith the opportunity to alternate between sitting, standing and walking. As well, he would be able to lie down in the first aid room when necessary.\n[191] Mr. Brummund's response to Mr. Reny's letter came on August 13, 2004. The Union wanted a precise definition of the commitment, and how did CN contemplate Mr. Smith seeing the RTWP through to its end.\n[192] As to the diaries, the Union's position was that Mr. Smith had been completing the diaries as required, but CN had not made any adjustments for Mr. Smith's medical problems.\n[193] Mr. Reny wrote back on August 20, 2004. Mr. Reny confirmed that CN would make the modifications requested upon Mr. Smith's successful completion of the return-to-work program. He noted the conclusions of the WCB and CN's Occupational Health Services that these modifications were not critical to Mr. Smith's successful completion of the training. All CN was asking was that Mr. Smith work through a basic three-week program to assess his ability to function in this workplace.\n[194] Most importantly, CN offered Mr. Smith the permanent position of assistant traffic coordinator in Prince George, to take effect immediately. But Mr. Smith had to cooperate in completing the task diaries for the return to work coordinator so that any necessary modifications can be made either to his work and\/or work area. CN also offered to cover Mr. Smith's relocation costs to Prince George. Mr. Reny asked for the Union's and Mr. Smith's agreement.\n[195] Mr. Smith wrote to Mr. Brummund on September 1, 2004, responding to Mr. Reny's letter. He said that there was nothing new in this proposal. It was his view that no new remedies\/solutions\/modifications were offered by CN.\n[196] Mr. Reny emailed Mr. Brummund on October 12, 2004, pointing out that CN's intent has and continues to accommodate Mr. Smith with long term, permanent employment. Nothing has changed with CN's operations in Terrace that would accomplish this for Mr. Smith in Terrace. He asked that the Union respond to CN's August 20, 2004 proposal.\n[197] Mr. Reny emailed Mr. Brummund on January 11, 2005 asking for the Union's response. In his January 18, 2005 email to Mr. Brummund, Mr. Reny pointed out that CN had modified its offer in response to the specific requests from the Union. He asked again for the Union's position.\n[198] In emails to Mr. Shewchuck on June 14, 2005, August 15, 2005 and September 7, 2005, Mr. Reny repeated his request.\n[199] Despite these many requests by Mr. Reny asking the Union for its position to his August 20, 2004 offer, the Union has never formally replied.\nL. Mr. Smith's Application for Canada Pension Plan Disability Pension [200] On February 17, 2002, Mr. Smith applied for CPP disability benefits. The eligibility criteria require that the applicant has a disability that precludes doing any work on a regular basis, full-time, part-time or seasonal. The disability must be long term and of unknown duration.\n[201] Initially, Mr. Smith was denied CPP disability benefits. The decision of the Disability Specialist on April 12, 2002, was that his file information including medical reports indicated that although he could not work at jobs that required prolonged sitting or standing, he was still able to do some type of work.\n[202] Mr. Smith asked for a reconsideration of this decision. His request for reconsideration was denied on August 29, 2002, because he failed to satisfy the disability criteria.\n[203] Mr. Smith then appealed to the CPP Review Tribunal which heard his appeal on March 10, 2004. At that hearing, Mr. Smith took the position that he was incapable of doing any work as of February 2002. He made oral representations to the Tribunal to this effect, as did his wife.\n[204] Mr. Smith also submitted a letter from Dr. Appleton dated March 3, 2004. In his letter, after summarizing Mr. Smith's medical condition and work restrictions, Dr. Appleton stated that he considered Mr. Smith to be completely disabled from any form of meaningful employment.\n[205] The impetus for this letter came from Mr. Smith. In his clinical notes for March 3, 2004, Dr. Appleton noted that he met with Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith told him that he was appealing a negative CPP disability pension decision. The hearing was scheduled for March 10 and he needed a letter of support.\n[206] This opinion of Dr. Appleton should be contrasted to his opinion as expressed in his March 28, 2002 letter. There Dr. Appleton wrote To Whom It May Concern. He described Mr. Smith's medical condition, his back surgery and his work restrictions. Dr. Appleton then went on to say that even with these restrictions, Mr. Smith would have been able to return to the work force as of June 10, 2001. This letter was written by Dr. Appleton in connection with Mr. Smith's employment insurance application.\n[207] The Review Tribunal issued its decision on April 28, 2004. It concluded that Mr. Smith's disabilities rendered him incapable of doing any regular gainful employment from February 2002 when he first applied for a CPP disability pension. He was awarded a disability pension retroactive to June 2002.\n[208] Mr. Smith agreed in his application for the CPP disability pension to notify CPP of any changes in his medical condition; or a return to work (full, part-time, volunteer or trial period or any rehabilitation). He did not do so.\n[209] Mr. Smith did not advise CPP of his two RTWP's in June 2003 and January 2004 for which he was paid a full salary. He did not advise CPP of his November 2002 functional capacity evaluation, setting out his physical ability and functional capacity to work.\n[210] Mr. Smith did not tell CN, his Union or WCB that he had applied for a CPP disability pension in February 2002. He did not tell them about Dr. Appleton's March 4, 2004 letter advising that he was disabled and could not do any meaningful work.\n[211] Mr. Smith did not disclose in his CPP application or at the CPP Review Tribunal or later that he was one of the founding members of the Northwest Injured Workers Association (NIWA) which was incorporated on February 2, 2002. One of the main purposes of this organization was to provide advice and support for injured workers involved in the WCB process.\n[212] Mr. Smith is very much involved as a volunteer with the NIWA. He was instrumental in its incorporation. He has organized and has spoken at a number of rallies and meetings in Terrace and at other locations in the area. He was significantly involved in seeking financial support for NIWA to fund its activities and paid positions. If his funding efforts were successful, Mr. Smith hoped to occupy one of the paid positions.\n[213] Mr. Smith applied in the fall of 2002 or 2003 for the position of Workers' Advisor to the Minister of Labor. This would involve assisting WCB claimants by guiding them through the WCB process.\nM. Can Mr. Smith Work or is He Permanently Disabled? - Facts to Consider (i) September 21, 2004 letter [214] In September 2004, Dr. Appleton wrote a letter, To Whom It May Concern. In his letter, Dr. Appleton gave his opinion regarding CN's latest offer as set out in Mr. Reny's August 20, 2004 letter. Dr. Appleton opined that this work situation was no different from the previous assistant traffic coordinator training that Mr. Smith tried earlier.\n[215] Mr. Smith agreed that Dr. Appleton's understanding of the assistant traffic coordinator in Prince George was based on what he had told him. He said that he requested this letter from Dr. Appleton and wanted Dr. Appleton's opinion as to whether he could perform the duties of an assistant traffic coordinator. It is not clear why Mr. Smith wanted this. He already had Dr. Appleton's March 3, 2004 opinion which he submitted to the CPP Review Tribunal that he was incapable of working at all.\n(ii) Application for Judicial Review of the Arbitrator's Decision [216] The Union filed a judicial review application of the arbitrator's decision which it later abandoned. The Union's counsel, Clayton Cook, had discussed this with Mr. Smith and told him that there was little or no chance of success.\n[217] In a lengthy fax to Mr. Cook on June 20, 2004, Mr. Smith disputed this conclusion. After summarizing in detail the facts of his case, Mr. Smith reiterated his position which was put forward by the Union at the arbitration, that CN has a duty to accommodate him at his home terminal before alternative accommodation is even considered. He disagreed with the arbitrator's decision that the CN had made reasonable efforts to do this.\n[218] Mr. Smith wanted to proceed to the judicial review. The implication is that he was capable of working at that time, certainly in Terrace. But, in his discussions with and fax to Mr. Cook, he never told him that he is receiving a CPP disability pension.\n(iii) The WCAT Decision - February 2006 [219] As indicated earlier, Mr. Smith appealed to the Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) a number of WCB decisions, including the March 31, 2005 decision of the review officer denying Mr. Smith a permanent disability award. The appeal was heard on November 29, 2005. Mr. Smith was represented by counsel.\n[220] In its February 10, 2006 decision, WCAT confirmed the review officer's decision that Mr. Smith was not entitled to a permanent disability award based on projected loss of earnings. In coming to this conclusion, WCAT concluded:\nthat the medical evidence indicates that the ideal job for Mr. Smith would allow him to sit, stand and walk around as required;\nthat the assistant traffic coordinator position meets his work restrictions and provides Mr. Smith with the ideal job opportunity and the maximum flexibility to deal with his back spasms should they occur;\nthat Mr. Smith is fit to undertake the assistant traffic coordinator job;\nrejected Mr. Smith's argument that WCB and CN is obliged to look for any job that Mr. Smith could do in Terrace before looking elsewhere. If CN could provide a suitable job elsewhere it makes no sense to find a job paying a minimum wage in Terrace and pay a permanent disability award for wage loss;\nthat Mr. Smith does not have deep roots in Terrace noting that he had lived there for 16 years but had previously lived in Prince George for eight years. His wife is employed part-time and works below her qualifications as a pharmacist. His children have left the home. On the whole, Mr. Smith's ties to Terrace are not strong and his preference for Terrace does not entitle him to a permanent disability award;\nthat CN acted in good faith in offering the two training opportunities in Prince George to Mr. Smith and then offering the permanent position to him; Mr. Smith did not act in good faith by not taking advantage of this offer;\nthat his difficulties in the training were in large part of his own making. The extent of his back spasms, the degree to which they are caused by certain activities, the degree of disability caused by them and the necessity to lie down to treat them are known only by Mr. Smith's reports. They are not independently verifiable.\nthat Mr. Smith has declined a job which was suitable, available and which would match his pre-injury job rate.\n(iv) Dr. Appleton's 2006 Clinical Notes [221] On February 7, 2006, Mr. Smith met with Dr. Appleton. In his clinical notes, Dr. Appleton wrote that Mr. Smith is going to arbitration with the Human Rights Commission with regard to his back pain and CN's inability to provide him with alternate employment. It was Dr. Appleton's understanding that CN had offered Mr. Smith alternate employment which may have suited him, out of Terrace, but Mr. Smith refused to go.\n[222] After describing Mr. Smith's symptoms and his current activities, Dr. Appleton went on to write that Mr. Smith has a history of lumbar disc problems and his ongoing problem might be expected with prolonged sitting and standing. But his picture of back spasms, however, is not compatible with the above. It was Dr. Appleton's strong feeling that there is a very large emotional component here, although he does not think that Mr. Smith is malingering.\n[223] Dr. Appleton concluded that he told Mr. Smith in no uncertain terms that he does not find any physiological reasons to his overall spasming and that he would not be able to substantiate a physical reason for this if asked.\n[224] Mr. Smith met again with Dr. Appleton on May 24, 2006, a few days before the commencement of the Tribunal hearing into his complaint. In his clinical notes, Dr. Appleton wrote that Mr. Smith had concerns about Dr. Appleton's comments in his February 7, 2006 notes that Mr. Smith had been offered alternate employment out of Terrace but he had refused.\n[225] Dr. Appleton corrected this by noting that his comment related to an earlier consultation during which he and Mr. Smith discussed the possibility of work outside the area, compatible with his injuries. At that time Mr. Smith told him it would be difficult to move because of his wife's job. Dr. Appleton concluded that he was not aware of any job offered by CN that would be suitable for Mr. Smith, given his injuries.\n(v) Referral to Dr. Keyes, Neurologist [226] Mr. Smith asked Dr. Appleton to refer him to another specialist about his lower back spasms. Mr. Smith had come up with the name of Dr. Keyes, a neurologist. Although Dr. Appleton did not think that Dr. Keyes would have much to offer, he did make the referral.\n[227] Mr. Smith was assessed by Dr. Keyes on November 1, 2006. After his consultation with Dr. Keyes, Mr. Smith wrote him and indicated that the last time he tried to return to work, his employer offered him a computer job which involved sitting or standing at a work station. He had difficulties with this because of pain and muscle spasms.\n[228] For the most of his November 9, 2006 report, Dr. Keyes provided a detailed, technical medical diagnosis for Mr. Smith. He concluded that Mr. Smith has significant disc space narrowing which will be the cause of his low back pain. He did not recommend any further surgery, but did recommend that Mr. Smith's spasms and pain be treated with medication and ongoing physiotherapy.\n(vi) Mr. Smith's Application for CN Disability Retirement Benefits [229] On May 18, 2006, Mr. Smith applied for CN disability retirement benefits. To be eligible, an employee must be totally and permanently disabled. Totally and permanently disabled means a physical or a mental impairment that prevents an individual from engaging in any employment for which he\/she is reasonably suited by virtue of his\/her education, training or experience and that can reasonably be expected to last for the remainder of his\/her lifetime. This was the first time Mr. Smith represented to CN that he was totally and permanently disabled.\n[230] In his completed and signed application, Mr. Smith acknowledged that he was receiving CPP pension benefits. He also acknowledged that there is no basis or opportunity to accommodate him and his disability. He released CN from any obligation to accommodate him that it may otherwise have had.\n[231] Dr. Appleton completed the attending physician portion of Mr. Smith's application. He wrote that Mr. Smith had lumbar disc prolapse and experienced mechanical low back pain, which was ongoing for years. Dr. Appleton reported Mr. Smith's WCB work restrictions as, limited sitting, bending, no lifting and frequent changes in position.\n[232] As to whether Mr. Smith was totally and permanently disabled as per the eligibility criteria, Dr. Appleton wrote that there is no occupation available to fit these restrictions.\n[233] Mr. Smith's application was not accepted by CN. Dr. Lapierre, CN's Chief Medical Officer, wrote to Mr. Smith on June 13, 2006 advising him that he did not meet the eligibility criteria. According to the available medical information, there was no indication that his medical restrictions would prevent him from working.\n[234] In reaching this conclusion, Dr. Lapierre reviewed medical information in Mr. Smith's file in CN's Occupational Health Services department and the CPP Review Tribunal's decision. Dr. Lapierre took into account the February 10, 2006 WCAT decision, in particular, the findings of WCAT that the assistant traffic coordinator job is suitable and available for Mr. Smith, is within his work restrictions and the wages for that job would match his pre-injury wage rate.\n[235] He also considered the August 20, 2004 job offer by CN to Mr. Smith. This offer was relevant to assess fitness for duty by comparing Mr. Smith's work restrictions with the requirements of the job.\n[236] On the basis of this information Dr. Lapierre concluded that Mr. Smith is not totally disabled and thus did not meet the criteria for a CN disability pension.\n[237] Dr. Lapierre said that the decision of the CPP Review Tribunal was not of much value in reaching his decision. There was no medical information in the decision that he could rely on.\n[238] Dr. Lapierre did not have discussions with CN officials regarding Mr. Smith's human rights complaint. It did not figure at all in his decision to reject Mr. Smith's disability pension application.\n(vii) Mr. Smith's June 29, 2006 Email Enquiry for Work with CN [239] On June 29, 2006, Mr. Smith sent an email to David Trites, CN's Return to Work Coordinator who had replaced Tanya Gordon. This was 10 days after the commencement of the Tribunal hearing on June 19, 2006. In his email, Mr. Smith indicated that he was pleased to have heard that Mr. Trites and Lynn Chorley, (CN's Occupational Health Team Leader) were both interested in finding him some work within his capabilities, as the assistant yard coordinator position has been unsuitable. Any positions or ideas they might have, he would be very interested in. He asked that Mr. Trites or the Terrace manager let him know of any ideas they come up with.\n(viii) Mr. Smith's Proposed Accommodation - September 2006 [240] When concluding his evidence in chief in September 2006, Mr. Smith was asked what he would consider to be acceptable employment at this point in time. He proposed that CN offer him the assistant traffic coordinator position in Terrace. As to what accommodations he would require to do this job in Terrace, Mr. Smith asked for the following:\na suitable chair;\na height adjustable work station;\nsomewhere where he could lie down and with access to an electrical outlet for his heating pad;\nfatigue matting on the floor;\nflexibility to leave his work station to walk or lie down as required.\n[241] CN's August 20, 2004 offer, which remains open for acceptance, provides that upon completion of his training, CN will renovate the traffic coordinator's office, install a padded floor, and provide a suitable ergonomic chair and adjustable work station.\n[242] Mr. Smith would also be provided with a place to lie down and he would have the flexibility to leave his work station when required. He could do this because assistant traffic coordinator was not a safety critical position and he did not have primary responsibilities of the traffic coordinator.\n[243] The only difference between what CN has offered and what Mr. Smith has proposed is that one position is in Prince George and the other is in Terrace. Mr. Smith did not give any explanation as to why he thought he could do the assistant traffic coordinator in Terrace, but not in Prince George.\n(ix) Mr. Smith's Human Rights Complaint and the Remedies He Requested [244] In his February 28, 2002 complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Mr. Smith alleges that CN had discriminated against him on the grounds of disability by not accommodating his disability and by not offering him alternative employment.\n[245] In paragraph 49 of his amended Statement of Particulars dated June 6, 2006, Mr. Smith asks for an order that the CN provide him with suitable accommodation in the Terrace area, either by enabling him to perform the traffic coordinator's or assistant traffic coordinator's position or by offering him alternate suitable employment.\n[246] In paragraph 52A of his Statement of Particulars, Mr. Smith requests an order that CN approve his disability application and make up the pension deficiency which arose because he was unable to work and because CN failed to offer him suitable employment.\n[247] At the conclusion of his evidence in September 2006, Mr. Smith was asked by the Tribunal about the inconsistency between his request to be accommodated in Terrace with suitable employment, when at the same time, he is seeking a CN disability pension on the basis that he be totally and permanently disabled from any suitable employment.\n[248] Mr. Smith's response as expressed in his counsel's February 19, 2007 letter to the Tribunal is that he no longer seeks the remedy in paragraph 49 that CN provide him with suitable accommodation in Terrace.\n[249] Mr. Smith explained, through his counsel, that\n. . . due in part to the outcome of the referral . . . to Dr. Keyes, his answer to the question is that he doesn't wish to pursue the relief as, he no longer believes he will recover enough to be able to work on a regular basis.\nSo, what this means is that Mr. Smith is conceding now, with the hindsight of 2007, that he has not been able to work throughout the period, pretty well the entire period that is covered by this complaint. . . . He is not conceding that he was . . . he did not believe that, he did not accept that until he was driven to that conclusion very recently. That was not his view back in 2001 or 2002. He still hoped at that time he would be able to work and, of course, there's lot of evidence that he tried.\nV. REASONS FOR DECISION A. Did CN Discriminate\/Retaliate Against Mr. Smith by Rejecting his Application for a CN Disability Retirement Pension? [250] To succeed, Mr. Smith must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. To do so, Mr. Smith must show that he met the eligibility criteria for the disability pension and it was refused.\n[251] For a prima facie case of retaliation, he must show that his application was rejected because he filed his complaint with the CHRC.\n[252] Dealing first with Mr. Smith's discrimination allegation, Mr. Smith's position is that he has come to the conclusion that, with the hindsight of 2007, he is not able to work on a regular basis. His reasons are based in part on his referral to Dr. Keyes.\n[253] The decision as to whether Mr. Smith is totally and permanently disabled from engaging any employment must be based on objective medical evidence. The only medical evidence on this question is Dr. Appleton's March 3, 2004 letter To Whom It May Concern stating that he considered Mr. Smith completely disabled from any meaningful work.\n[254] But the weight to be given to this opinion must be significantly discounted. There are a number of reasons for this. First, it was written at Mr. Smith's request. He told Dr. Appleton about his upcoming CPP appeal and that he needed Dr. Appleton's support.\n[255] Second, Dr. Appleton, in his earlier March 28, 2002 letter, in support of Mr. Smith's employment insurance application indicated that Mr. Smith could return to work on June 10, 2001.\n[256] Third, Dr. Appleton, the medical practitioner most intimately familiar with Mr. Smith's medical condition was never called to testify in this hearing. This is so even though the first week of the hearing was held in Terrace where Dr. Appleton resides. The remaining weeks of the hearing were in Vancouver. Mr. Smith's counsel indicated to the Tribunal that Dr. Appleton would be in Vancouver during one of those weeks.\n[257] No explanation was given by Mr. Smith as to why Dr. Appleton did not give evidence before the Tribunal.\n[258] Fourth, Dr. Appleton's clinical notes and his WCB attending physician reports were entered as exhibits on behalf of Dr. Appleton at the hearing. But in the absence of Dr. Appleton, CN was not able, through cross-examination, to test the validity of his medical opinion regarding Mr. Smith. For the same reason, Dr. Appleton's assessment that he provided in Mr. Smith's CN disability application must receive the same fate.\n[259] Fifth, there are examples in the evidence which demonstrate that Dr. Appleton acted as an advocate for Mr. Smith. These include his March 28, 2002 and his March 3, 2004 letters, both of which he wrote at the instance of Mr. Smith.\n[260] There is also his intervention on behalf of Mr. Smith with Mr. Beddie in calling for a face to face meeting with Dr. Appleton, Mr. Smith, CN and WCB officials to seek a resolution of Mr. Smith's work situation.\n[261] Finally, the fact that none of the specialists who assessed Mr. Smith, including Dr. Wing, Dr. Clarke or Dr. Keyes offered the medical opinion that Mr. Smith was totally and permanently disabled from engaging in any employment.\n[262] But, it is not just the absence of objective medical evidence. Mr. Smith's own actions over the years 2002 to 2004 belie the conclusion that he was incapable of working.\n[263] At the same time that Mr. Smith was receiving a CPP disability pension from June 2002, Mr. Smith:\ncaused his Union to pursue to arbitration on July 9, 2003, his grievance that CN should provide him with suitable employment in Terrace;\nin July 2004, discussed with Union counsel and reiterated by fax to Union counsel that the judicial review application of the arbitration should proceed and that CN had a duty to accommodate him with employment at Terrace;\npursued his WCAT appeal in November 2000, in which he took the position that WCB is obliged to find work for Mr. Smith in Terrace before looking elsewhere;\nproposed at the hearing before the Tribunal in September 2006, that an acceptable accommodation would be for CN to offer him the assistant traffic coordinator position in Terrace;\nin his statement of Particulars dated June 2006, asked by way of remedy that he be accommodated in Terrace with the traffic coordinator or assistant traffic coordinator position or other alternate, suitable employment. Mr. Smith only resiled from this in February 2007 when faced with the inconsistency between this remedy request and his request that CN be ordered to approve his application for a CN disability pension;\nin his June 29, 2006 email to David Trite, CN's Return to Work Coordinator, advised him that he would be interested in any work within his capabilities that he or the Terrace manager might come up with;\nMr. Smith never advised CPP, as he agreed to do in his CPP application, of his trial training in July 2003 and January 2004 or of his volunteer work with NIWA;\ndid not tell CN, the Union counsel, or the arbitrator that he was receiving a disability pension on the basis that he was incapable of working.\n[264] Clearly Mr. Smith believed he was capable of working, be it traffic coordinator, assistant traffic coordinator or any other suitable employment in Terrace.\n[265] I have concluded, in the absence of any credible, objective medical evidence and on the basis of Mr. Smith's actions and the position he has taken, that Mr. Smith is not totally and permanently disabled from engaging in any employment.\n[266] As to Mr. Smith's allegation that CN retaliated against him by filing his complaint with the CHRC, I accept the evidence of Dr. Lapierre that he made his decision based on objective considerations and he did not take into account Mr. Smith's human rights complaint.\nB. Did CN Accommodate Mr. Smith? [267] Mr. Smith argues that he suffered from a disability, could not return to his pre-injury job, and CN did offer a suitable work alternative. Accepting that Mr. Smith has established a prima facie case, the question is whether CN accommodated his disability.\n[268] There are two legal principles coming out of the Supreme Court of Canada in Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] S.C.R. 970, that are relevant here. First, the Court said that the obligation to accommodate is limited by the words reasonable and short of undue hardship. These limiting factors are alternative ways of expressing the same concept. What amounts to reasonable measures will vary with the facts of each case.\n[269] The second principle from Renaud is that when seeking accommodation, the employee must accept a reasonable accommodation even though it might not be the preferred accommodation. If an employee refuses an offer for an accommodation that is reasonable in the circumstances, then the employer's duty is discharged.\n[270] Consider now the circumstances in this case. At the request of the WCB, CN developed RTWP No. 1 to commence in December 2000. It was a graduated RTWP which took into account the job duties for locomotive engineer, his WCB work limitations, the 1999 WorkAble report and discussions with Mr. Smith about his tolerances and current activities.\n[271] The plan was also reviewed and approved by Dr. Appleton, Dr. Wing, and by Dr. Faraday who had confirmed Mr. Smith's work restrictions. Mr. Smith did not complete this RTWP.\n[272] Following up on an earlier suggestion from Mr. Smith, CN developed RTWP No. 2 to start in March 2001. This was a graduated RTWP involving lighter duties and local yard work which would avoid prolonged sitting in the locomotive engine. Both Dr. Coppin and Dr. Appleton considered this to be a reasonable plan. Mr. Smith did not complete this RTWP.\n[273] RTWP No.3 was initiated by Mr. Wiederspiel from the Union, who had asked CN to reactivate the previous plan. CN agreed and modified the plan as per the Union's suggestions.\n[274] Mr. Smith also reviewed the plan and suggested further modifications to Ms. Dawson. At no point did he tell Ms. Dawson that he objected to participating in this modified plan.\n[275] It is clear that the goal of WCB and CN was to return Mr. Smith to his pre-injury job. Certainly Mr. Smith had doubts as to whether he could do so. Certainly Dr. Appleton had recommended that Mr. Smith avoid prolonged sitting, as had Drs. McDougall, Faraday and Wing.\n[276] On the basis that the RTWPs were drafted and prescribed a graduated return-to-work program to deal specifically with this concern; that RTWP No.1 and 2 were approved not only by the WCB, but also by Mr. Smith's medical advisors and CN's advisors; and that RTWP No.3 was at the behest of Mr. Smith's Union, I have concluded that these three RTWPs constituted reasonable accommodation within the Renaud principle.\n[277] Over the period from April 2001 to March 2003, the operational people in Terrace and Mr. Smith's return to work team were canvassed about other potential jobs for him in Terrace. Mr. Smith had also offered suggestions to CN to personnel officers in Edmonton.\n[278] The evidence is that were no opportunities in Terrace that could accommodate Mr. Smith except creating a position not otherwise required. Mr. Smith's suggestions would not produce long term, gainful employment.\n[279] In May 2003, CN, in conjunction with WCB and with the support of the Union, proposed RTWP No.4 to accommodate Mr. Smith in a traffic coordinator position in Prince George. His training took place on June\/July 2003. Once again, Mr Smith did not complete the training and the plan was terminated.\n[280] In January 2004, CN offered to Mr. Smith RTWP No. 5, the position of assistant traffic coordinator in Prince George. This offer was to take effect immediately. Mr. Smith had only to complete the training program. He did not take up this offer. It remains outstanding.\n[281] The evidence is definitive that the assistant traffic coordinator position is the ideal job for Mr. Smith, given his work restrictions. It allows him to sit, stand and walk around as required. He can leave his work area to go to a designated room to lie down. The job is not safety critical.\n[282] That this is the ideal job for Mr. Smith was also the opinion of the WCB Review Board in its March 14, 2003 decision. And was the opinion of WCAT in its February 10, 2006 decision. The traffic coordinator position was considered by Arbitrator Pich\u00e9 to be a reasonable accommodation of Mr. Smith's disability under the CHRA.\n[283] Mr. Smith's evidence was that his back spasms which he experienced in his training, prevented him from doing the traffic coordinator job. But this is what Mr. Smith reported to Dr. Appleton, in his diaries and at the Tribunal hearing. This evidence is not objectively or independently verifiable as was pointed out by WCAT. As noted earlier, Mr. Smith had the opportunity to call Dr. Appleton or any other doctor who had assessed him. He chose not to do so.\n[284] In his February 7, 2006 clinical notes, Dr. Appleton wrote that it was his feeling that there was a large emotional component with Mr. Smith's back spasms and he could not find any physiological reason for his overall spasming.\n[285] On this question, I agree with the WCAT finding that the difficulties experienced by Mr. Smith during his training for traffic coordinator were, in large part, of his own making.\n[286] Also to be considered is Mr. Smith's continuing insistence before WCAT and before this Tribunal, that he be accommodated as a traffic coordinator in Terrace. If he could do this job in Terrace, he could do it in Prince George. I can only conclude that Mr. Smith was not willing to relocate from Terrace to Prince George.\n[287] Mr. Smith's Renaud obligation is to accept a reasonable accommodation. He can not expect the perfect solution. CN's offer for the traffic\/assistant traffic coordinator position is a reasonable accommodation in all the circumstances. Mr. Smith has not met his Renaud duty. CN's duty to accommodate him is discharged.\n[288] Mr. Smith has also asserted that CN has discriminated against him on the grounds of family status. His argument is that relocating to Prince George would negatively impact on Mrs. Smith. She would have to give up her job as assistant librarian in Terrace.\n[289] Family status is not a ground in Mr. Smith's complaint. In his closing submissions, he did not present any jurisprudence as to whether these facts amounted to family status discrimination.\n[290] Further, I agree with Arbitrator Pich\u00e9's opinion that the duty to accommodate under the CHRA does not make an employer the insurer of all of the employee's economic and family life.\nVI. CONCLUSION [291] CN did accommodate Mr. Smith's disability. CN did not discriminate or retaliate against Mr. Smith in its dealings with WCB. CN did not discriminate or retaliate against Mr. Smith in rejecting his application for a CN disability retirement pension.\n[292] Mr. Smith's complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ.

Hadjis Date: May 16, 2008 Citation: 2008 CHRT 16\n[1] A number of parties filed letters with the Tribunal over the last two weeks regarding the redacted portions of certain documents that the Commission had disclosed. In order to gain a better understanding of the matters at issue, on May 12, 2008, the Tribunal asked the Respondent to provide me with a digital copy of the documents in question, in redacted form. Ms. Kulaszka kindly so obliged on May 13, 2008.\n[2] I have now had the opportunity to view the said documents. They were apparently parcelled into eight groupings, and consist of the following:\n- Two briefs prepared by the London Ontario Police Service for the Crown Prosecutor\u2019s office dated respectively September 28, 2001, and February 1, 2002. They relate to an investigation of James Scott Richardson, who was a respondent in the Tribunal case of Warman v. Kulbashian et al, 2006 CHRT 11, in respect of which the decision was rendered on March 10, 2006. Most of the redacted information appears to consist of the names and contact information of police investigators, witnesses and other individuals. - Emails sent on an MSN Hotmail account. They all appear to relate to the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (CECT) which was another respondent in the above mentioned case of Warman v. Kulbashian et al. The redactions appear to consist of names and contact information.\nAn email from Dean Steacy regarding the same case, addressed to a Det. [detective, I presume], whose name has been redacted.\n- Copy of a search warrant that again relates to the CECT. The name of the Applicant and the address where the warrant is to be executed are redacted.\nA memo to file by Dean Steacy regarding his conversation with a constable about Alexan Kulbashian and the CECT. The name and email address of the constable were redacted. A London Police Service mugshot of Mr. Richardson. The image of his face as well as his date of birth, his height and weight are redacted.\n- An excerpt from what appears to be the Commission\u2019s Investigation Report regarding the above mentioned case of Warman v. Kulbashian et al. The name(s) of one or more police officers involved in the case have been redacted. - An email to Mr. Steacy from someone at the London Police Service, whose name has been redacted, regarding the above mentioned complaint against Mr. Kulbashian et al.\nTwo briefs by the London Police Service to the Crown Prosecutor\u2019s office regarding Mr. Richardson dated respectively February 1, 2002, and February 14, 2002. The names of and aliases used by the police investigators have been redacted. The names and contact information of persons interviewed for the investigation also appear to be redacted. An unredacted version and a redacted version of a single Charge Sheet regarding the criminal charges that were filed against Mr. Richardson.\n- An email between Harvey Goldberg and someone at B\u2019Nai Brith, whose name and contact information have been redacted.\nCorrespondence between the former CHRC Chief Commissioner Maxwell Yalden\u2019s office and the Toronto Mayor\u2019s Committee on Community and Race Relations. The name of the person with whom the Chief Commissioner is corresponding has been redacted as well as the name of someone from the Simon Wiesenthal Center who is referenced therein. Correspondence by Mr. Steacy with a Corporal at the BC Hate Crime Unit, whose name and contact information have been redacted. Memos to file by Mr. Steacy regarding conversations he had with a Constable and a Corporal at the BC Hate Crime Unit, whose names and contact information have been redacted. The memos are regarding BCWhitePride, which was a respondent in a human rights complaint that was referred to the Tribunal (C.R.A.R.R. v. www.bcwhitepride.com, Tribunal file no. T1120\/0206). A memo to file by Mr. Steacy regarding communications he had with the National Security Office of an organization whose name has been redacted. The names and contact information of the individuals contacted have also been redacted. Email correspondence and related memo to file between Mr. Steacy and a police officer in London, Ontario, whose name and contact information have been redacted. The topic of the correspondence is the Complaint about the CECT. Memo to file by Mr. Steacy regarding conversations with someone at the Edmonton Police Hate Crimes Division, whose name and contact information have been redacted. The memorandum relates to Peter Kouba, who was the respondent in a human rights complaint that was referred to the Tribunal (Warman v. Kouba, Tribunal file no. T1070\/5205). Mr. Kouba\u2019s contact information was also redacted. Memo to file by Mr. Steacy regarding conversations he had with a Corporal of the Montreal Police Anti-gang Unit, and an investigator at the RCMP\u2019s National Security Office. The names and contact information of the police officers have been redacted. The conversations relate to a human rights complaint. The name of the respondent was not redacted. Email between Mr. Steacy and someone with an e-mail address ending as police.london.ca. The name of the corresponding party has been redacted as was Mr. Steacy\u2019s contact information. Memo to file by Mr. Steacy regarding a conversation he had with a Witness whose name has been redacted, regarding a human rights complaint. The names of the complainant and the respondent were not redacted. Memo to file by Mr. Steacy regarding a conversation he had with a Constable, whose name had been redacted, regarding the above mentioned complaint against the CECT. Memo to file from someone at the Commission, whose name has been redacted, to a Corporal at the RCMP Vancouver Detachment, Hate Crime Unit, whose name is also redacted. The conversation relates to the complaint filed against www.bcwhitepride.com. Memo to file by Mr. Steacy regarding a Detective whose name and contact information have been redacted. The memorandum relates to a complaint filed by a complainant, whose name and contact information have been redacted, against a respondent, whose name was not redacted. An address of a person referred to in the memo has also been redacted.\n- A series of email exchanges between Mr. Goldberg and someone who appears to work for the Winnipeg Police Service. The person\u2019s name and contact information have been redacted, as well as what appear to be numerous lines of text. It is difficult for me to surmise what these redactions are from the remaining material.\nAn email received by Mr. Steacy, Mr. Goldberg, and others (whose names have been redacted) from someone whose name has also been redacted. Numerous lines (possibly containing contact information) at the bottom of the email have also been redacted.\nIn my viewing of the documents in grouping eight, I did not see any redactions.\n[3] Thus, it appears to me that most of the redactions relate to the names of individuals and their contact information. I am hereby instructing the Commission to provide me by May 20, 2008, the unredacted copies of the documents to verify these determinations.\n[4] Rule 6(d) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure requires parties to disclose documents that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule, i.e. that are arguably relevant. The obvious question that emerges, therefore, is the following: how are the names, email addresses, phone numbers, weight and height, etc. of the individuals referred to in these documents, arguably relevant to the proportionality test set out in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, that was the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s disclosure order in the first place (see Warman v. Lemire, 2006 CHRT 32 at paras. 32 and following)?\n[5] After I review the unredacted version of the documents, I will advise the parties whether the nature of the redacted information differs from my earlier descriptions and in what way. Those parties who seek the disclosure of the redacted portions will then be invited to provide me with their submissions as to the arguable relevance of the information. If I am satisfied that any of the redacted material is arguably relevant, the Commission will be required to make its submissions regarding any privilege that it may be claiming prevents the materials\u2019 disclosure (Rule 6(e)).\n[6] On another matter, CAFE had filed letters dated May 6 and May 8, 2008, in which the following requests were made:\nOne of the requests related to the redacted disclosure of the above mentioned documents. It was my intention to deal with this request by first reviewing the redacted documents at issue, which I have now done with this ruling. Another request related to the hearing schedule, which I addressed in the May 12, 2008 ruling but which now forms the object of a new motion by the Respondent, on which submissions are being awaited from the other parties. CAFE also sought to obtain an order that the Commission disclose complete versions of documents that were originally provided by the Commission in January 2007, some portions of which had been redacted based on a privilege claim pursuant to s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act. As I have already stated in my earlier ruling in this case, Warman v. Lemire, 2007 CHRT 21 at para. 7, in hearings before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, objections to disclosure pursuant to s. 37 may only be determined by application to the Federal Court. CAFE contends that the Commission has withdrawn its s. 37 objections. However, I note that no such withdrawal is identified in the Federal Court\u2019s ruling of January 15, 2008, Docket no. T-860-07, with the exception of the Commission\u2019s objection to the issuance of a subpoena regarding Bell Canada. In any event, the matter before the Federal Court did not relate to the documentary disclosure that had occurred one year earlier, in January 2007. I am therefore not ordering the complete disclosure of documents in which s. 37 was claimed by the Commission. Finally, CAFE also requested that all documents related to a number of listed email user accounts be disclosed by the Commission, stating that they are highly relevant to the issues raised by Mr. Lemire in his constitutional motion. No further explanation is provided to explain what this relevance may be. In these circumstances, I am not ordering their disclosure.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[1] The Canadian Constitution Foundation (CCF) has requested that the Tribunal issue an order, pursuant to Rule 8 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, granting it intervener status in the present case.\n[2] The CCF stated that it intends to advance a number of arguments demonstrating that any limitations placed on freedom of expression by s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act infringe upon constitutional rights, and that due to the flaws in the provision's application and composition, the infringement cannot be justified under s. 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Similar positions have been advanced by the Respondent as well as by two of the groups that were granted intervener status in February 2006, the Canadian Association for Free Expression and the Canadian Free Speech League.\n[3] The CCF indicates in its motion that it is a citizen-based organization with supporters across Canada. It is a non-profit corporation and a registered charitable organization. Its objects include the promotion of human and civil rights through the sponsoring of selective litigation with the goal of securing enforcement of the Constitution of Canada and the Charter set out therein.\n[4] The CCF's request comes extremely late in this hearing's process and the CCF has not provided a satisfactory explanation for the lateness of its request. The complaint was referred to the Tribunal on August 24, 2005. By February 2006, five groups had applied to the Tribunal seeking leave to appear as interested parties at the inquiry. The Tribunal, by ruling dated February 23, 2006, granted all of them permission to participate (Warman v. Lemire, 2006 CHRT 8). The groups were granted intervener party status but solely with respect to the constitutionality of s. 13 and any related provisions thereof. In addition, given the constitutional issue raised by the Respondent, the Attorney General exercised its rights, pursuant to s. 57 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, to participate and adduce evidence at the hearing, and make submissions in respect of the constitutional question.\n[5] The hearing of evidence in this case began on January 31, 2007, and most of the testimonial evidence was adduced over a total of four weeks, ending on March 1, 2007. Three additional witnesses were heard over a total of five days in May-June 2007 and one day in March 2008.\n[6] The Tribunal has wide discretion with respect to the granting of interested party status (Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service), [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 15 at para. 22 (Q.L.)). The administration of this case has been to say the least, unwieldy and challenging. Each of the parties is represented by legal counsel or agent. Dates for final oral submissions, to be made over the course of three days, have been set and a tiered schedule for the exchange of written arguments between the parties has been established. Most of the evidence adduced during the hearing has related exclusively to the constitutional issue. A party seeking to now join the case and to make submissions will not have had the benefit of viewing that evidence first hand, which could potentially limit the relevance and accuracy of its submissions.\n[7] The addition of a tenth party to this hearing will further weigh down and complicate these proceedings, which the Tribunal is, after all, mandated by s. 48.9 (1) of the Act, to conduct as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and rules of procedure allow. In particular, permitting the CCF to participate may require additional submissions to be made by all other participants who are adverse in interest.\n[8] Furthermore, as the Tribunal in Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc. [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 14 at para. 6 (CHRT) (QL) noted, interested party status will not be granted if it does not add significantly to the legal positions of the parties representing a similar viewpoint. As I have already indicated, the CCF's conclusions with regard to s. 13 of the Act reflect those of at least three of the parties already participating in this case. If the CCF has any specific arguments that if feels may be relevant to the constitutional issue, nothing prevents it from sharing them with the Respondent and any of the existing interveners so that they may be put before the Tribunal by these participants' more than able counsel and agents.\n[9] Finally, while I note that none of the participants has objected to the proposed intervention of the CCF, I believe that the absence of an objection is not determinative to the disposition of a motion that will impact on the efficient management of the hearing.\n[10] For these reasons, the CCF's request is denied.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[1] The Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (the Department), has made a motion requesting that the Tribunal exercise its discretion to refuse to hear the Complainant's current complaint on the basis that the same matter has already been disposed of and conclusively determined by the parties in 2003, when they signed a negotiated settlement in a case that involved the same parties and raised identical issues (Tribunal Number T683\/7101).\nBackground\n[2] In 1999, the Complainant filed human rights complaints against the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake (MCK) and the Department (then known as the Department of Indian and Northern Development). She alleged that the MCK refused to accept her as a Band member based on her family status, and that this refusal resulted in her being denied services from the MCK. She claimed that this denial of services constituted a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 5 of the Canadian Human Right Act. Furthermore, she alleged that the Department also discriminated against her by continuing to fund the MCK for the provision of these services that were allegedly being denied to her.\n[3] In 2003, the Complainant settled her complaints with the MCK and the Department. According to the Minutes of Settlement (Settlement Agreement), the Complainant agreed to release and forever discharge the Department from all manner of actions, claims or demands, of whatsoever kind or nature in any way connected with the matters alleged in the complaint against the Department.\n[4] The Settlement Agreement was later approved by the Commission, pursuant to s. 48(1) of the Act and, at the Commission's application, it was made an Order of the Federal Court, pursuant to s. 48(3) of the Act.\n[5] In 2005, the Complainant filed new complaints against the MCK and the Department. She also filed a compliant against the Council of Elders alleging that it had discriminated against her under s. 5 of the Act, in its determination on July 25, 2005, that she did not satisfy the membership criteria to be recognized as a member of the Band. In the 2005 complaint against the Department, the Complainant alleges that the discrimination against her by the Council of Elders was a direct result of the Department's allowance of this type of discrimination and its lack of intervention to prevent it. The Complainant also holds the Department responsible for the denial to her of services by the MCK.\nThe res judicata issue\n[6] The Department contends that pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata, the Tribunal cannot revive or relitigate her claims against the Department as those issues were already raised in the 1999 complaint against the Department and were validly and conclusively settled in the Settlement Agreement.\n[7] For the doctrine of res judicata to apply:\nThe same issues or cause of action must be decided in both proceedings; The decision which is said to create the estoppel must be a final decision; and The parties or their privies must be the same.\n(See O'Connor v. Canadian National Railways Co., 2006 CHRT 5 at para. 27.)\n[8] In the present case, the Department alleges that the Complainant has raised the same issues or causes of action in both complaints, centring on the Department's power and duty to intervene and prevent the MCK's discriminatory practices in the delivery or provision of services and benefits.\n[9] The Department asserts that its role has not changed since the first complaint was filed in 1999. There is no evidence before the Tribunal, however, at this stage of the case, to support this assertion. The parties have yet to even file their Statements of Particulars pursuant to the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure.\n[10] Furthermore, the Complainant has stated in the 2005 complaint that the Department's alleged discriminatory practice is linked to the decision by the Council of Elders to refuse her Band membership. The Department contends that the activities of the Council of Elders can be subsumed with those of the MCK and that thus, the parties and issues in both the 1999 and 2005 complaints are identical. There is no evidence before the Tribunal at this stage, however, to confirm this contention.\n[11] In addition, the Complainant refers, in the 2005 complaint, to a Membership Law that the MCK adopted in 2004 (after the Settlement Agreement), which has contributed to the discrimination that she has experienced, by failing to recognize her as a Band member. The Department responds that this new fact is not material, as the basic issues in the 1999 and 2005 complaints are the same, i.e., is it within the power of the Department or the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, under the Indian Act, to address the recognition of the Complainant as a member of the MCK Band? This question was resolved through the settlement, it is argued, and the doctrine of res judicata bars us from reconsidering it. In my view, however, the question regarding the Membership Act and its implications for this case is one that should be determined on the basis of an evidentiary record.\n[12] I therefore find that the preliminary exception raised by the Department is premature at this stage. I make a similar finding with respect to the Department's subsidiary submission that to continue with this matter would constitute an abuse of process. I am not ruling that the Department's allegations are without any merit, but the determination thereof requires a more complete record.\n[13] Therefore, while I am dismissing the Department's motion at this time, I reserve the Department's right to present a similar motion at a later stage in the hearing process.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Jensen Date: June 4, 2008 Citation: 2008 CHRT 19\n[1] The Complainants in this case have alleged that the Respondent discriminated against them on the basis of their religion by refusing to hire them or terminating their employment because they would not shorten the length of their skirts and\/or wear pants on the job. The Complainants are devout practicing Muslim women. They cover their bodies, by among other things, wearing a long skirt and a headscarf. The original complaint form alleges discrimination on the basis of religion only. The Commission seeks to add discrimination on the basis of sex to the complaint.\n[2] In its motion, the Commission states that the proposed amendment arises out of the same set of factual allegations as the original complaints, and that it will not be putting forward any new facts to support the proposed amendment. On the basis of this assertion and the Commission\u2019s indication that it intends to rely on the material filed by the parties in relation to the complaints, the Respondent, United Parcel Service, has not opposed the motion.\n[3] The Tribunal has discretion to amend complaints. The question is whether the proposed amendment would seriously undermine the fairness of the process. If a proposed amendment opens up a new and unanticipated route of inquiry, it will not usually be allowed. The practical issue is usually whether the respondent has had sufficient notice to meet the requirements of natural justice (Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces 2005 CHRT 1, at para. 18).\n[4] In the present case, the amendment sought would not alter the allegations of fact set out in the complaints. It would merely insert a reference to another ground of discrimination. This change does not put the Respondent at a disadvantage since the change has not altered the facts of the complaints. The allegations in the complaint encompass both gender and religion as the bases for the alleged discriminatory conduct. The Respondent has not indicated that it will suffer any prejudice as a result of the amendment.\n[5] Therefore, the Commission\u2019s request to amend the complaint to add the allegation of discrimination on the basis of sex to the complaint is granted.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Hadjis\n[1] The Respondent, Greyhound Canada Transportation Corp. (Greyhound), alleges that the Complainant, Rachel Tourangeau, has shown complete indifference in the prosecution of her complaint and that as a result she has abandoned her claim. Greyhound has therefore moved to dismiss the complaint.\nFacts [2] Ms. Tourangeau filed her human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) on April 13, 2006. She alleged in her complaint that the staff at Greyhound's bus terminal in Fort McMurray, Alberta, subjected her to discriminatory treatment on the basis of her race and national\/ethnic origin, when she attempted to pick up her ticket and board a bus, on March 10, 2006.\n[3] The Commission referred her complaint to the Tribunal on March 8, 2007, along with a form setting out the current contact information of the parties. The Tribunal, in turn, began contacting the parties as part of its case management process. Unfortunately, the Tribunal's attempts to reach Ms. Tourangeau at the address provided by the Commission proved fruitless. Letters that the Tribunal had mailed to her, which included notices convening her to participate in case management conference calls, were returned with an indication from the post office that she had moved.\n[4] The Commission informed the Tribunal that it did not know Ms. Tourangeau's new address but that it had managed to find the address of her daughter. The Commission suggested that this address be used as an alternate for the purpose of serving documents on Ms. Tourangeau. The Tribunal therefore sent a letter to Ms. Tourangeau, by courier, care of her daughter's address. The letter was returned to the Tribunal marked unclaimed.\n[5] On October 30, 2007, Greyhound filed its present motion with the Tribunal. Greyhound sent a copy of its Notice of Motion to Ms. Tourangeau care of her daughter's address by registered mail. This time, the document was accepted by her daughter, and on November 28, 2007, Ms. Tourangeau called the Tribunal to provide her current contact information.\n[6] On December 6, 2007, Ms. Tourangeau mailed her submissions in reply to the present motion in which she states that she is still interested in pursuing her complaint against Greyhound and that she is very sorry that the Tribunal was unable to reach her by mail or telephone. She explained that she was certain that she had given her new address to someone from Human Rights who had contacted her at an earlier point.\nAnalysis [7] Greyhound contends that the Tribunal should dismiss the complaint due to Ms. Tourangeau's failure to advance her own complaint or to participate in the process in any manner since the very early stages of filing her complaint.\n[8] The Tribunal may dismiss an action for delay or want of prosecution in instances where there has been an inordinate and inexcusable delay that is likely to seriously prejudice the defendants or, alternatively, where the case has remained static for an unreasonable length of time, such that the delay constitutes an abuse of the Tribunal's process (see Johnston v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2007 CHRT 42 at paras. 29-34).\n[9] In my view, the facts of this case do not justify a dismissal. The 21 month period that has elapsed since the complaint was filed is neither inordinate nor unreasonable. I do not find the delay inexcusable either. Ms. Tourangeau claims that she had given her new contact information to someone from Human Rights. In this regard, Greyhound suggests that she probably provided that update after an earlier move. Greyhound referred me to a letter that a Commission-appointed conciliator had sent to Greyhound on January 24, 2007. In this letter, the conciliator wrote that he had been slow in following up on the file because Ms. Tourangeau had recently moved and it had taken him some time to get in touch with her. Greyhound surmises that, given the Commission's subsequent inability to provide the Tribunal with her current whereabouts, she must have moved again thereafter, without providing her new address to the Commission. That may well be, but there is no evidence before me to indicate that this failure to update the Commission was anything more than an error of omission on her part. The delay created by this error is not inexcusable.\n[10] I also draw no inference against Ms. Tourangeau from the fact that the letter sent by the Tribunal to her daughter was returned unclaimed, whereas Greyhound's Notice of Motion that was later sent to the same address was accepted. I note that Ms. Tourangeau's current address is hundreds of kilometres away from her daughter's. I do not think it appropriate to hold Ms. Tourangeau responsible for the fact that her daughter failed to claim the Tribunal's earlier letter from the post office, and forward it on to her mother.\n[11] Finally, I am not persuaded that Greyhound has been seriously prejudiced by the inconvenience it has experienced in this case, including participating in two case management conference calls that ultimately proved unproductive due to Ms. Tourangeau's absence.\n[12] For these reasons, Greyhound's motion is dismissed. Ms. Tourangeau is, however, directed to inform the Tribunal of any future changes regarding her contact information as soon as they occur.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis Date: June 5, 2008 Citation: 2008 CHRT 20\n[1] This ruling is in regard to (i) the Respondent\u2019s request that the deadlines for written submissions on final arguments be extended and that the hearing of final arguments be postponed to September 2008, and (ii) the request by the interested party Canadian Association for Free Expression (C.A.F.E.) that closing arguments be postponed in order to call at least seven more witnesses to testify while reserving the right to add further witnesses.\n[2] The present complaint was filed with the Commission on November 24, 2003. The Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal on August 24, 2005. On November 25, 2005, the Respondent filed a Notice of Constitutional Question, indicating his intention to question the constitutional applicability, validity and effect of sections 13 and 54(1), (1.1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Respondent proposed that the issue be argued as a preliminary motion. On December 6, 2005, the Respondent filed with the Tribunal his Notice of Motion on the constitutional issue together with his written submissions and Book of Authorities. On December 19, 2005, the Tribunal advised the parties that the motion would be dealt with at the hearing in the context of the factual framework of the case.\n[3] On February 3, 2006, the Attorney General of Canada exercised the right, pursuant to s. 57 of the Federal Courts Act, RSC 1985, c. F.7, to participate and adduce evidence at the hearing, as well as to make submissions, in respect of the constitutional question. In the meantime, a number of groups petitioned the Tribunal to be granted interested party status, including C.A.F.E. The Tribunal authorized the groups\u2019 participation on February 2, 2006, (Warman v. Lemire, 2006 CHRT 8) but only regarding the constitutional issue. They were not to be permitted to overlap or repeat the evidence, cross-examination, or submissions of the Complainant, the Commission, the Respondent or the Attorney General of Canada.\n[4] The Tribunal allotted time to the interested parties and the Attorney General of Canada to file their Statements of Particulars, expert reports, and related documents pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. During a case management conference held on May 19, 2006, all the parties provided their estimates for the duration of their evidence and their respective availabilities. Hearing dates were set down for a total of four weeks, extending over a period beginning on January 29, 2007, and ending on March 2, 2007.\n[5] On March 30, 2006, the Respondent wrote to the Commission requesting that documents relating to the activities of the Commission regarding hate on the Internet, beyond the scope of the present complaint, be disclosed on the ground that they were arguably relevant to the constitutional issue. In a subsequent letter dated April 28, 2006, the Respondent\u2019s counsel said that it is obviously highly relevant to this challenge that it be seen how s. 13 operates within the context of the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s broad powers and mandate.\n[6] The Commission questioned the arguable relevance of this material, arguing that the issue regarding the constitutionality of s. 13 is one of law and what was being requested went far beyond this scope, amounting to a fishing expedition. The Attorney General of Canada concurred, arguing that the Federal Court is the correct forum in which to raise the constitutional or any other legal challenge to the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion of the investigation of the complaint or to address any allegation of institutional or systemic bias on the part of the Commission towards those who advocate particular views.\n[7] The parties joined issue, therefore, on this disclosure question and after formal submissions were filed, the Tribunal issued a ruling on August 16, 2006 (Warman v. Lemire, 2006 CHRT 32), authorizing in part the disclosure being sought by the Respondent. It is noted in the ruling (at paras. 31-33) that the Respondent claimed that he was seeking this disclosure because he intended to argue that the deleterious effects of s. 13 of the Act may be so severe that the measure is not justified by the purposes it intends to serve, in reference to the proportionality test set out in R. v Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103. The Respondent assured the Tribunal that it was not a review of the lawfulness of the Commission\u2019s activities that he was seeking, but rather a review of whether the deleterious effects of the legislation on freedom of speech outweigh the salutary effects (para. 37).\n[8] The Tribunal found that the parties on each side of the issue raised interesting points that could be properly submitted before the Tribunal adjudicating on the merits of the constitutional challenge and the complaint as a whole (Warman v. Lemire, 2006 CHRT 32).\n[9] In the ensuing months, a debate developed between the Commission and the Respondent about whether the Commission\u2019s disclosure of documents in respect of the Commission activities issue was complete. In replying to a motion that the Respondent had filed in this regard, the Commission presented supporting affidavits from two of its employees, Dean Steacy and Harvey Goldberg. On January 16, 2007, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of his intention to cross-examine Messrs. Steacy and Goldberg on these affidavits. He also asked that the proceedings, which were scheduled to begin two weeks later, be adjourned.\n[10] On January 26, 2007, the Tribunal advised the parties that all outstanding issues of disclosure and adjournment would be dealt with at the opening of the hearing, on January 29, 2007, in Toronto. On that first day, the Respondent requested subpoenas for Messrs. Steacy and Goldberg, as well as Ms. Hannya Rizk, another Commission employee, in order to have them testify. The Respondent amended his witness list to include these individuals. The Tribunal agreed to issue the subpoenas. Given that the hearing was about to begin, the Tribunal accepted the Respondent\u2019s suggestion that those three witnesses testify in Ottawa, where they reside, during a one-day hearing to be held following the four weeks that had already been scheduled.\n[11] Several weeks later, as the hearing was progressing, the parties indicated to the Tribunal that it would be preferable to reserve separate hearing dates for final arguments, some time after the close of evidence, in order to better enable the parties to prepare and organize their submissions. Three days (May 9 to 11, 2007) were therefore set aside for that purpose.\n[12] The initial four weeks of hearings, held in Toronto and Mississauga, ended on March 1, 2007, the parties declaring that there would be no other witnesses called other than the three who remained to testify in Ottawa (Mr. Steacy, Mr. Goldberg and Ms. Rizk). Although one day had originally been set aside for their evidence, due to Ms. Rizk\u2019s unavailability, the three days in May that had been previously reserved for final arguments were reallocated to hearing the witnesses. Ms. Rizk testified on May 9, 2007, and Mr. Steacy testified on May 10, 2007. The May 11th date was cancelled due to the illness of Commission counsel. Mr. Goldberg, therefore, testified over a three-day period, from June 25 to 27, 2007, the three new days that had been set for arguments after the May 9 to 11 dates had been reallocated to hear witnesses. Thus, the one extra day that had been originally allocated to hear three witnesses ending up being extended to five days.\n[13] Pursuant to undertakings made during Mr. Goldberg\u2019s testimony, the Commission disclosed, in July 2007, a series of documents, said to number 300 pages in total.\n[14] During the course of Mr. Steacy\u2019s and Ms. Rizk\u2019s testimonies, the Commission made a number of objections under s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act. As the Federal Court has the exclusive authority to rule on such objections, the questions objected to remained unanswered.\n[15] On May 17, 2007, the Respondent filed an application to the Federal Court for adjudication of the s. 37 objections, and on July 5, 2007, the Respondent sought an adjournment of proceedings sine die from the Tribunal, pending the outcome of the Federal Court application. On August 17, 2007, the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s request for an adjournment (Warman v. Lemire, 2007 CHRT 37). The Tribunal noted that had any of the parties indicated that they had any other evidence to adduce, aside from that which related to the s. 37 objection, the Tribunal would have continued the hearing pending the outcome of the Federal Court application, but that was not the case.\n[16] The Federal Court ultimately ruled, on January 15, 2008, that it could not properly consider the s. 37 application, given the Commission\u2019s disclosure a few weeks earlier of the information regarding which the Commission had previously invoked s. 37.\n[17] Consequently, the Tribunal directed that Ms. Rizk and Mr. Steacy could be recalled by the Respondent to testify and answer the previously objected to questions and any follow-up questions directly related to those answers. Both Ms. Rizk and Mr. Steacy therefore testified on March 25, 2008.\n[18] On March 31, 2008, the Respondent petitioned the Tribunal for an order that the Commission disclose additional documents and information. The Commission replied on April 10, 2008, that it did not oppose the order sought, although it noted that the records responsive of the request will be of little or no relevance.\n[19] The Commission sent a portion of the documents to the Respondent and other parties on April 25, 2008, and the remaining portion of ten additional pages was sent on May 1, 2008. The Commission had redacted some information from these documents, including the names and contact information of some individuals. On May 5, 2008, the Respondent contested these redactions and sought their full disclosure in original form. The Tribunal will be addressing this request in a separate ruling. The Respondent also sought an order to have final arguments, which had been rescheduled for June 11 to 13, 2008, postponed again to a later date to allow the Respondent to obtain disclosure of the documents in their original form and to apply to enter the documents as exhibits in the case.\n[20] On May 12, 2008, the Tribunal agreed to extend the dates. The parties were asked to provide the Tribunal with their availability in the weeks of July 7th and 14th, 2008, for final arguments. The Tribunal also authorized the Respondent to file any of the recently disclosed documents directly into evidence by submitting them to the Tribunal Registry in a binder.\n[21] The Respondent was apparently not satisfied with the extension given. On May 13, 2008, the Respondent wrote again to the Tribunal requesting a further extension for written submissions to August 2008 and carrying forward the hearing on final arguments to September 2008. His counsel pointed out that the case involves thousands of pages of exhibits and transcripts and she would have difficulty meeting her deadlines. She added that she is working alone while some of the other parties have the benefit of having more than one counsel assigned to the case.\n[22] Parallel to the Respondent\u2019s requests for extensions, the interested party C.A.F.E. was making its own requests. On May 5, 2008, the interested party C.A.F.E. informed the Tribunal that it supported the Respondent\u2019s request for the suspension of deadlines until at least the autumn and made a demand that the hearing be re-opened to hear further testimony occasioned by the material in the last minute disclosures or that may be revealed in the unredacted disclosures that were being sought by the Respondent.\n[23] On May 13, 2008, the interested party C.A.F.E. made a formal motion of its own to postpone closing argument dates and to call additional witnesses. The interested party C.A.F.E. also made a motion to argue Apprehension of Bias by the Tribunal member in this case. This latter motion will be dealt with in a separate ruling.\n[24] The interested party C.A.F.E. states in its motion that it proposes calling at least seven witnesses, including Mr. Steacy and Mr. Goldberg. The interested party C.A.F.E. also reserves itself the right to add further witnesses. The reason given for its request is the extremely late and incomplete disclosure by the Commission. The interested party C.A.F.E. also raises the ridiculous obstruction by Mr. Steacy, who has restricted vision, in not bringing his assistant along when he testified on March 25, 2008, thus forcing counsel to read documents to him. One must wonder, however, how using the intermediary of the assistant to read the documents to him would have been any faster.\n[25] The alleged late and incomplete disclosure consists of the documents communicated in July 2007 after Mr. Goldberg testified and the documents that the Commission provided in April\/May 2008, pursuant to the Respondent\u2019s March 31, 2008 letter.\nAnalysis [26] As I already indicated, this complaint was referred to the Tribunal almost three years ago. Section 48.9 (1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act provides that proceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. There is a duty upon human rights tribunals, and other tribunals as well, to ensure the timely disposition of complaints, a point that was highlighted by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Nova Scotia Construction Safety Association v. Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, 2006 NSCA 63, at paras. 76-7:\n[76] Recognizing the well known principle that a key objective of human rights legislation is to be remedial, the process for inquiring into and exposing acts of discrimination must be expeditious in order to be effective. Otherwise, the salutary benefit of public scrutiny, enlightenment and appropriate redress in the face of proved violations, is lost. An efficient and timely disposition of complaints is in the interest of both complainants and those whose behaviour is impugned. It is also in the public interest. People and businesses need to get on with their lives. Unlike fine wine, protracted human rights litigation does not improve with age.\n[77] In this I find the observations of LeBel, J., although in dissent, in [Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44,] especially apt:\n140 Unnecessary delay in judicial and administrative proceedings has long been an enemy of a free and fair society. At some point, it is a foe that has plagued the life of almost all courts and administrative tribunals. It\u2019s a problem that must be brought under control if we are to maintain an effective system of justice, worthy of the confidence of Canadians. ...\n[27] More recently, in a case dealing with the judicial review of a Tribunal decision, Canada Post v. P.S.A.C. 2008 FC 223 at paras. 264-5, the Federal Court made similar observations, noting that a legal hearing without discipline and timeliness both delays and denies justice. The Court went on to recite the well-known axiom, justice delayed is justice denied, adding that a fair hearing is not a continuous process. A fair hearing is one where a party knows the case against it and has an opportunity of addressing that case within a reasonable time, at which point the Tribunal has a duty to adjudicate upon the case.\n[28] These observations by the courts have been reflected in the Tribunal\u2019s Practice Note No. 1, entitled Timeliness of Hearings and Decisions, which is found on the Tribunal\u2019s website, http:\/\/www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca\/about\/tribunalrules_e.asp. The Practice Note concludes with a reminder to all participants in Tribunal inquiries of their obligation to assist in the timely completion of the hearing and deliberation process and of the Tribunal\u2019s intention to adhere firmly to Parliament\u2019s directive in subsection 48.9(1) of the Act.\n[29] There is another compelling reason to move in a timely manner that is specific to this case. As the Respondent noted in his submissions, a judicial review of a Tribunal decision is currently before the Federal Court, the proceedings of which have been stayed since April 2, 2007, pending the disposition of the present case (Kulbashian v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 2007 FC 354). The Court indicated that the outcome of the present hearing and any subsequent application for judicial review will provide it with guidance in deciding the Kulbashian case. I also understand that in at least one other s. 13 case currently pending before the Tribunal, the portion of the hearing dealing with a similar constitutional challenge has also been deferred, pending the outcome of this case. Thus, the longer it takes for the present case to run its course, the longer these - and perhaps other cases - will remain pending.\n[30] The parties in the present case, including the interested parties, confirmed to the Tribunal that they had no intention to call any other witnesses after the testimonies of the three Commission employees, which would have been completed on June 27, 2007, after Mr. Goldberg\u2019s evidence, were it not for the s. 37 objections and ensuing application to the Federal Court for determinations thereof.\n[31] The interested party C.A.F.E. claims that witnesses should be recalled and new ones summoned because of the late disclosure of documents arising from Mr. Goldberg\u2019s evidence. However, those documents have been in C.A.F.E.\u2019s possession since July 2007. No request ever came to call new evidence in this regard until the last few weeks. The Tribunal did receive a request from the Respondent that these documents be entered directly into the record without the necessity of recalling the witness, and that request was granted. The communication of documents by the Commission in July 2007 does not, therefore, justify the recall of witnesses and calling of new witnesses at this stage.\n[32] With respect to the documents provided in April and May 2008, the Tribunal has allowed their entry into evidence as well. More importantly, I have looked at all of these documents and quite simply, the documents speak for themselves. A portion of them are emails made by Mr. Steacy under an assumed name, similar to those upon which he testified. The remaining documents, which make up the bulk of the material in question, demonstrate that the Commission cooperates with several community groups and police services on matters relating to s. 13. These are basically the facts alleged in the Respondent\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars dated December 18, 2006, at paragraph 75, in support of his arguments on the constitutional issue:\n75. The Commission itself states that the complaint process is only one part of what it terms the broader fight against hate motivated activity in Canada. It works with ISP\u2019s, NGO\u2019s, the police and government departments in extra-judicial ways to stop the viewpoints which it deems to be hate. It is empowered by its legislation to undertake this destruction of free speech behind closed doors in private meetings and with favoured groups and organizations. The Commission works closely with Edmonton, Alberta and London, Ontario Police Hate Crime Units, among others, to seize computers and evidence in raids on the homes of people whom Mr. Warman has filed complaints against. This evidence is later used at Tribunal hearings. Section 13 is being used as a de facto criminal provision, using the police power of search and seizure to obtain evidence. Most of these people are never subsequently charged under the Criminal Code.\nFurthermore, ample evidence of the cooperation between the Commission and police services as well as community groups has already been adduced during the earlier hearings. I do not see why this evidence needs to be revisited. As the Supreme Court noted in R. v. Malmo-Levine; R. v. Caine, 2003 SCC 74, at para. 27, a trial judge is not required to listen to repetitive evidence that does not advance the work of the court.\n[33] What remains, therefore, to be determined is whether, on the one hand, the impugned Commission activity is evidence that the deleterious effects of s. 13 on freedom of speech are so severe that they outweigh the salutary effects, as the Respondent and some of the interested parties contend, or whether on the other hand, evidence of such activity has no bearing on the proportionality analysis to be conducted under s. 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as the Commission, the Attorney General, the Complainant and the other interested parties contend. This question will be addressed in final arguments, as I have said repeatedly during the case whenever I have ruled, over the emphatic objections of the Commission and the Attorney General, that this sort of evidence can be adduced.\n[34] The interested party C.A.F.E.\u2019s motion to recall witnesses and call additional witnesses is therefore dismissed.\n[35] With respect to the Respondent\u2019s motion for an extension beyond the one which was already granted earlier this month, the Tribunal is obviously mindful of the significant amount of letters, motions, exhibits, and other documents exchanged in this case and particularly over the last few weeks. The Tribunal is also aware that the July hearing dates that it suggested to the parties in response to the extension requests were determined without any prior consultation with the parties as to their specific availability for three consecutive days during the weeks in July that the Tribunal is available. What is of fundamental importance to the Tribunal at this stage is ensuring that parties and their counsel be fully prepared to present all of their arguments to the Tribunal on all of the significant questions of law and fact in this case. In the circumstances, but in keeping with the requirement for an expeditious yet fair process, I see no harm in granting an extension for a few more weeks, thereby ensuring everyone\u2019s total preparation and availability for final arguments.\n[36] As a result, the deadlines for written submissions can be rescheduled as well. The Attorney General has indicated that he takes exception to the accordance of additional time to the other parties to prepare their written submissions, claiming that unfairness would arise from their having viewed his submissions, which he filed on schedule on May 9, 2008. With respect, I do not see the prejudice. The whole point of the exercise is to place material before the Tribunal so that it may better understand the positions of the parties, particularly as they are presented during their oral arguments. If the Attorney General feels it important to supplement its submissions due to the subsequent filings by the others, he may do so in accordance with the deadlines outlined in the following schedule:\nThe Complainant and Canadian Human Rights Commission will file their submissions on the merits by August 6, 2008;\nThe Complainant, the Canadian Human Rights Commission, and the Respondent will file their submissions on the constitutional issue by August 6, 2008;\nThe Respondent will file his submissions on the merits by August 22, 2008;\nWith regard to the constitutional issue, the responding submissions of the main parties (and this of course would include the Attorney General of Canada, in reference to my earlier comments) and the principal submissions of the interested parties will be filed by August 22, 2008.\n[37] The parties are to provide the Tribunal registry with their dates of availability in the weeks of September 8 or 15, 2008, for a hearing to be conducted in the western sector of the Greater Toronto Area.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n[1] On December 13, 2007, the Tribunal issued a decision in which it found that the Respondents have been discriminating against the Complainants by treating them differently from the male-dominated group of medical advisors working in the CPP Disability Benefit Program, who perform substantially similar work to that of the Complainants. In particular, the Tribunal held that the Respondents' refusal, since March of 1978, to recognize the professional nature of the work performed by the medical adjudicators in a manner proportionate to the professional recognition accorded to the work of the medical advisors, was discriminatory. Upon the request of the parties, the Tribunal declined to order a remedy for the discriminatory practice. It gave the parties time to negotiate a remedy, failing which the Tribunal would make a conclusive determination after providing the parties with an opportunity to present evidence if necessary, and argument. The parties were unsuccessful in reaching an agreement. Therefore, a hearing was set for the week of July 28 - August 1, 2008.\n[2] The Respondents have brought a motion requesting permission to lead evidence on their proposal for redressing the discriminatory practice. They would also like to adduce evidence with regard to whether the discriminatory practice resulted in any wage loss to the Complainants and, if so, what the basis for calculating the loss should be.\nEvidence Regarding the Proposal to Redress the Discriminatory Practice\n[3] The Respondents' proposal to redress the discriminatory practice identified in the December 13, 2007 decision of the Tribunal is that a new Nursing (NU) classification be created within the Health Services (SH) Group which would include medical adjudicators. There are currently two sub-groups under the NU classification: Hospital Nursing (HOS) and Community Health Nursing (CHN). The proposal would see a third sub-group added to the NU Classification.\n[4] The Respondents assert that the Tribunal needs to hear from Patricia Power, Senior Advisor to the Vice-President of Strategic Infrastructure, Organization and Classification Sector, Canada Public Service Agency and Charles Tardiff, Project Coordinator and Senior Researcher, Expenditure Analysis and Compensation, Planning Division, Treasury Board Secretariat, to understand why the discriminatory practice is best redressed by the creation of a third NU sub-group for the medical adjudicators.\n[5] Counsel for some of the Complainants and the Canadian Human Rights Commission are both in disagreement with the Respondents' position. They contend that a new NU category is not appropriate. Rather, the medical adjudicators and medical advisors must share a classification standard, although they may be separated by different levels within that classification. Both parties argue that this remedy is implicit in the Tribunal's December 13, 2007 decision. They contend that nothing further is needed than an order from this Tribunal requiring the creation of a new classification standard that encompasses the work of both the adjudicators and the advisors. Treasury Board must then exercise its exclusive authority to classify positions within the Federal Public Service to create this classification standard. There is no need, according to the Complainants and the Commission, for further evidence on this issue.\n[6] I agree with the Respondents that they should be permitted to adduce evidence regarding their proposal for redressing the discriminatory practice. In paragraph 138 of the December 2007 decision, I provided examples of the action that Treasury Board might have taken to address the concerns that had been raised over the years by the adjudicators about the classification of their position. However, the examples in that paragraph were not provided as possible remedies for the discriminatory practice that was found to exist in the December 2007 decision. Indeed, I left that issue open for the parties to negotiate or, in the event that they were unsuccessful, for the Tribunal to conclusively determine after the parties had been given a chance to adduce further evidence (if necessary) and make submissions.\n[7] The Respondents have a proposal regarding the remedy that they think is most appropriate in the circumstances. Ms. Power and Mr. Tardiff will provide evidence to support that proposal. The Complainants are free to challenge the evidence and the proposal as well as arguing that their position is preferable to that of the Respondents. The Complainants are certainly free to call evidence of their own should they see fit. However, it would be unfair for the Tribunal to deny the Respondents the opportunity to call evidence and make arguments with respect to their proposal, given that the December 2007 decision did not provide an indication of what the appropriate remedy would be and indeed, left open the option of presenting evidence and argument on that issue.\nEvidence Regarding the Existence of and Compensation for Wage Loss Resulting from the Discriminatory Practice\n[8] In order to calculate compensation for any lost wages which may have resulted from the Respondents' discriminatory practice, the adjudicators' wages must be compared to the wages of an appropriate comparator group. The Respondents assert that the appropriate comparator group is the NU-CHN-02 or NU-CHN-03 position, not the medical advisors, to whom the Tribunal compared the work of the adjudicators in the December 2007 decision. They base this assertion on the fact that in the December 2007 decision, the Tribunal found the work of the adjudicators and advisors to be sufficiently different to justify a different level of classification and a difference in salary and benefits. Therefore, according to the Respondents, the medical advisor position is not an appropriate comparator. The Respondents assert that their position is further supported by the Tribunal's decision to bifurcate the hearing, and the fact that the medical adjudicators have, until recently, sought recognition as nurses.\n[9] In my view, it is both appropriate and necessary to engage in a comparison of the wages and work of the advisors and the adjudicators for the purpose of determining whether a wage loss has resulted from the discriminatory practice. Section 53(2)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act provides the Tribunal with the authority to compensate the victim(s) for any or all of the wages that the victim(s) were deprived of as a result of the discriminatory practice. The discriminatory practice that was identified by the Tribunal in the December 2007 decision was not the Respondents' refusal to classify the adjudicators as nurses. Rather, the Tribunal found that the Respondents are pursuing a discriminatory practice of treating the advisors and the adjudicators as though they were doing different work even though they were doing substantially similar work, and classifying them accordingly (Walden et al v. Social Development Canada et al, 2007 CHRT 56, at paras. 11, 95 and 143). The remedy must flow from the differential treatment of the adjudicators relative to the advisors. This requires a comparison of the relative value of the work performed by the adjudicators and the advisors.\n[10] However, a determination of the value of the work performed by the adjudicators relative to the advisors does not preclude a comparison of the value of the adjudicators' work to the value of other positions such as the NU-CHN-02 and NU-CHN-03 positions. It may be that the comparison between the advisors and the adjudicators reveals that the value of the adjudicators' work is equivalent to that of the NU-CHN-02 or NU-CHN-03. In that case, the Respondents might argue that the adjudicators' wage loss should be determined on the basis of a comparison with the wages of the CHN positions at the relevant time. The Complainants and the Commission are, of course, free to lead evidence of a different nature and to argue that the wage loss should be differently calculated.\n[11] It would be of assistance to the Tribunal to hear testimony from a job evaluation expert regarding the various means of determining the value of the adjudicators' work relative to that of the advisors. Therefore, the Tribunal grants the Respondents' request to open the hearing to receive evidence from a job evaluation expert on the understanding that the appropriateness of using the medical advisor position as a comparator must be addressed.\nPain and Suffering\n[12] In the December 2007 decision, the Tribunal found that some compensation should be provided to the Complainants pursuant to s. 53(2)(e) of the Act for the pain and suffering that they experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice. The Tribunal left the quantum of this award to be negotiated by the parties or to be determined by the Tribunal if no agreement was reached. The parties have been unable to agree to the quantum and therefore, this matter will be determined following the hearing on remedy.\n[13] The Tribunal is in agreement with the parties that no further evidence is needed on this point. However, to assist in the determination of the quantum, it would be helpful to have a complete list of the Complainants (both unrepresented and represented by counsel) with the start and end dates (in the event that they are no longer employed there) of their employment with the CPP Disability Benefit Program.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Hadjis Date: June 9, 2008 Citation: 2008 CHRT 22\n[1] On May 16, 2008, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) applied for leave to intervene in the Constitutional Challenge of ss. 13 and 54 of the Canadian Human Rights Act before this Tribunal. It is seeking permission to file a written argument, introduce evidence, receive and reply to all other parties\u2019 arguments and evidence regarding the proper interpretation of ss. 13 and 54, to cross-examine witnesses and to present oral argument. The BCCLA does not anticipate calling witnesses but requests permission to apply for the right in the future.\n[2] The Commission, the Complainant and the Attorney General of Canada have objected to the BCCLA\u2019s request.\n[3] As was noted in the Tribunal\u2019s recent ruling in the present case, which dealt with a similar request by the Canadian Constitutional Foundation (CCF) (Warman v. Lemire, 2008 CHRT 7), the Tribunal has wide discretion with respect to the granting of interested party status. Just like the CCF, however, the BCCLA has made its request extremely late in this hearing\u2019s process, as we approach the dates for final oral submissions, after having heard over five weeks of evidence. The present circumstances thus differ significantly from those that were before the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal, which recently granted the BCCLA intervenor status before the commencement of the hearing (Elmasry v. Roger\u2019s Publishing Ltd., 2008 BCHRT 199).\n[4] The BCCLA claims that it had intended to seek interested party status in the present case as early as 2006 but that it was unable to secure legal counsel to represent it. That may well be, but the fact remains that its request actually arrived in May 2008. The concerns and issues raised by the Tribunal in the earlier ruling denying the CCF\u2019s request to intervene at this late stage apply equally to the BCCLA.\n[5] As was noted in that ruling as well, nothing prevents the BCCLA from sharing any specific arguments that it feels are relevant to the constitutional issue with those parties in this case who are challenging the constitutionality of ss. 13 and 54.\n[6] The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association\u2019s request is therefore denied.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n[1] Nanette Hunt brought a complaint against her former employer, Transport One Ltd., alleging that she was sexually harassed by Harry Wadhwa, the General Manager of Transport One Ltd., and Wayne Dibbley, a dispatcher with Transport One Ltd.\n[2] No one appeared at the hearing on behalf of the Respondent, Transport One Ltd. Moreover, the Respondent did not participate in the case conferences that were held prior to the hearing. The Tribunal sent numerous letters by courier and mail to two addresses in Windsor, Ontario informing Mr. Wadhwa about the case conferences and the hearing into this matter.\n[3] Notwithstanding the Tribunal's efforts to invite the Respondent's representative(s) to participate in the case management and inquiry process, they chose not to respond to the Tribunal, to present themselves for the case management conferences or to appear for the hearing.\n[4] Rule 9(8) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure authorizes the Tribunal to proceed with an inquiry into the complaint even though a party fails to appear before the Tribunal where the Tribunal is satisfied that the party received proper notice of the hearing. Although the rules cannot expand the Tribunal's legal authority, they do serve as notice to the parties of measures that may be taken by the Tribunal in conducting an inquiry into the complaint.\n[5] The Tribunal was satisfied that the Respondent received proper notice of the hearing, and therefore, that it was fair to proceed with the hearing in the absence of the Respondent.\n[6] At the hearing, Ms. Hunt testified about the incidents that gave rise to the filing of her complaint on September 19, 2005. Although she was not cross-examined since the Respondent did not appear at the hearing, I found Ms. Hunt's testimony to be forthright, sincere and consistent; I found her to be a credible witness. There were no other witnesses.\n[7] The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not appear at the hearing.\n[8] Ms. Hunt testified that on July 14, 2005, she was hired by Mr. Harry Wadhwa as an office manager for a new transportation brokerage company by the name of Transport One Ltd. located in Windsor, Ontario. Ms. Hunt started work on July 25, 2005. In the beginning, the only people working at Transport One Ltd. were Ms. Hunt and Mr. Wadhwa. However, shortly after she was hired, Mr. Wadhwa hired Mr. Wayne Dibbley as a dispatcher. Later, Mr. Wadhwa hired Mr. Mike Bronson to be the Sales Manager of Transport One Ltd.\n[9] Ms. Hunt, Mr. Wadhwa, Mr. Dibbley, and then latterly, Mr. Bronson, all worked together in a 40 foot trailer. The legal relationship between Harry Wadhwa and the Respondent Transport One Ltd. was unclear. At the hearing, Ms. Hunt adduced evidence that Mr. Wadhwa's parents owned the property on which the trailer was parked. Ms. Hunt thought that Mr. Wadhwa shared ownership of the company with his parents. She said that Mr. Wadhwa ran the operation, and that his parents were not involved in the day-to-day functioning of the business. On the basis of this evidence, I find that, at the very least, Mr. Wadhwa acted as the agent of the Respondent Corporation in hiring employees and in directing the overall operations of Transport One Ltd.\n[10] Ms. Hunt's office was at the east end of the Transport One Ltd. trailer\/office. Her computer was the only one that had Internet access. As a result, Mr. Wadhwa and Mr. Dibbley often leaned over her to view her monitor or asked Ms. Hunt to get out of her chair so that they could use her computer to gain access to the Internet.\n[11] On August 18, 2005, Mr. Dibbley and Ms. Hunt were working alone in the Transport One Ltd. trailer\/office. Mr. Dibbley began making comments of a sexual nature about Ms. Hunt's physical appearance, stating, among other things, that she looked good in jeans and that he liked it when she bent over her desk. Ms. Hunt ignored the comments and continued to do her work, hoping that Mr. Dibbley would stop.\n[12] On August 18, Ms. Hunt was wearing a jacket with a t-shirt underneath. The jacket zipper was \u00be of the way down. After making the comments noted above, Mr. Dibbley came up behind Ms. Hunt and reached around in front of her. He grasped the zipper on her jacket and began pulling it up. As he did so he rubbed her breasts. In an angry voice, Ms. Hunt asked him what he was doing. Mr. Dibbley replied that her chest was distracting him. He then went over to the trailer door, opened it and stood on the threshold staring at Ms. Hunt. Mr. Dibbley told Ms. Hunt that he needed some fresh air to settle down what was happening in his pants. After that, he left the trailer for a few minutes.\n[13] When he came back into the trailer later that same morning on August 18, 2005, Mr. Dibbley approached Ms. Hunt again and told her to unzip her zipper stating that he liked the view better that way. He kept staring at her chest area and making sexual comments. Ms. Hunt testified that she was visibly upset; she was crying and sulking. She said she felt sick and on the verge of vomiting at work. She was outraged by Mr. Dibbley's behaviour.\n[14] In the afternoon of August 18, Mr. Wadhwa called Ms. Hunt at the office and asked her to drive over to his house and take him to work. Ms. Hunt complied with the request. She stated that after she returned to the office with Mr. Wadhwa, she was still very upset about the events of the morning; she was crying and sulking. Ms. Hunt left the trailer at one point during the afternoon of August 18 because she was so upset. While she was standing outside the trailer crying, Mr. Wadhwa approached her. He put his arm around her and told Ms. Hunt that all she needed was a good man to give it to her.\n[15] Ms. Hunt did not testify about her response to Mr. Wadhwa's embrace and comment. She was unrepresented during the hearing and at times, clearly found it difficult to relate her experiences to the Tribunal without assistance. It was also apparent to me that Ms. Hunt did not think that she needed to go into all of the details of her complaint because they were in the complaint form that she had submitted to the Commission.\n[16] In her complaint, Ms. Hunt said that she responded to Mr. Wadhwa's suggestion that all she needed was a good man to give it to her by asking him if he knew one (a good man). His reply was plenty, pointing to himself as he spoke. Ms. Hunt stated in her complaint that at that point, she turned and walked back into the office, grabbed her keys and left.\n[17] I accept the information in Ms. Hunt's complaint as sufficiently reliable to fill the gap left in her testimony regarding her response to Mr. Wadhwa. Although Ms. Hunt did not seek to have her complaint entered into evidence, the Tribunal is entitled, pursuant to s. 58(3)(c) of the Act, to accept information where it sees fit even if that information would not be admissible in a court of law. The complaint form is signed by Ms. Hunt and dated September 19, 2005, a short time after the incidents occurred. The information in the complaint was therefore produced while it was still fresh in her memory. For these reasons, I have accepted the information provided therein with regard to this particular incident.\n[18] Ms. Hunt testified that on August 19, 2005 she again found herself working alone with Mr. Dibbley. She stated that Mr. Dibbley kept coming over to her desk, asking her to move, brushing up against her or reaching around her. That morning, Mr. Wadhwa again called to ask Ms. Hunt to drive him to work. When Ms. Hunt attempted to leave the trailer to go pick Mr. Wadhwa up, Mr. Dibbley blocked her way to the door with his arm. She attempted to get past him several times, but he would not let her pass. Ms. Hunt then used more force to push her way past Mr. Dibbley, but as she did so Mr. Dibbley rubbed her breast and stomach area. Ms. Hunt was extremely upset by this incident.\n[19] When she picked Mr. Wadhwa up from his home, Ms. Hunt told him what had happened and how upset she was about it. Mr. Wadhwa's response was that it'll be o.k..\n[20] Upon her arrival at work on August 22, 2005, Ms. Hunt learned that Mr. Dibbley had been assigned to do dispatch work in the afternoons. This meant that she would see less of Mr. Dibbley in the foreseeable future. However, she was still worried about what might happen with Mr. Wadhwa.\n[21] On August 24, 2005 Ms. Hunt told Mr. Bronson, now general manager, how upset she was about the treatment she was receiving, and that she was going to look for a new job. Mr. Bronson encouraged her to stay at Transport One Ltd., stating that things would improve. He did not explain to her what he meant by this comment. Ms. Hunt decided to terminate her employment with Transport One Ltd. later that day, when Mr. Wadhwa called her a fucking idiot because she could not find a post-it note that she had placed on her computer.\n[22] As noted, the Respondent did not appear at the hearing and therefore, did not provide a response to the version of events conveyed by Ms. Hunt concerning her five weeks' of employment at Transport One Ltd.\nSexual Harassment [23] Section 14(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act stipulates that it is a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination in matters related to employment. Section 14(2) deems sexual harassment to be harassment on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[24] Sexual harassment has been defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is detrimental to the work environment (Janzen v. Platy Enterprises, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at p. 1284). In order to determine if the conduct is unwelcome, the Tribunal will look at the complainant's reaction at the time the incident occurred and assess whether she expressly, or by her behaviour, demonstrated that the conduct was unwelcome. A verbal no will not be required in all cases (Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Franke, [1999] 3 F.C. 653 (T.D.) at para. 36). Nonetheless, the complainant must establish, for instance by her body language or by her repetitive failure to respond to suggestive comments, that she had in some way signaled to the harasser that his conduct was unwelcome. A sexual advance may incite a strong refusal and outrage or may be met with stony silence and evasion. Both responses signal unwanted or unwelcome behaviour (Miller v. Sam's Pizza House, [1995] N.S.H.R.B.I.D. No. 2 (Q.L.).\n[25] The second element of the definition requires the conduct to be sexual in nature. Human rights tribunals have recognized a broad scope of conduct which may fall under the definition of sexual harassment, depending on the circumstances, including gender-based insults, sexist remarks, comments about a person's looks, dress, appearance or sexual habits (Franke, at para. 37).\n[26] Finally, fairness requires the employee, whenever possible, to notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct (Franke, at para. 47).\n[27] Harassment generally requires an element of persistence or repetition, although in certain circumstances a single incident may be enough to create a hostile work environment. Some forms of unwanted sexual attention, such as sexual assault, may be severe enough to constitute sexual harassment even though they have occurred only once. Such incidents would, because of their gravity, immediately create a poisoned work environment. The more serious the conduct and its consequences are, the less repetition is necessary; conversely, the less severe the conduct, the more persistence will have to be demonstrated (Franke, at paras. 43-45).\n[28] For example, in Goodwin v. Birkett, there was only one incident of sexual conduct but it involved physical contact (Goodwin v. Birkett, 2004 CHRT 29, at para. 22; aff'd: 2007 FC 428). The complainant awoke at 3:00 a.m. to find the respondent in her bed at a hotel, caressing her inappropriately. She told him to stop and he left the room. The Tribunal held that this incident was serious enough to poison the work environment. Therefore, it constituted sexual harassment.\n[29] In the present case, Ms. Hunt's testimony describing Mr. Dibbley's conduct meets the test for sexual harassment. There were two incidents of physical contact that were of a sexual nature: pulling Ms. Hunt's jacket zipper down; and barring her exit from the trailer. During both incidents, Mr. Dibbley fondled Ms. Hunt's breasts and stomach area. On the first occasion, he made sexually suggestive remarks to her. On the second occasion, Mr. Dibbley attempted to bar Ms. Hunt from leaving the trailer as a means of requiring her to submit to sexual touching. This was very frightening to her.\n[30] Ms. Hunt testified that she let Mr. Dibbley know that the sexual contact was unwelcome by angrily asking him what he was doing at the time of the first physical incident, and by evading him, crying and refusing to talk with him. Ms. Hunt was very upset by Mr. Dibbley's conduct; she felt sick to her stomach at work, and her ulcer symptoms flared up. Ms. Hunt informed her employer, Mr. Wadhwa, about what had happened on August 19, 2005.\n[31] Thus, although Mr. Dibbley's conduct occurred on two occasions only, the very serious and physical nature of the sexual conduct and its consequences for Ms. Hunt were enough to create a poisoned work environment.\n[32] Did Mr. Wadhwa's crude sexual proposition and embrace on August 18, 2005 constitute sexual harassment? According to Ms. Hunt's testimony, Mr. Wadhwa put his arm around her while she was outside the trailer crying, and told her that all she needed a good man to give it to her. Ms. Hunt was crying and visibly upset before Mr. Wadhwa embraced and propositioned her. Ms. Hunt's emotionally vulnerable state would have provided the first clue to her employer that his attention, which was clearly of a sexual nature, would not be welcome.\n[33] Although it is less common to analyze the complainant's behaviour prior to the impugned incident(s) to determine whether the attention was unwelcome, I think that it is appropriate to do so where, as in the present case, the complainant is in a subordinate employment relationship to the alleged harasser, and therefore may not be in a position to clearly voice her or his negative reaction to the behaviour after it has occurred. In addition, an examination of the complainant's behaviour prior to the impugned incident recognizes that it is incumbent upon those who wish to offer their sexual attention to their subordinates to ascertain, prior to offering that attention, whether it would likely be welcome.\n[34] Rather than inquiring into the source of Ms. Hunt's distress when she was outside of the trailer, Mr. Wadhwa took advantage of her emotional vulnerability and made a crude sexual proposition. In light of his authority over Ms. Hunt, Mr. Wadhwa's sexual attention took on a more coercive nature than if it had come from an employee at the same level as Ms. Hunt. Mr. Wadhwa's remark made Ms. Hunt feel all the more vulnerable at work, since the very person she was counting upon to address the situation with Mr. Dibbley had demonstrated that he too was seeking to take sexual advantage of her employment with Transport One Ltd.\n[35] After the embrace and the remark about needing a good man to give it to her, Ms. Hunt asked Mr. Wadhwa whether he knew any good men. She then turned her back on him, walked to the trailer, collected her things and left the workplace. Seen as a whole, this sequence of actions indicates that Ms. Hunt did not welcome Mr. Wadhwa's sexual attention.\n[36] I conclude that although it occurred only once, the conduct of Mr. Wadhwa, the person who hired Ms. Hunt, was sufficiently serious and unwelcome to independently create a hostile work environment for her. It therefore constituted sexual harassment.\nThe Respondent's Liability for the Sexual Harassment [37] Section 65 of the Act deems the act of an officer, a director, an employee or an agent of an organization in the course of employment, to be the act of the organization unless the organization can establish that it did not consent to the commission of the act, and that it exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or to mitigate or avoid the effect of the act.\n[38] An employer make take a number of measures to prevent harassment from occurring in the workplace including: instructing newly hired employees that harassment will not be tolerated in the workplace; providing information sessions about harassment to employees, supervisors and directors of the company; developing harassment policies and investigation procedures and posting them in a public place. Effective strategies to mitigate the effects of harassment include: providing information to the individuals involved about the process and measures that will be taken to address the alleged harassment; providing separate work spaces for the alleged harasser and the complainant; conducting a timely and fair investigation of complaints of harassment; taking appropriate disciplinary action against harassers and providing victims with information about the disciplinary action taken; making counseling services available to the individuals involved. The appropriateness of some of these measures will depend upon the circumstances of the case.\n[39] In the present case, there was no evidence that Transport One Ltd. had taken any measures to prevent sexual harassment from occurring. There was no evidence of anti-harassment policies and investigation procedures, information sessions for employees or any other similar preventative measures.\n[40] Ms. Hunt testified that some action was taken to mitigate the effects of Mr. Dibbley's harassment of Ms. Hunt: he was moved to the afternoon shift thereby reducing the contact between the two employees. However, Ms. Hunt had no assurance that Mr. Dibbley's unwanted sexual attentions would be permanently curtailed as there had been no investigation or meaningful discussion about the problem with Mr. Wadhwa. In addition, Ms. Hunt was not informed that Mr. Dibbley had been reprimanded and told that the harassment of employees would not be tolerated. Finally, nothing was done to address the sexual harassment of Ms. Hunt by Mr. Wadhwa.\n[41] Mr. Bronson, the Sales Manager\/General Manager at Transport One Ltd., told Ms. Hunt not to quit on August 24, 2005. He told her that the situation would improve. However, there was no indication of when and how this improvement would take place. Moreover, Mr. Bronson did not explain how he was in a position to ensure that the conduct of his superior, Mr. Wadhwa, would be addressed.\n[42] For these reasons, I find that Transport One Ltd. did not exercise all due diligence to prevent the sexual harassment of Ms. Hunt and to mitigate or avoid the effects of it on her. Transport One Ltd. is, therefore, liable under s. 65(1) of the Act for the actions of Mr. Dibbley and Mr. Wadhwa.\nThe Appropriate Remedy [43] The Tribunal derives its remedial jurisdiction from s. 53 of the Act. The remedies contemplated therein are designed to stop the discrimination that is occurring from continuing, to prevent future discrimination from occurring, and to compensate individual victims for past or ongoing discriminatory practices.\n[44] Ms. Hunt testified that she thought that Transport One Ltd. may no longer be operational. She thought that it might even be bankrupt. There was, however, no evidence before me that Transport One Ltd. has been the subject of any proceedings or orders under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. In the absence of any such information, it remains appropriate for the Tribunal to exercise remedial jurisdiction under s. 53.\n[45] Ms. Hunt requested a remedy that would hold Transport One Ltd. accountable for what happened and would prevent others from experiencing the harassment that she experienced. She requested compensation in the amount of $10,000 for pain and suffering.\n[46] Ms. Hunt suffers from an ulcer. She takes medication to control the symptoms. During the five weeks that she was employed at Transport One Ltd., her ulcer symptoms flared up. She constantly felt sick to her stomach. She believed that the stress of the unwelcome sexual attention she was receiving from Mr. Dibbley and Mr. Wadhwa was the cause of the flare up. Ms. Hunt's doctor prescribed a stronger medication to treat her ulcer condition.\n[47] Although it is clear that Ms. Hunt experienced a significant degree of suffering as a result of the sexual harassment by Mr. Dibbley and Mr. Wadhwa, I think that there were other factors in the work environment that contributed to her physical and emotional distress that were not related to the discriminatory conduct. For example, Ms. Hunt testified that the lack of office equipment and the physical condition of the office environment were a source of frustration for her. She was also upset about the number of personal errands that she was asked to run for Mr. Wadhwa. In light of the fact that not all of her pain and suffering was attributable to the discriminatory conduct, I find that an award of $6,000 is appropriate in the circumstances.\n[48] In order to prevent harassment of the nature experienced by Ms. Hunt from occurring in the future, it is necessary to make an order requiring the Respondent to take certain measures. At a minimum, information (whether in the form of Policies and Procedures, or simply a statement by a company official) should be provided to everyone in the workplace which explains what harassment is, that harassment will not be tolerated, and sets out the procedures that will be followed in the event that harassment does occur. It goes without saying that any such information is only effective in preventing harassment if it is fully understood by everyone in the workplace. To that end, information sessions or sensitization programs are useful to provide employees, supervisors and company directors with the knowledge that is needed to make anti-harassment policies work.\n[49] In order to prevent discrimination of the nature experienced by Ms. Hunt from occurring in the future, it is appropriate to make the following orders, pursuant to s. 53(2)(a) of the Act:\nIf the Respondent has Sexual Harassment Policies and Procedures, it shall provide these documents to the Canadian Human Rights Commission for review. In the event that the Respondent has not developed Policies and Procedures that deal with the prevention and handling of sexual harassment complaints, it shall do so in consultation with the Commission. Once in final form, a copy of the Policies and Procedures shall be displayed in a manner that is accessible to all employees; and, The Respondent shall provide, at its own cost, a program for the employees, officers and directors of the Company to sensitize them to the issue of sexual harassment. It shall consult with the Canadian Human Rights Commission regarding the content of the program and potential program providers.\n[50] In addition, pursuant to s. 53(2)(e), the Tribunal orders that:\n3. The Respondent shall provide compensation to Ms. Hunt in the amount of $6,000 for the pain and suffering that she experienced as a result of the discriminatory conduct.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Grant Sinclair Date: June 16, 2008 Citation: 2008 CHRT 24\n[1] The Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) requests that it be added as a party to the complaints of Marie-Claire Coupal and Biserka Milinkovich against the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\n[2] Ms. Coupal was a Border Service Officer (BSO) at the Windsor Land Border crossing when CBSA introduced Use of Force Training (UFT) for its officers. The training provides BSOs with the knowledge and skills needed to deal with potential or actual conflict in the course of their duties. Ms. Coupal alleged that as a result of a partial disability and her age, she was not able to participate in UFT. She complained that CBSA restricted her work duties as a result of her inability to complete the training, and this in turn resulted in a loss of employment opportunities.\n[3] Ms. Milinkovich was a successful candidate for a BSO position at the CBSA International Mail Operations in Toronto. She alleged that CBSA prevented her from taking a position as a BSO because it assumed that her physical restrictions would not permit her to complete the UFT.\n[4] At issue in both complaints is whether CBSA\u2019s Use of Force Training (UFT) Policy for BSOs discriminates against the Complainants on the basis of their disability or age, contrary to s. 7 of the Act. Ms. Coupal\u2019s complaint includes the additional allegation that the UFT requirement deprives or tends to deprive her or a class of individuals of an employment opportunity on the basis of their disability and\/or age, contrary to s. 10 of the Act.\n[5] PSAC wishes to be added as a complainant in order to address the allegations regarding systemic discrimination in Ms. Coupal\u2019s s. 10 complaint, and to seek an appropriate remedy on behalf of all Border Service Officers in the event that the complaints are substantiated.\n[6] The Complainants consent to the motion.\n[7] CBSA opposes the motion to add PSAC as a party arguing that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to add PSAC as a complainant and, in the alternative, that PSAC has not met the test for adding a party.\n[8] The Tribunal has jurisdiction under s. 48.9(2)(b) of the Act to add parties to existing proceedings. In the majority of cases, this jurisdiction has been exercised to add respondents rather than complainants.\n[9] It has been said that adding parties should be done with caution and only after careful consideration of a number of factors. These factors include: whether the addition of the party is necessary to resolve the complaint; whether it could not reasonably have been foreseen that the new party should have been added when the complaint was filed; and, whether the addition of a party will result in serious prejudice to the opposing party (See for example: Brown v. National Capital Commission, 2003 CHRT 43 ; Wade v. Canada (Attorney General), 2008 CHRT 9; and, Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail v. Barbe, 2003 CHRT 24 where the Tribunal granted a motion to add a complainant. See also : Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone v. TELUS Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc. 2003 CHRT 31 at para. 30; and, Smith v. CNR 2005 CHRT 23 at para. 52).\n[10] In the present case, PSAC contends that its participation as a complainant is necessary since only PSAC can provide the information that would assist the Tribunal to fashion an appropriate remedy in the event that the s. 10 complaint is substantiated. An appropriate remedy, according to PSAC, would be one that applies to all of the BSOs across Canada. BSOs perform extremely diverse functions across the country in approximately 12,000 Points-of-Entry across Canada, which include land border crossings, airports, seaports, postal services and immigration detention centres.\n[11] As a result of the diversity of their work and workplaces, the nature and extent of the risks that BSOs face on the job varies greatly. So too does the need for UFT. Information about the nature and extent of the risks facing this diverse work group is needed, it is argued, to design a remedy that is not restricted to the Complainants\u2019 workplaces \u2013 the Windsor Land Border crossing and the International Mail Operations in Toronto.\n[12] Assuming, without deciding, that the scope of the complaint is broad enough to encompass a remedy for all BSO\u2019s throughout Canada who are in similar circumstances to those of the Complainants, I see no reason why the Complainants could not call a PSAC witness who could provide the information outlined above. It is not necessary to have PSAC added as a party in order to provide this information to the Tribunal.\n[13] The denial of party status to PSAC would not impede the Complainants from making arguments with respect to the appropriate systemic remedy that should be ordered in the event that the complaint is substantiated. It is noteworthy, in that regard, that PSAC appears to be working very closely with the Complainants on this matter.\n[14] This is not a case like Brown v. National Capital Commission, 2003 CHRT 43, where it was necessary to add Public Works as a respondent because without that party the appropriate remedy would be unenforceable. Nor is it similar to Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail v. Barbe, where the Tribunal added the victim of the discriminatory conduct as a complainant. In that case, it was appropriate to add Ms. Des Rosiers as a complainant in order to properly resolve a complaint that was exclusively about her.\n[15] PSAC\u2019s response to the point that Ms. Coupal is free to call a PSAC representative to testify about other BSOs is that the Respondent will likely object to this evidence on the grounds that it is irrelevant: the scope of the complaints is limited to the particular circumstances of the Complainants\u2019 workplaces and therefore, any information about other workplaces is irrelevant.\n[16] If PSAC had a concern that the scope of the complaint might not be large enough to encompass the circumstances of all BSO\u2019s working throughout Canada, then it should have raised that concern when the complaint was drafted or as soon after that as it became aware of the complaint.\n[17] As PSAC stated, it was engaged in ongoing discussions with the Respondent on the Use of Force Training issue since at least 2001.\n[18] Moreover, it appears that PSAC has been involved in the present complaints since at least the investigation stage. PSAC had the opportunity to request that it be added to the complaint if it felt this was necessary before the referral was made to the Tribunal.\n[19] This is all the more apparent when one considers that the complaint was initially dismissed by the Commission and on judicial review, it was returned to the Commission for further investigation and reconsideration. PSAC would therefore have had ample opportunity to become aware of the case and to request that it be added prior to referral.\n[20] Once the complaint has been referred to the Tribunal, the addition of a party may result in a deprivation of the benefit of certain procedural protections that are provided at the pre-referral stage. These protections include the opportunity to persuade the Commission during its investigation process, that it should refuse to deal with the complaint because, for example, the complaint is without merit or it is based on acts or omissions that occurred more than one year before the receipt of the complaint (Warman v. Lemire 2006 CHRT 48 at paras. 4-7).\n[21] PSAC argues that there is no procedural unfairness to the Respondent in circumventing the Commission process given that the Respondent has known since 2001 that PSAC had concerns about the UFT as it was applied to aging and disabled workers. PSAC\u2019s position with respect to the complaints will therefore come as no surprise to the Respondent. This may be so but this argument does not address the loss of procedural protections that may be otherwise available if PSAC is added as a complainant at this stage of the proceedings.\n[22] For all of these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that this is not an appropriate case in which to exercise its discretion under s. 48.9(2)(b) to add PSAC as a complainant to the proceedings. The motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ.

Jensen Date: June 16, 2008 Citation: 2008 CHRT 25\n[1] The Respondents, Citizenship and Immigration Canada and Canada Border Service Agency, have requested an order preventing certain evidence from being adduced at the hearing into a complaint filed by Keith Jeffers in April of 2004. The complaint involves allegations that between 2002 and 2004, Mr. Jeffers was subjected to discriminatory treatment on the basis of his race and national or ethnic origin at Pearson International Airport when he was sent for questioning regarding his citizenship.\n[2] The Respondents are requesting an order preventing the Complainant from introducing the report of Dr. Scot Wortley entitled Racial Differences in Customs Searches at Pearson International Airport as evidence in the hearing of the present matter. The Respondents are also requesting an order preventing the Complainant from introducing the report entitled Canada Customs Visible Minority Study as evidence in the hearing of this matter. The latter study was conducted by COMPAS Inc, a multi-audience research firm.\n[3] There was some uncertainty as to whether Dr. Wortley would be testifying as an expert witness at the hearing. However, that now appears to be resolved; the Commission, rather than the Complainant, intends to call Dr. Wortley as an expert witness and to introduce his report during his testimony.\n[4] The Respondents maintain, nonetheless, that Dr. Wortley\u2019s report is inadmissible for a number of reasons. These reasons include the assertion that the report is unreliable, unnecessary and irrelevant. The Respondents further assert that Dr. Wortley\u2019s report has not been accepted by a number of other tribunals and courts. Therefore, this Tribunal should rule, in advance of the hearing, that Dr. Wortley\u2019s report will not be admitted during the hearing into the present complaint.\n[5] I am of the view that the admissibility of the Wortley report is a matter that is best left for determination at the hearing. One of the criteria for the admissibility of expert evidence is that the evidence be given by a properly qualified expert. The Commission and\/or the Complainant have not yet had the opportunity to attempt to qualify Dr. Wortley. Therefore, a determination on the admissibility of the Wortley report is not possible at this time. The Respondents are free to raise their objections to the admissibility of the report at the appropriate time during the hearing.\n[6] The Respondents argue that the COMPAS report on the Canada Customs Visible Minority Study is inadmissible for the same reasons as the Wortley report and for an additional reason: the author of the study will not be testifying. Therefore, the COMPAS report will be no more than hearsay evidence of a highly prejudicial nature, and for these reasons it is inadmissible, according to the Respondents.\n[7] The Commission responds that the COMPAS report is not an expert report, but rather an internal document commissioned by one of the Respondents. The report is relevant and essential for the Tribunal to determine if racial profiling applies in this particular case, according to the Commission. It also argues that the Respondents may call evidence to rebut the material in the COMPAS report should they see fit. The Complainant has not provided any submissions on the issue.\n[8] When faced with a pre-hearing objection to the admissibility of evidence, the Tribunal\u2014as master of its own proceeding\u2014is not required to decide the objection at the pre-hearing stage, or exactly as framed. However, there are cases such as the present one, where an advance ruling would significantly assist counsel in preparing for the hearing and would promote an expeditious and fair hearing. In such cases, it is appropriate to assess the evidence as it has been proposed and determine, prior to the hearing whether its value is worth what it costs. (See Morin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2003 CHRT 46 at para. 6)\n[9] I think that the Respondents\u2019 argument in the present case with respect to the COMPAS report has merit. The Commission is seeking to have the report entered into evidence as proof of the truth of the contents. The report is hearsay evidence unless it is submitted through the testimony of the author of the study or another individual who has direct knowledge of the study and the production of the report.\n[10] Although the Tribunal may admit hearsay evidence, it is not required to do so. In determining whether to admit hearsay evidence, it is appropriate for an administrative tribunal to consider the factors of reliability and necessity (R. v. Khan [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531; Telus Communications Inc. v. Telecommunications Workers Union, 2005 FCA 262 (CanLII) at paras. 26-29). These factors must be applied in a flexible manner and with due regard to the latitude that is afforded to the Tribunal to admit evidence that would not otherwise be admissible in a court of law (s. 50(3)(c) of the CHRA; Telus, supra, at para. 28; and R. v. Hawkins [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043 at para. 68).\n[11] In the present case, the Commission has not indicated why it is necessary to introduce the evidence through someone other than the author of the COMPAS report or another individual with direct knowledge of the study and production of the report. The introduction of the report indicates that the principal investigator for the study and author of the report was Stephen Kiar, a senior partner of COMPAS. Initially, in its Statement of Particulars, the Complainant stated that it would be calling a representative of COMPAS to testify about its report. Later, in a case management conference call, the Complainant told the parties and the Tribunal that it would instead be calling the Executive Director of the African-Canadian Legal Clinic to introduce the COMPAS report. The Tribunal directed the Complainant to provide an amended Statement of Particulars including a revised list of witnesses as well as a summary of their anticipated testimony. The Complainant has not provided the requested document, nor did it provide the reason that Mr. Kiar, or another individual with direct knowledge of the study and the production of the report, could not be called as a witness. Therefore, the necessity of introducing this evidence through the Executive Director of the African-Canadian Legal Clinic has not been established.\n[12] Moreover, there are questions about the reliability and probative value of the conclusions in the COMPAS report. Two of the conclusions in the report are that Black people in Toronto tended to be subject to more delays or searches, particularly when returning from the Caribbean, and this group felt they were treated unfairly by Customs officers. However, at page 3 of the report, the author states: This research was qualitative in nature, not quantitative. As such, the results provide an indication of participants\u2019 views about the issues explored, but cannot be generalized to the full population of visible minority travelers. At page 6 of the report, the author states that readers should not view this research as statistically representative of visible minority travelers.\n[13] Does this mean that the conclusions provided in the report such as the ones set out above cannot reliably be applied to the case at hand? If that is the case, then the probative value of the COMPAS report may be minimal. Moreover, given that the conclusions are central to the inquiry in this case and are prejudicial to the Respondents\u2019 case, it would be unfair to admit the evidence without providing the Respondents with an opportunity to cross-examine the author or another individual with direct knowledge about the study and the report about the statements.\n[14] For these reasons, the COMPAS report shall not be admitted into evidence through the testimony of a representative of the African-Canadian Legal Clinic. This order is without prejudice to the right of the Commission or the Complainant to request that the report be admitted through another witness.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

(SCO), an umbrella organization made up of 36 southern Manitoba First Nations communities.\n[2] Ms. Keeper-Anderson is a First Nations woman from the Fisher River First Nations and is the mother of seven children. She has a Bachelor of Arts degree and several years experience working with First Nations in southern Manitoba.\n[3] Ms. Keeper-Anderson was first hired by SCO in May 2001 as a researcher for the Framework Agreement Initiative\/Child and Family Services Table. She worked as a researcher until November 27 , 2001, when she became SCO\/CFS project manager.\n[4] The FAI is a master contribution agreement between Canada and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC). Under the FAI, the AMC has signed a sub-agreement with the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO) to coordinate the CFS program on behalf of all the First Nations in Manitoba. MKO signed a sub-sub-agreement with SCO to coordinate the CFS program for the First Nations in southern Manitoba.\n[5] The AMC\/MKO agreement requires MKO to provide progress and financial reports to the AMC Executive on the CFS work plan activities in accordance with a reporting date schedule. The reports must meet this schedule for the funding to flow from Canada to the AMC and then to MKO and SCO.\n[6] The project which Ms. Keeper-Anderson managed involved meeting with each of the First Nations communities in southern Manitoba to interview and collect information from the elders and from others in the communities regarding traditional child rearing.\n[7] After the information was gathered, it was to be translated from Cree and Ojibway to English and compiled into a Consolidated Report to be presented to the AMC and MKO and used for negotiating a self-government agreement on Child and Family Services with the federal government.\n[8] On February 12, 2004, Ms. Keeper-Anderson left SCO. She purported to go on sick leave because of complications with her pregnancy and thereafter on maternity and parental leave. Ms. Keeper-Anderson claims that she had every intention of returning to SCO after her leave was over.\n[9] The SCO's position is otherwise: SCO says that Ms. Keeper-Anderson never requested or received authorization to take sick or maternity leave as required under the SCO's employment policy. And says SCO, just prior to leaving in February 2004, she told some staff members that she quit. The SCO claims that Ms. Keeper-Anderson resigned her position on February 12, 2004.\nA. Ms. Keeper-Anderson's Human Rights Complaint [10] Ms. Keeper-Anderson's human rights complaint is two-fold. First, she claims that SCO has failed to provide a harassment-free workplace. Secondly, she claims that SCO wrongfully terminated her employment and treated her negatively during her employment. For these two allegations of discrimination, she relies on sex (pregnancy) as the prohibited ground. Her complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission is dated October 13, 2004.\nII. FACTS A. The Alleged Harassment (i) The First Incident - SCO Golf Tournament Dinner - September 2002 [11] In September 2002, SCO held a golf tournament at the Kingswood Golf & Country Club Ltd. in La Salle, Manitoba. Approximately 75 people were in attendance, including Chiefs and Council, business partners and SCO staff.\n[12] It was Ms. Keeper-Anderson's birthday and a male prankster, a Rent-A-Nerd was hired to attend the golf tournament dinner as a surprise for her birthday.\n[13] Ms. Keeper-Anderson testified that without her knowledge or permission, the Rent-A-Nerd was given personal information about her. In her view, the Rent-A-Nerd used this information to publicly humiliate her. She said he joked about the large number of children she has, the fact that she breast-fed all her children, and the size of her breasts.\n[14] After the golf tournament dinner was over, Ms. Keeper-Anderson said that she told Elva McCorrister, SCO Executive Director, that she was very uncomfortable with the Rent-A-Nerd's comments about her. She kept her personal life very private from her professional life and felt it was inappropriate to make that kind of information public.\n[15] Ms. Keeper-Anderson spoke to her supervisor, Stuart Wuttke, immediately after the incident and told him how upset she was. She also told Bethany Ettawacappo and Eileen Doerksen, two SCO staff who were seated at her table, that she was embarrassed by the conduct of the Rent-A-Nerd.\n[16] She did not file any formal complaint with Mr. Wuttke or with Ms. McCorrister.\n[17] Later, Ms. Keeper-Anderson learned that Donna Hall, an administrative assistant at SCO, was the one who had given the information to the Rent-a-Nerd.\n[18] Ms. McCollister said that prior to the dinner, it was vaguely mentioned to her that an act or a comedian would be performing at the golf tournament dinner. She did not know it would be a Rent-A-Nerd.\n[19] Ms. McCorrister did not recall Ms. Keeper-Anderson voicing her complaint at the dinner. The next morning, she met with her staff, told them she did not authorize this, and refused to authorize SCO payment for the Rent-A-Nerd.\n(ii) The Second Incident -The October 2003 Meeting [20] Ms. Keeper-Anderson alleges that shortly after she advised SCO in October 2003 that she was pregnant, Grand Chief Margaret Swan, Elva McCorrister, and Stuart Wuttke had a meeting. Ms. Keeper-Anderson was not at the meeting. But she testified that during the meeting, those three discussed the fact of her pregnancy and Chief Margaret Swan told Mr. Wuttke to get rid of Loretta because she's pregnant. Ms. Keeper-Anderson said that Mr. Wuttke told her that he was to fire her, but he refused because he did not have a good reason for doing so.\n[21] Chief Swan did not remember this meeting. But she did remember having meetings with Ms. McCorrister about Ms. Keeper-Anderson's work performance. As to Ms. Keeper-Anderson's allegation that she wanted Ms. Keeper-Anderson fired because she was pregnant, Chief Swan said this was ludicrous.\n[22] Chief Swan has seven children, is a single parent, and worked during all of her pregnancies. She believed that she was more lenient with Ms. Keeper-Anderson because she was pregnant and a single parent.\n[23] Ms. McCorrister's recollection was that Chief Swan had called this meeting. She was not happy with the progress of CFS program. There had been a recent SCO summit and Ms. Keeper-Anderson was one of the presenters. Her presentation did not go well and the chiefs had a number of complaints about her.\n[24] Chief Swan was upset about this. She was responsible to the chiefs for the CFS project and she wanted it done well. In any case, Ms. Keeper-Anderson was not terminated and continued to work as the project manager.\n(iii) The Third Incident - December 2003 Christmas Party [25] In December 2003, SCO held their annual Christmas party at the Royal Crown Restaurant in Winnipeg. At the time, Ms. Keeper-Anderson was four months pregnant. It was Chief Swan's practice at the Christmas party to ask each employee to come to the front and she would present them with a Christmas gift.\n[26] When Ms. Keeper-Anderson went up to the front, she said that Chief Swan commented, I'm surprised you haven't had a miscarriage yet with all the pressure we've put you under this year at Southern Chiefs. Ms. Keeper-Anderson said that she was visibly upset by Chief Swan's comment.\n[27] Ms. McCorrister said that it was the practice of Chief Swan to make a comment to each of the staff when they were called up to receive their gift. Ms. McCorrister could not recall Ms. Keeper-Anderson approaching her to complain about Chief Swan's comment at the Christmas dinner. Nor did Ms. Keeper-Anderson ever put any complaint in writing.\n[28] Chief Swan did not recall exactly what she said to Ms. Keeper-Anderson, but may have said something like she was surprised Ms. Keeper-Anderson didn't have a miscarriage because of all the stress everyone at SCO was experiencing.\n[29] But she did not intend her comment to be derogatory or insulting. When she would give a gift a staff member, she would say good things or sometimes funny things about them. Things to make them feel good, not bad. She made a personalized comment to each employee. She did not single out Ms. Keeper-Anderson.\n[30] Ms. Keeper-Anderson never told Chief Swan that she was offended by her comment. If she had, Chief Swan said, she would have apologized.\n(iv) The Fourth Incident - Del Assiniboine's Queries re: Ms. Keeper-Anderson's Maternity Leave - January\/February 2004 [31] Elva McCorrister went on sick leave in January 2004. Del Assiniboine took her place as the Acting Executive Director. Ms. Keeper-Anderson claims that on at least three separate occasions in January\/February 2004, Mr. Assiniboine initiated discussions with her regarding the specific dates of when she planned to take maternity leave, when she would return to work, and if she was going to recommend someone to replace her while she was gone.\n[32] She assured Mr. Assiniboine that she would give SCO adequate notice before she went on maternity leave. She recommended Jeff LaPlante, a policy analyst who worked with her on the project and who could continue the work without interruption.\n[33] Ms. Keeper-Anderson claimed that her assurances did not satisfy Mr. Assiniboine's concerns. She felt that she was being harassed by Mr. Assiniboine by his questioning as to when she planned to take her maternity leave.\n[34] Mr. Assiniboine's usual position at SCO was health advocate. He explained that in the Indian world, they are always concerned with their babies, born or unborn and as they are growing up until they become adults.\n[35] He would always make a point of visiting not only Ms. Keeper-Anderson, but all the staff in the office, when he came in. He would spend a few minutes in each of their offices talking to them. That was the context within which, he says, he would ask Ms. Keeper-Anderson how she was feeling, if she was doing well and when she planned to take maternity leave.\nB. Probationary Status [36] Ms. Keeper-Anderson received a letter dated December 2, 2002, from Stuart Wuttke stating that he was placing her on probationary status from December 2, 2002 to March 31, 2003. He set out a number of reasons for doing so. These included her unsatisfactory performance at the November 27-28, 2002 SCO summit, when delivering her oral report; her failure to provide timely budget updates and quarterly and annual reports for the CFS project; her failure to attend regularly monthly meetings of the CFS directors for southern Manitoba; her lack of involvement at the FAI\/CFS internal and joint meetings; and her failure to act as a manager and her inability to direct staff. Her lack of management of the program and failure of her team to produce quality work had raised serious concerns about the viability of the project.\n[37] Mr. Wuttke placed certain conditions on her probationary status, which included requiring her to attend CFS directors meetings as outlined, provide a supplementary report on the status of the CFS project and complete all community reports and the Consolidated Report by March 30, 2003.\n[38] Interestingly, another of the conditions was that Ms. Keeper-Anderson must attend her law school classes to a maximum of 1.5 days per week. Ms. Keeper-Anderson found this condition very confusing because Mr. Wuttke was telling her that she was not keeping up with her work, and yet requiring her to attend 1.5 days a week at to law school.\n[39] At this time in 2002, Ms. Keeper-Anderson was attending law school part-time and working at SCO. Mr. Wuttke had encouraged her to go to law school and he had assured her that she would be assisted with her job responsibilities.\n[40] She missed some meetings because she was at law school. She was not being helped with her job. She was also getting criticism from upper management about not getting her work done.\n[41] On occasion, Mr. Wuttke would call her and tell her about an important meeting that she had to attend. This began to happen with more frequency and she missed a lot of classes. So she withdrew from law school, did not finish the first term and came back to work full-time.\n[42] Ms. Keeper-Anderson refused to sign the letter acknowledging the terms of her probationary status. She said that she discussed the letter with Mr. Wuttke and told him that there were conflicting requirements within the letter. His response was that the letter came from higher authority and he was required to write it.\n[43] Ms. Keeper-Anderson testified that she spoke to Ms. McCorrister about her probationary status and that she wanted to appeal it. According to Ms. Keeper-Anderson, Ms. McCorrister said that she did not need to write a letter and to disregard Mr. Wuttke's letter. Ms. Keeper-Anderson asked Ms. McCorrister what she meant by that and Ms. McCorrister told her that she would not be placed on probationary status.\n[44] Nonetheless, Ms. Keeper-Anderson wrote to Ms. McCorrister on December 5, 2002, informing her, as per their conversation, that she would be submitting an appeal in writing regarding her probationary status by January 15, 2003. Ms. Keeper-Anderson did not follow up and never submitted an appeal.\n[45] In her evidence, Ms. Keeper-Anderson also addressed the timelines imposed by Mr. Wuttke. She said that during this time, the project staff consisted of only herself and one other person. Ms. Keeper-Anderson spoke on numerous occasions to Mr. Wuttke and Ms. McCorrister about the problems she was having to completing the reports. She had to send the reports back to each community to each of the persons interviewed for their review. The information gathered from the communities was in Ojibway or Cree and had to be translated into English.\n[46] Eventually the project did hire three translators a few months after Mr. Wuttke's letter. The Consolidated Report was completed in July 2003 and the community reports were done earlier.\n[47] It is noteworthy that on January 29, 2003, shortly after she was put on probationary status, Dave Rundle, the Executive Director of the Anishinaabe Child and Family Services for the three First Nations communities in the southern Manitoba, wrote to Marlyn Bennett, Research Coordinator, First Nations Research Site on January 23, 2003.\n[48] In his letter, Mr. Rundle recommended Ms. Keeper-Anderson for the position of Lead Researcher for the Children and Disabilities in Canada Research Project. He described Ms. Keeper-Anderson as the Project Manager for the FAI\/CFS Project at SCO. He noted that one of her primary duties was to carry out community consultations within the Southern First Nations communities which Ms. Keeper-Anderson had successfully completed.\n[49] Ms. McCorrister also wrote to Marlyn Bennett on January 21, 2003, recommending Ms. Keeper-Anderson for this position. She also noted that Ms. Keeper-Anderson had successfully completed the Community Consultation for the CFS\/FAI for the First Nations in southern Manitoba.\nC. Ms. Keeper-Anderson Leaves the SCO [50] Wednesday, February 11, 2004, was a regular payday. Ms. Keeper-Anderson did not receive hers. She phoned Mr. Assiniboine on February 12, 2004, and asked him why she had not been paid. She said his response was that he was justified in holding back her pay because he did a review of her personnel file and noticed that she was placed on probationary status in December 2002.\n[51] Mr. Assiniboine's version is somewhat different. He said that he explained to Ms. Keeper-Anderson that SCO did not have enough money at that time to pay all the staff. SCO had not received its funding from MKO. MKO couldn't access funding through the AMC because SCO had not provided its reports on a time.\n[52] As Acting Executive Director, he decided that senior management would not be paid and any money SCO had in the bank would be used to pay the administrative assistants. Those not responsible for reports or finances would be paid first.\n[53] He was not paid on that day, nor was Chief Swan or Ms. McCorrister. However, Mr. Assiniboine was able to arrange an extension to SCO's line of credit and everyone was paid on February 13, 2004, including Ms. Keeper-Anderson.\n[54] Mr. Assiniboine's version of their discussion about her probationary status also differs considerably from that of Ms. Keeper-Anderson. He testified that Steve Clark, Executive Director of MKO had raised concerns at a meeting with SCO on February 9, 2004, about Ms. Keeper-Anderson's failure to submit reports on a timely basis and her lack of participation at CFS committee meetings.\n[55] After the meeting, Mr. Assiniboine reviewed Ms. Keeper-Anderson's personnel file and noticed that she had previously been placed on probationary status for many of the same reasons as expressed by Mr. Clark. He also noted that Ms. Keeper-Anderson had not attended a February 11, 2004 meeting when requested to do so by Chief Swan because she said she was too busy.\n[56] During their telephone conversation, Mr. Assiniboine said that he raised these concerns with Ms. Keeper-Anderson and told her that he was considering putting her on probationary status again or taking some sort disciplinary action. This had nothing to do with her not getting paid. Her response was, that's it, I'm out of here.\n[57] Ms. Keeper-Anderson did agree that she said to Mr. Assiniboine at the end of their telephone conversation, I'm out of here. But she did not say that she quit.\n[58] Mr. Assiniboine also testified that on February 13, 2004, he spoke to Gladys Cochrane who told him that Ms. Keeper-Anderson had handed in her keys, cell phone and said, I quit.\n[59] On February 16, 2004, Mr. Assiniboine wrote to Ms. Keeper-Anderson that she has been away from work without her supervisor's permission. This could be considered an abandonment of employment should she continue to stay away without authorization.\n[60] He enclosed a copy of SCO Personnel Policy Manual so that she could follow the proper procedures to request leave. He also wrote that if she does not respond by March 1, 2004, he would consider that she has abandoned her position and he would take the necessary action to hire someone to fill the position.\n[61] Mr. Assiniboine was not sure whether this letter was sent to Ms. Keeper-Anderson. She said that she never received it.\n[62] When Ms. McCorrister returned from her sick leave, she learned that Ms. Keeper-Anderson was not working at SCO. She said that Ms. Cochrane told her that, on February 12, 2004, Ms. Keeper-Anderson had handed in her keys and her cell phone on and said that she quit.\n[63] Ms. Cochrane gave Ms. McCorrister the February 12, 2004 memorandum she had prepared at the time. In this memorandum, Ms. Cochrane recorded that Ms. Keeper-Anderson had handed in her keys to SCO offices, her parking pass and her cell phone and chargers. There was no mention in her memorandum that Ms. Keeper-Anderson told her that she quit. Ms. Keeper-Anderson denied that she said this to Ms. Cochrane.\n[64] Ms. McCorrister also testified that at a farewell luncheon on February 13, 2004 for other employees leaving SCO, Ms. Keeper-Anderson approached her and they hugged. When Ms. McCorrister asked her how she was doing, she replied, you know I quit. Didn't you hear I quit?\n[65] On March 22, 2004, Ms. McCorrister wrote to Ms. Keeper-Anderson that SCO had not heard anything from her since she handed in her keys and cell phone to Gladys Cochrane on February 12, 2004. She referred to SCO's leave policy and procedures and noted that Ms. Keeper-Anderson never made a formal request for sick or maternity leave, either orally or in writing. She concluded that SCO has assumed that she has abandoned her position and SCO will be filling it in the near future. It is very puzzling that in her letter, Ms. McCorrister made no mention of the fact that Ms. Keeper-Anderson had told her more than a month earlier that she had quit.\n[66] Ms. McCorrister explained that every SCO employee goes through orientation. They are given a copy of SCO Personnel and Policies Manual which has the policies and procedures for sick leave, maternity leave, and parental leave.\n[67] Sick leave for more than three days must be supported by a doctor's certificate given to the Executive Director. For maternity leave, the employee must notify the Executive Director at least four weeks before the leave is to commence which can not start earlier than 11 weeks before delivery. The employee must also provide a doctor's certificate confirming the pregnancy and the estimated delivery date.\n[68] The employee must make a request in writing to the Executive Director for parental leave at least four weeks before the leave is to start. When leaving SCO, the employee must return their cell phone, their office keys, and any other equipment that belongs to SCO.\n[69] Ms. Keeper-Anderson's telling of the events is that she went on sick leave on February 12, 2004. Before she left on that day, she handed in her office keys, her cell phone and parking pass to Gladys Cochrane, SCO Office Manager.\n[70] Ms. Keeper-Anderson agreed that she did not make any formal request for sick or maternity or parental leave. Part of the reason for not doing so was because of the comments Chief Swan had made at the Christmas party. She took those words literally and felt she was being pressured. She did not want to tell them that she had complications with her pregnancy and have it used against her.\n[71] Ms. Keeper-Anderson did get a medical certificate dated February 13, 2004, from her doctor which indicated that Ms. Keeper-Anderson was unable to work due to illness and pregnancy. Ms. Keeper-Anderson had spoken to someone at the Employment Insurance office who told her that if she wanted to claim EI sick leave and maternity benefits, she had to obtain a doctor's certificate and a Record of Employment (ROE).\n[72] She met with Bethany Ettawacappo, SCO Financial Officer at the time and submitted the medical certificate to her. She asked Ms. Ettawacappo to prepare an ROE and told her that she would be returning to SCO after her leave was finished.\n[73] Ms. Ettawacappo prepared the ROE dated February 13, 2004. In the Comments section of the ROE, she wrote, 16 - employee on sick leave February 16\/04- May 12\/04, maternity incl. parental leave May 13\/04 to May 13\/05.\n[74] Ms. Ettawacappo testified that she was the person who prepared the ROEs. She also said that she had never been told that the ROE had to be approved by management. During her time at SCO, she only issued three ROEs and this was the first for sick leave. Ms. Ettawacappo was not aware that SCO had a Personnel Manual. So she was not aware that when an employee wanted to take leave, they had to make a written request. She did say, however, that an employee would probably have to, that would be assumed.\n[75] Ms. Ettawacappo did not tell Mr. Assiniboine that she had issued an ROE for Ms. Keeper-Anderson. She did not speak with Ms. McCorrister about this because she left SCO on February 24, 2004, before Ms. McCorrister returned to work.\n[76] Ms. Keeper-Anderson submitted the ROE and medical certificate to EI and applied for sick leave benefits and maternity benefits. Her application was approved on March 8, 2004, effective February 15, 2004, for sickness benefits to May 4, 2004, and subsequently for 50 weeks of maternity and parental leave benefits.\n[77] As to Ms. McCorrister's March 22, 2004 letter, stating that she had abandoned her position, Ms. Keeper-Anderson's response was that she had taken the proper procedures to let SCO know that she was going on leave, as per her discussion with Ms. Ettawacappo.\n[78] She did not abandon her position with SCO. It was evident from the ROE that she would be returning. She did not request holiday or vacation pay because she had every intention of returning to SCO. She also denied that she told Ms. Cochrane that she was quitting.\n[79] Ms. Keeper-Anderson did not discuss the ROE with Mr. Wuttke, her supervisor, or contact him after February 13, 2004, to tell him that she had left on sick leave.\nD. The Second ROE [80] Ms. Keeper-Anderson received a letter from Ms. McCorrister dated August 24, 2004, advising her that SCO had issued a new ROE because the February 13, 2004 ROE was incorrect. Now the comment section of the new ROE read, E Quit - not returning.\n[81] SCO did not discover the February 13, 2004 ROE, until it was found under a pile of papers in August 2004 by the new finance officer when she was cleaning up the office. SCO was alerted that a ROE had been issued when the EI office called about Ms. Keeper-Anderson's benefits.\n[82] Ms. McCorrister explained that SCO had obtained legal advice that the first ROE was completed without SCO management authority by Ms. Ettawacappo on information supplied by Ms. Keeper-Anderson herself. SCO was advised to issue a new ROE that accurately reflected the facts.\n[83] According to Ms. McCorrister, SCO would issue a ROE when a manager or the executive director informed the finance officer that an employee was leaving SCO. The finance officer would then have the authority to issue an ROE setting out the reason why the employee is leaving.\nE. Legal Proceedings [84] After Ms. Keeper-Anderson received Ms. McCorrister's March 22, 2004 letter, on March 29, 2004, she telephoned Ms. McCorrister and told her that she had not abandoned her position, that she planned to return to work as soon as possible, and that she did not take holiday pay because she had every intention of returning to work after her maternity leave was over.\n[85] According to Ms. Keeper-Anderson, Ms. McCorrister said that she would not reconsider her decision. Ms. Keeper-Anderson then retained a lawyer who wrote to SCO on June 28, 2004. Her lawyer asserted that, contrary to the SCO's position, Ms. Keeper-Anderson had not abandoned her job. Rather, she was on sick leave with respect to complications arising from her pregnancy and this was clearly set out in the February 13, 2004 ROE. Her lawyer asked that, in accordance with the Employment Standards Code, Ms. Keeper-Anderson be reinstated at the end of her maternity leave.\n[86] SCO responded on August 19, 2004, in a letter from its legal counsel. SCO's position was that its internal investigation confirmed that Ms. Keeper-Anderson did in fact resign from her position on February 12, 2004.\n[87] Examples in support of this conclusion were her telephone conversation with Mr. Assiniboine on February 12, 2004, in which Ms. Keeper-Anderson said, That's it. I'm out of here, and hung up the phone.\n[88] And after she had talked to Mr. Assiniboine, she went to Gladys Cochrane's office and handed in her keys and cell phone, said that she quit and left the office without further explanation.\n[89] Ms. Keeper-Anderson's lawyer replied on August 25, 2004, saying that she was reviewing the issues raised in the SCO's letter. Nothing resulted from this exchange of letters between the lawyers and Ms. Keeper-Anderson did not pursue any further legal action.\nIII. REASONS FOR DECISION A. Harassment - S. 14 of the CHRA [90] For some time, there has been indications in the jurisprudence that the gender component of harassment is broad enough to encompass all unwelcome conduct targeting the victim's gender which poisons the work environment.\n[91] The main conceptual structure for harassment under s. 14 of the CHRA was first enacted by the Supreme Court in Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252. There the Court said that the test for sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that poisons the work environment.\n[92] This test was further elaborated by the Federal Court in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces), [1999] 3 F.C. 653 (Franke). In Franke, the Court pointed out that the conduct or comments must be sexual in nature or gender-based. The range of conduct which would qualify for harassment includes gender-based insults, sexist remarks, or comments about a person's look or appearance. It would also include jokes or comments that cause awkwardness or embarrassment.\n[93] The conduct must be unwelcome. What must be examined is the response or reaction of the complainant at the time of the incident. Did the complainant expressly or by her behavior show that the conduct was unwelcome. Did the complainant notify the employer of the alleged unwelcome conduct. If the conduct was sexual in nature or gender related and shown to be unwelcome, there must be further inquiry, namely, whether the conduct resulted in a poisoned work environment.\n[94] This will depend on the persistence or seriousness of the conduct. In Franke, the Court considered that the more serious the conduct, the less repetition is necessary to establish harassment. The less serious, the more persistence must be demonstrated. The Court also pointed that, when determining whether the conduct falls within the ambit of sexual in nature or whether it is sufficiently severe or persistent to create a poisoned workplace, the reasonable person standard applies.\n[95] Ms. Keeper-Anderson relies on four incidents to demonstrate a breach of s. 14. It is not clear whether Ms. Keeper-Anderson considers the pay cheque incident to be harassment or adverse differentiation. In my opinion, it does not matter how it is characterized. As will be seen, I conclude that it is neither.\n[96] Consider then the four alleged incidents of harassment. It is clear that the Rent-A-Nerd comments as reported by Ms. Keeper-Anderson were gender-based. They referenced the number of her children, that she was breastfeeding and the size of her breasts.\n[97] At the dinner, Ms. Keeper-Anderson told both SCO executive director and her supervisor that she was upset and embarrassed by the comments. That the comments crossed the boundary of her professional and private life and were unwelcome.\n[98] But I am not persuaded that the conduct of the Rent-A-Nerd was so serious and\/or persistent as to create a poisoned work environment for Ms. Keeper-Anderson. They may have been embarrassing or upsetting for Ms. Keeper-Anderson. It was an isolated incident. The presence of the Rent-a Nerd was nothing more than a transient event. It did not become an enduring feature of Ms. Keeper-Anderson's employment experience. Nor is there any evidence that it negatively altered her working conditions at SCO.\n[99] I characterize the same way the remarks made by Chief Swan at the December 2003 Christmas party. They were gender-based to the extent that they referred to Ms. Keeper-Anderson's pregnancy. Ms. Keeper-Anderson said that she was upset by this. But both Ms. McCorrister and Chief Swan testified that Ms. Keeper-Anderson never told them that she was offended by the Chief's comments.\n[100] Again it was a one-off incident. It occurred more than a year after the Rent-a Nerd. Chief Swan testified that she did not single out Ms. Keeper-Anderson. It is very difficult to conclude that this had the effect of poisoning Ms. Keeper-Anderson's workplace environment.\n[101] As to the October 2003 meeting, Ms. Keeper-Anderson was not present. She did not say how she learned that Chief Swan wanted her fired because she was pregnant. The only evidence is that Mr. Wuttke told her that he was to fire her but refused because there was no reason to do so. Ms. Keeper-Anderson was not terminated. She continued to work at SCO.\n[102] Finally, there is the allegation that Mr. Assiniboine repeatedly asked her, during January\/February 2004, when she would be taking maternity leave. Mr. Assiniboine's evidence was that as the SCO health advocate, he had a genuine interest in Ms. Keeper-Anderson's well being. And as acting executive director, he would have to know when Ms. Keeper-Anderson would be taking maternity leave and plan accordingly for the project. I fail to see how these inquiries could be characterized as gender-based harassment.\n[103] A final consideration is that these incidents were unrelated, isolated, and occurred over the period from September 2002 to January 2004. They were certainly not persistent.\n[104] I have concluded that a reasonable person would not, in these circumstances, consider that these incidents were sufficiently serious or repetitive as to poison Ms. Keeper-Anderson's work environment. Ms. Keeper-Anderson has not established a contravention to s. 14 of the CHRA.\n[105] Ms. Keeper-Anderson referred to telephone conversation that she had with Mr. Assiniboine on February 12, 2004. She claims that Mr. Assiniboine told her that she had not received her pay cheque because she had been placed on probationary status in December 2002.\n[106] It is not clear whether Ms. Keeper-Anderson is alleging harassment or adverse differentiation. In my view, given the facts, it is neither. I accept Mr. Assiniboine's evidence that the reason why Ms. Keeper-Anderson was not paid on this day was that SCO did not have the funds to do so.\n[107] Other SCO staffs including Chief Swan, Ms. McCorrister and Mr. Assiniboine were not paid. Ms. Keeper-Anderson was not singled out on this occasion. And she was paid two days later, as were the others.\nB. Termination of Her Employment - S. 7 of the CHRA [108] Dealing now with the termination of her employment, Ms. Keeper-Anderson has established a prima facie case of discrimination under s. 7(a) of the CHRA. But for her pregnancy and the sickness related to the pregnancy, she would not have absented herself from the workplace; but for her absence from the workplace, SCO would not have formed the opinion that she had abandoned her job. The conclusion of abandonment led to the refusal to continue to employ.\n[109] SCO now has the burden of providing a reasonable, non-discriminatory explanation for its conduct. SCO initially took the position that Ms. Keeper-Anderson had abandoned her employment. However, this position became untenable on March 29, 2004 when Ms. Keeper-Anderson called in to say, quite unequivocally, that she had not resigned her position and was planning to come back.\n[110] This is when the true refusal to continue to employ occurred. At this point, SCO's position was based, not on any theory of abandonment, but apparently on Ms. Keeper-Anderson's previous failure to provide advance notice of - and obtain advance authorization for - her absence from the workplace. Moreover, it would appear that the refusal was also based on the effluxion of time, a lapse of over two months.\n[111] Viewed from the perspective of March 29, 2004, is reliance on Ms. Keeper-Anderson's earlier breach of the leave policy a reasonable explanation for no longer employing her? I do not think so for these reasons:\nat the time SCO refused to reconsider its decision, it knew of Ms. Keeper-Anderson's true intent, i.e. to return to work after her pregnancy-related leave; for a significant amount of time prior to March 29, 2004, SCO knew that Ms. Keeper-Anderson was pregnant and would be seeking maternity leave in the near future.\n[112] SCO made no attempt to establish that timely compliance with the leave policies was a bona fide occupational requirement. Therefore the only avenue available to rebut the prima facie case is to demonstrate that its employment refusal was unconnected with Ms. Keeper-Anderson's pregnancy. This, it has been unable to do.\n[113] Its position from March 29, 2004 onward amounted to a refusal to retroactively grant the complainant leave related to the birth of her child. Again, while such a refusal may have been completely justifiable on the grounds of undue hardship - given the lapse of time and the possibility that someone new may have already been hired - no such justification was alleged in this case.\n[114] By the same token, SCO did not attempt to justify its actions on the grounds that Ms. Keeper-Anderson's somewhat surreptitious means of obtaining a ROE without going through proper channels revealed dishonesty incompatible with the maintenance of the employment relationship.\n[115] What is left is the fact that SCO, in refusing to reconsider its conclusion of abandonment, did so in full knowledge of the pregnancy-related reasons for the complainant's absence, and her intention to return to work as soon as possible. In these circumstances, its refusal to continue to employ her was based, at least in part, on the prohibited ground of sex. Therefore, this aspect of the complaint has been substantiated.\nIV. REMEDY [116] Ms. Keeper-Anderson requested that the Tribunal award:\nlost income for the period May 2005 to May 2007 being $90,000 at $45,000\/annum; lost of benefits of $5,000; $5,000 for pain and suffering; $15,000 as damages for the willful and reckless conduct of SCO; costs incurred in selling her house; legal costs; interest on the above amounts.\n[117] Before I can decide what Ms. Keeper-Anderson should receive by way of remedy, I need to know the total income received from all sources by Ms. Keeper-Anderson from May 2005 to May 2007, and whether she is required to reimburse EI for EI benefits or any other government agency for income assistance benefits which she received in that period.\n[118] Ms. Keeper-Anderson is also to provide any legal accounts showing the legal costs she incurred relating to her complaint.\n[119] Ms. Keeper-Anderson is to provide the Tribunal and SCO counsel with this information by July 15, 2008. In the meantime, I urge the parties to try and agree on compensation for Ms. Keeper-Anderson.\n[120] I remain seized of this complaint until the question of remedy is finalized.\nSigned by\nJ.

INTRODUCTION [1] On January 19, 2004, Brigitte Lavoie (Ms. Lavoie) filed a complaint against Treasury Board of Canada (the respondent) alleging that the new Term Employment Policy (the new policy) discriminates on the basis of sex.\n[2] Ms. Lavoie alleges that paragraph 7(2)(a) of the new policy breaches sections 7, 8 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the Act), based on the fact that periods of maternity leave or parental leave without pay are not counted in calculating the cumulative three-year working period required for conversion from term employee status to indeterminate employee (permanent) status in the federal Public Service.\n[3] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) attended the hearing which was held at Ottawa on September 24, 25, 27 and 28, 2007, and from January 21 to January 25, 2008.\n[4] Based on an agreement made when the first complaint of discrimination was filed by Ms. Lavoie on July 10, 2007, the respondent contends that Ms. Lavoie cannot dispute the new policy in a personal capacity, which includes claiming relief on a personal basis. For the reasons given in the decision, I dismiss this ground of inadmissibility.\n[5] For the reasons stated below, I have determined that the respondent differentiated adversely against Ms. Lavoie in the course of employment when it refused to count the period of parental leave in determining her eligibility for an indeterminate appointment (section 7 of the Act). For the same reason, I find that the new policy deprived Ms. Lavoie of employment opportunities (section 10 of the Act).\n[6] By not counting the maternity leave or parental leave, the respondent's new policy differentiates adversely in the course of employment (section 7 of the Act) female term employees who take maternity and\/or parental leave and deprives or tends to deprive these employees of employment opportunities on the basis of their sex (section 10 of the Act).\n[7] I also order the respondent to amend the new policy in such a way as to remove the discriminatory aspects to the effect that periods of maternity leave or parental leave longer than 60 consecutive calendar days are not counted for the purposes of calculating cumulative service for an indeterminate appointment.\n[8] Accordingly, Ms. Lavoie's complaint is allowed.\nII. THE FACTS A. Evidence of the complainant, Ms. Lavoie [9] Historically, the Long Term Specified Period Employment Policy (the former policy) provided the right to convert a term appointment to an indeterminate appointment for any person in a term appointment for a five-year period. Under the former policy, leave without pay, regardless of the period of time, was taken into account in calculating the cumulative service of five years.\n[10] At the end of 2002, the respondent adopted a new term employment policy (the new policy) pursuant to which the necessary cumulative service to convert a position would thereafter be three years. This new policy excluded leave without pay of more than 60 consecutive calendar days from the calculation of cumulative service.\n[11] Pursuant to the new policy, maternity leave and parental leave are considered as leave without pay. Accordingly, the period of this leave is not taken into account in calculating the three years of cumulative service.\n[12] The new policy came into force at Industry Canada on April 1, 2003, with immediate application to term contracts already in effect. Therefore, as of April 1, 2003, for all contracts in effect, periods of leave without pay of more than 60 consecutive days were no longer counted when calculating the cumulative service of three years.\n[13] With the application of the new policy, Ms. Lavoie's parental leave, from April 1, 2003, until the end of her contract (August 5, 2003), was not counted as part of the cumulative service of three years. According to Ms. Lavoie, if the period of absence starting from April 1, 2003, had been counted, her term position would have been converted to an indeterminate appointment. Accordingly, Ms. Lavoie would have been given indeterminate employee status.\n[14] Ms. Lavoie obtained her first term employment contract on August 7, 2000, as a programmer-analyst at the Intellectual Property Office at Industry Canada. This one-year contract was successively renewed in August 2001 and August 2002, specifically beginning on August 5, 2002 until August 5, 2003, inclusively. There was no interruption of service between the two contract renewals.\n[15] During maternity leave in December 2000, the complainant was replaced in her duties by her spouse, himself a term employee hired after Ms. Lavoie.\n[16] Regarding the nature of her work at the time that she took her leave in August 2002, Ms. Lavoie declared that she performed the same work as three male indeterminate employees, one female term employee and two consultants.\n[17] At the beginning of 2002, Ms. Lavoie told her superiors that she intended to take a second maternity leave. In approximately April 2002, she was told that because of her impending absence, she would be immediately changing teams, since there had to be a person available for the project on which she was working. After indicating that she intended to file a complaint of discrimination, her superiors changed their decision, apologized for the imbroglio and advised her that she would be continuing in the same team.\n[18] On August 19, 2002, Ms. Lavoie took maternity leave ending on December 8, 2002 (17 weeks), followed by parental leave until August 19, 2003.\n[19] Initially, Ms. Lavoie undertook to return to work on March 3, 2003.\n[20] On February 21, 2003, she notified Industry Canada by e-mail that she had to extend her parental leave because she had not found anyone to take care of her child and because there was no space available at the daycare before the summer.\n[21] The same day, Sylvie Manseau, her immediate supervisor, sent the following e-mail to the complainant:\n[translation]\nAs you plan to extend your maternity leave, I must advise you that your position will not be extended beyond August 5, 2003. As you are already aware, CS-02 competitions are currently taking place for indeterminate positions and, as indicated in the e-mail that I sent to you on December 5, 2002, the terms of employees who are not appointed to one of these positions will end at the close of the competition.\n[22] At the end of the exams and interview (March, April and May 2003) in which Ms. Lavoie had participated, she was informed in May 2003 that she had finished last in the CS-02 competition, i.e. eighth where there were seven indeterminate positions. Ms. Lavoie explained that she placed eighth in the competition because of the refusal of her then-supervisor, Ms. Goulet, to allow her to participate free of charge in training on a new work method in electronic language. This training was held during her maternity leave absence. Ms. Goulet explained to her that if she wanted to benefit from this training, she had to personally assume the expense, which according to Ms. Lavoie was approximately $10,000. Ms. Lavoie could not afford this expense.\n[23] Ms. Lavoie was the only one of the eight term employees at her workplace who did not obtain an indeterminate appointment. Her husband was among the seven individuals who did obtain an indeterminate appointment.\n[24] On June 2, 2003, Marc Lalande, Supervisor, Compensation and Benefits Division, informed Ms. Lavoie that under the collective agreement, considering that she had extended her leave beyond March 3, 2003, and that her contract ending on August 5, 2003, would not be renewed, she had to reimburse Industry Canada for the maternity benefits she received pursuant to the Supplementary Unemployment Benefit Plan (SUBP), i.e. $12,897.62.\n[25] On June 11, 2003, Ms. Lavoie received a letter from Sylvie Manseau of Industry Canada, confirming that her employment would end on August 5, 2003.\n[26] On June 2, 2003, Ms. Lavoie filed a grievance contesting Industry Canada's refusal to pay her parental benefits (SUBP) for the period between January and August 2003.\n[27] On July 10, 2003, Ms. Lavoie filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against Industry Canada a complaint of discrimination on the basis of sex, based on sections 7, 10 and 14 of the Act.\n[28] On July 18, 2003, Ms. Lavoie filed a grievance contesting Industry Canada's refusal to pay her the maternity allowance retroactive adjustment (SUBP) following the salary increase negotiated between Treasury Board and her union, the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada.\n[29] On July 30, 2003, a letter signed by Mario Blais, Compensation Advisor, stated that Ms. Lavoie owed a gross amount of $12,899.42 in maternity benefit overpayments (SUBP).\n[30] During a mediation session on October 20, 2003, Ms. Lavoie and Industry Canada agreed to settle the complaint filed with the Commission on July 10, 2003. It is important to point out that at the hearing, the parties waived all immunity from disclosure in regard to the agreement.\n[31] The principal elements of this agreement are as follows:\nWithout [translation] an admission of liability in regard to the complaint, Industry Canada gave Ms. Lavoie an indeterminate appointment to begin on November 17, 2003. M s. Lavoie undertook to reimburse the benefits received under the SUBP. Ms. Lavoie acknowledged that [translation] this settlement is complete and final compensation for the alleged incidents and accordingly Industry Canada is discharged of all of the claims and causes of action resulting from the incidents in question. The grievances filed by Ms. Lavoie [translation] would follow their normal course and were not withdrawn. [translation] The complainant and her union reserve the right to file a complaint against the Treasury Board Secretariat regarding its policy entitled `Term Employment Policy'.\n[32] The Commission approved this settlement on October 27, 2003.\n[33] Ms. Lavoie began her new indeterminate employment with Industry Canada on November 17, 2003.\n[34] On January 19, 2004, Ms. Lavoie filed a new complaint before the Commission, this time against Treasury Board, alleging that the new policy was discriminatory, claiming losses resulting from the benefits of which she was allegedly deprived based on, in Ms. Lavoie's opinion, the application of the new policy.\n[35] At the hearing, Ms. Lavoie stated that during the mediation meeting, all of the remedies resulting from the application of the new policy, including her request to have the new policy abolished, had not been discussed.\n[36] Ms. Lavoie testified that the representatives of Industry Canada had never wanted to discuss all of her claims relating to the application of the new policy, so that the agreement settled only the matter of the indeterminate appointment.\n[37] At the hearing, Ms. Lavoie stated that the Industry Canada representatives in attendance at the mediation stated that her claims resulted from the application of the new policy and that only Treasury Board had the authority to address these issues.\n[38] According to Ms. Lavoie, it was in this context that it was agreed and stated in the agreement that she reserved the right to file a complaint with the Commission against Treasury Board contesting the new policy.\n[39] Following the loss of her employment in August 2002, Ms. Lavoie testified that she lived on loans. Because of these accumulated debts, she had to file for bankruptcy in 2006. The complainant separated from her spouse and sold her house. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, she reimbursed the benefits received pursuant to the SUBP.\n[40] Isabelle P\u00e9trin, Labour Relations Officer for the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, attended the mediation meeting held on October 20, 2003.\n[41] Ms. P\u00e9trin testified that at this meeting, the Industry Canada representatives had always maintained that they were not responsible for anything involving the new policy; as a result, the substance of the discrimination complaint was not discussed.\n[42] According to Ms. P\u00e9trin, the employment start date, i.e. November 17, 2003, was not negotiable from the point of view of the Industry Canada representatives.\n[43] Before closing her case, Ms. Lavoie stated that she was including the Commission's evidence in her evidence.\nB. The respondent's evidence [44] Lise S\u00e9guin testified at the hearing.\n[45] In 2002-2003, Ms. S\u00e9guin was Human Resources Director of the Intellectual Property Office at Industry Canada. At that time, Ms. S\u00e9guin was responsible for all of the complaints filed at the Commission against the department.\n[46] Ms. S\u00e9guin attended the meeting held on October 20, 2003, as a human resources advisor. At that time, she was accompanied by Agn\u00e8s Lajoie, Director of the Patent Branch at the Intellectual Property Office.\n[47] Ms. S\u00e9guin explained that Ms. Lavoie had told her story. Then each party left to confer. On returning, Agn\u00e8s Lajoie stated that they were prepared to offer a permanent position to Ms. Lavoie, namely an indeterminate appointment.\n[48] Ms. S\u00e9guin testified that the date of November 17, 2003, is explained by the fact that management had taken a gamble by increasing its resources despite the lack of operational needs, but was however anticipating the departure of one person as of November 17, 2003. It was in this context that the date of November 17, 2003, was proposed.\n[49] According to Ms. S\u00e9guin, there was no discussion regarding the new policy, apart from Ms. P\u00e9trin's alleged statement at one point that the new policy discriminated against pregnant women.\n[50] For Ms. S\u00e9guin, the new policy was not their responsibility; Industry Canada had not instigated this new policy, but rather Treasury Board.\n[51] Ms. S\u00e9guin did not wish to discuss the new policy. To the contrary, Industry Canada had to apply the new policy and it did so.\n[52] Ms. Lavoie and Ms. P\u00e9trin were the ones who asked that the agreement specify the right to file a complaint against Treasury Board. For Ms. S\u00e9guin, Ms. Lavoie had the right to complain about any policy and this was not their responsibility.\n[53] Ms. S\u00e9guin stated that she does not make it a practice to reserve compensation claims for other departments. She would not have signed an agreement of such magnitude if there had not been a waiver such as the one referred to in article 2 of the agreement.\n[54] On cross-examination, Ms. S\u00e9guin acknowledged that she could not agree on relief measures inconsistent with the application of the new policy.\n[55] Ila Murphy, Senior Project Officer with the Treasury Board Secretariat, was an active participant in developing the new policy as well as in the consultations preceding its adoption.\n[56] Ms. Murphy explained that the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) had, during the collective agreement negotiations in the autumn of 2001, requested that the number of term employees be reduced.\n[57] This is how, in November 2001, PSAC and the respondent came to agree to establish a joint committee made up representatives of PSAC and of the respondent to study the term employment situation in the Public Service of Canada.\n[58] This committee carried out research to identify the categories of persons contemplated by term employment within the Public Service and consulted various interested parties, including employees and managers.\n[59] In performing its mandate, this committee organized workshops across Canada with term employees as well as managers.\n[60] There was a survey of term employees who were PSAC members. Ms. Murphy stated that of the 1,251 term employees who responded to the survey, 71% were women.\n[61] This participation rate is representative of the percentage of women holding term appointments within the Public Service which, according to the report, was 61% at March 31, 2002. In September 2001, the average age of indeterminate employees was forty-three (43) years while the average age of term employees was thirty-seven (37) years.\n[62] The joint committee filed a report in August 2002 setting out several observations including some regarding the treatment of term employees.\n[63] One of the principal observations was the very significant insecurity felt by the majority of term employees: the inability to make plans for the future, difficulty obtaining loans and mortgages, hesitance to start a family, stress related to financial responsibilities, anxiety every year on each contract renewal.\n[64] Without amounting to a major finding, the report notes that there was sufficient mention of term employees that were not extended for maternity reasons.\n[65] As a supporting document of the report, there are the results of the 14 focus groups made up of term employees, PSAC members. The insecurities of these employees are reported, including those of some women who feared that if they were to become pregnant that their employer would let their term lapse at the earliest opportunity.\n[66] One of the principal recommendations is formulated as follows:\nTerm employees in the federal Public Service should be automatically converted to indeterminate status after two years of cumulative service, in the same department, without a break in service of more than 60 consecutive calendar days.\n[67] The report recommends progressively implementing the reduction of the period of cumulative service, namely:\nWhen the policy comes into effect, employees with three or more years of service would be converted to indeterminate appointments; One year after the policy comes into effect, employees with two or more years of service would be appointed; Thereafter, term employees would be given indeterminate appointments after accumulating the required two years of service.\n[68] Ms. Murphy explained at the hearing that one of the concerns was to avoid readjustments of the workforce within a department. Therefore, due consideration had to be given to the risk of having a surplus of indeterminate employees in a given unit, which could eventually lead to indeterminate employee dismissals. Dismissals involve costs.\n[69] The public interest and the additional burden on taxpayers were considered in developing a new policy. It had to be ensured that this new policy would not involve additional costs for the Crown.\n[70] According to Ms. Murphy, it was a matter of balancing the fair treatment of term employees and maintaining a certain operational flexibility in favour of the managers.\n[71] Then, Ms. Murphy and a colleague, Andr\u00e9 Carri\u00e8re, prepared a first draft of the policy that was the subject of a consultation with the unions, including PSAC.\n[72] This draft specifically provided for the exclusion of leave without pay in calculating cumulative service. The draft also included a change with regard to the recommendation made by the Joint Committee. Instead of the two years referred to in the report, the cumulative service provided in the draft policy was three years, without reference to a progressive implementation as the report had provided.\n[73] Ms. Murphy explained that this change in regard to the service period was due to the managers who considered that the two-year period was too short. A two-year period could create a risk that managers would be prompted to prefer hiring temporary employees. Unlike term employees, temporary employees have fewer benefits, are not unionized and do not receive merit ratings.\n[74] On December 20, 2002, the Right Honourable Lucienne Robillard, President of the Treasury Board, publicly announced the new policy, specifying in her news release that the deputy heads of the departments would have from April 1, 2003 to April 1, 2004, to implement it.\n[75] The news release summarizes the changes, including the following:\nThe threshold for term to indeterminate appointment will be three years in the same department without a break in service longer than 60 consecutive calendar days. A period of leave of absence without pay longer than 60 consecutive calendar days, while it will not constitute a break in service, will not be included in the calculation of the cumulative working period for appointment to indeterminate status.\n[76] Ms. Murphy confirmed in her testimony that the new policy did not make a distinction between the various categories of leave without pay.\n[77] Dr. Simon Langlois, a tenured professor of the sociology department at the Universit\u00e9 Laval, testified as an expert. Dr. Langlois filed a report entitled [translation] Parental leave in Canada. Sociological trend analysis.\n[78] First, Dr. Langlois painted a sociological portrait of parental leave trends, pointing out the development of an increasing number of men taking parental leave. According to Dr. Langlois, this increase in fathers taking parental leave appears to be related to the adoption of new policies in the Employment Insurance Plan improved in 2001. Dr. Langlois reported that Statistics Canada qualified the trend as a significant increase.\n[79] A survey established that men tend to take shorter leave, i.e. generally less than six months. In fact, more than two thirds returned to work in the month following the birth or adoption of the child.\n[80] The same survey indicates a willingness on the part of the parents to take longer leave when conditions are more favourable. Dr. Langlois pointed out that the adoption of the new R\u00e9gime d'assurance parentale au Qu\u00e9bec (RQAP) illustrates this trend of fathers' behaviour. In fact, men represented one third of the RQAP beneficiaries in the first year that the program came into effect. These results are higher than those recorded by Statistics Canada in all of Canada.\n[81] Recognizing that equality of men and women in terms of taking parental leave has not been [translation] perfectly achieved, Dr. Langlois determined that an increasing number of fathers will take parental leave in the future.\n[82] Second, Dr. Langlois noted an emerging trend of sharing duties and responsibilities in family matters. The responsibility traditionally assigned to mothers because of inter alia restrictive cultural norms are fading to give way to a better balance in sharing duties and responsibilities within the couple.\n[83] Dr. Langlois analyzed the statistics provided by the respondent in regard to taking more than 60 days of leave without pay among term employees in the respondent's employ. He was of the opinion that a firm conclusion could not be made in terms of the causal relationship between women taking maternity leave and parental leave and the effect of this leave on indeterminate conversion. Dr. Langlois pointed out in his report that, except for 2003-2004, the statistics do not systematically establish a disproportionate effect on female term employees. Finally, Dr. Langlois was of the opinion that the statistics did not support a conclusion regarding the effect on the number of women having access to indeterminate employment.\nC. The Commission's evidence [84] Dr. Jeffrey G. Reitz, professor of sociology at the University of Toronto, testified as an expert witness. Dr. Reitz filed a report in which he principally assessed whether the statistical data provided by the respondent at the request of the Commission revealed a prejudicial effect of the new policy on women hired for term appointments within the Public Service of Canada.\n[85] First, Dr. Reitz noted that there are more women among term employees. It is more likely that more women than men will become term employees with the Public Service of Canada. According to the statistics provided by the respondent, 59.8% were women in 2003-2004, 59.8% in 2004-2005 and 59.4% in 2005-2006.\n[86] Dr. Reitz is of the opinion that a negative impact of the new policy on women can be assessed from two perspectives:\nAre women more likely to be affected by the fact that absences longer than 60 consecutive calendar days are excluded from cumulative service? Is there a decreasing incidence of indeterminate conversion among women or can we observe that a longer period is required for women to obtain indeterminate conversion?\n[87] After analyzing the statistics provided by the respondent, Dr. Reitz determined that the new policy had a negative effect on women and created obstacles to their eligibility for indeterminate employment.\n[88] Among term employees, the numbers indicate that women tend to take leave of more than 60 consecutive days. This difference between genders is explained inter alia by maternity, but also by an increased incidence of long-term parental leave among women. Finally, the number of men taking parental leave of less than 60 days is higher than the number of women.\n[89] On the second perspective of his analysis, even though it is more difficult to assess in terms of causal relationship, Dr. Reitz observed inter alia that the percentage of women obtaining indeterminate conversion after three years was lower than expected, considering that there are more women among term employees.\n[90] Indeed, he noted that a greater percentage of women had indeterminate conversion at the end of seven years. For Dr. Reitz, this observation could be the result of the application of the new policy and indicate that taking maternity leave and\/or parental leave of more than 60 days significantly delayed a number of women in acquiring indeterminate employee status.\nIII. ISSUES [91] Does the Tribunal have the jurisdiction to hear Ms. Lavoie's complaint filed on January 19, 2004, based on the settlement made in the previous complaint?\n[92] In the affirmative, was Ms. Lavoie discriminated against on the basis of sex within the meaning of sections 7 and 10 of the Act?\n[93] Are the provisions of paragraph 7(2)(a) of the new policy discriminatory toward women on maternity leave and\/or parental leave under sections 7 and 10 of the Act?\nIV. ADMISSIBILITY OF THIS COMPLAINT [94] The respondent submitted that the complaint filed by Ms. Lavoie is inadmissible, taking into account that she waived claims to other relief in the settlement dated October 20, 2003. Specifically, the respondent contends that Ms. Lavoie compromised all aspects of this complaint against the respondent when she accepted the agreement dated October 20, 2003.\n[95] From the outset, bear in mind that on February 5, 2007, Karen A. Jensen, member of this Tribunal, decided a motion on the inadmissibility argument filed by the respondent in this matter (see: 2007 CHRT 3).\n[96] Ms. Jensen determined that the respondent's motion seeking the dismissal of the complaint on the grounds that the issues raised had been settled and would now be moot could not be granted.\n[97] Relying inter alia on sections 40 and 53 of the Act, Ms. Jensen dismissed the respondent's motion on the grounds that the Act does not require that a complaint contemplate individual relief or that the complainant be the victim of discriminatory practices.\n[98] Secondly, Ms. Jensen wrote that when the settlement was made, Ms. Lavoie reserved her right to file a complaint against the respondent Treasury Board in regard to the new policy. Ms. Jensen determined that the discriminatory nature of the new policy had therefore not been examined.\n[99] Finally, Ms. Jensen left it to this Tribunal to determine, in the event that the complaint were founded, whether Ms. Lavoie was entitled to claim relief, given the settlement reached with Industry Canada.\n[100] At this hearing, the respondent acknowledges that Ms. Lavoie may challenge the new policy. It disputes, however, her right to contest it on a personal basis, including the right to claim relief measures.\n[101] For the reasons given below, I determine that Ms. Lavoie reserved the right to challenge the new policy on a personal basis in every aspect, including that of claiming relief measures on a personal basis. It is important to refer to the principal aspects of this agreement (see: Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 C.C.R.D. No. 7, paragraph 20):\nWithout [translation] an admission of liability in regard to the complaint, Industry Canada gave Ms. Lavoie an indeterminate appointment to begin on November 17, 2003. Ms. Lavoie undertook to reimburse the benefits received under the SUBP. Ms. Lavoie acknowledged that [translation] this settlement is complete and final compensation for the alleged incidents and accordingly Industry Canada is discharged of all of the claims and causes of action resulting from the incidents in question. The grievances filed by Ms. Lavoie [translation] would follow their normal course and were not withdrawn. [translation] The complainant and her union reserve the right to file a complaint against the Treasury Board Secretariat regarding its policy entitled `Term Employment Policy'.\n[102] Note that the agreement was between the complainant and Industry Canada and that the waiver (article 2) specifically contemplates Industry Canada. Ms. Lavoie expressly reserved the right to file a complaint against the respondent Treasury Board in regard to the new policy. Ms. Lavoie did not receive any financial compensation for the alleged discriminatory aspect of the new policy.\n[103] On reading the agreement, I find that Ms. Lavoie did not waive the right to challenge the policy on a personal basis or the right to claim relief measures in the event that her complaint were allowed.\n[104] At the hearing, the parties asked me to receive testimony regarding the discussions which took place during the mediation. According to the parties, the agreement is clear on reading, but they do not interpret it the same way.\n[105] After analyzing the testimonial evidence given on this point by Ms. Lavoie and the respondent, I find that the discussions between the parties on October 20, 2003, confirm that the agreement contemplated only the settlement of the claims that were the responsibility of Industry Canada.\n[106] Ms. S\u00e9guin confirmed the testimony of Ms. Lavoie and that of Ms. P\u00e9trin to the effect that there was no discussion of the new policy because it was not their responsibility, but rather that of Treasury Board. In short, Ms. S\u00e9guin could not discuss the discrimination alleged by the complainant or the resulting relief measures. This is how the complainant came to reserve the right to challenge the new policy.\n[107] The respondent submitted at the hearing the argument on the indivisibility of the Crown. Ms. Lavoie responded that Ms. Jensen had already decided this issue on the first motion. In any event, I find that in this case, Ms. Lavoie and Industry Canada agreed to leave pending all of Ms. Lavoie's allegations bearing on the new policy and the resulting relief measures. The parties did not divide the Crown into two distinct legal entities, but rather severed the allegations. Accordingly, the respondent's motion for inadmissibility is dismissed (see: Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 C.H.R.D. No. 15, paragraph 143).\nV. LEGAL BACKGROUND [108] Section 7 of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to continue to employ any individual, or in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination, including sex.\n[109] According to section 10 of the Act, it is a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or to enter into an agreement affecting any matter relating to employment that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[110] In a matter such as this, the burden of proof is first on the complainant, Ms. Lavoie, and the Commission, who must establish prima facie evidence of discrimination (see: Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission (1983), 4 C.H.R.R.D\/1616,1618; Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R.D\/5029; Premakumar v. Air Canada, T.D. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04; and Lincoln v. Bay Ferries, [2004] F.C.A. 204).\n[111] Prima facie evidence is evidence which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent (see: Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Etobicoke (Borough), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at page 208; Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at paragraph 28).\n[112] In Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd (supra, at paragraph 22 of the decision), the Federal Court of Appeal states that to answer the question as to whether prima facie evidence has been established, the Tribunal must not, at this stage, take into account the respondent's answer.\n[113] Once prima facie evidence has been established, the respondent's explanations must be reasonable or satisfactorily explain the otherwise discriminatory practice (see: Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., supra, paragraph 23 of the decision; Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), [2005] F.C.A. 154, at paragraphs 26 and 27).\n[114] It must be pointed out that the conduct of an employer will not be considered discriminatory if the employer is able to establish that any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) (paragraph 15(1)(a) of the Act). For a practice to be considered to have a BFOR, it must be established that the accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost (subsection 15(2) of the Act).\n[115] Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy or childbirth is discrimination on the basis of sex (subsection 3(2) of the Act and Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219). Subsection 3(2) also contemplates the period following childbirth (see for example: Tomasso v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 265, paragraphs 117 and 119).\n[116] In Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252, 1279 (Dickson J.), the Supreme Court of Canada defined discrimination on the basis of sex as follows:\n. . . practices or attitudes which have the effect of limiting the conditions of employment of, or the employment opportunities available to, employees on the basis of a characteristic related to gender.\n[117] The case law recognizes the difficulty establishing allegations of discrimination through direct evidence. The Tribunal must take into account all of the circumstances to establish whether there is what was described in Basi (supra) as the subtle scent of discrimination.\n[118] To determine whether there is discrimination on the basis of sex, I must examine the evidence filed by Ms. Lavoie regarding the effect of their policy on Ms. Lavoie's personal situation. I must also determine whether the new policy has discriminatory effects on female term employees based on gender. It is important to note that even if Ms. Lavoie's personal situation did not establish prima facie evidence of discrimination, I must nevertheless determine whether the respondent's new policy makes distinctions based on gender.\n[119] At the hearing, Ms. Lavoie and the respondent did not make any specific arguments regarding section 8 of the Act. I find on this basis that Ms. Lavoie abandoned this argument. Accordingly, my analysis will not bear on an alleged breach of this section.\n[120] In this case, Ms. Lavoie and the Commission must establish the following:\nThe respondent differentiated adversely against Ms. Lavoie in the course of employment when it refused to count the parental leave absence in determining her eligibility for an indeterminate appointment (section 7 of the Act). For the same reason, the new policy deprived Ms. Lavoie of employment opportunities (section 10 of the Act). By failing to include the maternity leave and parental leave, the respondent's new policy differentiates adversely in the course of employment (section 7 of the Act) in regard to female term employees who take maternity leave and\/or parental leave and deprives or tends to deprive these employees of employment opportunities on the basis of their sex (section 10 of the Act).\n[121] Ms. Lavoie alleges that in the course of employment, there was adverse differentiation in her regard because of the application of the new policy on the basis that from April 1, 2003, her leave of absence was no longer counted for the purposes of calculating cumulative service. Accordingly, she was four months short of the three years of uninterrupted service, depriving her of the right to become an indeterminate employee.\n[122] The respondent contends that all of the evidence submitted by Ms. Lavoie and the Commission is not sufficient to find that there was prima facie evidence of discrimination for the reasons that I would summarize as follows:\nParagraph 7(2)(a) of the new policy applies to all persons who are on leave without pay, including those on sick leave or disability leave, educational leave, secondment, personal obligation leave, etc. Accordingly, maternity leave and parental leave are not the only ones contemplated by the new policy. Considering the foregoing, the respondent submits that Ms. Lavoie as well as all of the female term employees taking maternity leave and\/or parental leave must be compared with others who are on leave without salary; Men and women are also contemplated by paragraph 7(2)(a) since, for example, men as well as women may take parental leave, sick leave or disability leave. As soon as a measure affects men as much as women in the same way, which would apply to this case, this measure cannot be considered discriminatory based simply on the fact that more women than men are likely to be affected by this measure; Only a measure with a disproportionate effect on female persons could be considered to discriminate on the basis of sex.\n[123] For the reasons stated hereafter, I find that the complainant, Ms. Lavoie, and the Commission established prima facie evidence of discrimination based on sex.\nVI. ANALYSIS A. Prima facie evidence of discrimination (i) The facts particular to Ms. Lavoie [124] Ms. Lavoie was given her first term employment contract in August 2000 as a programmer-analyst with Industry Canada. This contract for a term of one year was successively renewed in August 2001 and August 2002. There was no interruption of service between the contract renewals. I agree with Ms. Lavoie's claim that she had acquired the three years of cumulative service on August 5, 2003.\n[125] Ms. Lavoie's evidence indicates that Ms. Manseau told her that because of the extension of her maternity leave, she had to advise Ms. Lavoie that her employment contract would not be extended beyond August 5, 2003. There was therefore a need until August 5. I note indeed that this e-mail does not make any reference to the availability of work or the time for the duties to be performed. To the contrary, it is specified therein that there were competitions open for indeterminate appointments. Accordingly, I determine on this basis that the needs for which the complainant had been hired existed until August 5, 2003, and continued to exist beyond that date.\n[126] I also accept based on the evidence that before she left for her maternity leave, her future unavailability was called into question to such an extent that it was decided that she would change teams. Certainly, the supervisors changed their minds, but we cannot disregard the fact that the complainant's availability because of her announced maternity leave preoccupied Industry Canada representatives. Finally, the refusal to accommodate Ms. Lavoie by refusing her the opportunity to participate in training unless she assumed the costs herself appears to me to reinforce the idea that Ms. Lavoie's maternity leave was not appreciated.\n[127] Ms. Lavoie also testified that before she left on maternity leave in 2002, she was performing the same work as the indeterminate employees.\n[128] As stated earlier, in the time surrounding the coming into effect of the new policy, there were competitions held to fill seven indeterminate positions. These positions were filled, one of them by Ms. Lavoie's spouse.\n[129] From the preceding, I find that at all relevant times there was a permanent need for the term appointment of programmer-analyst for which the complainant had a contract ending on August 5, 2003, and that this need existed beyond August 5, 2003.\n[130] Ms. Lavoie's evidence establishes that but for the application of the new policy, i.e. not counting the parental leave time, Ms. Lavoie would have been appointed as an indeterminate employee as of August 6, 2003. The next step is to examine the new policy.\n(ii) The new policy [131] As already stated, the Long Term Specified Period Employment Policy (the former policy) provided for conversion of a position for any person who had worked in a term appointment for five years of cumulative service. Under the former policy, a period of unpaid leave was taken into account in calculating the five years of cumulative service.\n[132] According to the new policy which came into effect at Industry Canada on April 1, 2003, three years of cumulative service would be required to convert a term appointment to an indeterminate one. This new policy excludes unpaid leave from the calculation of cumulative service.\n[133] Maternity leave and parental leave are considered as leave without pay. Specifically, paragraph 7(2)(a) reads as follows:\nDepartments\/agencies, in determining whether a period of term employment in the same department\/agency will count as part of the cumulative working period, must take the following into consideration:\n(a) a period of leave of absence without pay longer than 60 consecutive calendar days does not constitute a break in service and will not be included in the calculation of the cumulative working period for appointment to indeterminate status under this policy;\n[134] Ms. Lavoie and the Commission submit that this paragraph is discriminatory toward the complainant and all female term employees on maternity leave and\/or parental leave.\n[135] Ms. Lavoie was entitled to 17 weeks of maternity leave and 37 weeks of parental leave. In fact, the complainant's period of absence coincided with the period during which she qualified for employment insurance benefits, i.e. 17 weeks of maternity leave, two weeks of waiting period and 37 weeks of parental leave.\n[136] In order to decide whether there is prima facie evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex, I must first determine the purpose of the plan conferring the benefit or the right at issue (see: Battlefords and District Co-operative Ltd. v. Gibbs, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 566, paragraph 33).\n[137] The purpose of the new policy is to balance the fair treatment of term employees with the need for operational flexibility. The policy statement states that the term employment option cannot be used to [fill] a permanent ongoing need.\n[138] In order to meet this objective, the respondent provided that term employees employed for a cumulative working period of three years without a break in service longer than 60 consecutive calendar days must [be] appoint[ed] . . . indeterminately at the level of his\/her substantive position. For the purposes of the analysis, I will describe the right to be appointed as an indeterminate employee the [translation] conversion entitlement.\n[139] This conversion entitlement is the issue in this matter. In matters of discrimination, a distinction must be made between the rights resulting from compensatory benefits and non-compensatory benefits, i.e. those relating to the employee's status. And so, a bilingualism bonus conditional on the performance of work falls under the first category. Performance of the work is required to obtain the bonus. Accrual of seniority, the right to employment, the right to keep one's employment, the right to tenure are described as non-compensatory benefits and relate to the status of the employee. Underlying this second category is the notion that performance of the work is not required to acquire or maintain the right. We are therefore referring to a benefit or a right that results from employee status (see primarily: Ontario Nurses Association v. Orillia Soldiers Memorial Hospital, (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 692, paragraphs 63, 70 and 71, applying the same criteria: Fernandes v. IKEA Canada, (2007) BCHRTD. No. 259, paragraphs 24, 25, 26, 27 and 31).\n[140] In this case, the conversion entitlement falls under the second category. It is intrinsically connected to the status of the employee. Accordingly, this implies that Ms. Lavoie and the other female term employees who take maternity leave and\/or parental leave must be compared to all term employees who did not take a break in service longer than 60 consecutive calendar days (see: Ontario Nurses Association v. Orillia Soldiers Memorial Hospital, supra, at paragraphs 63, 70 and 71).\n[141] The respondent submitted that the relevant comparator group was all of the employees on leave without pay. Accordingly, I could not find prima facie evidence of discrimination since all of the employees of this classification were treated equally (see: Bernatchez v. La Romaine (Conseil des Montagnais), 2006 CHRT 37 and Dumont-Ferlatte v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), 1996 D.C.D.P. No. 9). In both of these decisions, the complainants were claiming benefits described as compensatory, i.e. those that I described from the first category. Therefore in Bernatchez, the complainant was challenging the fact that her employer did not calculate the additional maternity leave benefits on the basis of the annual earnings of the persons who performed the work. The indemnity at issue was a benefit extended to employees on maternity leave and did not constitute earnings. Accordingly, the complainant had to be compared to persons on leave without pay. In Dumont-Ferlatte, the complainants alleged that it was discriminatory to deprive women on maternity leave of cumulative annual leave and sick leave credits and of the right to benefit from a monthly bilingualism bonus. Once again, the rights at issue are described as compensatory benefits.\n[142] The respondent also referred to Cramm (see: Cramm v. Canadian National Railway Company, 1998 IIJCan 2938 H.R.R.T. and Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canadian National Railway Company (re Cramm), (2000) IIJCan 15544 (F.C., Mr. Justice MacKay). Contrary to Ontario Nurses Association, I note that in Cramm, the debate bears primarily on the performance of work requirement. The Tribunal does not describe the nature of the right sought by Mr. Cramm. In other words, for the reviewing court, was this a right under the first or second category? In my opinion, this question is fundamental since the answer identifies the comparator group. As I already stated, I consider that the conversion entitlement falls under the second category. For the reasons given in the foregoing paragraphs, I find that the comparator group is that of employees who did not take a break in service longer than 60 consecutive calendar days.\n[143] I must point out that it is not always necessary to determine a comparator group. In this case, it is my opinion that for maternity leave, determining a comparator group appears pointless since only women take maternity leave. On this point, I agree with the comments made by the Court of Appeal of Qu\u00e9bec in Commission des \u00e9coles catholiques du Qu\u00e9bec v. Gobeil, (see: [1999] R.J.Q. 1883 (Robert J.)) where the Court held that a school board's refusal to hire, on a part-time basis, a teacher who was not available based on her pregnancy was discriminatory:\n[translation]\nPregnant women, but for their pregnancy, would be available. For this reason, I cannot adhere to a comparative analysis likening them to unavailable persons in order to determine whether or not there is a distinction. A rule that has the effect of depriving pregnant women of the right to be hired when they otherwise would have had access thereto necessarily breaches the right to full equality. The distinction created by the availability clause arises from the fact that childbirth and maternity leave hinder women from getting the contract to which they would be entitled.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[144] On its very face, excluding maternity leave absences of more than 60 consecutive days from the calculation of the cumulative service, in the course of employment, differentiates adversely in relation to term employees exercising their right to this leave (section 7) and deprives or tends to deprive them of employment opportunities (section 10). To use the wording of the Court of Appeal in Gobeil (supra), the connection between discrimination on the basis of sex and not including maternity leave is self-evident. In fact, only women take maternity leave. Further, when a woman takes maternity leave for 17 weeks, the time recognized for term employees, her absence necessarily exceeds the 60 calendar days. As a result, women who take maternity leave also extend the time for acquiring the conversion entitlement and even risk being deprived of this right if the term contract is not renewed in such a way as to recover the time that was not counted. This is in itself sufficient to establish prima facie evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex.\n[145] For parental leave, prima facie evidence must include establishing that there is a disproportionate negative effect on women since parental leave applies to men as well as women. For this reason, I must examine the statistical evidence (see: Walden v. Canada (Social Development), (2007) CHRD No. 54, paragraphs 39, 40 and 41, Premakumar, supra, paragraph 80).\n[146] Ms. Lavoie and the Commission submit that the statistical data clearly establish that it is largely women who take parental leave of more than 60 consecutive days. Ms. Lavoie and the Commission relied on table 12j (October 2007), primarily on the figures for the years 2003-2004. In this timeframe, 204 women took maternity leave and 164 took parental leave in the 52 weeks following the birth or adoption of a child. Indeed, we observe that 49 men benefited from parental leave in the same timeframe. In 2004-2005, 151 women took maternity leave, 169 women and 38 men took parental leave. In 2005-2006, 141 women took maternity leave, 136 women and 36 men took parental leave. During the same periods, table 12d (October 2007) indicates that a majority of men take parental leave for less than 60 days.\n[147] Besides the fact that we note that the data provided by the respondent at the request of the Commission indicates that in 2003-2004, one man went on maternity leave, it is my opinion that these figures are trustworthy. Accordingly, I dismiss the respondent's argument to the effect that the statistics are unreliable. These figures establish sufficient evidence of a disproportionate negative effect of the new policy on women who take parental leave. In fact, it is clear that more women than men take parental leave for more than 60 consecutive days. In 2003-2004, 77% of persons taking parental leave exceeding 60 consecutive days were women. This is a statistical reality that I cannot disregard. Like Ms. Lavoie, we must remember that women who take parental leave following the birth of a child have also taken maternity leave. Men are not likely to take both types of leave. Like women who take maternity leave, women who go on parental leave delay the time for acquiring the conversion entitlement and are deprived of this right if the term contract is not renewed in such a way that they will be able to recover the time that was not counted. In the case of Ms. Lavoie, this clearly had the effect of depriving her of the conversion entitlement.\n[148] In analyzing the prima facie evidence, I also considered the testimony of the Commission's expert, Dr. Reitz, whose findings were stated earlier. Bear in mind that Dr. Reitz determined, on analyzing the statistics, that the new policy has a negative effect on women and creates obstacles to their eligibility to become indeterminate employees and that some figures appear to suggest that the new policy significantly delays a number of women in acquiring indeterminate employee status.\n[149] Certainly, I observe that certain statistical data on the time required for women to obtain an indeterminate appointment includes appointment conversion situations, but also situations where the person obtains a permanent appointment through a competition. As the figures were filed by consent, certain explanations in their regard would have been desirable.\n[150] That said, I am of the opinion that I must take into consideration all of the circumstances to determine whether prima facie evidence of discrimination has been established (see: Premakumar, paragraphs 80 and 81). As I pointed out, prima facie evidence is evidence which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent (see: Ontario (Ontario Human Rights Commission) v. Etobicoke (Borough), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at page 208; Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at paragraph 28).\n[151] The respondent submits that the reviewing court in Cramm (supra) determined that quantitative evidence is insufficient to determine that more women than men suffer prejudicial effects. First, I observe that the reviewing court made these remarks after finding that it must compare the treatment of other employees absent on leave due to sickness or injury to those absent for other reasons. In this case, I dismissed the respondent's argument to the effect that the comparator group was all of the term employees on leave without pay. Therefore, I need not ask whether women on parental leave are differentiated more adversely than other employees on leave without pay. For the purposes of establishing whether or not there is prima facie evidence of discrimination, I can use statistical evidence to determine whether there is sufficient evidence. The statistical data submitted in this case clearly establishes that contrary to men, a substantial majority of women take more than 60 consecutive days of parental leave. The figures indicate that there is prima facie evidence of a disproportionate negative effect of the policy in regard to women who take parental leave.\n[152] Of the evidence filed, I find that the refusal to include maternity leave and\/or parental leave is prima facie evidence of discrimination in the course of employment, differentiating adversely (section 7 of the Act) in relation to female term employees who take maternity leave and\/or parental leave. This refusal to include the leave also establishes prima facie evidence of discrimination under section 10 of the Act, as it deprives or tends to deprive these employees of any employment opportunities on the basis of their sex (section 10 of the Act).\n[153] Finally, in the case of Ms. Lavoie, I find that the refusal to include her period of absence for parental leave establishes prima facie evidence of discrimination by differentiating adversely in her regard in the course of employment under section 7 of the Act and by preventing her from acquiring indeterminate employee status, which according to the terms of section 10 of the Act, deprived her of her employment opportunities.\n[154] In conclusion, all of the evidence submitted by Ms. Lavoie and the Commission establishes prima facie evidence of discrimination in breach of sections 7 and 10 of the Act (see: Premakumar, paragraph 80 and 81).\n[155] At the hearing, the possibility was raised that the complaint could also have been examined on the ground of discrimination on the basis of family status. However, the complaint exclusively contemplates discrimination on the basis of sex and the submissions at the hearing were based on the proposal to the effect that the discriminatory conduct was on the basis of sex. Accordingly, I will not formulate any conclusion on the ground of discrimination on the basis of family status.\nB. Did the respondent provide a reasonable explanation? [156] As mentioned earlier, once there is prima facie evidence of discrimination, the respondent must give a reasonable explanation. In this case, the respondent must establish that the refusal to include the period of absence of more than 60 consecutive days because of maternity leave or parental leave is based on a BFOR (paragraph 15(1)(a) of the Act). To this end, the respondent must establish that counting these absences for the purposes of conversion entitlement would impose undue hardship on the respondent in terms of health, safety and cost (subsection 15(2) of the Act). Before embarking on this analysis, I will address the evidence submitted by the respondent on the subject of parental leave trends and then the respondent's argument on the statistical evidence filed at the hearing.\n(i) Parental leave trends [157] The respondent contended that in my analysis, I must consider that more and more men are taking parental leave. The respondent's expert, Dr. Langlois, testified regarding an emerging trend in that area. Dr. Langlois is of the opinion that in Canada [translation] restrictive cultural norms in regard to women appear to be diminishing, resulting in an increase in the number of fathers taking longer parental leave, in part or entirely in the mother's place. That said, this trend does not mean that men take parental leave in the same proportion as women and for the same time. Dr. Langlois points out that in Canada, one inquiry established that more than two thirds of men returned to work in the month following the birth or adoption of the child.\n[158] For maternity leave, this trend is of no use given the biological reality associated with the birth of a child, including the psychological and physiological aspects for the mother in connection with the pregnancy and childbirth (see: Tomasso v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 265, paragraphs 117 and 119).\n[159] I must emphasize that the right to equality of Ms. Lavoie and other term employees taking parental leave must be assessed in the present based on the evidence filed. It cannot be inferred from a trend, or be deferred based on a trend.\n(ii) Statistical evidence filed at the hearing [160] While I consider that this aspect must be addressed in the prima facie evidence analysis, which was done, I would add a few remarks about the statistical evidence filed at the hearing. The respondent submits that according to Cramm (supra), mere numerical superiority of a group affected by a neutral rule does not establish in the absence of other evidence that there is a disproportionate negative effect on the largest numerical group. I think it worthwhile to point out that this remark was inspired by a decision of the Supreme Court bearing on section 15 of the Canadian Charter (see: Thibaudeau v. Canada, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 627 and Thibaudeau v. M.N.R., [1994] F.C. 189 (C.A.)). I am of the opinion that we cannot systematically apply this comment without taking into consideration the issues specific to each matter; especially in a context where the litigation does not arise from the Charter but from a human rights act. In Brooks (supra, paragraph 29), the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out, in a matter of discrimination based on pregnancy, that the removal of unfair disadvantages which have been imposed on individuals or groups in society is a fundamental objective of human rights legislation.\n[161] In a context where the respondent's expert recognizes that there are [translation] restrictive cultural norms in respect to women, we cannot abide by these norms or principles set out in Brooks when I note that a substantial majority of female term employees are the predominant users of the parental leave exceeding 60 consecutive days.\n(iii) Bona fide occupational requirement [162] The Supreme Court set out a three-step method for determining whether a BFOR has been established (see: British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin)). Hence, the respondent can justify the impugned standard if it establishes:\nthat the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer. The respondent must show that it considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation.\n(i) Did the respondent adopt the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job? [163] The objective of the new policy is to balance the fair treatment of term employees with the need for operational flexibility. The policy statement states that term appointments cannot be used to [fill] a permanent ongoing need. Therefore, the justification of reducing the cumulative service from five years to three years is largely supported by the evidence, particularly the testimony of Ms. Murphy and the report filed by the Joint Committee in August 2002. This report sets out several observations regarding the situation of term employees including primarily the great deal of insecurity felt by the majority of term employees. Insofar as the exclusion of leave without pay of more than 60 consecutive days from the cumulative service must be assessed in a more general context, such as the objective of the new policy, I find that this standard is rationally connected to the performance of the job and the duties at issue.\n[164] Accordingly, the first element of the defence has been established.\n(ii) Did the respondent adopt the standard in good faith? [165] On this point, I am of the opinion that the respondent adopted its standard in good faith. Accordingly, the second element of the defence has been established.\n(iii) Is the standard reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the respondent's objective in such a way that it cannot accommodate the complainant and the other women who take maternity leave and\/or parental leave without undue hardship? [166] From the outset, it must be emphasized that the new policy applies to employees like Ms. Lavoie, term employees of the respondent and who have been appointed under the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA) or any exclusion approval order made thereunder. While the new policy was the subject of a consultation with certain unions, this consultation cannot be used to justify the identified discriminatory effects.\n[167] The respondent argued that the exclusion of leave without pay of more than 60 consecutive days from the cumulative service must be assessed in the context where under this new policy, the period was reduced from five years to three years. In her testimony, Ms. Murphy explained that one of the concerns was avoiding workforce adjustments within the department. The risk of having a surplus of indeterminate employees in a unit could eventually lead to dismissals of indeterminate employees. This involves costs. Ms. Murphy stated that it had to be ensured that this new policy would not involve additional costs for the Crown.\n[168] Ms. Murphy also stated that the new policy is intended to strike a balance between fair treatment for term employees and maintaining a certain operational flexibility in favour of the managers. Ms. Murphy explained that for some managers, the two-year service period was too short to assess whether there was an ongoing need. According to the managers consulted, a two-year period would have prompted some of them to retain the services of temporary employees.\n[169] With regard to the work performance requirement, Ms. Murphy stated that this requirement was necessary in order to be able to assess the permanent needs of a position.\n[170] Ms. Murphy explained that these were all considerations in the adoption of the new policy, in its current form.\n[171] In my opinion, these considerations do not establish that it is impossible for the respondent to accommodate Ms. Lavoie and the other women taking maternity leave and\/or parental leave without undue hardship.\n[172] On the subject of the work performance requirement, I must admit that the respondent did not establish a connection between this requirement and the exclusion of unpaid leave of more than 60 consecutive days. First, I note that paid leave is counted for the purposes of calculating cumulative service. Therefore, the fact that the person is absent from work does not appear, at least in part, to always be a requirement.\n[173] Further, the former policy did not count leave without pay while the wording of this policy also provided that term appointments should be used only in situations where a need clearly exists for a limited time and is not anticipated to [fill] a permanent ongoing need. The new policy uses in essence the same wording, indicating that term employment cannot be used to [fill] a permanent ongoing need. From the foregoing, I must find that it is the needs of the position itself that are assessed and the performance of the work by the person appointed to that position does not determine these needs. People can, for example, be replaced. This is what occurred when Ms. Lavoie's spouse replaced her during one maternity leave. The needs for the position were therefore connected to the work to be performed.\n[174] The evidence does not establish that the respondent proceeded with an analysis contemplating the possibility of counting the unpaid leave in the calculation of cumulative service, specifically, maternity leave and parental leave. The respondent did not provide any evidence on this subject, or on how including this leave could cause undue hardship for the respondent. Inter alia, I do not have any evidence of the additional cost associated with counting this leave in calculating the three-year period. I cannot assess the existence of undue hardship on the basis of the evidence filed. In short, the respondent has not shown me that it would be impossible to include the time for maternity leave and parental leave in the calculation of cumulative service.\n[175] This same finding also applies to Ms. Lavoie's situation because the respondent's evidence does not establish the existence of undue hardship justifying the respondent's refusal to include the complainant's parental leave in calculating the three years. Finally, the respondent's evidence does not establish that it was impossible to include the time of the complainant's parental leave.\n[176] Yet, the collective agreement applicable to the parties provides in certain situations that maternity leave and parental leave are considered as service. The respondent thus appears to recognize the principle of accommodation and the relevance of counting this leave in service.\n[177] The evidence does not reveal any specific consideration or study on the part of the respondent on the possibility of accommodating women who take maternity or maternity leave. In a context where term employment with the respondent is a more vulnerable professional activity and where it is clearly recognized that women are very much in the majority in this type of precarious employment, the opportunity to accommodate these women taking maternity leave or parental leave became an incontrovertible issue.\n[178] The respondent, to use the words of Madam Justice McLachlin in Meiorin, chose a standard that is uncompromisingly stringent (supra, paragraph 62). A formula that can only be accepted en bloc, i.e.: three years excluding leave without pay, including maternity leave and parental leave. This en bloc formula establishes a lack of flexibility.\n[179] As pointed out by Julie C. Lloyd, member, in Hoyt v. Canadian National Railway, 2006 CHRT at paragraph 33: Employers must be innovative in their search to accommodate an employee. They must be flexible and creative.\n[180] The respondent has not established to me that it sought the flexibility and creativity that was necessary in this case.\n[181] I find that the respondent did not examine all of the options that would enable it to accommodate Ms. Lavoie and woman with term appointments taking maternity leave or parental leave.\n[182] The respondent is a significant employer with human and technical resources at its disposal enabling it to perform an appropriate analysis of the measures available that would not cause it undue hardship.\n[183] In short, the respondent did not file any evidence enabling me to find that in calculating cumulative service there is or was undue hardship caused by including Ms. Lavoie's parental leave, i.e. four months, or the maternity leave or parental leave taken by female term employees of the respondent since the new policy was adopted.\n[184] For all of these reasons, I find that the complaint is founded and must be allowed.\nVII. THE RELIEF REQUESTED BY MS. LAVOIE AND THE COMMISSION: A. Amendment of the policy to eliminate discriminatory aspects [185] Ms. Lavoie and the Commission are asking me to order the respondent to amend the new policy so as to eliminate the discriminatory aspects. In my opinion, such a request is appropriate. Insofar as the respondent maintains a standard whereby maternity leave or parental leave of more than 60 cumulative calendar days is not taken into account in calculating cumulative service for an indeterminate appointment, I am of the opinion that it is appropriate to order the respondent to amend the policy, so as to remove the aspects that discriminate on the basis of sex.\n[186] Accordingly, I order in accordance with paragraph 53(2)(a) of the Act, that the respondent cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring, and specifically order the respondent to amend the new Term Employment Policy which came into force on April 1, 2003, so as to remove the aspects that discriminate on the basis of sex, namely those relating to the exclusion of maternity leave and\/or parental leave from the calculation of cumulative service for indeterminate appointments.\nB. Loss of opportunities or privileges and loss of salary [187] In accordance with paragraph 53(2)(b), the Tribunal may order the respondent to make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice.\n[188] In accordance with paragraph 53(2)(c), the Tribunal may order a respondent to compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[189] The respondent acknowledged that if the complaint were allowed, the relief requested by Ms. Lavoie was admitted, including the amount claimed. This relief is as follows:\nTwo-week waiting period for employment insurance (August 19 to September 1, 2002): $2,008.00 Additional benefits (SUBP) for the period from September 2, 2002 to August 5, 2003: $28,959.00 Additional benefits (SUBP) for the period from August 6, 2003 to August 20, 2003: $1,864.26\n[190] However, the respondent contests the loss of salary claimed by the complainant for the period from September 19, 2003 to November 18, 2003. The amount claimed for this period is admitted, i.e. $5,790.99. However, the respondent argues that in signing the agreement with Industry Canada, Ms. Lavoie waived her claim to any loss of salary before the date she began the indeterminate appointment, i.e. November 19, 2003. For the same reasons stated in the matter of inadmissibility submitted by the respondent, I find that Ms. Lavoie did not waive the loss of the salary of which she was deprived as a result of the non-conversion of her appointment.\n[191] I would add that in acknowledging the right to the indemnity for the period from August 6, 2003 to August 20, 2003, the respondent acknowledges that Ms. Lavoie did not waive the claim to any loss of salary as of August 6, 2003, the date that she obtained the conversion entitlement for her appointment.\n[192] Accordingly, I award all of the relief sought by Ms. Lavoie pursuant to paragraphs 53(2)(b) and 53(2)(c), including $5,709.99 for the loss of salary for the period from September 19, 2003 to November 18, 2003.\n[193] Considering the foregoing, I order the respondent to pay to the complainant, Ms. Lavoie, $38,622.25 for loss of privileges and salary under paragraphs 53(2)(b) and 53(2)(c) of the Act.\nC. Special compensation [194] Pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(e), the Tribunal may award compensation of up to $20,000 to a victim as special compensation.\n[195] In my opinion, while the evidence was not substantial as to the moral repercussions that the respondent's practices had on the complainant, it is clear from her testimony that these events undeniably affected Ms. Lavoie and caused her loss of dignity. The right to employment is fundamental in our society and is an important component of human dignity. Further, I acknowledge inter alia the stress associated with financial responsibilities and with the fact that she knew it was all over as of August 6 2003. In short, it is apparent to me that Ms. Lavoie experienced periods of insecurity at a time when she had to assume the responsibility of three children.\n[196] Considering all of these circumstances, I order the respondent to pay to the complainant, Ms. Lavoie, $5,000.00 as compensation as provided under paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act.\nD. Interest [197] Interest is payable in regard to all of the monetary claims awarded pursuant to this decision in accordance with subsection 53(4) of the Act. I order that the interest be paid on the amounts awarded pursuant to this decision, in accordance with subsection 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure. The interest on the amounts awarded to compensate for the loss of privileges shall run from August 6, 2003, calculated from the time when benefits would have been payable. For the loss of salary corresponding to the amount of $5,790.99, interest shall run from September 19, 2003, also calculated from the time when benefits would have been payable to Ms. Lavoie. The interest on the compensation to be paid for moral prejudice shall run from the date of the filing of the complaint, i.e. January 19, 2004.\nVIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S ASSERTION OF JURISDICTION [198] The Tribunal shall retain its jurisdiction to receive evidence, to hear additional arguments and to make additional orders in the event that the parties disagree regarding the interpretation or the implementation of the relief ordered.\n[199] I retain my jurisdiction pursuant to the foregoing paragraph for 60 days from the date of receipt of this decision by the parties.\nKathleen Cahill OTTAWA, Ontario June 20, 2008\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T1154\/3606\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Brigitte Lavoie v.

Alternatively, the Respondents request that the case be reopened and the witnesses recalled for examination of the issue of the Complainant, Mr. Richard Warman, and the Commission posting messages on websites subject to complaints.\n[2] The Respondents allege that, in the present case, the Commission has not disclosed information relating the Commission\u2019s investigators secretly creating accounts on forums they judge controversial. The Respondents further argue that withholding this information constitutes a breach of the principles of natural justice and fairness as well as an abuse of process.\n[3] In support of these allegations, the Respondents rely on a statement made in the case of Warman v. Lemire by Ms. Margot Blight, the lead Commission attorney. The Respondents allege that the latter stated that the Commission\u2019s explicit policy has been to withhold such information from any Freedom of Information requests and legal disclosure responsibilities.\n[4] Furthermore, in relation to the Warman v. Lemire case, the Respondents allege that the Commission\u2019s lead investigator, Dean Steacy, testified that the Commission did not maintain a list or central registry of user accounts that the Commission and police created on forums. In addition, the Respondents allege that Mr. Steacy would have admitted in the course of his testimony that someone could technically be found liable for content posted by police or investigators as they didn\u2019t keep a central registry. The Respondents states that Mr. Steacy testified that in some cases, no one but he and one other Commission employee knew of the practice of creating infiltration accounts on forums being investigated.\n[5] The Respondents finally claim that considering that the present case involves hefty fines for a low-income simple parent and a possible lifetime ban to post messages contrary to a ridiculously vague Act [sic], the complaint should be dismissed.\n[6] The Complainant\u2019s position is that the present motion is unsupported by any evidence whatsoever and that the Tribunal cannot rule on it without reopening the case to hear evidence.\n[7] As for the Commission, it is of the view that nothing in the allegations made by the Respondents in their motion justifies in any way the granting of the motion to dismiss the complaint or reopen the case. The Commission argues that the allegations made by the Respondents would be more appropriately dealt with in the context of the constitutional challenge brought by the Respondents, which the Tribunal will deal with once a decision on the merits of the case has been rendered. In this respect, the Commission argues that the motion brought by the Respondents is untimely, without foundation and before the wrong forum.\n[8] The Tribunal has not yet ruled on the merits of the case. The Tribunal has already ruled that once a decision is rendered on the merits of the case, it would suspend the execution of its decision, if the Respondents were found to be in breach of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and entertain the constitutional challenge brought by the Respondents.\n[9] The Tribunal is of the view that, given the nature of the issues raised by the Respondents in the present motion, i.e. actions by the Commission contrary to the principles of natural justice and due process as well as the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Sections 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter, these will be better dealt with in the context of the constitutional challenge brought by the Respondents. The notice of constitutional question filed by the Respondents refers already to sections 1, 2(a), (b) and (d) as well as section 7 of the Act as the basis for the Respondents\u2019 constitutional challenge.\n[10] The proposition that the Tribunal should dismiss the present complaint on the basis of the testimony of witnesses rendered in another case has no legal basis. Furthermore, to reopen the case to hear additional evidence at this point in time would only prolong proceedings which have extended over an already too long period of time.\n[11] Hence, Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint and, alternatively, to reopen the case is denied. It will be open to the Respondents to raise again the issues contained in its motion in the context of the constitutional challenge that the Tribunal has already decided it would entertain once the decision on the merits has been rendered.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario June 24, 2008\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1089\/7005 and T1090\/7105\nStyle of Cause: Richard Warman v.

Hadjis\n[1] The interested party, Canadian Association for Free Expression, Inc. (CAFE), has made a motion demanding that I recuse myself from this case on the basis of a reasonable apprehension of bias. In its motion, CAFE states:\nRecently, due to Internet searches, it has come to the attention of CAFE that member Hadjis has on numerous occasions worked with the Canadian Jewish Congress, who have received Interested Party Status in these proceedings over the vigorous objections of the Respondent.\n[2] The Respondent indicated in his submissions on CAFE's motion that he supports CAFE's submissions that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias but sees no benefit to another member hearing either the motion or the case. I take it, therefore, that the Respondent is not seeking an order that I recuse myself. The interested party, Canadian Free Speech League (CFSL), has advised the Tribunal that it supports CAFE's argument that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias. None of the other parties has indicated any support of CAFE's motion.\n[3] CAFE requested in its motion that a separate Tribunal member hear this motion. However, as the Federal Court pointed out in Samson Indian Nation and Band v. Canada [1998] 3 F.C. 3 (F.C.T.D.), [1997] F.C.J. No. 1652 (Q.L.) at para. 66, aff'd Samson Indian Nation and Band v. Canada, 1998 CanLII 7815 (F.C.A.), the judge against whom a disqualification application is made should hear the application for recusal. No authority has been cited to me to support the assertion that a Tribunal member other than the one against whom the disqualification allegation is made must hear the application. Sara Blake states in Administrative Law in Canada, 4th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis Canada, 2006) at 114-5:\nWhen an allegation of bias is made, the tribunal should rule on the allegation. If it rules that it is not biased, it may continue with the hearing. It is not obliged to halt the proceeding. A tribunal is not to be paralysed every time someone alleges bias.\nIn Flamborough (Town) v. Canada (National Energy Board) [1984] F.C.J. No. 526 (F.C.A.), Justice Mahoney stated:\nI should have added that the proposition that a member of a tribunal against whom an allegation of an apprehension of bias has been made cannot, himself, dispose of or participate in disposing of that allegation is utterly fatuous. The practical effect, if that were the law, would be the paralysis of tribunals, and trial courts, at the whim of anyone willing to allege bias. The availability of judicial review and appeal ensures that such charges will, ultimately, be dealt with by a disinterested judiciary.\nI note that in Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 851, Justice Bastarache personally dealt with the motion seeking his recusal from the case. Where allegations of bias have been made before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in the past, it has been the practice for Tribunal members to hear and rule on the motions for recusal that have been brought against them (see e.g. Caza v. T\u00e9l\u00e9-M\u00e9tropole inc., (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/336; Warman v. Bahr, 2006 CHRT 46).\n[4] I will therefore render the ruling on CAFE's application for recusal.\nThe Test for Reasonable Apprehension of Bias\n[5] The test for reasonable apprehension of bias, as restated by the Supreme Court in Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2003 SCC 45 at para. 74, and derived from its previous decision in Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. v. National Energy Board et al., [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, is as follows:\nWhat would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - conclude?\nThe Court in Wewaykum noted that the standard refers to an apprehension of bias that rests on serious grounds, citing an excerpt from Committee for Justice and Liberty at 395, which states:\nThe grounds for this apprehension must, however, be substantial and I entirely agree with the Federal Court of Appeal which refused to accept the suggestion that the test be related to the very sensitive or scrupulous conscience.\n[6] It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court in Wewaykum, a case dealing with judicial bias, applied the Committee for Justice and Liberty test, which was developed in the context of administrative tribunals.\n[7] I have considered the matters raised by CAFE in its motion and have determined that the test for reasonable apprehension of bias has not been satisfied, for the reasons set out below.\nFacts Alleged [8] Although CAFE's motion refers to my having worked on numerous occasions with the Canadian Jewish Congress, only one incident is cited in its motion:\nOn November 24, 1997, Athanasios Hadjis issued a joint press release with the Canadian Jewish Congress denouncing Jacques Parizeau, claiming that Mr. Parizeau blame[s] particular communities around the result of a democratic process. Mr. Hadjis went on to say that such an attitude is irresponsible as it contributes to the exacerbation of tensions within our society. The Canadian Jewish Congress states in its press release that the CJC and Mr. Hadjis's Hellenic Congress of Quebec are a coalition.\n[9] CAFE did not provide the Tribunal with a copy of the press release in question and I do not specifically recollect it. I can state though that it most certainly would not have been a joint press release by me and the CJC, and that the Hellenic Congress of Quebec (HCQ) was definitely not Mr. Hadjis's. Obviously some clarification is needed. The HCQ was an umbrella organization for various associations active within Quebec's Greek (Hellenic) community. The HCQ's mandate, as I recall, included articulating the views of Quebecers of Hellenic origin on matters of public interest. I served on the Board of Directors of the HCQ from about 1993 until January 1999.\n[10] During the 1990's, as all Canadians are well aware, Quebecers engaged in a public debate about the province's future within Canada. Part of this discussion touched upon the role and views of Quebec's minorities on the matter, and the HCQ did not hesitate to express the Hellenic community's opinions and concerns in this regard. It eventually became evident that other cultural communities (ethnic groups) within Quebec shared similar opinions. Thus, the HCQ occasionally issued joint statements and presented briefs with organizations representing these other communities, in particular the Italian community (National Congress of Italo-Canadians) and the Jewish community (Canadian Jewish Congress, Quebec Region). The joint press release referred to in CAFE's motion may have been one of those joint statements. The role of HCQ spokesperson was rotated amongst the members of the HCQ's Board of Directors. In addition to these media statements, the three groups also organized meetings between members of their communities and other Quebecers in order to encourage and foster dialogue.\n[11] At no time did any of the matters discussed between these organizations while I was involved deal with any of the issues arising in the present complaint, including hate messages, freedom of expression, the Canadian Human Rights Act, and the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Furthermore, I do not know nor have I ever dealt with any of the individuals who have represented the CJC in the present case. I would note finally that I have never been a member of the CJC nor have I ever acted as their counsel.\nAnalysis [12] To begin with, as the Supreme Court noted in Wewaykum, supra, at para. 85, the passage of time is a significant factor that must inform the perspective of the reasonable person assessing the impact of a member's or judge's involvement. The Court pointed out that most arguments for disqualification rest on circumstances that are either contemporaneous to the decision-making, or that occurred within a short time prior to the decision-making. My involvement with the HCQ dates back over nine years, and my last dealings with the CJC Quebec Region, to even earlier than that. This is a significant period of time.\n[13] In Z\u00fcndel v. Citron, [2000] 2 F.C. 225 at paras. 43-5, the Federal Court of Appeal highlighted the fact that the Tribunal member in question had been assigned to the case nine years after the publication of a press release that was the basis of the recusal application. The Court held that this passage of time, along with certain other factors, was sufficient to expunge any taint of bias. In Weywaykum, supra, the issue giving rise to the request for Justice Binnie's recusal had taken place 15 years prior to the hearing in which he was sitting. The Court found that a reasonable person, viewing the matter realistically, would not come to the conclusion that Justice Binnie's prior activity affected his ability, even unconsciously, to remain impartial (at para. 90 of the decision).\n[14] The nature of the adjudicator's involvement is also a significant factor. In Arsenault-Cameron, supra, at para. 4, Justice Bastarache cited with approval a finding from a South African court to the effect that no recusal application could be founded on a relationship of advocate unless the advocacy was regarding the case to be heard. However, even when there is involvement in the same case, the passage of time can serve to mitigate the apprehension of bias. In Wewaykum, the matter in question related to Justice Binnie's involvement, as Assistant Deputy Minister in the federal Justice Department, in the very case under appeal that he was now adjudicating as a member of the Court, and in which the Attorney General of Canada was a party. Nonetheless, the Court concluded that a reasonable apprehension of bias had not been established and Justice Binnie was not disqualified from hearing the appeals.\n[15] As I have already indicated, my involvement with the HCQ and, more importantly, its dealings with the CJC Quebec Region, were not related in any way to the matters at issue in this case. I find that this factor together with the significant passage of time would, on that basis alone, lead an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, to conclude that there does not exist a reasonable apprehension of bias in this case.\n[16] However, CAFE has cited a number of events that occurred during the hearing to argue that there is in fact a reasonable apprehension of bias. Before addressing them, I think it is important to note the comments of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Middelkamp v. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board, 1993 CanLII 2884 at paras. 11, 13, cited with approval in Samson, supra (F.C.T.D.):\nAs I believe the Chief Justice of this Court has said on more than one occasion, a trial is not a tea party. But bias does not mean that the judge is less than unfailingly polite or less than unfailingly considerate. Bias means a partiality to one side of the cause or the other. It does not mean an opinion as to the case founded on the evidence nor does it mean a partiality or preference or even a displayed special respect for one counsel or another, nor does it mean an obvious lack of respect for another counsel, if that counsel displays in the judge's mind a lack of professionalism.\n. . .\nBias does not equate with what might be found in the end to be an unsatisfactory trial.\nI will leave it to others to judge whether I have been unfailingly polite and considerate with all parties in this case, but even a failure to meet these standards does not necessarily constitute evidence of bias.\n[17] CAFE suggests in its motion that my ruling early in this hearing process to allow the CJC to participate as an interested party over the vigorous objections of the Respondent indicates bias. My decision to grant the CJC leave to participate in this case along with all the other interested parties (Warman v. Lemire, 2006 CHRT 8) was given with self-explanatory reasons that would not, in my view, lead an informed person viewing the matter realistically and practically to conclude that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists. Furthermore, like any Tribunal ruling, it is subject to judicial review. I would also note in passing that the Tribunal granted CAFE interested party status in this case over the equally vigorous objections of the Commission.\n[18] CAFE places great emphasis as well on the Tribunal's alleged rush to end the case even though a number of documents had been recently disclosed. CAFE suggests that this is demonstrative of some party's pressure on the Tribunal to get this hearing over. The matter of the case's scheduling and the treatment of documents that have been produced since June 2007 has been addressed in my ruling of June 5, 2008, Warman v. Lemire, 2008 CHRT 20. I believe it should be evident from paragraphs 26 and following of that decision what factors were considered by the Tribunal for the scheduling of hearing dates in this case. They are not demonstrative, in my view, of any undue influence by, or bias in favour of, some party in this case.\n[19] CAFE also claims that bias was demonstrated by me when all the work was put onto Respondent counsel to argue why the hearing should proceed following the Federal Court's decision of January 15, 2008, with respect to the application that he had mounted pursuant to s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act. I would note, first of all, that the Court had indicated, without providing details, that the information that formed the subject of the s. 37 application had been disclosed. This raised the possibility that any further examinations of the witnesses who were to testify regarding this information were no longer necessary. Furthermore, all parties were invited to make submissions on how the case should proceed, not just the Respondent. The Respondent was asked to present his submissions first, partially because his counsel had indicated, during the case management conference call of February 6, 2008, that she intended to file some additional evidence. The Respondent's counsel did not express any objection to proceeding this way during the conference call. In any event, I fail to see how these circumstances are demonstrative of bias.\n[20] CAFE makes a similar claim with respect to my decision to request that the Respondent provide me with mountains of documents. These were in fact digital copies of Commission documents containing redactions to which the Respondent objected, which were sent to the Tribunal by email, in PDF file form. As I explained in my ruling, Warman v. Lemire, 2008 CHRT 16, at para. 1, I had asked the Respondent to provide me with those copies in order to gain a better understanding of the subject matter of the dispute that had given rise to an exchange of numerous letters amongst the parties. After viewing the documents, I issued the above mentioned ruling in which I ordered the Commission to provide me with the unredacted version of those documents, for comparison and determination of the validity of those redactions. Again, I do not see how these facts are demonstrative of bias.\n[21] In sum, therefore, I am not persuaded that the information and submissions put forward by CAFE would lead an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - to conclude that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists. The serious or substantial grounds required for such an apprehension of bias have not been established.\n[22] I would also underscore CAFE's statement in its motion that the joint press release only came to its attention recently, due to Internet searches. There is no evidence to indicate that this information has not been publicly available on the Internet or elsewhere since CAFE's involvement began in this case (February 23, 2006) nor indeed since 1997 when the press release was apparently published. Arguably, CAFE may have impliedly waived any assertion of a reasonable apprehension of bias as a result (see In Re Human Rights Tribunal and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. [1986]1 F.C. 103 (F.C.A.)). I need not make any findings on this point, however, given my earlier conclusions on the bias claim.\n[23] For these reasons, CAFE's application for my recusal is denied.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Lloyd\nI. INTRODUCTION\nII. THE ISSUES\nIII. EVIDENCE AND ANALYSIS\nIV. REMEDIES\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] The complainant, Jean Bignell-Malcolm, is a First Nations woman of Cree descent. She alleges that the respondent, Ebb and Flow Indian Band, refused to hire her as the Director of Education for the Ebb and Flow School because of her race and ethnic or national origin, contrary to section 7(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[2] The respondent, Ebb and Flow Indian Band, is a First Nations band constituted under the Indian Act of Canada. The Ebb and Flow community is located approximately two hundred kilometers north of Winnipeg, Manitoba and is comprised of persons of different races, ethnic and national origins, though the majority of the population is Ojibway.\n[3] The hearing extended 5 days in October of 2007. The complainant, the respondent and the Canadian Human Rights Commission were represented by counsel.\nII. THE ISSUES [4] The issues for determination in this complaint are as follows:\nHas the complainant made out a prima facie case that the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice by refusing to hire her because of her race or her national and ethnic origin? If the complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination, has the respondent provided a reasonable explanation for the otherwise discriminatory conduct? If the complaint is found to have been substantiated, what remedies are appropriate?\nIII. EVIDENCE AND ANALYSIS [5] Where a complainant, as Ms. Bignell-Malcolm has, makes an allegation that she has been refused employment for discriminatory reasons, the onus starts with her. The complainant must first make out a prima facie case of discrimination. If such a case is proved, then the onus shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation.\na) Has the complainant, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm, made out a prima facie case of discrimination?\n[6] There is no rigid test to be applied where considering whether a prima facie case of discrimination has been made out in a complaint alleging refused employment. A trier of fact must be flexible and sensitive to the facts of each case. Ultimately, the question will be whether the complainant has satisfied the test set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpson Sears [1985] 3 S.C.R. 36 at 558 (O'Malley): if believed, is the evidence led by the complainant complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent?\n[7] That being said, it will often be sufficient for the complainant in circumstances such as this to prove the following facts. First, that she or he applied a job for which he or she was qualified, but did not receive it. Second, that a person no more qualified, but not sharing a personal characteristic enumerated as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the CHRA, got the job, or that the employer continued to advertise for the position (see Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd. (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001; Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights and Public Service Commission (1983), 4 C.H.R.R.D. and Premakumar v. Air Canada [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 3, (at paragraph 77).\n[8] The relevant evidence led by this complainant is as follows.\nComplainant's Evidence\n[9] Ms. Bignell-Malcolm testified that she had been a resident of the Ebb and Flow community for more than 20 years by the time the events relevant to this complaint took place. She moved to the community after marrying a member of the Ebb and Flow Indian Band in about 1982 and she became a member of the Band in 1984.\n[10] Ms. Bignell-Malcolm testified that she began working at the Ebb and Flow School in 1983, working first as a secretary. In 1992 she commenced a Bachelor of Education degree with a focus in aboriginal education. While she earned her degree Ms. Bignell-Malcolm worked at the Ebb and Flow School as a counselor. She completed her Bachelor of Education degree in about 1998 and then continued her studies, earning a 5th year certificate in education and administration, again with a focus on aboriginal education. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was a teacher at the Ebb and Flow School from 1995 to 1999 and then commenced work with the Western Region Tribal Council in Dauphin, Manitoba, as its Director of Education. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm continued to live in the Ebb and Flow community and commuted to and from Dauphin.\n[11] In about May of 2003, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm learned that the Ebb and Flow Indian Band was looking for a Director of Education for its school. A job posting for the position had been published in the community. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm testified that she reviewed the job requirements listed in the posting and knew that she met each of the listed requirements. The qualifications listed for the position included those of a University Degree in Education with a 5th year designation in Administration and four years of previous experience in education administration. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm applied for the job.\n[12] On June 23 of 2003, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was interviewed for the position. In attendance at the interview were the Band Chief, the four members of the Band Council, the four members of the Band's Education Committee, and at least one of the community's Elders. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm described the interview as a very positive experience. For close to an hour she shared her thoughts and vision for the Ebb and Flow School and education system. She described the tone of the meeting as very amicable.\n[13] On July 10, 2003, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm learned that she had been offered the job. Ralph Beaulieu, the Chief of the Ebb and Flow Indian Band, had written to advise her that she was being offered the position of Director of Education. The Chief had also advised Ms. Bignell-Malcolm that the start date for the position would be August 1, 2003 and that there would be a meeting set up later in the month of July to discuss the terms of her employment, including her salary. A salary range for the position had not been included in the job posting or in the offer of employment. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm wrote to the Western Region Tribal Council resigning her position effective August 1, 2003.\n[14] In mid-July, 2003, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm received a telephone call from a friend and former colleague at the Ebb and Flow School. Her friend advised Ms. Bignell-Malcolm that she had heard rumours that the Chief and Band Council had decided to offer Ms. Bignell-Malcolm a salary much lower than one she should receive given the position, her education and experience. She further advised that the salary offer would be made in an attempt to discourage Ms. Bignell-Malcolm from taking the job. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm testified that she did not take much notice of this information. It was her testimony that after such a positive interview experience, after being offered the job and welcomed by the Chief to the Ebb and Flow School system, she was sure that she would be treated fairly regarding the terms of her employment, including the matter of her salary.\n[15] On July 23, 2003, Ms. Bignell Malcolm attended at a further meeting to discuss the terms of her employment. She testified that she arrived for the meeting at noon, the time she was advised that the meeting would start, and that she was made to wait nearly two hours before being called in. In attendance at the meeting were again, the Chief, the Band Councilors and the members of the Education Committee. Ms. Houle, the acting Director of Education was also in attendance along with at least one Elder. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm testified that the atmosphere at this meeting, unlike that of the June 23, 2003 interview meeting, was very tense. There was no opening prayer, which was the community's custom before meetings commenced. She testified that Chief Beaulieu advised her that the Band would offer a salary of $52,000.00 per annum. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm testified that she was taken aback by this offer. She was earning $60,000.00 per year working as Education Director for the Western Region Tribal Council. She was also aware that the former Direction of Education for the Ebb and Flow School system earned an annual salary of over $60,000.00 and she knew that at least one of the school counselors at the school, an employee to whom she would be much superior, earned $58,000.00 per year. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm expressed her concern about the salary level and proposed that she receive $72,000.00. She was asked to leave the room to allow the other attendees to discuss further the matter of her salary.\n[16] When she returned to the meeting room, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm testified that Chief Beaulieu said to her sternly, The offer is $55,000.00. Take it or leave it. She testified that she immediately accepted the job. She had resigned her position as Director of Education for the Western Region Tribal Council and felt that she had no choice but to accept the position even though she thought the salary unduly low. The Chief told her that he would give her until Friday, July 25, 2003 to tender a written acceptance of the offer. She testified that the next day, July 24, 2003, she gave the letter accepting the offer to her husband, Robert Malcolm, who worked at the Band office, and asked him to deliver it to the Chief's office. A copy of the letter was entered as evidence at the hearing. The letter carries a stamp that indicates it was received at the Band office on July 24, 2007.\n[17] On July 24, 2003, at 11:00 p.m., Ms. Bignell-Malcolm testified, Chief Beaulieu called her at home, waking her up. The Chief advised that the offer of employment had been rescinded. He did not tell her why. He did, however, mention that he had received a petition from some residents of the community, implying, she believed, that this petition was, at least in part, the reason for the decision to rescind the offer of employment. The Chief did not read the petition to her or summarize its content.\n[18] The position of Director of Education continued to be performed by Ms. Houle, who was at the time the acting Director of Education. Ms. Houle had a four-year Education degree and had been a school counselor at the Ebb and Flow School for several years. Ms. Houle had neither training nor experience in education administration. She was Ojibway. The Band continued to advertise for the position of Director of Education and eventually hired Arlene Mousseau for the position. Ms. Mousseau had a Bachelor of Education degree. Ms. Mousseau, did not, however, have the 5th year certificate in education and administration earned by Ms. Bignell-Malcolm, an advertised requirement for the position, and did not have Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's experience either in teaching or administration. Ms. Mousseau was not Cree. She was Ojibway.\n[19] I find that a prima facie test of discrimination has been made out on these facts alone. The complainant, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm, has led evidence in support of the asserted facts. First, she was qualified for the job of Director of Education for the Ebb and Flow school. Then, she applied for the job and did not get it. Ms. Houle, who continued as acting Director of Education, was not more qualified and was not of Cree descent. Ms. Houle did not share Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's race or national or ethnic origin. The respondent continued to advertise for the position and it was later filled by Ms. Mousseau. Ms. Mousseau was not more qualified for the position and again, being Ojibway, did not share Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's, race or national or ethnic origin.\nAdditional Evidence\n[20] While not necessary for Ms. Bignell-Malcolm to make out her prima facie case of discrimination, other evidence was tendered by the complainant at the hearing that will be relevant to my analysis of whether the respondent's explanation for its prima facie discriminatory conduct was reasonable. I will deal with this evidence here to suit the narrative.\n[21] Ms. Bignell-Malcolm, prior to filing the within complaint, retained counsel and commenced a civil law suit for wrongful dismissal after her employment offer was rescinded. In the course of advancing the civil litigation, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm received a copy of the petition mentioned earlier. Further, counsel for Ms. Bignell-Malcolm examined Ms. Houle for discovery in the civil law suit and her transcript on discovery as well as the petition were tendered as evidence. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm testified that it was upon hearing Ms. Houle's evidence and upon reviewing the petition, that she became convinced that she had been a victim of discrimination and filed the within complaint. I did not hear evidence about the status of the wrongful dismissal suit at the time of the hearing of this complaint.\n[22] Counsel for the respondent argued that neither the petition nor the transcript were admissible before this Tribunal as evidence. I find, however, for the following reasons that both the petition and the transcript of the examination for discovery of Ms. Houle are admissible.\n[23] There is a principle of general application in civil litigation that evidence obtained in one proceeding is confidential and is not to be disclosed for any purpose other than those of the proceeding in which the evidence was obtained (Lac d'Amiante du Quebec Ltee. v 2858-0702 Quebec Inc. [2001] 2 S.C.R. 743 (Lac d' Amiante) and J-Sons Inc. v. N.M. Paterson & Sons Ltd., [2003] M.J. No. 461 (C.A.) (J-Sons). In the province of Manitoba, where Ms. Bignell-Malcolm commenced her wrongful dismissal action, this principle has been codified in Rule 30.1(3) of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench Rules, Manitoba Regulation 553\/88 as amended. All parties and their lawyers are deemed under this Rule to have undertaken not to use evidence collected for any other purpose.\n[24] In civil litigation, the discovery process undertaken before the trial of a matter allows parties adverse in interest to compel one another to disclose documents and to answer questions whether the other party wants to make disclosure and answer questions or not. This invasion of privacy is deemed necessary to do justice between the parties to a law suit in advance of a trial. The fruits of discovery, however, must be used only to serve this justice and must otherwise be kept confidential. It is improper to use them for any collateral purpose or in any other proceeding (J-Sons, supra and Lac d'Amiante, supra). This principle of confidence protects individual privacy interests and preserves the integrity of the process of civil litigation as without this protection of privacy, parties to a law suit might fail to make complete disclosure of all of the facts relevant to a law suit. Persons found to have violated this rule of confidentiality can be held to be in contempt of court (N.M. Paterson & Sons Ltd. v. St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corp. [2002] F.C.J. No. 1713 aff'd [2004] F.C.J. No. 946 (C.A.)).\n[25] While the CHRA directs that this Tribunal is not bound by the ordinary rules of evidence (s. 50(3)(c)), section 50(4) directs that a panel may not admit in evidence anything that would be inadmissible in a court by reason of any privilege. My reading of Lac d'Amiante, particularly paragraph 42 of that decision suggests to me that the principle of confidence is a form of privilege. LeBel J., discussing the common law roots of the principle of confidentiality, writes that where evidence is relevant and not protected by some other form of privilege, the evidence is producible and the principle of confidence attaches. For the purpose of the following analysis I will assume without deciding that the principle of confidence is a form of privilege.\n[26] The confidence principle is not, however, without limit. The Supreme Court of Canada in Lac d'Amiante, supra, identified that while the principle of confidentiality is central to the protection of privacy interests and to the preservation of the integrity of the civil litigation system, there can be circumstances where exceptions are properly made.\n[27] One exception to the confidence principle identified in Lac d'Amiante arises in the context of impeachment. The confidentiality rule can be found to have no application where a party wishes to establish in another proceeding that a witness has given inconsistent versions of the same fact (Lac d'Amiante, supra, at para. 77). This exception is codified in the Manitoba Rules. Rule 30.1(6) directs that the confidentiality undertaking does not prohibit the use of evidence obtained in one proceeding to impeach the testimony of a witness in another proceeding.\n[28] The transcript of Ms. Houle was tendered for the purpose of impeaching her testimony and accordingly, the evidence is admissible, being an exception to the principle of confidentiality.\n[29] The following is the relevant excerpt of the transcript of the examination for discovery of Ms. Houle:\nQ: Do you speak Saulteaux?\nA: Yes, I do, fluently too.\nQ: What language do the teachers use when they are in a classroom? English or Saulteaux?\nA: English and we have a Native Studies, Native language. And that's one of the reasons the elders didn't really accept Jean, because she is Cree and none of us are Cree. We are all Ojibway.\nQ: So the elders didn't like the idea of having somebody Cree who has a Cree background as education director?\nA: Yes, they also said how are we going to communicate with her when she doesn't even speak our language.\nQ: The elders, I take it, all speak at least some level of English?\nA: Some.\n[30] A second exception to this principle is evidence can be found to be admissible in another proceeding where to do so would serve the interests of justice. (Lac d'Amiante, supra, at para 76). This exception has also been codified in the Manitoba Rules. Rule 30.1(8) directs that a court may order that the deemed confidentiality undertaking can be held inapplicable where it is found that the interests of justice outweigh any prejudice that would result.\n[31] I find that the petition is admissible in service to the interests of justice. First, the petition is evidence of a nature that would support an inference that the respondent had included a discriminatory consideration in its decision to rescind Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's offer of employment. The purpose of the relevant section of the CHRA is to eliminate discrimination in the area of employment. It has been long recognized that the purpose of human rights legislation is that of the protection of fundamental human rights, a purpose of vital importance in Canadian society (Zurich Insurance Corp. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 321 at paragraph 57). Admitting evidence that would support an inference of discrimination serves a purpose of vital importance and serves the interests of justice.\n[32] Weighing the interests of justice against the prejudice that might be visited on the respondents should this document be disclosed, I find that the balance favors disclosure. In reaching this conclusion I note that the petition was circulated widely among the Elders in the Ebb and Flow community and was given to a child for delivery to the Chief in a public place. I also note that in the minutes of the Chief and Council meeting dated July 25, 2003, during which the decision to rescind the job offer was made, the petition was made an attachment. It does not appear that this document was dealt with in a manner that would suggest it was intended to be kept confidential.\n[33] Further, a petition is a document of a rather public nature. Petitions, such as this one, are a demand or a prayer issuing from its signators to a governing body, a public body, in the hope that the governing body, here the Chief and Council, will take a particular action. This type of document is not one that one would consider confidential in most circumstances. I find that little prejudice would be visited on the respondent by the disclosure of the petition and that the interests of justice outweigh any prejudice that might be experienced. I find for these reasons that the document is admissible in the present proceeding.\n[34] A relevant portion of the petition reads as follows: It took many years for the previous Chief and Council to gain control over our Education and it was their promise to us that we would always have our own people administering our Education program. Jean does not even speak our language. As Elders we promote our Education program. Will an interpreter be provided to us when we speak to Jean?\n[35] The Manitoba rules regarding this confidentiality principle contemplate that a party will seek a court's approval in advance of disclosing evidence produced in any particular proceeding. The complainant did not do so. It is possible that the respondent may have some recourse before the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench. I do not believe, however, that the complainant's failure to seek such prior approval means that this Tribunal is unable to admit the evidence if satisfied that admission is proper and appropriate in the circumstances, as I have on the facts before me.\nb) Has the respondent provided a reasonable explanation for the prima facie discriminatory conduct?\n[36] As a prima facie case of discrimination has been made out, the onus shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for its otherwise discriminatory conduct. The respondent has the burden of rebutting the complainant's prima facie case by providing a reasonable explanation for its decision to rescind Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's offer of employment. (Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [2005] F.C.J. No. 731 at paragraph 36 (C.A.), Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., [2004] F.C.J. No. 941 at paragraph 23 (C.A.))\n[37] The evidence led by the respondent and relevant to its explanation, was as follows.\nRespondent's Evidence\n[38] Charles Cochrane gave evidence at the hearing. Mr. Cochrane was the first Director of Education for the Ebb and Flow School, holding the position from 1997 to 2003. It was Mr. Cochrane's evidence that in 1995 the Band decided to assume direct control of its education system. The Department of Indian and Northern Affairs controlled the local school before then. Mr. Cochrane described that between 1995 and 2003 there were extensive community consultations while the community's education policy was finalized. The education policy manual was finally published in January of 2003.\n[39] Mr. Cochrane described that during this period of extensive consultation, the community made a clear direction that they wanted to ensure that any Director of Education for the Ebb and Flow School must be fluent in Saulteaux.\n[40] Chief Beaulieu gave evidence at the hearing. The Chief testified that the job posting for the position of Director of Education was supposed to include fluency in the Ojibway language as a requirement, but the requirement had been omitted. The Chief described that this language requirement was a widespread community expectation: the community expected that the Director of Education for the Ebb and Flow School would speak Saulteaux. Chief Beaulieu testified that it was the Band manager, Robert Malcolm, who prepared the job posting and that the Chief had not reviewed the posting in advance of it being circulated. Robert Malcolm is the husband of Ms. Bignell-Malcolm, and the Chief testified that while the omission may have been an error, he suspected that Mr. Malcolm had omitted the qualification deliberately so that his wife would be able to win the position even though she did not speak Saulteaux and was therefore not qualified.\n[41] Chief Beaulieu testified that when the job candidates were interviewed, no questions were asked with respect to fluency in Saulteaux. The Chief testified that each of the interviewers were supplied with a list of questions that were to be asked of each candidate. This list of questions did not include a question asking whether the candidate was fluent in Saulteaux. The list of questions had been prepared by Mr. Malcolm, the Band manager, and again the omission was the result of Mr. Malcolm's mistake or misdeed. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was offered the job, the Chief testified, because her qualifications and her performance in the interview were superior to the other candidates. As the language requirement had not arisen, it was decided that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was the most qualified. Had any of the persons involved in the interview and candidate selection process remembered that fluency in Saulteaux was a requirement for the position of Director of Education, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm would not have been offered the job.\n[42] The Chief testified that the meeting of July 23, 2003 was acrimonious in tone. The Chief did not remember whether Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was made to wait for two hours before being called in. He testified that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was rude from the moment she joined the meeting. The Chief testified that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm announced as soon as she entered the room that she would not work with the Education Committee. He testified that she pointed her finger aggressively at him and declared, I will only talk to you. He testified that he was shocked by Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's behavior at the meeting. He testified that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was offered, at first, $52,000.00 per year, that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm objected that the salary was far too low. He had further discussions with the panel members and increased the offer to $55,000.00 per year. He testified that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm did not accept the job during the meeting. She was given until Friday, July 25, 2007 to consider the offer and to tender a written response.\n[43] The Chief testified that it did not occur to him, until the evening of July 24, 2003, that as Ms. Bignell-Malcolm did not speak Saulteaux, she was not qualified for the position of Director of Education. On that evening, Chief Beaulieu testified, he was playing pool with his brother. A young girl from the community came to the pool hall and gave him the petition mentioned earlier in these reasons. The Chief testified that it was only upon looking at the petition that he realized the mistake made that led to Ms. Bignell-Malcolm being offered the position. The Chief testified that he immediately went to his father's home. His father had been the Chief of the Ebb and Flow Indian Band for twenty years prior to the start of Chief Beaulieu's tenure as Chief. Chief Beaulieu's father had signed the petition. The Chief testified that he sought his father's advice and that his father told him that he should listen to the Elders. The Chief testified that he decided to follow his father's advice; he decided to listen to the Elders and to rescind the employment offer because the petition had reminded him that fluency in Saulteaux was a requirement for the position of Director of Education and that for this reason, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was not qualified for the job. The Chief denies that race, national or ethnic origin were considerations informing the decision. Language was the only consideration.\n[44] Chief Beaulieu testified that he called the members of his Band Council. He was able to reach two of the four councillors and the two he spoke to were in agreement that the offer made to Ms. Bignell-Malcolm must be rescinded because she was not fluent in the Ojibway language. The Chief testified that after having obtained the approval of a majority of Chief and Council, he immediately called Ms. Bignell-Malcolm to advise her that the offer was being rescinded. The next morning the Chief and his council members met at the Band office and formally ratified the decision. The Chief testified that he did not receive Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's letter accepting the job until Monday, July 28, 2003. The Chief testified that he did not know why the letter carried a stamp indicating that it had been received in the Band office on July 24, 2003. He testified that it was Mr. Malcolm, the Band Manager and Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's husband, might have stamped the letter and marked it with a date that was incorrect.\nIs the Respondent's Explanation Reasonable?\n[45] I find that if the respondent's explanation was believable, it may have been a reasonable one. However, for the following reasons I find that the explanation tendered by the respondent is not credible and that accordingly the respondent has failed to discharge its onus of rebutting the complainant's prima facie case of discrimination.\n[46] The explanation given by the respondent has two key elements. First, that fluency in Saulteaux was a requirement for the Director of Education position. Second, that the Chief and Council rescinded the offer on July 24, 2003 as that was the date that the Chief read the Elders petition and remembered that fluency in Saulteaux was a job requirement. I find, for the following reasons, first, that the evidence supports an inference that fluency in Saulteaux was not a requirement for the position of Director of Education when Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was offered the job. Second, I find that the evidence supports an inference that the decision to rescind the job offer was made not on July 24, 2003, as the Chief testified, but earlier.\nFluency in Saulteaux not a job requirement\n[47] In finding that the evidence supports an inference that Saulteaux was not a requirement for the position of Director of Education at the time the job was offered to Ms. Bignell-Malcolm, I note first that the education policy manual does not identify that the position of Director of Education could be filled only by a person fluent in Saulteaux. In his testimony, Mr. Cochrane speculated that the omission of the language requirement likely arose because at the time of the community consultation he was the Director of Education and was fluent in Saulteaux. He was expected to hold this position for years to come and so the language requirement was overlooked. Mr. Cochrane, however, in his testimony, described his role as being in large part that of a transcriber during the community consultations. He testified that he listened to the community consultations and recorded the conclusions reached and the directions made. If the community had directed expressly that the position of Director of Education could be held only by a person fluent in Saulteaux, and if Mr. Cochrane's job was, as he described, one largely of the transcription of community directions, one would expect to find the requirement in the policy manual.\n[48] I also find it to be significant that the matter of fluency in Saulteaux as a job requirement for the Director of Education position did not arise at any time between the date Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was interviewed for the job, being in early May, 2003, and July 24, 2003, the date the Chief testified that he finally remembered the requirement and rescinded, with his Council's approval, the job offer. Surely, in all of the circumstances, the requirement would have occurred to someone earlier than July 24, 2003. First, the education policy document was published in January of 2003, just a few months before the position of Director of Education was advertised. One would expect that the content of the policy would be reasonably fresh in the minds of people in the community. Even if this Tribunal were to accept that the language requirement was improperly omitted from the job posting and the list of interview questions, it is difficult to believe that the requirement would not occur to anyone involved in the interview and candidate selection process before Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was offered the position on July 10, 2003.\n[49] I note that the interview process was undertaken by at least a dozen of the leaders of the Ebb and Flow community. The entire Board of Education was in attendance, the Chief and Council and at least one Elder. Further, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was a long time resident and active member of the Ebb and Flow community and had been employed in the school for several years. It would have been well known in the community that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm did not speak Saulteaux. I find the respondent's evidence that the language requirement did not arise because it had been improperly omitted from the job posting and the interview question list to be not credible. In all of the circumstances, it seems to me that had fluency truly been a job requirement, that requirement would have occurred to someone involved in the interview and candidate selection process and Ms. Bignell-Malcolm would not have been offered the job on July 10, 2003.\n[50] I also find it difficult to believe that two more weeks would pass by between July 10, 2003 and July 24, 2003 until the Chief finally remembered the job requirement. I find that the inference that arises on all of the evidence relevant to this element of the respondent's explanation is that fluency in Saulteaux did not arise as a job requirement for the position of Director of Education, because it was not a job requirement for the position at the relevant time.\nWhen did the respondent decide Ms. Bignell-Malcolm should not be appointed Director of Education?\n[51] I find that the evidence is most consistent with an inference that the respondent made its decision to rescind the job offer before July 24, 2003, contrary to the respondent's assertion.\n[52] Ms. Houle testified that news travels fast in the little community of Ebb and Flow. She testified that she began receiving telephone calls soon after the job was offered to Ms. Bignell Malcolm. Members of the community, she testified, were upset that Ms. Bignell Malcolm was being offered the position of Director of Education. Ms. Houle also testified that she spoke to Chief Beaulieu at the time she began receiving these calls and that he had confirmed to her that he was receiving similar telephone calls. The Chief testified that he did not recall receiving any telephone calls. I find the Chief's evidence on this point non-credible and prefer that of Ms. Houle. I believe that the Chief was well aware that members of the community were unhappy that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm had been offered the position of Director of Education shortly after the offer was made on July 10, 2003.\n[53] Further, both the respondent and the complainant agree that the meeting of July 23, 2003, a meeting at which the final details of Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's engagement were to be worked out, was acrimonious. The Chief describes that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was rude, confrontational, demanding and unreasonable right from the start of the meeting. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm denies this. One would expect that this would be a meeting at which a spirit of good-will would prevail, particularly at its beginning. Ms. Bignell-Malcolm had just been offered a job that she was to be starting in a week. Why would a person, soon to be the Director of Education, at a meeting that included members of the Board of Education, take that very opportunity to announce that she would not work cooperatively with that very Board? Why would she be rude and disrespectful? Further, if her behavior was as utterly inappropriate as described by the Chief, one would expect that the panel would have considered rescinding the offer at that time rather than to increase the salary proposal by $3,000.00 a year. I find the respondent's evidence regarding Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's behaviour to be non-credible. A more credible explanation for the acrimonious tone of this meeting is that a decision had been made by the respondent in advance of the meeting to try to encourage Ms. Bignell-Malcolm to refuse the job by offering her an unduly low salary and generally treating her poorly at the meeting.\n[54] I also find it to be significant that the petition dated July 24, 2003 and delivered to the Chief that evening carries a note at the end of the signatures: I have spoke to the other Elders in the Community, but because of the AWAKE, a lot of these Elders were not home. So, verbally they agreed to sign, but ran out of time due to the rush of this letter (sic throughout). I did not hear evidence to explain what the AWAKE was, but it appears that the AWAKE was an event that had caused some Elders to be away from their homes when the petition was being canvassed. One cannot help but wonder why the petition was undertaken so quickly after the acrimonious negotiation meeting, and why there is a reference to the shortness of time. It seems reasonable to infer that this petition was undertaken after the meeting for the purpose of fabricating a justification for the Chief and Council to rescind Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's job offer after the respondent had been unsuccessful in causing her to decline the job during the July 23, 2003 meeting. The reference to time pressure suggests that the person or persons circulating the petition knew that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm had been given only until the next day to present a written acceptance.\n[55] Further I find it to be significant that the respondent did not tell Ms. Bignell-Malcolm that the job offer was being rescinded because she was unqualified. Why would the respondent fail to disclose this reason to her? If fluency in Saulteaux was a requirement for the job; a requirement that the interview and candidate selection committee disregarded in error, one would expect that the respondent would be forthright, confess its error and tell Ms. Bignell-Malcolm that she was unqualified by reason of her lack of fluency. The respondent did not do that.\n[56] For these reasons, I find that the respondent has failed to provide a reasonable explanation for its prima facie discriminatory conduct. The evidence supports the inference that fluency in Saulteaux was not, as the respondent asserted, a requirement for the position of Director of Education at the relevant time. Further, the evidence supports an inference that the respondent decided that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm would not be the Director of Education for the Ebb and Flow School not in the evening of July 24, 2003, as the respondent asserted, but no later than the meeting of July 23, 2003. The respondent's explanation is not credible and therefore it is not reasonable. I find that the complaint has been made out on the basis of this evidence alone.\n[57] There is, in this case, further evidence that tends to suggest more directly that the respondent's conduct was based, at least in part, on a discriminatory animus. Namely, the transcript of Ms. Houle's examination for discovery and the petition, both of which were discussed earlier.\n[58] During her discovery, Ms. Houle agreed that the community had a problem with Ms. Bignell-Malcolm because she was Cree and also because she did not speak the language. During her testimony before this Tribunal, Ms. Houle stated that what she meant to say during her examination for discovery was that the Elders were concerned that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was Cree only because they would be unable to communicate with her.\n[59] I find that the transcript effectively impeaches the testimony given by Ms. Houle at the hearing of this matter. The transcript contains sworn evidence given by Ms. Houle in a proceeding undertaken before Ms. Bignell-Malcolm had filed the within complaint alleging discrimination on the ground of race and national or ethnic origin. During her examination for discovery, Ms. Houle would have had no reason but to communicate truly and accurately the concerns expressed by the Elders. For these reasons, I prefer the evidence given by Ms. Houle at her examination over the evidence given by her at the hearing. I find that this evidence supports an inference that the respondent's decision to rescind Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's offer of employment was based, at least in part, on discriminatory considerations.\n[60] I also find that the petition supports an inference of discriminatory animus. In the petition the Elders express not one, but two reasons for their objection to Ms. Bignell-Malcolm being hired as Education Director. The petition identifies a concern about her lack of fluency in Saulteaux, but a second concern expressed was that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was not one of our people. Indeed, the wording used was, . . . we would always have our own people administering our Education program. Jean does not even speak our language. This wording suggests that the Elder's primary concern was race, national or ethnic origin and that language was a secondary concern. I find that this petition is further evidence that would support an inference that the respondent's decision was based, at least in part, on a discriminatory consideration.\nThe Respondent's Alternate Defence: Aboriginal Employment Preference Program\n[61] The respondent argued that if I find that its decision was based, in whole or in part, on the consideration of race or national or ethnic origin, the decision is not discriminatory for reason of Aboriginal Employment Preference Program created by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. I find for the following reasons that the respondent cannot rely on the Aboriginal Employment Preference Program.\n[62] The Canadian Human Rights Commission has recently reviewed and updated its Aboriginal Employment Preference Program. This program is enabled by section 16 of the CHRA, which allows an employer to create a special program designed to prevent disadvantage or reduce disadvantage when the disadvantages are based on or related to a prohibited ground of discrimination, such as race, national or ethnic origin. The CHRC program directs that it is not a discriminatory practice for an employer to give preferential treatment to aboriginal persons in hiring, promotion or other aspects of employment, when the primary purpose of the employer is to serve the needs of aboriginal persons. Aboriginal preference is a defence that can be used by an employer if a complaint is made alleging a person was denied employment because they were not aboriginal.\n[63] I find that this program does not afford a defence to the respondent. First, the respondent specifically denied, in its response to Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's complaint that its decision was in any way related to her race, national or ethnic origin. The explanation provided by the respondent was that its decision was based on language alone. It is nonsensical for the respondent to insist that it did not base a decision on race, national or ethnic origin and then to argue in the alternative that if they did, they did so pursuant to a special program that had been created in the community. These positions are not alternative to one another; they are wholly inconsistent with one another.\n[64] Further, the Commission's program contemplates the employment of aboriginal persons in preference to non-aboriginal persons. The program also allows employers to require job applicants to have knowledge and\/or experience with the language, culture, history and customs of a particular First Nation, band or tribe when such requirements are directly related to the job requirements. However, the Program does not allow for preference to be given to members of a particular First Nation, band or tribe. The Commission's program strikes an important balance. The program recognizes the historic disadvantages suffered by Aboriginal persons, the importance of redressing past wrongs and of preserving the cultural heritage and autonomy of our First Nations people. The program does not, however, allow First Nations persons to discriminate against one another on the basis of their membership in a First Nation, band or tribe.\nRespondent's alternative defence: Bona Fide Occupational Requirement\n[65] The respondent has also argued in the alternative that should this Tribunal find that the respondent's decision not to hire Ms. Bignell-Malcolm was made at least in part on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, then requiring that the Director of Education have a facility in the Saulteaux language is a bona fide occupational requirement of the position of Director of Education. I find this defence has no application to the facts of this case.\n[66] Language is not coincident with and race, ethnic or national origin. Persons of Ojibway descent may or may not speak Saulteaux. Persons of Cree descent may or may not speak Saulteaux. Fluency in a particular language cannot, without more, be a bona fide occupational requirement justifying discrimination on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin.\nConclusion\n[67] For the reasons outlined above, I find that the complaint has been substantiated.\nIV. REMEDIES a) Compensation for lost wages\n[68] Ms. Bignell-Malcolm asks for compensation for lost wages from September 1, 2003 to December 31, 2006, pursuant to section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA. Section 53(2)(c) empowers a tribunal, upon having found a complaint substantiated, to compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[69] The Federal Court of Appeal has recently considered the analysis appropriate to making awards in compensation for lost wages. In Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] F.C.J. No. 1134, Pelletier J.A., writing for the Court, directs that the central consideration when considering such an award is to determine whether there exists a causal connection between the lost wages and the discriminatory act or acts. The principles that limit recovery in damage assessments in civil litigation, such as remoteness and foreseeability, have no application. A wrongdoer may be ordered to compensate its victim for losses caused by his or her conduct whether or not such losses could have reasonably been foreseen. Section 53(2)(c) gives the Tribunal discretion when considering an award in compensation for lost wages. The section directs that a tribunal may order compensation in respect of any or all wages lost as a result of discriminatory conduct, though this discretion must be exercised in a principled manner (Chopra, supra, at para. 37). Further, although a tribunal may consider whether a victim has taken steps to mitigate his or her damages, mitigation is not a mandatory consideration. Mitigation can be considered should the Tribunal view it to be appropriate in the circumstances.\n[70] Ms. Bignell-Malcolm obtained alternate employment fairly quickly after the respondent failed to hire her. She was required to find employment outside the Ebb and Flow community and to commute to and from work. The positions she obtained were less remunerative than the position of Director of Education in the Ebb and Flow School system, a position she accepted at a salary level of $55,000.00. Between September of 2003 and December of 2006, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm worked for five different employers. The only significant break in her employment was between April of 2004 and December of 2004. In April of 2004 Ms. Bignell-Malcolm testified that she decided to resign from her job at the Sioux Valley Education Authority. She testified that in the spring of 2004 she wanted to help plan her daughter's wedding. She was also very homesick and depressed. She decided that she would leave her job, move back home and set up a restaurant with her daughter. The restaurant did not succeed and was closed down by the end of December, 2004.\n[71] Between September of 2003 and December of 2006, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm earned a total income of $134,330.86. Had she been working as the Director of Education for the Ebb and Flow Indian Band during this time earning a salary of $55,000.00 per annum, she would have earned a total income of $187,916.66. I find that it is appropriate that Ms. Bignell-Malcolm receive compensation for lost wages. In respect of quantum, I order that she receive the difference between the income actually received between August 1, 2003, being the date upon which her job as Director of Education for the Ebb and Flow School system would have commenced, until December 31, 2006, except that I do not include any compensation for the months of May, 2004 through December, 2004, as Ms. Bignell-Malcolm left her job voluntarily to pursue other interests. Although the duty to mitigate is not a mandatory consideration under this head of damages, I find that it is appropriately applied here to reduce the award for lost wages.\nb) Compensation for pain and suffering\n[72] Ms. Bignell-Malcolm seeks an award, pursuant to section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA, that she receive compensation for pain and suffering. She testified that the respondent's conduct, found herein to be discriminatory, caused her significant distress. She describes trembling, and feeling like she was in shock after the Chief called late in the evening, waking her. She also testified that she suffered distress arising from the discrimination. She testified that her distress arose in part because she did not know the reasons that this job, a job that she very much wanted, had been taken from her so abruptly. She describes that she was depressed, that she suffered because she had again to leave her own community to work. She was homesick and worried about her family.\n[73] I find that the respondent's conduct caused Ms. Bignell-Malcolm to suffer serious pain and suffering. I order the Respondent to pay Ms. Bignell-Malcolm $7,000.00 in compensation for pain and suffering.\nc) Special Compensation\n[74] The complainant asks for special compensation. Section 53(3) of the CHRA empowers the Tribunal to award a maximum of $20,000.00 should the Tribunal find that a respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice either wilfully or recklessly. I find that the respondent's conduct was wilful and that it was reckless. I find that the Chief and Council rescinded Ms. Bignell-Malcolm's employment when they knew or ought to have known that they were engaging in a discriminatory practice. I find that the deceitful manner in which the job was rescinded suggests a degree of knowledge on the part of the respondent that they knew what they were doing was wrong. Special compensation is accordingly appropriate and I award $5,000.00.\nd) Legal Expenses\n[75] The complainant asks for an order directing that the respondent pay the legal expenses incurred by her during the course of this proceeding. The complainant also asks that the respondent pay the legal fees incurred during her pursuit of the wrongful dismissal law suit. Sections 53(2)(c) and 53(2)(d) both empower the Tribunal, where it finds that a complaint is substantiated, to make among other orders, an order that the respondent compensate the victim for `any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.'\n[76] Chairperson Sinclair has recently made a careful review of Federal Court jurisprudence dealing with this issue (Mowat v. Canada Post Corporation, 2006 CHRT 49). He concludes that the predominance of authority from that court is that the Tribunal has the power to award compensation for legal expenses under section 53(2).\n[77] I agree with this conclusion and am further persuaded that this Tribunal has the jurisdiction to award legal expenses for the reasons articulated by Chairperson Mactavish (as she then was) in her decision of Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 29 [Nkwazi]. Chairperson Mactavish notes that human rights legislation, given its fundamental and quasi-constitutional status is to be given a liberal and purposive construction, not only in respect to the rights protected under such statutes, but in respect of the remedial powers conferred (Nkwazi, at para. 13; see also Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at 1136; Robichaud v. The Queen, [1987] 2 S.C.R 84.)\n[78] The Federal Court of Appeal decision in Chopra does not deal expressly with the matter of legal costs. The decision deals with a claim for lost wages. The decision does, however, consider the proper interpretation of section 53(2)(c), which is one of the sections of the CHRA that confer upon this Tribunal the jurisdiction to award legal costs. Pelletier J.A. directs that the central consideration when making awards pursuant to this section is that of a causal nexus between the expenses incurred and the discriminatory conduct. Considerations such as remoteness, foreseeability have no application, and mitigation can be considered where appropriate, but is not a mandatory element of the analysis. Awards made pursuant to this section are always discretionary.\n[79] Turning first to the claim for legal costs incurred in this complaint, I find that it is appropriate to order that some of these expenses be paid. I find that the respondent's discriminatory conduct caused Ms. Bignell-Malcolm to engage the services of legal counsel. But for this discriminatory conduct, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm would not have filed this complaint and would not have reasonably sought the assistance of counsel. I find, however, that it is significant that the Canadian Human Rights Commission was represented at the hearing. Commission counsel do not represent complainants, they represent the public interest. It was perfectly reasonable for Ms. Bignell-Malcolm to engage counsel to represent her interests.\n[80] However, counsel for the Commission took an active role in examining witnesses and in closing submissions. Counsel for the complainant was of great assistance to the Tribunal, but shared much of the work during the hearing with Commission counsel. In these circumstances I find that the respondent should not be made to pay all of the complainant's legal fees. I order that the respondent will pay the reasonable legal expenses incurred by Ms. Bignell-Malcolm in her pursuit of this complaint, provided that the respondent will pay only one half of the legal expenses incurred by the complainant from October 22, 2007 to October 26, 2007, being the dates of the hearing.\n[81] Turning to the legal expenses incurred by the complainant in the wrongful dismissal action commenced by her and discussed earlier, I prefer not to exercise my discretion to order these expenses payable. It appears that the legal expenses incurred in respect of the wrongful dismissal suit were to some extent caused by the discriminatory conduct: had the respondent not rescinded the employment offer, Ms. Bignell-Malcolm would not have commenced the law suit. However, the reason that the complainant commenced a civil suit rather than a human rights complaint was not the discriminatory conduct per se, but the failure of the respondent to be frank in respect of the reasons underlying its decision. While there is some nexus between the discriminatory conduct and these legal expenses, I decline to order that the respondent compensate the complainant for these legal expenses.\ne) Other Expenses\n[82] The complainant seeks compensation for rent while working outside of her community. She claims $1,218.91 for rent while working at the Sapotewak Education Authority for three and a half months; rent in the amount of $2,200.00 paid while working at the Sioux Valley Education authority for four months, and rent in the amount of $1,500.00 paid while working in Winnipeg for six months. These claims are for living expenses incurred during the time period for which I have ordered the respondent to pay lost wages. The income earned by the complainant while working at these jobs will be deducted from her lost wage claim, and so it is reasonable that the costs associated with earning this income be paid by the respondent and I so order. I do not, however, order that the respondent compensate the complainant for her January 4, 2004 hotel bill, her cellular phone charges, a fitness club membership, furniture (that she still owns) or cable hook-up and service charges.\nf) Interest\n[83] Interest is payable in respect of all the awards made in this decision. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada, per Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. With respect to the compensation for pain and suffering and the special compensation, the interest shall run from the date of the complaint. With respect to the award for lost wages, interest will run from December 31, 2006. For legal costs, interest will run from October 26, 2007, being the last day of the hearing. Interest will be payable in respect of the other expenses from the date each expense was incurred.\nf) Retention of jurisdiction\n[84] The Tribunal will retain jurisdiction to receive evidence, hear further submissions and make further orders, if the parties are unable to reach an agreement with respect to any issues arising from the remedies ordered in the within decision. Should the parties require direction on any remedial matter they may request same within 60 days of the date of this decision.\nSigned by\nJulie C.

Hadjis\n[1] This ruling relates to the matter of the redacted documents referred to in my earlier ruling, Warman v. Lemire, 2008 CHRT 16. I have since viewed the redacted and unredacted versions of the documents and I have provided the parties with a general description of the redacted portions.\n[2] The Commission was invited to address the disclosure issues raised by the Tribunal in its ruling, by May 29, 2008, and the other parties by June 2, 2008. Only the Commission and the Respondent filed submissions.\n[3] The Commission submits that it is only required to disclose arguably relevant material, adding that personal information about individuals is not arguably relevant and that, in fact, disclosure thereof may be prohibited by the Privacy Act, R.S., 1985, c. P-21. The Respondent contends that there is no personal information to be found in the documents, particularly with regard to the names and addresses of police officials doing police work. Police, it is argued, are fully aware and expect that documents generated in their work will be subject to production and review by courts.\n[4] I view the entire issue of privacy as a proverbial red herring in this matter. The first criterion in determining what is subject to disclosure under the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure is relevance to an issue, fact or form of relief sought, as identified by any of the parties, i.e. arguably relevant, in the case. Irrespective of what any party's secondary motivation may be for excluding material from disclosure, if the material is not arguably relevant, it need not be disclosed, and accordingly, the Tribunal will have no authority to direct that such disclosure occurs.\n[5] As I already suggested in paragraph 4 of my earlier ruling, the question that must be addressed in determining the arguable relevance of this material is how the names, email addresses, phone numbers, weight and height, etc. of the individuals referred to in these documents, are arguably relevant to the proportionality test set out in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, that was the basis for the Tribunal's disclosure order in the first place.\n[6] The Respondent's submissions are not responsive to this question and are therefore not persuasive in regard to the issue at hand.\n[7] The Respondent's request that the Commission disclose the redacted portions is therefore denied.\n[8] I would note, in passing, that although the Respondent filed a written waiver from Alexan Kulbashian allowing the Commission to disclose unredacted copies of all documents which contain his private information, the fact remains that this information has not been shown to be arguably relevant to the issues of this case. Consequently, the Tribunal will not be directing that this disclosure take place.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion by the Complainants, Cathy Murphy and the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC). The Complaint involves allegations that the Respondent maintains a discriminatory policy of charging compounded interest at high rates on notional tax arrears on income received as a result of an order of this Tribunal in a pay equity case. Approximately 250,000 people received payments as a result of an order of this Tribunal on October 29, 1999.\n[2] The motion is for an order bifurcating the hearing into this matter so that the liability portion of the inquiry may be heard and determined first leaving the remedy to be heard at another hearing, if necessary. The principal reason for the request is that if the complaint is substantiated, evidence would have to be gathered from thousands of people in order to calculate the precise amount owing to the approximately 250,000 people affected by the complaint. This would require a significant amount of time and would unduly delay the hearing on liability, according to the Complainants.\n[3] The Commission supports the Complainants' request to bifurcate the hearing.\n[4] The Respondent opposes this request on the basis that it is unnecessary. In the Respondent's view, the principles governing remedy may be established at the hearing without the need to calculate the individual damages of every potential recipient. The Tribunal may address the issue of remedy by providing the framework necessary to calculate the damages for each individual. In the Respondent's view, the Tribunal could remain seized of the matter of individual damages to permit the parties to come back before the Tribunal if necessary.\n[5] The Complainants have proposed an alternative to bifurcating the hearing: instead of reserving all of the issue of remedy to a second stage, the parties would address the issue of remedy in the main part of the hearing and leave the individual calculations to be determined later, if necessary.\n[6] The Respondent consents to the alternative request. However, it says that Ms. Murphy should be required to prove her damages in the main hearing rather than revisit this issue at another hearing.\n[7] In my view, the Complainants' second request need not, and should not require a bifurcation of the hearing. The Complainants' submissions on this motion clearly indicate that although the precise quantum of damages for each individual affected by the decision would vary, the formula or calculation required to arrive at the quantum would be ascertainable and would apply to all of the approximately 250,000 individuals.\n[8] Therefore, the Respondent is correct in saying that if evidence is led about the method of calculating the individual damages, the Tribunal could make a determination on that issue and leave it to the parties to do the individual calculations. In that way, liability and remedy would be dealt with in one hearing with the Tribunal retaining jurisdiction over the issue of individual damages, should a need arise for further determination. Ms. Murphy's case may provide a useful example of how to calculate individual damages.\n[9] Complainants' counsel has indicated that although he cannot conceive of any remedy at this stage which would require a separate, individual assessment, he reserves the right, in the event that such a remedy is identified, the request that that aspect of the remedy stage be bifurcated as well. I am not sure that I understand what is meant here. However, I would reiterate that I do not see a need, based on the material that has been presented to date, to bifurcate the hearing. As I see it now, a single hearing is the most expeditious and fair means of resolving this matter.\nSigned by Karen A.

Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling about the process that will be followed to complete the inquiry into the complaint of Micheline Anne Montreuil against the Canadian Forces (CF).\n[2] Ms. Montreuil considers herself to be a transgendered person. She was born a man and went by the name of Pierre Montreuil until the mid to late 1990's when she began the medical process to become a woman. She did not complete this process.\n[3] From April of 1997 to August of 1999, the Complainant served with the CF as a male member of the First Reserve of the R\u00e9giment des Voltigeurs de Qu\u00e9bec. In 1999, the Complainant was granted a voluntary discharge from the CF. In that same year, the Complainant applied, as a female, for re-enrollment in the Canadian Forces. Her request for re-enrollment and employment with the CF was denied in 2002.\n[4] Ms. Montreuil filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission on October 23, 2002 alleging that her request for re-enrollment and employment was denied on the basis of her gender and\/or a perception that she was disabled. The CF's response was that Ms. Montreuil did not meet the medical requirements for re-enrollment, and she did not establish that the circumstances had changed since her discharge in 1999 such that she should be re-enrolled in the CF.\n[5] Tribunal Member Pierre Deschamps commenced the hearing into this matter on October 23, 2006 and completed it on December 21, 2007. On February 9, 2008 Mr. Deschamps' appointment to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ended. He was not re-appointed. The Tribunal Chairperson decided not to exercise his discretion under s. 48.2(2) of the Act to permit Mr. Deschamps to conclude the inquiry into the present case. The Chairperson assigned the case to the Vice-Chairperson of the Tribunal for case management.\n[6] On May 13, 2008, the Vice-Chairperson invited the parties to consider the possibility of a case settlement conference to discuss options for resolving the dispute. The Respondent declined the invitation. The Vice-Chairperson then requested submissions from the parties on the procedure to be followed to conclude the inquiry into this matter.\n[7] The Complainant and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) propose that the case be reheard by another member on the basis of the transcripts, documentary evidence and digital voice recordings of the evidence. If necessary, some of the witnesses can be re-called to testify as the Member sees fit.\n[8] In contrast, the Respondent is of the view that the principles of natural justice, and specifically the rule that he or she who hears must decide require that the case, in its entirety, be reheard de novo. The Respondent does not consent to a rehearing on the basis of the documentary evidence, transcripts and digital voice recordings of the hearing before Member Deschamps.\n[9] The principle he or she who hears must decide requires that anyone who takes part in a decision must have heard the evidence and the representations of the parties in the manner in which the law requires that they be heard (Doyle v. Canada (Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1985] 1 F.C. 362 (F.C.A.). This principle is a significant component of the audi alteram partem rule of natural justice (relating to the tribunal's fairness duty), and no one disputes its application in the present case (International Woodworkers of America, Local 2-69 v. Consolidated- Bathurst Packaging Ltd., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 282).\n[10] Does the principle he or she who hears must decide require a new hearing or may the matter be reheard on the basis of the previous record? The weight of judicial and tribunal authority favours a de novo hearing where one or more of the parties do not consent to a rehearing on the basis of all or part of the record of the previous hearing.\n[11] For example, in Beauregard c. Qu\u00e9bec (Commission de la function publique), 1987 CanLII 786 (Q.C. C.A.), the Quebec Court of Appeal held that it was a breach of natural justice for the Commission de la fonction publique to appoint a new commissioner to hear a wrongful dismissal complaint half way through the proceedings even though a transcript of the evidence was available.\n[12] In Moyer v. New Brunswick (Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission) 2008 NBCA 41, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal reviewed a decision of the New Brunswick Appeals Tribunal. The Appeals Tribunal heard argument on the admission of new evidence and then adjourned. When it reconvened, two of the members of the original panel had been replaced by two new members. The Court of Appeal held that it was a breach of procedural fairness for a newly composed panel to decide Mr. Moyer's case without having first alerted him to the change of composition of the panel, and then afforded him the opportunity to commence the hearing anew.\n[13] The Federal Court quashed a decision of a seven member National Parole Board in O'Brien v. Canada (National Parole Board) [1984] 2 F.C. 314, because four of the members of the Parole Board were not present at the interview. The four members based their decision exclusively on the written record. This was found to be a violation of the rule that he or she who hears must decide.\n[14] Human rights tribunals have applied this jurisprudence to decide whether they have an obligation to rehear a case de novo in the absence of consent to rehear it on the basis of the previous record. For example, in Salvadori v. British Columbia (Ministry of Health) [1996] B.C.C.H.R.D. No. 33 (Q.L.) the British Columbia Council of Human Rights decided that a hearing into the complaint of a number of doctors had to be recommenced when the member who started hearing the case was unable to continue. The evidence was recorded and transcripts of the hearing were available. However, not all of the parties were willing to proceed on the basis of the transcripts. After carefully reviewing the submissions and authorities, Member Patch concluded that proceeding with the inquiry on the basis of the transcripts of the evidence without the consent of all parties would be a violation of the rules of natural justice.\n[15] In Davis v. City of Toronto 2008 HRTO 15, the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal decided that the principle of audi alteram partem required that a new hearing be held when the member who had started the hearing was unable to finish the hearing. The only written record of the proceedings was the handwritten notes of Commission counsel and the previous member who had heard the first part of the case. The parties did not agree that the notes could be used by the new member instead of commencing the hearing de novo.\n[16] The new member stated that the case raised serious issues concerning the complainant's right to be hired as a firefighter by the City. It involved the application of human rights legislation, which has been recognized as quasi-constitutional in nature. Facts in relation to the hiring process as well as the complainant's medical condition were disputed, and the credibility of the complainant would be an issue. The new member stated that this is the type of case that is consistently dealt with by the Tribunal through an oral hearing, presided over from beginning to end by the same panel. On that basis she decided that it would be inappropriate to rely upon the hand-written notes as a record of the proceedings. She was not convinced that her resumption of the hearing partway through the evidence would be consistent with the principles of procedural fairness.\n[17] I find the Davis and Salvadori cases instructive. Like the Ontario and British Columbia Tribunals, this Tribunal has a legislative mandate to make final determinations on complaints involving quasi-constitutional rights. The Tribunal's decisions as well as its decision-making process are similar in nature to a judicial proceeding.\n[18] The Commission and the Complainant argue that given the resemblance of the Tribunal's decision-making process to that of a judicial proceeding, the Tribunal is justified in adopting the approach used by the courts and other quasi-judicial tribunals when they are in similar situations to the present.\n[19] For example, the Federal Court Rules permit the Chief Justice to replace a judge in a case with another judge and to order that the case be reheard on such terms as he or she considers appropriate (Rule 39 of the Federal Court Rules). However, to date there appears to be no case law interpreting this Rule.\n[20] Moreover, the Federal Court Rules do not provide clear legislative authority to indicate that the Tribunal, as opposed to the Federal Court, has the authority to abrogate the rules of procedural fairness. Similarly, the British Columbia Rules of Court, which were relied upon in Garbutt v. Burbank 2000 BCSC 14, and the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, which was cited in Commission de reconnaissance des associations d'artistes et des associations des producteurs (January 13, 2006, Dossier: 2000-0193 (AD) (unreported)), do not provide the Tribunal with the authority to abrogate or modify the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness without the consent of the parties.\n[21] These two cases were cited by the Commission as support for their assertion that the Tribunal could proceed with the inquiry on the basis of the transcripts without full consent of the parties. However, the case law is clear that the rules of natural justice may only be abrogated by clear legislative authority (Kane v. Board of Governors of University of British Columbia (1980), 18 B.C.L.R. 124 (S.C.C.) at 135). The rules applicable to courts in other jurisdictions do not provide the Tribunal with clear legislative authority to abrogate the rules of natural justice.\n[22] The question remains however, as to whether the Tribunal may rehear the case on the basis of some or all of the previous record provided the parties consent to this? Citing Doyle, supra, the Respondent asserts that the Tribunal is not permitted to do so. The Doyle case involved the judicial review of a report prepared by a Commission established under the Canada Corporations Act regarding allegations of fraud committed by Mr. Doyle. Mr. Doyle was not present at the hearings, but was represented by counsel for some of the proceedings. Mr. Doyle's counsel absented himself from the last part of the proceedings in protest over the manner in which the proceedings were being conducted. Mr. Doyle applied for judicial review of the report alleging that there were numerous problems with the proceedings. Among those problems was the fact two of the three persons who signed the report did not attend all the hearings. The Federal Court of Appeal found that this defect in procedural fairness to be sufficient to invalidate the report. It constituted a violation of the rule that he or she who hears must decide.\n[23] The Court of Appeal stated that the rule he or she who hears must decide affects the decision maker's jurisdiction. For that reason its violation may be invoked even by a litigant who waived his right to be heard by the court which passed judgment on him. Thus, a defendant who voluntarily declines to attend the hearing thereby waives the right to be heard; he or she does not, however, waive the right to be judged by a judge who has heard the evidence.\n[24] In the text Practice and Procedure Before Administrative Tribunals, authors Robert Macaulay and James Sprague offer the opinion that Doyle does not stand for the proposition that the principles of natural justice do not allow for a voluntary and informed choice to waive a full rehearing of the case. Rather, the case stands for the proposition that waiving the right to be heard in a matter does not constitute a waiver of the necessity that the decision-maker must have him or herself reviewed all of the evidence and argument before him or her, even though a party has elected not to put any such evidence in him or herself (at pages 22-22 - 22-24). It stands also for the proposition that waivers of aspects of the he or she who hears rule must be explicit.\n[25] Macaulay and Sprague argue that like other aspects of the audi alteram partem principles such as bias, the he or she who hears rule should be capable of waiver. They state:\nFair play is a function of the circumstances in which it is found and a breach of the he who hears rule can hardly be seen to be unfair to a party who has waived its application. I fail to see any social policy objection to an applicant voluntarily and knowingly electing to have his case judged by someone who has not personally heard all of the evidence. One might agree, for example, to have the decision-maker review transcripts of past proceedings. This latter course may be socially laudable where the delays and expenses inherent in rehearings can be avoided in cases where they serve no practical purpose. (Sprague and Macaulay, at page 22-23) (emphasis added)\n[26] I agree with the statement above. In my view, there is nothing to stop the parties from agreeing that certain portions of the transcripts may be entered as evidence. Indeed, s. 50(3)(c) of the CHRA authorizes the Tribunal to receive and accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, that the member or panel sees fit, whether or not that evidence or information would be admissible in a court of law.\n[27] In the Davis and Salvadori cases, the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal and the British Columbia Council of Human Rights emphasized that their ruling that the case must be reheard de novo did not mean that oral evidence on every aspect of the case was required if the parties agreed otherwise. The members encouraged the parties to work towards an agreement on the manner that evidence would be put before the Tribunal. In Davis, the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal stated that among the options the parties could explore were the use of the previous members' notes as the basis of a jointly produced statement of facts or evidence, or as the basis of affidavits of evidence in chief, in either case subject to the leading of evidence and cross examination on areas not agreed to. In Salvadori, Member Patch suggested that non-contentious documents and testimony from the prior hearing could be adduced through the written record of that hearing.\n[28] In the present case, it is clearly in the interests of all parties to have this matter resolved expeditiously and fairly. The hearing into this case took ninety-seven days to complete. There is no question in my mind that this case can be reheard in much less time than it took in the first hearing. It is likely that much of the testimony and many of the documents are not contentious. It may even be that the parties can agree to put the examination-in-chief testimony of the non-expert witnesses in on the basis of the transcripts and then cross-examine the witnesses viva voce. What is required is good faith effort on the part of all to come to an agreement upon the testimony and documentary evidence that is not contentious and does not need to be adduced in the same manner as previously.\n[29] The case manager will meet with the parties and assist them to attempt to reach an agreement on what parts of the evidence from the previous hearing may be adduced in the new hearing without the need for further viva voce testimony on those matters.\nKaren A.

INTRODUCTION [1] By way of introduction, it would be worthwhile to review the purpose of the Act, as well as the Tribunal's role.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended (the Act), is intended to give rise to individual rights of vital importance. Considering the powerful language of section 2, the purpose of the Act is clear. In order to promote the goal of equal opportunity for each individual to achieve the life that he or she is able and wishes to have, the Act seeks to prevent all discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted, which would deprive an individual of employment opportunities. It is the discriminatory practice itself that the Act seeks to prevent. The purpose of the Act is not to punish wrongdoing but to prevent discrimination (see: Canadian National Railway Company v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114, at paragraphs 24 and 25).\n[3] The purpose of the Act, therefore, is not to assign or punish moral blameworthiness. There is no doubt that Canadian legislation is usually drafted so as to avoid any reference to intent, evidently apart from subsection 53(3) of the Act where Parliament has provided that intent may have an impact on the compensation that the person who engages in a discriminatory practice may be ordered to pay to the victim.\n[4] In Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at page 547, the Supreme Court of Canada made its position clear regarding the purpose of such an Act, finding that its scope extends beyond intentional discrimination:\nIt is the result or the effect of the action complained of which is significant. If it does, in fact, cause discrimination; if its effect is to impose on one person or group of persons obligations, penalties, or restrictive conditions not imposed on other members of the community, it is discriminatory.\n[5] The importance of human rights legislation was recognized in Insurance Corporation of British Columbia v. Heerspink, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 145. Mr. Justice Lamer, as he then was, points out at page 158 that such legislation need not be treated as another ordinary law of general application. It should be recognized for what it is, a fundamental law. This principle was further articulated by Mr. Justice McIntyre, on behalf of a unanimous Supreme Court, in Winnipeg School Division No. 1 v. Craton, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 150, at page 156:\nHuman rights legislation is of a special nature and declares public policy regarding matters of general concern. It is not constitutional in nature in the sense that it may not be altered, amended or repealed by the Legislature. It is, however, of such nature that it may not be altered, amended, or repealed, nor may exceptions be created to its provisions, save by clear legislative pronouncement.\n[6] The case law therefore has recognized that the Act is fundamental and quasi-constitutional, so that human rights legislation prevails over other legislation (see also: Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84; Canada (Attorney General) v. Mossop, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554).\n[7] The purpose of Canadian human rights legislation is to protect against discrimination and to guarantee rights and freedoms. With respect to employment, its more specific objective is to eliminate exclusion that is arbitrary and based on preconceived ideas concerning personal characteristics which, when the duty to accommodate is taken into account, do not affect a person's ability to do a job.\n[8] In the following passage from the Report of the Commission on Equality in Employment (1984) (also called the Abella Report), at page 2 (passage referred to in Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montr\u00e9al (City); Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Boisbriand (City), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665, at paragraph 37), the Commission eloquently explained that:\nEquality in employment means that no one is denied opportunities for reasons that have nothing to do with inherent ability. It means equal access free from arbitrary obstructions. Discrimination means that an arbitrary barrier stands between a person's ability and his or her opportunity to demonstrate it. If the access is genuinely available in a way that permits everyone who so wishes the opportunity to fully develop his or her potential, we have achieved a kind of equality. It is equality defined as equal freedom from discrimination.\nDiscrimination in this context means practices or attitudes that have, whether by design or impact, the effect of limiting an individual's or group's right to the opportunities generally available because of attributed rather than actual characteristics. What is impeding the full development of the potential is not the individual's capacity but an external barrier that artificially inhibits growth.\n[9] In that legislative context, the main function of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is adjudicative. It conducts formal hearings into complaints that have been referred to it by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission). It has many of the powers of a court of justice. It is empowered to find facts, to interpret and apply the law to the facts before it, and to award appropriate remedies. Moreover, its hearings have much the same structure as a formal trial before a court. The parties before the Tribunal lead evidence, call and cross-examine witnesses, and make submissions on how the law should be applied to the facts. The Tribunal must undertake its own independent investigations of complaints: the investigative functions have deliberately been assigned by Parliament to a different body, the Commission.\n[10] The hearing before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is intended to give the Tribunal the opportunity to hear relevant evidence and arguments so that it can determine whether there has been discrimination. At the hearing, complainants have the opportunity to explain, through their evidence, how they were discriminated against and what remedy they are seeking. The respondent will have the opportunity to refute the complainant's allegations and, where applicable, to counter the claims for relief.\n[11] It is not the Tribunal's place to presume facts which should have been adduced, to make determinations on unfounded speculation or to redo counsel's work. The Tribunal takes the record as it is and makes the decision that is the fairest in light of the facts and arguments before it.\nA. LEGAL CONTEXT [12] On September 12, 2004, Magaly Germain (the complainant) filed a complaint against Groupe Major Express Inc. (the respondent). The complainant alleged that the respondent had discriminated against her in the course of employment contrary to section 7 of the Act. More specifically, the complainant alleged that the respondent discriminated against her on the basis of her pregnancy by refusing to allow her to return to work following her maternity leave. The respondent, on the other hand, argued that it did not refuse to allow the complainant to return to work, but that rather it was she who voluntarily left her employment when she accepted a position elsewhere.\n[13] Since the Supreme Court's decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 [also referred to as Meiorin], and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 [also referred to as Grismer], the classical distinction between direct discrimination and indirect discrimination has been replaced by a standardized analysis of human rights complaints. Under this analysis, the complainant must first establish prima facie evidence of discrimination.\n[14] Prima facie evidence is evidence which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. The allegations made by the complainant must be credible in order to justify the finding that there is prima facie evidence (see: Singh v. Statistics Canada, [1998] C.H.R.T. No. 7, aff'd [2000] F.C.J. No. 417 (F.C.T.D.), and Dhanjal v. Air Canada, [1997] F.C.J. No. 1599, (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37). The decision-maker need not take the respondent's answer into account in determining whether the complainant has established prima facie evidence (O'Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985], 2 S.C.R. 536, at paragraph 28; see also Dhanjal v. Air Canada, supra, at paragraph 6, and Moore v. Canada Post Corporation and Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2007 CHRT 31, at paragraph 85).\n[15] Once prima facie evidence has been established, the burden shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for the alleged conduct.\n[16] The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. According to this standard, an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (Premakumar v. Air Canada, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 3, at paragraph 81). A complainant need not establish that discrimination was the only factor influencing the conduct alleged in the complaint. The complainant need only establish prima facie evidence that discrimination was one of these factors (see: Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029).\nB. THE FACTS [17] The respondent is an interprovincial and international trucking business operating essentially in Quebec, Ontario and the United States. Daniel Gaudreau is the President. In 2002, the respondent made a proposal to its creditors under the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3. The first meeting of the creditors took place on October 18, 2002. The proposal was accepted by the creditors and went into effect on November 5, 2003. (The issue of the effect of the proposal in this matter was the subject of a preliminary decision: Germain v. Groupe Major Express Inc., 2007 C.H.R.T. 57.)\n[18] The complainant was hired by the respondent on July 1, 2002. The terms of the employment agreement were documented in writing and signed by both parties. According to this agreement, the complainant was hired as a [translation] company operations dispatcher. The agreement provided that her duties would be to assist management [translation] in the daily management of client transport needs and, more specifically, to plan client needs and the delivery service with the drivers, to oversee driver's logs and to support their needs, to verify road expenses and any other work required by management and related to dispatch.\n[19] For this work, the employment contract provided that the complainant would receive a weekly salary of $770, the equivalent of an annual salary of $40,040. The agreement, drafted by the respondent, did not provide for a probationary period or a training period. However, on cross-examination, the complainant said that [translation] on July 2, I was in `training', thereby recognizing that there was a training period at the beginning of her employment. During his examination, Mr. Gaudreau stated that when she was hired in July [translation] [the complainant] had to become familiar with the business and the drivers. The second week, she began to take control and to better understand the business and the operation of our LINK computer system. Based on this, I find that if there was a training period, it did not go beyond the first two weeks after she was hired.\n[20] Around the end of July or beginning of August 2002, the complainant learned that she was pregnant. Her due date was March 23, 2003. She said that she immediately advised her employer of this, which Mr. Gaudreau did not deny.\n[21] The first month of pregnancy was no picnic. The complainant often suffered from nausea. She said that she was not in the best physical shape. She stated that she had to miss work on several occasions at the beginning of September 2002. On September 26, 2002, her physician gave her a medical certificate stating that she would be absent from work on September 26 and 27 for health reasons. However, she did not return to work after these two days of sick leave.\n[22] On October 25, 2002, her physician issued a new medical certificate, placing the complainant off work from September 26, 2002, until she gave birth. On the certificate, the physician indicated that she had stopped working [translation] for health reasons (significant stress and insomnia incidental to her work). When she testified, the complainant stated that she was on preventative cessation of employment because of complications due to the fact that the [translation] placenta was not in place which [translation] could be dangerous for the baby. However, I note that the medical certificate did not refer to the medical condition described by the complainant and that the complainant did not file any evidence to support this statement. In any event, the respondent did not dispute this evidence.\n[23] According to the complainant, she had a good relationship with her employer until she stopped working on September 26, 2002. To support this statement, she stated that in December 2002, despite the fact that she was on medical leave, she was invited to the company's Christmas brunch. According to her, her due date was then known by the respondent, but there was no issue as to the expected date of her return to work.\n[24] The complainant gave birth as expected in March 2003. In April, she visited the respondent to show her newborn to her coworkers. She stated that it was at that time that she left a letter, dated April 14, 2003, indicating that she would be returning to work on January 12, 2004. It was also at that time that she met her replacement, Antoine Genest.\n[25] In June 2003, the complainant said that she received a call from Mr. Gaudreau, who asked her whether she would be able to return to work earlier, because he wanted to leave on vacation in July. She added that he even offered the services of his sister-in-law as a caregiver. The complainant stated that it was impossible for her to return to work at that time because her baby was only three months old and she had to breast feed.\n[26] She said that she had another conversation with Mr. Gaudreau in August 2003. At that time, Mr. Gaudreau wanted to know when she would be returning to work. She added that he was insistent that she return to work as soon as possible. She said that his insistence was stressful for her; she did not want to lose her job. She stated that she had attempted to find a caregiver for her child, but was unsuccessful. She said that she explained to Mr. Gaudreau that as long as she was unable to find a [translation] reliable caregiver, she would not be returning to work until January 2004, as originally planned.\n[27] Mr. Gaudreau had a different version of the events that occurred after the complainant gave birth. While acknowledging that she came to visit with her newborn in April 2003, he added: [translation] She called us to say that she missed her job and that she was anxious to return. She said that she would return in June if she could find a caregiver. He added that in August 2003, she called him to tell him [translation] that she knew that the company was not doing well financially. She asked whether there was a possibility that the company would close. According to Mr. Gaudreau, the complainant was concerned at that time about her job security.\n[28] The respondent added that it was not until September 2003 that it learned of the letter dated April 14, 2003, in which the complainant stated that she planned to return to work in January 2004. At the hearing, Mr. Gaudreau added that he was [translation] very surprised to see that the letter was dated April. This was wrong. It was in September that we received it and that she told us that she would be returning on January 12, 2004. We are categorical about that. I received that letter in September, not in April. She was still saying that she wanted to come back in June, that she was eager to return. When the Tribunal asked him whether he had a copy of the letter that the company had received with the date of receipt stamped on it, he answered that the respondent did not stamp the date of receipt on letters that it received. He was therefore not able to file evidence supporting his allegations to the effect that the complainant had antedated the letter.\n[29] On cross-examination, Mr. Gaudreau testified that the complainant was supposed to return to work in June 2003. He added that in June, she contacted him to ask him whether she could return to work in August or September, because she was unable to find a caregiver for her child. Finally, he added that she wrote the employer in August to advise it that she would be returning on January 12, 2004. This letter from August, if it exists, was never filed in evidence at the hearing and there was no explanation given to the Tribunal to explain why it had not been filed.\n[30] Even though he cross-examined the complainant on the contents of her letter dated April 14, 2003, the respondent's counsel never indicated that his witness, Mr. Gaudreau, would be testifying that he had not received the letter until September or that he would be alleging that the date on complainant's letter was false.\n[31] In any event, whether or not the respondent received the letter in April or, as it alleged, in September, it never told the complainant, in writing or orally, that it did not accept her return-to-work date. At least, it did not provide any evidence to that effect.\n[32] Mr. Gaudreau stated that the decision was made in September 2003 to hire a trainee to assist Antoine Genest, the complainant's replacement, because he was overwhelmed. Mr. Gaudreau added that indeed: We negotiated that if he performed well we would keep him if [the complainant] did not return.\n[33] On October 17, 2003, the complainant called Mr. Gaudreau to discuss her proposed return in January 2004. It was during this conversation that Mr. Gaudreau told her that she no longer had a place [translation] on the team and that he had hired Mr. Genest to work as a full-time dispatcher. According to the complainant, he added that he was willing to propose to her other companies where she could work.\n[34] After this conversation, the complainant said that she called the normes du travail du Qu\u00e9bec, at which time it was suggested that she write a letter to her employer to determine whether the employment ties had indeed been severed.\n[35] On October 22, 2003, the complainant sent a letter to Mr. Gaudreau confirming their conversation of October 17. In this letter, which she says was intended as a follow-up to their telephone conversation, she told her employer that she was [translation] surprised to learn . . that he had waited until September and that since she had not returned to work, he had to hire Fran\u00e7ois [the trainee] because [he] could no longer manage `dispatch'. The complainant added in her letter that she had asked Mr. Gaudreau whether she [translation] still had a place with the company and that he had answered [translation] that his team of dispatchers was now complete [and] that he could no longer guarantee her a position. She said that he added that [translation] it would be preferable that she begin to seek [new] employment. The complainant wrote that she had asked Mr. Gaudreau whether he had intended to wait until January 10 to tell her that she no longer had a job, to which he responded, once again according to the letter, that he [translation] no longer had her phone number.\n[36] She also wrote in her letter that the employer had told her that her replacement's salary was $39,000 per annum, which was less than the salary that it had paid her and that this in itself justified its decision to [translation] no longer guarantee her position. She wrote: What you are forgetting is that maternity leave exists so that the mother can devote all of her time and energy to her newborn. However, in this situation, I will spend the last two and a half months of my leave worried and insecure and probably looking for another job because during this same conversation you made me feel as though you could not guarantee me a quality of life at work equivalent to the one I had before I left.\n[37] Finally, she asked her employer to confirm in writing before November 5, 2003, that she could return to her work in January 2004, in the same position and with the same salary. The respondent did not respond to the complainant's letter.\n[38] On cross-examination, the complainant stated that she had sent this letter to the respondent by registered mail. During his testimony, Mr. Gaudreau said that he did not recall receiving this letter. When asked by the respondent's counsel to file a copy of the postal receipt confirming the letter had been sent, the complainant gave him a document which appeared to have satisfied counsel since he did not continue that line of questioning. During the final submissions, the respondent did not revisit this point.\n[39] Unfortunately, the postal receipt was not filed into evidence and the Tribunal therefore could not examine it. However, I am persuaded that if there had been a problem with the document, the respondent's counsel would not have hesitated to file it and, as he did not do so, I can only infer that this confirms that the letter had indeed been sent.\n[40] As she did not receive a response from the employer, the complainant said that she began to look for work. On November 3, 2003, she was hired by a company by the name of Royal Wood Shavings for which she had worked before the respondent had hired her. The date she was hired for this new employment is somewhat surprising, considering that in her letter dated October 22, she had given her employer until November 5 to confirm whether or not it would let her return to her position in January 2004. She explained that she had decided to look for work, because she knew that it would be difficult to find work in Qu\u00e9bec City in January.\n[41] According to Mr. Gaudreau, on November 2, he called Royal Wood Shavings, one of the respondent's clients, and [translation] to his great surprise the complainant answered the telephone. He added: [translation] I asked her: What are you doing there? If you wanted to return to work, why didn't you return to us? All that she said to me was that Groupe Major Express was not secure. She was not sure whether or not we would remain open. I saw that [the complainant] was not interested in Groupe Major Express. A little later on, he added: [translation] The conversation did not affect me. I was rather surprised that she was there. We did not know that she was there. As far as we were concerned, she was still ill, she was looking for a caregiver. I knew nothing of her efforts to find work elsewhere. She had never been dismissed. We were surprised to see . . . we wanted to know why she had gone to work elsewhere. We had been waiting for her at Groupe Major Express for more than a year at that point. To follow up on this conversation with the complainant and, faced with the [translation] uncertainty of her return, Mr. Gaudreau said that he decided to confirm that Mr. Genest would be given permanent status as head dispatcher.\n[42] During her testimony, the complainant did not refer to a telephone conversation that she allegedly had with Mr. Gaudreau in the beginning of November 2003. I also observe that the respondent's counsel did not question the complainant regarding this conversation.\n[43] Mr. Gaudreau also referred to another conversation that he had allegedly had with the complainant in December 2003. According to Mr. Gaudreau, the complainant had called him to tell him that she wanted to return to work on January 12, 2004. He says that he told her that [translation] she had to make up her mind. You are working at `Royal Wood Shavings.' Are you coming back or not?\n[44] According to the complainant, the conversation to which Mr. Gaudreau referred did not take place in December 2003, but rather in January 2004. According to her, Mr. Gaudreau called her to ask her to come back to work for the respondent. Also according to the complainant, he offered her a different position with a salary of $23,000, which was much less than what she was earning before her maternity leave. He also told her she would no longer be working as head dispatcher. In the complainant's opinion, this offer was unacceptable because even in terms of salary she was earning more at Royal Wood Shavings, where her salary was $27,000. She stated that she asked Mr. Gaudreau to send her the offer in writing, adding that in any event [translation] she was pregnant once again.\n[45] The complainant added that she never did receive a written confirmation of the offer that Mr. Gaudreau made to her in January 2004. She added that she had also never followed up on this conversation because she [translation] did not take the offer seriously.\n[46] Mr. Gaudreau did not deny that he had called the complainant at home, although his testimony on this point was somewhat confused: [translation] I called [the complainant] at home. She had called to find out whether her job was still available for January 12. I told [the complainant] that given your experience we would make her an offer. We offered her $30,000 per annum. The young man [trainee] was earning $27,000. She had more experience than him so I gave her a raise [sic]. At the end of three months we would see. She never talked about putting it in writing. She said okay, I'll call you back. She called me back 15 minutes later to tell me that she refused my offer. You give me $40,000 a year or I will not come back. I told her that I could not pay her $40,000 a year. I asked her to do her three months of `training'. You did not even finish your first month. I have not finished showing you the `job'. She categorically refused. She hung up on me. She called back and said she wanted $40,000. I said no, I cannot give you $40,000 and I cannot let you have the position you had before, because you do not have the experience to do it. She refused and said that, in any event, I am pregnant again and she hung up on me.\n[47] On cross-examination, he added that following this conversation her refusal [to accept his offer] liberated us.\n[48] After their conversation in January, Mr. Gaudreau called the complainant back in May or June 2004. According to the complainant, he wanted to know how she planned to repay the $1,500 that the employer had paid her when she left on maternity leave. In fact, the employer had at that time paid the complainant three weeks of salary, two of which were to be reimbursed by the Commission de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail du Qu\u00e9bec (the CSST), at least according to what the parties believed at the time. However, since the respondent was a federal undertaking, the CSST refused to reimburse the employer. In an agreement dated January 7, 2003, the complainant undertook to repay this amount in increments of $100 per week for 15 weeks upon her return to work after her maternity leave. According to the complainant she told her employer during their conversation in June 2004 that she did not at that time have the means to pay back this amount. The issue was finally settled in an arbitral award dated March 3, 2005, in a proceeding under Division XVI of Part III of the Canada Labour Code involving the same two parties.\nC. APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS (i) Credibility of the witnesses [49] The complainant has the initial burden of proof to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Once this initial burden has been met, the respondent must then provide a justification or an explanation for the alleged discriminatory practice. In this case, the evidence filed by the parties was limited to the complainant's testimony and the testimony of Mr. Gaudreau, for the respondent. As expected, these witnesses did not have the same recollections or the same interpretation of relevant events. On many points, their testimony was contradictory, forcing me to choose whose testimony was the most credible, which is never an easy task.\n[50] Even though her testimony was not free of inconsistencies and ambiguities, on the issue of credibility I tend to prefer the evidence submitted by the complainant for the reasons that follow. Inter alia, the complainant supported many of her claims with evidence in writing. For example, she submitted in evidence a letter dated April 14, 2003, informing her employer that she would not return to work until January 2004. On the other hand, on this point the respondent's witness made only an unfounded statement to the effect that the date of this letter had been falsified and that, in any event, he had not received it until August or September 2003. However, he did not file the copy of the letter received by his company and, when I asked whether the respondent had in its possession a letter with a stamp indicating the date of receipt, he answered that the respondent did not stamp the dates of receipt on the letters it received. This explanation did not persuade me and indeed it did not explain why the letter of August or September 2004 had never been filed.\n[51] I also observed that, during the complainant's cross-examination, the respondent's counsel did not really question her about the substance of this letter and in particular he did not draw her attention to the fact that his witness was going to testify that he had not received the letter in April and that he was indeed going to impugn the date indicated on the letter. On this point, I note that the rule established in Browne v. Dunn (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L.), requires counsel to warn witnesses that counsel later intends to impugn their credibility, unless witnesses have already been notified that their credibility will be challenged. The justification for this rule was explained as follows by Lord Herschell, at pages 70-71, of the decision:\nNow, my Lords, I cannot help saying that it seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that the imputation is intended to be made, and not to take his evidence and pass it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit. My Lords, I have always understood that if you intend to impeach a witness you are bound, whilst he is in the box, to give him an opportunity of making any explanation which is open to him; and, as it seems to me, that is not only a rule of professional practice in the conduct of a case, but is essential to fair play and fair dealing with witnesses. Sometimes reflections have been made upon excessive cross-examination of witnesses, and it has been complained of as undue; but it seems to me that a cross-examination of a witness which errs in the direction of excess may be far more fair to him than to leave him without cross-examination, and afterwards to suggest that he is not a witness of truth, I mean upon a point on which it is not otherwise perfectly clear that he has had full notice beforehand that there is an intention to impeach the credibility of the story which he is telling.\n(See also: R. v. Lyttle, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193 and Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd ed., LexisNexis Butterworth, pages 954-957.)\n[52] Furthermore, although in certain respects the complainant's testimony was somewhat inconsistent, I found her testimony far more credible overall than the testimony of the respondent's witness.\n[53] In regard to the telephone conversation of October 17, 2003, the complainant filed in evidence a letter dated October 22, 2003, confirming the substance of the discussions that she had allegedly had with Mr. Gaudreau. Mr. Gaudreau did not deny receiving this letter, even though he said that he did not remember it. I also observe that during the complainant's cross-examination, the respondent's counsel asked to see the postal receipt confirming that the letter had been sent by registered mail. After reviewing this document, Mr. Jobidon did not ask the witness any other question on this point, and did not ask that the receipt be filed in evidence. I find on this basis that the document confirmed that the letter was sent on or about the date indicated. I also find that the content of the letter faithfully reflects the conversation that took place between these two individuals, since it was not challenged by the respondent.\n[54] When he testified, Mr. Gaudreau referred to two conversations that he had with the complainant in November and December 2003. The complainant never referred to these conversations and she was never cross-examined about them. According to Mr. Gaudreau, it was during this conversation in November that he learned that the complainant was working at Royal Wood Shavings. He added that following this conversation, he decided to confirm the permanent status of Mr. Genest, the complainant's replacement, as head dispatcher. Then Mr. Gaudreau's testimony became difficult to follow. According to him, the complainant contacted him again in December 2003 to tell him that she was still interested in returning to work for the respondent in January 2004. Mr. Gaudreau told her that [translation] she had to make up her mind. You are working at `Royal Wood Shavings'. Are you coming back or not? If the respondent had learned at the beginning of November that the complainant had accepted employment elsewhere and if this had prompted the confirmation of Mr. Genest's position as head dispatcher, as Mr. Gaudreau stated, why then would he in December again have discussed the possibility of her returning to work?\n[55] On cross-examination, Mr. Gaudreau explained that he had [translation] agreed to take back the complainant even though Mr. Genest had just been given permanent status. He added that the second dispatcher position was still available [translation] because we decided to lay off the second dispatcher [the trainee] to replace him with the [complainant]. Why then would he act this way when already in November 2003 he considered that the complainant had left her job? According to Mr. Gaudreau, the decision to dismiss the [translation] trainee from the position of [translation] second dispatcher on December 22, 2003, was made because of the complainant's possible return. Accordingly, this conversation, if it took place, must have taken place before December 22, 2003, the date that the trainee was relieved of his duties. In that case, why did Mr. Gaudreau not inform the complainant at that time that the respondent was not going to take her back as head dispatcher, especially since he had already confirmed that Mr. Genest was head dispatcher?\n[56] The chronology of the events as presented by Mr. Gaudreau is difficult to follow. Even though he had spoken with the complainant about her possible return during a telephone conversation in December 2003, it appears that he did not tell her that the business was [translation] reviewing employees' salaries because of financial difficulties until a conversation in January 2004. He even stated that all [translation] the salaries were decreased by 15%. He added that during this conversation: [translation] [The complainant] was told that we would take her back, but that we would renegotiate her salary, because the business could not pay two salaries of $40,000. Fran\u00e7ois [the trainee] left on December 22. The complainant called back on January 10 and asked if the work was ready. I told her that yes, we are ready to have you back. Given the training that you were unable to complete at the beginning of your employment, given your lack of experience, we will put you on as second dispatch behind Antoine who at this time has one year of experience. We cannot appoint you as head dispatcher with only two weeks of training. In 2003, we had 30 trucks and not 20 as we had when she began.\n[57] When Mr. Gaudreau stated that the business [translation] could not pay two salaries of $40,000, he was clearly referring to the fact that Antoine Genest was now employed as head dispatcher and that he received a salary of $40,000. Yet on cross-examination, he stated that [translation] [Antoine Genest] was employed as a dispatcher until September 2004. He left the employment for health reasons. He knew from the beginning that it was a temporary position, but because we did not know when [the complainant] was coming back, it was extended [emphasis added]. Therefore, Mr. Genest had to fill this position on a temporary basis until the complainant's return. The respondent therefore had not originally intended to employ him on a permanent basis; it had asked him to replace the complainant during her maternity leave. When Mr. Genest was hired, there was also no issue about the complainant having failed to complete her training period.\n[58] Mr. Gaudreau did not deny that he had called the complainant at home in January 2004, even though his testimony was somewhat confused: [translation] I called [the complainant] at home. It was she who called to ask whether her job would still be there on January 12. He contradicted himself from one sentence to the next, first stating that he called the complainant, then immediately adding that it was the complainant who called him. According to the substance of this conversation, set out above, the respondent wanted to renegotiate the complainant's salary, claiming that she had not completed her training. The employment contract did not provide for any training period, or for a salary decrease in the event of prolonged absence.\n[59] On cross-examination, Mr. Gaudreau added an interesting comment: [translation] Her refusal liberated us. I interpret this remark as an indication that as of that moment the respondent considered the employment ties with the complainant to be severed. This statement is surprising to say the least in light of his earlier testimony to the effect that he had decided to confirm Mr. Genest's employment as head dispatcher, the position that the complainant had held, following his conversation with the complainant in November 2003. When Mr. Gaudreau confirmed Mr. Genest's employment, he was aware of the fact that the complainant was still expecting to return to work for the respondent. It appears now that it was the complainant's refusal to accept a different position at a lower salary in January 2004 rather than the conversations of November and December 2003 that was [translation] liberating.\n[60] For all of these reasons, I do not assign much credibility to the testimony of the respondent's witness and where this testimony is inconsistent with the complainant's testimony, I prefer the complainant's testimony.\n(ii) The maternity leave [61] Although pregnancy is not an accident or an illness and is often a condition that is desired, it is undisputable that it is a valid health ground for leave from employment. For the employee, the economic consequences of the inability to perform the tasks involved in the employee's work are the same, regardless of whether this inability is the result of a pregnancy or another health ground resulting in leave from employment. The failure to consider pregnancy in this way is contrary to one of the purposes of anti-discrimination legislation, namely the removal of unfair disadvantages which have been imposed on individuals or groups in society (see section 2 of the Act which refers to the right to be equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have). Further, we can consider this disadvantage as a disadvantage imposed on women, because they are the only ones capable of giving birth. Indeed, Parliament codified this observation at subsection 3(2) of the Act which provides specifically that [w]here the ground of discrimination is pregnancy or child-birth, the discrimination shall be deemed to be on the ground of sex.\n[62] It also indicates that in finding that women, following childbirth, are not entitled to maternity leave without deleterious effects on their employment, we undermine the objectives of anti-discrimination legislation by sanctioning one of the most significant ways in which women have been disadvantaged. It would sanction imposing a disproportionate amount of the costs of pregnancy upon women. Removal of such unfair impositions upon women and other groups in society is a key purpose of anti-discrimination legislation (see Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219, at paragraphs 28 and 29).\n[63] The purpose of maternity leave is not to encourage family formation. It is rather to protect the health and well being of pregnant women and new mothers. It goes without saying that pregnancy and giving birth are very stressful on the health of new mothers. Maternity leave is intended to allow them to recover, so that they can reasonably effectively return to the work force (see B.C. Government and Service Employees Union v. British Columbia (2002), 216 D.L.R. (4th) 322, at paragraph 17, as interpreted in Tomasson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 F.C.A. 265).\n[64] In the case before us, the complainant was on parental leave when her employer advised her in October 2003 that she no longer had a place with its company and that she had to seek employment elsewhere. Although it is true that in January 2004, the employer offered a position to the complainant, that position was not the one that she had before going on sick leave as a result of her pregnancy. The employment that was offered to her by the employer was a demotion with a substantially lower salary.\n[65] From all of the evidence filed before me, I find that the complainant established a prima facie case of discrimination against her by the respondent based on her pregnancy in refusing to let her return to work, in the same position and at the same salary, following her maternity leave and her parental leave.\n[66] The burden is now on the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation of the impugned conduct. The respondent did not file evidence to satisfy this burden. First, it offered an explanation to the effect that the complainant had accepted employment elsewhere in November 2003. Later, it explained that it was prepared to employ the complainant in January 2004, but in another position and a lesser salary since she had not completed her training and her replacement was more experienced. Yet, as we saw earlier, this explanation was not persuasive and contradicted the evidence filed by the complainant. The incomplete and inconsistent evidence filed by the respondent prompts me to find that it failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the impugned conduct.\n[67] I therefore find that Ms. Germain's complaint against her employer, Groupe Major Express Inc., is founded.\nD. RELIEF [68] In terms of the relief sought by the complainant, I must tackle the same problem that I had when I made the decision on the merits based on the respondent's evidence, but this time it is the complainant's evidence that is far from satisfactory and conclusive. What follows is therefore a summary of the evidence filed before me.\n[69] The complainant is not seeking reinstatement with the respondent's team. She is claiming, however, the salary that she says that she lost as a result of her dismissal. I observe however that there was no concrete evidence filed to support this claim.\n[70] At best, she filed her employment history from November 2003. So, from November 2003 until March 2004, the complainant worked for Royal Wood Shavings. In March 2004, her physician put her on preventative cessation of employment because of her pregnancy. On August 25, 2004, she birth to her second child. Following her maternity leave, she did not return to work for Royal Wood Shavings. She explained that she had just separated from the father of her second child and since he also worked for Royal Wood Shavings, she was not comfortable returning there.\n[71] After leaving Royal Wood Shavings, she said that she worked, as of September 2005, for three months, for a transport brokerage named Voyageur 2000. She added that it was full-time employment and that she received a salary of $35,000 per annum. She explained that she left this employment because she had to leave the family household and return to live with her mother as a result of her recent separation.\n[72] Since she had exhausted her employment insurance during her maternity leave, she said that she received social assistance for the period following her departure from Voyageur 2000. In July 2006, she went to work for Saint-Lambert Transport, a transport brokerage. Finally, on November 20, 2006, she found part-time employment with FEDEX. Although she said that she is still working for FEDEX, she added that she has been on parental leave since March 2, 2008, because she is due on June 16, 2008. Further, she stated that she stopped working in September 2007.\n[73] I cannot, based on this incomplete evidence, find that the complainant lost salary and I will therefore not make any order to that effect.\n[74] The complainant is also claiming $20,000 in compensatory damages under paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act, arguing that the respondent's conduct deprived her of three months of maternity leave. She stated that she had to find a caregiver in a panic in November because she had to find work and that her life was [translation] turned upside down, at the same time causing her some stress.\n[75] The evidence filed at the hearing in support of this claim appears to me to be meagre to say the least and certainly insufficient to justify the amount claimed by the complainant which is the maximum provided under the Act. This evidence is limited to the complainant's testimony to the effect that she had been affected by the respondent's conduct (see Transport Jeannot Gagnon v. Dumont 2002 FCT 1280).\n[76] However, I agree that the respondent's conduct caused pain and suffering to the complainant, if only in terms of anxiety. I therefore award compensation in the amount of $3,500 for pain and suffering.\n[77] The complainant is also claiming an amount for the reimbursement of her legal fees. In support of this claim, she filed a contingency fee agreement that she had signed with her counsel. I cannot on the basis of this evidence allow the complainant's claim. A contingency fee agreement cannot be considered as evidence of the fees that the complainant must pay to counsel.\n[78] The interest on the $3,500 awarded as relief is payable in accordance with subsection 53(4) of the Act. It must be calculated in accordance with subsection 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) at simple interest on an annual basis awarded at the bank rate set by the Bank of Canada. Interest shall run from the date of the complaint to the date of the payment of the compensation.\nSigned by Michel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJuly 25, 2008\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T1179\/6106\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Magaly Germain v.

Grant Sinclair Date: August 1, 2008 Citation: 2008 CHRT 34\n[1] The complainant, Public Service Staff Relations Board Pay Equity Employees Association, filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission on November 27, 2001, under ss. 10 and 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The respondents are Treasury Board of Canada (TB) and the Public Service Staff Relations Board (PSSRB).\n[2] The complainant now brings a motion to the Tribunal asking that the Tribunal adjourn its proceeding, pending the release of the decision of the Federal Court in the action Public Service Alliance of Canada et al v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.\n[3] The PSAC action was filed in the Federal Court on November 8, 2000. PSAC\u2019s claim is on behalf of employees of seven separate government employers or agencies who were not provided with the same wage rates and benefits given to TB employees as a result of the July 29, 1998 Tribunal pay equity decision and the November 16, 1999 Tribunal Consent Order. PSAC alleges that the failure to do so violates s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[4] The complainant Association and the respondents, TB and PSSRB, are not parties in the Federal Court action. The PSSRB is a separate employer under the Public Service Staff Relations Act.\n[5] It appears from the materials filed, that the main, if not the only issue in the PSAC action is, who is the employer of the employees of the seven separate employers\/agencies.\n[6] The complainant argues in its motion that the determination of this issue in the PSAC action will be persuasive, serve to narrow the issues before the Tribunal and could even potentially avoid the need for a Tribunal hearing. This is so, says the complainant because the interpretation of employer is the threshold issue in the PSAC action and in the complaint before the Tribunal.\n[7] The complainant provides no explanation as to why this is the threshold issue for the Tribunal and it is unclear why this is so. But, even assuming this to be so, the complainant\u2019s stated position before the Tribunal in pre-hearing case management sessions is that if PSAC action is unsuccessful in the Federal Court, it will still proceed with the complaint before the Tribunal. Similarly, the respondents\u2019 stated position is to proceed before the Tribunal even if PSAC is successful in its Federal Court action.\n[8] More to the point, the jurisprudence of the Tribunal is very clear with respect to requests to adjourn Tribunal proceedings. The Tribunal decisions in Leger v. Canadian National Railways and Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service state that a Tribunal, when exercising its discretion to adjourn, should do so when demanded by principles of natural justice. Some examples which could be persuasive to an adjournment, are delay in bringing the complaint; the unavailability of witnesses or evidence; the need to obtain counsel; late disclosure, all of which would prejudice a party\u2019s ability to make full representation before the Tribunal. Within this jurisprudence, there is nothing in the complainant\u2019s motion that would support an adjournment.\n[9] The fact that the Tribunal has not proceeded to hearing in Thwaites et al, Boyes et al, Adamson et al, Bakker et al and Delf v. Air Canada and Air Canada Pilots Association is not helpful to the complainant. These complaints raise the very issues that were decided by the Tribunal in Vilven & Kelly v. Air Canada and Air Canada Pilots Association, which decision is now before the Federal Court on judicial review. The facts in the complainant\u2019s motion are totally dissimilar.\n[10] The PSAC action is scheduled for October 2008, to run for 40 days. That, plus the time for a decision (assuming no appeals) means that the Tribunal hearing could be delayed for another year. The result would be no Tribunal hearing for at least eight years after the complaint was filed. Certainly, this is not in conformity with the Tribunal\u2019s mandate that proceedings before the Tribunal be done expeditiously.\n[11] As noted in Leger and Baltruweit, the appropriate forum to stay the Tribunal hearing is the Federal Court. The motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ.

The Respondents countered that the documents were subject to litigation privilege.\n[2] I deferred resolution of the issue to the hearing, stating that I would provide a ruling if and when that became necessary. During the hearing, Complainant counsel requested that I issue a ruling before the witness who was called as an expert by the Respondents was to testify. They asserted that I did not have to wait until the cross-examination of the witness to do so but rather, could order the production of the documents forthwith.\n[3] For the reasons provided below I determined that there was no right to the automatic production of the expert's files once the witness had been called to testify, as contended by the Complainants. Rather, I held that the Tribunal should inspect the documents to determine whether litigation privilege had been waived or not, and if so to order the production of the documents. I provided a summary of my reasons orally. The following constitute the written reasons that I told the parties that I would provide. Should there be any inconsistencies between my oral reasons and the present reasons, the present reasons are to prevail.\nI. Issue One: Does the Tribunal have Jurisdiction to Inspect the Documents? [4] In Blood Tribe (Department of Health) v. Canada (Privacy Commissioner) 2008 SCC 44 334, the Supreme Court held that the Privacy Commissioner did not have the jurisdiction to inspect documents over which a claim of solicitor-client privilege had been asserted. The Court stated that express language is required to abrogate solicitor-client privilege because it is presumptively inviolate (Blood Tribe at para. 26).\n[5] The issue in the present case is different from that in the Blood Tribe case. Here we are dealing with litigation privilege. As the Supreme Court noted in Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2006 SCC 39, litigation privilege and solicitor-client privilege are two very different legal constructs; they are driven by different policy considerations and generate different legal consequences. Therefore, I do not think that the reasoning in Blood Tribe applies to the present case.\nII. Issue Two: Is Litigation Privilege Over the Expert's File Automatically Waived Once the Expert is Called to Testify? [6] Litigation privilege means that documents prepared for the dominant purpose of litigation, including expert reports, do not have to be revealed to adverse parties unless the privilege is waived: Blank, supra. However, normally the party who commissioned an expert report will waive the litigation privilege, and file the report in court. Once the privilege is waived, adverse parties are entitled to see the report as well as other documents in the expert's file. (Lax Kw'alaams Indian Band v. Canada (Attorney General) 2007 BCSC 909)\n[7] Canadian courts have taken different approaches to determining the scope of litigation privilege waiver. The Respondents assert that by operation of sections 2 and 40 of the Canada Evidence Act, the Tribunal is obliged to apply the law in Ontario. Section 40 of the Canada Evidence Act stipulates that in all proceedings over which Parliament has legislative authority, the laws of evidence in force in the province in which those proceedings are taken apply to those proceedings.\n[8] I am not sure that it can be said that the proceedings were taken in Ontario. To be sure, Ms. Walden filed her complaint in Ontario, but she is not the only complainant in this matter. There are approximately 400 other Complainants who reside and work in cities across Canada. The events giving rise to the complaints occurred in more than one province.\n[9] The parties reached an agreement whereby all Complainants, other than Ms. Walden, were considered to have filed a complaint when they contacted a regional representative Complainant who put their name on a Complainant list. Otherwise, the Complainants would likely have filed individual complaints in the Commission's regional offices throughout Canada.\n[10] It must also be recognized that the proceedings in issue are of an administrative nature and the initiating documents (the complaints) were not filed at a local court house, but rather with a federal agency (the Commission) which has a national mandate. Moreover, the Commission's requests for the institution of an inquiry are made to the Tribunal, which also has a national mandate.\n[11] In light of the foregoing facts, it is virtually impossible to identify a single province as being the locus of the proceedings. For this reason, while reliance must be placed on jurisprudence from provincial superior courts, the law of evidence of one province cannot be readily excluded in favour of the law of another. Moreover, a review of the case law cited by the parties together with related precedents suggests that a consensus on the state of the law in a given province is not always discernable. For these reasons, I have decided not to limit my review of the law to the Ontario jurisdiction.\n[12] There are at least two approaches in Canada to the waiver of litigation privilege: one favours greater production, and the other leans toward a more narrow view of the waiver of litigation privilege.\n[13] The case of Vancouver Community College v. Phillips, Barratt (1987), 20 B.C.L.R. (2d) 289 is an example of the approach favouring greater production. In that case, the British Columbia Supreme Court held that the exception to litigation privilege extends broadly to all documents in the witness's possession which are relevant to the preparation or formulation of the opinions offered, as well as to his or her consistency, reliability, qualification and other matters touching on the witness's credibility (see also: Jesionowski v. Gorecki [1992] F.C.A. no. 816; Browne (Litigation Guardian of) v. Lavery [2002] O.J. No. 564 (S.C.)\n[14] Not all courts have been willing to construe the waiver of litigation privilege so broadly. For example, in Bell Canada v. Olympia and York Developments Ltd. (1989), 68 O.R. (2d) 103 (H.C.J.) the court dealt with a motion to compel an expert to produce all correspondence between himself and the instructing solicitor. The court refused to order such production stating that to do so would jeopardize solicitor and client privilege. In doing so, the court refused to apply the reasoning in Vancouver Community College, supra (see also: Edmonton (City) v. Lovat Tunnel Equipment Inc. 2000 ABQB 182; R. v. 1278481 Ontario Ltd. 2007 NLTD 151; Highland Fisheries Ltd. V. Lynk Electric Ltd. (1989), 63 D.L.R. (4th) 493 (N.S. S.C.); Martin v. Inglis 2002 SKQB 24)\n[15] I think that the approach taken by the British Columbia Supreme Court to the common law on litigation privilege and waiver in Lax Kw'alaams Indian Band v. Canada (Attorney General) 2007 BCSC 909 represents a balanced approach to addressing the issue. That case involved a request to have the working files of three expert witnesses for the defense resource biologists produced. The files included draft reports, communications between counsel and the experts as well as other reports.\n[16] The Court stated:\nI do not think that the statements by Finch J., as he then was, in Vancouver Community College v. Phillips, Barratt regarding exceptions to the waiver of litigation privilege can be taken as blanket exceptions which will apply in all cases regardless of the circumstances. He was citing examples where exceptions may occur, but the principle he was espousing was that the court must balance the competing policies of disclosure versus privilege and determine what is fair in each particular case (Lax Kw'alaams Indian Band, supra, at para 15).\n[17] In determining whether litigation privilege has been waived, the decision maker should have regard to the following principle: when an expert witness who is not a party is called to testify, or when his or her report is tendered in evidence, he or she may be required to produce documents in his or her possession which are or may be relevant to matters of substance in his or her evidence or credibility, unless it would be unfair or inconsistent to require such production.\n[18] The British Columbia Supreme Court resolved the dispute by examining the documents to determine if litigation privilege applied. The Court held that some of the documents were to be disclosed because they went to the substance of the opinion or the credibility of the witness but not all of them. (see also: Pich\u00e9 et als v. Lecours Lumber Co. Ltd. et al (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 193 in which the Ontario Court (General Division) used a similar approach to resolving claims of litigation privilege, albeit applying a different test.)\n[19] It should also be noted that a number of courts that have employed an approach similar to that of the court in Lax Kw'alaam Indian Band, supra, have relied upon a passage from Sopinka and Lederman's text on The Law of Evidence in Canada in which the authors comment on the Vancouver Community College by stating:\nAs to the expert's credibility, caution should be exercised before that becomes the basis for wide-ranging disclosure of all solicitor-expert communications and drafts of reports. In any event, it might just lead to a general practice among solicitors of destroying drafts after they are no longer needed just to avoid the problem. (Sopinka and Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Canada (2nd ed.) at p. 763, cited in Martin v. Inglis, supra, at para. 10)\n[20] I think that these comments are important to bear in mind when assessing whether litigation privilege has been waived over documents in the expert's possession.\n[21] The Respondents were asked to provide me with copies of the documents over which litigation privilege is asserted. I stated that I would review them to determine whether the privilege has been waived having regard to the principles set out above.\nSigned by\nKaren Jensen\nOTTAWA, Ontario August 8, 2008\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T1111\/9205, T1112\/9305 and T1113\/9405\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Ruth Walden et al. v.

Jensen\n[1] The Respondent, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de l'Outaouais (STO), has asked the Tribunal to add the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission (OC Transpo) and the Attorney General of Quebec (the A.G.Q.) as respondents in Bob Brown's complaint against the STO. The Canadian Human Rights Commission, OC Transpo and the A.G.Q. oppose the request.\n[2] Mr. Brown is a quadriplegic and uses a wheelchair for mobility. He lives in Ottawa's downtown core. During Ottawa's winter festival (Winterlude) in 2005, he was unable to board an STO bus going to an event in Jacques Cartier Park in Gatineau, Quebec because the STO bus was not wheelchair accessible. He complained to the Canadian Human Rights Commission that STO had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability.\n[3] In 2005, the STO and OC Transpo had an agreement to share the provision of bus services for Winterlude events. The events took place in both Ottawa and Gatineau, Quebec, which is just across the river from Ottawa. OC Transpo states that the buses it made available during Winterlude 2005 were low-floor buses which were accessible to persons with disabilities. The STO states that the buses it used at this time were not wheelchair accessible. The STO provided an adapted transit service which was not available to Mr. Brown because he is not a resident of Quebec. However, OC Transpo's adapted bus service was available to Mr. Brown.\n[4] The Tribunal has the jurisdiction to add parties. However, the discretion to do so should be exercised cautiously and only when necessary to resolve the complaint (Smith v. CNR 2005 CHRT 23; Desormeaux v. OC Transpo (oral ruling: October 2, 2002 (T701\/0602)); Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-t\u00e9l\u00e9phone v. Telus Comunications 2003 CHRT 31).\nThe Addition of OC Transpo as a Respondent\n[5] The STO argues that OC Transpo's participation as a party is necessary for the resolution of the complaint. Given that the bus services were jointly offered by the two organizations, they must both be named as parties, according to the STO.\n[6] I disagree. It is the STO's service that is the subject of the complaint in this case, not the bus services, in general, that were provided during Winterlude. Mr. Brown has alleged that unlike able-bodied Ontario residents who wanted to attend events in Quebec, he was unable to board an STO bus. He does not take issue with the bus services provided by OC Transpo during Winterlude. Therefore, the fact that bus services during Winterlude 2005 were jointly offered by OC Transpo and the STO does not necessitate the addition of OC Transpo as a respondent.\n[7] The Respondent also argues that OC Transpo should be added as a party because it is OC Transpo's responsibility to provide bus services to Ontarians with disabilities. This allegation suggests a possible defense to the complaint and the need perhaps, to call a witness from OC Transpo to testify. However, it does not raise a question of liability on the part of OC Transpo since there is no suggestion that OC Transpo denied Mr. Brown transportation services on the basis of his disability.\n[8] With respect to remedy, Mr. Brown is seeking the accommodation necessary to use STO's bus services to travel to locations in Quebec as able-bodied travelers may do. In the event that the complaint is substantiated, OC Transpo's presence as a party is not necessary to provide such a remedy.\n[9] For these reasons, the STO's request to add OC Transpo as a respondent is denied.\nThe Addition of the A.G.Q. as a Respondent\n[10] The STO requests that the Attorney General of Quebec be added as a respondent because Mr. Brown's complaint may bring the constitutionality of the Act Respecting Public Transit Authorities (the Act) and the Policy on admissibility for adapted transportation (the Policy) into question. According to the STO, the Act and the Policy require that adapted transit users be residents of Quebec. Mr. Brown's demand that he should be accommodated regardless of his residency constitutes a challenge to the requirements of the Act and the Policy. Therefore, the STO argues that the A.G.Q. must be added as a respondent to defend the constitutionality of the Act and the Policy.\n[11] This argument must also be rejected. Neither Mr. Brown nor the Commission has directly or indirectly challenged the constitutionality of the Act or the Policy. The issue in the complaint is whether the failure to provide wheelchair accessible transportation to Mr. Brown was discriminatory or not. The STO may choose to raise the residency requirements in its defense, but the constitutionality of the Act and the Policy have not been put in issue.\n[12] Moreover, even if a constitutional question had been raised, the parties would be required only to provide notice to the A.G.Q. so that he might present evidence and make submissions if so desired (s. 57 of the Federal Courts Act). In this case, the A.G.Q. does not view a constitutional question as having been raised, and declines to participate in this matter. It is neither necessary nor appropriate to add the A.G.Q. as a party over his objections.\n[13] Therefore, the STO's request to add the A.G.Q. as a respondent is also denied.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] Elizabeth Millar, a consultant on behalf of the Canadian Association of Correctional Supervisors\/John Wiseman, asks the Tribunal to postpone indefinitely the hearing of Mr. Wiseman's human rights complaint dated September 30, 2003. The reason for this request is that the complainant does not have the financial resources to fund the Tribunal process.\n[2] Ms. Millar has previously made the same request that the Tribunal hearing be postponed indefinitely. The parties filed written submissions. The Tribunal denied the request on June 25, 2007. The Tribunal did allow the complainant more time to November 16, 2007, to decide whether he wished to proceed. The complainant confirmed at that time that he did.\n[3] The complainant wants the hearing of his complaint deferred until the resolution of a human rights complaint filed by the CR group in 1984, and a complaint by the PA group in 2006. Neither of these two complaints have been investigated by the Commission. As to the PA complaint, Ms. Millar indicates that a Federal Court hearing is expected in 2009. There is no timetable as to when the CR and PA complaints will be resolved or, if not, if and when the complaints will be referred to the Tribunal.\n[4] Further, it is not clear as to how the resolution of these complaints will result in a resolution of Mr. Wiseman's complaint. At best is the June 20, 2007 letter of Mr. Hunt, then counsel for Mr. Wiseman, in which he says . . . a settlement made on behalf of the tens of thousands would likely be a harbinger of eventual resolution of the ATL complaint. Similarly, a decision of the Tribunal, whether in favour of PSAC or the respondent would more likely then not, point the way to the eventual disposition of the ATL complaint. [emphasis added]\n[5] Section 48.9 (1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act provides that proceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and rules of procedure allow. The Commission has requested the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint and the Tribunal has an obligation to proceed with an inquiry as expeditiously as possible.\n[6] Indeed, the danger of delay was commented upon by the Federal Court in Canada Post Corporation v. Public Service Alliance of Canada and Canadian Human Rights Commission, 2008 FC 223. In its decision, commenting on the length of the Tribunal process in that case, the Court said (at paras. 264-265):\nIn my view, the Tribunal breached its duty under section 53 of the CHRA, and breached the duty to provide the parties with a fair hearing. A fair hearing is not a continuing process. A fair hearing is one where a party knows the case against it and has an opportunity of addressing that case within a reasonable time. At that point, the Tribunal has a duty to adjudicate upon the case.\nA legal hearing without discipline and timelines both delays and denies justice. Justice delayed is justice denied. . . .\n[7] There are two parties to this case, the complainant and the respondent. The respondent also has a right to know the case against it and the right to meet that case within a reasonable time.\n[8] Although the Tribunal appreciates the dilemma of the complainant, it is not reasonable or fair to ask that the Tribunal adjourn its proceedings for an indefinite period and depending on circumstances which may not occur for many years, if they occur at all.\n[9] Accordingly, Ms. Millar's request on behalf of John Wiseman to adjourn this hearing indefinitely is denied.\nSigned by J.

SECTION 67 OF THE CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT\n[1] The Complainant, Perry Dennis, alleges that the Respondent, the Eskasoni Band Council, did not hire him to work as a deckhand on a fishing boat because he failed to pass a pre-employment drug screening test. He claims that the Respondent's decision discriminated against him on the basis of his disability (drug dependency), under s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and that the Respondent's drug screening policy is itself discriminatory, within the meaning of s. 10 of the Act.\nI. THE PARTIES' PARTICIPATION AT THE HEARING INTO THE COMPLAINT [2] The Commission had initially referred five other complaints, along with Mr. Dennis', to the Tribunal. Shortly before the hearing began, four of those complainants settled their complaints with the Respondent. The Commission then advised the Tribunal that it would no longer participate at the hearing. Two days into the hearing, the other remaining co-complainant also settled his case.\n[3] Mr. Dennis was not represented by legal counsel at the hearing into his complaint. On the sixth day of the hearing, after Mr. Dennis had closed his case, he suddenly and without any notice to the Tribunal or the registry officer, collected his things and left the hearing room during a break in the proceedings, at around 11:45 AM, accompanied by his common law spouse, Mary Lou Gould. He never returned. I adjourned the proceedings for about two hours while the registry officer attempted to telephone Mr. Dennis at home. There was no response. I asked all persons present, including the Mi'kmaq interpreter assigned to this case, whether Mr. Dennis had mentioned why he had left and for how long. No one was able to provide any further details. Mr. Dennis was only observed picking up his papers and leaving without saying anything. The Respondent, at that time, was part way through its examination in chief of an expert witness. Given the circumstances, and particularly Mr. Dennis' sudden departure without any notice, excuse, or explanation, I decided to proceed in his absence. The Tribunal's digital voice recording system continued to record the proceedings and a copy of the audio recording was subsequently provided to both parties.\n[4] Later that afternoon, the registry officer sent an e-mail message to Mr. Dennis informing him that the hearing would continue as scheduled the following day. He was invited to contact the registry officer by e-mail or telephone. Mr. Dennis replied by e-mail to the registry officer that evening. He explained how he felt alone and overwhelmed by the proceedings, placing some blame on the Commission for failing to participate at the hearing and abandoning him to the wolves. The following morning, Mr. Dennis sent an e-mail to the registry officer asking whether Ms. Gould could appear on his behalf. She had been in attendance at the hearing since its outset and had already testified. I granted Mr. Dennis' request and she presented herself that afternoon. She is not a lawyer. She cross-examined the remaining witnesses who were called to testify by the Respondent and she made final submissions on Mr. Dennis' behalf.\n[5] The Respondent, for its part, was represented by legal counsel throughout the course of the hearing.\nII. THE FACTS GIVING RISE TO THIS COMPLAINT A. Mr. Dennis' car accident [6] Mr. Dennis is a registered member of the Mi'kmaq First Nation community of Eskasoni situated about 40 km south of Sydney, Nova Scotia. The Respondent is the community's band council (the Band).\n[7] Mr. Dennis grew up in Eskasoni and has spent most of his life there. He is 38 years old. In 1989, he was involved in a serious car accident. His injuries included fractures to his neck. He testified that the fractures have left him with several painful chronic health problems. From time to time, his neck will swell up, which restricts head rotation and causes him neck and shoulder pain as well as sharp headaches. His physicians initially prescribed him some strong medication to deal with the pain but it had the effect of making his face look droopy and sad, even though he felt fine. When he took weaker dosages, be claims to have become addicted to the pills, although he did not provide any further elaboration or explanation in his evidence.\n[8] Around 1990, Mr. Dennis discovered that using marijuana would relax him and ease his pain in his shoulders and neck, without the above-mentioned side effects that his physician-prescribed medication had caused him. He did not use marijuana on a daily basis, but only on the occasions when his pain would flare up. On some pain-ridden days, however, he would not take any marijuana and simply lived with his condition and the pain.\n[9] At one point in 2004, Mr. Dennis recalls asking a physician at Eskasoni's health clinic to prescribe marijuana medicinally for him. Mr. Dennis claims that although the physician did not disapprove of his marijuana usage, he told Mr. Dennis that he was not authorized to give such prescriptions. Mr. Dennis did not apparently try to find another physician who possessed such authorization. Instead, Mr. Dennis continued to acquire his marijuana through other unspecified means. The physician was not called as a witness in this case.\nB. The Eskasoni Fishery [10] Prior to 2000, the Band's fishery operation was quite modest. It was run by a department of the Band known as the Eskasoni Fish & Wildlife Commission (EFWC). Most of its activity was in fisheries research and conservation. There were only about five full-time employees and between 15 and 40 casual workers throughout the year.\n[11] In two 1999 decisions (R. v. Marshall, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 456 and R. v. Marshall, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 533), the Supreme Court affirmed the treaty rights of Mi'kmaq persons to hunt and fish, and to trade in the product of these activities, in order to earn a moderate livelihood for themselves and their families. Following these decisions, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) entered into agreements with First Nations to provide them with the tools that would enable them to develop their commercial fisheries. The Band signed such an agreement in 2000 (the Marshall Agreement), pursuant to which the DFO provided funding for the purchase of fishing licences, vessels and other equipment, the construction of buildings, and the training of fisheries workers.\n[12] When the Marshall Agreement was implemented in 2000, there were very few Band members who had the skills required to fish commercially. Consequently, the Band put in place programs to train individuals as certified deckhands, first mates, and captains. Mr. Dennis had done some work from time to time as a deckhand for non-native fishers between 1992 and 2000, but he had never gained his certification. Mr. Dennis therefore registered for the Band-offered training and he successfully obtained his deckhand certificate in 2000.\n[13] A deckhand's duties include cleaning, maintaining, mending and emptying nets. Deckhands also place catches such as shrimp into special bags, empty and bait traps, and clean the deck and bilge. A deckhand takes directions from the captain who, aside from guiding the boat, also operates the hauler or winch that is used to lift traps and nets into the boat.\n[14] The fishing season for most of the species fished by the Band runs typically from March to November. In order to distribute jobs equally amongst the qualified deckhands in Eskasoni, the EFWC compiled a list annually on which band members would place their names and phone numbers. As a boat would get prepared to go out to sea, the EFWC would call up deckhands off the list on a rotational basis. The fishers were compensated based on the size of the catch and the price at which it was sold. This form of employment was considered seasonal work that entitled a fisher to obtain employment insurance benefits in the off-season, provided his or her earnings exceeded a basic threshold (about $11,000). Mr. Dennis placed his name on the list and was called to work in 2001, 2002, and 2003. His 2003 earnings were just under $30,000. Thus, Mr. Dennis and the other EFWC deckhands were neither full-time nor indeterminate employees of EFWC. Their employment was casual. In 2005, the EFWC handed off management of the commercial fishery to a corporation called Crane Cove Seafoods, which was wholly owned by the Band. For all intents and purposes, the Band remained in charge of its commercial fishery.\n[15] According to the testimonies of the current Chief and several band councillors, reports began surfacing during the commercial fishery's first two years of operation in 2001-02, about fishers going out to sea while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Therefore, on December 10, 2002, a motion was passed by the Band Council that commercial fishers submit to mandatory drug testing. In the ensuing months, the Band appointed Jim Maloney to take charge of the development of a drug testing policy. Mr. Maloney was a member of another First Nation community in Nova Scotia. In the past, the Band had assigned him the task of developing other programs. By the summer of 2003, the proposed policy, entitled the Eskasoni Fit to Work (Drug and Alcohol) Program Policy, had been prepared.\n[16] Mr. Maloney testified that he conducted a number of information sessions for Eskasoni's commercial fishers in order to introduce them to the new policy. Posters were put up advertising the events and a one-page letter summarizing the policy was sent to the address of anyone involved in the EFWC fishery. The same letter was distributed to anyone who attended the information session. The letter was entitled Open Letter to the Community of Eskasoni - Fit to Work (Drug and Alcohol) Program. It stated that the people of Eskasoni had identified drug and alcohol abuse as a serious problem that was affecting everyone's life within the community and that the Band's Chief and Council were committed to resolving the problem. The letter went on to state that the policy was required in the Eskasoni commercial fishing operations, since commercial fishing is recognized as one of the most dangerous professions, making safety in the workplace essential in protecting the lives of those involved.\n[17] The letter also noted that the policy provides a series of progressive steps, linked to treatment, for those who test positive, so that they may ultimately return to work.\nC. The Fit to Work Policy [18] On September 16, 2003, the proposed policy was formally adopted by the Band Council. Its implementation was to begin during the 2004 fishing season. The policy states that its general purpose is to ensure that EFWC employees comply with and set an example in the community, by being drug and alcohol free in a safe, alcohol and drug-free workplace. The policy also extends to contractors and contract workers. Some of the specific objectives mentioned include:\npreventing employees from being in a position where impaired performance becomes a risk to them and the safe operation of EFWC facilities and equipment,\npreventing accidents and injuries resulting from the use of drugs and alcohol, and\nencouraging and supporting those with drug, alcohol and substance addictions in achieving and maintaining a drug and alcohol free quality of life.\n[19] The policy puts an onus on EFWC management and staff to read, understand and acknowledge the policy. Employees must meet a fitness to work standard, which is defined as being fit and capable of performing their work. This includes being free from the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, medications or substances that will affect performance. Employees are expected to seek advice and follow appropriate treatment if they suspect they have or are developing a substance dependency.\n[20] The policy provides that all EFWC employees are subject to drug and alcohol testing as a requirement of employment. Any job offer is conditional on passing the required test. Furthermore, random testing is to take place at the discretion of the employer throughout the year, without any advance notice. Testing may also take place after the occurrence of a significant incident that causes or has the potential to cause death, injury, or loss\/destruction of equipment. In addition, if managers have reasonable cause to believe that an employee's actions, appearance or conduct while on duty are indicative of drug or alcohol use, they may require that the employee be tested, but the decision must be made with the concurrence of a second person wherever possible.\n[21] The substances for which testing is conducted are the following:\nunder the category of drugs - cannabinoids (marijuana, hashish, hash oil), stimulants (cocaine, opiates, amphetamines) and veterinarian anaesthetics (phencyclidine (PCP)); and,\nunder the category of alcohol - beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol or other low molecular weight alcohols, including methyl or isopropyl alcohol.\nThe policy details how the screening test is carried out to see if any drugs and alcohol are present in amounts exceeding certain concentration levels (which are listed in a table). A positive result (i.e., in excess of these cut-off levels) is submitted to a more advanced test for further confirmation. Positive confirmation tests are then reported to a medical review officer for further evaluation and to ensure that an individual is not assigned a false positive laboratory result.\n[22] Where the medical review officer's evaluation confirms the initial result and rules out the possibility of a false positive, a series of assessment and treatment options are made available under the policy. If it is the first time that the individual has tested positive, it will be recommended that the person seek drug and alcohol assessment and\/or treatment, but this is strictly voluntary. The phone numbers for the Native Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselling Association (NADACA) and the Mi'kmaq lodge, where addiction counselling is available, are listed in the policy. An individual who wants to try to be hired again or to return to work must complete a return to work drug screening test that produces a negative result before being considered for the job.\n[23] If the individual tests positive a second time, then he or she will be required to see an addiction counsellor at NADACA for assessment but follow-up treatment will be voluntary, not mandatory. The individual remains ineligible to work. After a third failure, assessment and treatment become mandatory. The individual must complete the treatment before being re-hired, and the re-hiring is subject to the findings and recommendations provided by the addiction counsellor or treatment facility.\n[24] After a fourth failure, the person will be dismissed and not eligible for re-hire until proof of sobriety for a period of one year. Thomas Johnston, the EFWC's executive director, testified that the EFWC interpreted this period not to mean exactly twelve months but rather just until the next fishing season. Thus, even if some fishers did not pass the fourth test in October, they could nonetheless enter the testing process all over again the following spring, along with all the other fishers.\n[25] The policy stipulates that the EFWC will cover the cost of an initial substance abuse assessment of an individual who tests positive, but the cost of any other assessments or treatments is not covered by the EFWC. All testing results are confidential and are not to be disclosed except to the appropriate EFWC manager. Communication and correspondence of positive test results utilize a code rather than the individual's name and EFWC management is to maintain the list that matches the names with the codes in a secure location.\n[26] An individual who commits a policy violation during an on-call period or while working on EFWC premises, vessels or equipment is, at EFWC's discretion, subject to immediate dismissal, suspension from work without pay, removal from EFWC vessels or premises, police notification where there is the presence of illegal drugs, or placement on return to work status. In this latter instance, the individual will be considered for a return to work after being re-tested, as discussed above.\nD. The 2004 Testing [27] Mr. Maloney testified that for the 2004 fishing season, the Band hired on outside firm, East Coast Mobile Medical Inc. (East Coast), to conduct the drug testing on site in Eskasoni over the course of one day. He added that he sent notices to all fishers advising them that they had to register under the Fit to Work Program by March 8, 2004, on a list set up at the EFWC's offices. These notices were also broadcast on the local community television station.\n[28] Mr. Dennis claimed in his testimony that he never got this notice and that he only learned of the drug testing process mere days before it was conducted on May 14, 2004. The evidence calls into question this claim. He testified that he was out to sea in January and February, when the notices were distributed, although the evidence was that crews would usually leave port for no more than three days at a time. In addition, Mr. Dennis' denial of knowledge was contradicted by the drug testing registration sheet that was filed in evidence. His name appears on the list along with his telephone number, his Band number, and an annotation stating after 5 pm. Mr. Maloney testified that he recalled Mr. Dennis phoning him to register and indicating that he would prefer doing the testing after 5 pm. Mr. Maloney added that he did not object to this request since the EFWC was trying to be as flexible as possible in order to ensure that each fisher would be tested.\n[29] Furthermore, there is evidence that in March 2004, after the EFWC began registering persons for the testing, several fishers joined forces to form a union to oppose the imposition of the Fit to Work policy. Mr. Dennis helped organize the union and his name appears as a supporter in an open letter that was prepared prior to March 15, 2004. The letter invites all Eskasoni residents to attend a union meeting dealing with the Fit to Work policy. The meeting was held on March 22, 2004, and the minutes show that Mr. Dennis attended. It does not seem credible, therefore, for Mr. Dennis to claim that he did not know until mere days before, that the testing was forthcoming.\n[30] Mr. Dennis disapproved of the policy. He felt that it was an attack by the Chief and the Band Council against certain Band members, to prevent them from earning a good income. After being tested on May 14, 2004 (urinalysis and breathalyser), he contacted Mr. Johnston, who at the time was director of operations at EFWC, and learned that he had failed the urinalysis by testing positive for the presence of cannabis. Mr. Dennis testified in chief that he was not told he could be re-tested that season. He claims that Mr. Johnston told him that he would be denied work that summer and that he could only re-test the following year at his own cost.\n[31] Mr. Dennis' evidence on these points is contradicted by the evidence of Mr. Maloney and East Coast's business records. Mr. Maloney recalls having spoken to Mr. Dennis on the phone after he had failed the pre-employment drug testing. He remembers Mr. Dennis stating that he was eager to be re-tested and, hopefully be allowed to return to work that summer.\n[32] So Mr. Maloney undertook to book a new appointment for testing, which would have to take place at East Coast's facility in North Sydney, Nova Scotia. Mr. Maloney testified that he advised Mr. Dennis by telephone that an appointment was set for June 18, 2004. Mr. Dennis never showed up for this appointment. Mr. Maloney therefore booked a second appointment for Mr. Dennis, for August 6, 2004. Mr. Maloney recalls telling Mr. Dennis that it was important he attend because East Coast had billed the Band for the first appointment even though Mr. Dennis had not shown up. The East Coast records show that Mr. Dennis had been booked for both of these appointments, but that he had not shown up on either date.\n[33] I find this evidence persuasive and I am not convinced by Mr. Dennis' claim that he was told to come back next year to be re-tested. I note that such a response does not accord with the policy, which states that a person is entitled to be re-tested as many as four times. If the individual fails the fourth test, he or she may still take the test again one year later. This is the only time limitation mentioned. There are no time conditions attached with respect to the first re-testing. Presumably, whenever an individual feels ready to retake the test, he may do so. The entire testing and re-testing process set out in the policy is intended to be completed by the end of the annual fishing season, in keeping with the re-hiring process that takes place at the start of each fishing season. Thus, every fisher must pass a test every year, even if he or she tested negative the previous season. Furthermore, the policy provides that even in the worst case, where an individual fails the test four times, he or she remains ineligible for re-hire only until the following year.\n[34] Mr. Dennis emphasized in his testimony that East Coast only came to Eskasoni once a year to test all the fishers. This may have been the source of his misunderstanding regarding when he could take a re-test. There was some suggestion in the evidence that he may have been unwilling to go elsewhere to take the test. It was not unreasonable, however, for the Band to have required an individual who is seeking employment but failed the initial on-site test, to attend East Coast's offices in North Sydney (about an hour's drive from Eskasoni) to be re-tested, rather than paying for East Coast to bring its equipment down to Eskasoni again just to test one individual.\n[35] Although Mr. Dennis did not go to East Coast's facility in North Sydney to be tested, he did visit the Eskasoni Community Health Centre on June 23, 2004, where he was examined by an attending physician. The physician handwrote Mr. Dennis a five line note addressed to whom it may concern in which he stated that, based on his examination, Mr. Dennis appears to be fit to work. No further comment is provided and in particular, there is no mention made of any testing by the physician for drugs or alcohol.\n[36] Since Mr. Dennis did not end up taking another drug screening test in 2004, he was not cleared to work as a fisher for the EFWC that year.\n[37] After learning that he had failed the drug screening test, Mr. Dennis filed a Letter of Grievance with the Band, complaining of unfair testing by the EFWC. He alluded in the letter to a protest that the fishers involved in the union had conducted outside the EFWC offices for several days in May 2004. Allegedly, the Chief had met with them and agreed to allow fishers to work even if they tested positive. However, several days after the alleged agreement, the Band Council met and reaffirmed that the policy would be enforced. Mr. Dennis refers in his grievance to the Canadian Human Rights Commission policy on alcohol and drug testing which he had apparently consulted. He asserted that the Commission's policy clearly states that his rights were being infringed.\n[38] Interestingly, Mr. Dennis makes no mention in his letter of any requirement for him to use marijuana as a pain medication for his neck and shoulder. He refers to having experienced headaches, fatigue, depression, insomnia, and loss of appetite, but he attributes these problems to the many stressors brought upon him by the application of the policy that resulted in his inability to work. Mr. Dennis attached the above-mentioned physician's note to his grievance letter.\n[39] On July 7, 2004, Mr. Dennis filed the present human rights complaint, in which he stated that he was denied employment because of the fact that I have a physical disability and I take the drug marijuana. In his Statement of Particulars, however, which he later filed jointly with the Commission, he made no mention of a physical disability, but instead alleged that the Band discriminated against him on the basis of disability or perceived disability, which he specified as being drug dependency. He did not allege discrimination based on any disability relating to his back and neck injury. He led his case in keeping with the allegations set out in the Statement of Particulars. The Band, in turn, took the position that the disability in issue is drug dependency and presented its case accordingly. Although the actual complaint is somewhat ambiguous in its description of the alleged discrimination, it would in my view be unfair to the Band to treat this matter as anything other than a claim of discrimination based on drug dependency, given the way that the case has unfolded.\nE. The 2005-2006 Testing [40] Drug screening was conducted for all fishers again, in 2005, and Mr. Dennis was tested on April 22, 2005. He tested positive for cannabinoids. In cross-examination, Mr. Dennis was asked if he sought re-testing in 2005. He could not recall but said that he must have been doing something. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that he sought re-testing in 2005.\n[41] As the 2006 fishing season was approaching, Mr. Dennis decided to take measures to ensure he could pass the drug screening. He stopped using marijuana altogether. However, the anguish he was feeling of not being able to earn a good living and look after the well-being of his family had led to his becoming very depressed. One evening, he began drinking alcohol even though he had been sober for seven years. His drinking became excessive, to the point that the RCMP had to intervene and take him to the detachment where he spent the night.\n[42] Fortunately for Mr. Dennis, a community Elder learned of his troubles and stepped in to help Mr. Dennis by taking him to a sweat lodge. Traditional healing methods were administered to him for his pain, including the application of bear grease. Mr. Dennis testified that he became better able to cope with his pain as a result of these healing methods.\n[43] On March 24, 2006, Mr. Dennis was tested again for the presence of drugs. This time the tests came back negative. His name was thus added to the list of available fishers and he worked that season.\n[44] In 2007, Mr. Dennis did not register to take the EFWC's drug testing. Mr. Dennis apparently formed the mistaken opinion that he did not need to formally register for testing in 2007 because he had passed the previous year. He thought he was entitled to merely show up on the day of the testing and provide his sample. This understanding was inaccurate. Mr. Dennis (and all fishers) had to formally register each year for testing. Since Mr. Dennis had not registered he was not entitled to submit himself for testing in 2007.\n[45] Regarding the 2008 season, the hearing was completed as the fishing season was about to start. The EFWC's fishing manager testified that Mr. Dennis had not shown up for his scheduled drug testing appointment on March 28, 2008. The evidence before me with respect to this event and the 2008 season overall is, however, insufficient for me to make any findings.\nIII. THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO THIS CASE [46] Mr. Dennis' complaint is brought pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 7 makes it a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ, or to continue to employ, an individual, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 10 makes it a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or pursue a policy or practice that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[47] Section 3 of the Act designates disability as a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 25 of the Act specifies that the term disability includes previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug.\n[48] The initial onus is on a complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination (Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28 (O'Malley)). A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made, and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\n[49] Once the prima facie case is established, it is incumbent upon the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for the otherwise discriminatory practice (Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204 at para. 18). An employer's conduct will not be considered discriminatory if it can establish that its refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) (s. 15(1)(a) of the Act). For any practice to be considered a BFOR, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of the individual or class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost (s. 15(2) of the Act).\nIV. THE SECTION 7 COMPLAINT A. Has a prima facie case been established under s. 7? (i) Was Mr. Dennis disabled (i.e. drug dependent) within the meaning of the Act? [50] I find that Mr. Dennis did not demonstrate that he was disabled within the meaning of the Act. The evidence unquestionably establishes that he was a user of marijuana but it was not sufficient to establish prima facie that he was drug dependent.\n[51] Mr. Dennis testified that he suffers from chronic pain as a result of the traffic accident in which he was involved in 1988. Several documents dating from 1988-89 were filed detailing some of the treatments that he received following the accident. His common-law spouse attested in her evidence to the outward signs of pain that Mr. Dennis presents to this day. There is no basis, in my view, to question Mr. Dennis' claims about the physical pain that he experiences.\n[52] More importantly, however, no evidence was put before me that he was dependent on marijuana when he failed the drug test in 2004 and filed this complaint. To establish a prima facie case, the evidence led must be sufficient to cover the allegations made. Mr. Dennis' allegation is that he is dependent on the drug and is therefore disabled. But I find that his evidence only demonstrates that he used the drug, not that he was dependent on it. The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary's definition for the word dependent, in the context relevant to s. 25 of the Act, is the following:\nResting entirely on someone or something for maintenance, support, or other requirement; obliged to use something; unable to do without someone or something, especially a drug; maintained at another's cost.\n(emphasis added)\nThe French rendering of s. 25 utilizes the term la d\u00e9pendance ... envers l'alcool ou la drogue. Le Petit Robert de la langue fran\u00e7aise, 2006 defines d\u00e9pendance, in this context, as:\n\u00c9tat r\u00e9sultant de la consommation r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e d'une substance toxique, qui se caract\u00e9rise par le besoin de continuer la prise et d'augmenter les doses.\nTranslated to English :\nState resulting from the repeated use of a toxic substance, characterized by the need to continue its use and increase the amount taken.\n[53] Both these definitions, in my view, capture the meaning of the term as it is used in s. 25. Applying these definitions to the present case, I find that there is insufficient evidence to establish prima facie that Mr. Dennis was dependent on marijuana (i.e., unable to do without it, or alternately, in a state where he needed to continue its use and increase the amount taken).\n[54] He did not call any physician (including the Eskasoni Community Health Centre physician whom he visited on June 23, 2004) to testify that he was dependent on marijuana, nor did he file any expert report to the same effect. No other witness was called to confirm the extent of his marijuana usage, even though Mr. Dennis initially stated in his testimony in chief that everyone in the community knew of his condition and of his habit. In cross-examination, however, he testified that the majority of the people in the community did not know he smoked marijuana. Mr. Dennis claimed that even his children had not known that he was using marijuana. He complained about the fact that in not hiring him, the Band had effectively made it known publicly that he had failed the drug and alcohol pre-screening test, which he viewed as a violation of his right to privacy. On balance, it appears to me that his marijuana use was, in fact, not very evident.\n[55] Mr. Dennis testified that he was using marijuana as a pain medicine, which he would take in varying amounts that he would try to stretch out as much as possible. The fact that the policy was forcing him to change his way of life and begin using other means to cope with his neck and shoulder pain bothered him. He preferred to use marijuana over other pain medications that his physicians had prescribed to him in the past. He stated in his evidence that he wondered why the Band was requesting him to give up his marijuana use. I note again, however, that he made no mention of any drug dependence in the grievance letter that he sent to the Band prior to filing the present complaint.\n[56] Mr. Dennis confirmed that by applying traditional healing methods, he was able to accept and cope with the pain relating to the injuries he had suffered in the 1988 car accident. He therefore ceased using marijuana to deal with the pain and thus passed the EFWC's pre-employment drug screening in 2006. He testified that he did not experience any withdrawal symptoms after stopping his marijuana use. There was no indication in his testimony or elsewhere in the evidence that the traditional healing methods he received at the sweat lodge were in any way used to address a drug or alcohol dependency. This was not a drug or alcohol rehabilitation treatment that he received.\n[57] In determining whether Mr. Dennis was disabled due to a drug dependency, I am mindful that the notion of disability is not to be interpreted narrowly. Disability may exist even without proof of physical limitations or the presence of an ailment (Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. City of Montreal, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665 at para. 76). Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case, the evidence regarding Mr. Dennis' drug usage does not support his claim that he was dependent on a drug. (The matter of whether the Band perceived him as disabled is addressed in the next section of this decision).\n[58] His assertion that he used marijuana regularly has not been contradicted, and the results of the pre-employment drug testing of 2004 and 2005 would not be at odds with such a finding. However, regular use of marijuana does not necessarily constitute frequent use. As I elaborate later in this decision, expert evidence was led to show that even a single use of marijuana will be detected by a drug test even ten days later. More frequent use can be detected even one to two months later.\n[59] I am not persuaded that the mere presence of the drug in his system, nor for that matter the other evidence regarding his marijuana usage, establishes prima facie that he was dependent on the drug within the meaning of the Act (i.e. that he could not do without it or that he had a continuing need to use it, in increasing amounts).\n(ii) Did the Band perceive Mr. Dennis as being drug dependent? [60] As the jurisprudence in similar cases instructs us, however, the fact that a tribunal is not persuaded that a complainant is drug dependent and therefore suffers from a disability, is not fatal to that person's human rights complaint (see Milazzo v. Autocar Connaisseur Inc., 2003 CHRT 37 at paras. 82-88, Alberta (H.R.C.C.) v. Kellogg Brown and Root (Canada) Company, 2007 ABCA 426 at paras. 29-30, leave to appeal to SCC denied May 29, 2008 (docket no. 32505)). The prohibition against discriminating on the basis of a disability has been extended to cases where an employer refuses to employ an individual based upon a perception that the individual is dependent on alcohol or drugs.\n[61] There is no evidence before me to suggest that the Band actually perceived Mr. Dennis to be drug dependent. Mr. Dennis certainly did not call any witnesses or produce any document affirming the existence of such an opinion. Nothing before me indicates that any questions were asked or any investigation was carried out by the Band in order to determine whether Mr. Dennis was drug dependent (see Milazzo at para. 90). In fact, Mr. Maloney testified that the Band never assumed that an individual who tested positive on the first test (like Mr. Dennis) was addicted, as demonstrated by the fact that drug or alcohol dependency assessments or treatments were not required of Mr. Dennis and others like him before they could take the test for a second time.\n[62] None of the Band's employees who gave evidence at the hearings testified knowing that Mr. Dennis was using marijuana. Mr. Dennis asserted in his own testimony that he never went to work in previous years while under the influence of marijuana. Thus, presumably, no outward signals were available to the EFWC and the Band of his marijuana usage, let alone any indication that would result in their perceiving him as being drug dependent.\n[63] As the Milazzo Tribunal held, at para. 92, in order to benefit from the protections afforded by the Act, a complainant must demonstrate the involvement of one or more of the prescribed grounds listed in s. 3 of the Act. Having failed to establish even on a prima facie basis that he was either disabled due to drug dependency or was perceived by the Band to be so disabled, Mr. Dennis has not established a prima facie case of discrimination, and accordingly, his s. 7 complaint is dismissed.\nV. THE SECTION 10 COMPLAINT [64] In contrast to complaints under s. 7, which relate to employer actions affecting specific, named individuals, s. 10 addresses the discriminatory effect that employer policies or practices may have or may tend to have on an individual or class of individuals (Milazzo, at para. 94). The focus is therefore not confined to Mr. Dennis' own situation.\nA. Has a prima facie case been established under s. 10? [65] Extensive evidence was led about the widespread problem of drug and alcohol use at Eskasoni. I note that one of the Band's declared objectives for adopting the policy was to encourage and support those with substance addictions in achieving and maintaining a drug and alcohol free quality of life. The number of Eskasoni residents who sign up to be fishers has increased significantly over the years. As the proportion of the Eskasoni population that joins the ranks of the commercial fishers increases, it becomes more likely that persons struggling with substance abuse, and thus dependent on drugs or alcohol (i.e. disabled within the meaning of s. 25) will seek out this work, only to fail the drug and alcohol screening test. Those who fail will be - at least temporarily - deprived of the opportunity to work as fishers. Just as in Milazzo, in my view, the policy in the present case will therefore inevitably affect individuals who suffer from substance related disabilities.\n[66] A drug testing policy that has the effect of depriving these individuals, who fall within the protected class of disabled persons, of employment opportunities, is thus prima facie discriminatory under s. 10 of the Act. I note in passing that the Band's counsel acknowledged in his final submissions that a great deal of jurisprudence suggests that drug testing cases of this sort are prima facie discriminatory (see Milazzo at para. 97).\nB. Has the Band discharged its burden of providing a reasonable explanation? [67] As I mentioned earlier, once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation. In this particular case, the Band has sought to demonstrate that there was a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) for the adoption of the drug testing policy (s. 15(1)(a) of the Act). To do so, the Band must establish that accommodating these individuals, who are either drug dependent or perceived as such, would impose undue hardship on the Band, considering health, safety and cost (s. 15(2) of the Act).\n[68] The Supreme Court has articulated a three-step approach to be followed in determining whether a BFOR has been established (see British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin). A respondent may justify the impugned standard by proving, on the balance of probabilities, that:\nThe respondent adopted the standard for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the job or function being performed; The respondent adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate purpose or goal; The standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that purpose or goal. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, the respondent must demonstrate that it cannot accommodate the complainant or persons with the complainant's characteristics without experiencing undue hardship.\n(i) Did the Band adopt its policy for a purpose or goal rationally connected to the job or function being performed? [69] The focus of this first step in the analysis is not on the validity of the standard or policy but rather on the validity of its more general purpose (Meiorin, at para. 59). I am satisfied, on the evidence, that the purpose of the Band's adoption of the Fit to Work policy was to prevent employees from being injured as well as from causing damage to the Band's property, due to drug or alcohol related impairment. These objectives are in my view rationally connected to the performance of fishers' jobs (deckhands, first mates, captains) in a safe environment, as well as helping to assure the long term viability of their jobs.\n(ii) Did the Band adopt its standard in good faith? [70] At this step in the analysis, a respondent must establish that it adopted the standard or policy with an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the accomplishment of its purpose, with no intention of discriminating against the claimant (Meiorin, at para. 60). If the imposition of the standard was not thought to be reasonably necessary or was motivated by discriminatory animus, then it cannot be a BFOR.\n[71] As I indicated earlier, soon after Eskasoni's commercial fishery began operating in 2001, reports began surfacing of fishers being out at sea while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The current Chief of the Eskasoni Band is Charles Joseph Dennis. He was director of the commercial fishery at that time. He testified that he was receiving many complaints from people working on the Band's vessels who were worried about their personal safety because other fishers were impaired. Chief Dennis recalled one captain telling him that while out at sea one day, he thought all his crew had fallen overboard. Just as he was about to call the coast guard, he noticed puffs of smoke coming from inside the vessel's lifeboat. All three deckhands had crawled inside it to smoke drugs.\n[72] Thomas Johnston, who was EFWC Director of Operations until 2004, testified that on one occasion a captain was so drunk while fishing that he passed out. One of the deckhands had to steer the vessel back into port and in the process bumped it against the wharf. Mr. Johnston also heard reports that some fishers were trafficking in drugs on the Band's fishing boats as well. As I already mentioned, there is widespread usage and abuse of alcohol and drugs within the Eskasoni community.\n[73] The Band contends, therefore, that it adopted the Fit to Work policy in the honest and good faith belief that it would assist in preventing or reducing the incidence of alcohol and drug usage by its employees and thereby prevent them from being injured and causing damage to Band property. As a bonus, the Band hoped that the policy would help curb substance abuse within the community at large.\n[74] Mr. Dennis appeared to suggest in his evidence that the policy was adopted with another intention entirely: to adversely affect particular individuals or families within the Eskasoni community. The evidence does not support this claim, however. The minutes from a number of Band council meetings were produced at the hearing. They document the councillors' broad support for the policy's adoption. Their declared reasons for supporting it all relate to workplace safety and the encouragement of substance-free living within the community. No other motive is indicated. Mr. Dennis suggested that some of the councillors were coerced into adopting these positions of support for the policy but he did not present any foundation for this belief. His assertion was not corroborated by other witnesses or evidence. Mr. Maloney, in his testimony, stated that family issues arise in any small community and that family feuds and factions might have played a little bit of a role, but that the major issue for the Band was safety and maintaining the fishery's productivity and viability. He did not elaborate any further on how these feuds may have played themselves out. Mr. Johnston agreed that a dispute did arise between some families over the policy, but that only occurred after its adoption, as groups within the community began taking sides over its implementation. Of note, none of the alleged targets of the Fit to Work policy were called as witnesses to comment on whether they perceived the situation in the manner alleged by Mr. Dennis.\n[75] Perhaps most importantly, as the question relates to the second of the three steps in the Meiorin analysis, there has been no assertion made or evidence brought forward that the Band's animus, as expressed by the Supreme Court in Meiorin, was to discriminate against drug dependent (i.e. disabled) persons, which is the group that Mr. Dennis alleges in his complaint had been discriminated against.\n[76] I find the evidence regarding the Band's alleged ulterior motives for the adoption of the policy to be unpersuasive. They constitute nothing more than mere conjecture on Mr. Dennis' part. I am satisfied that the Band has established that the policy was adopted in the good faith belief that it was necessary for the fulfillment of the objectives stated in the first step of the Meiorin analysis.\n(iii) Is the standard reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the purpose or goal? [77] In order to satisfy this step in the analysis, the Band must demonstrate that it cannot accommodate drug and alcohol dependent persons (i.e. disabled persons) who test positive for the presence of drugs or alcohol in their systems, without experiencing undue hardship considering health, safety and cost (s. 15(2) of the Act). The Band alleges that undue hardship would be experienced in this case based both on the factors of safety and cost.\na) Safety as a consideration - a safe workplace [78] The Band contends that it is required to make every effort to prevent impaired employees from working on its vessels for the safety of those very employees. The Band must therefore test its workers for the presence of drug and alcohol. Any accommodation that would prevent the Band from keeping workers who fail their test off its vessels would impose undue hardship on the Band.\n[79] On the question of workplace safety, Mr. Dennis conceded in his Statement of Particulars, prepared jointly with the Commission, that the work of a captain of a commercial fishing vessel is safety sensitive. Mr. Dennis did not make any similar concession with respect to the other available jobs on the Band's fishing vessels. The Band, for its part, contends that safety is a major concern with respect to all of its employees who fish on its vessels (captains, first mates, and deckhands).\n[80] For the purpose of this analysis, I do not believe it is important to make distinctions between so-called safety sensitive work and non-safety sensitive work. What must really be determined is whether accommodating the class of individuals in questions (drug or alcohol dependent persons) would impose undue hardship to the Band considering safety, as the matter has been raised in the present case.\n[81] Greg Johnstone, the consultant who helped draft the Fit to Work policy, was called by the Band to testify as an expert in risk management in the workplace, occupational health and safety, as well as in toxicology. His expertise in these areas was established at the hearing. Mr. Johnstone stated that as part of any employer's duty to ensure the health and safety of all workplace parties, the guiding rule or principle is one of prevention. One of the key elements of a health and safety management system consists of identifying, evaluating and controlling hazards. The greater the exposure to hazards that could lead to accident or harm, the greater that safety becomes a matter of concern for the job, thereby justifying the need for effective recognition, evaluation, control and prevention of the harm associated with the hazard.\n[82] In the case of a commercial fishing operation such as the one run by the Band, the very nature of the activities and the environmental exposure to the elements create large hazards, risks, and probabilities of occurrence of harm, which according to Mr. Johnstone render the work highly safety-sensitive. In this context, I take him to mean that safety thus becomes a matter of increased concern due to the prevailing working conditions. Mr. Johnstone pointed out that safety becomes an issue even with respect to the most mundane of jobs on a vessel that is out on the water and away from shore because if an urgent situation arises (e.g. rough seas, fire on board, pulling in a person who has gone overboard, etc.), every worker would be expected to assist. Mr. Maloney testified that the vessels fish 100 to 200 km off-shore, where weather and ocean conditions change quickly. Some boats have had their windows blown out by the rough seas and crews have had occasion to simply cut their lines and rush back to port.\n[83] Mr. Johnstone referred to a number of studies regarding fishing vessel safety confirming the dangerous nature of commercial fishing. He also cited the Nova Scotia Workers' Compensation Board Rate Book, which lists the premiums payable by employers. They vary depending on the levels of compensation that the Board has had to pay to workers in the past. According to Mr. Johnstone, the actual risk of harm associated with particular types of jobs is thus reflected in the magnitude of the premiums. The premiums for jobs involved in the commercial fishery (on the water) are near the top of the scale for the province. In Mr. Johnstone's opinion, as soon as a worker sets foot on a vessel and leaves port, the very nature of the work becomes dangerous with numerous specific hazards and circumstances under which those hazards can lead to harmful outcomes including loss of life.\n[84] Mr. Dennis spoke about some of those hazards in his own evidence. His vessel broke down four times in one year and had to be towed back into port. He stated that while the Coast Guard Service will not let fishers go out on windy days, he has been at sea on occasion in rough waters. When he works on vessels harvesting snow crab, the equipment he uses includes a hauler comprised of a system of pulleys and hydraulics, which lifts traps out of the water. The captain controls the hauler while the deckhands grab the ropes, empty the traps, re-bait them and place them up over the edge of the boat to be dropped into the water. Shrimp boats operate with a winch that pulls up a net. Deckhands empty the net as it is hauled in and place the shrimp into bags. Mr. Dennis admitted that if the equipment involved in the commercial fishery is not properly maintained, the fishers could get hurt if, for instance, a cable is not in good shape or one of the pulleys comes loose.\n[85] Mr. Dennis was the only deckhand on the vessels on which he worked who wore a life vest (which he had purchased for himself). Deckhands are not required to wear life vests at sea, which exposes them to further risk of harm if they fall overboard and which would hamper, one would think, the rest of the crew's efforts to save them even more. Mr. Dennis also recalled an incident were a fellow deckhand dove under the water to untangle a rope that was caught in the boat's propeller. The individual was badly injured in the process.\n[86] In my view, the evidence is more than persuasive that workplace conditions put the safety of all employees working on the Band's fishing vessels very much at risk, including the job of deckhand.\nb) Impairment is a safety hazard [87] According to Mr. Johnstone, an individual whose functional capacity and fitness for dangerous work is impaired due to drugs or alcohol, is a major hazard to his or her safety and that of others within this type of workplace environment. Such a hazard must be approached with the same prudence and due diligence as one would exercise in the presence of, for instance, faulty or inadequate equipment, a lack of employee competency, or unsafe working conditions. In these circumstances, an employer must apply the same principles and measures of a sound safety management system to a person, who is in essence a hazard, as they must to non-human hazards. That is, the employer must proactively seek out, evaluate, monitor, and control the respective hazards in the interests of preventing the adverse outcomes that could reasonably be expected to occur if they were not controlled. Mr. Johnstone associates this approach with the concept in risk management known as the Precautionary Principle, which holds that protective action should be taken by stake holders when there is reasonable evidence that not to do so could lead to harm.\n[88] The Fit to Work policy adopted by the Band provided that testing would be conducted for the presence of alcohol and five types of drugs (known as a Panel V test):\nCannabis (marijuana, hashish, hash oil),\nAmphetamines (e.g. speed, crystal meth)\nOpioids or Opiates (e.g. morphine, oxycodone),\nCocaine (including Crack)\nPhencyclidine (PCP) (a veterinary general anaesthetic).\nMr. Johnstone referred to a Panel V test as being typical and constituting the industry standard. All of these drugs can impair a person's functions in the period immediately following consumption.\n[89] According to Mr. Johnstone, the mere presence of a drug known to be capable of impairing the worker should be the basis of employing the Precautionary Principle, by removing the subject employee from the workplace where safety is a serious concern, until adequate evaluation and management of any associated risk is achieved, particularly where the amount of the drug detected exceeds acceptable cut-off levels.\n[90] This evidence is persuasive. It is clear, in my view, that an impaired employee poses a major hazard to the safety of himself and others in workplaces such as the fishing vessels of the EFWC.\nc) Is the drug and alcohol screening process an effective means to detect the presence of a hazard in the workplace? [91] Mr. Dennis contends that drug and alcohol screening is ineffective as a means for detecting the presence in the workplace of a hazard related to the impairment of workers. He argued, for instance, that testing for cannabinoids does not measure present impairment but merely the presence of the drug in the individual's system from past usage. Mr. Johnstone explained in his testimony that cannabis is a drug that is absorbed by body fat. Although the blood level of the drug may drop, an amount continues to leak out from the body fat. A single usage of marijuana may be detected (i.e., will exceed the levels established in the Fit to Work policy) up to ten days later. Regular usage (weekly or daily) may be detected one or even two months later.\n[92] Is there, therefore, any value in testing for drugs such as cannabinoids where the usage may have occurred weeks earlier and where the testing is not conducted while the subject is at work? Mr. Johnstone testified that there are lingering and residual effects associated with drug use, including cannibinoids. These effects include sustained disturbances in body functions (sleep and hormone disturbances), nutrition deficiencies, health or toxicity damage to organ systems, preoccupations with relationship difficulties, and even the financial or legal problems associated with drug use. Even if a person has suspended or ended his substance use, one or more of these symptoms can contribute to relapse or return to use, perhaps while the person works on a vessel. In the case of alcohol, Mr. Johnstone referred to hangovers, which persist even though the alcohol may no longer be present in an individual's blood. The lingering effects such as headaches and tiredness will continue to impair the person's functionality and thereby put him or her at risk.\n[93] Mr. Johnstone testified that some drugs like PCP, cocaine, as well as marijuana when taken in high dosages, can result in the user experiencing flashbacks well after the drug was taken. These flashbacks result in sensory perceptions that cause the user to become preoccupied with fantasies, unpleasant memories or other distractions, resulting in impairment. Such flashbacks are particularly profound with drugs like PCP. Mr. Johnstone pointed out that nowadays, PCP has been known to be added to street drugs like marijuana to give it an increased effect, simulating a good quality product.\n[94] In the broader sense, with regard to the value of finding persons testing positive even though they are no longer impaired, Mr. Johnstone points out that the detection of a drug that is known to impair worker safety can and should be treated in much the same way as the smell of alcohol on a driver's breath alerts a police officer to the necessity of inquiring into the driver's blood alcohol level. As Mr. Johnstone notes, the big problem from a safety perspective is the high level of uncertainty associated with having a positive test while not knowing the extent of impairment, if any, present in the worker and how that may increase risk. In his opinion, drug testing is an effective and useful measure that provides some objective foundation from which to proceed with other measures that may ultimately effectively address problems. As the Tribunal in Milazzo similarly found, at para. 171, although a positive drug test does not indicate that a worker was actually impaired while on the job, it serves as a red flag that can assist in identifying workers who are at higher risk.\n[95] Are there any alternative means for assessing the risk? Could the Band rely on the fishers themselves to refuse to board a vessel if they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol? Mr. Dennis testified that he never worked while under the influence of marijuana. Such assurances, however, do not preclude the possibility of the fishers continuing to be subject to the lingering post-usage effects that Mr. Johnstone highlighted in his evidence. More importantly, Mr. Johnstone pointed out that drug users are not inclined to notify their supervisors of their drug use or impairment, and are in fact much more likely to deny their use and the drug's effects on them. Once drug users reach the advanced stages of abuse or addiction (stages which presumably would come within the meaning of drug dependency under s. 25 of the Act), many manifestations of that state contribute to denial and their inability to evaluate their own state of fitness.\n[96] Can supervisors themselves be relied upon to identify drug impairment amongst their employees? The Fit to Work policy anticipated this possibility. In the list setting out management responsibilities under the policy, managers were directed to confront employees about any observed impairment and to suggest such employees obtain - or refer them to - appropriate assessment and treatment. Managers could submit employees whom they reasonably suspected to be using drugs or alcohol, to testing. In the period leading up to the policy's implementation, the Band provided training on how to identify employee drug usage during the information sessions that were given exclusively to captains.\n[97] Mr. Johnstone testified that while subjective observations may be of some use, they are not an effective means to assess risk. To begin with, there may be insufficient interaction between the supervisor and the employee to enable him to observe any impairment. The Band's fishing vessels obviously do not constitute large workplaces but nevertheless, evidence was led of at least one captain who was apparently so preoccupied with his own job tasks that he failed to observe his entire crew sneak away into a lifeboat and consume drugs. Of greater concern is the state of the supervisors themselves. As I indicated earlier, there were incidents reported of captains being impaired by drugs or alcohol. On the water, there is no one to supervise them. Finally, even the most well-trained supervisor may be effectively fooled by an employee who is in fact using drugs. Mr. Johnstone testified that despite his many years of training and experience in the areas of toxicology and impairment, he can be manipulated by an experienced person with a history of drug use. Drug and alcohol testing, therefore, provides an objective scientific tool that cannot be fooled like individuals who would draw their conclusions based solely on subjective observations of a person's eyes or demeanour, for example.\n[98] Some may also question the effectiveness of testing given the possibility that individuals may refrain from using drugs or alcohol in advance of their test, pass the screening, but then use drugs or alcohol thereafter and possibly work while still under their effect. Mr. Johnstone addressed this concern by pointing out that pre-access testing is an opportunity to screen someone before placing that person and his co-workers in a hazardous situation. However, it is possible that a person will test negative and then use a substance thereafter and thus go to work impaired. Nevertheless, the process is worthwhile in at least helping to identify those who are so dependent that they have lost self-control and cannot regulate their consumption, if only long enough to pass the test.\n[99] I am satisfied, therefore, that the Band's drug and alcohol screening process is an effective means to detect the presence of safety hazards within the workplace and ultimately, of attaining the goal of preventing fishers from working while impaired.\nd) Cost as a factor - The impact on the Band's commercial fishery [100] Safety was not the only reason for the Band to be concerned about the hazards and risks created by the presence of impaired workers within the workplace. The Band relies heavily on the proceeds from the commercial fishery for the general well-being of the community and its members. The Band was worried about the financial losses it would suffer were the fishery's operations to be disrupted.\n[101] The Eskasoni Band's finances have been in a critical state for years. By 1995, its accumulated deficit had reached $14 million. The Department of Indian and Northern Affairs (INAC) intervened and imposed a system of co-management on the Band whereby an independent auditing firm was assigned to co-manage the Band's operations. Since 2001, Alan Simpson, a chartered accountant, has served as the Band's co-manager. He testified that a 15 year plan has been put in place to reduce the deficit by $875,000 annually. This objective has to be met while at the same time, the Band must continue to provide services to the community that include social assistance (about $10 million per year), education (another $10 million annually), and housing (about $1 million per year). The Band's total operating budget is about $50 million. According to Mr. Simpson, INAC and other government funding does not exceed $30 million. The Band therefore relies on other sources of funding to balance its budget and meet its deficit reduction objectives. These additional sources include gaming, tobacco sales, and the commercial fishery. The latter accounts for about $2 million in net annual contributions to the budget. Without the infusion of the commercial fishery revenues, the Band would be unable to meet its targets. It would otherwise be required to cut spending in sectors such as housing or social assistance. This reliance on commercial fishery revenues and other local sources of income is accentuated by the fact that the Band's population, according to Band manager Gerard Francis, is increasing at a much greater rate than the rate at which government funding has been rising.\n[102] The Band has faced some significant challenges in maintaining its revenues from the commercial fishery. Seafood prices have dropped significantly since 2001 when the EFWC's post-Marshall Agreement commercial fishery first began operating. There has only been a very modest rise in prices in the last year, solely with regard to a few of the species harvested. Furthermore, the increase in operating costs, namely fuel for the vessels, threatens to cut into profits, although this phenomenon was likely not as much a factor in 2004 when Mr. Dennis filed his complaint. The point is that the viability of the Band's commercial fishery is fragile; any number of factors may put it at risk. At the same time, the Band relies heavily on the revenues generated from it, not to mention the roughly one hundred fishers and their families who depend on the income they earn from the seasonal work and the employment insurance benefits to which they are then entitled in the off-season. Employment opportunities in Eskasoni are limited and unemployment rates are high. The availability of this gainful employment, in turn, eases the demand for social assistance from the Band.\n[103] The Band argues that allowing the use of alcohol and drugs on the vessels to go unheeded will put this source of income at risk. Mr. Maloney mentioned in his evidence that by 2003, problems were developing regarding the availability of crews. Call-outs for deckhands came at all hours of the day, including overnight, due to changing weather patterns and tides. Eskasoni's vessels were deployed from harbours that were quite a distance away from the community (e.g., Louisbourg, Arichat), which meant that crews needed a bit of time to reach the vessels. The window of opportunity was therefore small. According to Mr. Maloney, many crew members did not respond to these calls for duty and their failure to do so was often due to drug or alcohol use. They just were not in a condition to go to work. In 2003, a lot of product was left in the water, including 300,000 lbs. of shrimp worth about $600,000. Other bands had to be invited to collect the shrimp.\n[104] Gerard Francis, the Band's manager, testified of his fear that the DFO may revoke the Band's licences and seize its vessels if it caught crews using drugs and alcohol while at sea. Another concern, of which the Band was aware when the policy was adopted according to the testimony of several witnesses, was the potential for criminal liability under amendments to the Criminal Code enacted following the tragic loss of life at the Westray mine in Nova Scotia. Bill C-45 created an explicit duty amongst those who have responsibility for directing the work of others to take reasonable steps to prevent bodily harm or fatal injuries among workers, failing which the employer organization and its senior officers could be charged with an offence, which carries high maximum fines. The Band's legal counsel at the time had informed the Band Council of these new provisions.\n[105] In sum, therefore, taking all of the circumstances into account, the Band has, in my view, established that it would experience hardship considering both safety and cost, if it failed to implement a policy in an effort to prevent crew members from working on its vessels while impaired by drugs and alcohol. But a further question remains to be answered; is that hardship undue?\ne) Is the Band's hardship undue? [106] In determining the answer to the question, courts and tribunals must be sensitive to the various ways in which individual capabilities may be accommodated, as well as be innovative yet practical when considering how this may best be done in particular circumstances (Meiorin at para 64).\n[107] One approach to exploring the accommodation of individual capabilities suggested in Meiorin is to consider whether different ways of performing the job were available. The evidence in the present case precludes this possibility. All of the work to be performed by the fishers was to be at sea, whether as deckhands, first mates, or captains. The hazards and risks linked to fishing on the water cannot be dissociated from the job tasks of these positions. Mr. Johnstone testified that even people with other occupations on some commercial fishing vessels, such as cooks, are exposed to similar hazards and risks as other crew members. They are expected to contribute along with all crew members if an emergency arises while at sea. Moreover, they may be subject to particular hazards related to their specific job, such as fire or explosion from the fuels and ingredients used to cook. In any event, I have no evidence before me of any jobs other than deckhands, first mates, and captains, being available on the water, at the EFWC.\n[108] Mr. Dennis contends that the EFWC should offer alternate employment in non-safety sensitive positions to those who test positive, at least for the period during which they may be receiving counselling and treatment for their substance dependency. He even went so far as to suggest that if no other jobs are available, these fishers should continue to receive some compensation while in treatment.\n[109] Mr. Johnston, the EFWC Executive Director, testified that aside from the fishing crews, the commercial fishery has a staff of about ten people working during the busy fishing season, most of whom are laid off at the end of the season. These positions include two monitors who perform security functions on the docks, two dispatchers or call out persons, one person who organizes the work schedule, and one person who moves the traps and lines around on the dock. There are also a number of employees with science backgrounds involved in the EFWC's research section as well as three full-time bookkeepers\/accountants. Mr. Leonard Denny, the commercial fishery manager, testified that even in the summer, the commercial fishery runs a tight ship in terms of staffing, consisting of the fishers and the few above-mentioned employees. No other jobs are available.\n[110] I am satisfied by the Band's evidence that it has no alternative employment to offer in the commercial fishery to persons who fail their drug screening test, and that it would be unreasonable to expect the Band to either create jobs or simply pay fishers a salary while they are in treatment for their dependencies (see Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d'Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP-FTQ), 2000 SCC 43 at paras. 15-18; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Human Rights Tribunal), [1997] F.C.J. No. 1734 (Q.L.)(T.D.) (Dumont-Ferlatte) at para. 44). It is important to note that the fishers like Mr. Dennis are not indeterminate employees although they have the opportunity to be rehired each year. The compensation that the fishers receive is generated by the sale of the seafood that they catch. The commercial fishery does not have another source of income. More importantly, the evidence is clear that the commercial fishery was established with the mission of generating employment and revenues for the Band and its members; it was not meant to serve as a replacement for the Band's social assistance program.\nf) Does the policy place an undue burden on employees? [111] Mr. Dennis argued that the Band's drug testing policy placed an undue burden on those to whom it applied, which according to Meiorin at para. 65, is one factor that can be considered in assessing whether a policy is reasonably necessary. He emphasized the unfairness to persons like him who may test positive in their test and were denied employment, but who in fact were never previously observed working while impaired.\n[112] However, even if an employer's policy is viewed by some as unfair, it does not necessarily result in a breach of the Canadian Human Rights Act. As the Tribunal in Milazzo, at para. 180, pointed out, the fact that an employee tests positive in an employer-sponsored drug test does not automatically mean that the employee is disabled and therefore entitled to the protection of the Act.\n[113] The opportunity to re-test, obtain an assessment and receive treatment available under the Fit to Work policy stands in stark contrast to the component of the policy in Milazzo that was the basis on which the Tribunal found that the policy in that case did not satisfy the Act's requirements. In that case, prospective employees suffering from drug related disabilities saw their offers of employment simply withdrawn, without first addressing the issue of accommodation, a practice that the Tribunal held employers were not entitled to pursue. The Tribunal contrasted the treatment of prospective employees with the opportunity afforded to existing employees who came forward and informed the employer of their drug or alcohol problem. The employer allowed such workers to rehabilitate themselves and return to work. The Tribunal suggested that at a minimum, a similar form of accommodation should be extended to prospective employees.\n[114] In the present case, I note that the Fit to Work policy is significantly more accommodating to prospective employees than the policy that was at issue in Milazzo. As such, the policy reflects the guidance given in Meiorin, at para 68, that the standard set by the employer should itself provide for individual accommodation, if reasonably possible. The policy states that individuals who tested positive could take the test again. Mr. Maloney testified that such persons were given a document explaining the nature of the testing and what circumstances would yield positive results. This provided them with the information they needed to adjust their practices, pass the next drug-screening test, and enable them to get back to work. An employee who failed again could re-test two more times before being definitively turned down for employment, but the bar to employment would only last until the following year. The employee would in the process be encouraged or required, depending on the number of drug testing failures, to seek assessment and\/or treatment of his or her problem. As a result, the employee hopefully would succeed in the treatment and not fail the test again in the future.\n[115] I have already determined that the Band would have experienced hardship based on safety and cost were it required to have individuals who test positive in a drug-screening test work on its vessels. Accommodating these individuals through alternate employment on land or sea was not an option as there were no such jobs available. Furthermore, requiring the Band to remunerate a fisher who is not working (and therefore not generating any income for the fishery) would be unreasonable. Either of these forms of accommodation would have, in my view, unquestionably imposed undue hardship on the Band. On the other hand, the accommodation procedures that the Band incorporated into the policy were more than reasonable. Individuals were afforded ample opportunity to be re-tested during the fishing season, and whatever the outcome, they could always try again the following year.\n[116] For these reasons, I find that the Band has demonstrated that it was reasonably necessary to adopt the Fit to work policy for the accomplishment of Band's goals of protecting its employees from injury and its property from damage. Step 3 of the Meiorin analysis has been satisfied. The Band has therefore discharged its burden. Accordingly, Mr. Dennis' s. 10 complaint is dismissed.\nVI. SECTION 67 OF THE CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT [117] As part of its defence to the complaint, the Band argued that the Fit to Work policy was a measure of self governance exercised by the Band pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Act and that as such, it was exempt from the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act, pursuant to s. 67. Given my findings dismissing the complaint on other grounds, it is unnecessary to address this argument.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

REMEDIES\nV. ORDER\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] On February 11, 2004, the Canadian Human Rights Commission referred complaint H47521 to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal requesting, pursuant to section 49 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, an inquiry into the complaint.\n[2] The record shows that in fact two complaint forms were referred to the Tribunal. The original complaint form, dated May 13, 1998 indicates as the date of the alleged conduct 1992 and ongoing while the complaint form amending the complaint form signed May 13, 1998, which is dated Januray 12, 1999, indicates as the date of the alleged conduct 1993 and ongoing.\n[3] In his complaint, the Complainant, Dr. Shiv Chopra who, at all relevant times, was a drug evaluator with the Health Protection Branch at Health Canada, alleges that Health Canada discriminated against him by treating him in an adverse differential manner in the course of his employment by denying him promotional opportunities based on his race, colour and national or ethnic origin (East Indian) contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The record shows that the Complainant later alleged that he had been harassed and retaliated against by Health Canada, allegations that bring into play sections 14 and 14.1 of the Act.\n[4] The Commission was not present at the hearing. The Complainant and the Respondent were represented by Counsel.\n[5] This complaint raises legal issues which go beyond a determination of discrimination in relation to sections 7 and 10 of the Act as well as of harassment and retaliation with respect to sections 14 and 14.1 of the Act.\n[6] The record shows that, in 1992, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission which covered events that had taken place prior to September 16, 1992. This complaint was first heard by a three member panel of this Tribunal, the Soberman Tribunal, which made findings of fact that went beyond September 16, 1992.\n[7] The record shows that the decision rendered by the Soberman Tribunal was subsequently set aside by the Federal Court of Canada and another member of the Tribunal, Mr. Athanasios Hadjis, was assigned to hear new evidence. The Hadjis Tribunal made findings of fact on events that had occurred after September 16, 1992 as well as decided issues that had arisen after September 16, 1992.\n[8] At the hearing, the scope of the complaint became an issue with respect to what period of time was covered by the complaint. In addition, given the findings and rulings made by the Soberman and Hadjis Tribunals, the issue of res judicata was raised as to which issues had been judicially decided by the previous Tribunals.\n[9] Before inquiring into the substance of the complaint, i.e. the possible breach by the Respondent of sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, as well as sections 14 and 14.1 of the Act, the Tribunal will address a number of preliminary issues which may have an impact on the determination of the substantive issues.\nII. PRELIMINARY ISSUES [10] There are five preliminary issues that have to be dealt with before examining the substantive aspects of the complaint: A. the scope of the complaint, B. the findings and rulings of previous Tribunals, C. the career of Dr. Chopra at Health Canada, D. the unfair treatment of Dr. Chopra at Health Canada and E. the credibility of Dr. Chopra.\nA. The scope of the complaint [11] The record shows that, on May 13, 1998, the Complainant filed a complaint form with the Canadian Human Rights Commission bearing the number H47521. In his original complaint, the Complainant alleges that Health Canada, from 1992 and onwards, discriminated against him by treating him in an adverse differential manner throughout his employment by denying promotional opportunities based on his race, colour and national or ethnic origin contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[12] On January 12, 1999, the Complainant filed a second complaint form amending the complaint form signed on May 13, 1998, bearing the number H47521. In his amended complaint, the Complainant alleges that Health Canada, from 1993 and onwards, had discriminated against him by treating him in an adverse differential manner throughout his employment by denying promotional opportunities based on his race, colour and national or ethnic origin contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[13] At the hearing, the Complainant argued that the amended complaint form did not replace the first complaint form but amended it so as to add section 10 of the Act as an additional ground of discrimination. According to the Complainant, the time period covered by the complaint remained the same and covered the period extending from 1992 and onwards.\n[14] The Respondent argued that the second complaint in fact replaced the first one and that the time period covered by the complaint was the period extending from 1993 and onwards. The Respondent further argued that events that had taken place in 1992 had already been dealt with by previous Tribunals, the Soberman and the Hadjis Tribunals, and could not be the object of further litigation.\n[15] The fact of the matter is that the two complaint forms, both the original one dated May 13, 1998 and the amended one dated January 12, 1999 were referred to the Tribunal. The issue pertaining to the reasons that lead Dr. Chopra to sign an amended complaint form with a different date in the period box thus becomes moot; so is the issue as to whether or not the amended complaint form was meant to replace the original complaint form. As stated, both the original complaint form and the amended complaint form were referred to the Tribunal.\n[16] Furthermore, the record shows that the Complainant, after a long exchange between himself and Counsel for the Respondent in the course of his cross-examination, admitted that the period covered by the present complaint was the period extending from 1993 to 1999.\n[17] The Tribunal thus finds that both complaint forms, the original complaint form as well as the amended one, are properly before the Tribunal and that the period of time covered by the complaint extends from 1993 to 1999.\nB. The findings and rulings of previous Tribunals [18] The record shows that many events referred to in the present proceedings were the object of findings and rulings in previous decisions of this Tribunal related to the complaint brought by the Complainant against the Respondent on September 16, 1992, i.e. the Soberman and the Hadjis Tribunals, as well as by the complaint brought by the National Capital Alliance on Race Relations (NCARR) against Health Canada. For example, the record shows that the Hadjis Tribunal allowed evidence and made findings on events which were technically outside of the scope of the 1992 complaint which covered events up to September of 1992, notably events which occurred in 1993 and 1994.\n[19] Before the start of this hearing, the Respondent brought a motion asking the Tribunal to strike out certain aspects of the complaint given the findings of Mr. Hadjis in Chopra v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 20 (QL) as well as in National Capital Alliance on Race Relations (NCARR) v. Canada (Health and Welfare), [1997] C.H.R.D. No. 3 (QL). The Tribunal was reluctant to remove certain aspects of the complaint. However, the Tribunal considered different allegations and made a series of rulings.\n[20] The Tribunal finds that it is bound by previous findings and rulings of this Tribunal, notably those made by the following members: Soberman, Sinclair, Hadjis and Groarke and that, in as much as issues have already been considered and decided upon by other members of this Tribunal, these issues cannot be relitigated. They however form part of the history of the human rights litigation between the parties. They provide the background to the current complaint. This said, providing some background or context to the present complaint does not mean relitigating issues which have already been decided upon.\n[21] The Tribunal finds, after carefully reviewing the Soberman and Hadjis decisions, and given the issues that were raised in the present proceedings, that the following events need to be considered to assess their inclusion in or exclusion of the issues that the Tribunal has to rule upon: 1. the Drennan complaint, 2. the Liston comments, 3. the Gunner incident, 4. the Scott appointment.\n(i) The Drennan complaint [22] In the particulars to his amended complaint form, the Complainant states that some time in 1993 (sic), Dr. W.G. Drennan, Dr. M.S. Wong (sic), Dr. L. Ritter and an unnamed human resources officer planned to personally defame him by setting him up for a spurious charge of negligence of duty. According to the Complainant, the negligence charge was to be used in his performance appraisal and resulted in two grievances and an external investigation. The Complainant further alleges that when this was discovered, there was no impact on the perpetrators involved, nor did he receive an apology.\n[23] The record shows that in his 2001 decision, Mr. Hadjis dealt with the complaint made by Dr. Drennan against Dr. Chopra in 1990. The record indicates that Dr. Chopra only learned about the existence of the complaint in 1993 pursuant to an Access to Information request which he had filed.\n[24] With respect to the Drennan complaint, the record shows that on July 23, 1990, Dr. Drennan who worked at the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, filed a complaint against Dr. Chopra about the emergency release of a drug. The complaint was documented in a memorandum addressed to Dr. Yong, Chief of the Human Safety Division, and had been put in Dr. Chopra's personal file. The complaint alleged that, on July 11, 1990, Dr. Drennan had confronted Dr. Chopra regarding the latter having failed to proceed promplty with the issuance of a certain drug to treat poultry in Saskatchewan. The records shows that, apparently, Dr. Yong concluded, at the time, that the complaint was unfounded and that Dr. Chopra had not acted inappropriately. Dr. Yong therefore did not, the record shows, follow up on the memorandum, but unfortunately, it remained in Dr. Chopra's file. Several months after the memorandum was sent, Dr. Yong informed Dr. Chopra of the complaint during the preparation of his 1990-91 performance appraisal, but Dr. Chopra apparently had no knowledge that the memorandum had found its way into his personal file (Hadjis decision, par. 144).\n[25] In his decision, Mr. Hadjis states that Dr. Chopra's concern with this incident, as it relates to the complaint he was seized with, is that the verbal exchanges which occurred between him and Dr. Drennan, in July 1990, came only two days after Dr. Chopra had written to the Chairperson of the Public Service Commission, with a copy to Deputy Minister Catley-Carlson, voicing his concerns about employment equity in the federal public service as well as his frustration in not having been approached by Health Canada or any other government organization for a management position (Hadjis decision, par. 146.)\n[26] With respect to Dr. Chopra's concerns, Mr. Hadjis ruled that other than the short span of time between the two events, there did not appear to be any evidence to link them and noted again that the Soberman Tribunal did not refer to this evidence at all in its decision and went on to reject the suggestion that discrimination against Dr. Chopra was a factor in Dr. Drennan's complaint or that it was linked to Dr. Chopra's complaints and allegations of discrimination (Hadjis decision, par. 290).\n[27] The Tribunal finds that the issues related to the Drennan complaint have been thoroughly considered by the Hadjis Tribunal. Counsel for the Complainant acknowledged in the course of these proceedings that the complaint made by Dr. Drennan in 1990, the existence of which was discovered in December 1993, was the object of a ruling by Mr. Hadjis. Furthermore, in his ruling in Bassude v. Health Canada, 2005 CHRT 21, par. 11, Member Groarke made it clear that the parties were bound by Mr. Hadjis's findings.\n[28] Hence, this Tribunal will not revisit the issues, findings and rulings pertaining to the Drennan complaint and make additional findings of fact, such as whether or not it was made in retaliation to Dr. Chopra's Employment Equity Report, whether or not it was an attempt on the part of Health Canada to discredit Dr. Chopra, whether or not it constituted boardroom racism as alleged by Counsel for the Complainant and what could have been the reasons for management at Health Canada for not informing Dr. Chopra of the existence of the complaint and rule on them. All the findings and non-findings made by Mr. Hadjis in his decision about the Drennan complaint are res judicata.\n(ii) The Liston comments [29] The record shows that the comments made by Dr. Liston about Dr. Chopra in September 1992, and which are captured in a memo written by Ms. Shirley Cuddihy, referred to as the Cuddihy memo, were considered by the Hadjis Tribunal.\n[30] It stems from the Hadjis decision that, in September 1992, the Deputy Minister at Health Canada requested from the Human Resources Directorate the opinion of senior management as to why Dr. Chopra had not been promoted to management levels, and Ms. Shirley Cuddihy, Chief of Staff Relations Operations in the Human Resources Directorate, was assigned to this task.\n[31] The record shows that Ms. Cuddihy met with Dr. Liston, the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Health Protection Branch at that time, and that the latter made the following comments which became part of the memo she sent to her supervisor, Mr. Rod Ballantyne:\nAs promised, my notes from my conversations with Drs. Liston and Somers.\nDr. Liston provided comments of both a broad nature and as well relating specifically to S. Chopra\nGeneral\nEmployees who are being considered solely for technical positions seem to fare better than when being considered for management positions. The cultural differences are minimized when we are only looking for the scientific approach. However when we start looking for the soft skills such as communicating, influencing, negotiating - quite often their cultural heritage has not emphasized these areas and they are at a disadvantage.\nAbilities to intereact (sic) with a number of stakeholders, such as industry as well as internally with peers, subordinates and superiors are important. As well we do business in the North American Way - consensus reaching model which to some cultures is very foreign.\nDr. Liston has apparently had a number of discussions with Ivy Williams on the issue. There is however a bit of a paradox in highlighting what we consider needs to be changed because we run the risk of having to defend ourselves against charges of assimilation. He suggests that we need to provide minority groups with training - we need to point them in a direction of a mirror and say: because of your cultural background, you need to communicate better or adopt a less authoritarian style. It is not a color but a culture problem nor is it a Branch or even a department but appears to be most common in departments such as ours which are technically\/scienfically oriented.\nSpecific relating to S. Chopra\nHe is authoritative.\nHe saw in (Shiv Chopra) a great textbook knowledge and thought he could build on the soft skills. (Shiv Chopra) had a confrontational style the effects of which became apparent only sometime after his arrival in the staff position reporting to Dr. Liston. People avoided him after a period rather that being being (sic) challenged by him.\n(Shiv Chopra) is not a negotiator - he doesn't make allies easily.\nHe has not placed himself in a position for grooming to senior management level positions.\n[32] The record shows that the Cuddihy memo was not disclosed at the time to Dr. Chopra. Dr. Chopra was made aware of the existence of the memo and got a copy of it through a request under the Access to Information Act. The record shows that Mr. Hadjis dealt extensively with the comments made by Dr. Liston in 1992 and made findings of facts as well as reached certain conclusions as to the impact of the comments on Dr. Chopra's career.\n[33] With respect to the Cuddihy memo, the Hadjis Tribunal found that it could be reasonably inferred from the opinions expressed by the Assistant Deputy Minister in the memo that a link between the Respondent's actions in staffing the Director's position and a prohibited ground of discrimination had been established (Hadjis decision, par. 269). The Hadjis Tribunal also found that the Cuddihy Memo accurately reflected the substance of Ms. Cuddihy's conversation with Dr. Liston and that Dr. Liston's declarations revealed an underlying assumption that persons of differing cultures may not be well-suited for senior management, because their soft skills such as communicating, influencing, negotiating have not been emphasized in their cultural heritage, thereby placing them at a disadvantage (Hadjis decision, par. 269, 272).\n[34] The Tribunal concluded that the remarks made by Dr. Liston were obviously related to the visible minority groups working within Health Canada who are of diverse national or ethnic origins, including persons of South Asian origin like Dr. Chopra (Hadjis decision, par. 271) and that Dr. Liston's specific comments regarding Dr. Chopra reflected his perception of him as being one of those minority employees who lacked the soft skills needed for management (Hadjis decision, par. 275).\n[35] Hence, this Tribunal will not revisit the issues, findings and rulings pertaining to the Cuddihy memo and make additional findings of fact, such as whether or not Health Canada dealt properly with Dr. Liston, whether or not the conduct of Health Canada managers constitute boardroom racism. All the findings and non-findings made by Mr. Hadjis in his decision about the Cuddihy memo are res judicata and cannot be relitigated before this Tribunal. To rule otherwise would mean that parties who are not satisfied with the ruling of a Tribunal could, at their leisure, relitigate issues ad infinitum. This is contrary to the sound administration of justice.\n(iii) The Gunner incident [36] Even though this incident fell outside the scope of the complaint brought by Dr. Chopra in September 1992, the record shows that the Hadjis Tribunal dealt with this matter.\n[37] In his 2001 decision, Mr. Hadjis dealt with the Gunner incident in the following manner:\nPar. 143\nDr. Chopra contends that a defamatory remark was made against him by Dr. Gunner, in 1993, subsequent to the filing of this human rights complaint and he considers this event to constitute additional circumstantial evidence of boardroom racism being practiced against him. Apparently, some time after the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs was assigned to the Food Directorate, the Director-General, Dr. Gunner, met with the PIPSC steward, Mr. D.R. Carsorso, and inquired as to the existence of any union problems at the Bureau. During this conversation, Dr. Gunner questionned Mr. Carsorso about Dr. Chopra's case (What about Shiv Chopra?) In a subsequent group meeting of several members of the union, Mr. Casorso recounted the elements of this discussion, including the reference to the Complainant. Dr. Chopra was upset that personal matters about him were not raised directly with him and consequently, filed a grievance seeking a recognition of the inappropriateness of Dr. Gunner's conduct toward him. Following an apology by Mr. Casorso, and as a gesture of good faith, Dr. Chopra later withdrew his grievance.\nPar. 289\nIn addition, there is no evidence to support Dr. Chopra'a submission that discrimination was a factor in the 1993 incident involving a union steward nor that it was even in retaliation to the complaints which he had lodged against the Respondent. Clearly, by that time, the issues raised by Dr. Chopra and other public servants, through NCARR, had created some measure of conflict between those employees and their employers. In this context, it would not have been inappropriate for a newly appointed Director-General to inquire into these issues or to even refer to these disputes as a problem. With regard to this matter as well, the Soberman Tribunal did not make any findings.\n[38] The record shows that the Hadjis Tribunal dealt thoroughly with the Gunner incident and made findings that this Tribunal cannot ignore. This matter is for all intent and purposes res judicata and this Tribunal will not consider it any further except as part of the context to the current complaint. The Tribunal notes here that the Hadjis Tribunal found that the conduct of Dr. Gunner had not been discriminatory.\n(iv) The Scott appointment [39] Even though the appointment of Dr. Scott to the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, fell outside the scope of the complaint brought by Dr. Chopra in September 1992, the record shows that this matter was considered by the Hadjis Tribunal.\n[40] The following paragraphs of the Hadjis decision need to be referred to in order to determine the findings and rulings made by Mr. Hadjis in relation to the Scott appointment:\nPara. 136\nIn the complaint, Dr. Chopra alleges that he was treated unfairly in the manner in which his performance appraisals were prepared during this 1990 to 1992 period, and that he believes that he received this treatment because of his colour, race and national or ethnic origin. In his final arguments, Counsel for the Commission also referred to another competition in 1993, as well as an incident involving a union steward and a grievance filed against the Complainant, subsequent to the filing of the human rights complaint, as evidence of ongoing discrimination. I note that aside from the performance appraisals issue, these matters were not referred to by the Soberman Tribunal in its decision, even though all of the evidence relating thereto was presented in the first set of hearing.\nPara. 141\nIn December 1993, Dr. Chopra applied for the competition to fill the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, classified at the EX-02 level. He testified that he had viewed the poster advertising this competition prior to submitting his application. His candidacy was screened out by the screening board which determined that he did not meet two of the three experience factors listed on the statement of qualifications for the position: (i) experience in managing a scientific or medical or veterinary organization with multi-faceted programs, and (ii) experience as a departmental representative with outside organisations including media and international organizations. With respect to the first criterion, his experience was not considered recent, as required by the screening guide set up by the screening board, and regarding the second qualification, it was determined that there was no evidence of his having had any experience in dealing with the media on behalf of Health Canada. Dr. Timothy Scott was found to be the only fully qualified candidate and was appointed to the position.\nPara. 142\nDr. Chopra appealled the appointment alleging that his qualifications and those of Dr. T. Scott were not adequately assessed. On November 14, 1994, Ms. Helen Barkley of the Public Service Commission Appeal Board dismissed the appeal. In her ruling, Ms. Barkley found that Dr. Chopra's dealing with the media were as a private citizen and on social issues, not as a departmental representative, and that, in any event, he did not have the managerial experience required for the position. She further held that she found no evidence of bias on the part of either of the screening board members, Ms. Francine Krueger of the PSC and Dr. Saul Gunner, the Director General of the Food Directorate, under which was located the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs.\nPara. 288\nI also do not find that Dr. Chopra was the victim of adverse differential treatment with respect to the December 1993 competition for the position of Director - Bureau of Veterinary Drugs. Although he was screened out for lack of recent management experience, he was also deemed to lack the second qualification of experience in dealing with outside organizations. No evidence was adduced to indicate the Dr. Chopra did in fact possess the latter qualification nor that his lacking this experience was related to discrimination by the Respondent. I am satisfied that Dr. Chopra was not qualified for the position, and that consequently, the Shakes test (the prima facie test) has not been met.\n[41] In Bassude v. Health Canada, 2005 CHRT 21, Member Groarke ruled with respect to the Scott appointment that the issue had already been litigated.\n[42] At the hearing, Counsel for the Complainant argued, however, that the Hadjis Tribunal did not consider what had happened after corrective measures were ordered following the successful appeal of Dr. Casorso and asked the Tribunal to address this matter. In response to this argument, the Respondent argued that the whole issue of Dr. Scott's appointment was res judicata, stating that the facts were basically the same in both instances (initial competition and subsequent competition). The Complainant disputed the fact that there was res judicata because the issues were not the same even though the facts may be the same.\n[43] The record shows that, on March 3, 2006, this Tribunal ruled on a formal objection made by the Respondent to the introduction by the Complainant of evidence on the selection process leading to the appointment of Dr. Timothy Scott to the position of Director, BVD (Basudde v. Health Canada), 2006 CHRT 10:\nPar. 28 This said, the Tribunal cannot, however, ignore the fact that, in his decision, Mr. Hadjis did make findings of fact in connection with allegations of discrimination related to events which were outside the 1990-1992 period, namely the appointment of Dr. Scott to the position of Director, BVD.\nPar. 29 In this respect, Mr. Hadjis found that Dr. Chopra was not the victim of adverse differential treatment with regard to the December 1993 competition for the position of Director, BVD. Mr. Hadjis further found that no evidence was adduced indicating that Dr. Chopra did, in fact, possess the qualification or experience in dealing with outside organizations (Hadjis decision, par. 288). On this basis, Mr. Hadjis concluded that Dr. Chopra was not qualified for the position and that there was no prima facie case of discrimination.\nPar. 30 Even if these findings can be said to be only incidental to the core issue which Mr. Hadjis had to decide, i.e. the staffing of the position of Director, BVD, they still remain findings of fact made by Mr. Hadjis that I cannot ignore.\nPar. 33 The Tribunal thus finds that the period covered by the complaint filed by Dr. Chopra in 1992 was that of 1990 to 1992, more precisely September 16, 1992, the date of the filing of the complaint, that additional allegations of discrimination were raised in the course of the second hearing by Mr. Hadjis of the 1992 complaint, notably allegations of discrimination in relation to the selection process of December 1993 leading to the appointment of Dr. Scott as Director, BVD, that these allegations, although incidental and not part of the scope of the complaint filed in 1992, led to certain findings of fact by Mr. Hadjis, that these findings cannot be ignored by the Tribunal but must be put in the context of the 1992 complaint and of Mr. Hadjis' analysis of the December 1993 competition.\nPar. 34 In his analysis of the evidence pertaining to the 1993 competition (Hadjis decision, para. 141-142), Mr. Hadjis only considered the facts related to the initial competition. He did not deal with the corrective measures that were implemented after Dr. Casorso was successful in his appeal. Nor did he deal with the events that took place after the implementation of these corrective measures and with any allegation of discrimination related to events that followed the implementation of the corrective measures.\nPar. 35 The Tribunal therefore finds that events which took place after the PSAB decision in November 1994 were not considered, nor decided, by Mr. Hadjis in his decision. His findings of fact are limited to the initial 1993 competition and do not cover the overall process pertaining to the staffing of the position of Director BVD.\nPar. 36 On this point, the Tribunal disagrees with Respondent's assertion that the corrective measures put in place after the Carsorso decision are subsumed in the overall selection process of a Director for the BVD, process which started in December 1993 and ended in February 1995 with the confirmation of Dr. Scott as Director, BVD.\n[44] Given the Tribunal previous decision on the matter of the appointment of Dr. Scott, the Tribunal will consider as part of this complaint the events which occurred after corrective measures were ordered following Dr. Carsoso's successful appeal.\nC. The career of Dr. Chopra at Health Canada [45] Dr. Chopra is of East Indian descent. He started working at Health Canada in 1969. In 1987, he became a drug evaluator in the Human Safety Division of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs at a VM-4 level. His employment at Health Canada was terminated in 2004.\n[46] The record shows that during the period of time he worked at Health Canada, Dr. Chopra had acting positions twice, in 1988 and in 1996. Firstly, the evidence shows that Dr. Chopra acted as Chief of the Human Safety Divison, in 1988 for a period of six weeks or so, before Dr. Yong was appointed Chief, and afterwards, off and on whenever he was asked to, up to about 1992. Secondly, the evidence shows that Dr. Chopra acted as Chief, C.N.S. Division, for a period of four months at the end of 1996 and in early 1997 (October 7, 1996 to February 7, 1997) and that as Chief of C.N.S. and Endocrine Drugs Division, on occasion he acted as Director of the Bureau of Veterinany Drugs, a few days here and there.\n[47] Asked if anyone within the Department expressed concerns about his performance when he acted in the position of Chief or Director, on certain occasions, Dr. Chopra testified that not at all, that no one in the Department or outside the Department complained about his acting as Director or Chief.\n[48] The record shows that as early as 1979, Dr. Chopra started showing interest in being provided opportunities to acquire experience in more senior management responsibilities. His annual appraisals before joining the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, while with the Bureau of Drugs, state that management related training programs are recommended for this employee in order to enhance his career aspirations and that he had received extensive management training.\n[49] The following comments appear in his 1979 evaluation, signed by Dr. Ian Henderson: It is obvious that this employee's interests for the future lie in the area of policy-making and management. He has been acting de facto as a Section Head for the specialty of immunology, but this has not been formalized in his job description, nor in terms of his compensation. He is somewhat frustrated by his inability to rise within the management structure of the Health Protection Branch, and is presently looking for an opportunity to enter a management career path, while attempting to maintain his expertise in the scientific discipline of immunology.\n[50] In his 1980-1981 appraisal, it is stated that Dr. Chopra has received extensive management training, while his 1981-82 appraisal states that he has gained extensive management training.\n[51] In relation to his 1981-1982 appraisal, it is mentioned that this employee has received extensive training in Management skills including a Diploma in Senior Management Development from the Public Service Commission and that the full potential of this employee remains underutilized, that in spite of extensive formal training and experience in management systems and a rare insight into international regulatory control of health care products, no visible career advancement has been possible. Nevertheless, the employee has managed to contain his frustration and continues to maintain his initiative and drive in typical professional manner. These comments are repeated in his 1982-1983 appraisal.\n[52] In his 1986-87 appraisal, it is stated that when provided the opportunity, Dr. Chopra acts as a competent manager. In his 1987-1988 second to last annual appraisal before joining the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, it is written that Dr. Chopra has wide experience in regulatory affairs and has demonstrated his ability to handle delicate situations requiring both scientific knowledge, tact and good writing skills, that he has the potential for advancement to a higher level in the service and that his aspirations should be met. In his l990 appraisal, signed by Drs. Yong and Messier, it is stated that Dr. Chopra has the potential to achieve his career aspirations (management). He is encouraged to pursue the DAP program initiative. His later appraisals are more sketchy.\n[53] The record shows that, in 1991, Dr. Chopra reiterated his interest in being provided opportunities to acquire experience in more senior management to Health Canada officials, Mr. Ballantyne and Dr. Liston. The evidence shows that Dr. Chopra expressed his concern regarding, what he believed, was the denial of these opportunities. He expressed the opinion in the course of his testimony that the Department was giving opportunities (i.e. line management experience) to everybody else but him.\n[54] Dr. Chopra stated time and time again in his testimony that he met all the qualifications required for a managerial position and that, in his opinion, given his past appraisals, he was better fitted that anybody else to occupy managerial positions, i.e. Chief or Director. The evidence shows that Dr. Chopra was told in that respect that he was lacking recent line management experience.\n[55] It is worth noting with respect to Dr. Chopra's career progression that Mr. Hadjis made the following findings in his 2001 decision:\n[261] Over this same 1969 to 1987 period, the Complainant claims that he was not provided with the appropriate advice and assistance from the employer, to acquire the management experience required for a senior management position. Dr. Chopra was advised as early as 1974 to register for career advancement opportunities such as the CAP and later, the DAP. The evidence shows that the Complainant did not follow up on these recommendations.\n[262] The Soberman Tribunal held that such responsibilities cannot properly be left entirely to the employee within such a large bureaucracy and that the Respondent's insensitivity increased Dr. Chopra's level of frustration and eventually led to his suspicions that racial discrimination played a role in his being passed over. Nonetheless, the first Tribunal found that these findings do not demonstrate prima facie discrimination. However, I would add that the new evidence led before me reinforced the point that ultimately the responsibility to seek out and obtain such training and other advancement opportunities is the employee's. I therefore find that no inference of discrimination on the part of the Respondent can be drawn from these circumstances.\nD. The unfair treatment of Dr. Chopra [56] In support of the allegations that the Complainant was discriminated against, Counsel for the Complainant relied on a number of situations where, he asserts, the Complainant was treated unfairly by Health Canada when compared to how Health Canada dealt with other employees. In his submissions, Counsel for the Complainant asserted that these situations should be considered as more than the unfair treatment of Dr. Chopra compared to the treatment of other individuals, but also as retaliation or harassment under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[57] Given that the Tribunal has already decided not to examine events or issues that have already been considered by previous Tribunals, the events that the Tribunal considers relevant to the present proceedings are 1. the Zohair complaint, 2. the Elanco complaint, 3. the suspension imposed on Dr. Chopra by Dr. Lachance in 1999 and 4. the exclusion of Dr. Chopra from certain projects.\n[58] Except for the Elanco complaint, the Zohair complaint, Dr. Chopra's suspension and his exclusion from certain projects are not identified in the complaint forms or the additional allegations as incidents of discrimination, the Zohair complaint and Dr. Chopra's suspension having occurred after the filing of the complaints forms and the additional allegations in June 1999.\n(i) The Zohair complaint [59] The record shows that, in July 1999, Ms. Shaida Zohair, the secretary to the Chief of the Human Safety Division where Dr. Chopra was an evaluator, made a harassment complaint against Dr. Chopra. Health Canada ordered that an independent investigation be carried out. The investigator concluded that Dr. Chopra may have been guilty of arrogance, insensitivity or condescending behavior, but neither the frequency - three incidents alone over a one-year period - nor the nature - neither momentous nor grave - of the actions sufficiently constitute a pattern of behaviour that would support a definition of harassment. The evidence shows that Dr. Chopra was imposed a reprimand by the Director General of the Food Directorate and that Dr. Chopra grieved that decision. The evidence further shows that Dr. Chopra's grievance was upheld by the Assistant Deputy Minister who ordered that the letter of reprimand be removed from Dr. Chopra's file.\n[60] Counsel for the Complainant stated in his oral submissions that he relied on the Zohair complaint for two specific reasons: firstly, to show how Dr. Chopra learned about the complaint - the complaint was made in July 1999 and Dr. Chopra was informed only in September 1999, - and secondly, how complaints against Dr. Chopra were dealt with compared to complaints made by Dr. Chopra.\n[61] On this aspect, the evidence shows that Dr. Chopra learned about the complaint through the investigator. Nobody, it appears, within the Department had informed Dr. Chopra about the complaint. No explanation was provided. The evidence shows also that Dr. Chopra was entitled to be advised about the complaint soon after it had been filed.\n[62] For the purpose of these proceedings, the Tribunal cannot derive from this event more than a finding that the Department had the complaint investigated, that a reprimand was imposed on Dr. Chopra, that the latter successfully grieved the reprimand. Given the submissions made by Counsel for the Complainant, the Tribunal will have to consider if the Zohair complaint constitutes retaliation or harassment on the part of Health Canada.\n[63] More troubling however is the assertion that Dr. Chopra made in the course of his testimony when he stated that Ms. Zohair's complaint was contrived by the Department, that Ms. Zohair was motivated by the Department to have a conflict with him. This assertion remained throughout the hearing an unproven allegation which, given its unproven nature, undermines the credibility of the Complainant in relation to some of the assertions he makes.\n(ii) The Elanco complaint [64] In the particulars to his amended complaint form, the Complainant alleges that, in early 1997, he was again slandered and defamed by Drs. G. Paterson and D. Landry, through false accusations of unacceptable behaviour towards Elanco, a pharmaceutical company, at a BVD meeting, which resulted in a counter complaint and a threat of legal action but that nothing has again be (sic) done about the perpetrators.\n[65] The Elanco incident has to do with a letter sent by a representative of a pharmaceutical company, Dr. Dicks, who complained about a meeting attended by Dr. Chopra and BVD evaluators while Dr. Chopra was acting Chief CNS in February 1997. Dr. Chopra testified that he considered the letter an attack on his reputation. He further testified that the Department, not only was not supportive of him, but that by sending copies of the letter to different individuals within Health Canada, the Department contributed to the sullying of his reputation. The evidence shows that Dr. Chopra was told that the letter would not be used to his detriment. In fact, Dr. Chopra was never disciplined with respect to this incident.\n[66] The evidence shows that, after receiving the complaint letter, the General Manager, Dr. Paterson, wrote to Elanco and stated that the matter should not be exacerbated. The decision made by Health Canada to try to defuse the situation did not sit well with Dr. Chopra who wanted the Department to sanction Dr. Dick and require from him an apology. Given the inaction of Health Canada, Dr. Chopra filed a grievance and asked for an investigation. The Department decided, after the grievance had been heard, to investigate the matter further. However, it put a stop to the investigation when Dr. Chopra indicated that he would not fully participate in the investigation.\n[67] The Tribunal fails to see how issues of defamation are covered by the Canadian Human Rights Act. This said, the Elanco incident was the object of much discussion and debate in these proceedings. At the hearing, Dr. Chopra made a link between the Department handling of the complaint and the issue of discrimination. The lack of a proper response on the part of Health Canada to Dr. Dick's complaint would be the discriminatory act. According to Complainant's Counsel, the Department's attitude in dealing with the Elanco complaint is part and parcel of the discrimination Dr. Chopra experienced over the years at Health Canada. When Dr. Chopra's career is affected by a negative comments, he asserts, nothing or little is done about it.\n[68] The Tribunal finds that the initial allegation of defamation brought against the Respondent with respect to the Elanco complaint does not fall under the purview of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Furthermore, the Tribunal notes that, at the time of the event, Dr. Chopra never complained of any discrimination on the part of anyone. Nevertheless, given the allegation made by the Complainant, the Tribunal will consider the Elanco complaint incident with respect to the issues of discrimination and retaliation.\n(iii) The suspension imposed on Dr. Chopra by Dr. Lachance [69] The record shows that, on March 26, 1999, Dr. Chopra attended Heritage Canada's Employment Equity Annual Meeting as a panelist. According to the summary of the proceedings put in evidence, Dr. Chopra made the comment that he had personally been involved in the fight against racism in the Public Service for the last ten years and that during that period, he had not seen any improvement despite what delegates may have heard from other presenters at this annual meeting. Dr. Chopra stated in his testimony that he was then expressing a concern from his personal experiences following the NCARR decision as well as his deep dissatisfaction with respect to how the Department applied the NCARR order. In his view, nothing was happening.\n[70] The record also shows that Dr. Chopra sent a five line abstract to the organizers of the conference in which Dr. Chopra states that the results collected since 1987 show that the effect that the Employment Equity Act and the other relevant Acts have produced is to perpetuate racism without check and that indications are that this same situation will continue well beyond Y2K.\n[71] A few months after the conference, the record shows that Dr. Lachance sent a letter to Dr. Chopra, letter dated July 21, 1999. In his letter, Dr. Lachance refers to a quote taken, it appears, from an audio tape recording of the proceedings where Dr. Chopra would have said: after three years in Health Canada, you heard from our Human Resources Director General yesterday, Bob Joubert. Every word, everything I can tell you now, I wasn't there, would be a lie because there is nothing happening in HC, and we at NCARR - it must be noted here that Dr. Chopra was at one point in time a member of NCARR - are considering filing a charge of contempt of court against all three departments, Treasury Board, Public Service Commission and Health Canada.\n[72] In his testimony, Dr. Chopra did not deny that he would have said that he had not seen any improvement. He however denied at first having said that Mr. Joubert was a liar, then stated that he could not deny or substantiate whether he had said this or not because he had no way of knowing. Dr. Chopra however stated that if someone from the Department stated that everything had been sorted out and that there were no further problems, this would be a lie.\n[73] The evidence shows that Dr. Lachance imposed on Dr. Chopra a five-day suspension without pay in relation to this incident, that Dr. Chopra filed a grievance with the Public Service Staff Relations Board arising from this incident. The evidence shows that Dr. Chopra's grievance proceeded to adjudication, that his grievance was at first denied by the Assistant Deputy Minister, but later upheld by the Public Service Staff Relations Board. The adjudicator ordered the employer to rescind the suspension, remit to Dr. Chopra the monies related to this suspension and to remove from Dr. Chopra's file all documents relating to this suspension. Dr. Chopra testified that the Department never apologized to him for having disciplined him for having made the comments he did.\n[74] In his submissions, Counsel for the Complainant stated that the issue here is how the Department deals with Dr. Chopra's concerns. Here is a situation where Dr. Chopra speaks about racism in the public service and where the Department, through Dr. Lachance, instead of sitting down with Dr. Chopra to discuss the issue, disciplines him. For Counsel for the Complainant, the message sent by the Department is that the Department will not tolerate public discussion or criticism of itself on questions of discrimination.\n[75] Counsel for the Complainant further indicated to the Tribunal that it was his position that, by imposing on Dr. Chopra a five-day suspension, the Department, more specifically Dr. Lachance, was retaliating against Dr. Chopra for making certain comments in a public forum. Counsel for the Complainant added that it was his position that the Department did not like what Dr. Chopra said about the Department and that this is why the Department slapped him with a suspension. For Complainant's Counsel, this is discrimination.\n[76] Given these allegations, the Tribunal will consider if the suspension imposed by Dr. Lachance on Dr. Chopra in 1999 was a discriminatory act and constitutes retaliation in relation to the filing of a complaint.\n(iv) The exclusion of Dr. Chopra from certain projects [77] The record shows that Dr. Chopra was excluded from certain scientific reviews conducted within the Human Safety Division of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs in 1991 (Ractopamine) and 1993 (Flumequine). Dr. Chopra stated in his testimony that it was never explained to him why he was excluded.\n[78] In the course of his cross-examination with respect to these events, Dr. Chopra was asked whether or not he considered his exclusion as discrimination or retaliation on the part of Health Canada. The Tribunal finds that the answer provided by Dr. Chopra at the time was, to say the least, unclear, although Dr. Chopra did state at one point in his testimony that he did not see that as discrimination but retaliation, adding that he felt he was being targeted by Health Canada for having complained about racism. Counsel for the Complainant argued that the exclusion of Dr. Chopra from the Flumequine study is an example of some of the opportunities that were denied to Dr. Chopra for no apparent reasons.\n[79] The Soberman and Hadjis Tribunals don't seem to have dealt with this matter, i.e. the exclusion of Dr. Chopra from certain projects under the auspices of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs. In any event, his exclusion from the Ractopamine project should have been dealt with by the Soberman Tribunal which dealt with the complaint filed by Dr. Chopra in September 1992. As for the Flumequine project, it falls within the scope of this complaint. Given the nature of the allegation made by Dr. Chopra with respect to the reason of his exclusion, the Tribunal will deal with this issue within the context of an allegation of retaliation.\nE. The credibility of Dr. Chopra [80] At the outset of his submissions, Counsel for the Respondent stated that credibility was the central issue in this case and asserted that Dr. Chopra was not a credible witness given his attitude on cross-examination, his general demeanor, the use of sweeping statements, the contradictory evidence he provided, the allegations of conspiracy he made.\n[81] To support these assertions, Counsel for the Respondent referred to the fact that Dr. Chopra refused to answer certain questions and was evasive in his answers, that he gave explanations which made no sense, that some of his evidence was untrue and that Dr. Chopra was not responsive and was argumentative in many instances. This was referred to by Counsel for the Complainant as a frontal attack on Dr. Chopra.\n[82] In response to Respondent Counsel's frontal attack on the credibility of Dr. Chopra, Counsel for the Complainant undertook to put the attitude, comments, outbursts, general testimony of Dr. Chopra in the proper context of the questions asked.\n[83] In the course of his submissions, Counsel for the Respondent referred the Tribunal to the Dhanjal case (Dhanjal v. Air Canada, [1996] C.H.R.D. No 4), the Martin case (Martin v. Saulteaux Band Government, T.D. 07\/02), the Hill case (Hill v. Air Canada, [2003] C.H.R.D. No. 3) and the Singh case (Singh v. Canada (Statistics Canada), [1998] C.H.R.D. No.7 and suggested that many of the comments made in these cases about the Complainant applied directly to Dr. Chopra. Counsel for the Respondent more specifically referred to the following passages:\nDhanjal\nThe complainant's attitude on the cross-examination, which was relatively brief and properly conducted by the Respondent counsel, was revealing of this personality. He is aggressive, often tried to avoid answering questions (sic), often argued with counsel and even went so far as to refuse to answer certain questions. More than once, the Tribunal had to call him to order and instruct him to answer questions (sic) that were put to him and stop arguing with counsel. The complainant even showed a lack of respect for counsel, on one occasion at least, saying his question was idiotic instead of answering it. In short, through his attitude the complainant fully accredited the thesis of Respondent counsel that Mr. Dhanjal is an irascible individual, uncooperative and a manipulator, and that it was these personality traits that were the true cause of the problems in his working relationship with Guy Goodman (Dhanjal, par. 181).\nMartin\nI was similarly unimpressed by the evidence of Julia Night. There was a marked difference in Julia Night's demeanour between her testimony in chief and in cross-examination. In chief, Ms. Night appeared quite pleasant and friendly, whereas her responses in cross-examination were often defensive, and, at times, quite aggressive. Ms. Night demonstrated a surprising degree of hostility towards Commission counsel, considering that her involvement in the matters giving rise to Ms. Martin's complaint was peripheral, and that her conduct was not in issue in this proceeding (Martin, par. 102).\nHill\nMr. Hill was a partial witness, whose feelings often obscured his view of the facts. He had a tendency to reduce everything to a common denominator: that denominator was that he had not been treated fairly. I nevertheless found that Mr. Hill's behaviour in the hearing room was inherently aggressive. I understand his feelings of injustice, but he was clearly inaccurate or mistaken on a number of counts and was unwilling to recognize that there was a case on the other side. (Hill, par. 11-12)\nSingh\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that Mr. Singh honestly believes that he has been the victim of age discrimination as well as discrimination relating to his national or ethnic origin throughout most of his employment with Statistics Canada; indeed, his outrage at his perceived treatment at the hands of the respondent was palpable throughout his testimony. In the course of his testimony, however, Mr. Singh would often make sweeping statements where it appeared that he thought that it would advance his case. While he would usually retreat from these statements when pressed, this tendency does raise concerns as to Mr. Singh's reliability as a witness (Singh, par. 169).\n[84] After hearing Dr. Chopra's testimony, there can be no doubt that Dr. Chopra is angry and bitter against Health Canada, that he feels that he has been treated unfairly, discriminated and retaliated against and harassed. He feels that there is some form of conspiracy that exists against him at Health Canada and that Health Canada orchestrated certain events in order to make him look bad.\n[85] The Tribunal considers that, in the course of his testimony, Dr. Chopra made sweeping statements that affect his credibility or, at least, his objectivity or sense of proportion. For example, Dr. Chopra stated, in relation to the Gunner comment (What about Shiv Chopra), that he believed - he did then and he does now -- that Canadians are now racist people. But there is racism in Health Canada and the Government of Canada. As noted earlier, the comment made by Dr. Gunner was found by the Hadjis Tribunal not to be discriminatory in any way even if Dr. Chopra took offence to Dr. Gunner making it.\n[86] In the course of his testimony, Dr. Chopra expressed the view that every appointment made at Health Canada since 1977 was, in his opinion, discriminatory. Dr. Chopra went as far as asserting in his testimony, as to whether or not there were interpersonal conflicts between him and his colleagues that, these, referring to the conflicts, were engineered complaints against him by management or on behalf of management.\n[87] Of course, Dr. Chopra is entitled to his own opinions, for example, as to whether or not the Department, or his division, was functional, as to whether or not complaints were made against him personally or against the Department, as to whether or not he got along with people or colleagues. All this can be open to debate. As Counsel for the Complainant stated, these are views that Dr. Chopra holds, that he might be right or he might be wrong. This said, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that the views expressed wholehearthedly by Dr. Chopra are rooted in strong beliefs that necessarily color the views he holds with respect to Health Canada, its management, his colleagues as well as discrimination.\n[88] The Tribunal also noticed that, during the course of his cross-examination, Dr. Chopra's answers more often than not went well beyond what was required to answer a question and that Dr. Chopra had a tendency to put his own spin on things. Of course, Dr. Chopra is entitled to give a full and complete answer to the questions put to him. Nevertheless, his responses were at times a long discourse about discrimination within the Department, the lack of change, etc. Time and time again, the Tribunal had to remind Dr. Chopra to answer the question put to him and that, if he wanted to provide additional relevant information, he should do it after having answered the question.\n[89] The Tribunal noticed, moreover that, at times, Dr. Chopra did not hesitate to make statements that were devoid of any evidenciary basis, for example about. Dr. Alexander's (his job was to harass people), in relation to the Zohair complaint (Ms. Zhohair being motivated by the Department to have conflict with him), the Elanco complaint (Health Canada triggered the complaint), the Carsorso incident (what about Shiv Chopra, which Dr. Chopra related to Dr Liston's comments). These types of statements undermine the overall credibility of a witness and, in the case of Dr. Chopra, the Tribunal needs to be very cautious with respect to the views expressed by the latter, more specifically his perceptions as to the reasons which lead Health Canada to act the way it did.\n[90] After reviewing the relevant excerpts of Dr. Chopra's testimony, the Tribunal finds that Dr. Chopra had a tendency, during his testimony, to surmise or speculate about certain events rather than say that he did not know, to boast about or exaggerate his knowledge of certain matters, such as the qualifications, background and experience of colleagues or managers. Often times, in his answers, Dr. Chopra would come up with editorial comments which were not responsive to the question asked.\n[91] The Tribunal views Dr. Chopra as an opiniated person, very assertive, very sure of himself, proud, very vocal, a person who stands up for his rights, who is very committed to employment equity issues, who will not accept any form of discrimination whether blunt or subtle, who will grieve whenever he is of the view that he has not been treated fairly and that individuals have made decisions that he feels to be unreasonable, who will rarely back off even in the face of hard evidence that contradicts what he has said. The evidence also shows that, given his past experience at Health Canada and previous decisions by Human Rights Tribunals, Dr. Chopra is of the view that Health Canada officials are racists, and so are Canadians as a whole.\n[92] But Dr. Chopra is also an individual who worked in a Department that was found by a Human Rights Tribunal to have acted in a discriminatory manner with respect to visible minorities (NCARR) and which was ordered to put in place corrective measures, temporary and permanent, that address discrimination issues. Furthermore, the record shows that he was personally discriminated against by Health Canada (Hadjis Tribunal) and that events occurred behind his back while he was working at Health Canada, that negative comments were made about him without him being made aware of them (the Drennan complaint, the Cuddihy memo and Dr. Liston).\n[93] The Tribunal is of the view that, given the way Dr. Chopra conducted himself during his cross-examination, his credibility is an important if not crucial issue in this case, as argued by Counsel for the Respondent. This said, the Tribunal is nonetheless of the view that, given the special context in which this complaint was made, i.e after the NCARR decision and the Hadjis decision, the Tribunal needs to probe further the allegations made by Dr. Chopra in relation to sections 7, 10, 14 and 14.1 of the Act and look at the whole of the evidence, testimonial, documentary and circumstantial, to ascertain and determine if these articles were breached.\nIII. THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES [94] The complaint brought by Dr. Chopra against Health Canada contains a number of allegations which are related to discrimination, retaliation, harassment. Before analysing each and everyone of these allegations, it is important to set out the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act that are relevant to the analysis of these allegations as well as the relevant legal principles.\nA. The relevant provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act [95] Dr. Chopra's complaint refers to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act and, in as much as Dr. Chopra alleges harassment and retaliation on the part of his employer, to section 14 and 14.1 of the Act.\n(i) Section 7 [96] In his complaint, Dr. Chopra alleges that he has been discriminated against on the basis of his ethic origin, East Indian. Section 7 of the Act states that [i]t is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly (a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or (b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. The prohibited grounds of discrimination are set out in section 2 of the Act and are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n(ii) Section 10 [97] In his complaint, Dr. Chopra alleges systemic discrimination on the part of Health Canada and its breach of section 10 of the Act which reads: It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization (a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or (b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(iii) Section 14 [98] Dr. Chopra alleges that some of the actions taken by Health Canada against him constitute harassement. Section 14(1)(c) of the Act provides that [i]t is a discriminatory practice in matters related to employment to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(iv) Section 14.1 [99] Dr. Chopra alleges that many of the actions taken by Health Canada were retaliatory. With respect to retaliation, section 14.1 of the Act provides that [i]t is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III of the Act, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n(v) Section 65 [100] Section 65 of the Act is also worth mentioning in relation to the above mentioned sections of the Act. Section 65 (1) of the Act reads as follows: Subject to subsection (2), any act or omission committed by an officer, a director, an employee or an agent of any person, association or organization in the course of the employment of the officer, director, employee or agent shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be an act or omission committed by that person, association or organization. As for subsection (2) of the Act, it reads as follows: An act or omissions shall not, by virtue of subsection (1), be deemed to be an act or omission committed by a person, association or organization if it is established that the person, association or organization did not consent to the commission of the act or omission and exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and, subsequently, to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\nB. The relevant legal principles [101] At the outset, it is important to set out the legal principles applicable to the adjudication of issues related to discrimination, retaliation and harassment made by the Complainant against the Respondent.\n(i) Discrimination [102] In human rights cases, as well as in civil cases, the complainant or the plaintiff bears the burden of proof and must prove the allegations he or she makes on a balance of probabilities. HE WHO ALLEGES MUST PROVE. (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd. (O'Malley), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536.\n[103] This said, in proceedings before Human Rights Tribunals, the complainant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination in order to have the burden of proof shift to the respondent who then has to provide a reasonable explanation which is not a mere pretext that will convince the Tribunal that, for example, the reason for not appointing a person to a position was not motivated in any way by a prohibited ground of discrimination. As stated by Mr. Justice McIntyre in O'Malley, a prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent or, in other words, one where the evidence, if believed, and not satisfactorily explained by the respondent, will suffice for the complainant to succeed.\n[104] In Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [2005], F.C.J. No. 731, the O'Malley test was found to be the legal test of a prima facie case of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. According to Morris, it is a question of mixed fact and law whether the evidence adduced in any given case is sufficient to prove adverse differentiation on a prohibited ground, if believed and not satisfactorily explained by the respondent (Morris, par. 27).\n[105] The Tribunal shares the view expressed in Singh v. Canada (Statistics Canada), [1998] C.H.R.D., No. 7, at par. 197 that to support a finding that a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the complainant must do more than put forward sweeping assertions. Furthermore, as stated in Bobb, mere allegations that a conduct was racially motivated cannot be substituted for proof of facts (Bobb v. Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission), [2004] A.J. No. 117, par. 76. The Tribunal further shares the view that a tribunal should be reluctant to find discrimination on the basis of a prohibited ground where there is a reasonable alternative to the theory that the complainant incurred discrimination.\n[106] A belief, however strong, that someone is being discriminated against is not sufficient in law to give rise to an inference of discrimination or to establish a prima facie case of discrimination (Singh v. (Statistics Canada) [1998] C.H.R.D. No 7, par. 206). As stated in Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., [2005] CHRT 32, par.40, there must be some evidence, i.e. material facts, that if believed, will make the existence of discrimination more likely than its non-existence given all the circumstances of the case.\n[107] Finally, for there to be a prima facie case of discrimination, the mere allegation by the complainant that he was qualified or more qualified, that he was a member of a group that has historically been the target of discrimination, and that he did not get the job is insufficient to raise an inference of discrimination (Potocnik v.Thunder Bay (City), 1996 O.H.R.B.I.D. No 29, par. 13).\n[108] Over the years, Human Rights Tribunals have recognized that direct evidence that discrimination was the motivating factor behind a decision or a behavior is rarely available to complainants, given that discrimination is not a practice which is usually displayed overtly. As stated in Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company, [1988] C.H.R.D. No 2, rarely can discrimination be proven by direct evidence.\n[109] Complainants alleging discrimination must thus more often than not rely on circumstantial evidence, notably the conduct of individuals or organizations whose conduct is at issue (Brooks v. Canada (Department of Fisheries and Oceans), 2006 F.C.J. No. 1569, par. 27). The criteria is whether the circumstantial evidence, if believed, tends to prove the allegation of discrimination.\n[110] In Brooks, this Tribunal stated, with respect to circumstantial evidence, that it is not enough if circumstantial evidence is consistent with an inference of discrimination. This merely establishes the possibility of discrimination, which is not enough to prove the case. The evidence must be inconsistent with other possibilities. (Brooks, par., 114).\n[111] This said, as stated in Wall v. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, (1997) C.H.R.D. 6, the standard of proof in discrimination cases remains the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities and that in cases of circumstantial evidence, the test is the following: an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (B.Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Carwell, 1987, p. 142).\n[112] Hence, in its determination as to whether or not an alleged conduct is discriminatory, the Tribunal must analyze and scrutinize carefully the conduct itself as well as the context in which it occurred, keeping in mind, as stated in Marinaki v. Canada (Human Resources Development), [2000] C.H.R.D No 2, that for a complaint to succeed, it is not necessary that discriminatory consideration be the sole reason for the actions in issue but that it is sufficient that the discrimination be a basis for a person's action (Marinaki, par. 191) and that the intent to discriminate is irrelevant to the determination of discrimination (Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission) v. Play it Again Sports Ltd, [2004] N.S.J. No 403, par. 37).\n[113] As for the assessment of the likelihood of a person obtaining an acting position or a permanent position, Counsel for the Complainant referred the Tribunal to the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Attorney General) v. Morgan, [1992] 2 C.F. 401, more specifically to the opinion of Mr. Justice Marceau to argue that to establish that someone would have obtained a certain position, it is not required to prove that, without the discriminatory practice, the position would certainly have been obtained but that a mere possibility, provided it was a serious one, is sufficient to prove its reality (Morgan, p. 412).\n(ii) Retaliation [114] The Canadian Human Rights Act, as it stands, considers retaliation or threats of retaliation only in relation to a complaint having been filed and a conduct which was in response to the complaint being filed (Witwicky v. Canadian National Railway, [2007] C.H.R.D. No. 28). The source of the retaliation must thus be the filing of a complaint and not, for example, an event which occurred prior to the filing of the complaint. The law is clear. Section 14.1 of the Act only considers retaliation in relation to the filing of a complaint. Furthermore, as indicated by this Tribunal in Marinaki v. Canada (Human Resources Development, [2000] C.H.R.D. No 2, par. 224, section 14.1 of the Act came into force on June 30, 1998 with no retroactive effect being contemplated. To apply the new retaliation provision of the Act to acts occurring before the section came into force would be to attach new consequences to events that took place before the enactment. This would, according to the Tribunal, give the legislation retrospective effect, which is not generally permissible, and is not supported by the wording of the act.\n[115] The record indicates that Dr. Chopra's initial complaint is dated May, 13, 1998. To be considered thus as a retaliatory act under article 14.1 of the Act, the event contemplated by an allegation of retaliation must have occurred after June 30, 1998. It follows that the Tribunal cannot consider as retaliation actions or events that preceded June 30, 1998, namely Dr. Chopra's alleged exclusion from the Flumequine project in 1993, the Scott appointment in 1994, the Elanco incident in 1997, the appointment of Dr. Lachance in February of 1998. The only events to which section 14.1 of the Act can apply are the Zohair complaint in 1999, the appointment of Dr. Butler and Alexander in 1999 to acting positions and the suspension imposed on Dr. Chopra by Dr. Lachance in August 1999.\n(iii) Harassment [116] The Canadian Human Rights Act does not define what constitutes harassment but the case law does. In Hill v. Air Canada, 2003 CHRT 9, this Tribunal stated that the gravamen of harassment lies in the creation of a hostile work environment, which violates the personal dignity of the complainant. In Marinaki v. Canada (Human Resources Development), [2002] C.H.R.D. No 2, this Tribunal examined the elements that should be taken into consideration when determining if there has been harassment under section 14 of the Act.\n[117] In Marinaki, the Tribunal expressed the view that victims of harassment need not prove that they suffered pecuniary losses, that for a behaviour to amount to harassment, some element of repetition or persistence is usually required, although in some situations, a single, serious incident may be sufficient to constitute harassment (Marinaki, par. 188-191). As stated in Bobb v. Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission), [2004] A.J. No 117, in certain circumstances, a single incident may be enough to create a hostile work environment. In those circumstances, the nature of a conduct should be calculated according to the inversely proportional rule: the more serious the conduct and its consequences are, the less repetition is necessary; conversely, the less severe the conduct, the more persistence will have to be demonstrated.\nC. The relevant allegations [118] Given the Tribunal's ruling with respect to the Drennan complaint, the Liston comments and the Gunner incident, these matters do not form part of the issues to be adjucated by this Tribunal with respect to the present complaint.\n[119] The issues that need to be addressed in the context of the present complaint are three fold: firstly, the Tribunal will consider issues related to different appointment opportunities, namely the Scott appointment in relation to the corrective measures ordered to be put in place (1995), the appointment of Dr. Lanchance to the position of Director, BVD (1997), the self-appointment of Dr. Paterson to the position of Director, BVD (1998) and the appointments of Dr. Alexander and Butler as acting Chiefs (1999). Secondly, the Tribunal will consider events that were identified by the Complainant as potentially discriminatory or retaliatory, namely the comments made by Dr. Lachance at a BVD meeting (1998), the suspension imposed on Dr. Chopra by Dr. Lachance (1999), the Zohair complaint (1999) and the Elanco complaint (1997). Thirdly, the Tribunal will consider the allegation of systemic discrimination made by the Complainant.\n[120] As previously stated, the Complainant alleges in his complaint forms, as well as in the particulars attached to one of the complaint forms and his additional allegations, that he was discriminated and retaliated against by Health Canada, that he was harassed and defamed by Health Canada. The Tribunal will assess these allegations in relation to the following issues: discrimination, retaliation and harassment.\n[121] In his Statement of particulars, Counsel for the Complainant states that, although Dr. Chopra's complaint is based on evidence of discrimination in a number of particular incidents, all of these incidents must be viewed in context and as part of a pattern which is the result of systemic racial discrimination. Accordingly, it is imperative that the incidents described in the complaint be considered as a group and in relation to each other, so that proper connections can be drawn and conclusions made regarding the impact of systemic discrimination in the workplace.\n[122] In his final submissions, Counsel for the Respondent argued that for many of the allegations of discrimination made by Dr. Chopra, there is no evidenciary foundation for a finding of discrimination but only bare allegations of discrimination and racism and nothing more and nothing from which the Tribunal can draw an inference of discrimination. For Counsel for the Respondent, the allegations made by Dr. Chopra are not credible, none have been corroborated by anyone else. For Respondent's Counsel, credibility is the decisive factor in this case. Furthermore, in his view, allegations not made in a timely manner should be looked at suspiciously.\n[123] In his oral submissions, Counsel for the Complainant urged the Tribunal to review the background to this case and that part of the background are the prior Tribunal decisions in NCARR and Chopra (Hadjis decision) and that these decisions provide the context in which this complaint rests. For Complainant's Counsel, this Tribunal cannot ignore the findings made by these Tribunals and the context in which they were made given that they are contemporaneous to some of the events related to this complaint and would have affected Dr. Chopra's career opportunities.\n[124] In this respect, Counsel for the Complainant argued that it will be extremely helpful for the Tribunal to know that the Department was found to have engaged in discriminatory acts in a period immediately preceeding or contemporeaneous to the events that the Tribunal is concerned about. Counsel for the Complainant further argued that if discrimination happened in 1991, given the history of the Department, discrimination will also have happened after that year.\n[125] The record shows that in the Hadjis decision, the Tribunal found that the candidate who obtained the position of Director, Human Prescription Drugs in 1991 was not qualified, that Dr. Chopra had been discriminated against with respect to this position and that, had Dr. Chopra assumed the duties of Director, Human Prescription Drugs at that time, he would have acquired the recent management experience required to be screened into the competition (Hadjis decision, par. 266).\n[126] In the NCARR decision, the Tribunal made a series of findings, notably:\nThere is a significant under-representation of visible minorities in senior management in HC. The failure of visible minorities to progress into management cannot be explained by a lack of interest or lack of technical professional skills on the part of these visible minorities. A common theme in the evidence is that visible minorities in HC lack the necessary managerial experience to move into senior management positions. The necessary managerial experience can be obtained through acting positions, and through exercising supervisory responsibilities and through management training programs. Acting positions constituted a very large part of the total staffing action in HC during the period 1991 to 1995. Acting appointments were often made without a competition and on an informal basis. As a result, potentially qualified persons are not considered for appointment or when an acting appointment is challenged, the subsequent selection process is affected by an unintended bias so that the person initially appointed is usually confirmed in the position. Visible minorities proportionately were given less acting positions than non-visible minorities. Visible minorities were at a disadvantage with respect to how they found out about acting positions. Non-visible minorities were more often asked by their managers to apply whereas visible minorities were required to be more proactive in finding out about opportunities for acting positions. Visible minorities received less management related training than non-visible minorities. Non-visible minorities were more often informed of management training opportunities by their managers whereas visible minorities had to be much more self-reliant in finding out about these opportunities. There is a minority disadvantage in terms of supervising other employees. Management training and having held an acting appointment increased the likelihood of supervisory responsibility for both non-visible minorities and visible minorities. But in the case of non-visible minorities with management training or non-visible minorities who held acting positions, there was a significant increase in the likelihood of being supervisors as compared to visible minorities. Visible minorities are viewed by senior management as culturally different within HC and are not considered suitable for managerial positions.\n[127] The Tribunal concluded in the NCARR case that Health Canada had engaged in certain staffing practices, contrary to section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, ordered Health Canada to adopt and implement a special corrective measures program, some measures being of a permanent nature, others of a temporary nature.\n(i) Issues related to different appointment opportunities [128] In his complaint forms, dated May 13, 1998 and January 12, 1999, as well as in his additional allegations dated June 27, 1999, the Complainant alleges that throughout his career at Health Canada he had been denied career opportunities. He cites a series of examples in support of his general allegation that he was denied career opportunities, that none of his white co-workers have been treated in a similar manner and that the reasons he has been treated in an adverse differential manner is due to his race, colour and national or ethnic origin.\n[129] The Complainant further alleges that Health Canada consistently bypassed well-qualified visible minority candidates for management positions, that the general practice of the department is to recruit EX's from within Health Canada, unless there are qualified visible minority candidates interested in these positions, at which time the department recruits externally.\n[130] The Tribunal will hence analyse the different appointment opportunities that the Complainant might have been denied in the period extending from 1993 to 1999 in as much as these apppointment opportunities have not been ruled upon by other Tribunals.\na) The Scott appointment (1995) [131] In the particulars to his amended complaint form, Dr. Chopra states that there are at least two recent examples where he was denied career opportunities. The Complainant goes on to say that the first occurred in 1997 (corrected to 1993), when he met Dr. Gunner, Director General of the Food Directorate at the time, who asked him what could be done to make the situation equitable for him. Dr. Chopra responded that he would like to be considered for the position of Director, Bureau Veterinary Drugs (BVD) which was vacant. Dr. Chopra then applied for the position but was screened out. When he appealed this staffing action, his appeal was dismissed and he was told that he was not successful because he lacked management and media experience as well as international experience.\n[132] The Complainant alleges in his particulars that none of this is true, that he had management experience prior to working for Health Canada and since joining the department most recently as the Acting Chief, Central Nervous System, Anti-Parasitic and Endocrine Division for a four month period in 1996. In terms of media experience, the Complainant asserts that he has extensive experience through his community work in dealing with racism and through his complaints. As to the international experience, the Complainant states that he is a fellow of the World Health Organization.\n[133] The Complainant goes on to state that the successful candidate for the position of Director, BVD, was Dr. Tim Scott, that Dr. Scott is Caucasian and is from Agriculture Canada. The Complainant alleges that soon after being appointed to the position, it became evident that he lacked both the skills and the expertise for the position. The Complainant further alleges that Dr. Scott went at one point on special assignment to the Director General of the Food Directorate, Dr. George Paterson, and that the latter made himself the Acting Director, while also remaining as the Director General and maintaining Dr. Scott on special assignment to him. The Complainant then expresses the belief that this was done to prevent him from applying for the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs.\n[134] Finally, in his complaint, the Complainant refers to the fact that the Chief position of the Central Nervous Systems, Anti-Parasitic and Endocrine Division, was eliminated in February of 1997 with an amalgamation and expresses the belief that the Chief position was abolished to prevent him and other visible minority members of the BVD from applying for it through an open competition.\n[135] As stated above, the Tribunal will only look at the events that occurred after the decision was made to order corrective measures following Dr. Casorso's successful appeal and will not revisit issues dealt with and decided upon by the Hadjis Tribunal.\n[136] The Complainant is of the view that the deficiencies that the Department was required to correct should have resulted in him being reconsidered for the position, in addition to Dr. Casorso, given that the decision of the Public Service Commission Appeal Board benefits every candidate and that the fact that the Complainant was not contacted by the Department should be considered retaliation.\n[137] According to Counsel for the Complainant, Dr. Chopra ought to have been given the opportunity to participate in the new competition, that had he been given the opportunity to have the benefit of the corrective measures, he would have been screened into the competition and should have been appointed to the position in issue after the corrective measures.\n[138] The evidence shows that Dr. Breton, as Dr. Chopra and Dr. Casorso, were screened out from the first competition because they did not have the management experience nor did they have experience as a departmental representative with the media, two essential conditions in order to be screened into the competition. The record also indicates that Dr. Chopra and Dr. Casorso appealled the decision and that Dr. Chopra's appeal was dismissed but Dr. Casorso's appeal was allowed.\n[139] The evidence also indicates that, after the successful appeal of Dr. Casorso, Dr. Scott was notified of the corrective measures to address the Appeal Board findings. The evidence shows that Dr. Chopra was not contacted after Dr. Casorso's successful appeal. In fact, the evidence indicates that, except for Dr. Carsorso, none of the canditates that had been screened out the first time were contacted. Dr. Breton, who is not a visible minority, testified that he himself was not contacted after Dr. Casorso's successful appeal.\n[140] In his oral submissions, Counsel for the Respondent argued that there were no reason to contact Dr. Breton or Dr. Chopra. Dr. Chopra was complaining before the Appeal Board of bias. The record shows that before the Appeal Board, Dr. Chopra stated he had extensive experience dealing with the media in the private sector. The Appeal Board noted that the experience required for the position was experience as a departmental representative with outside agencies. The Board rejected the contention that Dr. Chopra's experience with the media as a private citizen was the same as experience as a departmental representative with the media. In the case of Dr. Chopra, recent and significant experience in the past 5 and 10 years does not appear to have been a determining factor.\n[141] The record indicates that one of the corrective measures was that the temporal criteria which required that experience in managing a scientific or medical or veterinary organization with multi-faceted programs, be recent within the past ten years and significant at least five years were to be eliminated.\n[142] Asked if with the elimination of the criteria, the ten year and five year requirements, he thought he would have met that experience requirement, i.e. in managing a scientific or medical or veterinary organization with multi-faceted programs, Dr. Chopra stated that he should have been given an opportunity, like Dr. Casorso to meet with the Board and explain how he would meet the qualification for which he was screened out, that he had prior experience, management training, working experience of training managers to be better managers in scientific and medical organization. In his testimony, Dr. Chopra further highlighted the fact that recent experience was not necessary because he had done the job, because he had gotten training and had the knowledge requirement, that he met the media requirement and had a very sensitive way of dealing with situations.\n[143] It must be noted here that, in his 2001 ruling, Mr. Hadjis found that Dr. Chopra was not the victim of adverse differential treatment with respect to the Scott competition for the position of Director, Bureau of Veterinary Drugs. Mr. Hadjis found, in this respect, that although he was screened out for lack of recent management experience, Dr. Chopra was also deemed to lack the second qualification of experience in dealing with outside organizations and that no evidence was adduced to indicate that he did in fact possess the latter qualification nor that his lacking this experience was related to discrimination by the Respondent. Mr. Hadjis concluded that he was satisfied that Dr. Chopra was not qualified for the position (Hadjis decision, par. 288). In his testimony, Dr. Chopra stated that he did not agree personally with the findings of Mr. Hadjis with respect to his media experience.\n[144] The Tribunal finds that, even if Dr. Chopra had been contacted after Dr. Carsorso's successful appeal, he would have still been lacking one of the essential conditions required in relation to the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, given Mr. Hadjis's finding.\n[145] The Tribunal thus finds that the Complainant has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to this aspect of the Scott's appointment. The mere fact that Dr. Chopra was not contacted is insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The Tribunal finds that, even if the Complainant is right in saying that he should have been contacted after the corrective measures, there is no proven material facts that give credence to the allegation that the reason the Complainant was not contacted was because of his ethnic origin. The evidence shows that Dr. Breton, who is not a visible minority, was also not contacted after the corrective measures.\n[146] Furthermore, the Tribunal finds that the fact that Dr. Chopra was not contacted after the successful appeal of Dr. Casorso cannot be considered retaliation on the part of Health Canada. As stated earlier, section 14.1 of the Act only took effect on June 30, 1998 and had no retroactive effect.\n[147] Finally, the Tribunal finds that no evidence was lead with respect to the elimination of the Chief position CNS and its alleged purpose, i.e. to prevent the Complainant and other visible minority members of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs from applying for the position through an open competition. Hence, the Tribunal will not consider this issue.\nb) The Self-appointment of Dr. Paterson to the position of Director, BVD (1997) [148] The evidence shows that, as of November 12, 1996, Dr. Scott was replaced by Dr. Landry, Chief of the Pharmaceutical Assessment Division, as Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs on an acting basis. The record shows that Dr. Yong had acted for four months in that position before Dr. Landry.\n[149] Dr. Chopra, who had completed a four month acting assignment as Chief CNS, in February 1997, testified that he was not given the opportunity to act in this position afterwards, Dr. Paterson, the Director General, appointing himself, according to Dr. Chopra, acting director of the Bureau. According to Dr. Chopra, Dr. Paterson cumulated the two positions, that of Director General and Acting Director, BVD, until Dr. Lachance was appointed Director in February 1998. Dr. Chopra testified that there was no competition held in order to fill the position of Director.\n[150] Drs. Paterson and Lachance were not called as witnesses. This said, the issue is, in the context of the present complaint, whether or not the actions taken by the Department were discriminatory, more specifically, whether or not the decision not to fill the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs or to give acting appointments to other individuals, including evaluators from the Bureau, was discriminatory.\n[151] It must be noted here that both Drs. Yong and Landry had been screened out of the competition for the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs in 1993 in relation to the Scott competition as was Dr. Chopra but were nevertheless asked to act as Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs for a limited period of time. One striking difference is that both Drs. Yong and Landry were chiefs which was not the case for Dr. Chopra and had more managerial experience than Dr. Chopra who had just completed a four month acting assignement.\n[152] Furthermore, given that if Dr. Chopra had become acting Director, he would have become the boss of his boss, Dr. Yong, a situation which from a purely managerial point of view, could have been problematic given that, once the acting assignment completed, Dr. Chopra would have gone back to his position of drug evaluator in the Human Safety Division.\n[153] The Tribunal is of the view that the normal course of action is to appoint the person immediately below, here Drs. Yong and Landry, who were Chiefs and had several years of experience as a chief. The evidence shows that none of Dr. Chopra's colleagues, i.e. other evaluators, were asked to fill the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs on an acting basis. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent Counsel's statement that there is nothing wrong or unusual per se in management deciding to eliminate a layer of management for a period of time.\n[154] This said, the Tribunal does not have to determine with respect to the legitimacy of Dr. Paterson cumulating two positions at the same time whether or not Health Canada was in compliance with the NCARR Order, as ruled previously by member Groarke. Furthermore, the evidence shows that at the time of the self-appointment of Dr. Paterson to the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, Health Canada was being monitored for its compliance with the NCARR Order by the Commission. The evidence shows that the Commission found Health Canada to be in compliance. No evidence was tendered to suggest otherwise.\n[155] The Tribunal thus finds that, given the circumstances, the decision of the Department not to ask any of the evaluator in the Human Safety Divison and the Pharmaceutical Assessment Divison, the only two divisions that existed at the time in the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, to act as Director of the Bureau appears to have been reasonable and cannot be considered discriminatory.\n[156] Hence, the Tribunal finds that the Complainant has not made with respect to the issue of the self-appointment of Dr. Paterson as Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs for a period of time in 1997 a prima facie case of discrimination.\nc) The Lachance appointment (1998) [157] In the particulars attached to his amended complaint form, the Complainant states that a second example of him being denied career opportunities occurred on February 9, 1998 when Dr. Paterson announced that Dr. Andr\u00e9 Lachance would be deployed to fill the Director position as Dr. Scott had retired, that Dr. Lachance was also from Agriculture Canada and lacked the required training and experience in the relevant fields of veterinary science and drug regulatory work of the Bureau. The Complainant goes on to say that the National Capital Alliance on Race Relations (NCARR) had opposed his appointment as being in violation of the Tribunal ruling in the NCARR complaint.\n[158] With respect to Dr. Lachance's appointment, the Complainant filed additional allegations on June 27, 1999. In these additional allegations, the Complainant states that he maintains that Dr. Lachance, who is Caucasian, did not have the prerequisite education, such as a degree in veterinary science, to assume the position, that he raised an objection with the Director General, George Paterson, about this appointment. The Complainant goes on to state that, in response to his objection to the appointment, the Director General denied that this expertise was required.\n[159] In the the particulars to his amended complaint form, the Complainant refers to the fact that there was a petition circulating concerning Dr. Lachance's culturally insensitive remark that he likes visible minorities when he was formally presented to the employees of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs on February 9, 1998. The Complainant asserts in his particulars that, once again, that he and other visible minority candidates have been prevented from applying for a position for which they were well qualified, in favour of less qualified white candidates who have obtained the position without going through a competitive process.\n[160] Drs. Paterson, Scott and Lachance were not called as witnesses. With respect to Dr. Lachance, there was a debate about him being called as a witness. The record shows that, at first, Counsel for the Respondent, wanted to file a medical report that would have established Dr. Lachance's inability to testify given his medical condition. The Tribunal never got to see the report. Counsel for the Complainant objected to the filing of the report and required that the physician having written the report be required to testify so as to be cross-examined by Complainant's Counsel. In the end, neither Dr. Lachance nor his physician were called as witness. In his final submissions, Counsel for the Complainant asked that the Tribunal make an adverse inference with respect to the fact that the Respondent did not call Dr. Lachance as a witness and declined to call his physician.\n[161] The evidence shows that, in relation to Dr. Lachance's appointment, a petition was sent to the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada. The evidence indicates that the petitioners considered the appointment of Dr. Lachance to be one of many appointments and promotions where the merit principle had been circumvented. The petitioners were complaining about the fact that Dr. Lachance was coming from Agriculture Canada to replace Dr. Scott without competition while Dr. Scott had been appointed through a competition.\n[162] In his testimony, the Complainant stated that, after the appointment of Dr. Lachance, he raised some concerns about his appointment. These dealt firstly with Dr. Lachance's qualifications and secondly with the comments he made at a meeting after his appointment. Dr. Chopra further stated that he complained to Dr. Paterson about the racially insensitive corporate culture which, despite the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal's decision in NCARR continued to prevail among the senior management of the Department. Dr. Chopra testified that Dr. Parterson did not talk to him about whether or not the appointment of Dr. Lachance was consistent or inconsistent with the NCARR Tribunal Order. Dr. Chopra expressed the view that Dr. Paterson was part of the problem at Health Canada.\n[163] In his testimony, the Complainant reiterated his belief that Dr. Lachance lacked the required training and experience in the relevant fields of veterinary science and drug regulatory work of the Bureau. The Complainant also expressed the belief that he and other visible minority candidates had been prevented from applying for a position for which they were well qualified in favour of less qualified white candidates who had obtained the position without going through a competitive process.\n[164] Dr. Chopra testified that he was never contacted to see if he was interested in the Director's position, on an acting basis, prior to the appointment being made and expressed the view that he should have been considered.\n[165] Dr. Chopra was asked, in relation to the Statement of Qualifications for the Director position, if he met the qualifications for the period 1996-1998. Dr. Chopra testified that he met the educational qualifications, as well as the experience qualifications. Having had recent management experience as the Acting Chief, for four months, of the CNS Division, from October 1996 to February 1997, he considered himself as fulfiling all qualifications with respect to experience.\n[166] Dr. Chopra further stated that he also met the knowledge qualifications as well as all the training qualifications. He stated that nobody had formal training of the kind he had, referring to the Senior Management Development Program, SMDP. With respect to knowledge of management techniques, Dr. Chopra referred to his experiences outside the Department and indicated that he had full knowledge of evaluating and monitoring drug residues, thorough knowledge of existing programs and activities in 1996 to 1998 as well as the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations. Dr. Chopra further stated that he had enormous experience and the ability to manage both human and financial resources, in every capacity, that he met all the other features related to the abilities required for the position as well as the personal qualities.\n[167] For Complainant's Counsel, this case would have been an ideal situation to promote visible minorities, to implement the principles of Employment Equity and to give a visible minority experience as a manager as opposed to swapping two other employees. For him, human rights supersede any other consideration.\n[168] On the issue of Dr. Lachance's appointment to the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, the Tribunal heard the testimony of Ms. Gail Mclean. Ms. Mclean was at the time Director of Executive Services at Health Canada.\n[169] Ms. Mclean testified that Dr. Scott, an EX-2, wanted to retire but that he did not want to be financially penalized, given that he did not have the age or the years of service. Ms. Mclean testified that, at the time, there existed a program, the Alternate Exchange Program, where a person could switch job or position with someone who was about to lose his job and someone who wanted to retire. The evidence shows that, at Agriculture Canada, Dr. Lachance's position had been declared surplus. Ms. McLean testified that when the decision was made to swap Dr. Lachance and Dr. Scott, the Department did not look at the impact on visible minorities. Ms. Mclean further testified that Dr. Lachance was found to meet the requirements for the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs.\n[170] Ms. Mclean explained that in order to be eligible for a SWAP, both candidates had to be at the same managerial level. The evidence shows that Dr. Lachance was an EX-2 at Agriculture Canada. Ms. Mclean testified that the Department had to consider a SWAP prior to initiating any staffing activity of any other kind, whether it be a deployment or a competitive process. She testified that, at the time, there was no vacancy for the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs. Ms. Mclean further testified that the decision to have a SWAP had nothing to do with Dr. Chopra, that it was initiated by Dr. Scott. The Tribunal finds her evidence to be credible. Even if Dr. Paterson was not called as a witness, the evidence shows that Ms. Mclean was directly and immediately involved in the SWAP process between Drs. Landry and Scott.\n[171] The evidence shows that the SWAP became effective on March 31, 1998 after Dr. Scott had left Health Canada and Dr. Lachance had accepted the offer to become Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs.\n[172] The Tribunal finds that, given the SWAP procedure that was used to appoint Dr. Lachance, given the testimony of Ms. Mclean as to the reasons for using this procedure, i.e. Dr. Scott desire to retire, given her testimony that the decision to have a SWAP was in no way related to Dr. Chopra, the Complainant has not made a prima facie case of discrimination. The context and circumstances surrounding Dr. Scott's departure from Health Canada and the arrival of Dr. Lachance do not reflect any discriminatory animus on the part of Health Canada.\n[173] The Tribunal hence finds that the fact that the Department did not offer Dr. Chopra the opportunity to compete for the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs was not discriminatory, that the decision was made to truly accommodate Dr. Scott.\nd) The Alexander appointment (1999) [174] In his additional allegations dated June 26, 1999, the Complainant states that a meeting on June 2, 1999 with Ms. Kerrie Strachan, Human Resources Officer for the Branch (and former Human Rights Coordinator), it was announced that the Department would proceed with a four month appointment which carried no rights to appeal. The Complainant adds that Ms. Strachan announced that at the end of the four months, the position would be open and a competitive process including an exam and a Board would be held and that when she was questioned about the Tribunal Order in NCARR and its contravention, Ms. Strachan refused to discuss the issue and the meeting terminated.\n[175] The Complainant goes on to state that he believes that this appointment, as well as the previous opportunities denied him in 1997 and 1998 are overtly discriminatory and in direct contravention of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Order in NCARR which required Health Canada to develop practices to remove systemic barriers to the advancement of visible minority employees and remedy past discrimination. For the Complainant, it is clear that he was not considered for the positions, that the Department would not rescind Dr. Alexander's appointment and that the Department had taken actions which constitute retaliation against him because of having filed his human rights complaint, in that he was qualified for these positions and had been bypassed because of the harassment complaint he had filed.\n[176] In his additional allegations, dated June 26, 1999, the Complainant reiterates that in May, 1999, Dr. Lachance appointed Dr. Ian Alexander as Acting Chief of the Human Safety Division, for a period of four months. The Complainant further expresses the belief that Dr. Alexander, who is Caucasian, did not have the experience and educational background required for this position.\n[177] The evidence shows that, on May 6, 1999, an announcement was made, at an all staff meeting, that Dr. Yong, the Chief of the Human Safety Division, would be on assignment for a year and that as of May, 5, 1999, Dr. Ian Alexander would be the Acting Chief of the Human Safety Division for a period of four months. The evidence shows that within the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, Dr. Alexander was an evaluator in the Pharmaceutical Assessment Division, working under the authority of Dr. Landry whereas Dr. Chopra was an evaluator in the Human Safety Division, working under the authority of Dr. Yong. The evidence also shows that before being offered to Dr. Alexander, the acting position was offered to a visible minority i.e. Dr. Sharma, an evaluator in the Pharmaceutical Assessment Division but that the latter refused the acting assignment.\n[178] The evidence shows that, with respect to the position of Chief of the Human Safety Division, Health Canada initially considered the possibility of filling this position with an employee on a Career Assignement Program (CAP), that the only qualified and available applicant was not interested in this as a CAP assignment, that a decision was made to conduct an internal competitive process for an acting appointment of approximately one year, as well as to have someone act in the position for a short period while the competitive process was conducted and that in light of some proposed changes to the organization, it had been decided that prior to posting this acting assignment, a review of the classification of the position would be conducted.\n[179] In his testimony, Dr. Chopra asserted that there was no notice posted for the Acting position of Chief, that he was not made aware of the proposal to conduct a competititon for the acting appointment, that he was not invited to apply and was not considered. Dr. Chopra stated that he learned ex post facto of the appointment of Dr. Alexander. Dr. Chopra further testified that Dr. Alexander had not worked in the Human Safety Division, that he did not have the required qualifications for the positions and had no experience in it and that he was appointed without competition by a decision of Dr. Lachance. Dr. Chopra moreover stated in his testimony that he was the most qualified person for the job, that he had recently obtained line management experience having acted as Chief, for four months, in one of the Animal Safety Divisions. Dr. Chopra further added that the position was directly in his immediate area of work, that he was the expert in that area, that he had international experience, having a WHO fellowship.\n[180] Dr. Chopra stated in his testimony that he would have been interested in acting for the Chief of Human Safety position in 1999. He further stated that he found it odd that in a memo written by K. Strachan, from Human Resources, on April 30, 2003, many years after the appointment of Dr. Alexander as acting chief of the Human Safety Division, the latter would state, with respect to the question as to why people were chosen to act as Chief of the Human Safety Division in May 1999, that Dr. Lachance was trying at the time to ensure that staff who were asked to act in the position were not intending on competing for the position when it was to be staffed permanently, so the permanent staffing would be fair. According to Dr. Chopra, you give the acting appointments and then quite frequently, 93 percent of the time, people who are acting get the job.\n[181] The evidence shows that Dr. Chopra objected to the appointment of Dr. Alexander, found it to be discriminatory and in direct contravention of the NCARR Tribunal Order. A letter to this effect, dated May 31, 1999, signed by Dr. Chopra and two other evaluators, was sent to the Chief Commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In the letter, Dr. Chopra and his colleagues ask that the appointment of Dr. Alexander be rescinded and that visible minority members of the Human Safety Division be offered the same appointment.\n[182] At the hearing, Counsel for the Respondent disputed the assertion made by Dr. Chopra that Health Canada was in contravention of the NCARR Tribunal Order and referred to the ruling previously made by member Groarke where the latter ruled that any question of compliance must be dealt with in the Federal Court. For his part, Counsel for the Complainant stated that it was not his intention to put in issue whether there was compliance or not with the NCARR Order.\n[183] The record shows that in a letter dated June 8, 1999, the Chief Commissioner's Office replied that the Tribunal Order in the NCARR decision required that Health Canada develop programs and practices to remove systemic barriers that have prevented the advancement of visible minority employees and implement initiatives to remedy past discrimination and that the overall goal of the Order was to ensure that visible minority representation at Health Canada reached appropriate levels. The letter goes on to say that the Tribunal Order does not preclude the promotion of non-visible minority candidates. The letter further states that the purpose of the Commission's monitoring function under the Tribunal Order is to assess whether Health Canada is making reasonable progress toward compliance with the Permanent and Temporary Measures outlined in the Tribunal Order and that to date, the Commission's analysis have indicated that overall, such progress is being achieve.\n[184] The Tribunal, given the letter sent by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to Dr. Chopra where it is clearly stated that Health Canada by appointing Dr. Alexander as acting Chief of the Human Safety Division was not contravening the Tribunal Order in NCARR, takes note of the fact that Health Canada did not contravene the NCARR Order when it appointed Dr. Alexander as Acting Chief of the Human Safety Division.\n[185] Furthermore, the Tribunal finds that the Complainant has failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to the appointment of Dr. Alexander as acting Chief of the Human Safety Division in May 1999. The record shows that Dr. Alexander had the experience and educational background required for this position. Dr. Chopra might have perceived that he had been discriminated against but mere perceptions are not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination\n[186] This said, the Tribunal finds worth nothing that Dr. Chopra stated in a document that Dr. Alexander was brought in to harass people in the division. This view clearly shows that, from the beginning, Dr. Chopra was ill-disposed towards Dr. Alexander. It reflects poorly on Dr. Chopra's credibility with respect to any allegation of discrimination in relation to the appointment of Dr. Alexander.\n[187] As for Dr. Chopra's claim that the appointment was retaliatory, the Tribunal finds that Dr. Chopra was not clear as to what constituted retaliation with respect to the Alexander appointment. The Tribunal finds that the Complainant has not established that the appointment of Dr. Alexander in May 1999 as acting Chief of the Human Safety Division constitutes retaliation on the part of Health Canada for the filing of a human rights complaint by Dr. Chopra.\ne) The Butler appointment (1999) [188] The evidence shows that, in July 1999, Dr. Kelly Butler, Chief of the National Biorepository Centre at Health Canada, was offered a deployment to the position of Chief of the newly created Policy and Program Division. According to the evidence, a deployment is the move of an employee from one position to another with the same occupational group. The evidence shows that Dr. Chopra and other of his colleagues grieved the deployment of Dr. Butler before the Public Service Commission of Canada and that their grievance was upheld, the deployment investigator concluding on November 9, 2000 that the deployment of Dr. Butler was made in contravention of the Public Service Employment Act.\n[189] The evidence also shows that, as of September 20, 1999 for a period of four months, up until January 17, 2000, while remaining Chief of the newly created Policy and Program Division, Dr. Butler became the Acting Chief of the Human Safety Division, an appointment made by Dr. Lachance. Dr. Butler replaced Dr. Alexander in the acting position. The evidence further shows that Dr. Butler was reappointed acting Chief of the Human Safety Division from January 17, 2000 to May 16, 2000, pending the classification of that position initiated in December 1999 and that she would be acting as Director of Bureau of Veterinary Drugs during the absence of Dr. Lachance, from January of 2000 to February of 2000.\n[190] Asked why it was necessary to fill the position held by Dr. Alexander again on September 20, 1999, Dr. Chopra stated that it was because the acting term for Dr. Alexander had expired so either his term would have to be extended or someone else would have to be appointed. Dr. Chopra further stated in his testimony that Dr. Butler was from outside the Bureau, that she had never worked in the Bureau, that she had no idea or knowledge of the Human Safety Division's work and that she was an unqualified person in his opinion. Asked if he had acted in the position of Chief of Human Safety at any time, Dr. Chopra testified that he had acted in 1988 for six weeks or so, before Dr. Yong was appointed, and afterwards, off an on whenever he was asked to, up to about 1992.\n[191] Asked what he thought about Dr. Butler's appointment, Dr. Chopra stated that he would disagree with her appointment because he was the most senior scientist in the Human Safety Division, but that he was never asked to act, that it was always someone from outside the division and white, first Dr. Alexander, then Dr. Butler, both, according to Dr. Chopra, unqualified to be in that division.\n[192] According to Dr. Chopra, Dr. Butler was not bilingual while the position required for the person to be bilingual. Asked if, in his view, he would have been qualified to act in the Chief of Human Safety Division position, Dr. Chopra answered that if he was qualified back in 1988 and off and on appointed, then he certainly would have been qualified, even from Health Canada's point of view.\n[193] Dr. Chopra testified that he was the most qualified candidate, had all the scientific qualifications, the interpersonal skills, the negotiating skills, according to his appraisals, that he was courteous and bilingual, had international experience, had been a fellow of the WHO, had management training, given by the Public Service Commission, had worked as a trainer of managers in Health Canada for three years. Dr. Chopra further noted that Dr. Lachance who had made racist remarks was appointing white people into the very job that was in his immediate neighbourhood and capacity.\n[194] In relation to both the Alexander and Kelly appointments made by Dr. Lachance, Counsel for the Complainant argued that both times Dr. Chopra was denied an opportunity to act in a management position. Counsel for the Complainant also argued that it was troubling that the department would deny Dr. Chopra an opportunity to act by giving that position to Dr. Butler, when she already had another job if not two other jobs and was new to the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs. For him, the question that begs an answer is: why would you not give the acting position to Dr. Chopra in those circumstances. For Complainant's Counsel, the conduct of Health Canada management raises issues and questions about the credibility of the Department and the discrimination isssue.\n[195] Counsel for the Complainant asserts that there was a position available to Dr. Chopra, that Dr. Chopra was qualified for it, that others were placed into the position repeatedly and that race was a motivating factor. Moreover, for Counsel for the Complainant, the Department did not come up with a valid explanation with respect to why Dr. Chopra was not provided with certain opportunities to act. Counsel for the Complainant furthermore asserts that all of this adds up to discrimination and underscores the fact that the findings made by the NCARR and the Hadjis Tribunals clearly established the fact that Health Canada was an organization where racial discrimination existed at the time of the events covered by this complaint.\n[196] Counsel for the Respondent, for his part, argued that even if the evidence is to the effect that Dr. Chopra was not invited to apply to the acting position and that a competition was not held, that does not mean that discrimination occurred. Just as Dr. Chopra was not invited to apply for the acting position, nor were any of his colleagues from the Human Safety Division invited to apply or, in fact, anyone else regardless of whether they were visible minorities or not. Everyone was thus treated the same.\n[197] Counsel for the Respondent further argued that Health Canada was not obliged to offer Dr. Chopra any acting position which came up and that the failure to offer him the position regardless of whether he was qualified or not does not mean that a prima facie case of discrimination has occurred. For whatever reason, he stated, Health Canada did not offer the position on an acting basis to any of the people in the Human Safety Division, and a prima facie case is not proven on this basis.\n[198] The issue here is not whether or not Dr. Chopra should or would have become Chief of the Human Safety Division within the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs but whether or not he was denied an acting position because of his race or ethnic origin. Hence, it does not matter whether or not the two individuals who acted as Chief of the Human Safety Division in 1998 obtained or not the position later on. The issue is: was Dr. Chopra who for years had shown interest in accessing managerial positions and who had acted in the past as Chief of the Human Safety Division (1988) as well as Chief of the Central Nervous System, Endocrine and Antiparasitic Drugs Division (1996-1997) not offered the acting position because of his ethnic origin.\n[199] The appointment of Dr. Butler as acting Chief of the Human Safety Division raises a number of questions. Dr. Butler was appointed Chief of a newly created division, the Policy and Program Division, in July 1999. Dr. Butler came from outside of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs which is not in and of itself unusual, the record shows. This said, it would have taken her some time to adapt to her new tasks and run the division efficiently.\n[200] Now, the record indicates that as early as September 1999, Dr. Butler was asked to act as Chief of the Human Safety Division for a period of four months while being Chief of the Policy and Program Division. Furthermore, the record shows that in January 2000, she was asked again to act as Chief of the Human Safety Division while remaining Chief of the Policy and Program Division and, in addition, was to act at the same time as the Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs in the absence of Dr. Lachance.\n[201] The Tribunal finds it odd that a person new to the Bureau would be entrusted with so many tasks at the same time. Dr. Butler was not call as a witness, nor was Dr. Lachance to provide the Tribunal with an explanation as to why she was considered to be the only person who could fill the temporary vacancies in the position of Chief of the Human Safety Division. Given that Dr. Lachance was the person making these appointments and given that Dr. Lachance was not called as a witness, the Tribunal is left without an explanation as to the logic and the basis of these different acting appointments given to one person, new to the Bureau, except for the reason provided four years after the fact by Mr. Strachan in a memo dated April 30, 2003. As mentioned earlier, in her memo, Ms. Strachan who was not called as a witness, states with respect to the question as to why people were chosen to act as Chief of the Human Safety Division in May 1999, that Dr. Lachance was trying at the time to ensure that staff who were asked to act in the position were not intending on competing for the position when it was to be staffed permanently, so the permanent staffing would be fair. The Tribunal finds it odd that such an explanation would come up four years after the fact and frankly finds the explanation hard to believe.\n[202] This said, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that Dr. Lachance was the person making the acting appointments and that he was at odds with Dr. Chopra over many issues. In addition, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that Dr. Chopra had shown in a recent past that he wanted to acquire managerial experience, that he had acted as Chief of the Human Safety Division in 1988 for a period of six weeks, that he had acted as Chief of the CNS Division for a period of four months at the end of 1996 and in early 1997 and thus had recent managerial experience. Moreover, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that Dr. Lachance had made comments with racist overtones at a meeting of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs in February 1998. Finally, the Tribunal cannot also ignore the fact that Health Canada had been found to have, in the past, discriminated against Dr. Chopra and that it had also been the object of a Tribunal Order in NCARR, the Tribunal having found that visible minorities were being discriminated against in relation to their access to managerial positions. These are all circumstances that the Tribunal cannot ignore in determining if the Complainant has made a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[203] As stated earlier, a prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd. (O'Malley), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 or, in other words, one where the evidence, if believed, and not satisfactorily explained by the respondent, will suffice for the complainant to succeed.\n[204] As stated in Basi v. Canadian National Railways Company, [1988] C.H.R.D. No 2, the inference of discrimination that must be drawn from the circumstantial evidence in order to support the complainant's case must be consistent with the allegation of discrimination and inconsistent with any other rational explanation. In cases such this one, as stated in Basi, much depends on the ability of a Tribunal to draw inferences, (which are reasonable if not in fact compelling) from the conduct of the employer. Once these inferences are raised, the employer has an onus of explaining what his motives were, other than what they appeared to be.\n[205] The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that Dr. Chopra's credibility with respect to the allegations of discrimination he has made are an issue in the present case. This said, the Tribunal must nevertheless assess if these allegations are well founded in light of the whole of the evidence, including the circumstancial evidence.\n[206] The Tribunal finds that Dr. Chopra has made a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to the appointment of Dr. Butler as Chief of the Human Safety Division in September 1999. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that Dr. Butler was reappointed Chief of the Human Safety Division in January 2000. The Tribunal will however make no findings with respect to this reappointment given that it falls outside the scope of this complaint.\n[207] The probative elements and circumstancial evidence establishing a prima case of discrimination relate to the fact that Dr. Chopra had indicated that he wanted to have managerial experience, that he had twice in the past acted as Chief, that he had recent managerial experience, that he had been in the past the victim of discrimination at Health Canada because of his ethnic origin, that at the time of the event, Health Canada had recently been found by the NCARR Tribunal to have discriminated against visible minorities, that Dr. Lachance had in the past made comments of a racist nature or at least which had a racial overtone, as found by this Tribunal, that Dr. Chopra and Dr. Lachance were at odds with respect to issues of discrimination and finally, the fact that the reason provided in Ms. Strachan's memo to justify the conduct of Dr. Lachance is hard to believe. The Tribunal is of the view that these elements considered together are sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The Tribunal finds that there is here a subtle scent of discrimination.\n[208] Given these findings, the Respondent had the burden of providing a reasonable explanation which would not be a mere pretext that would lead a Tribunal to believe that discrimination had no part to play in the decision to appoint Dr. Butler in September 1999 as acting Chief of the Human Safety Division. The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to provide such an explanation.\n[209] Dr. Lachance was not called as a witness, nor was Dr. Butler. It is insufficient for Counsel for the Respondent to state that Health Canada can appoint whomsoever it wants to a position. It may well be that the decision not to appoint Dr. Chopra had nothing to do with discrimination and Dr. Chopra's ethnic background, such as the fact that Dr. Chopra did not get along with his colleagues or that he was not available. Counsel for the Respondent states that no other person from the Human Safety Division was offered the position. This in and of itself is not conclusive evidence that no discrimination was involved in the selection process. It could be that some individuals were invited to apply and turned down the invitation. Who knows? Who can say? The Respondent did not provide the Tribunal with any concrete evidence but limited itself to invoking different possibilities.\n[210] Hence, the Tribunal finds that Dr. Chopra was discriminated against contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act when he was not invited to act as Chief of the Human Safety Division in September 1999.\n[211] This finding does not however resolve the following issue: had Dr. Chopra been appointed acting Chief of the Human Safety Division in September 1999 would he have become later on Chief of that division.\n[212] In his final submissions, Counsel for the Complainant relied on the Morgan decision as well as the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Chopra v. (Canada) A.G., [2007] FCA 268 to support his argument that the proper test to apply when considering whether or not Dr. Chopra would have been appointed in the future to a Chief or Director position, is the following: there must be a connection or causal link between the position which was not obtained and the discrimination (Morgan, p. 432).\n[213] With respect to this issue, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that in 2000, Dr. Chopra failed the 810 In-Basket test run with respect to the position of Chief of the Human Safety Division. The record shows that Dr. Chopra challenged the test as being discrimatory but was not successful. Thus, Dr. Chopra was not able to compete for the permanent position of Chief of the Human Safety Division.\n[214] Hence, the Tribunal cannot establish a causal link between the fact that Dr. Chopra was discriminated against with respect to the position of Acting Chief of the Human Safety Division and the fact that he did not obtain the permanent position of Chief of the Human Safety Division in 2000.\n(ii) Issues related to incidents potentially discriminatory [215] In his complaint, the Complainant raises a number of events which he alleges were discriminatory. These are the Lachance comments made at a Bureau of Veterinary Drugs staff meeting, the five-day suspension he received from Dr. Lachance in relation to the Heritage Canada Conference, the Zohair complaint, the Elanco complaint and the Flumequine project. The Tribunal will deal with each of these events in turn so as to determine if they constitute discrimination, retaliation or harassment against Dr. Chopra.\na) The Lachance comments [216] In the particulars to his complaint, the Complainant mentions that there is a petition circulating concerning Dr. Lachance's culturally insensitive remark that he likes visible minorities when he was formally presented to the employees of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs on February 9, 1998. In his additional allegations dated June 27, 1999, the Complainant adds that he raised the issue of Dr. Lachance's comments with Dr. Paterson, the Director General, and that the latter downplayed the seriousness of the comments which he claims offended him and some colleagues from the Bureau.\n[217] The evidence shows that on February 9, 1998, Dr. Lachance who had just been appointed Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, was introduced to the staff of the Bureau by the Director General, Dr. Paterson, as the future Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs in replacement of Dr. Scott.\n[218] According to Dr. Chopra's testimony, in the course of introducing himself, Dr. Lachance would have stated, looking at his audience, that he liked visible minorities. Dr. Chopra stated in his testimony that he found the remark upsetting, given the previous Tribunal's decision in NCARR. Dr. Chopra expressed the view that this was a racist remark.\n[219] The record shows that, on February 10, 1998, Dr. Chopra sent a memorandum to Dr. Paterson in which he indicates that the statement made by Dr. Lachance was a deeply insensitive racial remark towards visible minority employees of the Bureau. Dr. Chopra further states in his memorandum that here lies a typical example of the racially insensitive corporate culture, which despite the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision in NCARR continues to prevail among the senior management of this department. Dr. Chopra ends his letter by requesting that the appointment of Dr. Lachance be reconsidered.\n[220] Furthermore, the record shows that, in his response to Dr. Chopra's memorandum, Dr. Paterson expressed some doubt about the accuracy of the statement allegedly made by Dr. Lachance and tried to put it in the proper context, i.e. Dr. Lachance wanted to establish a good relation with his new staff. Dr. Paterson furthermore underscored the fact that Dr. Chopra's concerns regarding Dr. Lachance's comments were not shared by all of the staff of the Bureau. Indeed, the evidence shows that two persons attending the meeting dissociated themselves from the views expressed by Dr. Chopra.\n[221] Dr. Chopra testified that he did not find Dr. Paterson's response a proper one. Furthermore, Dr. Chopra indicated that he felt that Dr. Paterson was taking side with Dr. Lachance and felt very frustrated about the handling of the whole matter, that this showed that there was still a culture of racism in Health Canada.\n[222] In a memorandum sent to Dr. Paterson by Dr. Lachance, the latter explained, after having reviewed the memorandum sent by Dr. Chopra to Dr. Lachance, that his purpose in attending the meeting was to strike immediately a good relationship with a majority of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs staff, that in his previous job, he had a large mix of visible minorities among the staff and that the context of the February 9, 1998 meeting led him to tell them that the audience looked like his former group of employees which had a good mix of visible minorities and that he personally enjoyed this. Finally, Dr. Lachance writes that, contrary to Dr. Chopra's insensitive statement made on February 10, 1998 about his motivation that afternoon, his remarks demonstrated a high degree of cultural sensitivity to the visible minorities in the Bureau.\n[223] In the course of the hearing, the Tribunal heard evidence from Ms. Tang, a human resource advisor in the Executive Services Unit at Health Canada, about the training Dr. Lachance received in relation to diversity in the workplace after the February 9, 1998 meeting. Ms. Tang testified that Dr. Lachance first attended a workshop on December 8, 1998 on Bias-Free Competency Selection as well as another training course on December 9, 1998 entitled Building Diverse Workteams. The evidence shows that Mr. Tang had no knowledge of the content or substance of these courses and was unable to confirm whether Dr. Lachance had in fact attended either of the courses for which he was enrolled.\n[224] The records shows that the Lachance matter ended up before the Standing Senate Committee on Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders where Mr. David Dodge, then Deputy Minister at Health Canada, appeared as a witness and was questioned about the Lachance comments. The record shows that Mr. David Dodge, who was not called as a witness in these proceedings, stated before the Senate Committee, on February 29, 2000, in relation to the statement made by Dr. Lachance that he liked visible minorities or a visible minority person mentality permeates all these things, that Dr. Lachance had been informed that, whatever his motives, those were inappropriate statements. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt that the transcripts of the Senate Committee meeting in relation to the testimony of Mr. Dodge are not accurate.\n[225] Given that Mr. Dodge and Dr. Paterson were not called as witnesses, the Tribunal is left with its own interpretation of the views they expressed with respect to the comments made by Dr. Lachance at the February 9, 1999 meeting. Given that Dr. Lachance was not called as a witness, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent could have called Dr. Paterson to explain how the Department had dealt with the statement made by Dr. Lachance over and above the documents tendered in evidence. The same can be said about Mr. Dodge.\n[226] In his oral submisions, Counsel for the Complainant argued that the comments made by Dr. Lachance at the February 9, 1998 meeting were more than unwise or inappropriate; they were blatantly racist and offensive and that it does not matter if some people did not take offence. For Complainant's Counsel, they are not only discriminatory; they constitue harassment.\n[227] For his part, Counsel for the Respondent argued that the Tribunal cannot infer from Dr. Lachance's comments that he was a racist and hence, that all of his future actions in relation to his position of Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs should be seen as discriminatory or motivated by racism. For Respondent's Counsel, the comments were taken out of context by Dr. Chopra. As to whether or not Dr. Lachance's comments constitute harassment, Counsel for the Respondent argued that what was said does not meet the criteria of what constitute harassment under the law. A single remark does not meet the threshold of harassment.\n[228] The Tribunal finds that the comments made by Dr. Lachance at the February 6, 1998 meeting to have been offensive to Dr. Chopra and, by any standard, racist, even if some people in attendance did not find it to be so. Even though the comments might have been made to break the ice so to speak with his new colleagues, or seen as an attempt to be friendly with the group, it nevertheless shows a lack of sensitivity on the part of Dr. Lachance for people whose skin is not white who are seen to be different from white individuals. Dr. Lachance might not have had the intention to discriminate against visible minorities. Nevertheless, the case law is clear: the intent of a person is irrelevant to the issue of determining whether or not someone has discriminated against someone else (Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission) v. Play it Again Sports Ltd, [2004] N.S.J. No. 403, par. 36).\n[229] The Tribunal thus finds that Dr. Chopra not only has made a prima facie case of discrimination in relation to Dr. Lachance's comment made at the Ferbruary 9, 1998 meeting but has adduced conclusive evidence that Dr. Lachance discriminated against him on the basis of his race or ethnic origin contrary to section 7 of the Act. As stated above, the intent to discriminate or not is irrelevant to the proof of discrimination. The test is, over and above the racial nature of the comment itself, whether or not the person alleging discrimination was offended by the comment (Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission) v. Play it Again Sports Ltd, [2004] N.S.J. No. 403).\n[230] The elements that the Tribunal finds to be conclusive in relation to the prima facie test are the past history of discrimination at Health Canada, the inherent racist nature of the comment - white v. non-white, the fact that Dr. Chopra was offended by the comment and made it known to the Director General, the lack of sensitivity expressed by both Dr. Lachance and Dr. Paterson to Dr. Chopra's concerns and the fact that Dr. Lachance received, after the February 1998 meeting, training in relation diversity in the workplace. The Respondent had thus the onus of proving that Dr. Lachance's comments were in no way discriminatory. The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to do so.\n[231] The Tribunal finds in this respect that the exchange of correspondence between Dr. Paterson and Dr. Lachance as well as between Dr. Paterson and Dr. Chopra shows more an attempt to justify what was said rather than acknowledge that the comments might have been offensive and discriminatory. Dr. Lachance and Dr. Paterson were not called as witnesses and were thus not able to provide the Tribunal with more insight in the comments that were made at the February 9, 1998 meeting. The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to provide a credibible explanation of the true nature of the comments made by Dr. Lachance and does not find their written explanations conclusive in the absence of their testimony.\n[232] Here again, the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that the credibility of Dr. Chopra is at issue. This said, the evidence clearly shows that the day after the comments were made, Dr. Chopra made it known to the Director General that he had been offended by the comments. The Tribunal finds no reason to think that Dr. Chopra's concerns with respect to the comments made by Dr. Lachance were not genuine and that they were motivated by the desire to retaliate against Dr. Lachance.\n[233] The Tribunal finds however that, given the context in which Dr. Lachance's comments were made, the comments although inappropriate and racist do not constitute harassment in that they do not meet the Marinaki and Bobbs criteria. The Tribunal is of the view that the comments made at the February 9, 1998 meeting constitute an isolated incident. There is here no persistence or repetition and we are not looking at a pattern of behavior. The Tribunal notes that no evidence was tendered showing that Dr. Lachance repeated these comments in another forum.\n[234] This said, the Tribunal is of the opinion that, given the past history of discrimination and racial insensitivity at Health Canada, the NCARR decision notably and its findings, the Department should have acted more robustly and should have made it publicly known that it did not approve of Dr. Lachance's conduct, that it would not stand for comments of this nature in the Department.\n[235] The Tribunal finds that Dr. Paterson was fairly dismissive with respect to Dr. Chopra's complaint. His first response was to shed doubt about Dr. Chopra's recollection of the event rather than take it seriously and ask that it be investigated further. Dr. Paterson should have seen in Dr. Chopra's memorandum cause for concern given the NCARR decision. The Tribunal is of the view that the Lachance matter should not have escalated the way it did and that if it had been managed properly, it would have led to an apology on the part of Dr. Lachance or at least a statement to the effect that if he had offended anyone by his remarks, he regretted it and apologized. It appears that no apology was made.\nb) The five-day suspension [236] Counsel for the Complainant argued that the five-day suspension imposed on Dr. Chopra by Dr. Lachance was in retaliation of Dr. Chopra speaking out about the existence of racist practices in the public service, especially at Health Canada, as well as discriminatory.\n[237] For his part, Counsel for the Respondent argued that at the time the five-day suspension was imposed on him, Dr. Chopra did not characterize it as discriminatory but as retaliatory. In his view, there is no element of discrimination or retaliation in the decision to suspend Dr. Chopra. Counsel for the Respondent conceded however that Health Canada was wrong in its characterization of Dr. Chopra's action as a breach of his duty of loyalty to his employer in light of the decision rendered by the Public Service Staff Relations Board on March 12, 2001.\n[238] The Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that the individual who suspended Dr. Chopra was Dr. Lachance, that the suspension came after Dr. Chopra had signed a petition which challenged Dr. Lachance's appointment as Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs in February 1998 and after Dr. Chopra had complained to the Director General in writing about the comments made by Dr. Lachance at his first meeting with the staff of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs on February 9, 1998 as well as after Dr. Chopra had filed on June 27, 1999 additional allegations to his original complaint which specifically refer to Dr. Lachance discriminatory conduct.\n[239] The Tribunal cannot also ignore the fact that, following the comments that Dr. Landry made at the February 9, 1998 meeting, the latter, in a memorandum sent to Dr. Paterson, responded tit for tat to the allegation made by Dr. Chopra in his February 10, 1998 memorandum to Dr. Paterson. In his memorandum to Dr. Paterson, Dr. Chopra refers to the fact that Dr. Lachance had made an insensitive remark in relation to visible minorities. The evidence shows that in his own memorandum to Dr. Paterson, Dr. Lachance refers to Dr. Chopra's insensitive statement made on February 10, 1998 about his motivation that afternoon. The Tribunal sees Dr. Lachance's response as a clear indication that he was ready to confront Dr. Chopra and that the stage was set for future confrontations.\n[240] The Tribunal finds that these different elements in addition to the fact that Dr. Lachance could have dealt with the situation differently, as mentioned by Counsel for the Complainant, and appeared to be convinced that there was no discrimination going on at Health Canada, are sufficient to establish a prima facie case of retaliation but insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Furthermore, the Tribunal considers that Dr. Lachance must have been aware of the existence of Dr. Chopra's complaint and additional allegations made against him in June 1999.\n[241] The Tribunal is mindful though of the fact that, in his letter dated August 11, 1999, Dr. Lachance writes in relation to the Heritage Canada conference that he considers Dr. Chopra as being in breach of his duty of loyalty to the Department and his conduct as willful misconduct totally unacceptable to the Department and hence has decided to suspend Dr. Chopra for a period of 5 working days.\n[242] The record shows that the Respondent elected not to call Dr. Lachance as a witness. As seen previously, beyond the discussions that took place between the parties and the information they provided to the Tribunal, the Tribunal was never formally apprised of the reasons for which Dr. Lachance was not called. Should the Tribunal hence rely conclusively on the letter addressed by Dr. Lachance to Dr. Chopra on August 11, 1999 to infer that the sole reason which lead Dr. Lachance to impose on Dr. Chopra a five-day suspension was Dr. Chopra's willfull misconduct and conclude, given the context in which the decision was made, that retaliation had nothing to do with his decision without hearing Dr. Lachance or someone from Health Canada?\n[243] As one knows, discrimination as well as retaliation will often times not be overt. It is often times through the direct examination of a witness that the truth comes to light. In this respect, it is worth citing Sopinka et al., The Law of Evidence in Canada, 1999, at par. 6.321 where the authors write: In the same vein, an adverse inference may be drawn against a party who does not call a material witness over whom he or she has exclusive control and does not explain it away. Such failure amounts to an implied admission that the evidence of the absent witness would be contrary to the party's case, or at least would not support it.\n[244] The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed, by not calling the proper witness or witnesses, to prove that retaliation was not an element that motivated Dr. Lachance in imposing on Dr. Chopra a five-day suspension, given the circumstances surrounding the imposition of the suspension. Hence, the Tribunal finds that, given the context, retaliation was, on a balance of probabilities, a factor that lead Dr. Lachance to impose on Dr. Chopra a the five-day suspension on August 11, 1999 in contravention of section 14.1 of the Act.\nc) The Zohair complaint [245] [1] In his submissions to the Tribunal, Counsel for the Complainant asserted that the way Health Canada dealt with the Zohair complaint as well as the Heritage Canada conference incident are examples of harassment on the part of Health Canada in relation to Dr. Chopra. Counsel for the Complainant underscored the fact that while Health Canada was prepared to take swift actions against the Complainant, it acted less swiftly with other Health Canda employees whose conduct, in the eyes of Dr. Chopra, was reprehensible.\n[246] The Tribunal fails to see in the way Health Canada handled the Zohair complaint evidence of harassment on the part of Health Canada. The Tribunal finds that the Complainant has failed to prove that this event meets the legal criteria required to establish harassment under section 10 of the Act. Furthermore, the Tribunal fails to see how Health Canada's handling of the Zohair complaint can constitute retaliation on the part of Health Canada for Dr. Chopra having filed a human rights complaint. The evidence on this point is squarely non existent.\nd) The Elanco complaint [247] The Tribunal finds that there is no material fact that was tendered in evidence by Dr. Chopra establishing that the Department's conduct in relation to the Elanco complaint was discriminatory and was motivated by Dr. Chopra's ethnic origin. The Tribunal finds thus that the Complainant has failed here to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in relation to the Elanco complaint. Mere allegations of discrimination without any evidentiary foundation do not give rise to a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[248] This said, given that the Elanco incident occurred in 1997, before the coming into force of section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the actions or inaction of Health Canada in relation to the Elanco incident cannot be considered as retaliation under the Act.\ne) The exclusion from the Flumequine project [249] The Complainant testified that his exclusion from the Flumequine project in 1993 was not direct discrimination but retaliation for having raised human rights issues within the Bureau.\n[250] Given that the Flumequine project took place in 1993 well before the coming into force of section 14.1 of the Act, the Tribunal finds that the Complainant has not met the legal requirement for the Tribunal to make a finding of retaliation for a complaint filed by the Complainant.\n(iii) The issue of systemic discrimination [251] In his complaint form dated January 12, 1999, the Complainant alleges that none of his white co-workers have been treated in a similar manner as he has and that the reason he has been treated in an adverse differential manner is due to his race, colour and national or ethic origin. The Complainant further alleges that Health Canada consistently bypasses well-qualified visible minority candidates for management positions and that the general practice of the Department is to recruit EX's from within Health Canada, unless there are qualified visible minority candidates interested in these positions, at which time the Department recruits externally.\n[252] In his Statement of particulars, the Complainant further alleges that his persistent lack of promotion at Health Canada is due, in part, to systemic racial discrimination against visible minority personnel by the senior management of Health Canada and goes on to mention the senior managers who, he believes, practice systemic racial discrimination.\n[253] The Complainant further alleges in his Statement of particulars that the Department has failed to provide him with necessary training or other opportunities to upgrade his abilities and qualifications. In his way, he alleges, Health Canada consistently bypasses visible minority candidates for management positions. Finally, the Complainant states that these practices constitute and are demonstrative of systemic discrimination at Health Canada, contrary to section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[254] The allegations made by the Complainant with respect to the existence of systemic discrimination at Health Canada during the period of 1993 to 1999 are wide and far reaching. As stated earlier, he who alleges must prove and it is not sufficient to make broad allegations of discrimination without proving them or hold strong beliefs that discrimination is rampant at Health Canada.\n[255] Systemic discrimination in an employment context was defined in Action Travail des Femmes v. CNR, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114, at pages 1139 and 1143 as discrimination that results from the simple operation of established procedures of recruitment, hiring and promotion, none of which is necessarily designed to promote discrimination. Systemic discrimination is often unintentional. It results from the application of established practices and policies that, in effect, have a negative impact upon hiring and advancement prospects of a particular group. It is compounded by the attitudes of managers and co-workes who accept stereotyped visions which lead to the firmly held conviction that members of that group are incapable of doing a particular job, even when that conclusion is objectively false. The Court furthermore stated that to combat systemic discrimination, it is essential to create a climate in which both negative practice and negative attitudes can be challenged and discouraged.\n[256] The Tribunal is cognizant of the fact that, in the past, Health Canada has been found to be decifient in the appointment of visible minorities to management positions. The findings of the Tribunal in NCARR and its decision clearly establish that Health Canada did not meet the requirements of the Canadian Human Rights Act with respect to employment opportunities for visible minorities.\n[257] Furthermore, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that, in the past, Dr. Chopra has had many bad experiences with the Department: a complaint made against him without him being informed of its existence (Drennan), a memo being written about him without him being informed of its content (Cuddihy), his exclusions from projects in which colleagues were asked to participate without him being provided with any explanation (Flumequine project), the five-day suspension imposed on him by Dr. Lachance (Heritage Canada Conference), the reprimand he received from Dr. Le Magueur (Zohair complaint). In addition, the record shows that Dr. Chopra has witnessed many acting opportunities and positions escaping him: the Scott appointment (1993-95), the Lachance appointment (1998), the Alexander appointment (1999), the Butler appointment (1999), all tainted according to him by discrimination. All of these events have had their toll on Dr. Chopra who has come to see discrimination being rampant at Health Canada. Are all of these events affecting one person sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude that there was at Health Canada in the period of time covered by the complaint (1993-1999) a form of systemic discrimination that affected the whole organisation.\n[258] The record shows that, in September 2002, the five-year period for the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Order in NCARR was completed and that in a letter dated May 13, 2003, the Canadian Human Rights Commission found Health Canada to be in full compliance with all measures outlined in the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Order. More specifically, the Commission states, in its letter to the Deputy Minister, Health Canada, that the analysis made by the Commission shows that during the five-year period the representation of members of visible minorities at Health Canada has increased substantially in categories and levels relevant to the Tribunal Order. The letter goes on to state that such significant progress could not have been achieved without the commitment of Health Canada's senior management. The letter further states that data on recruitment into EX Senior Management level and into feeder groups into this level show that members of visible minorities received equitable shares of these appointments and that the data show that members of visible minorities received shares of acting position in the levels set out in the Tribunal Order that were in line with expectations. In her letter, the Chief Commissioner acknowledges that Health Canada is now in full compliance with all measures included in the Tribunal Order.\n[259] This Tribunal cannot ignore these facts and findings. It must be noted here that the period covered by the Tribunal Order in NCARR extends from 1997 to 2002 and covers some of the allegations of discrimination made by the Complainant.\n[260] In his testimony, the Complainant disputed the fact that Health Canada was in full compliance with all the measures included in the Tribunal Order related to the NCARR decision. As stated earlier, the Complainant is entitled to his opinions. This said, allegations as strong as they may be that would contradict established and undisputed facts and findings need to be proven.\n[261] The Tribunal finds that the Complainant has not, on a balance of probabilities, proven that systemic discrimination was not properly addressed by Health Canada after the Tribunal Order in NCARR and still prevailed at Health Canada during the period of time extending from 1997 to 2002.\n[262] Given the lack of evidence adduced by the Complainant to contradict the Commission's findings, there is no reason for the Tribunal to conclude that systemic discrimination still exists at Health Canada and to order it to take additional measures to address general or systemic issues of discrimination.\n[263] This said, it does not follow that discrimination did not exist or could not have existed in a recent past within Health Canada and that individuals within the Department, at times, as this file shows, could not have acted in a discriminatory way. Past occurrences of discrimination may justifiably raise concerns about the continued existence of discrimination in the workplace. However, they do not in themselves prove that systemic discrimination exists. A finding or a few findings of discrimination are not sufficient per se to establish systemic discrimination in an organisation such as Health Canada.\n[264] Furthermore, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that the Complainant's allegations that every manager at Health Canada practices systemic racial discrimination against visible minority personnel and that every appointment within the Department over the past 20 years has been discriminatory remains unsubstantiated assertions until material facts are brought to the attention of the Tribunal. Sweeping assertions such as those made by the Complainant without a proper evidenciary basis, in the end, undermine his credibility as to whether or not Health Canada has complied with the NCARR Tribunal Order and have an negative impact on the promotion of human rights.\n[265] The Tribunal thus finds that the Complainant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that Health Canada contravened section 10 of the Act.\nIV. REMEDIES [266] The Tribunal finds that the complaint filed by Dr. Chopra is substantiated in three aspects:\nthe comments made by Dr. Lachance on February 9, 1998 were discriminatory against Dr. Chopra as well as individuals working at the time in the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs who were non-white and were in contravention of section 7(b) of the Act; the five-day suspension imposed on August 11, 1999 to Dr. Chopra by Dr. Lachance was the result of some form of retaliation against Dr. Chopra for having file a human rights complaint and was in contravention of section 14.1 of the Act; Dr. Chopra was discriminated against when he was not offered an acting position in September 1999 with respect to the position of Chief of the Human Safety Division in contravention of section 7(b) of the Act.\n[267] The Complainant asked in this oral submission that Dr. Chopra be compensated for hurt feelings related to the discrimination and retaliation he might have been the victim of. Given the conclusions reached by the Tribunal with respect to the events which the Tribunal found to be discriminatory and retaliatory, the Tribunal is of the view that an amount of 4 000$ for hurt feelings is reasonable. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that two of the three events which the Tribunal found to be discriminatory or retaliatory occurred after June 30, 1998 when the ceiling for pain and suffering was increased to $20 000.\n[268] In his final submissions, Counsel for the Complainant asked that the Complainant be compensated for any lost wages related to a discriminatory act. Given that the Tribunal has found that Dr. Chopra was discriminated against with respect to the acting position of Chief of the Human Safety Division in 1999, Dr. Chopra is entitled to be compensated for the difference between what he would have earned as acting Chief compared to what he would have earned at the time as an evaluator.\n[269] The parties indicated to the Tribunal that they would determine amongst themselves any amount related to lost wages. The Tribunal will however retain jurisdiction on the damage amount for lost wages in case the parties cannot agree.\nV. ORDER [270] For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal declares that the Complainant's rights under the Canadian Human Rights Act, more specifically sections 7 and 14.1 of the Act, have been contravened by the Respondent and orders that:\nthe Complainant be paid the sum of $4,000 for hurt feelings; the Complainant be awarded for lost wages an amount equivalent to the difference between what he would have been paid had he acted as Chief of the Human Safety Division for a four month period in September 1999 and what he would have earned as an evaluator; that the interest on the above amount be paid in accordance with Rule 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nSeptember 12, 2008\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT901\/2104\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nShiv Chopra v.

Hadjis\n2008 CHRT 4 2008\/02\/13\n[1] In a judgment dated October 16, 2007, the Federal Court set aside my decision in the present case and referred it back to the Tribunal for redetermination (Attorney General of Canada v. Buffett, 2007 FC 1061). The Court's Order stated that there is no need for the Tribunal to conduct an additional hearing and that Mr. Buffett's complaint is to be redetermined in accordance with the reasons of the Court, in particular, paragraphs 55 and 56 and following.\n[2] It was pointed out in the judgment that if the matter had consisted of an appeal of the Tribunal's decision rather than a judicial review, the Court would have ordered the Canadian Forces (CF) to fund the intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) portion of Mr. Buffett's treatment to a maximum of three cycles. The Court noted, however, that during the judicial review hearing, Mr. Buffett stated that given his and his spouse's current ages, it is no longer recommended that they seek in vitro fertilization (IVF) and ICSI treatments. Consequently, the Court concluded that the issuance of such an order has now been rendered moot. Accordingly, the present decision does not contain such an order.\n[3] In addition, the parties have confirmed to the Tribunal that that the CF has paid in full the pain and suffering award resulting from my decision of September 15, 2006, which award was undisturbed by the Court in its judgment of October 16, 2007. I do not think it necessary, therefore, for me to re-issue this order.\n[4] Thus, for the reasons given by the Court, I hereby make the following order:\nPursuant to s. 53(2)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, I order the Canadian Forces to take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to amend its policy such that as long as the Canadian Forces continues to fund in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments for its female members, male members shall receive funding for the intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) portion of their infertility treatments.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] On August 11, 2004, Mr. Richard Warman, the Complainant, filed a complaint against Ms. Melissa Guille in which he alleges that, on July 21, 2002 and onward, the latter discriminated against persons or groups of persons on the basis of sexual orientation, religion, race, colour and national or ethnic origin, by repeatedly communicating messages through an Internet website that would likely expose gays and lesbians, Jews, and Muslims, First Nations, Blacks, Arabs, other non-whites, and Roma (aka Gypsies) to hatred and or contempt contrary to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Complaint provides, according to the Complainant, eight representative samples of discriminatory material posted on the Canadian Heritage Alliance (CHA) website. The Complainant concludes that, based on the foregoing examples, he believes that Melissa Guille has discriminated against persons or groups of persons on the basis of sexual orientation, religion, race, colour, and national or ethnic origin, by repeatedly communicating messages through an Internet website that would likely expose gays and lesbians, Jews, and Muslims, First Nations, Blacks, Arabs, other non-whites, and Roma (aka Gypsies) to hatred and or contempt contrary to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[3] On August 11, 2004, Mr. Richard Warman filed a separate complaint against the Canadian Heritage Alliance alleging that, on July 21, 2002 and onward, the Canadian Heritage Alliance discriminated against persons or groups of persons on the basis of sexual orientation, religion, race, colour and national or ethnic origin, by repeatedly communicating messages through an Internet website that would likely expose gays and lesbians, Jews, and Muslims, First Nations, Blacks, Arabs, other non-whites, and Roma (aka Gypsies) to hatred and or contempt contrary to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[4] Given the similarities of the two complaints, the Tribunal will deal with them together.\n[5] The Commission fully participated at the hearing into the complaint and was represented by legal counsel. The Complainant, who is a lawyer, represented himself. As for the Respondents, they were represented by two agents, duly recognized as such by the Tribunal. The Tribunal heard two witnesses: Mr. Warman and Ms. Guille.\nII. THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT [6] Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act which deals with hate messages provides that\nIt is a discriminatory practice for a person or a group of persons acting in concert to communicate telephonically or to cause to be so communicated, repeatedly, in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, any matter that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. For greater certainty, subsection (1) applies in respect of a matter that is communicated by means of a computer or a group of interconnected or related computers, including the Internet, or any similar means of communication, but does not apply in respect of a matter that is communicated in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a broadcasting undertaking. For the purposes of this section, no owner or operator of a telecommunication undertaking communicates or causes to be communicated any matter described in subsection (1) by reason only that the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking owned or operated by that person are used by other persons for the transmission of that matter.\n[7] Section 3 of the Act defines the prohibited grounds for discrimination. It reads as follows:\nFor all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted. Where the ground of discrimination is pregnancy or child-birth, the discrimination shall be deemed to be on the ground of sex.\nIII. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS [8] Before analysing the substantive issues that the present complaints raise, there are a number of preliminary issues that the Tribunal must consider. These are A. the additional examples of possible violations of section 13 of the Act tendered in evidence by the Complainant and the Commission, B. the credibiliy of Mr. Warman, C. the status of the Canadian Heritage Alliance, D. the involvement of Ms. Guille with respect to the Canadian Heritage Alliance website, E. the constitutional challenge, F. the security measures that had to be put in place at the hearing.\nA. The additional examples [9] In the course of his testimony, Mr. Warman referred to 37 postings which he downloaded from the Canadian Heritage Alliance website and which he alleges contrevene section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. These postings can be put into two categories: 1. articles written by different individuals which address different topics, 2. threads in which individuals expressed their views in relation to the views expressed by other individuals able to post on the CHA website.\n[10] At the hearing, the issue arose as to whether or not the Tribunal was limited to the eight representative examples listed in the two complaint forms or could also consider the 37 or so postings and articles found in Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C of the Commission's Book of documents. The Respondents objected to the documents found in Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C being considered by the Tribunal given that they were not mentioned in the complaint forms. The Tribunal ruled that the postings found in Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C were admissible, but took the Respondent's objection under advisement.\n[11] The record shows that, at the time of the filing of his complaints against Ms. Guille and the Canadian Heritage Alliance, Mr. Warman in his complaint forms specifically refered to 8 postings on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website which, according to him, showed a breach of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rigts Act.\n[12] The evidence shows that additional examples were adduced in evidence by the Complainant and the Commission later in the process. The record shows that the two complaint forms that were referred to the Tribunal were never amended so as to incorporated additional examples of possible breach of section 13 of the Canadian Humans Rights Act in them.\n[13] The Respondents argued that this is a breach of the principle of natural justice, that a respondent, whoever he may be and however serious the allegations that are made, should know off-hand, from the beginning, what is the case that he or she has to meet so as to be in a position to defend himself or herself adequately. The Tribunal agrees.\n[14] In Warman v. Kyburz, 2003 CHRT 18, the Tribunal had to decided if material filed with the Tribunal shortly before the hearing was to begin were admissible. The Commission asked to file the material, notwithstanding that the documents had not been disclosed to the Respondent in advance of the hearing. The Tribunal allowed the material to be filed at the hearing, reserving its decision as to what weight, if any, should be attributed to the documents. The Tribunal, after having stated that the complaint did allege that the discriminatory practice was ongoing, ruled that it did not need to resolve this issue and indicated that the additional documents added little to the complaint, in that they simply consisted of further examples of the type of messages already described.\n[15] In Warman v. Winnicki, 2006 CHRT 20, the Commission asked that the complaints that had been referred to the Tribunal be amended to include additional grounds of discrimination. The Tribunal granted the request and the complaint was amended to include the additonnal grounds and the new material, referred to as the post-referral evidence, was appended to the revised complaint. The Tribunal stated in its decision that, as a result of the Tribunal's ruling, excerpts of the post-referral evidence were incorporated into the particulars of the amended complaint. The Tribunal further indicated that the amended complaint specifically contemplated the possibility that additional evidence of the violation of section 13(1) would occur by including the words `and ongoing' in the date of the alleged discriminatory conduct. It must be noted here that the respondent did not object when the Commission introduced the post-referral evidence, which is not the case in the present proceedings.\n[16] In Warman v. Kouba, 2006 CHRT 50, however, material that post-dated the filing of the complaint was submitted as evidence of the on-going violation of section 13 of the Act as alleged in the complaint form without any motion to have the complaint amended being brought. The Tribunal found it appropriate for it to consider the evidence that post-dated the filing of the complaint. The Tribunal based its decision on the fact that the respondent did not object to the production of the post-complaint material, that the evidence related to the ongoing nature of the alleged violations of the Act, and the fact that the respondent had notice through the complaint form and the disclosure of the material that additional material would be presented during the hearing.\n[17] In an earlier decision, Leblanc v. Canada Post Corporation, (1992) 18 C.H.R.R.D\/57, the Commission lead evidence of incidents of alleged discrimination which were not set out in the complaint form. The Tribunal heard the evidence. In its decision, the Tribunal stated that it would have been preferable if the Commission had provided the respondent with particulars of every incident of discrimination being relied upon in the complaint form. However, it went on to say that in an administrative hearing such as this one, the Commission and the complainant are not necessarily restricted to the four corners of the complaint form. The Tribunal further stated that the new evidence should be considered in light of the fairness of admitting it and concluded that, in that case, the respondent knew the case it had to meet.\n[18] Complaints brought pursuant to section 13 of the Act are not ordinary discrimination complaints in that the Act provides, since 1998, that a respondent can be ordered to pay a penalty of up to ten thousand dollars. The addition of a penal element to the Canadian Human Rights Act is not, as one can see, without consequence for a respondent.\n[19] The Tribunal is of view that, in any human rights complaint, a respondent is entitled to be provided with all the material elements upon which the Complainant and the Commission intend to rely on to prove a breach of the Act. The material elements should not only be part to the disclosure but of the complaint itself so that the respondent will know precisely the case he or she has to meet and be in a position to fully defend himself or herself.\n[20] The fact that the complaint forms indicate with respect to the date of the alledged conduct `ongoing' does not imply that the Commission or the Complainant can, at their leisure, add additional events or documents to the complaint without respecting the rules of natural justice and of procedural fairness.\n[21] The Tribunal is of the view that, if additional material is considered by the Commission or the complainant to potentially be in breach of section 13 of the Act, they can, as the case law shows, ask that the complaint be amended so as to introduce additional elements of potential discriminatory acts. To say that the respondent was not taken by surprise by the filing of additional documents does not meet the procedural fairness principle of a hearing and the right of a respondent to present a full defence to any allegation of improper conduct made against him under section 13 of the Act.\n[22] Furthermore, it is important to note that if a respondent is made aware that specific postings or articles are problematic and possibly in breach of section 13 of the Act, he or she will have the possibility of removing them, thus reducing the exposure of targeted groups to hatred and contempt.\n[23] In the present case, the record shows that the Complainant expressed the belief in his complaint forms that, based on the foregoing examples, which amounted to eight, Ms. Guille was in breach of Section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. If this is the case, then the addition of new material would only provide further examples of potential discriminatory acts. Basically, the eight examples provided in the complaint forms would still be in themselves sufficient to make the Commission's and the Complainant's case against the Respondents.\n[24] The Tribunal is cognizant of the fact that Section 48.9 of the Canadian Human Rights Act states that proceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expediously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedures allow. However, the Tribunal is of the view that the principles of nature justice and of procedural fairness trump expediency of the process and require that respondents be fully apprised, from the start and throughout the proceedings, what will be the case they will have to meet.\n[25] The evidence shows, as will be seen, that Ms. Guille, upon learning that some postings or articles were problematic, decided to remove them from the Canadian Heritage Alliance website as soon as she learned of their existence. One can surmise that had she known earlier, i.e. at the time of the filing of the complaint, she would probably have removed them earlier from the website, thus diminishing the exposure of the general public to material that is contrary to section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[26] The Tribunal thus finds that Respondents' objection with respect to the filing of additional material by the Commission without having amended the complaint forms to be well founded. Hence, the Tribunal will not make findings with respect to the additional material listed in Annex 1.\nB. The credibility of Mr. Warman [27] In the present proceedings, the Respondents attacked Mr. Warman's credibility on many fronts.\n[28] Firstly, the Respondents argued that Mr. Warman is a human rights activist who specializes in making complaints based on article 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act and who formerly worked for the Commission. Secondly, the Respondents argued that Mr. Warman was not truthful about his identity using the pseudonym David Mclean in his dealings with Ms. Guille and the Canadian Heritage Alliance. Thirdly, the Respondents stated that Mr. Warman was himself in breach of section 13 of the Act, for having created accounts on racist websites using the name Lucie Aubrack and the90sareover and posted material, using pseudonyms such as axetogrind, that could be considered hateful. Fourthly, the Respondents argued that Mr. Warman was evasive in his answers.\n[29] The record shows that Mr. Warman has, over the years, litigated many complaints referred to the Tribunal by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that Mr. Warman is a human rights activist and that this may colour at times his testimony. This said, the Tribunal when making its determination as to whether or not there was a breach of section 13 of the Act and as to whether or not the material tendered in evidence constitutes hate messages will have to take into consideration not only the testimonial evidence of Mr. Warman but also the documentary evidence tendered.\n[30] Furthermore, the Tribunal is of the view that the fact that Mr. Warman used a pseudonym, i.e. David Mclean, in his communications with Ms. Guille and the Canadian Heritage Alliance should not come as a surprise. This is common practice when going on the web. Generally speaking, people will not reveal their true identity.\n[31] With respect to the fact that Mr. Warman might have posted on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website or on other websites material that could be contrary to section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Tribunal finds that no conclusive evidence was tendered showing that this was the case. This said, if the Respondents feel that Mr. Warman has contravened section 13 of the Act, they can themselves file a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[32] As for Mr. Warman evasiveness in his testimony, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Warman's answers were not always straightforward and notes that a certain form of animosity existed between himself and Respondents' agents which led Mr. Warman to object to questions put to him because he felt they were not relevant. As stated earlier, the Tribunal will consider the whole of the evidence, testimonial, documentary and circumstantial to make its determination as to whether or not section 13 of the Act was breached by the Respondents.\nC. The status of the Canadian Heritage Alliance [33] In her testimony, Ms. Guille stated that the Canadian Heritage Alliance website was a means for people to express their views on free speech and government policies, that people could come to the website and post their articles and opinions, that they could start a thread in the forum section and exchange views, that debate was really promoted.\n[34] Ms. Guille testified that at first, individuals posting on the forum section had to join up but later did not have to. She added, however, that because of some nasty things being written in the forum section, individuals had eventually to sign up or register in order to be able to post in the forum section. This allowed her to have knowledge of their email and IP address. Ms. Guille stated that this did not entail joining a group but joining a website.\n[35] Ms. Guille stated in her testimony that if an individual wanted to post an article on the website, he would visit a specific link on the website, that this would give him a page with a user name field and a password field. The individual would then click submit and that would bring him to a form where he would post his material. When submitted, articles were posted immediately.\n[36] Ms. Guille testified that individuals joining the website needed to agree to the terms of service which stated that people were responsible for what they posted on the forum section and that they could not post things that were overtly hateful or crude. According to Ms. Guille, the number of people who joined the forum amounted at first to 100 then went down to around 20 to 30, that the number varied from year to year.\n[37] Ms. Guille expressed the view that the Canadian Heritage Alliance website was just a website. Asked about the membership, she stated that it was more a membership to the website, that there was, in fact, no membership list. Asked why a membership was created, she stated that it was to provide those interested in the website an information package explaining what the website was used for.\n[38] The documentation tendered in evidence by the Complainant, and the Commission which was obtained from the Canadian Heritage Alliance website, as well as the material produced by the Canadian Heritage Alliance, such as the Membership Guide, show that the Canadian Heritage Alliance describes itself as a collection of dissident writers and concerned Canadians who seek to revive the civil liberties of the Canadian citizen that have been smothered by the voice of special interest groups. The documentation indicates that the Canadian Heritage Alliance is centered in Southern Ontario, but has members all across Canada and in the USA. The information found on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website also refers to the fact that the CHA is a Canadian political lobby group, formed in August 2000 to give political expression to Canadian citizens.\n[39] The evidence further indicates that Canadian Heritage Alliance publishes a newsletter (Canadian Heritage News) and has staff journalists, that Ms. Guille is the Publications Director and Managing Editor of the Canadian Heritage News, that membership cards are issued as well as an information package.\n[40] Whether or not Canadian Heritage Alliance has a membership in the traditional sense of the word, i.e. individuals who become part of an organisation, are issued a membership card, have the right to elect members to a Board of directors, pay dues, receive a newsletter, is somewhat irrelevant, or at least not conclusive in this case to the determination as to whether or not the Canadian Heritage Alliance constitutes a group of persons acting in concert. The Canadian Heritage Alliance describes itself as a collection of dissident writers and concerned Canadians as well as a political lobby group. The Tribunal finds that this, in itself, is sufficient to establish that the Canadian Heritage Alliance constitues a group of persons acting in concert pursuant to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[41] Hence, the Tribunal finds that Canadian Heritage Alliance is more than a website, as argued by the Respondents, but that it is in fact a group of persons acting in concert for the purposes of section 13(1) of the Act. The Tribunal thus finds that the Canadian Heritage Alliance is a proper respondent in this case and that it is within the authority of the Tribunal to make an order as against it.\nD. The involvement of Ms. Guille in the Canadian Heritage Alliance [42] Beyond a shadow of a doubt, the record establishes that Ms. Guille is the site administrator or webmaster of the Canadian Heritage Alliance website. A WHO-IS search conducted by the Complainant reveals that Ms. Guille was, at the time of the complaint, the registrant contact, as well as the administrative, technical and billing contact of the Canadian Heritage Alliance website. A posting on the Canadian Heritage Alliance forum made by Ms. Guille indicates that she is the site administrator.\n[43] In an email exchange with David Mclean, a.k.a. Richard Warman, Ms. Guille states that she was one of the three individuals involved in the creation of the Canadian Heritage Alliance. She furthermore testified that she registered the url for the website and set up the website, i.e. created a visual page with information links, the title page and categories.\n[44] In her testimony, Ms. Guille acknowledged that she was the person who had the power to remove what had been put on the website, that she was the person who edited postings and articles and who designated the moderators for the website. She however added that she did not know their identity and had no authority over the moderators.\n[45] Asked what steps she took before deciding who would become a moderator, Ms. Guille answered that she looked at their postings on previous boards and made the decision to whether or not select them as moderators. She chose, she said, individuals who had a long history of posting on the forum and with whom she never had any problems. She testified that moderators could remove and edit material. Asked if it would not have been appropriate to have a more substantive record of who these people were, Ms. Guille stated that she did not feel that it was necessary.\n[46] Ms. Guille further testified that she did not know the identity of the individuals posting on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website. She stated that usually people will not provide their true identity, that the Canadian Heritage Alliance website is dedicated to free speech and that this meant discussing controversial issues that may not be part of every day conversations. Ms. Guille stated that controversial issues were for her immigration, free speech, race, culture, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation.\n[47] Asked who was in charge of the Canadian Heritage Alliance website forum, she stated that nobody was specifically in charge but that, as the administrator, she took care of the back-end content and that if she came across something that needed to be removed or edited, she would remove it.\n[48] Ms. Guille testified that were a few complaints about some of the postings, that if someone took strong exception to an article, she enjoyed it because it opened up the discussion and that if someone brought something to her attention as being problematic, the decision to remove the material would depend on the nature of the problem. Asked what she used to guide herself, she stated that she used her best judgment, that she could not hire a lawyer, that when she received the complaint, she realized that she had to take into account more that section 319 of the Criminal Code.\n[49] Given Ms. Guille's testimony, the Tribunal finds that Ms. Guille had full control over the Canadian Heritage Alliance website.\n[50] On another note, the evidence shows that Ms. Guille has close ties with neo-nazi and white supremacists sympathizers which, in this day and age, is quite disconcerting. Throughout her testimony, she refered to her friends, who are shown to be neo-nazi sympathisers on pictures tendered in evidence by the Commission, as associates. She stated candidly when asked if she had any difficulty sitting in a room with a nazi flag hanging on the wall that she did not see this as problematic.\n[51] Asked in the course of her testimony if she was a white supremacist or a neo-nazi, she stated that she was not, that she treated everybody equally, that in her university days, she had to deal with people of various racial backgrounds or sexual orientationss, and that today, in the relationship with her community and in her workplace, she did not have difficulty in getting along with people of different backgrounds.\n[52] There is not doubt in the Tribunal's mind that, over and above the fact that the Canadian Heritage Alliance website is a forum for discussion of very sensitive and controversial subjects, the people who are associates of Ms. Guille, the case law shows, have been found to be close to the neo-nazi and the white supremacist movements and found to have been in breach of section 13 of the Act. The Tribunal is however mindful that this, in itself, does not prove that Ms. Guille and the Canadian Heritage Alliance have violated section 13 of the Act.\n[53] Ms. Guille, the evidence shows, has strong views about her European heritage and is prepared to fight for its preservation. Ms. Guille testified that when she refers to the notion of culture, she refers to the European culture and when referring to the European culture, she is referring to her family heritage. For her, those who fall under the umbrella of European heritage are people from different parts of Europe and include people who have grown up in Europe or whose ancestors are from Europe.\n[54] Ms. Guille indicated in her testimony that for her, the European culture is different from the muslim faith, that, for her, Europe is a geographic region built up of different races such as Italians. Asked if in her definition of the European culture, she included people from Africa, Ms. Guille stated that it did not include Carribean immigrants to England and added that the latter did not consider themselves as Europeans because they wanted to hold on to their own cultural heritage.\n[55] In her testimony, Ms. Guille described herself as a nationalist who expressed her concerns about how Canada was evolving, about immigration and freedom of speech. She stated that she saw Canadians being oppressed whereas minorities had the right to free speech, that they benefited of more leniency, that Canadians were not allowed to speak out against anything that was going on. She also stated that she was proud of her country; she expressed the belief that every culture has its own rights, including the right to be free and equal within their own culture. Ms. Guille further stated that she had concerns abouth the high costs related to the integration of immigrants, that the money was not being used for education and the health care system.\n[56] Ms. Guille stated in her testimony that she opposes gay marriage and that she should be allowed to be for or against gay marriages. She testified that when she went to a gay marriage protest, there were people from other religious groups present. She expressed the belief that everyone has a right to free speech, that she believed that there should be unequivocal free speech aside from death threats and criminal acts.\n[57] Ms. Guille further testified that she was not aware of the existence of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act and that the articles and postings on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website violated section 13 of the Act even though she followed closely, the evidence shows, the Z\u00fcndel trial. Ms. Guille acknowledged that she was aware of the complaints made by Mr. Warman against Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson as well as Mr. Winnicki.\n[58] Ms. Guille further stated in her testimony that even after this hearing, she still did not know what violates the Canadian Human Rights Act, that the hearing has not given her insight as to what violates the Act, that the Act is vague and not clear at all as to what constitutes hate given that no clear guidelines exist. Hopefully, after reading this decision, Ms. Guille will.\nE. The constitutional challenge [59] In August 2007, the Respondent, Melissa Guille, filed a notice of constitutional challenge in relation to the present proceedings. In her notice, the Respondent indicates that it intends to question the constitutional applicability, validity and effect of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Tribunal ruled, at the time, that it would first hear the merits of the case, issue a decision and suspend the execution of its decision so as to allow the Respondent to duly present its notice of constitutional challenge before the Tribunal.\n[60] The record shows that in November 2007, Ms. Guille's agent made another request in which he asked the Tribunal to consider the notice of constitutional challenge before the resumption of the hearing on December 10, 2007. In a letter sent to the parties on November 20, 2007, the Tribunal issued the following directives which still hold: As indicated by the Tribunal's instruction of August 27, 2007, the Charter issue raised by the Respondent will be heard by the Tribunal at a later time, after the merits of the complaint.\nF. The security measures put in place at the hearing [61] The record shows that extraordinary measures were taken during the hearing to ensure the safety of everyone, the tribunal, the parties, their counsels or agents. The hearing was held in different venues. For the most part of the hearing, two Toronto policemen were present, one inside, the other outside of the hearing room. Two security agents were hired by the Tribunal to check personal belongings. Except for the Tribunal member and the Registry Officer, people were wanded with a metal detector. Furthermore, it appears that bodyguards were hired to ensure the protection of the Commission's lawyers and the Complainant. The measures put in place by the Tribunal were necessary to ensure the protection of everyone attending the hearing. They however, at times, created a tense atmosphere in the hearing room between the parties.\nIV. SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES [62] As stated by this Tribunal in Warman v. Warman, 2005 CHRT 36, the `purpose of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act is to remove dangerous elements of speech from the public discourse. The removal of these elements of speech from the public discourse promotes equality, tolerance and the dignity of the person. It also protects the member of minorities from the psychological harm caused by the dissemination of racial views which result inevitably in prejudice, discrimination and the potential of physical violence' (Warman, par. 36).\nA. Legal Issues [63] The burden of proving a breach of section 13 of the Act lies on the Complainant and the Commission. HE WHO ALLEGES MUST PROVE. In order to prove a breach of section 13 of the Act, the following questions must be answered in the affirmative:\nIs the material referred to in the complaints likely to expose a person or a group of persons to hatred and\/or contempt on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? Was the impugned material communicated repeatedly in whole or in part on the Canadian Heritage website? Did the Respondents, Melissa Guille and Canadian Heritage Alliance, communicate or cause to be communicated the impugned messages by means of the Internet? Is the Respondent, Canadian Heritage Alliance, a group of persons for the purpose of section 13(1) of the Act?\nThe Tribunal will analyse these different questions in turn.\nB. Legal Analysis (i) Is the material referred to in the complaints likely to expose a person or a group of persons to hatred and\/or contempt on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? [64] The Tribunal must first determine if the material found on the CHA website is likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt.\n[65] The words likely, expose, hatred or contempt have taken on a special meaning in the context of article 13 of the Act as the case law evolved. One of the leading cases is Nealy v. Johnston, (1989) 10 C.H.R.R., D6450 where the Tribunal analysed the wording of section 13 of the Act. Since then, the Tribunal has retained the interpretation given in Nealy to the words likely, expose, hatred or contempt.\n[66] In Nealy v. Johnston, the Tribunal stated that the wording likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt meant that is is not necessary that evidence be adducedd that any particular individual or group took the messages seriously and in fact directed hatred or contempt against another or others, that it was enough to prove that the matter in the messages was more likely than not to spark a positive reaction amongst some of the listeners to it which will likely in turn manifest itself in hatred and contempt towards the targets of the messages.\n[67] With respect to hatred, the Tribunal stated that the focus was a set of emotions and feelings which involve extreme ill will towards another person or groups of persons. To say that one hates another means in effect that one finds no redeeming qualities in the latter. The Tribunal went on to say that contempt is by contrast to hatred a term which suggests a mental process of looking down upon or treating as inferior the object of one's feelings.\n[68] As for the term expose, the Tribunal stated that an active or intent on the part of the communicator or a violent reaction on the part of the recipient are not envisaged, that to expose to hatred indicates a more subtle and indirect type of communication than vulgar abuse or overtly offensive language. For the Tribunal, expose meant to leave a person unprotected, to leave without shelter or defence, to lay open (to danger, ridicule, censure, etc.).\n[69] No expert evidence was called in the present case. The Respondents argued that the Tribunal could not determine the true nature of the material posted on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website without the benefit of such evidence. The fact of the matter is that it belongs to the Tribunal, given the criteria set out in the case law, to make the final determination as to whether or not a posting or an article is in breach of section 13 of the Act.\n[70] In Warman v. Kouba, 2006 CHRT 50, the Tribunal set out a non-exhaustive list of eleven hallmarks of hate messages, accompanied by an elaboration of on each of the hallmarks. These hallmarks are the following:\nThe Powerful Menace Hallmark: the targeted group is portrayed as a powerful menace that is taking control of the major institutions in society and depriving other of their livelihoods, safety, freedom of speech and general well-being; The True Story Hallmark: the messages use true stories, news reports, pictures and reference from purportedly reputable sources to make negative generalizations about targeted group; The Predator Hallmark: the targeted group is portrayed as preying upon children, the aged, the vulnerable, etc.; The Cause of Society's Problems Hallmark; the targeted group is blamed for the current problems in society and the world; The Dangerous or Violent by Nature Hallmark: the targeted group is portrayed as dangerous or violent by nature; The No Redeeming Qualities Hallmark: the messages convey the idea that members of the targeted group are devoid of any redeeming qualities and are innately evil; The Banishment Hallmark: the messages communicate the idea that nothing but the banishment, segregation or eradication of this group of people will save others from the harm being done by this group; The Sub-human Hallmark: the targeted group is de-humanized through comparisons to and associations with animals, vermin, excrement, and other noxious substances; The Inflammatory Language Hallmark: highly inflammatory and derogatory language is used in the messages to create a tone of extreme hatred and contempt; The Trivializing or Celebration of Past Tragedy Hallmark: the messages trivialize or celebrate past persecution or tragedy involving members of the targeted group; The Call to Violent Action Hallmark: calls to take violent action against the targeted group.\n[71] The evidence of the Complainant and of the Commission consisted mainly of Mr. Warman reading into the record passages of email strings found on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website as well as passages or the full text of articles found on the website.\n[72] As ruled above, the Tribunal will only be analysing the 8 examples referred to in the original complaint forms. The Tribunal has however reproduced the relevant excerpts of the other examples provided to the Tribunal by the Commission and the Complainant in an Annex to this decision.\n[73] Mr. Warman testified that he became aware of the Canadian Heritage Alliance website in the early 2000. He stated that he concluded that it was a neo-nazi and white supremacist website not only from the content of the site but also his knowledge of the individuals involved and their non website activities.\n[74] In his complaint forms, Mr. Warman refers to eight examples taken from the Canadian Heritage Alliance website that he believes constitute material that falls under section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Mr. Warman testified that the threads and articles were downloaded from the forum section of CHA's website.\n1. http:\/\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/forum\/viewtopic.php?t=492\n[75] In his complaint forms, the Complainant writes that these constitute forum postings in which it is argued that the Holocaust did not occur, that the gas chambers in concentration camps did not exist, that the media is controlled by Jews, and that Jewish-owned businesses should be boycotted and that Ms. Guille participated in this forum thread. The record shows that the title of the thread is: Auschwitz: Myths and Facts. This document was marked as Exhibit HR-1, C-1.\n[76] In his testimony, Mr. Warman read into the record the following posts made by different individuals using a pseudonym. Mr. Warman noted that one of the individuals, Fearless Beaver, presented himself as a moderator. Mr. Warman stated that he was limiting himself here to what he found to be reprehensible. Asked how he had accessed these posts, Mr. Warman stated that he went to the forum section of the Canadian Heritage Alliance website and accessed them directly. Membership was not required to access the site, he stated.\nPanzer-dragoon\nNearly everyone has heard of Auschwitz, the German wartime concentration camp where many prisoners -- most of them Jewish - were reportedly exterminated, especially in gas chambers. Auschwitz is widelily regarded as the most terrible Nazi extermination center. The camp's horrific reputation cannot, however, be reconciled with the facts.\nBizarre Tales\nAt one time it was seriously claimed that Jews were systematically electrocuted at Auschwitz, American newspapers, citing a Soviet eyewitness report from liberated Auschwitz, told reader in February 1945 that the methodological Germans had killed Jews using an electric conveyor belt on which hundreds of persons could be electrocuted simultaneously [and] then moved on into furnaces. They were burned almost instantly, producing fertilizer for nearby cabbage fields.\nAt at the Nuremberg Tribunal, chief U.S. prosecutor Robert Jackson charged that the Germans used a newly invented device to instantaneously vaporize 20 000 Jews near Auschwitz in such a way that there was no trace left of them. No reputable historian now accepts either of these fanciful tales.\nHe (Fred A. Leuchter) concluded by emphatically declaring that the alleged gassing facilities could not possibly have been used to kill people. Among other things, he pointed out that the so-called gas chambers were not properly sealed or vented to kill human beings without also killing German camp personnel.\nDr. William B. Lindsey, a research chemist employed for 33 years by the Dupont Corporation, likewise testified in a 1985 court case that the Auschwitz gassing is technically impossible. Based on a careful on-site examination of the gas chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek, and on his years of experience, he declared: I have come to the conclusion that no one was willfully or purposefully killed with Zyklon B (hydrocyanic acid gas) in this manner. I consider it absolutely impossible.\nI've been personally looking into this story going 6 years. I've read, heard and seen practically everything I could get my hands on from both sides of the fence. My basic conclusion. This story in large is a fraud, probably the biggest swindle in human history to date. Think of it as the Weapons of Mass Destruction of the 1940's.\nFearless Beaver\nThe holohoax is big business and the most important trump card for international zionism. Whether it is true or not doesn't matter. All that matters is that it is important.\nAngry taxpayer\nIt is all jewish zionist bullshit. The media is controlled and not free.\nThe world is under the power of the jewish zionists. They have all the money and power and influence and it is going to take some man\/woman or group to be able to expose and destroy it. A tough battle indeed.\n[77] Finally, Mr. Warman pointed out that Ms. Guille had made a post in relation to this string of posts. Ms. Guille's post, which is in response to the following post made by Panzer-Dragoon - I am one caucasian who is proud of is (sic) race, are you: reads as follows:\nAs much as the left would like us to feel shame in our culture, ancestry, and history, it's important we remember that we have NOTHING to feel guilty for. And being proud of one's identity is NOT shameful.\n[78] With respect to this first post, asked what she did when she saw the item referenced in the complaint form, Ms.Guille stated that by the time she received the complaint, these forum postings were already gone, that they had been on an old forum.\n[79] Asked with respect to this thread if she thought that the holocaust should be discussable (sic), she replied that for her, anything historical should be discussed and open to debate, because everybody has a different perspective on what happened. Asked with respect to that thread to comment on what she had written, she stated that she might not have read the first post because it was too long. She further stated that the content of threads could veer-off in a different direction than the first posting.\n2. http:\/\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/forum\/viewtopic.php?t=303\n[80] In his complaint forms, Mr. Warman writes that these Forum posting suggest that non-white women who have relationships with black men feel sorry for these nogs, that most whites who have relationships with black men have AIDS and\/or many sexually transmitted diseases as a result, that white women who have sexual relationships with black men deserve to die as a result, and that their children will have AIDS too. Mr. Warman goes on to state that this is the clean version after Ms. Guille herself edited one of the postings citing concern over Canadian hate laws. The record shows that the title of the thread is: Which brings me to the race mixing. This document was marked as Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-5.\n[81] It must be noted here that in this thread, Kwazimodo is referred to as a moderator and that, in response to one of the post made by cyanid_assassin, Ms. Guille refers to the Forum rules. Furthermore, it must be noted that Ms. Guille presents herself as the Site Adm(nistrator).\n[82] In his testimony, Mr. Warman read into the record the following posts:\nSonofthesun\nA lot of people would say this isnt a big deal but I think it is. Here are some examples: do you mix 2 different kinds of cereal together for breakfast? Would you buy a car made up of half ford and half chevy. Do you mix grape juice with orange juice. So why create parts and hybrids of human flesh. - are we dogs.\nCyanide_assassin\nHey I agree with you all the way all I see in my city is wiggers and half breeds its just wrong, my kids, when I have them will be going to school with these things and at this pace there should be many more in 5 years were going to be infested with them someone needs to open the eyes of these stupid chicks were in trouble.\nGladius\nYou can thank the media and all the brainwashing that comes with it. Oh, and politics, well, political correctness. I think white girls feel sorry for these nogs or they think its fashionable or they are showing the world (society) how UNracist they are. What ever happened to instinctive traits like staying with your own kind?\nCyanide_assassin\nno matter what we do were in for a long slow battle that may never be won if its cool to be white again then we lose anyway,\ndo you want to befriend or fuck a converted wigger? I don't.\nif all of a sudden north america stoped liking rap and blacks, all the white girls and guys will want white again and then the white race will be fucked because most wiggers have aids and many std's from the black man,\nim sure you all see the way the hiphop influenced people, behave they all fuck each other usually with no protection. I say let them all die off, fuck the wiggers, they've made there choice, all the little mud children will have aids too.\none more thing why do you think the so called sisters don't take their black men back from these stupid wiggers, im sure they need dick but nobody wants to fuck a black girl except a black man but their too busy fuckn the white chicks, so if there are any black girls on here (better not be).\nYou're not a threat. You're a fucking disease.\n[83] At the end of the post, it is mentioned that it was edited by admin. Follows the following post by Melissa:\nMelissa, Site Admin\nCyanid Assassin, I understand your frustration, but please keep in mind the forum rules. Any commentary advocating violence are not tolerated on the forum and will be edited and could lead to banning. Our anger and frustration can be revealed by educating ourselves and others about the current situation and actively fighting it in a non-violent way.\nSpecifically\n1. Any messages, data, or images that might be considered to be obscene or which advocates violence will not be tolerated. Re the C.H.A statement: Canadian Heritage Alliance does not condone the use of violence to achieve political and social change.

But we can follow their racist, oppressive, outrageous laws because we have fact, truth, and reason on our side. Though it's not much when the leaders and lawmakers in Canada are not rational people themselves - but the public listens.\nAnd it's the people we need to educate to help us fight the laws our politicians are using as weapons to keep us from revealing the truth.\nKwazimodo, moderator\nWhen a superior race breeeds with an inferior race, then the outcome may be superior to the inferior race but must be inferior the the superior race.\nOnce you go black, you can never go back.

Kwazimodo (Mr. Warman's rough translation was: Attention, Race mixing is forbidden).\n[84] Mr Warman mentioned, in his testimony, that Ms. Guille had a post that followed without reading it into the record. The post reads as follows:\nI really don't watch much TV, and less since the programs and commercials all seem to include a political viewpoint. BUT only one viewpoint. Our viewpoint is censured (what happened to Free Speech?) All I can say is I'm thankful for the ability to block channels on TV.\n[85] Ms. Guille testified, in relation to this thread, that the person who starts a thread creates the title. Ms. Guille added that every culture or most cultures feel the same about losing their own identity, that she did not see why European people should be prevented from discussing this topic. She acknowledged that this was a hot topic. She acknowledged having read of few postings on the topic of interracial relationship.\n[86] With respect to the post by cyanide_assassin, Ms. Guille testified that she remembered having edited this post so that the person could get his point across but taking out a lot of the grotesque description it contained. She stated that she believed that this post was part of the old forum and that it was gone by the time she received the complaint. Ms. Guille testified that given the frustration expressed by cyanide_ assassin, she felt that she needed to remind him of the forum rules, notably that any comment advocating violence would not be tolerated on the forum and would be edited and could lead to banning.\n[87] Asked to explain the meaning of the word wiggers, she stated that they are white people who have taken on the Black culture, listen to rap music, identify themselves with the black culture, and the social attributes that go with it. Asked about her own post, what she meant by egg-shells, she stated that she was referring to the fact that the political correctness laws in Canada are very limiting and prevent people from discussing issues which some feel important, that they generate a sense of anger.\n[88] For Ms. Guille, people need to talk about things so as to get it out of their system. Ms. Guille further acknowledged that there were things that she could not allow people to say but that she did not get offended easily. She stated that she would edit what she thought might be offensive. Asked if she edited comments about violence because she found them offensive or wrong, she answered because she found them wrong and that there were no reasons to talk about hurting people.\n[89] Asked in cross-examination if he found that the postings made by Ms. Guille here were contrary to section 13 of the Act, Mr. Warman answered that this question cannot be answered in isolation but stated that Ms. Guille was discriminating against non-white when one considers the messages in their entirety and totality.\n3. http:\/\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/news_opinion\/articles\/pierce\/hell.html\n[90] In his complaint forms, Mr. Warman states that this article is the clean version posted by Ms. Guille in order to attempt to protect herself against Canadian anti-hate legislation. According to Mr. Warman, this article claims slavery is legal in Israel, that one of Israel's embassies ran a child prostitution ring, that the Jews control the media, that 3 Jews controlled a huge child pornography ring from Moscow that showed children being raped, tortured and killed, that those who control the media should be exterminated root and branch as a class, that Russians have a valid reason for hating the Jews, that Jews are responsible for organized crime in Russia, that Jews murdered tens of millions of Russians, that Jews have forced thousands of young Russian women into prostitution, and now they kidnap Russian children to rape and sexually torture to death for child-porn films. That those Jews not involved in child-pornography cover for those who do. Mr. Warman notes that the full version of this article had already been found by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to constitute hate messaging in the Warman v. Kyburz case, 2003 CHRT 18.\n[91] The record shows that the title of the article is: There will be hell to pay, by Dr. William Pierce. This document was marked as Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-11. Mr. Warman noted again at the hearing that this article was found in Warman v. Kyburz to be in violation of section 13 of the Act. Mr. Warman noted that the Canadian Heritage Alliance indicates that the article needed to be edited so that it would conform to Canadian legislation and that the full article could be found here, with a link to the full text. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record long excerpts of this article. Here are some of the more salient excerpts:\nWhite-slave business flourishes in Israel because in that country slavery is not illegal (...)\nThe Jews have a tighter grip on the news media in the United States than almost anywhere else in the world and are quite successful at keeping most Americans from hearing about their shenanigans.\nThe freaks, I an sorry to say, are not all Jews, although Jews are ( ) represented among them. The majority, in fact, are Gentiles. I don't know what makes people become so perverse that they enjoy watching a film of a five-year old girl being raped and sexually tortured.\nMy view is that such people should simply be killed on the spot whenever and wherever they are found. More than that, the people who promote and encourage this extreme individualist mind-set through their control of the media should be exterminated root and branch as a class. Does that sound extreme?\nTwenty thousand dollars for a film of a little blond, blue-eyed Russian girl being raped to death; 1,700 customers for such films. Well, I guess there must be some pretty rich ( ) filmmakers in Moscow. And you haven't heard a word about any of it before my broadcast today, have you? Can you imagine what it would have been like if real Russians instead of ( ) gangsters had been kidnapping and murdering little Jewish children in Moscow so they could film the murders and sell copies of the film to rich Gentile pervents? It would have been on television firmly warning the Russian government that it must do more to catch the Gentiles responsible and to protect the Jews from them. The Jews would be moaning about the Holocaust again and holding out their hands for reparations from the Russian government.\nAnd it's why I recently have begun reexamining the whole subject of Jewish ritual murder - because, you know, it worked in the past the same way it works today. Some little group of ( ) perverts or ( ) religious fanatics carrying out some hate-filled injunction in the Talmud gets caught for murdering a Gentile child, and the other ( ) try to buy off the authorities.\nWell, as I said, one of these days there will be hell to pay, and that day can't come too soon.\n[92] Ms. Guille testified that Dr. Pierce advised her that it should be edited to conform to Canadian laws. Ms. Guille also stated in her testimony that the edits she made are reflected by the three little dots that appear between the square brackets. Ms. Guille further stated that this article, before it was removed, was in the article database on the website and that anyone could post an article, that people could read the article but could not post comments.\n[93] Asked what she did when she received the complaint, Ms. Guille stated that she removed the edited version of the article. Asked how she felt about having to edit the article, she stated that for her, it was just an opinion, that she was upset that people could not enjoy the full article in Canada. Asked what guide she had when editing the article, Ms. Guille testified that she read it as somebody who would be offended by comments in the article, that she tried to find what might be offensive to people, that she thought that she had edited it enough and added that it appears that she had not.\n4. http:\/\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com news_opinion\/ articles\/millard\/death.html\n[94] In his complaint forms, Mr. Warman writes that this article states that non-white immigration and miscegenation is genocide against whites that is worse than the Black Plague that struck Europe in the Middle Age, that miscegenation is like AIDS, that non-white immigration promises to wipe out all Europeans.\n[95] The record shows that the title of the article is The Black Plague and was written by H. Millard and submitted by Joe. This document was marked as Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-13. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read long excerpts of this article into the record. Here are some of the most salient excerpts:\nThere are a variety of names for various aspects of this new Black Death: non white immigration, cross-breeding, miscegenation, blending, assimilation, genocide, low birth rates. Call it what you will. It is a reality. Whites are dying as a people, and we who are now alive are watching it happen right before our eyes. Our people are being erased from the Earth.\nUnfortunately, many white people either don't even know about the new Black Death, or if they do they are often unconcerned about it. White minds have become so infected that whites are often alienated and completely unconnected to who and what they are, so when they hear of whites becoming extinct, it doesn't phase them. So what, they may say. There are plenty of people on the planet.\nThe new Black Death is far more insidious and infects the genes of a person and is passed on to every child who is born. It wipes out entire family lines that have been in existence for hundreds of thousands of years and robs people of their natural right to exist as white people. This new Black Death turns white people into non-white people, and in a single generation it can destroy a family line, and turn all its members into carriers of the Black Death.\nOnce the genes of a family are infected, there is no cure. You can actually watch as entire white families turn ever darker.\nThe Black Death transforms white people into non-white people. The white skin turns dark. The hair gets dark. The facial features change. The eyes turn dark. The voice changes. The brain changes. They are no longer white people. There are those who argue that this isn't a bad thing and that it is just natural, but one cannot argue that it is the death of white people when this happens.\nYou can be certain that no one will try to save white people from extinction if white people won't do it themselves.\nThe Black Death lurks in the genes, and like AIDS it is spread through sexual contact. Every mating of a white person with a non-white person helps spread the Black Death and kills off with genes.\nProtect your family from the Black Death.\nTeach your children the truth about genes, race, history, and about the virulent white haters who are pushing the Black Death disguised as anti-racism, tolerance, and diversity.\nTeach your children how to survive, and how to avoid genocide, extinction, and non-being.\n[96] Ms. Guille acknowledged in her testimony that the article was on the website, but that she was not the author of the article and that she was not the person who posted it. She testified that she first found out that this article was problematic when she received the complaint and stated that she removed it within a week of receiving the complaint.\n[97] Asked if she found anything offensive in the article, she stated that she did not read it until she removed it, that she did not personally find it offensive, that every culture has a feeling of self preservation and that it was an opinion. Ms. Guille further testified that she found the article to be interesting and did not find anything that might have been contrary to section 13 of the Act or the criminal law.\n[98] Ms. Guille expressed the view that the subject matter of the article was opened for discussion. Asked if she agreed that whites are dying as a people, she answered that she agreed with this and went on to say that she believed these statements to be true, i.e. that our people (white people) are being erased from the earth.\n5. http:\/\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/news_opinion\/articles\/gullet\/christian-identity.html\n[99] In his complaint forms, Mr. Warman writes that this article states that Jews murdered Jesus and are the anti-Christ, that Jews are the literal children of Satan, that Jews promote non-white immigration and miscegenation in order to serve Satan and destroy Western man, that it is our duty to drive out the Jews, that Jews are wicked and that we must begin the eternal destruction of the wicked. The title of the article is: Our Christian Idenity (sic) and was written by Pastor Morris L. Gullet. The document was filed as Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-14. The article contains long citations from the Bible interspersed by personal comments. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record long excerpts of this article. Here are the more salient ones.\nThe Torah to the Jew is the first five books of the Bible. That is all that they say is valid. But you see, they give their own Talmud and oral law more credence than the Torah even. See the comment on shrewd pragmatism. That means whatever works for the Jew. And they can change their law to suit their purposes whenever they please. Shrew pragmatism hhh. This is simply another way of being decepetive. A play on words is what it is. But what do you expect from a people who Jesus said were of the Devil the father of lies.\n( )\nNow that we have identified who Israel is and who Israel is not. We have identified the enemies of the Living God to be the anti-Christ Jew, the descendants of Satan. The people against whom YHVH hath indignation forever. It is indeed a blessing now to know and understand the word of God and to know that we are among His called and chosen few. We have much work to do. So it is time to be busy about our fathers work. The awakening of our kindred Israel, the eternal destruction of the wicked and the bringing in of the kingdom of our Father and God, YHVH ...\n[100] Ms. Guille acknowledged that this article was posted on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website but that she was not the person who posted it. She further stated that when she received the complaint, she removed the posting.\n[101] With respect to this article, Ms. Guille testified that she was aware that this article had been posted and added that there were other articles dealing with religion on the website that reflected different views.\n6. http:\/\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/ news_opinion\/articles\/francis\/shocked.html\n[102] In his complaint forms, Mr. Warman writes that this article states that African immigrants to France are annihilating Parisian and French civilization, that millions of African and Muslim immigrants are torching Paris, and their cousins in London, England eat rat feces as a delicacy. ...if you allow millions of savages to invade your country, the country will become a land of savages.\n[103] The record shows that the title of this article is Shocked, Shocked to Find Racial Polarization Going On! The article is written by Samuel Francis and it is mentioned that it was submitted by Graeme Voyer. This document was marked as Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-22.\n[104] At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record long excerpts of the article that he found objectionable. Here are a few salient excerpts:\nWhile the millions of African and Muslim immigrants are torching Paris, their cousins in London are feasting. In that city, projected to have a non-white majority by 2010, police investigating a mysterious human torso recently found floating in the Thames suspect that human flesh is being sold in local markets, according to Last week's Observer. (Human flesh on sale in London, Antony Barnett, Paul Harris and Tony Thompson, Observer, Sunday November 3, 2002).\nThere's no doubt that such rare delicacies as crocodiles' heads, chimpanzee meat, and (my own personal favorite) West African bushrat are being - well - gobbled up at fancy prices in London by African immigrants whose descendants will inherit the city of Johnson and Dickens, The torso itself is believed to be that of a five-year old African boy who was the victim of a ritualistic killing linked to a West African form of voodoo-like religion. The crocodiles heads are medicinal, since they're believed to increase male sexual potency.\nAs in Paris, of course, there is a geographical answer or something like it to explain why the future population of Great Britain is suddenly adopting cannibalism, witchcraft and human sacrifice. That's the answer most newspapers, commentators, academics, and even police will give you.\nAnd then there's the real answer - that if you allow millions of savages to invade your country, the country will become a land of savagery.\n[105] Ms. Guille acknowledged that this article appeared on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website. She stated in her testimony that she became aware that this article was problematic when she received the complaint and removed it from the website. She stated that she read the article after receiving the complaint but not in full.\n[106] Asked if she saw in the article anything that she considered to be hateful, she answered in the negative, that this was something that was happening in France and could be discussed. Asked to comment on the paragraph starting by There's no doubt, Ms. Guille stated that she found nothing hateful about the paragraph, that it was an opinion based on news articles from newspapers such as The Observer. She further expressed the view that if news can be reported, why should discussing it be hateful.\n7. http:\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com news_opinion\/articles\/kwazimodo\/911.html\n[107] In his complaint forms, Mr. Warman refers to the fact that the article states that no Jews died in the attacks in New York City on 11 September 2001 and that this was because they were warned in advance to stay away, that Osama bin Laden is Jewish and that the attacks were in fact part of a Jewish plot. The title of the article is: 9\/11 Wrapped Up, and is written by Kwazimodo. The document was marked as Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-34B. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the records the following passages of the article:\nAt the last count on file here, the death toll was something like Gentiles: 2800, Jews:0. This leads one to suspect that there was foreknowledge of 9\/11 plans in certain quarters so that one section of the population normally present in the Twin Towers could receive a warning to stay away, while the rest of the population could be blissfully unaware. The problem, as seen here, is how could such an intricate operation as 9\/11 be in the planning process and execution, highly secretive, and yet be known to jewish interest?\nYour humble servant has had a revelation. It was disclosed in a publication from an Australian source of high credibility that Osama bin Laden's mother is jewish. Another source in England supplied the information that the has a sister living in a part of London, England, that is a heavily jewish neghbourhood. Now jewish law states that if a mother is jewish, then the child is jewish. This gives rise to the following Syllogism:\nJewish law states that if a mother is jewish , then the child is jewish\nOsama bin Laden's mother is jewish\nTherefore Ossam bin Laden is jewish\nNow we ask you, when you connect the dots, do you see any connection betweeen Osama bin Laden (paragraph 2) and jewish interests (paragraph 1) which could explain the casualty count in 9\/11? Sorry it took so long to piece together, but your obscure writer does not have the resources of Mr. Asper's newspaper empire\n[108] Ms. Guille acknowleged that this article was on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website at the time of the complaint, that she did not write it and that when she received the complaint, she removed the article as well as another similar article. Ms. Guille testified that prior to the complaint, she had not read this article.\n[109] Asked if she saw any problem with the article, Ms. Guille stated not overtly, that it was an opinion piece, but stated that she would not agree with the article. She further stated that there had been a lot of points of view posted on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website about 9\/11. Ms. Guille added that she did not know who Kwazimodo was even if she had appointed him as a moderator.\n8. www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/news_opinion\/articles\/unknown\/crimes.html\n[110] In his complaint forms, Mr. Warman states that this collection repeats historical anti-semitic hate propaganda that purports to show Jewish crimes throughout the past several hundred years, that Judaism is Demonic and a Darkness unto the nations, that Jews seek to invade, dominate, enslave wherever they are with the goal of Jewish world domination (p.1 of 14) , that Judaism is .... like some pernicious infection that destroys the body that it has invaded. (p.3). Mr. Warman goes on to reproduce excerpts of the article:\nOur anti-Semitism, therefore, is not to be confused with call for violence, for disorder, or for pointless recriminations: on the contrary, it must be a doctrine of clairvoyance, of systematic protection; our anti-Semitism will be embodied in binding regulations and adamantine laws that must and shall be - like it or not! - enforced by the full power of the State!\n.....\nSpare a Tear for the Dead of Auschwitz. The only living being that the Germans exterminated at Auschwitz was - the louse.\nEither\/Or. We must now solve the most urgent of all problems, and that is, of course, the Jewish Problem; there are only two alternatives: we must expel them, or we must massacre them.\n[111] The title of this article is Museum of Jewish Crimes and is written by unknow authors. This document was marked as Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-36. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record long excerpts of this 14 page long article. The Tribunal has reproduced herein some of the most salient excerpts:\nGeorge Batault\nInvade, Dominate, Enslave. In their deepest essence unadapted, and in a very real sense unadaptable, to the particular nation to which they allegedly belong, the Jews fatally and instinctively strive to reform and transform the host nation's institutions in such a way that laws and customs become solely and exclusively adaptable to the ends that the Jews themselves pursue; these ends may seem at first to be practical, but ultimately, and above all, the goals turn out to be messianic in their scope and intent. The ultimate imperial destiny toward which the Jews are striving, notwithstanding temporary trials and failures along the way, will always remain the unconditional victory of Israel, which will usher in the ultimate reign over the prostate world that Israel has at last conquered and enslaved, according to the explicit prophecy of Isaiah.\nJudaism insinuating, tenacious, and mysterious, an entity that grew and spread across the ancien world like some perinicious infection that destroys the body that it has invaded. As the initial success, and ultimately the toal victory, of Judaic conceptions have marked the decline and then the downfall of the ancient world, we are completely justified in maintaining that the Jews brought absolutely nothing to ancient civilization except the most powerful ferment of dissolution.\nJakob Friedrich Fries\nTherefore, the Jewish sect must be torn out root and branch from German soil, since it quite obvious that of all the secret political societies the most dangerous is Jewry, just as of all the states within the state the most dangerous is Jewry. (How Jewry Imperils Germany, 1816)\nCharles Hagel\nOur anti-Semitism, therefore, is not to be confused with call for violence, for disorder, or for pointless recriminations: on the contrary it must be a doctrine of clairvoyance, of systematic protection; our anti-Semitism will be embodied in binding regulations and adamantine laws that must and shall be - like it or not! - enforced by the full power of the State!\nJoris-Karl Huysmans\nOne must wonder what on earth is happening here in the Frankfurt ghetto, which bears so little resemblance to the Foelistrat in Amsterdam, a lazar-house that features the more familiar Jewish types, where both men and women sport abundant manes of kinky hair, oozing eyes, noses shaped like the snouts of tapirs, gaping mouths, and shiny brows perpetually dusted by the flour of dandruff.\nDarquier de Pellepoix\nSpare a Tear for the Dead of Auschwitz. The only living being that the Germans exterminated at Auschwitz was - the louse.\nEither\/Or. We must now solve the most urgent of all problems, and that is, of course, the Jewish Problem; there are only two alternatives: we must expel them, or me must massacre them.\nF. Trocase\nYou Know Who Is to Blame! Anti-Semitism would not possess such mighty roots if there were not such mighty reasons that both explain and justify its existence:\nWho buys the house and its furniture after having ruined its former owners? The Jew!\nWho evicts the poor peasant from this ancestral hearth? The Jew!\nWho encourages the spread of moral filth and degradation among young people? The Jew!\nWho concocts fraudulent bankruptcies? The Jew!\nWho steals from the worker the fruits of his labors? The Jew!\nWho exploits political passions to satisfy his lust and to fill hir coffers? The Jew!\nWho is the real cause of economic depressions? The Jew!\n[112] In her testimony, Ms. Guille stated that she was not the person who posted the article which appeared in the Canadian Heritage Alliance article database. She further testified that after receiving the complaint, she removed the article. For her, the article appears to be a legitimate historical collection of a timeline and that she did not see anything wrong with it.\n[113] The evidence indicates that Ms. Guille, upon receiving the complaint form which cites 8 examples and the additional disclosure which refers to 37 or so posting and articles, removed the material from the CHA website. There is no reason for the Tribunal to doubt that Ms. Guille did in fact removed the articles and postings referred to above. Mr. Warman and the Commission did not adduced evidence to the contrary.\n[114] Ms. Guille testified that at one time, there was close to 1 000 articles on the website and that now the number was around 300 to 350 and that the eight postings or articles referred to in the complaint forms were not amongst the remaining articles. In her testimony, Ms. Guille acknowledged that the articles posted on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website are controversial.\n[115] Asked why she removed all these postings, Ms. Guille stated that if obviously it was a problem, her idea of what is acceptable is not necessarily what other would find acceptable, that at any time someone could have contacted her and let her know that there was a problem with one of the posts or one of the articles and she would definitely have removed it but that, unfortunately, it came in the form of a complaint and that the only way she could offset any hurt feelings and offence that someone took to the post was to remove it. Ms. Guille acknowledged that there had been occasionally in the past complaints and that she would removed an article if someone took offence to it. Ms. Guille stated that there were only a handful of complaints.\n[116] To determine if a respondent has violated section 13 of the Act, the Tribunal has to determine if the material posted is likely to expose a person or persons to contempt and hatred by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. The determining factor is not the numbers of postings or articles that are put on a website but the content of the material and the context in which they are made public.\n[117] Applying to the posts and articles referred to above, and more specifically to the passages that the Complainant and the Commission alleged to be in contravention of section 13 of the Act the criteria set out by the Tribunal in Warman v. Kouba, the Tribunal finds that the following passages are of such a nature to likely expose Jews and Blacks to hatred or contempt:\nMy view is that such people should simply be killed on the spot whenever and wherever they are found. More than that, the people who promote and encourage this extreme individualist mind-set through their control of the media should be exterminated root and branch as a class. Does that sound extreme? (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-11) Those who control the media (the Jews)should be exterminated root and branch as a class. (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-11) Well, as I said, one of these days there will be hell to pay, and that day can't come too soon (reference to the Jews). (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-11) Now that we have identified who Israel is and who Israel is not. We have identified the enemies of the Living God to be the anti-Christ Jew, the descendants of Satan. The people against whom YHVH hath indignation forever. It is indeed a blessing to know and understand the word of God and to know that we are among His called and chosen few. The elect of the Lord. We have much work to do. So it is time to be busy about our fathers work. The awakening of our kindred Israel, the eternal destruction of the wicked and the bringing in the kingdom of ou Father and God, YHVH. (HR-1, Tab. C-14) And then there's the real answer - that if you allow millions of savages (i.e. Blacks) to invade your country, the country will become a land of savagery. (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-22) Therefore, the Jewish sect must be torn out root and branch from German soil, since it quite obvious that of all the secret political societies the most dangerous is Jewry, just as of all the states within the state the most dangerous is Jewry. (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-36) Either\/Or. We must now solve the most urgent of all problems, and that is, of course, the Jewish Problem; there are only two alternatives: we must expel them, or we must massacre them. (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-36)\n[118] These are not the only passages taken from the above referred to threads and articles that can be considered as likely to generate hostility and violence creating the right conditions for hatred or contempt. They are the more blatant ones. They undoubtedly put at risk the well-being and safety of Jewish individuals as well as Blacks. They constitute a clear call for the elimination of certain groups of individuals or their expulsion from the place where they live.\n[119] Other postings and articles depict certain groups in such a way as to stir up a sentiment of repulsion towards them compromising their safety, well-being and dignity:\nHey I agree with you all the way all I see in my city is wiggers and half breeds its just wrong, my kids, when I have them will be going to school with these things. (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-5) You're not a threat. You're a fucking disease. (about black girls) (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-5) Do you want to befriend or fuck a converted wigger? I don't. If all of a sudden north america stoped liking rap and blacks, all the white girls and guys will want white again and then the white race will be fucked because most wiggers have aids and many std's from the black man.\nIm sure you all see the way the hiphop influenced people, behave they all fuck each other usually with no protection. I say let them all die off, fuck the wiggers, they've made there choice, all the little mud children will have aids too. (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-5)\nThe New Black Death, unlike the earlier one, isn't sneaking in on the back of rats, but is sneaking in by airplaine, by car, and on foot. There are a variety of names for various aspects of this new Black Death: non white immigration, cross-breeding, miscegenation, blending, assimilation, genocide, low birth rates. (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-13) Spare a Tear for the Dead of Auschwitz. The only living being that the Germans exterminated at Auschwitz was - the louse. (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-36) The more familiar Jewish types, where both men and women sport abundant manes of kinky hair, oozing eyes, noses shaped like the snouts of tapirs, gaping mouths, and shiny brows perpetually dusted by the flour of dandruff. (Exhibit HR-1, Tab. C-36)\n[120] The material referred to above in itself, the language used by the authors, the tone of the material posted, the general context of the postings, all put together, disclose an undeniable scent of overt resentment, hatred, contempt for certain groups of individuals based on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[121] Freedom of expression is a cherished value in Canada. Freedom of expression has been enshrined of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, as any other freedom, it is not absolute. Promoting traditional European values in not a crime. Promoting the extermination of non-whites, of non European people, however, constitutes a threat to their existence and their security. Promoting the expulsion from a country of certain ethnic groups likewise constitutes a threat to their safety and their well-being.\n[122] If Ms. Guille is true to herself, i.e. promoting what she calls European values, there is no need for her to vilify or let others vilify people from other geographic regions, or from other ethnic backgrounds than the European background. Unless the promotion of European values entails the extermination of all other ethnic groups who are not from the Old Europe as well as the expulsion from Canada of every person who is not of European descent.\n[123] The Tribunal is of the view that it is not an excuse for Ms. Guille to say that she did not write an article or did not post an article on the Canadian Heritage website which might be in breach of section 13 of the Act. As the site administrator or webmaster, she is responsible for what is put on the website she administers and over which she exercises, as the evidence indicates, full control. It is her responsibility to put in place the proper controls so that if hate messages, threads or articles, are posted, they will not breach section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act and violate the fundamental freedoms that each Canadian enjoy, no matter his or her ethnic origin, i.e. the right to the dignity of his or her person, the right to life, the right to the security of his or her person.\n[124] As part of the Respondents' defense, Mr. Kulbashian, Ms. Guille's agent, put in evidence a number of articles which dealt with the Palestinian and Israeli conflict, as well as articles pertaining to racial segregation. He also tendered in evidence lyrics from Eminem which Mr. Kulbashian had downloaded from the web and which were, in his opinion, violent, racist and anti-homosexuals.\n[125] The Tribunal agrees with Counsel for the Commission that the use of reprehensible and violent language, even by a famous rap group, does not legitimize the use of the same type of language in another context or forum. It cannot serve as a benchmark for the determination as to whether or not material put on a website contravenes section 13 of the Act.\n[126] The Tribunal thus finds that the material referred to above is likely to expose to hatred or contempt a person or persons by reason of the fact that that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination and thus contravenes section 13 of the Act.\n(ii) Was the impugned material communicated repeatedly in whole or in part on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website? [127] In Schnell v. Michiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc, 2002 CHRT 11\/02, the Tribunal stated that the word repeatedly in s.13(1) of the Act suggests that this section is aimed not at private communications with friends, but rather at a series of messages that form a larger-scale, public scheme for the dissemination of certains ideas or opinions, designed to gain converts from the public.\n[128] The evidence shows that the Canadian Heritage Alliance website hosted a forum section where individuals were allowed to start threads and post articles. This forum was not of a private nature and everyone accessing the website could read the material posted on the website. The public nature of the Canadian Heritage Alliance website clearly comes out of Mr. Guille's testimony as indicated earlier. Ms. Guille stated in her testimony that the Canadian Heritage Alliance website was a means for people to express their views on free speech and government policies, that people could come to the website and post their articles and opinions, that they could start a thread in the forum section and exchange views, that debate was really promoted.\n[129] The Tribunal thus finds that there is nothing private about the Canadian Heritage Alliance website and that, given its nature as well as the means of accessing it, the Respondents communicated and caused to be communicated repeatedly the postings and articles found by Mr. Warman on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website which forms part of his complaint.\n(iii) Did the Respondents, Melissa Guille and Canadian Heritage Alliance, communicate or cause to be communicated the impugned messages by means of the Internet? [130] There can be no doubt, given the evidence adduced by the Complainant and the Commission that the Canadian Heritage Alliance website was accessible via the Internet as well as the impugned material. Ms. Guille's testimony as well as that of Mr. Warman are conclusive on this point.\n(iv) Is the Respondent, Canadian Heritage Alliance, a group of persons for the purposes of section 13(1) of the Act? [131] The evidence clearly establishes that the Canadian Heritage Alliance is a group of persons for the purposes of section 13(1) of the Act. As found herein, the Canadian Heritage Alliance decribes itself as as a collection of dissident writers and concerned Canadians who seek to revive the civil liberties of the Canadian citizen that have been smothered by the voice of special interest groups as well as a Canadian political lobby group, formed in August 2000 to give political expression to Canadian citizens. The Canadian Heritage Alliance falls thus under the authority of the Tribunal and the Tribunal is entitled to make an order against it.\n[132] Hence, the Tribunal finds that Ms. Guille and the Canadian Heritage Alliance have breached section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act in that as a person and as a group of persons acting in concert they have communicated via the Internet or caused to be so communicated repeatedly, in whole or in part, matters that are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nV. REMEDIES [133] The Complainant and the Commission seek the following remedies:\nAn order that the Respondents and anyone acting in concert with them cease the discriminatory practice, pursuant to section 54(1)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act; An order that the Respondent, Melissa Guille, pay a penalty pursuant to section 54(1)(c).\nA. Cease and Desist Order [134] The Complainant and the Commission seek a permanent cease and desist order in accordance with paragraph 54(1)(a) of the Act in order to have Ms. Guille and the Canadian Heritage Alliance cease the discriminatory practice of communicating hate messages through the Internet or other federal telecommunications undertaking.\n[135] Section 54(1)(a) of the Act reads as follows:\nIf a member or panel finds that a complaint related to a discriminatory practice describred in section 13 is substantiated, the member or panel may make only one or more of the following orders:\n(a) an order containing terms referred to in paragraph 53(2)(a).\nAs for paragraph 53(2)(a), it reads:\nIf at the conclusion of the inquiry, the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropritate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in the future.\n[136] More specifically, the Commission and the Complainant request an order using the same wording as that used by Member Doucet at paragraph 169(1) of the Tremaine decision with Ms. Guille and the Canadian Heritage Alliance substituted for that of Mr. Tremaine. The Commision and the Complainant further ask that the term and anyone acting in concert with Ms. Guille and the CHA be included.\n[137] Paragraph 169(1) of the Tremaine decision reads as follows:\nTerry Tremaine, and any other individuals who act in concert with Mr. Tremaine, cease the discriminatory practice of communicating telephonically or causing to be communicated telephonically by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking with the legislative authority of Parliament, material of the type that was found to violate section 13(1) in the present case, or any other messages of a substantially similar content, that are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, contrary to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[138] The Respondents submit in their written pleadings that should there be a negative finding in this case, a limited cease and desist order of one year be imposed. According to the Respondents, an open cease and desist order is a life sentence. The Respondents argued that a lifetime cease and desist order would make it highly risky for Miss Guille to ever again discuss controversial matters that are the subject of this complaint on the Internet and express the view that the call for such a cease and desist order strongly suggests that the real purpose of the complaint is the silencing of a political opponent and not the remediation of discrimination.\n[139] Given the remedial nature of the Act and the powers given to the Tribunal by section 54 of the Act, the Tribunal will issue a cease and desist order and will require that Ms. Guille, in consultation with the Commission, take measures to redress the practice or prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in the future.\nB. Order to pay a penalty [140] The Complainant and the Commission seek that Ms. Guille be ordered to pay a penalty pursuant to section 54(1)(c) of the Act. In their joint closing submissions, the Commission and the Complainant submit that a penalty of $7,500, similar to that in the Kyburz case would be appropriate.\n[141] Under section 54(1)(c) of the Act, the Tribunal may make an order that a respondent found to have violated s.13 of the Act pay a penalty of not more than $10,000.\n[142] Section 54(1.1) of the Act provides the elements that the Tribunal should take into consideration in ordering the payment of a penalty. The Tribunal must consider:\nthe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice; and the wilfulness or intent of the person who engaged in the discriminatory practice, any prior discriminatory practices that the person has engaged in and the person's ability to pay the penalty.\n[143] A review of the case law shows that the Tribunal has imposed the following penalties to respondents found to have been in breach of section 13 of the Act.\n1. Warman v. Tremaine, 2007 CHRT 2: $4,000\n[144] The Tribunal found in Tremaine that the respondent had himself posted numerous hate messages that were highly contemptuous and injurious. They portrayed members of the targeted groups as evil and criminal. They refered to Jews as parasites and vermin. They claimed that Blacks were inferior to Whites. They called for the expulsion of Jews, Blacks and non-whites from Canada. These messages are malicious, vicious and extreme in the violent nature of their overtone.\n[145] On the positive side for the respondent, the Tribunal noted that there was no information that he had engaged in any prior discriminatory practices before he started posting on the Stormfront website in 2004. Also, the Tribunal found the fact that for a period of about ten months, after he was served with the complaint, the respondent refrained from posting any messages and that at one point, even disavowed and repudiated all of his messages, should be taken into consideration when determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed.\n[146] In terms of the extent of the hate messages, the Tribunal found that the respondent had posted almost 1,900 messages on the Stormfront site, as of July 28, 2006. Since the Tribunal had not seen nor read all of these messages, the Tribunal could not, in all fairness to the respondent, conclude that they all contained hate messages of the nature of those put into evidence in this case. Consequently, the Tribunal could not come to the conclusion that the number of messages posted favoured a penalty at the highest end of the spectrum.\n[147] The Tribunal noted that the respondent's wilfulness and intent in engaging in the discriminatory practice, was self-evident from the vicious tone of the messages themselves. His reaffirmation at the hearing that he stood by all his postings, his refusal to utter any remorse and the fact that he has not shown any indication that he had any intent of stopping.\n[148] In Tremaine, the respondent gave evidence regarding his financial situation. He testified that he did not own a car or a house, that he had lost his job at the University of Saskatchewan. He testified that he was working 20 hours a week at a minimum wage job, clearing about $600 a month. This evidence went unchallenged and the respondent was not cross-examined on this matter neither by the Commission, nor by the Complainant. Taking into account the nature, circumstances, gravity and intentional nature of the communication, and taking all the other factors into consideration, the Tribunal found that a penalty of $4,000 would be reasonable in the circumstances.\n2. Warman v. Winniki, 2006 CHRT 20: $6,000\n[149] The Tribunal found that the messages posted by Mr. Winnicki were vicious and dehumanizing. The Tribunal expressed the view that there was evidence on the basis of the wording of the messages alone, that the respondent intended to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred and contempt and that he intended to convince people to think as he did.\n[150] The Tribunal noted that the respondent called for the forced expulsion of non-Caucasian people, he threatened violent action against the targets of his hatred and enthusiastically supported a racial holy war in which all non-Caucasian people will be destroyed. He made use of exceedingly gruesome photographic imagery to draw in his readers and to communicate his messages of hate all the more powerfully.\n[151] The Tribunal was of the view that the respondent clearly communicated his messages in willful disregard of the likely consequences of his conduct. He used the Internet, a medium that has a pervasive and powerful presence in society, to engage in this conduct. The Tribunal found that there was no evidence that the respondent had engaged in any prior discriminatory practices.\n[152] In Winnicki, the respondent chose not to testify in the present case. Therefore, the Tribunal had no indication of his ability to pay other than a posting in which he stated that he is reasonably well off, with a steady paying job, not much expenditures, all bills paid on time without much hassle. The Tribunal noted that it may well be that the respondent is no longer reasonably well off. However, in the absence of any evidence from the respondent, the Tribunal found that there was no reason to reduce the penalty on the basis of an inability to pay it. Taking all of these factors into account, the Tribunal ordered the respondent to pay a penalty in the amount of $6,000.\n3. Warman v. Kulbashian, 2006 CHRT 11: $1,000\n[153] In Kulbashian, the Commission and Mr. Warman did not establish that Mr. Kulbashian was involved in the drafting or editing of any of the Hate Message material found on the tri-cityskins.com website. For that matter, it was not proven that he contributed any of the Hate Messages that were found on the wpcect.com website or in the Vinland Voice newsletter, prior to Mr. Richardson's arrest. The Tribunal found, however, that Mr. Kulbashian contributed to the newsletter's content thereafter by drafting several messages, including the message that was directed against Mr. Warman personally.\n[154] On the other hand, all of the Hate Messages (including those on the tri-cityskins.com website) were caused to be communicated via the Internet through Mr. Kulbashian's direct involvement, as the provider of web hosting and related technical services. While his participation did not include drafting many of the Hate Messages, the Tribunal was persuaded that he caused all the Hate Messages to be communicated, and that he did so wilfully.\n[155] Mr. Kulbashian argued that his penalty should be reduced on account of his conduct, once informed of the nature of the material being posted. Thus, when Mr. Wilson's fellow police officer called Mr. Kulbashian to complain about the newsletter article that had named Mr. Wilson personally, Mr. Kulbashian had the reference removed from the website within hours.\n[156] The Tribunal noted that, in general, Mr. Kulbashian took issue with the fact that Mr. Wilson, Mr. Warman, and the Commission did not notify him of any objectionable material having been found on the website, before going ahead and laying criminal charges against him or filing the human rights complaint, as the case may be. Mr. Kulbashian contended that he was too busy to keep track of the material being posted on the Internet through his web server. He claimed that if a notice of complaint had been made to him about the Hate Messages, he would have had the material taken off the Internet as promptly as the Vinland Voice article about Mr. Wilson.\n[157] The Tribunal expressed the view that this argument, however, assumed a false naivet\u00e9 on Mr. Kulbashian's part. For the Tribunal, Mr. Kulbashian knew that a good number of clients were racialist. They shared the same post office box as his business, Affordable Space.com. He was a key member of the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team and acknowledged having designed the template for its website, wpcect.com. Moreover, Mr. Kulbashian wrote articles and commentary in its newsletter, the Vinland Voice. The name alone of this group should have alerted him to the possibility that the messages on the website may violate the Act. In addition, the Tribunal found that being a regular member of the Tri-City Skins, he likely was familiar with the organization's website and that he was so mindful of the likelihood of his clients' posting hateful messages that one of the reasons he opted to use a computer server situated outside Canada was to evade s. 13 of the Act.\n[158] The Tribunal was of the view that it lacked credulity, therefore, for Mr. Kulbashian to come before the Tribunal and feign ignorance of the nature of the material that was being communicated by way of his web hosting services. On the contrary, the Tribunal found that the above demonstrated that Mr. Kulbashian was aware of the content of the material, and consciously and deliberately enabled its dissemination. For the Tribunal, this constituted wilful conduct within the meaning of the Act.\n[159] With respect to the existence of prior discriminatory practices, while there was some mention in the evidence of a prior arrest for assault that was allegedly hate related, the Tribunal found that it had insufficient information from which to draw any conclusions.\n[160] The Tribunal indicated that the Commission did not lead any evidence regarding Mr. Kulbashian's ability to pay the penalty. The Tribunal noted that, in Warman v. Kyburz, the proposition that the burden may rest on a respondent to demonstrate his ability to pay the penalty seemed to have been accepted. In that case, however, the Tribunal took into account evidence that was unsworn and untested by cross-examination. The Tribunal noted that, in the present case, although Mr. Kulbashian did not testify, in the course of the hearing process, it emerged that he is a college student in his mid-20's who resides at his parents' home. He was raising a young child on his own.\n[161] While the available information is not conclusive, the Tribunal expressed the belief that Mr. Kulbashian's financial means were fairly limited, and that his ability to pay was accordingly restricted. Taking all of these factors into account, the Tribunal ordered Mr. Kulbashian to pay a penalty in the amount of $1,000.\n4. Warman v. Richardson, 2006 CHRT 11: $1,000\n[162] The Tribunal found that there was no evidence of any involvement by Mr. Richardson with respect to the tri-cityskins.com website. The Tribunal, however, determined that, up until his arrest, he was directly involved in the drafting, editing, and posting of the Hate Messages in the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's newsletter. The communication of these Hate Messages was obviously wilful. There is no evidence before the Tribunal of any prior discriminatory practices by him.\n[163] The Tribunal noted that no evidence was formally adduced with respect to Mr. Richardson's ability to pay a penalty but based on information that was gleaned during the hearing process, the Tribunal stated that it was persuaded that he was a person of very modest financial means. He indicated that he was on a fixed income due to an undisclosed disability. When the Tribunal considered conducting a portion of the hearing in Ottawa, Mr. Richardson made it clear that he lacked the resources to pay for his travel and accommodations. He required the assistance of a parent for transportation from the family's home in Hamilton to the hearing in Oakville. Having regard to all of the circumstances, the Tribunal ordered Mr. Richardson to pay a penalty of $1,000.\n5. Warman v. Harrison. 2006 CHRT 28: $1,000\n[164] Insofar as the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of his conduct, the Tribunal found that Mr. Harrison repeatedly communicated messages regarding persons who were non-Christian, non-Caucasian and non-English in origin that were nasty, vicious and extreme. These persons were laid open to ridicule, ill feelings, hostility and violence creating the right conditions for hatred or contempt against them. The Tribunal found that the messages were demeaning and disdainful. They served to dehumanize people belonging to the targeted groups. The use of racial slurs and degrading stereotypes were derogatory, insulting and offensive. The repeated call for violence against members of these groups denoted feelings of extreme ill will. Statements exhorting violence and death suggested that the victims lack any redeeming qualities, thereby dehumanizing them. These comments unquestionably exposed the members of these groups to hatred, contempt and real physical danger by suggesting that they were legitimate targets of indiscriminate violence. These messages served to develop and encourage envy, mistrust or resentment towards these individuals and groups, which in turn, breeds hatred against them.\n[165] The Tribunal also found that the messages clearly demonstrated that its author was being led by his ill-conceived views of society and his incapacity to accept others. The evidence clearly established that the respondent intended to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred and contempt and that he intended to convince people to think as he did. He clearly communicated his messages in wilful disregard of the likely consequences of his conduct. The Tribunal also took notice of the fact that the respondent had previously been found guilty of an assault on an individual which was racially motivated.\n[166] On the mitigating side, the Tribunal found that the messages put in evidence were posted in a relatively short period of time and that there seems to have been no new posting since 2004. The Tribunal also noted that the respondent was not responsible for the Websites; that he was but a participant to these various Websites. No evidence was introduced to show that there was a possibility of any recurrence of such postings by the respondent.\n[167] As for the respondent's ability to pay a penalty, the Tribunal stated that, as was indicated by the Tribunal in the Warman v. Kyburz case supra, the burden of proof relating to the ability to pay rests with the Respondent. Considering the decision of the respondent not to participate in the hearing and submit evidence, the Tribunal found that there was no evidence before the Tribunal suggesting that Mr. Harrison may have had limited resources.\n[168] Taking all of these factors into account, the Tribunal ordered the respondent to pay a penalty in the amount of $1,000. The order that the respondent pay this penalty was imposed essentially by reason of the violent nature of the postings.\n6. Warman v. Kouba, 2006 CHRT 50: $7,500\n[169] The Tribunal found that the numerous hate messages in this case that were communicated over a period of nearly three years were highly contemptuous and injurious. They portrayed members of the targeted groups as evil and criminal by nature. The especially troubling part about the respondent's messages is not just that they were profoundly bigoted; they also willfully and intentionally exhorted readers to share their negative experiences with members of the targeted groups with other Forum readers. In so doing, the respondent encouraged readers to participate in a campaign to convince the White world that members of the targeted groups are worthy of nothing but the highest degree of hatred and contempt.\n[170] For the Tribunal, this active promotion of hatred and contempt towards members of the targeted groups was fundamentally at odds with the goal of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which is to promote a society in which all are free from discrimination and all are worthy of equal opportunity regardless of personal traits such as race, national or ethnic origin, colour, and sexual orientation.\n[171] The Tribunal noted that there was, however, no information that the respondent had engaged in any prior discriminatory practices. Nevertheless, taking into account the nature, circumstances, gravity and intentional nature of the communication in the present case, the Tribunal found that the suggested penalty of $7,500 seemed appropriate and noted that the respondent did not provide the Tribunal with any indication of his ability to pay the suggested penalty of $7,500. Therefore, in the absence of any such information from the respondent, the Tribunal saw no reason to reduce the penalty and ordered the respondent to pay a penalty in the amount of $7,500.\n7. Warman v. Kyburz, 2003 CHRT 18: $7,500\n[172] Insofar as the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice are concerned, the Tribunal found that Mr. Kyburz repeatedly communicated messages regarding Jewish people that were nasty, vicious and extreme. Not only did these messages attribute numerous and varied criminal acts to people of the Jewish faith, described therein as innately corrupt and devious, but some messages went so far as to openly advocate the extermination of Jews root and branch as a class. The Tribunal noted that his weighed heavily in favour of the assessment of a significant penalty.\n[173] The Tribunal further found that Mr. Kyburz was responsible for the communications on the Patriots on Guard website. For the Tribunal, it was clear from the messages themselves that he communicated this information willfully, knowing that it was upsetting to many people. There was, however, no evidence before the Tribunal to suggest that Mr. Kyburz had been involved in any prior discriminatory practices, which serves as a mitigating factor.\n[174] The final consideration for the Tribunal was Mr. Kyburz' ability to pay a penalty. In this regard, the Tribunal noted that the only information that it had in relation to this issue was the unsworn assertion contained in one of Mr. Kyburz' web postings that he was impecunious. In this case, the Tribunal was of the view that there was some evidence before it, albeit evidence that is unsworn and untested by cross-examination, to suggest that Mr. Kyburz may have limited resources. Because of the way the evidence was adduced, the Tribunal did not feel that it could attribute it much weight, although it considered it. The Tribunal also stated having taken into account the fact that this was evidently a first offence for Mr. Kyburz. While the seriousness of the section 13 breach would otherwise call for a fine at or near the maximum permissible under the legislation, these factors have persuaded the Tribunal that a somewhat reduced penalty was appropriate. Having regard to all of the circumstances enunciated in subsection 54(1.1), the Tribunal ordered that Mr. Kyburz pay a penalty in the amount of $7,500.\n8. Warman v. Barr, 2006 CHRT 52: $5,000\n[175] Insofar as the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practices are concerned, the Tribunal found that Mr. Bahr repeatedly communicated or caused to be communicated, messages regarding Jewish people, homosexuals, the mentally disabled, blacks and other non-whites that were vicious and extreme in their characterization. The materials communicated expressed hatred and contempt in respect of members of these various groups and invited others to hold these persons in hatred and contempt. Some of the material considered in these reasons advocates for the extermination of Jewish people, homosexuals and persons suffering mental disabilities. The Tribunal was of the view that this weighed heavily in favour of the assessment of a significant penalty.\n[176] No evidence was led to suggest that the respondent had engaged in any prior discriminatory practices. The Tribunal took note of the fact that that the charges laid against Mr. Bahr under s. 319(2) of the Criminal Code arose from the same or substantially the same material as was considered in this proceeding, and not to prior separate discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal further found that the fact that the website was shut down by Mr. Bahr almost immediately after Sergeant Camp executed a search warrant at his apartment was a mitigating factor.\n[177] The Tribunal heard no direct evidence of the details of Mr. Bahr's financial circumstances. The Tribunal noted however, that s. 50(3) of the CHRA authorized the Tribunal to accept whatever evidence and other information that it sees fit, whether or not that evidence would be admissible in a court of law. Mr. Bahr, through his representative, made it clear that the costs of the hearing were onerous on this respondent. The Tribunal found that Mr. Bahr was an individual of modest means and that his ability to pay was restricted.\n[178] While the seriousness of the section 13 breach would otherwise call for a fine at or near the maximum permissible under the legislation, being $10,000, these factors persuaded the Tribunal that a somewhat reduced penalty was appropriate. The Tribunal ordered Mr. Bahr to pay a penalty in the amount of $5,000.\n9. Warman v. Beaumont, 2007 CHRT 49: $1,500\n[179] In Beaumont, the Tribunal found that most of the impugned messages were likely to expose a number of targeted groups to hatred or contempt. The Tribunal noted that Ms. Beaumont did not care what effect her messages would have on members of these groups or the community at large.\n[180] Compared to other hate messages that have come before the Tribunal in the past, the Tribunal found that Ms. Beaumont's did not have the same gravity. Thus, although her postings contained negative epithets with respect to a number of targeted groups, these terms were not used with the same frequency as in other cases. Ms. Beaumont did not engage in any vivid descriptions of violence against the targeted groups. Her messages were in the form of relatively short postings on the forum, for the most part. She did not create an entire website replete with or dedicated to the communication of hate messages, as has been seen in other cases.\n[181] The Tribunal noted that the Commission had pointed out that Ms. Beaumont had posted at least 1,000 or more messages on the Stormfront.org forum, beyond those that are in evidence in this case. Without viewing the other postings, however, the Tribunal stated that it could not assume that they would offend section 13 of the Act, that indeed, not every single one of the impugned messages filed in evidence was found to constitute hate messages within the meaning of the Act.\n[182] The Tribunal indicated that Ms. Beaumont testified that she had not been on Stormfront.org since July 2006, and that her EveryonesSpace.com and MySpace accounts had been deleted. However, the Complainant pointed out that after the human rights complaint was filed against her, she posted a number of the hate messages that were in evidence in this case.\n[183] The Tribunal further noted that Ms. Beaumont testified that whatever the Tribunal's decision in this matter, she would not change her views and ideas. However, she testified that she would stop going to the Internet if the Tribunal ordered her to do so.\n[184] The Tribunal found that, at the time of the hearing, Ms. Beaumont was no longer residing in British Columbia and had moved back to Calgary, that she was 21 years old and was living with her parents, that she claimed to be paying rent to her parents although this evidence was not documented, that she was employed as a salesperson in a retail store earning $10.50\/hour. The Tribunal further found that there was no evidence of her having engaged in any prior discriminatory practices. Taking all of these factors into account, the Tribunal ordered Ms. Beaumont to pay a penalty of $1,500.\n[185] Using the discretion conferred upon it by the Canadian Human Rights Act under section 54(1), after having carefully considered the case law and the different aggravating and mitigating factors that the Tribunal has to take into consideration with respect to the imposition of a penalty, the Tribunal will not order Ms. Guille to pay a penalty. This should not be seen in any way as the Tribunal condoning Ms. Guille's conduct as administrator of the Canadian Heritage Alliance website. Ms. Guille as well as the Canadian Heritage Alliance have without a doubt contravened section 13 of the Act. This said, it is worth mentioning here that the Canadian Human Rights Act is first and foremost remedial in nature and not punitive even if the Tribunal has under the Act the authority to impose a penalty.\n[186] Here, the evidence shows that only a few of Ms. Guille postings and not all of them were identified by the Complainant and the Commission as being potentially in breach of section 13 of the Act. The Tribunal notes that none of her postings called for the extermination, expulsion or killing of groups of people or ridiculed certain persons or events such as the Holocaust.\n[187] Now, the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that Ms. Guille was the webmaster who allowed material to be posted on the Canadian Heritage Alliance website and had the authority to remove the material. The evidence, however, indicates that Ms. Guille, as soon as she was informed that a posting or an article could be problematic, removed it from the Canadian Heritage Alliance website. The evidence also shows that Ms. Guille edited some of the articles and threads that the Complainant and the Commission alleged to be in contravention of section 13 of the Act. The evidence further indicates that there were forum rules and that, at least once, Ms. Guille reminded an individual of the rules and advised him that he could be banned if he did not comply with them. Furthermore, Ms. Guille testified that she did not condone violence and that she did not approve of death threats or any criminal conduct. All these elements put together lead the Tribunal to rule, as stated above, that, notwithstanding the fact that Ms. Guille, as site administrator of the Canadian Heritage Alliance website, has been found to be in breach of section 13 of the Act, the circumstances do not warrant the imposition, in this case, of a penalty.\n[188] This said, the Tribunal finds furthermore that Ms. Guille has limited financial resources and that imposing on her a penalty would, at this juncture in her life, put on her some undue hardship. Ms. Guille testified that she was an administrative secretary, that she worked 40 hours a week at an hourly rate of $14.00, that she received child support, in the amount of $325 a month, that she was not married, that her rent was $750 a month plus utilities and that she was raising a teenager all by herself.\n[189] In addition, there is no evidence before the Tribunal establishing that Ms. Guille has engaged in any prior discriminatory practices. The evidence furthers shows that when served with the complaint, Ms. Guille immediately removed from the Canadian Heritage Alliance website the material that was possibly in breach of section 13 of the Act.\n[190] The Tribunal is of the view that the interest of the public will be better served if the Tribunal issues a cease and desist order accompanied by an order requiring that Ms. Guille work with the Commission to redress the discriminatory practice identified by the Tribunal as provided by section 53(2)(a) of the Act. This should provide Ms. Guille with the guidance she stated she did not have with respect to what type of material potentially breaches section 13 of the Act.\nVI.

You need look no further that the severe brutality of the koran to see what a danger they pose to everyone. All of these bleeding heart Liberals need to wake up and realize they want to ahniallate (sic) western civilization. They consider all of us the great Satan, and rightly so.

I know my father would smack the taste out of my mouth and he's not racist he just knows its wrong.

Now I know that the parents of this chick grew up in italy because they were speaking the language. Italians never stood for this shit before no European would.

C-9\nThis document is entitled Homosexualiy and Traditional Marriage. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the whole posting, by Melissa Guille, which reads as follows:\nMelissa\nSadly, for the first time in our nation's history Massachusetts is honoring homosexuality by issuing marriage licenses to same-sex partners. The sanctitity of solemn marriage between a man and a woman has now been trampled upon by the far left liberal, glack-robe justices of the Masschusetts State Supreme Court.\nThe court's decision in this matter is a clear case of abusing society through judicial activism - judges legislating from the bench and overstepping their boundaries by interpreting the law in a manner to impose their own personal values upon society. The court's decision to grant marriage licenses to same sex couples is nothing more than open mockery against the laws of God and the American people as a whole. These legal marriages licenses are a counterfeit attempt to grant recognition to same-sex marriages on par with traditional marriages, and this violates the cornerstone of our society.\nHomosexual behavior is a perverse and unacceptable way of life that has been spurned down through the ages -the authority for that statement comes from God and not from man. Homosexuality is clearly and irrefutably condemned in the Bible, despite the attempts of maverick ministers and apostate church groups to grant it acceptance and respectability.\nThe rejection of homosexuality in Christian doctrine centers upon the behavior itself as a destructive force to the individual and a life style contrary to the well being of society. It does not call for punishment against the individual practicing it, but rather offers love and counseling (sic) to the offender with the objective of change. On the other hand, secularists have no hesitation in accepting the homosexual life style. To them, God and His laws are irrelevant and non-existent: moral equivalency is their tool of reasoning which eventually leads to condoning all behavior both good and evil under one mantle.\nYou can bet that our enemies within the nation of Islam are rejoicing over this latest step downwards by America into the pit of immoral conduct; they are always ready to use any example of immorality against us in their evil hate-filled minds. They refer to our culture as jaded and defiled, and there is possibly some truth to those claims.\nHR-1, Tab. C-10\nThe title of this document is Controversial T-shirt intrigues and offends.

It's DISGUSTING, And Sickens Me Greatly. We Should All Hope For The Day That A Virus Comes Out That Targets Traitors And Filth Only (Wishful Thinking eh?)\nHR-1, Tab. C-12\nThis article by Dr. William Pierce is entitled The Lessons of Africa. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record long excerpts of the article. Here are the most salient ones:\nWhite farmers are convinced that the attacks on them are more than a simple matter of crime. If the Blacks attacking their farms merely had robbery in mind, it would not be necessary to torture and kill their White victims. The Whites believe that the aim of the Black gangs is terrorism, and the note left at the scene of the Delafield murders supports their belief. The White farmers also note that the farmers who have been murdered were in many cases those who had been well known for their generosity to their Black workers. They suspect that the aim of the murderers is to drive the White farmers out of South Africa, and so the terrorists are striking preferentially at the Whites who have good relations with Blacks.\nBut many Blacks are more concerned with grabbing White wealth now than they are with the prosperity of the country later. In addition, the idea of forcing the Whites out appeals to many Blacks at an emotional level. Being dependent on the productivity of White farmers is galling to Blacks, and they are more inclined to kill the goose now that to continue collecting the golden eggs.\nAnd of course, the Blacks went about killing the Whites in a typically Black fashion, with lots of gang-raping and mutilation. White women had their breasts hacked off with machetes. Little White girls were literally raped to death by long lines of grinning Blacks while their parents were forced at gunpoint to watch. Little White boys had their bellies slit open and their entrails pulled out.\nThe South Africans betrayed the Rhodesians in 1976 in part because the Jews of South Africa always have had a strong influence on the South African government through their media control and their money. Harry Oppenheimer, with his vast holding in diamonds, gold and other minerals had more money with which to corrupt politicians than anyone else in South Africa. And the Jews, of course, were as implacably hostile to the Whites of Rhodesia as they have been to other Whites everywhere and at all times.\nThe second thing we should learn from the South African experience is that we cannot permit our mass media to remain in the hands of the Jews or in the hands of those under the influence of Jews. The foolish South Africans were manipulated, and it was the mass media more than anything else which manipulated them.\nAnd the third thing we must learn from the experience of Whites in Africa is that the only way for our people to survive and flourish is to live among our own kind. Multiracial societies do not work and cannot work. If we permit Whites to become a minority in America in the next century as the Clintonistas are planning, then we will suffer a fate similar to that of Whites everywhere else that they have let themselves become a minority. What we must do to avoid becoming a minority may be extraordinary hard, but we must do it to survive. The extinction of our people is the alternative.\nHR-1, Tab C-15\nThe article is entitled The Jewish Final Solution for Whites. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nHowever, this same group of people is seeking to destroy the racial feeling of its host population once and for all, through the means of encouraging racial mixing along with promoting the invasion of White homelands by swarms of fater-reproducing non-Whites. Racial mixing and numerical engulfment would result in the ethnic eradication of Whites, and their subsequent replacement with a mongrelize mixed-race mass.\nThus the problem of White racial pride, which historically has always been the bane of Jews, will succesfully be neutralized. This is the Jews' final solution for the historical problem of White racial feeling: dissolution of Whites by miscegenation and outnumbering by non-Whites. In other words, the problem of White pride is being solved once and for all by the genocide of Whites themselves.\nBy flooding White former homelands with non-Whites and effecting White miscegenation, the problem of White racial feeling will be effectively solved for all time by dissolution. Afterwards, presumably Jews can carry on their traditional position of dominance and contol of the society, but for the first time there will be no opposition, as the mongrelize population cannot assert racial pride, because by definition it can have none. Without a deep sense of racial pride, the mulatto population will not be able to oppose or overthrow Jewish rule.\nThe Jews have used their media and money power to label the natural and healthy racial instinct with all people as racism and has declared that specifically White racism is the root of nearly all evil in the world. This has resulted in White people feeling guilty for a natural urge within them, much like certain Christian sects made their adherrent feel guilty for the urge of sex.\nThe most dramatic success the Jews have achieved in the effort to make Whites feel guilty is the Holocaust tale.\nJews traditionally have always been looked upon as suspect in White societies and esthetically undesirable. Also, although many Jews today have obtained White genes such as blue eyes, there still exists the prominent Jewish prototype of dark hair, swarthy features, koalo eyes, and a large hooked nose. This made the Jew stand out among his host societies, especially in the Nordic countries of Northern Europe. Today, thousands of Jews each year pay to camouflage their own features to look like Aryans by surgically modifying their noses to the European standard of beauty.\nIn short, Jews have historically been distrusted, shunned, and marginalized in European civilization from the very beginning. It is likely that there exists an element of resentment and envy, if not revenge, in the Jewish effort to dissolve the White race.\nWhites who care about their race can reverse this trend. The first step is consciousness of its existence and the development of the will to survive against it - primarily through an organization strategy. ... Of paramount importance to success of this strategy is the availability of mass media in both its alternative and eventually its mainstream forms for the purposes of racializing, mobilizing, and unifying White people, and recruiting members into the organization and special units thereof.\nHR-1, Tab C-16\nThe title of the article is To the White Racist. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nWe are compelled to the long-term survival of our white race, even if most of the race itself seems disinterested. The population of the white race (NOT the population of so-called white nations, in which nearly all of the increase is due to brown-black and brown-yellow immugrunts) is currently DECREASING at about 1% per year. This means that in the year 2050, the world's population will be some 12 billion, but only 500 million will be mostly white in their genetic background, with even fewer pure white.\nHaving an abortion ( ) is, mostly better than having an unwanted child. Never getting pregnant no matter how much a sow's slut you may make of yourself is then ALWAYS better than being burdened in your young adulthood. As a result, there have been some 30 million abortions of WHITE infants in the U.S. since the procedure became legal and, oh-so-coincidentally, exactly 30 million non-whites have immigrated to the U.S. to take the places of these unborn ... by the colored undead. It was the pressure of ( ) humanitarians worldwide who foisted such an obscenity on the white nations, and then convinced them to praise one another for such utter self-destruction.\nHR-1, Tab C-17\nThe title of this article is The invisible Backpack. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nWhen the White people who created America provided for their descendants to have privilege in this land, it was an honorable attempt to provide a heritage to be passed on from one White generation to the next. Every one of the Founding Fathers, who spoke to the subject, declared that he wanted a one race society. None of them believed the races to be equal and non of them wanted a multiracial society where the different races were living side by side as equals. When America began, White privilege was absolute.\nIt is high time that we realize that unless we protect our privilege by all means necessary, it will evaporate. If we do not protect our borders from non-White invasion, and our birthright of honest and honorable privilege - ours by right of being the rightful heirs to this great nation our forefathers built for US and no others - we will find that we will no longer have either the privilege or even a place to live safely into the future. Our inheritance will be forfeited to other by default, because we chose to give it away withoug thought, or protest.\nThe Indians did not create this nation. They live on this same land for thousands of years and never crawled out of the stone age. The Black race did not create this nation. They were brought here as property, and serve the same role as machinery does today, performing tasks given them by those who planned and determined the direction taken by this country.\nHR-1, Tab C-18\nThe title of this article is Facing Racial Realities and was written by Kevin Alfred Strom. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages of this article:\nThe message I am about to give you is a warning to American. It was written by a non-White who actively supports and encourages the dispossession of White people; a man who, when asked about miscegenation, says he is all for it. Nevertheless, he is a rare man in America these days: he is man who states frankly what others are afraid to speak of or even think about. As such, we are lucky to hear from him. His truths are a warning to all White Americans. Heed his warning to the West:\nBy 2030 immigrants, their White spouses, and other minorities make up 70% of the U.S. population. By popular demand Federal law enforcement agencies go after any and all White people who resist us an d putthem away in concentration camps.\nBy 2050, Whites have become 15% of the U.S. population. The U.N. replaces the Federal government of America. Other Western nations are forced under U.N. monitoring to accept millions of African, Asian, and Middle Eastern citizens. The planet then becomes a game between Africans and Asians only. Guess who will win that game.\nWhite Americans have an average of 1.8 children per couple, and that number is declining. The number of couples is also declining as homosexuality and childlessness become ever more fashionable among Whites. At the same time, I predict 10% of Caucasians will marry non-Whites, while non-White immigrants continue to both come in increasing numbers and have more children per couple.\nIt's only a matter of time before U.S.A. stands for the United States of Asia.\nWe may never be able to defeat the West militarily, but we sure as hell can genetically.\nAmerican school children are already learning about the aboriginal First Nations - the Mongolians - who rightfully own this continent. They are now learning about the crimes of the European invaders and usurpers, and soon all American school children will learn of the ultimate destiny and purpose behind it all; the new United States of Asia.\nThe word racism has been turned into a synonym for evil. But racism only means having racial feelings - a feeling of kinship with your racial brothers and sisters, a feeling of understanding and belonging, a feeling of being part of a culture, a part of something bigger than ourselves.\nRacial feelings are inborn in us. They are good and natural. And it is one of this century's most horrible deceptions to paint them as somehow wrong. If you want to call our normal racial feelings racism, then so be it. We'll call those feelings racism.\nAs long as there are races there will be racism. It is inborn, has an evolutionary purpose and survival value, and is even present in non-human species. Racial feelings are about as likely to disappear as are sexual feelings.\nActually, racism is good and necessary for the continued branching off of new types of human beings from the existing stocks. Evolution, so far as we know, operates primarily by such branching, and racial feelings are an important part of what keeps the branches apart. At some point, homosapiens sapiens refused to breed with the sub-men around him.\nLiberals are very suggestible, and are really the victims, of, not the originators of, the race does not exist, but some races must be favored swindle. It is convenient to demonize and dehumanize people that you are going to commit genocide upon. And it is easier to commit genocide when you convince your henchmen that the victims really don't exist. That is what the White race does not exist con is really all about. It is a warrant for genocide.\nA far more important concept in the crossing of human races is regression to the mean. This means that even if you mate a Negro genius whit a White person the offspring are, on average, likely to exhibit Negroid characteristics more typical of the average Negro, and not necessarily of that particular Black genius, and this is even more true of succeeding generations.\nRegression to the mean in the case of interbreeding with Africans means regression to the African mean, with Asians to the Asian mean. Neither holds out promise of raising the level of the upper half or our bell curve - rather the opposite. The other races have mixed with Europeans, and everywhere the results are, to say the least, unimpressive. They have nothing to offer us.\nThe European race has all the diversity it needs for health and further evolutionary development. It is a moral and environmental crime of the highest order to destroy it by breaking down all its defenses against interbreeding.\nWhites should be allowed to re-erect their traditonal barriers against mating and social contact with non-Whites in order to preserve our kind. Anything else is genocide.\nAnd our race is threatened. Nowhere is our birthrate above replacement level. Everywhere our borders have been opened and the new elite teaches our children that intermarriage is good and desirable. Everywhere the new elite teaches our children that to defend our genetic heritage is the very definition of evil.\nThe end result, if trends continue, will be genocide. The end result will be death for the uniquely beautiful, intelligent, and creative people called by the name of the goddess Europa.\nHR-1, Tab C-19\nThe title of this article is Indians Being Given Special Status and the author is one Michele Gagnon. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages of the article.\nIndians Being Given Special Status. Who will make the racism stop?!\nCanada is entirely filled with peoples from all around the world, who've come here overtime to work hard and build a strong nation. Millions suffered great tragedy and loss and hard times, yet they've ALL managed to work in harmony, creating wealth and paying the taxman to uphold our nation's communities. ALL accept (sic, read except) the Canadian Aboriginal First Nations Indians.\nWhile we have contributed staggering sums of money and support to their race's communities and individuals, they have not done so for the rest of the peoples of Canada. A few Aboriginal first Nations Indians have used their free university educations (the ones the rest of us don't quality for) to get degrees in Law and argue, again on our tax dollars, that we still owe them billions, our children still owe them billions, and now they want ALL the land and resources.\nApparently only this one race can own Canada, and only this one race doesn't have to work or pay taxes for other races, and only this race can claim ownership of the land's resources and water-ways, and the funds they generate. Apparently only this race was troubled by change, and only this one race should be hightly compensate for it, by every other race out there. Apparently only this race is not to blame for any wrongs that came their way.\nIt's the biggest con game ever. We are paying them to blame us for things we personally did not do to them, and if we don't accept that blame and responsibility, WE are the racists. Their history reads better than most who's land was settle by new-comers, yet they've bilked us like we personally massacred them and are continuing to. What's more disturbing than this, is that we fell for that con job and allowed our fear of racism to generate theirs. But what did my Austrian grandmother do to their great-great grandfather that I would owe them so much money and so much of my own dignity? And how come only the white guys turned out to be bad in all the stories?\nWe cannot send babies back from where they came. This is the reality for Cnada in the here and now and it's time for the Canadian Aboriginal First Nations Indians to grow up spiritually and accept their fellow man with love instead of hate, greed, revenge, racism, blame, and a total lack of personal accountability. It's time to notice that innocent victims of this racism, live here, and work hard to pay taxes, only to be ridiculed by Matthew Coon Come and his propaganda. It's time for them to lay off us, and strart treating Canadian citizens with the respect and good will and reciprocation they deserve. Maybe it's even time for them to get jobs and pay taxes, but for sure it's time for them to get their hands out of my pockets, my children's pockets and my great-grandchildren's pockets.\nHR-1, Tab. C-20\nThis article is entitled Misplace Hate and was written by Erik the Norseman. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the whole article which reads:\nThere is an old saying Hate your enemy long enough and you will become your enemy. That, perhaps, should be amended to read, Hate your enemy as your are taught to perceive him and, in time, you will become that eneny, as you falsely believe he was, not necessarily as he truly is.\nThe Jews, by their actions, have proved this axiom. They have not only equaled the excesses, by their own propaganda, attributed to the SS and the Gestapo but by their treatment of the Palestinians and their Arab neighbours, have surpassed these excesses.\nFor millennia, the Jews have formed an exclsuvie, world wide, elitist society. In evey nation in which they reside, they remained, often for many generations, separate and apart, foreigners amongst those by whose side they lived. Naturally this resulted in resentment and animosity. Their loyalties were always to Israel, never to those amongst whom they dwelt or to the nation that gave them a home. Between themselves they gained virtual monopolies of many professions, power and wealth far out of proportion to their numbers. THEIR community (the Nation of Israel) transcended national boundaries and made national goverments tremble. It should be noted that the Nation of Israel encompasses the totality of all Jews worldwide and not just the state of Israel located in the Middle East.\nThe result was inevitable. Peoples and governments, throughout history, have taken steps to protect themselves from those whose loyalties they could not depend upon and whose power and wealth threatened them. The Jews labeled this understandable reaction opppression, discrimination and anti-Semitism. They portrayed themselves as the downtrodden whilst simultaneously bleeding dry the financial resources of their benefactors.\nOn the pretext of a two thousands year land claim, by acts or terrorism and guerilla warfare, they forcibly created the state of Israel. Now, today, the Jews, self-proclaimed chosen of God, have finally found some innocents to do unto as they falsely claim was done unto them. Read the News. Vengeance by proxy might be acceptable Zionist policy but not Christian\nHR-1, Tab. C-21\nThis article is entitled End of Times and its author is Carol on the Web. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nWhen whites complain of minority treatment, we are demonized, relegated to the margins of society as dangerous haters, accused of anti social bigotry and risks a certain professional and financial death sentence, should we persist. We are unable to communicate effectively with each other to plan our defense because most avenues of communication are shut off to us, controlled by interest disinclined to freedom of expression for any but approve orthodoxies. There is no such thing as polite discussion of the time table for the annihilation of the white race. Yet is WE who are the true minority on the planet.\nI have connected the dots between Jewish immigration to the U.S. and the cultural jihad they've launched against yet another host culture.\nThis time it's Euro Americans whose Christian mores, norms and financial markets are being redefined by a Jewish stranglehold on the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Cabinet, Judiciary, and media monopoly. The hitherto stealth operation is combined with a viciously amoral academic partnership between socialists and homosexuals, eager to diminish resistance to their agenda by teaching our children homo-eroticism as sexual equivalence. Christmas is no longer tolerated in schools, government, on calendars, or WWI monuments. Our children are asked to wrap and donate holiday presents for poor children by our local schools, yet we are cautioned not to use Christmas paper which is offensive. Offensive to whom? All those Buddhists and Muslims in our suburbs? Our latino neighbors? Blacks?\nHR-1, Tab. C-23\nThis is an article written by Christian Keptler which is entiled The New Order Crowd's Chosen Black. Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages of the article:\nBy the mid-60's the New World Order clan that works out of appointed positions in and arount the U.S. Government had already discovered Colin Powell, now both a Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and a Trilateral Commission (TC) member. He was articulate. He loved the establishment. He followed orders well. He made no waves. He was not from any of the academies; he was Black, in appearance at least. He had not done anything well before the Army, never having quite fit in anywhere else. His grades were merely average or below. Born in the South Bronx, Powel had no particular political view (except on race where he is as anti-Adamic as the typical Black in politics) - having no stable, steadfast views is something seen as a quality in prospective front men by the Insiders. He was thus trainable - and usable.\nAnd so, Colin Powell's swift rise to the head of the Joint Chiefs of U.S. military Staff began, after never having been a combat field general, after not having the rigorous historical military training received at West Point or any of the military academies. Other much more qualified Generals (White and Christian of course) were passed over like molded snacks on a party plate.\nThis is the type of person (aka President George Bush I) whom the Insider New World Order crew loves. Say yes and bow them and you can have the world.\nI, as the rest of you am used to Black pets getting promoted simply because they are able to get in front of a crowd without vomiting on them. But what I don't like about him is that he proudly displays a menorah behind his desk, because he says, It's a constant reminder to me of the suffering and persecution we've both been through. But there's a little more to this racial background, which has also helped him scoot up the insider ladder; besides being Black, he has a snake in his background, on his mother's side from Jamaica. Thus, the menorah means something more than just the idea of his and their race being persecuted; it's definitely racial and possibly religious because Powell has rejected Christianity.\nSo yes, Powell's brainwashed. Yes he's a yes-man and lackey for the one-worlders. Yes he's a poof of an empty shirt who'll follow along to get along. All those aspects of Powelll are typical of America's appointed class; but the menorah and hidden heritage turn him into just another sneaky snake.\nHR-1, Tab. C-24\nThis article is entitled Rosolute Peasanty - a Venerable Choice and was written by Carol on the Web. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nI am a card-carrying member of that post-depression-suburban-caste known as the upwardly mobile, but culturally degraded boomers. We were born to more choices than common sense. And our mobility hasn't necessarily been upward or inward - just outward. Too many of us are lost in a sea of value choices - a malice prepense of Jewish media.\nBut not before I share a recent example of #5 - Do write letters to newspapers and magazines. Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post explore the new anti-Semitism saying -\nThis time, however, jew hatred is more sophisticated. It is not a blanket hatred of Jews. Jews can be tolerated, even accepted, but they must know their place. Jews are fine so long as they are powerless, passive and picturesque. What is intolerable is Jewish assertiveness, the Jewish refusal to accept victimhood. And nothing so embodies that as the Jewish State.\nThis assertion is brazenly disingenuous. It's also a mockery of the good-hearthed people who have welcomed Jews into top positions of power in our cultures, businesses, and governments. Jews are certainly powerfull and aggressive - if not picturesque. It is WE the non-Jews, who must tolerate the Jew-as-victim, in all its profitable manifestations. Krauthammer continues ...\nWhat so offends Europeans is the armed Jews, the Jew who refuses to sustain seven suicide bombings in the seven days of Passover and strikes back. That Jew has been demonized in the European press as never before since, well .... Since the `30s. The liberal Italian daily La Stampa ran a cartoon of the baby Jesus, besieged by Israeli tanks, saying, Don't tell me they want to kill me again.\nThe Italian cartoons are no worse than anti-Arab barbs in the Jewish\/American press. The truth is that Jewish tanks level whole villages in pursuit of soldiers of the Resistance. Jews uproot ancient olive groves to rid themselves of Palestinian crops. Jewish soldiers defecate on emergency room floors after destroying medical equipment in non-Jewish hospitals. And it is a wholly owned Jewish press obsessing over Catholic pedophiles, even as they ignore mounting numbers of sex crimes by Rabbis (names not reproduced) to name just a few - Interested readers should read the entire link. It's long but EXTREMELY instructive on sexual predation by Rabbis. Krauthammer continues ...\nAgain. And this time the Christ-killers come in tanks. Just when Europe had reconciled itself to tolerance for the passive Jew - the Holocaust survivor who could be pitied, lionize, perhaps awarded the occasioanl literary prize - along comes the Jewish state, crude and vital and above all unwilling to apologize for its own existence.\nReconcilled itself to tolerance for the passive Jew? - There are passive Jews? And the occasional literary award? Charles is embarrassing himself at this point but seems oblivious to the titters heard round the world. EARTH TO CHARLES - Jews awarf Jews who award Jews for exemplary everything. But he did get something right. The Jewish state is CRUDE, and not vital to any, but others Jews. In closing, Charles tosses one more stink bomb at the Euros - this time, the dreaded froggies ...\nFor those of us who believe that Jews have far too much control over everything in our lives... I ask WHO ELSE qualifies?\nJews are totally out of control in American politics, publishing, academia, media, law, and medicine ... need I go on?\nEnough already - anti-Jewish sentiments are a product of Jewish domination, combined with the frustration of being labeled a bigot and a hater should we complain. Traditional anti-Semitism is about what Jews DO to obtain and defend disproportionate power over the populations they exploit. This is about power, its use and misuse - NOT religion - unless power IS their religion.\nHR-1, Tab. C-25\nThis article is entitled General Rules for Living Among Other People. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nGood examples of enemies that white nationalists encounter ofter are anti-racists - whether communist, liberal or Christian (or all three), members of Jewish groups, members of law enforcement, members of the media, officers of the court, and the like. These people all mean white nationalists harm; if you treat them like your friend, they will use you until they think there is advantage in discarding you. Friends of white nationalists include almost everyone else, and some of the above when they are not acting in an official capacity.\n2) You have moral obligations towards your friends; you have no moral obligations towards your ennemies.\nThe Jews actively subvert white nationalist organzations through the use of informer, false arrests, the spreading of lies about the nature and intentions of organization, the publication of false news, constant propagandizing, criminal acts of harassment, criminal acts of violence, and generally any measnns at their disposal. They feel no moral obligations towards those they consider to be their enemies. (They also feel no moral obligations towards those they see as their friends, except insofar as is practically necessary, but that is just a manifestation of their immoral nature.\nHR-1, Tab. C-26\nThis article is entitled Paging Doctor Sinister ... Please Report to theMaternity Ward! At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nSince the Renaissance the societies in all Western countries have become increasingly Jewish thanks to the relentless behind-the-scencs manipulations of the Masonic Hermetic Rosicrucian elite who incidentally, have always made up the establishment and aristocracy of Western nations, and who became willing flunkies to the Jews and their lunatic Talmudic Kabbalistic perfecting of the world dogma.\nOrthodox Medicine of today is nothing more than a twisted, bizarre, anti-human construction firmly rooted (in a dogmatic sense) in Jewish Kabbalism.\nHR-1, Tab. C-27\nThis article is entitled A Warning for Americans - A Message from a South African. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nToday, however, South Africa may be the grim model of the future Western world, for events in America reveals trends chillingly similar to those that destroyed our country.\nHR-1, Tab. C-28\nThis article is entitled The GI's Dream and the author is unknown. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nMy dad, born in 1913 (deceased 1981) fought agains Hitler in WWII. Now, years after his death, I have finally returned to embrace my heritage without shame or apology, and have come to understand the monstrous deceit inflicted upon my father, our family and our once beautiful white, gentile nation.\nThis it the way America was when my dad, along with 15 million mostly all-white American servicemen, went to fight against the Nazis, incurring the loss of 405, 399 dead and 671, 278 injured:\nwhites-only immigration policy whites-only naturalization policy whites and American-born blacks only were legally permitted to vote, while literacy requirements and discrimination effectively prevented most blacks from voting (Africans in Africa also could not vote) native-born American Chinese, Hispanics, or other non-whites were not allowed to vote (Chinese in China and Hispanics living in many Latin American nations couldn't vote either; neither could Mexican women in Mexico until 1953) segregated schools intermarriage forbidden by law whites-only residential zoning, segregated military, transportation, hotels, restaurants, bathrooms, water fountains,etc. Non-whites were not allowed to be policemen Prayer was required in schoool We publicity (sic) professed to be a Christian nation Anti-Semitism was forthright and socially acceptable President Gen. Eisenhower, our famous Nazi-fighter, was the same man who later authorized the army to implement Operation Wetback in 1954 which rounded up Mexicans and drove them back into Mexico.\nToday anyone who would dare suggest a return to these draconian policies would be called a Nazi. The question arises: if the America which practiced those policies was no different from the Nazis they were fighting against, then why the hell did we fight against them? Why were we trying to destroy people who were essentially like ourselves? In retrospect, it seems like we made a fatal mistake in destroying our own kind in order to save a wholly alien people who, in gratitude to their foolish Gentile saviors, are now doing to us what they did to the Germans.\nWhen you look at the Nazi goals, very few Amercians would have been put off by the vast majority of them. In fact, for the most part the average American would have agreed with what the Nazis believed. The methods the Nazis used were necessarily drastic, and that is where most disagreement would have been found.\nIf it is wrong to want a White America, then America is itself wrong for even existing. And you can bet those who are promoting the idea that diversity is wonderful, know full well that diversity is as un-American as it gets.\n( )\nHR-1, Tab. C-29\nThe article is entitled Apology To The Black Race From White People and is written by Arthur Kemp. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the whole article:\nWe apologize for giving you doctors and free medical care, as a result of which you have been able to survive plagues and catastrophes an grow in numbers;\nWe apologize for teaching you to read and write, and for building you thousands of schools which we have repaired after you vandalized them and burned them down. After all, if you could not read how could you have learned the words of Karl Marx, Mao Tse-tung, and others how taught you how evil we are and how oppressed you are?\nWe apologize for developing factories and highways and buildings that gave you employment;\nWe apologize for developing farms that to this day feed the bulk of Africa;\nWe apologize for providing you with warm clothing made of fabric instead of leaving you wearing the animal skins that you wore before our arrival;\nWe apologize for those among us who have established welfare organizations and have devoted their entire life towards making life richer and better for your people;\nWe apologize that we have built roads and railroad tracks between towns and cities which you now use every day without thinking; We apologize for paying the lion's share of taxation while spending less on ourselves than on you;\nWe apologize for giving you law and order and a strong central government that prevented your own warrior nations like the Zulu and the Matabele from slaughtering black people by the hundreds of thousands as they did year in and year out before we came;\nWe apologize for teaching you the English language which has opened to you the netire world of European thought, culture,and commerce;\nFor all these sins we humbly beg forgiveness, and if you will only accept our apology we will be happy to take back all of the above evil and horrible things we have done to you and return to our European homeland.\nHR-1, Tab. C-30\nThis article is entitled How Christianity Harms the Race and was written by Michael W. Masters. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages of this article:\nChristianity, which many believe to be the noblest moral system ever conceived, must now share blame for the dissolution of the West. A faith that once served as an anchor for Western civilization has become a source for the same self-flagellating guilt that typifies liberalism. Today, Christianity's public expression differs only cosmetically from Marxism in its attitudes toward economic redistribution, equality and racial integration.\nHow has Chirsitinaity sunk so low - and our people with it? The anwser is that it has subverted inbred trait of altruism that help family and tribe survive, and has transmuted those traits into agents of passivity and surrender. Christianity has universalized altruism, thus stripping us of our defense against multiracialism. Today's Christianity drives us to betray our own interests to whoever asks. At the consequences of their actions today.\nChristianity's divorce from racial consiousness was both sudden and recent. Only in the 20th century did secular humanism infiltrate virtually every mainline Christian organization. By the 1960s, organize Christianity was working hand in hand with organized Judaism to dismantle the South's self-protective wall of racial hierarchy. The universalist campaign continues to this day, with ordination of women and soon, one fears, homosexuals.\nOne finds national and presumably racial separatism in the New Testament as well... Acts 17:26 reads: He hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation.\nLike their atheist counterparts, Christian trend-setters preach what amounts to the dissolution of the white race. Christian Coalition founder, Pat Robertson, supports more immigration from south of the border because the newcomers are nominally Christian, support family values and are our king of voters.\nWith ministers preaching racial suicide, Christianity may now be more of a threat to our survival than liberalism.\nChristianity's flaws did not threaten us until technology and ideology made their consequences felt on a world-wide scale. Now, our moral code must renounce universalism and emphasize our own survival. Unless we adopt moral beliefs in keeping with the realities of today's demographics, we will not survive the mounting wave of Third World immigration, procreation and miscegenation. It is in this sense that, as Jean Raspail says, Christian charity will prove itself powerless, Christian charity can hardly stop a demographic displacement that it helped set in motion.\nHR-1, Tab. C-31\nThe article is entitled Does a Satanic Cult Rule the World? And is written by Henry Makow. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nWho is the Illuminati? We are still living off the twilight rays of Western Civilization, which was based on Christianity. Civilization is always based on a religion, an ideal. Christ taught that God is immanent and His Plan is to manifest Himself through His Creation. We must do His will rather than pursue our own selfish desires. Kings derived their authority from God and were answerable to Him.\nThe Jewish Pharisees rejected Christ. They practiced a naturalistic religion that turn Christ's message on its head.\nFreemasonry is taught to your child. For example, a survey of schools in my city shows that 75% no longer use the word Christmas to describe their holiday season festivities. Instead Christmas has been replaced with such jargon as winter concerts and international celebration of holidays.\nThe Christmas tree at the Legislature was renamed multicultural tree until a storm of protect force the politicians to relent.\nWe have to abandon our culture in order to respect everyone else's? It's kind of silly, one parent complained.\nBut this is exactly the agenda: To destroy Christianity, just as they have destroyed empires, nations, heterosexual identities and nuclear families. The agenda is to strip people power and identity leaving us defenceless in the face of one-world tyranny.\nHR-1, Tab. C-32\nThis article is entitled Spoiled Blacks:What we don't Dare to Discuss and is written by Robert Rocher. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages;\nGiven continuation of present trends, there will be another ice age before anyone of any race has brains or guts enough to stand up and say rampant irresponsible psychopathic deviance is a prominent characteristic of the black subculture that is chiefly responsible for the problems of the black race. And that anyone I'm speaking of includes what passes for religious leaders.\nParenthetically, if any group needs a women's liberation movement, it is black women. Calloused black dude psychopaths use them without conscience, get them pregnant, desert the women and the children, then laugh it off. Some of them, the street-cool dudes, even come back later to sell drugs to children they sire. Black women should rise up and just plain slaughter half of the black men in the country without mercy until there is a trace of Gangsta Rap music remaining in the world. Until they do, there will be little future for the black race. The reason they don't do it is because they aren't any more responsible than the men.\nHR-1, Tab.

At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nTo the people of Israel, who stand by the graves of the Jews I will kill:\nYou assassinate my freedom fighters while explaining to the world that you are merely defending your own squatters. Your shoot to kill little children who in defiance and courage wield small stones in the name of liberty against you, the fiercely armed enemy.\nYou occupy my land, and on my bloodstained hills station your tanks and armored jeeps in order to slaughter and mutilate little children playing in the streets.\nYou shoot out my water tanks and you kill off Palestinian policemen, even though at the time of your brutal massacres, these young men were patrolling their land or simply eating their last supper. You cut off my electricity so you can assassinate me more easily in the dank shadows of your dark treachery.\nYou want peace. Jews? You may have it if you wish. The price is simple. Get out. Get out of my land. Leave my people alone. This land is not yours. You stole it from us, and we are going to take it back if we have to kill every one of you who dares to remain and contaminate Palestine with your presence. You may butcher us and tyrannize us an murder us now, with your high-tech American weapons and your American money, but in the long term you have two choicies, and only two.\nGet out of Palestine, Jews. Or die here.\nHR-1, Tab. C-34A\nThis article is entitled Iraq: Proof Islam is a Nest of Vipers and is written by Erik the Norseman. At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nMuslims proclaim themselves obedient slaves of Allah and therefore morally and ethically superior. Honesty, charity and compassion are the LAW. We have recently seen with our own eyes their obedience to their God and his law.\nIn the early stages of the war, emergency relief supplies were sent into southern Iraq. The supplies wer mobbed. The strong took it all. Nothing was left for the weak - women, children and the elderly. A wonderful example to us all of the charity and compassion of Muslims.\nIn city after city, the move ruled. In Bagdad, as elsewhere, looting, arson, assault and even murder became commonplace.\nIf the above is a typical example of the Muslim's respect for their Prophet and their love of God, may God protect the rest of us from the devout Muslim.\nHR-1, Tab.

At the hearing, Mr. Warman read into the record the following passages:\nIt should not come as a surprise that when the dark races increase their numbers in Sweden, crime rises accordingly. This piece is written in order to provide an insight into how their behavior is universal. As I read through these statistics I am struck by a thought: whether a Negro is living in the Americas, where his ancestors were brought as slaves, or in Europe, where he is a privileged immigrant, or in Africa, where he has always been the majority, his behavior remains the same. The Jewish media would have us believe that oppression and racism force him to theft, murder and rape. Curious, then, that his behavior only becomes more destructive the more dominating his position is in society.\nFew dare tell the truth about the problems the dark races cause us, and those who do are treated in a way that can rightfully be described as persecution in several cases. In spite of this, however, the effects of the darkening of our society have not gone unnoticed. A majority of Swedes know what is happening, and are enraged by it.\nHR-1, Tab.

REMEDIES\nV. ORDER\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Ms. Dawson is an autistic person. On August 9, 2002, she filed a human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against the Respondent. This complaint was the second complaint filed by Ms. Dawson against the Respondent. The record shows that, with respect to her first complaint, a settlement between the Respondent and the Complainant was reached on August 16, 2001. The record also shows that the implementation of the settlement gave rise to a lot of aggravation on the part of Ms. Dawson who felt that the settlement was not being respected by the Respondent, that in fact it was being violated.\n[2] In her complaint, dated August 9, 2002, Ms. Dawson alleges that the Respondent discriminated against her on the basis of disability, in breach of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in that it failed to accommodate her disability (autism). Ms. Dawson further alleges that the Respondent subjected her to harassment on the basis of disability, contrary to section 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Finally, Ms. Dawson alleges that the Respondent retaliated against her for having filed a previous human rights complaint, contrary to section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[3] Section 7(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act states that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 14(c) of the Act states that it is a discriminatory practice in matters related to employment to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. As for section 14.1 of the Act, it states that it is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim. As for the prohibited grounds of discrimination, they are described in section 3 of the Act and are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n[4] At the hearing, Ms. Dawson represented herself without the help of legal counsel. The Commission was represented by legal counsel, and so was the Respondent.\n[5] At the outset, it must be noted that the Complainant, in her final submissions as well as throughout the hearing, was very critical about how the Tribunal dealt with her requests for accommodation during the hearing. The Complainant was of the view that the Tribunal was more inclined to accommodate non-autistic people's needs than her own needs.\n[6] For example, Ms. Dawson stated repeatedly at the beginning of the hearing that the hearing was not accessible to autistic people like her. She furthermore stated that she was not provided with the information she needed, nor was she provided with the answers she needed. She further asserted that the kind of schedule imposed on her, i.e. long lunch hours, long hours, did not meet her needs, that what she needed was a very fast concentrated day with short breaks, no lunch. In that respect, Ms. Dawson acknowledged that she had fairly big logistical problems. Ms. Dawson also stated that the Commission was largely adversarial in this case, that in fact, she did not have the co-operation of the Commission.\n[7] The Tribunal will refrain from judicially justifying the decisions that were made with respect to the conduct of the hearing and will let the record speak for itself. This said, in her final submissions, the Complainant asks that the identity of her treating physicians be kept confidential so as to protect her own privacy. The Tribunal sees no prejudice to any of the other parties in not mentioning the name of Ms. Dawson's treating physicians or the name of the psychologist who diagnosed her condition.\nII. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS [8] Before analysing the substantive issues that this complaint raises, there are a number of preliminary matters that need to be addressed. These are A. pasts events, B. Ms. Dawson's career at Canada Post and C. Ms. Dawson's medical condition.\nA. Past events [9] The Tribunal is of the view that it is important in order to understand the issues relevant to the present complaint to consider events that preceded the filing of this complaint. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that these events were covered by the first complaint filed by Ms. Dawson, which was the object of a settlement between the parties. These events, although not part of this complaint, were referred to and commented upon in the course of the hearing. They provide the background to the present complaint. However, they cannot in any way be determinative with respect to the findings made in relation to the events covered by the present complaint, events that occurred between September 2001 and June 2002. The Tribunal will consider firstly, the Cantin Report and secondly, the 2001 settlement.\n[10] Both Ms. Dawson and Ms. Daoust, a witness called by the Respondent, testified about these events. Ms. Daoust was, between November 1998 and November 2002, Health and Safety Manager at Canada Post and was in charge of managing work related accidents as well as the prevention of accidents.\n(i) The Cantin Report [11] At the hearing, Ms. Daoust explained to the Tribunal when and how she got involved with Ms. Dawson's case. In that respect, she testified that, in July 1999, she got a call from one of Ms. Dawson's supervisors, Mr. Schetagne, who informed her that some Pierrefonds postal workers (not management) had gone to management and had expressed concerns about seeing an employee coming to work with self-inflicted wounds and feared that one day they could be injured by that person. According to Ms. Daoust, these employees were wondering if this person represented a threat to their safety. Mr. Schetagne asked Ms. Daoust to send someone to the Pierrefonds postal station to speak to the employees and address their concerns. Ms. Dawson testified that this came as a surprise and a shock to her to know that colleagues would have thought that she could become violent and pose a threat to their safety.\n[12] Ms. Daoust testified that she then sent Ms. Johanne Cantin, who was director of the Employees' Assistance Program (EAP), to meet with the employees at the Pierrefonds postal station. Ms. Daoust stated that when she asked Ms. Cantin to go to the postal station, it was to reassure employees and not to conduct an investigation on Ms. Dawson. According to Ms. Daoust, Ms. Cantin met with the employees, wrote a report and handed her report to her in July 1999.\n[13] There is no need here to refer to the exact content of the report if not to say that it contained Ms. Cantin's observations and recommendations, that it was sent to a number of Canada Post people and that Ms. Dawson only became aware of the report at the end of 2000. Ms. Dawson's indicated in her testimony that the fact that so many people at Canada Post got a copy of the report negatively affected their views about her.\n[14] Ms. Daoust further testified that when she sent Ms. Cantin to the Pierrefonds postal station to investigate, she did not know who Ms. Dawson was and that Ms. Cantin had a professional relationship with Ms. Dawson. The evidence shows that Canada Post contracts with an outside organization to provide an EAP and that it is that organization which decides who is going to be the person who will respond to any request made by Canada Post. Ms. Daoust testified that Canada Post found out about Ms. Dawson's disability after the Cantin inquiry.\n[15] The evidence shows that the Cantin report was sent to Medisys, a firm which handles medical matter for the Respondent and also found its way into Ms. Dawson's administrative file at the Pierrefonds postal station. Given the content of Ms. Cantin's report, Ms. Daoust testified that she felt that the matter needed a follow-up. The decision was thus made to send a nurse, Madeleine Dufour, from Medisys to Ms. Dawson's workplace in order to provide reassurance to the postal station employees. Ms. Dawson testified that she was never made aware of this measure. Ms. Daoust testified that the Union was made aware as well as her chef d'unit\u00e9.\n[16] The additional steps taken by Canada Post revealed that Ms. Dawson did not represent any threat to her colleagues, that she had never injured herself in front of co-workers. Ms. Daoust testified that all those who received a copy of the Cantin report were told to disregard the report.\n[17] In her testimony, Ms. Dawson stated time and time again that she saw the initiative to send Ms. Cantin to the Pierrefonds postal station as an investigation on her after serious allegations had been made by colleagues in relation to her violent behavior.\n[18] Ms. Daoust testified that, when Ms. Dawson learned about the existence of the Cantin report, in November 2000, she was very angry that such an inquiry had been conducted without her knowledge, that she did not understand why such an inquiry had taken place as well as why the information contained in the report had circulated within Canada Post.\n[19] In the course of her cross-examination, Ms. Daoust testified that right after December 2000, Ms. Dawson would have called her between three to five times, maybe four. She was however not able to provide dates. According to Ms. Daoust, the calls were about the Cantin Report. Ms. Daoust testified that, in the first phone call, Ms. Dawson complained about the content of the report. Ms. Daoust stated that Ms. Dawson never mentioned to her that Ms. Cantin was her psychologist. Ms. Daoust recalled that Ms. Dawson asked her at the time to remove the letter from her file and to tell her co-workers that the content of the report was false. Ms. Daoust further testified that in one of the telephone conversations in relation to the Cantin report, a discussion took place about what Ms. Daoust would do if she was told that a person had a gun in the postal unit.\n[20] The record shows that, after Ms. Dawson discovered the existence of the Cantin report, Ms. Daoust drafted two apology letters.\n[21] The first letter, dated January 18, 2001, is in reference to the report produced by Ms. Cantin, Canada Post EAP Coordinator in July 1999. The record shows that this draft letter did not meet Ms. Dawson's expectations. In the letter, Ms. Daoust acknowledges that the report had found its way in Ms. Dawson's personal file, where it should never have been placed, that it was not of a disciplinary nature but a sum-up of Ms. Cantin's observations and a summary of facts that were reported to her by some of the employees of the Pierrefonds postal station. Ms. Daoust further writes in the draft letter that the report was written for management to better understand the situation and help inform colleagues adequately whenever necessary and assured Ms. Dawson that it would be destroyed immediately. Finally, Ms. Daoust states that, at the time of the report, Ms. Cantin made a more complete verbal report and informed Canada Post management that no one in her working area should ever feel concerned regarding their security at work.\n[22] The second draft letter, which is dated June 4, 2001 and was also rejected by Ms. Dawson, refers to a meeting held on February 7, 2001 with Ms. Dawson. The letter states that there were never any complaints regarding her work that were made and that her work was exemplary, that she had not engaged in a certain type of conduct, that she was not dangerous for other people and would not physically attack anyone.\n(ii) The 2001 settlement [23] The record shows that the first complaint filed by the Complainant against the Respondent was settled on August 16, 2001. The first complaint had to do with the Cantin Report. Under the terms of the settlement, the Respondent agreed to pay a certain amount of money to a charity and to apologize to Ms. Dawson.\n[24] In the course of her testimony, Ms. Dawson alluded many times to the problems she encountered with respect to the settlement of the first complaint and the way it was handled by Ms. Huguette Demers, Canada Post Director of Human Resources for the province of Qu\u00e9bec. The delay in paying the settlement money became very annoying to Ms. Dawson. What appears to have been especially annoying to Ms. Dawson was the fact that Ms. Demers told her that the settlement payment had been made when in fact it had not.\n[25] The evidence shows that Ms. Dawson was able to explain the settlement to her co-workers at a five-minute floor meeting on September 6, 2001. Ms. Dawson noted that the meeting came after the airing in February 2001 on Radio-Canada of a documentary featuring her. According to her testimony, 100 people attended this meeting. At the meeting, Ms. Dawson stated that she was autistic, informed those present of her human rights complaint which had just been settled and talked a bit about the human rights training done by Canada Post. More specifically, Ms. Dawson pointed out that discrimination against autistic people is not caused by autistic people, that the problem is not autism and that there is not one set of rights for people judged to be crazy and one for everybody else.\n[26] For her part, Ms. Daoust testified that, in 2001, after the settlement of the first complaint, meetings were held with Ms. Dawson. Ms. Daoust was present at two of these meeting which were held at the Pierrefonds postal station.\n[27] The record shows that a meeting was held on September 21, 2001. Richard Paradis, Danielle Daoust, Jacques Th\u00e9roux, Christian Potvin and Michel Couture were present at the meeting. Ms. Daoust stated that, at one point in the course of the meeting, Ms. Dawson told Richard Paradis to shut up and that he did not have the right to talk. Ms. Daoust, however, admitted that she did not recall the exact words that were used. Ms. Daoust further stated that she did not recall what was the purpose of the meeting and who had called the meeting.\n[28] Ms. Daoust nonetheless stated that at the meeting, the content of the apology letters, referred to above, was discussed. Ms. Daoust testified that it was Ms Dawson who had requested that a statement to the effect that she was not violent be put in the letter. Ms. Dawson stated, in her testimony, that she needed this to be written down in order to ensure her safety. It appears that Ms. Daoust, according to Ms. Dawson, did not want to acknowledge that the second letter was badly worded, especially the part where it is stated that in concluding, the management and your colleagues now know that although you suffer from an autism disorder, your condition represents no threat to the safety of others. Ms. Dawson further testified that, in the course of the meeting, she was told that if she had concerns about anything, she should speak to Richard Paradis.\n[29] It is worth noting here that Ms. Boucher, Manager of Human Rights at Canada Post, one of the Respondent's two witnesses, stated in her testimony that it was in the context of the application of the settlement of the first complaint that a person was assigned to answer Ms. Dawson's inquiries and that the decision was made to minimize the number of persons who had to deal with Ms. Dawson. According to the testimony of Ms. Boucher, that person was at first Richard Paradis and later Huguette Demers. This was done in order to better understand Ms. Dawson and resolve her concerns, it appears.\n[30] Ms. Daoust testified that, after the settlement of the first complaint, she received calls from Ms. Dawson who was still preoccupied by the settlement. According to Ms. Daoust, all the phone conversations lasted between 30 to 45 minutes. She explained that the reason why Ms. Dawson was phoning her was because she had made phone calls to her bosses and that they had not returned her calls. Ms. Daoust stated that during the phone calls, Ms. Dawson sometimes raised her voice, especially when she did not get the answer she wanted but that she never was insulting.\n[31] The record shows that it took an additional few months to completely resolve the settlement issue. In fact, it was not resolved until December 2001.\n[32] It is worth nothing here that in the course of her testimony, Ms. Daoust stated that, after July 1999, she had many phone call conversations initiated by Ms. Dawson. She admitted that she never took notes of these phone conversations. According to Ms. Daoust, these telephone conversations, which took place at the end of the day, lasted for very long periods of time, between half an hour and one hour. Ms. Daoust however acknowledged that some of them were shorter but most of them were probably around 30 minutes or more.\n[33] According to Ms. Daoust, Ms. Dawson talked endlessly and, at times, became very upset. Ms. Daoust testified that she was not the only one receiving phone calls from Ms. Dawson. Individuals such as Carman Lapointe-Young, Raymond Poirier, Huguette Demers, Richard Paradis and Louise Lefebvre all experienced this kind of situation that was not always easy to deal with. According to Ms. Daoust, the individuals Ms. Dawson called were forced to ultimately hang up on Ms. Dawson in order to cut short the conversation.\n[34] In relation to the phone calls, Ms. Daoust stated that she could not recall when Ms. Dawson started speaking to Ms. Traversy, Corporate Manager, Industrial Relations, and how many time she spoke with her. She, however, was able to recall that Ms. Traversy had called her and had told her that Ms. Dawson had called and that her enquiries should be dealt with locally and not at a national level. The record shows that Ms. Traversy became involved in Ms. Dawson's file in the course of the settlement of the first complaint which took place in the August 2001.\n[35] Ms. Dawson, according to Ms. Daoust, called her because she was concerned about losing her job because she had come to work injured, about being seen as a bad employee. According to Ms. Daoust, these telephone conversations would have taken place at the time when the restructuring of the Pierrefonds postal station took place which was, according to Ms. Dawson, in April 1999 and according to Ms. Daoust, in July 1999, notably in relation to her sorting case. Ms. Daoust was however unable to recollect precisely if these telephone conversations had taken place at the time of the restructuring or in December 2000 when Ms. Dawson got a copy of the Cantin Report.\n[36] In her testimony, Ms. Dawson strongly disputed the fact that she had started phoning Ms. Daoust in 1999. For her, this was pure fabrication. Ms. Dawson stated that she had been working at Canada Post since 1988 and found it incredible that she would have started calling Ms. Daoust after July 1999 for whatever reason.\n[37] Ms. Dawson testified that she only became aware of the existence of Ms. Daoust when she became aware of the Cantin report in November 2000. The record shows that Ms. Daoust wrote to Ms. Dawson on January 18, 2001 in reference to the Cantin report. Ms. Dawson further testified that she met Ms. Daoust for the first time on September 21, 2001 in the context of the settlement of her first complaint.\n[38] Asked by Ms. Dawson if it was possible that she might have started telephoning her after August 7, 2001, after the signing of the minutes of settlement, Ms. Daoust answered that everything was possible, that she did not have the dates. Asked by the Chair if it was to be understood that between 1999 and September 2001, she had many telephone calls from Ms. Dawson where the latter talked about problems she had at work, Ms. Daoust gave the following answer: Well, I'm under the impression that we did talk not too long after the investigation. Obviously, after the report was found (late 2000), there were increasing calls, increasing issues, but at such dates, like I said, Mrs. Dawson is very good at dates because she writes everything, she knows when, and this and that, I didn't take any notes.\n[39] The evidence shows that Ms. Daoust was not able to recall precisely when she started talking on the telephone with Ms. Dawson. Furthermore, given the time line of events, the testimony of Ms. Dawson as well as the testimony of Dr. M., infra, that autistic individuals are extraordinarily precise of the things they complain about, the Tribunal finds that in all probability Ms. Dawson started telephoning Ms. Daoust after she discovered the Cantin report, i.e. in November 2000.\n[40] The above events, i.e. the Cantin Report as well as the 2001 settlement, provide the background to Ms. Dawson's second complaint and provide valuable information for the understanding of the events that form part of Ms. Dawson's second complaint.\nB. Ms. Dawson's career at Canada Post [41] Ms. Dawson started her employment at Canada Post in December 1988 as a full-time letter carrier. Ms. Dawson stated in her testimony that she worked at Canada Post for 15 years, until she went on sick leave. Now, she says, she feels that she has sort of lost her work at Canada Post and that she is not inclined to go back. Ms. Dawson testified that she liked her job a lot and that it was very important to her.\n[42] Ms. Dawson stated in her testimony that she was a very good employee. She testified that she had a perfect work record at Canada Post: she did not take sick days, she did not do overtime on her route, she did not declare work accidents and she did not complain when her rights were violated, she never had disciplinary measures taken against her, even in a minor way, that she was doing everything that Canada Post considered that an employee should do. Nothing in the evidence shows otherwise. None of the witnesses called by Canada Post questioned her perfect work record at Canada Post, on the contrary.\n[43] For example, in the second draft letter written by Ms. Daoust, in relation to the first complaint and which was rejected by Ms. Dawson, it is clearly acknowledged by Canada Post that her work as a letter carrier was at the time exemplary and that no complaints had been received from customers. In the letter of apology that was posted on August 7, 2001 on the Pierrefonds' Postal Station Bulletin Board, Ms. Traversy, Corporate Manager, Industrial Relations at Canada Post, clearly acknowledges Canada Post's confidence in Ms. Dawson's capabilities and her commitment to high standards in her work. In the letter of apology, Canada Post also acknowledges that Ms. Dawson had never done anything wrong to merit any complaint either from management, colleagues or clients.\n[44] Ms. Dawson testified that a lot of people on her work floor did really nice things for her and that she would help them out. However, she stated in her testimony that she had problems with her supervisors, mainly Mr. Schetagne and Mr. Potvin. She referred to specific incidents in her testimony, one of them being the day where Mr. Potvin came up to her and said that she would not be getting the things she had asked for by way of accommodation and that he had thrown her rack out. Ms. Dawson also mentioned an incident with Mr. Schetagne where the latter grabbed her and pushed her or shoved her into his office.\n[45] Ms. Daoust testified that Canada Post tried to accommodate Ms. Dawson in many ways, that Canada Post, according to Ms. Daoust, bent or ignored the rules in order to accommodate Ms. Dawson. This was strongly contested by Ms. Dawson.\n[46] For example, in relation to the restructuring of the Pierrefonds postal station which, according to Ms. Dawson occurred in the spring of 1999, Ms. Daoust testified that Canada Post tried to change as little as possible Ms. Dawson's delivery route, given that Ms. Dawson was autistic, that any change to Ms. Dawson's delivery route entailed a lot for Ms. Dawson, that in the course of the restructuring of delivery routes at the Pierrefonds postal station, Ms. Dawson's route was not part of the bidding process so as to allow her to keep the bulk of her route and keep the changes at a minimum level.\n[47] According to Ms. Daoust, Ms. Dawson, by way of accommodation, was allowed to start her work before her colleagues, that she was allowed to pick up her mail before her other colleagues. Ms. Daoust also stated that Canada Post made some changes to the lighting system so as to accommodate Ms. Dawson's need or request to have less luminosity.\n[48] Ms. Daoust testified that she was told that Canada Post also allowed Ms. Dawson to keep the design of her sorting rack the way it was, even though it did not meet the national standards, that she was allowed to sort differently from everybody else. For Ms. Daoust, this was another accommodation provided by Canada Post.\n[49] Ms. Daoust further stated that she was told that the reason why Ms. Dawson's rack was changed was because she could not work well with existing norms. On the other hand, Ms. Daoust testified that letter carriers could make minor adjustments to the design of their rack. However, they were bound to respect the national standards. If a letter carrier was not pleased with the national standards, she testified, he\/she could appeal but otherwise, except for minor changes, he\/she would have to adapt himself\/herself to the rack design according to national norms. Grievances were settled through the collective agreement.\n[50] In her cross-examination of Ms. Daoust, Ms. Dawson put to Ms. Daoust the proposition that the reason why she was allowed to change her rack was because it was full of errors. Ms. Daoust's response was that it was the national norms that Ms. Dawson did not like and stated that she assumed that the reason why Ms. Dawson was allowed to have a special rack was because of her condition, otherwise she would not have been allowed to set up a rack the way she wanted. She would have had to follow the national norms.\n[51] Ms. Dawson strongly disputed the fact that the rack she was given was a good rack that met the national standards. Ms. Dawson stated in her testimony that Canada Post dismissed the concerns she had with the design of her rack offhand, did not consider them as legitimate concerns and considered the changes that were allowed done to accommodate her because of her condition. Ms. Dawson expressed the opinion that the changes that were brought to her rack might have had nothing to do with her condition but because the design of the rack was faulty or problematic.\n[52] Ms. Dawson further asserted in her testimony that accommodation became an issue when her diagnosis became known to Canada Post in 1999 and that before that time, from 1988, when she started working at Canada Post, to 1999, it had never been an issue. Ms. Dawson testified that she asked to be accommodated twice on the basis of her disability. These requests, she stated, had to do with flexibility in scheduling and taping conversations in a hostile environment. As for the other measures mentioned herein, they were, according to Ms. Dawson, not related to her condition. Other letter carriers, according to her, had asked for similar accommodations.\nC. Ms. Dawson's medical condition [53] Ms. Dawson testified that she was diagnosed, as being autistic, for the first time in the early 90's, both by M. T., who had a Ph.D. in psychology and was a researcher at Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec in Montr\u00e9al, and by Dr. K.\n[54] In a letter, dated April 9, 1999, addressed to Mr. Christian Potvin, Dr. T. states the following: `Autism is characterised by qualitative deficits in social interactions, qualitative difficulties in communication, an intense need for structure as well as certain behaviors that may be perceived as peculiar'. And he adds: `Due to this disorder, Ms. Dawson needs a highly structured and consistent environment to function well and will thus experience difficulties adjusting to changes in her work routines. Ms. Dawson is an intelligent woman who seems to have been able to cope and adapt to her environment to meet the special needs that her disability creates'. At the end of his letter, Dr. T. makes himself available to clarify any questions Canada Post may have regarding Autistic Disorder and that with Ms. Dawson's permission, he would also be happy to make himself available to discuss specifics about her case.\n[55] In a note written on April 7, 1999, addressed to whom it may concern, Dr. K. states that Michelle Dawson has been a patient of hers for many years, that Ms. Dawson is autistic and that to be able to continue to perform her duties to satisfaction, she requires flexibility in scheduling and work job areas.\n[56] The evidence shows that Mr. T.'s letter as well as Dr. K.'s note were received by the Health Services of Medisys, the outside firm that took care of medical matters involving Canada Post employees, on April 14, 1999. It must be noted here that Ms. Dawson testified that she believed that Canada Post became aware of her condition in April 1999.\n[57] The Tribunal finds that Canada Post was clearly made aware of Ms. Dawson's condition in April of 1999. For her part, Ms. Daoust testified that she became aware of Ms. Dawson's condition in July 1999 after receiving the Cantin report.\n[58] Ms. Dawson testified that after she disclosed her diagnosis to Canada Post, everything went wrong. Before that time, even though Ms. Dawson came to work with self-inflicted injuries, this did not seem to create any qualms or concerns with respect to Canada Post. Things started to change, she stated in her testimony, after some Pierrefonds employees felt threatened by Ms. Dawson and sent a letter to that effect to Ms. Daoust in July 1999.\n[59] The record shows however, that on September 6, 2001, Ms. Dawson was able to address close to 100 of her co-workers in the context of the settlement of her first human rights complaint as seen above. In her testimony, Ms. Dawson stated that after that day, she did not have problems with her co-workers. Even those few who still regarded her with some suspicion did not mock her. New people coming into the Post Office got accurate information about her and her colleagues made sure that the newcomers knew how to behave with respect to her. Colleagues of Ms. Dawson, it appears, went out of their way to apprise the new employees of Ms. Dawson's condition and that sometimes she might need to be treated differently than other employees. According to Ms. Dawson, the floor meeting had a dramatic effect on her colleagues. This 5 minute meeting was for Ms. Dawson a turning point in the way her co-workers saw her. The key to this turn around was, according to Ms. Dawson, the fact that her co-workers got accurate information about her and some notion of the consequences of their actions.\nIII. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS [60] The Complaint filed by Ms. Dawson raises a number of legal issues as well as a specific human rights issue.\n[61] In her testimony, Ms. Dawson stated that, through this complaint, she was attempting to get a decision that establishes that autistic people are human beings covered by the Canadian Human Rights Act and to find out whether the Canadian Human Rights Act considers autistic people to be human and therefore protects them.\n[62] As for the Commission, in its closing arguments, it submits that the issues that must be addressed by this Tribunal in relation to this complaint are:\nWhether the respondent failed to provide the complainant with a harassment free workplace by virtue of failing to respond in an appropriate fashion to her concerns and needs or by treating her in an intolerant and paternalistic manner and by not exercising all due diligence to ensure that the workplace was harassment free; Whether the respondent treated the complainant in an adverse differential manner by reason of her disability by failing to respond in an appropriate fashion to her concerns and needs or by treating her in an intolerant and paternalistic manner and by not exercising all due diligence to ensure that the workplace was harassment free; Whether the respondent treated the complainant in an adverse differential manner by reason of her disability by failing, in the face of a medically supported request, to accommodate the complainant's need to record interactions with management; Whether the employer retaliated against the complainant for having filed one or both of her two complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[63] The Tribunal will deal in turn with each of these issues, i.e. whether autistic people are human beings and are protected by the Canadian Human Rights Act, whether Ms. Dawson was discriminated against in the course of her employment, whether Canada Post retaliated against her for having filed a human rights complaint, as well as to whether or not she was harassed in her workplace.\nA. The relevant legal principles [64] A the outset, it important to set out the legal principles applicable to the adjudication of issues related to discrimination, retaliation and harassment made by the Complainant against the Respondent.\n(i) Discrimination [65] In human rights cases, as well as in civil cases, the complainant or the plaintiff bears the burden of proof and must prove the allegations he or she makes on a balance of probabilities. HE WHO ALLEGES MUST PROVE. (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd. (O'Malley), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536.\n[66] This said, in proceedings before Human Rights Tribunals, the complainant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination in order to have the burden of proof shift to the respondent who then has to provide a reasonable explanation which is not a mere pretext that will convince the Tribunal that, for example, the reason for treating a person the way it did was not motivated in any way by a prohibited ground of discrimination. As stated by Mr. Justice McIntyre in O'Malley, a prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favor in the absence of an answer from the respondent or, in other words, one where the evidence, if believed, and not satisfactorily explained by the respondent, will suffice for the complainant to succeed.\n[67] In Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [2005], F.C.J. No. 731, the O'Malley test was found to be the legal test of a prima facie case of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. According to Morris, it is a question of mixed fact and law whether the evidence adduced in any given case is sufficient to prove adverse differentiation on a prohibited ground, if believed and not satisfactorily explained by the respondent (Morris, par. 27).\n[68] The Tribunal shares the view expressed in Singh v. Canada (Statistics Canada), [1998] C.H.R.D., No. 7, at par. 197 that to support a finding that a prima facie case of discrimination has been established the complainant must do more than put forward sweeping assertions. Furthermore, as stated in Bobb, mere allegations that a conduct was discriminatory cannot be substituted for proof of facts (Bobb v. Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission), [2004] A.J. No. 117, par. 76. The Tribunal further shares the view that a tribunal should be reluctant to find discrimination on the basis of a prohibited ground where there is a reasonable alternative to the theory that the complainant incurred discrimination.\n[69] A belief, however strong, that someone is being discriminated against is not sufficient in law to give rise to an inference of discrimination or to establish a prima facie case of discrimination (Singh v. (Statistics Canada), [1998] C.H.R.D. No 7, par. 206). As stated in Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., [2005] CHRT 32, par. 40, there must be some evidence, i.e. material facts, that if believed, will make the existence of discrimination more likely than its non-existence given all the circumstances of the case.\n[70] Over the years, Human Rights Tribunals have recognized that direct evidence that discrimination was the motivating factor behind a decision or a behavior is rarely available to complainants, given that discrimination is not a practice which is usually displayed overtly. As stated in Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company, [1988] C.H.R.D. No 2, rarely can discrimination be proven by direct evidence.\n[71] Complainants alleging discrimination must thus more often than not rely on circumstantial evidence, notably the conduct of individuals or organizations whose conduct is at issue (Brooks v. Canada (Department of Fisheries and Oceans), 2006 F.C.J. No. 1569, par. 27). The criterion is whether the circumstantial evidence, if believed, tends to prove the allegation of discrimination.\n[72] In Brooks, this Tribunal stated, with respect to circumstantial evidence, that it is not enough if circumstantial evidence is consistent with an inference of discrimination. This merely establishes the possibility of discrimination, which is not enough to prove the case. The evidence must be inconsistent with other possibilities. (Brooks, par. 114).\n[73] This said, as stated in Wall v. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, (1997) C.H.R.D. 6, the standard of proof in discrimination cases remains the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities and that in cases of circumstantial evidence, the test is the following: an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (B.Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Carswell, 1987, p. 142).\n[74] Hence, in its determination as to whether or not an alleged conduct is discriminatory, the Tribunal must analyze and scrutinize carefully the conduct itself as well as the context in which it occurred, keeping in mind, as stated in Marinaki v. Canada (Human Resources Development), [2000] C.H.R.D No 2, that for a complaint to succeed, it is not necessary that discriminatory consideration be the sole reason for the actions in issue but that it is sufficient that the discrimination be a basis for a person's action (Marinaki, par. 191) and that the intent to discriminate is irrelevant to the determination of discrimination (Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission) v. Play it Again Sports Ltd, [2004] N.S.J. No 403, par. 37).\n(ii) Retaliation [75] The Canadian Human Rights Act, as it stands, considers retaliation or threats of retaliation only in relation to a complaint having been filed and a conduct which was in response to the complaint being filed (Witwicky v. Canadian National Railway, [2007] C.H.R.D. No. 28). The source of the retaliation must thus be the filing of a complaint and not, for example, an event which occurred prior to the filing of the complaint.\n[76] The law is clear. Section 14.1 of the Act only considers retaliation in relation to the filing of a complaint. Furthermore, as indicated by this Tribunal in Marinaki v. Canada (Human Resources Development, [2000] C.H.R.D. No 2, par. 224, section 14.1 of the Act came into force on June 30, 1998 with no retroactive effect being contemplated. To apply the new retaliation provision of the Act to acts occurring before the section came into force would be to attach new consequences to events that took place before the enactment. This would, according to the Tribunal, give the legislation retrospective effect, which is not generally permissible, and is not supported by the wording of the act.\n(iii) Harassment [77] The Canadian Human Rights Act does not define what constitutes harassment but the case law does. In Hill v. Air Canada, 2003 CHRT 9, this Tribunal stated that the gravamen of harassment lies in the creation of a hostile work environment, which violates the personal dignity of the complainant. In Marinaki v. Canada (Human Resources Development), [2002] C.H.R.D. No 2, this Tribunal examined the elements that should be taken into consideration when determining if there has been harassment under section 14 of the Act.\n[78] In Marinaki, the Tribunal expressed the view that victims of harassment need not prove that they suffered pecuniary losses, that for a behavior to amount to harassment, some element of repetition or persistence is usually required (Marinaki, par. 188-191). However, as stated in Bobb v. Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission), [2004] A.J. No 117, in certain circumstances, a single incident may be enough to create a hostile work environment. In those circumstances, the nature of a conduct should be calculated according to the inversely proportional rule: the more serious the conduct and its consequences are, the less repetition is necessary; conversely, the less severe the conduct, the more persistence will have to be demonstrated.\nB. The relevant allegations [79] Ms. Dawson feels very strongly that Canada Post has discriminated and retaliated against her as well as harassed her. Her hurt feelings go beyond specific events that took place at her workplace. They also encompass the manner in which Canada Post dealt with her concerns.\n[80] In her complaint form, Ms. Dawson underscores the fact that throughout the period of the complaint, whenever she had met or spoken with a member of the Respondent made a point of not only defending its employees, but of praising, commending and congratulating those who, according to her, had insulted, threatened and hurt her and had violated her human rights. She asserts that she has tried very hard to find out from the Respondent what she was doing wrong. The Respondent, she alleges, continues to refuse to tell her.\n[81] Ms. Dawson feels that Canada Post acted throughout on the belief that autistic people are unable to speak for themselves or make their own decisions, that only non-autistic experts, and not autistic people, know anything about autism, that autistic people are bizarre and difficult to manage. Ms. Dawson alleges in her complaint form that, in her workplace, she was treated as a non-person although her work record continued to be excellent. She states that she never approached a member of the management of the Pierrefonds post office directly for any reason, that she used intermediaries to prevent outbreaks of intolerance, threats and accusations by the Respondent, that her very determined effort to resolve this widespread and deeply rooted human rights problem which, she said, has been very exhausting for her, have collapsed because of bad faith on the part of management. She furthermore expresses the view that the worsening of her situation since she filed her original complaint has led her to believe that she is facing retaliation because of the earlier complaint.\n[82] Over and above these general allegations, Ms. Dawson as well as the Commission identified specific employees of the Respondent who, they alleged, discriminated and retaliated against Ms. Dawson and harassed her, as well as events where the Respondent, through the acts of certain employees, discriminated and retaliated against Ms. Dawson and harassed her.\n[83] The Tribunal will analyse in turn the allegations related to specific employees and certain events. However, before conducting such an analysis, the Tribunal will consider the question as to whether or not autistic people are persons and are protected by the Canadian Human Rights Act. The determination of this question should provide valuable information as to the condition of autistic people, notably Ms. Dawson.\n(i) Autistic individuals and the CHRA [84] On this issue, the Tribunal heard evidence from Dr. M. who was the only physician called as a witness as well as from Ms. Dawson. The Respondent did not call any expert.\na) The testimony of Ms. Dawson [85] At the hearing, there was an objection made by Counsel for the Respondent with respect to the ability of Ms. Dawson to speak to the issue of autism in general. The Tribunal ruled that, even though Ms. Dawson had not been qualified as an expert in autism, the fact that she was an autistic person made her particularly cognizant of all the issues surrounding autism and allowed her to speak to issues that were not limited to her own condition.\n1. Ms. Dawson's testimony on autism [86] Ms. Dawson testified that autism is a neurological disability and that people generally do not have a good understanding of this reality. Ms. Dawson stated repeatedly that autism was not a mental illness. For her, a mental illness has an onset, various treatments, and there is a return to the previous state to a greater or lesser degree. Both Ms. Dawson and Dr. M., as will be seen, pointed out that the notion of curing autism was nonsensical. Still many people want to cure autism.\n[87] Ms. Dawson pointed out in her testimony that autistic people are prevented from discussing autism whereas parents of autistic children are considered experts automatically in autism itself, not in being the parent of an autistic child, but on autism itself. According to Ms. Dawson, parents are inevitably and invariably consulted in policy-making decisions and rarely autistic people. As to the representation of autistic people in Canada, according to Ms. Dawson, autism associations do not represent autistic people. These associations or societies represent families of autistic individuals.\n[88] Ms. Dawson further testified that parents also run major private funding bodies, including Cure Autism Now, thus showing that their goals may be at odds with what science dictates, their goal being to have a world free of autistic people, thus a cure for autism even if this is scientifically impossible and, according to her, ethically very troubling.\n[89] In the course of her testimony, Ms. Dawson asked the question whether it was wrong to be autistic, whether autism was a disease that should be eradicated from the face of the world, whether or not autistic people should be treated so as to be cured of their disability. Why is autism, she asked, responded to the way it is? Why, she asked, with all the range of human behaviors that we accept, why is it that autism seems to fall outside of that?\n2. Ms. Dawson's testimony on autistic people [90] Ms. Dawson testified that autistic persons compared to non autistic people process information very differently, at a very basic profound level, really low level. According to her, cognitive processes in autism are very different, so is the way the cognitive processes work together. Ms. Dawson testified that the brain of autistic people works differently. Autistic people require different kinds of information. Ms. Dawson underscored the fact that there are kinds of information with which autistic people cannot work at all but, on the other hand, there are kinds of information that ordinary people cannot work with but autistic people can.\n[91] Ms. Dawson also mentioned that there are ways of communicating that make it possible for an autistic person to function and others that make it impossible. Autistic people will, according to Ms. Dawson, do what they are told to do. For her, there are not that many people easier to accommodate than autistic people, that it is very simple to accommodate autistic people.\n[92] Ms. Dawson stated, in her testimony, that autistic people, like herself, need to know what rules apply and, if they are not going to apply, they need to be told and not have the rules change day after day. She also mentioned that autistic people are often times assumed to badly behave and to be deliberately difficult.\n[93] According to Ms. Dawson, one of the worst things one can do to an autistic person is to claim that one has not said what he has said. According to her, this throws the autistic person into massive confusion because speaking is a gigantic effort to them.\n[94] In the course of her testimony, Ms. Dawson referred to the case of Charles-Antoine Blais, an autistic six year old child who was murdered in 1996 in Montr\u00e9al. She testified that this murder had a huge effect on her, especially the fact of finding out that everybody thought it was understandable to kill an autistic child.\n[95] In her testimony, Ms. Dawson also referred to people with Down Syndrome. She testified that Down Syndrome is in the same classification as autism. They are both developmental disorders or neuro-developmental disabilities. People with Down Syndrome have been included in society with all the assistance and accommodation they need, which does not seem to have been the case with autistic people. Ms. Dawson expressed the view that the rights of autistic people will never be established or defended.\n[96] According to Ms. Dawson, there are a lot of autistic people. She testified that the conservative prevalent figure is 60 per 10,000, which is 1 in 166. This would mean that there are 197, 000 autistic people in Canada. No documentary evidence was provided to support these figures, although Ms. Dawson mentioned the Census estimates for 2006 in support of her assertion. According to Ms. Dawson, of the 197, 000 autistic individuals, 150,000 would be adults and 47,000 would be children.\n3. Ms. Dawson's testimony about herself [97] In her testimony, Ms. Dawson spoke about her self-inflicted injuries. Ms. Dawson testified that, at the very worst, there was probably a week or two weeks where two weeks in a row, she would have something, that she would injure herself. She added, however, that this would be rare. According to her, she would self-injure about once a month and never more. She testified that for cuts, it would not be more than one small area affected and not more than one or two cuts, but they would be in the same place.\n[98] Ms. Dawson testified that, well before Canada Post knew she was autistic, she would show up at work with self-inflicted wounds, that she did not suddenly start showing up with obvious signs of self-injury in 1999. According to her, any time after 1990, she would have had at times signs of self-injury, sometimes more than at other times, sometimes with long gaps.\nb) The testimony of Dr. M [99] At the beginning of his testimony, Dr. M., who is a psychiatrist, was qualified by the Tribunal as an expert in autism. Dr. M. filed a report as well as three letters pertaining to Ms. Dawson's condition.\n[100] Dr. M. testified on the nature of autism, autistic individuals as well as on Ms. Dawson's condition. The credibility of Dr. M. as well as the accuracy of his statements and opinions was not challenged by the Respondent. The Tribunal finds Dr. M.'s testimony highly credible even if the evidence shows that in recent years, Ms. Dawson has worked with him and has co-authored scientific articles with Dr. M.\n1. Dr. M.'s testimony about autism [101] In his testimony, Dr. M. explained that autism is not a psychiatric disorder, that it is in fact a neuro-biological difference as opposed to a mental disability. Autism is an innate condition. It is not a condition that someone acquires.\n[102] Autism is characterized by the presence of a certain number of symptoms above a certain threshold. According to Dr. M., what is very special in autism is that, you may have extremely different levels of adaptation and of apparent intelligence, that the level of impairment that appears may be completely discrepant with the actual level of intelligence for autistic people. Dr. M. stated in his testimony that autism has a lot of unique features in the sense that it is a condition which clearly gives some cognitive advantages to those who have it.\n[103] For Dr. M., the idea of curing autism is meaningless. Violence is absolutely not a problem that is attached to autism. According to Dr. M., what characterizes autism is that the specific part of the brain which is in charge of social activities is broken in an autistic brain. According to Dr. M., self-injury is linked to autism.\n2. Dr. M.'s testimony about autistic people [104] Dr. M. testified that more than 90% of autistic individuals are of normal intelligence. According to Dr. M., autism without mental illness or deficiency is now acknowledged as representative of autistic people. For Dr. M., autistic people are vulnerable to the malice of their peers and that they are stigmatized in society. Autistic people are not violent by definition. However, Dr. M. stated that he was sure that most people are intimately convinced that most autistic individuals are violent, even if it is not true. In general, for him, non autistic people have a poor understanding of autistic people\n[105] In his testimony, Dr. M. stated that he spends a lot of clinical time verifying complaints made by autistic people and that he is always struck by the extraordinary preciseness of the things they complain about. He testified that lying is exceptional in autistic people, and also that exaggeration and the exploitation of one's handicap to gain certain benefits are foreign to autistic people.\n[106] According to Dr. M., complete arbitrariness or appearance of complete arbitrariness is something autistic people cannot cope with. Within predetermined set of rules, autistic people can be very good.\n[107] Dr. M. agreed with Ms. Dawson's statement that if an autistic person learns how to regulate reactions that he or she has by having, for example, a safe place to go to, that he or she is able to get away from a stressful situation, it is possible for an autistic person to deal with quite difficult events, even though they may provoke strong reactions. Dr. M. also agreed with the statement that if an autistic person knows that he or she can use their coping mechanisms in a stressful situation, it makes it much less likely and even takes away the possibility that they will get into difficulty. Autistic individuals will express their emotions differently than ordinary people, as well as their anxiety, according to Dr. M.\n[108] According to Dr. M., autistic individuals process information in a more precise way than non autistic individuals. Furthermore, according to Dr. M., autistic people do not archive information in the same way as non autistic people. Autistic people are at their best in working with information. They are extremely good, for the most educated, in science and law. In fact, according to Dr. M., the information processing of people with autism is superior to that of non autistic individuals in some conditions. However, individuals with autism are, in many respects of every day life, at a certain disadvantage. Dr. M. thus stated that autistic people live in fact in a world that is not made for them.\n[109] Dr. M. testified that autistic individuals have no problem with hierarchy as long as hierarchy is consistent and fair. Autistic individuals start to have problems with hierarchy when it is self-contradictory. Autistic people are not as rigid as one can think. They can adapt to a new situation as long as the rules are clear, as long as there is a consistent framework. In an environment where there are little or no rules, they will not perform well. According to Dr. M., autistic individuals will function better in a regulated environment. Dr. M. agreed with the proposition that so long as there is a consistent framework in place, even though there will be unexpected events, autistic people will be able to cope with these unexpected situations and do well.\n[110] Dr. M. testified that, while the ordinary person will become aggressive when anxious, autistic individuals will sometimes self-injure. This is especially the case, according to Dr. M., when an autistic person cannot understand a situation or cannot get an answer to a question. According to Dr. M., self-injury is the most extreme response to a psychological impasse that has no solution. It is a response to a disorganization of the world. It is the way for an autistic person to respond to negative situations whereas non autistic persons will show anger. Dr. M. stated in his testimony that he was aware of Ms. Dawson self-injury behavior. He had seen one of the wounds she had inflicted upon herself. For Dr. M., a self-inflicted injury is a sign of a deep psychological suffering.\n[111] According to Dr. M., autistic people will also have a self-injurious behavior when experiencing internal pain of physical or psychological displeasure. So, if an autistic person finds himself or herself in a situation where he or she cannot escape, or experiences a feeling of disorder, he or she may self-injure, such as biting one's arm or hand. Dr. M. added that it is very difficult for a non autistic person to understand this type of behavior.\n[112] Dr. M. furthermore expressed the view that autistic people very rarely become aggressive. Self-injury, according to Dr. M., is a phenomenon not well understood at a scientific level. It appears that self-injury may solve a certain situation at the psychological level.\n[113] According to Dr. M., autistic individuals are at their worse when they have to guess very quickly the good behavior in a certain situation. And they are at their best in processing sophisticated information and in doing logical work or action. Autistic people are very precise. Routine is important to them.\n[114] Dr. M. testified that, if one accepts a certain number of conventions, autistic individuals will be able to perform. Autistic people are different from non autistic people in that senses are different, colors are different, brain allocation is different, involvement of a certain function or of a certain brain region in a certain task is different.\n[115] Autistic people, according to Dr. M., have a misunderstanding of what other people want of them, they have the impression of not being correct, not being adequate, because they do things because they just need and want to do them. They realize that, when they do their spontaneous behavior, it creates drama around them. Dr. M. testified that, for autistic people, verbal abuse has a detrimental effect on them. Autistic people will prefer if they can withdraw themselves.\n[116] Dr. M. stated in his testimony that it is absolutely untrue or wrong to say that autistic people do not accept changing things or change and stated that all the autistic people he knows that succeed to be employed, the commentary that is made is that they are the best employees. According to Dr. M., if autistic people are employed according to their level of excellence, their impairment becomes a means of excellence. According to Dr. M., in the workplace, the informal nature of certain activities, such as coming into the premises, dressing up, breaks, jokes can present difficulties to the autistic person.\n[117] Dr. M. acknowledged that for autistic people, accommodation takes usually the form of behavioral changes and of one's interaction with autistic individuals. This said, according to Dr. M., society is not very tolerant to accommodate autistic people.\n[118] According to Dr. M., autistic individuals should be told in advance of what is expected from them and an agreement be reached in this regard. Dr. M. acknowledged that coming to this form of working relationship is sometimes difficult in a workplace. Dr. M. feels that there needs to be a form of initial contractual agreement or arrangement where all the expectations are clearly spelled out and agreed upon.\n[119] In cross-examination, Dr. M. stated, even though there are unexpected situations in the workplace, what needs to be done is not to limit these situations but to make them more foreseeable. Dr M. gave as an example a route change: what is important is that proper explanations be provided. According to Dr. M., the unknown raises more problems than the unexpected. Thus, with respect to an autistic person, one way of accommodating that person is to tell the person in advance the changes that one wants to implement and explain them so that the person will be able to prepare herself. Changes must be explicit and understandable.\n[120] In his testimony, Dr. M. stated that when somebody who is not aware of autism is confronted with an autistic person, that person will perceive the autistic person as rude or as manipulative. Dr. M. agreed that if autistic people behave differently in social situations, it may not have to do with the socialness (sic) of the situation but with the kind and amount of information involved.\n[121] In his testimony, Dr. M. acknowledged that if autistic people are simply assumed to not be behaving well, that accounts for a lot of the social difficulty that autistic people might experience. According to Dr. M., a lot of their apparent strangeness results from this kind of absence of reciprocity. For Dr. M., one can perfectly live in a very peaceful way close to an autistic person with a very small number of accommodations. Dr. M. testified furthermore that autistic persons sometimes need to withdraw for a certain amount of time and that they should be accommodated for that. Dr. M. acknowledged that a number of accommodations requested by autistic people are impossible to satisfy.\n[122] According to Dr. M., autistic people most of the time know what they have to do to take care. They also know what they have to avoid. According to Dr. M., autistic people have a social na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n3. Dr. M.'s testimony about Ms. Dawson [123] Dr. M. testified that he first came into contact with Ms. Dawson after seeing her on the television program Enjeux in 2001. At the hearing, Ms. Dawson stated that before the airing of Enjeux, she had tried to get into Dr. M.'s clinic but was unable to get past the reception. It appears from the evidence that Ms. Dawson went to see Dr. M. in April 2001. At that time, he diagnosed Ms. Dawson as being autistic. According to Dr. M., Ms. Dawson is considered as a very high functioning person.\n[124] Dr. M. testified that he wrote his first letter for her in 2002. The evidence shows that Ms. Dawson has been working with Dr. M. for a few years and that they had co-authored articles. Through his working relationship with Ms Dawson, Dr. M. stated in his testimony that Ms. Dawson said things as she thought they were, that she has good judgment and takes good decision. Dr. M. testified that he thought that the decisions that Ms. Dawson took at her work were good, the reason being that he had never seen Ms. Dawson take a decision that he really disapproved on a judgment basis. Dr. M. stated that this does not mean that Ms. Dawson can never be wrong.\n[125] According to Dr. M., Ms. Dawson has the ability to accept errors from another point of view than hers. He further testified that the two main difficulties related to Ms. Dawson are related with the feeling of emergency and the feeling of exhaustiveness. So, according to Dr. M., when Ms. Dawson wants something, usually it's here and now. Whereas non autistic individuals who are 98% convinced of something will do the thing, autistic people need 100%. This may create the feeling or impression that she is never satisfied, that she is never happy.\n[126] Dr. M. testified that as to questions about Ms. Dawson's accommodation and her functioning within the workplace, it was important for Ms. Dawson to be consulted. Asked why this was important, Dr. M. testified that it was because Ms. Dawson knows more than people who are not professionals in autism.\n[127] In his testimony, Dr. M. testified that he did not understand very well what was happening at Ms. Dawson's workplace and that he was not interested in Ms. Dawson's employment issue. In fact, given the bad ambiance that existed at Ms. Dawson workplace, Dr. M. was cautious in his assessment of Ms. Dawson, suspecting that Ms. Dawson might be looking for some form of possible gains. His main interest was in determining if Ms. Dawson was autistic or not.\n[128] Dr. M. testified that he was not precisely aware of the measures taken by Canada Post to accommodate Ms. Dawson. This said, the record shows that Dr. M. wrote two letters in which it is stated that Ms. Dawson is autistic and which provide information about her condition. By signing these letters, Dr. M. did not have a clear idea of what purpose it would serve or how it would be used by Ms. Dawson. According to Dr. M., these letters were of a general nature and in his mind, Ms. Dawson would in fact decide of what use she would make of them.\n[129] The record shows that the second letter refers to Ms. Dawson self-inflicted wounds. In his letter, Dr. M. restates that Ms. Dawson is autistic and refers to the fact that Ms. Dawson's psychological equilibrium is maintained through acts of self-injury performed at home, that it is a way for her to cope psychologically with intense emotional reactions and should not be seen as an expression of anger.\n[130] Dr. M. testified that Ms. Dawson had told him that the injury that she self-inflicted helped her psychologically. For Dr. M., Ms. Dawson had the habit of self-injuring. Dr. M. interpreted these acts of self-injury as a sign of major psychological suffering, a way for autistic individuals to cope with anxiety. He stated in his testimony that he personally saw one of the wounds that Ms. Dawson had inflicted upon herself and stated that the wound was impressive, and would have been impressive for her coworkers.\n[131] In his second letter, Dr. M. states that like all autistic people with high intelligence, Ms. Dawson is particularly vulnerable to malevolence of her peers and can show intense emotional reactions. For Ms. Dawson, certain unforeseen events may cause a form of psychological disorganisation, even chaos and confusion and generate an intense reaction which can take the form of self-inflicted wounds.\n[132] The Tribunal finds that the views expressed by both Ms. Dawson and Dr. M. about autism and autistic people provide the proper background for the analysis of the allegations of discrimination, harassment and retaliation made by Ms. Dawson in her complaint.\n[133] This said, there is no doubt for the Tribunal that autistic people are persons, that unfortunately they are not well accepted in society, that they are looked at often times as special creatures who are not part of society as a whole and that society would be better off without them. The Tribunal is further of the view that autistic people need to be better respected and protected in society. They need above all to be better understood and accepted. The testimony of both Ms. Dawson and Dr. M. should provide a better understanding of autism and autistic individuals.\n[134] Hence, the Tribunal is of the view that the Canadian Human Rights Act provides to autistic people the same protection as to non autistic people and that both are equal before and under the law.\n(ii) Allegations related to specific individuals [135] In her complaint form, Ms. Dawson refers to certain individuals who she alleges discriminated and retaliated against her as well as harassed her.\n[136] Ms. Dawson thus alleges in her complaint form that, as stated above, she had tried very hard to find out from the Respondent what she had been doing wrong and that, on May 27, 2002, she was reprimanded by Christian Potvin, Superintendent of the Pierrefonds post office, for even asking this question. Ms. Dawson further alleges that on May 24, 2002, Ms. Louise Lefebvre, of the Respondent's Operation sector in Montr\u00e9al, told her that the problem was not that she was doing anything wrong; the problem was that she was different. It must be noted here that neither Mr. Christian Potvin, nor Ms. Louise Lefebvre were called to testify.\n[137] Ms. Dawson further states in her complaint form that, on October 22, 2001, the Respondent's Ethics Officer, Carman Lapointe-Young told her that she was violent, that the problems in her workplace were entirely the result of her disability and that in the absence of her autism, there would be no problem. Ms. Dawson further states that, on October 24, 2002, Ms. Huguette Demers, Respondent's Director of Human Resources for Qu\u00e9bec, also stated her assumption that Ms. Dawson was violent, at a time when she had little information about her except that she was a person with a disability. Neither Ms. Huguette Demers nor Ms. Lapointe-Young was called to testify.\n[138] In her evidence, Ms. Dawson specifically referred to a phone conversation she had with Ms. Carman Lapointe-Young. According to Ms. Dawson, in the course of the telephone conversation, Ms. Lapointe-Young asserted that Ms. Dawson had committed violent acts involving bloodshed on her work floor and in front of co-workers, that she had mutilated herself in front of her co-workers. According to Ms. Dawson's testimony, Ms. Lapointe-Young stated that she assumed this to be true. Moreover, according to Ms. Dawson, Ms. Lapointe-Young said in the course of the phone conversation that the big problem was autism.\n[139] Furthermore, in her complaint form, Ms. Dawson refers to Mr. Raymond Poirier, Operation Manager for Qu\u00e9bec who, Ms. Dawson alleges, would have told her that she was denied the tape-recording accommodation measure because Canada Post did not like it as well as to Mr. Christian Potvin, Superintendent of the Pierrefonds Post Office who, Ms. Dawson alleges, reprimanded her, on May 27, 2002, for having asked what was she doing wrong, as well as Ms. Lefebvre, from the Respondent's Operation sector in Montr\u00e9al who, Ms. Dawson alleges, told her on May 24, 2002, that the problem with Ms. Dawson was not that she was doing anything wrong, but that she was different.\n[140] None of the persons identified in Ms. Dawson's complaint form were called to testify by the Respondent. The Tribunal is thus left with Ms. Dawson's testimony.\n[141] In its final submissions, for its part, the Commission referred to the conduct of a certain number of Canada Post employees which, the Commission alleges, constitutes discriminatory behavior on the part of the Respondent, i.e. Mr. Christian Potvin, one of Ms. Dawson's supervisor, Mr. Richard Paradis, a manager in charge of Labour Relations at Canada Post, Ms. Huguette Demers, Director, Human Resources for Qu\u00e9bec, as well Ms. Carman Lapointe-Young, Canada Post's Corporate Ethics Officer.\n[142] Given the evidence and the nature of the allegations made by Ms. Dawson, the Tribunal will only deal with the allegation pertaining to Ms. Lapointe-Young. As for the allegation pertaining to Ms. Demers, the allegation refers to an event which occurred in October 2002. This event falls outside the scope of the complaint - September 2001 to June 2002 - and the Tribunal will not consider it.\n[143] The Tribunal finds Ms. Dawson to be a credible witness. The Tribunal notes here that in his testimony, Dr. M. stated that lying is exceptional in autistic people and that exaggeration and the exploitation of one's handicap to gain certain benefits are foreign to autistic people.\n[144] This said, the record shows that no evidence was called by the Respondent to contradict Ms. Dawson with respect to the remarks that Ms. Lapointe-Young would have made in the course of a telephone conversation with Ms. Dawson on October 22, 2001, an event which was clearly identified in the complaint form as potentially discriminatory.\n[145] The Tribunal finds that the remarks to be discriminatory in that they brand Ms. Dawson as a violent person in relation to her disability, a perception which is totally, given the evidence, gratuitous. The Tribunal thus finds that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to the comments that Ms. Dawson alleges were made in relation to her condition by Ms. Lapointe-Young and further finds that these allegations meet the O'Malley test, i.e. allegations made which, if believed, are complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favor in the absence of an answer from the respondent. No such reasonable explanation was provided by the Respondent.\n[146] Hence, the Tribunal rules that Ms. Dawson has established on a balance of probabilities that she was discriminated against because of her disability, in contravention of section 7 of the Act. There is nothing in the evidence that establishes, however, that Ms. Lapointe-Young's conduct constitutes harassment or retaliation.\n(iii) Allegations related to specific incidents [147] In her complaint form, Ms. Dawson makes reference to specific and clearly defined incidents in relation to which, according to Ms. Dawson, a breach of sections 7, 14 and 14.1 of the Act occurred. These are: 1. Ms. Dawson's medical file, 2. the Ottawa meeting, 3. Ms. Dawson's work related injury, 4. the Respondent's refusal to have her tape-record conversations. The Tribunal will analyse these incidents in turn.\na) Ms. Dawson's medical file [148] Ms. Dawson asserts in her complaint form that the Respondent's medical file on her case which, she alleges, she gained access to in October 2001, after repeated denials of its existence by the Respondent, is grossly biased, is an inaccurate account of extreme interventions and constitutes harassment against her. Ms. Dawson furthermore asserts that the Respondent's behavior towards her, as documented by its own file, is discriminatory and demonstrably based on the Respondent's equating her disability with being a dirty, crazy, dangerous menace.\n[149] At the hearing, Ms. Dawson, for reasons related to the protection of her privacy, decided not to put her medical file in evidence. Indeed, the record shows that Ms. Dawson, throughout her testimony, was reluctant to make available to the other parties and the Tribunal documents of a private nature, especially her medical record, given the bad experience, she alleges, she had had in the past at Canada Post where she felt betrayed by the actions of third parties.\n[150] The Tribunal is thus not in a position to assess the content of Ms. Dawson' medical file and make a determination as to whether or not the content is discriminatory. The Tribunal finds that the Complainant has not made a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to her medical file.\nb) The Ottawa meeting [151] In her complaint form, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent paid her former psychologist, Ms. Nathalie Poirier, to make a presentation to its national level officials (including legal counsel, Ethics Officer and Human Resources Manager), as well as executives of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) on January 14, 2002 on autism. Ms Dawson asserts that no autistic people were consulted or invited to attend or even spoken about this. Ms. Dawson further asserts in her complaint form that Dr. Poirier stated that she did not know her (though she was her treating psychologist for some time) and gave such a relentlessly negative picture of autistic people at this presentation that when one participant asked if there was anything good about autistic people, she said no.\n[152] With respect to the hiring of Ms. Poirier, the Tribunal heard testimony from Ms. Shirley Boucher, Manager of Human Rights at Canada Post, Mr. Lafleur, a union official, Ms. Daoust, as well as Ms. Dawson. Ms. Boucher and Ms. Daoust provided evidence as to the circumstances that led to the hiring of Ms. Poirier. Mr. Lafleur gave evidence about the meeting itself. Ms. Dawson testified as to the impact that the meeting had on her.\n[153] Ms. Boucher testified that she was, up to September 2001, Manager of Employment Equity at Canada Post and that shortly thereafter was appointed Manager of Human Rights. Ms. Boucher worked out of Ottawa. At the time, Ms. Huguette Demers was Director of Human Resources, for the region of Montr\u00e9al. Ms. Boucher testified that, after her appointment, she received a phone call from Ms. Dawson about her original complaint, more specifically about the settlement of the complaint.\n[154] Ms. Boucher testified that she spoke to Ms. Dawson on the phone about the settlement of the complaint, specifically the problem related to the issuance of the cheque to the non-profit organisation she had identified, several times, four, five or maybe more, she stated. These conversations took place between September 2001 and December 2001. Ms. Boucher testified that these conversations were long conversations.\n[155] Ms. Boucher testified that Ms. Dawson also called other people within Canada Post, identifying the President's Office, Ms. Carman Lapointe-Young, the Director General responsible for ethics, and Mary Traversy, Corporate Manager, Industrial Relations.\n[156] Ms. Boucher further stated in her testimony that people would call her after they had received a call from Ms. Dawson who were quite stressed because they felt, she testified, that Ms. Dawson was upset and they wanted to ensure that they had not upset her. She added that the conversation was long and that people were having difficulty communicating and closing the conversation. Ms. Boucher further testified that she herself felt that she needed to go and get help from an expert to speak to the management who was having difficulty with Ms. Dawson and to provide them with information and guidance about autism and how to better communicate.\n[157] Ms. Boucher testified that the decision was made, at the time, to have all of Ms. Dawson's calls handled by one person, Mr. Richard Paradis, who was replacing Ms. Demers, Director of Human Resources, at the time. The record shows and the Tribunal finds that all of these phone calls were related to the first complaint and its settlement. Later in her testimony, Ms. Boucher stated that after the January 14, 2002 meeting in Ottawa, Canada Post management did not get many phone calls, to her knowledge, directly from Ms. Dawson.\n[158] In her testimony, Ms. Boucher stated that she was the one who initiated the search for an expert on autism who could give sessions, dealing basically with communication issues and general information with respect to autism.\n[159] Ms. Boucher testified that, at one point, she received a call from Ms. Dawson who was quite upset because she had learned that Canada Post wanted to hire this individual who had a child who was autistic to provide information on autism to management and not a specialist.\n[160] Ms. Dawson's concerns about the hiring of an expert are clearly expressed in a letter she wrote to Ms. Mary Traversy, on November 12, 2001. In her letter, Ms. Dawson refers to the fact that Ms. Boucher also hired a consultant to find an autism expert who she knew and was a meteorologist. She goes on to say that what she wrote in her June 18, 2001 letter to Andr\u00e9 Ouellet: Educating management in autism - something she didn't ask for - had frightening consequences, including the EAP Director's letter. She expresses the view that having an expert come in seemed to confirm that autism was the problem, absolving management of their failure to apply, to her as to everyone else, existing standards and procedures, or even a modicum of decency and competence.\n[161] The record shows that, after Ms. Dawson's phone call, Mrs. Boucher contacted l'Int\u00e9grale in Montr\u00e9al in order to get a bilingual person able to speak about autism and that, in early December 2001, she was given the name of Ms. Nathalie Poirier. It was intended that Ms. Poirier provide help to the people in Ottawa as well Montr\u00e9al. The meeting was scheduled to take place on January 14, 2002.\n[162] The record shows, however, that an initial meeting took place in Montr\u00e9al with Ms. Poirier before the January 14, 2002. Ms. Daoust testified that the meeting was organised by Ms. Demers, Director of Human Resources. Ms. Daoust, who attended the Montr\u00e9al meeting, testified that were in attendance at the Montr\u00e9al meeting all the managers in Human Resources but that there were no union member present. It appears from Ms. Boucher's testimony that the purpose of the meeting was to determine if Ms. Poirier was the right specialist. Ms. Boucher stated in her testimony that Ms. Demers called her back to inform her that Ms. Poirier was a suitable specialist.\n[163] According to Ms. Daoust what was said at the meeting was that Canada Post had to deal with an autistic person, that they were not well equipped to do that, that they did not understand how to deal with the person. People were able to ask questions, according to Ms. Daoust, and Ms. Poirier explained to them how an autistic person functions and provided advice as to how to deal with Ms. Dawson, like hanging the phone if Ms. Dawson kept talking too much. According to Ms. Daoust, when Ms. Poirier came for the first time at Canada Post, she was not aware that the person in question was Ms. Dawson. However, according to Ms. Daoust, in the course of the meeting, Ms. Dawson's name came up and Ms. Poirier stated that she had already came across her file and that she knew Ms. Dawson very well.\n[164] Ms. Boucher testified, with respect to the meeting that was to be held in Ottawa, that those who would be invited to attend the meeting would be people who currently were getting the most communication, who were having difficulty communicating with Ms. Dawson. Ms. Boucher testified that initially only management was supposed to be invited and that, after a impromptu meeting with a union representative, the decision was made to invite union representatives. Ms. Boucher further stated in her testimony that Mr. Lafleur called her a few days before the meeting that was scheduled to be held in Ottawa, asking for a copy of Ms. Poirier's c.v. which she sent him. Mr. Lafleur testified that it was not unusual for Canada Post to organise meetings where human rights issues were discussed.\n[165] The record shows that on January 14, 2002, a meeting was held in Ottawa with Canadian Union Postal Workers representatives (national, regional and local levels), Canada Post officials and Ms. Nathalie Poirier. The record shows that amongst the attendees at the January 14, 2002 meeting were Mr. Lafleur, a union official, seven or eight people from Canada Post Employee Assistance Program, Huguette Demers, from Canada Post, as well as seven or eight other Canada Post people. According to Mr. Lafleur, the purpose of the meeting was for Canada Post to get more education on autism, get a better understanding of what autism was and what the implications were as well as to move Ms. Dawson's file forward.\n[166] In her testimony, Ms. Boucher stated that the organisers of the meeting were mindful of the need not to discuss an individual case and to have a general session. Mr. Lafleur testified that, during the meeting per se, there were no discussions about Ms. Dawson and Ms. Dawson' situation at Canada Post. Ms. Boucher acknowledged however, under cross-examination, that the meeting was about how to better communicate with Ms. Dawson. Ms. Boucher further acknowledged that the meeting was not successful in achieving that goal.\n[167] It appears from Mr. Lafleur's testimony that the union had tried on many occasions to have Ms. Dawson present at the meeting, but to no avail. Finally, the union and Canada Post agreed to have a meeting in Ottawa without Ms. Dawson present. Ms. Dawson was thus not invited at the January 14, 2002 meeting in Ottawa. Mr. Lafleur stated that he felt that it would be preferable if the interested parties were invited to these information sessions but that this was not usually the case.\n[168] The record shows that Ms. Poirier gave handouts of her presentations to the attendees. Mr. Lafleur testified that he was taken aback by what was said by Ms. Poirier on autism. According to Mr. Lafleur, Ms. Poirier's comments were to the effect that autistic people were selfish and did not have any feelings. Mr. Lafleur was never contradicted on this. For her part, Ms. Boucher testified that there was, according to her, good information in the presentation, that it gave the attendees a little bit more information on autism. When one looks at the handout provided to the participants by Ms. Poirier, the content puts a lot more emphasis on the negative traits of autism than on the positive ones.\n[169] The record shows that on January 15, 2002, Mr. Lafleur wrote a letter to Ms. Mary Traversy, Manager, Industrial Relations, after it was discovered that Ms. Poirier knew Ms. Dawson personally. In his letter, Mr. Lafleur states that at the beginning of the meeting, he had asked Ms. Poirier about her knowledge of Ms. Dawson's file and that she had replied that she had no knowledge of the file and that she was attending the meeting to attempt to explain her understanding of autism.\n[170] Mr. Lafleur testified that when Ms. Dawson learned that the union had gone to the Ottawa meeting, she was upset, especially when she realised that the person making the presentation on autism was Ms. Poirier who had been her psychologist in the past. In a second letter written to Ms. Traversy, dated January 16, 2002, Mr. Lafleur stated that he could not believe that Canada Post would have set the union up in this way knowing full well what the impact would be on Ms. Dawson.\n[171] Asked if she was aware at any time prior to the meeting that Ms. Poirier could have been Ms. Dawson treating psychologist, Ms. Boucher testified that she was not and had she been made aware, she would have looked for someone else. There is no reason for the Tribunal not to believe Ms. Boucher. The record shows that Ms. Poirier was later on disciplined by her professional order.\n[172] The evidence tends to show furthermore that Ms. Dawson was the only known autistic person working at Canada Post at the time. This is confirmed by Mr. Lafleur who stated that he thought that there was no other autistic person working at Canada Post at the time apart from Ms. Dawson.\n[173] The Tribunal finds, given the evidence, that prior to the January 14, 2002 meeting, Canada Post management was not aware or was not made aware that Ms. Poirier was Ms. Dawson's treating psychologist. The Tribunal also finds that the meeting held in Ottawa on January 14, 2002 had a double purpose: provide information on autism so as to better communicate with Ms. Dawson. The Tribunal further finds that the information provided by Ms. Poirier at the meeting most probably did not convey the proper information on autism and did not contribute to improve the relations between Ms. Dawson and Canada Post management.\n[174] Hence, the Tribunal finds that, with respect to the January 14, 2002 meeting, the Complainant and the Commission have failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation or harassment. Neither the Commission nor Ms. Dawson provided the Tribunal with any material element which indicated that Canada Post's motivation in hiring Ms. Poirier was to discriminate against Ms. Dawson on the basis of her disability, to retaliate against her for having filed a human rights complaint or to harass her. The evidence shows that, at the time, Canada Post management was seeking outside expertise so as to better understand how it could cope with Ms. Dawson and was not aware of the past professional relations that had existed between Ms. Dawson and Ms. Poirier.\nc) The work related injury [175] In her complaint form, Ms. Dawson states that, after the January 14, 2002 meeting and her declaration of a consequent validated work-related injury, the harassment she was experiencing escalated, that members of the Respondent attacked her verbally, threatening her aggressively. She further asserts that, when the Respondent's actions threatened her health, safety and life, CUPW, as well as her doctors intervened in writing. She also adds that the Respondent maintained the threat of forcing her to undergo a psychological assessment, an ordeal which would be devastating to her as an autistic person, and which was designed to be so. Ms. Dawson furthermore mentions that Richard Paradis, the Respondent's Labour Relations agent for Qu\u00e9bec remarked in a telephone call to CUPW, on March 4, 2002, that she would only mutilate herself a few more times, personally insulting her and mocking her disability.\n[176] With respect to the work related injury that Ms. Dawson declared in January 2002, the Tribunal heard evidence from both Ms. Dawson and Ms. Daoust. Dr. Piette, a physician at Medisys, who was scheduled to testify according to the Respondent's witness list, was not called to testify.\n[177] The record shows that, following the January 14, 2002 meeting in Ottawa, Ms. Dawson declared a harassment-based work accident on January 30, 2002 to the CSST, indicating as the date of the accident January 14, 2002. The record shows that the medical report attesting this injury was signed by Dr. K., Ms. Dawson's physician. Dr. K. writes in her report: victim of workplace harassment. Stress related adjustment reaction. Dx. Unable to return to work.\n[178] The record shows that Ms. Dawson went back to work on February 6, 2002. Ms. Dawson testified that she decided to go back to work because she was scared, not because she was healthy and that upon returning to work, she was not in great shape but that she was doing her work.\n[179] In a report signed by Dr. K. and dated February 5, 2002, the latter states: patient is emotionally fragile. (unreadable) she feels the ( ) to return to work because of continuous harassement (sic). The record further shows that that same day, Dr. K. wrote on a prescription script: To facilitate communication, it would be useful for Ms. Dawson to tape all the conversation with management.\n[180] In her testimony, Ms. Daoust stated that she received, after Ms. Dawson reported her work accident, the worker's claim completed by Dr. K. (Form 1940) and Dr. M.'s letter dated January 24, 2002 both in the same envelop. Ms. Daoust stated, with respect to Dr. K.'s report, that what caught her attention was the mention patient is emotionally fragile. What Ms. Daoust understood from this remark was that Ms. Dawson was not ready to come back to work. Ms. Daoust's feared at the time that Ms. Dawson would be coming back to work while still injured and that her condition would worsen.\n[181] The record shows that, in his letter, Dr. M. states that the letter reflects the content of a meeting held on April 4, 2001. He further states that he has diagnosed Ms. Dawson as being autistic, with superior intelligence associated with chronic depression related to adaptation problems due to her handicap. Dr. M. goes on to say that Ms. Dawson is capable of good judgment, has a good sense of her condition, that she is lucid and capable to make decision by herself, able to speak about her condition and that no decision concerning her condition should be made without her consent. It is to be noted here that the letter was written after the Ottawa conference, which took place, on January 14, 2002, but before Ms. Dawson reported her work accident, on January 30, 2002.\n[182] Ms. Daoust testified that after receiving the documents related to Ms. Dawson's claim, she got a call from Ms. Dawson. Ms. Daoust testified that Ms. Dawson was preoccupied by the mention chronic depression written in the medical certificate.\n[183] In the course of her cross-examination of Ms. Daoust, Ms. Dawson asked Ms. Daoust to explain what Dr. M. had to do with the accident (injury on duty absence), given that the letter written by Dr. M. does not contain any mention of a work accident and that it came out of an appointment that Ms. Dawson had had with Dr. M. approximately 9 months before the letter was written and the occurrence of her work related injury. Ms. Daoust testified that for her, the letter was not related to the accident but provided information on the state of health of Ms. Dawson.\n[184] In her testimony, Ms. Dawson explained that the January 25, 2002 letter from Dr. M. addressed to her was necessary as a certificate of diagnosis because the CSST claim was harassment based on disability and that Ms. Dawson felt compelled to establish her diagnosis through a note coming from Dr. M. Ms. Dawson stated that and the evidence shows that before giving permission to Canada Post to contact Dr. M., she wanted to ascertain why this was necessary and relevant given the nature of her claim. Ms. Dawson was of the view that Dr. M. knew nothing about the work accident and would have been puzzled to be approached.\n[185] The record indicates that after having filed her claim with the CSST, Canada Post undertook to investigate internally the allegation of harassment. At the end of its investigation, after having spoken to supervisors at the Pierrefonds postal station, Canada Post concluded that there was no harassment at the Pierrefonds postal station but that the allegation had to do with the Ottawa meeting.\n[186] The record shows that Canada Post requested that Ms. Dawson submit herself to a medical evaluation by a physician designated by Canada Post. Ms. Daoust testified that even if Ms. Dawson had gone back to work, on February 6, 2002, Canada Post still wanted an expertise or medical evaluation of her state of health for two reasons according to Ms. Daoust, 1. Canada Post did not believe that Ms. Dawson had been harassed, 2. in every case where there is an allegation of harassment, the employer asks for an evaluation - expertise. Ms. Daoust stated that given the content of the report written by Dr. K. that Ms. Dawson was fragile but felt that she had to come back to work, Canada Post felt that a second opinion was warranted to determine if she was fit to return to work or not even if Ms. Dawson had returned to work on February 6, 2002. Ms. Daoust gave as an explanation for this, that Ms. Dawson's injury was not physical, that Canada Post wanted to know if she was mentally fit to come back to work, since the injury was described as harassment in the workplace.\n[187] On this topic, Ms. Dawson testified that, after declaring her accident, many reasons were put forward by Canada Post as to why she had to submit to an expertise, including her past depression and a hernia she had sustained earlier in her career. Ms. Dawson noted in her testimony that the form filled out by Dr. K. did not mention depression or hernia which are two conditions which have nothing to do with her work accident. Ms. Dawson testified that her work accident was not in any way related to depression. Ms. Dawson furthermore stated that she did not know what the expertise was for and why Canada Post wanted that expertise and that in fact, she was told that she was going to see a specialist about her hernia and her depression, which were not the basis of her current work accident.\n[188] Ms. Daoust testified that Ms. Dawson's supervisor asked her to report to a clinic so as to be evaluated. Ms. Daoust testified that Respondent's request to have Ms. Dawson submit to a medical evaluation by a physician designated by the Respondent had a dramatic impact on Ms. Dawson. According to Ms. Daoust, Ms. Dawson told her that she could not go and see a physician that she did not know, that Canada Post had no right to ask that of her.\n[189] Ms. Dawson testified that she had two concerns with respect to the request that she submit herself to a medical examination; 1. having to go and see a physician who did not exist and 2. wanting information about how to fill out a medical certificate. Ms. Dawson did not understand why she was getting so much flack because of this and was wondering what she had done terribly wrong. She stated that Mr. Schetagne, because she wanted that information, i.e. how to fill out a medical certificate, accused her of harassing Ms. Leroux, one of her supervisors.\n[190] Ms. Dawson stated in her testimony that it was not her intention to see a Canada Post doctor after all the privacy violations she was the object of according to her (Canada Post had contacted her doctors without her permission, Canada Post had hired her psychologist). She also stated that she was not prepared to see a Canada Post doctor who had probably no experience in autism. Her fear was that doctors who do not know anything about autism will make whatever assumptions they think. Ms. Dawson repeatedly stated that she was terrified of management.\n[191] Ms. Dawson testified that, on March 1st, 2002, Donald Lafleur, a union official, informed her that she would be given a letter on March 5, 2002 forcing her to see a Canada Post paid doctor without providing her with a reason. In her testimony, Ms. Dawson stated that she could not believe that Canada Post was going to force her to see a doctor. The record shows that Ms. Dawson was provided with the letter on March 7, 2002.\n[192] The record shows that, on March 4, 2002, Dr. K. wrote a letter to whom it may concern about Ms. Dawson. The letter states that Ms. Dawson is a patient that she has been following for several years for general medical care, that she has been informed that she is to undergo an expertise examination by a medical specialist, that Ms. Dawson feels that this is being forced upon her and constitutes harassment by her employer. Dr. K. goes on to state that at the present time, Ms. Dawson is in a very fragile state of mind and that, as a physician, she is very concerned that this could provoke a serious emotional reaction from Ms. Dawson.\n[193] The record shows that, on March 4, 2002, Dr. M. also wrote a letter. In his letter, Dr. M. states that Ms. Dawson is perfectly able to work and to make decisions about herself. He recommends that Ms. Dawson be consulted about any decision about herself and that she not be subjected to changes that are brusque and go unexplained with respect to her work. Dr. M. states that this type of accommodation is as vital as adapting sidewalks to meet the needs of people in wheelchairs or to enlarge fonts for people who are visually impaired.\n[194] The record indicates that, on March 4, 2002, Mr. Pierre Contant, the union's national director for the region of Montr\u00e9al, wrote a letter to Ms. Huguette Demers, Director of Human Resources. Ms. Dawson was cc'd. In this letter, Mr. Contant expresses his consternation about the interview to be held on March 5, 2002 with Mr. Potvin so that Ms. Dawson be subjected to a medical exam. Mr. Contant expresses his disapproval about this procedure.\n[195] The records shows that on March 6, 2002, Mr. Christian Potvin, Unit superintendent at the Pierrefonds postal station, wrote to Ms. Dawson informing her that further to her injury-on-duty absence from January 31, 2002 to February 5, 2002 and to the medical certificates she had submitted to Canada Post to justify this absence and her return without consolidation and pursuant to section 212 of the Act respecting Industrial Accidents and Occupational Diseases, Canada Post would have the right to require her to submit to an independent medical assessment. Mr. Potvin goes on to say that Canada Post would be ready, however, to take another approach by adding a step to the regulatory procedure where Ms. Dawson would grant Dr. Piette, the Canada Post consulting physician, permission to contact Drs. K. and M. to obtain the required medical information.\n[196] According to Ms. Daoust's testimony, this alternate solution was considered because it appeared that it would have been difficult for Ms. Dawson to have been referred to a physician that she did not know in an unfamiliar setting. Ms. Daoust testified that she was involved in the decision to sidestep the ordinary rule. She indicated in her testimony that this was done because of the concerns expressed by Ms. Dawson.\n[197] According to Ms. Daoust, Ms. Dawson refused to have Dr. Piette contact her physicians. Ms. Daoust testified that what would have happened is, if after contacting Ms. Dawson's physicians, the Canada Post physician had been of the view that he had the information he was seeking, then there would have been no need to go ahead with the medical evaluation.\n[198] The evidence shows that the reason why Ms. Dawson did not give her permission to Canada Post to contact Dr. M. was because Ms. Dawson did not see a link between the harassment she had complained about and Dr. M. However, the Canada Post physician felt that it was pertinent to contact Dr. M., given that Dr. M.'s note was sent to Ms. Daoust at the same time as the work accident claim. Ms. Daoust stated in her testimony that this was interpreted as a document which supported certain elements of the work accident.\n[199] Ms. Daoust stated in her testimony that Ms. Dawson had up to March 11, 2002 to make her views known about Dr. Piette contacting her physicians. The record shows that Canada Post, given Ms. Dawson refusal to have Dr. Piette contact her physicians (Dr. M. and Dr. K.), decided on March 11, 2002 to send Ms. Dawson for an independent evaluation, the medical evaluation being scheduled for March 15, 2002.\n[200] According to Ms. Daoust, this - i.e. referring an employee for an independent medical evaluation when Canada Post has doubts about the employee's medical condition - was standard procedure. In fact, Ms. Daoust testified that Canada Post made an exception to the rule in the case of Ms. Dawson by first trying to get the information it was seeking from her treating physicians.\n[201] Ms. Dawson asked Ms Daoust if it was common practice to contact a physician who had nothing to do with the work accident. Ms. Daoust testified that this was a procedure which was not the normal procedure, that in fact Canada Post was proposing an alternate measure so that Ms. Dawson would not have to go through the normal process provided by the Act, i.e. submit herself to an evaluation by a physician that she did not know in an unfamiliar setting.\n[202] The record shows that on March 11, 2002, Ms. Louise Leroux, a supervisor at the Pierrefonds postal unit, wrote to Ms. Dawson advising her that she had an appointment with Dr. Jocelyn Audet, MD for a medical evaluation in accordance with article 211 of the Act respecting Industrial Accidents and Occupational Diseases. The evaluation was scheduled to take place on March 12, 2002 at the Groupe Sant\u00e9 Medisys, at 8 A.M. The letter states that the purpose of the independent medical evaluation was to determine the 5 matters indicated in section 212 of the Act.\n[203] With respect to the March 11, 2002 request, Ms. Daoust testified that Ms. Dawson expressed a concern about this request. Ms. Daoust acknowledged that there was an error in relation to the physician's name. The name of the physician should have read Aubut instead of Audet. Ms. Daoust testified that Ms. Dawson did not attend the March 11, 2002 appointment given the confusion about the physician's name. Ms. Daoust testified that another appointment was scheduled but that Ms. Dawson refused to attend.\n[204] Ms. Dawson testified that she was handed Ms. Leroux's letter on March 12, 2002. Ms. Dawson stated in her testimony that Ms. Leroux forcefully threatened her and told Ms. Dawson that she would undergo disciplinary measures if she refused to see the doctor. Ms. Leroux was not called to testify.\n[205] Ms. Dawson testified that, on March 13, 2002, Ms. Louise Leroux told her that Dr. Audet was a psychiatrist. According to Ms. Dawson, Ms. Leroux, even if she stated that Dr. Audet was a psychiatrist, stated that the appointment was for her hernia (which she had had a year before) and her depression, two conditions which had nothing to do with the work accident she declared, i.e. workplace harassment.\n[206] Ms. Dawson testified that she called Medisys to enquire about Dr. Audet. She was told that there was no Dr. Audet but a Dr. Aubut. Ms. Dawson stated that she found it confusing to be threatened by disciplinary measures if she did not agree to see a physician who did not exist.\n[207] Ms. Dawson stated, in her testimony, that the Internet research she made on Dr. Jocelyn Aubut indicated that the latter was a psychiatrist who was associated with Pinel Institute in Montr\u00e9al, which is a psychiatric hospital where individuals with criminal behavior are committed or remanded. She testified that he is not a specialist in autism.\n[208] In this respect, Ms. Dawson put in evidence documents that she obtained on the web and which show that Dr. Aubut's expertise is related to dangerous individuals, citing in support of this allegation an abstract where Dr. Aubut is cited as one of the authors of an article entitled An inventory for the evaluation of dangerousness in mental patients. Counsel for the Respondent objected to the filing of these documents, stating that they did not prove anything about who Dr. Aubut was.\n[209] The Tribunal is of the view that the evidence supports Ms. Dawson' s assertion that Dr. Aubut is not a specialist in autism, that he is associated with Pinel Institute in Montr\u00e9al and that his field of expertise is related mainly to criminal behavior, violence. Apart from objecting to the documentary evidence adduced by Ms. Dawson, the Respondent tendered no evidence disproving Ms. Dawson's assertion about Dr. Aubut which the Tribunal finds to be credible as well as Ms. Dawson's testimony and knowledge of the medical community familiar with autism.\n[210] The record shows that on March 13, 2002, Mr. Donald Lafleur, a union official who had attended the January 14, 2002, wrote to Mary Traversy, Manager, Industrial Relations at Canada Post. In his letter, he reiterates the union's objection to Canada Post sending Ms. Dawson for a medical assessment. The record further indicates that Ms. Dawson was told on March 25th that the previously cancelled expertise was scheduled for March 28, 2002.\n[211] The record finally shows that on June 14, 2002, the CSST ruled on Ms. Dawson's claim of harassment. The letter which informs Ms. Dawson of the ruling refers to the events of October 1999 which gave rise to a complaint to the Human Rights Commission and to the subsequent settlement. The letter states that, given the January 14, 2002 meeting, the events referred to in two letters from the union, that for the second time, a psychologist who knew Ms. Dawson was consulted by the union and the employer, the cognitive handicap described in Dr. M.'s letter, dated February 12, 2002, the fact that Ms. Dawson had been a letter carrier for 13 years, without any problems, the CSST concluded that Ms. Dawson was victim of a work related accident on January 14, 2002 which resulted in an adaptation deficit.\n[212] After the CSST decision, it appears that Canada Post decided not to have Ms. Dawson go through a medical evaluation or expertise by Dr. Aubut. Canada Post decided that for a four day absence, it was not worth it to pursue the expertise, energy and money wise. A business decision, stated Ms. Daoust.\n[213] In the course of her testimony, Ms. Dawson often came back in her comments to the fact that Canada Post maintained its threat of having her submit to an expertise or medical evaluation up to the month of June 2002, that the union had also sent a letter to Ms. Traversy.\n[214] On this issue, Ms. Dawson asked Ms. Daoust specifically the question if it was reasonable for Canada Post to maintain the threat of an expertise given the letter sent by Dr. K. on March 4, 2002 stating that this would be detrimental to her. Ms. Daoust answered: I cannot say and referred to the fact that one reason was that Canada Post was trying to contact her physician.\n[215] The Tribunal finds that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the Respondent, through its employees, did not provide the Complainant with a workplace free of harassment. The Tribunal finds that even in the face of major concerns expressed both by Ms. Dawson's treating physician and her union representatives, the Respondent continued to press for a medical evaluation by a Canada Post designated physician.\n[216] Indeed, the evidence shows that the Respondent remained deaf to the pleas of Ms. Dawson who did not want to see a physician whom she did not know and who knew nothing about autism, of her union representatives who expressed concern and consternation about Ms. Dawson having to submit to a medical examination by a Canada Post designated physician but more importantly, of her treating physician who stated that she was very concerned that this could provoke a serious emotional reaction from Ms. Dawson.\n[217] Still, still, still, Canada Post pressed to have Ms. Dawson submit herself to a physical examination by an unknown doctor, with full knowledge that Ms. Dawson was autistic and very poor knowledge of autism. It is worth noting here that Ms. Daoust acknowledged in her testimony that the request to have Ms. Dawson submit herself to a medical evaluation had a dramatic impact on Ms. Dawson.\n[218] And to add insult to injury, Canada Post requested that Ms. Dawson meet with a physician who, the evidence shows, was not an expert in autism, but, on a balance of probabilities, a psychiatrist, specialised in violent behavior. The record shows that Ms. Dawson had to live with the threat of having to submit to a medical evaluation for a period of three months, i.e. from March to June 2002.\n[219] However well-intended Canada Post management was in seeking a medical evaluation, the Tribunal finds that, in the present circumstances, the general behavior of those Canada Post employees who were involved in the medical evaluation process constitutes harassment. The behavior meets the criteria established in the case law with respect to what constitutes harassment, notably in Hill where the Tribunal stated that the gravamen of harassment lies in the creation of a hostile work environment, which violates the personal dignity of the complainant and in Marinaki where the Tribunal expressed the view that victims of harassment need not prove that they suffered pecuniary losses, that for a behavior to amount to harassment, some element of repetition or persistence is usually required. This said, section 65 of the Act establishes that the Respondent is responsible for the discriminatory acts of its employees, officers and directors.\n[220] The Tribunal thus finds that Ms. Dawson's disability was an important factor in the way she was treated by the Respondent in relation to the above mentioned events and that the Respondent's conduct amounts to harassment and contravenes section 14 of the Act. However, the Tribunal finds that there exists no conclusive evidence that the Respondent's conduct and that of its employees constitute retaliation.\n[221] Can Ms. Dawson be blamed for having refused to have the Medisys physician contact her physicians? The chain of events shows clearly a total lack of knowledge and understanding by Canada Post management of autism and of how autistic individuals process information. It clearly stems from the evidence that Ms. Poirier's presentation in January 2002 did not bring much to Canada Post management as to how to interact in the workplace with individuals who are autistic. There were in fact from the Ottawa meeting no lessons learned.\n(iv) The tape-recording of conversations [222] In her complaint form, Ms. Dawson states that, after the January 14, 2002 meeting, she requested a simple accommodation which would have been free of trouble or cost to the Respondent, that is, the right to tape-record her conversations with management. This measure is necessary because, Ms. Dawson asserts, she does not process information from conversations in the same way as non-autistic people.\n[223] Ms. Dawson further asserts that, from September 2001 to May 9, 2002, she was denied this accommodation and that in a telephone call on May 9, 2002, Mr. Raymond Poirier, Operation Manager for Qu\u00e9bec, told her that she was denied this accommodation measure because Canada Post did not like it. Ms. Dawson goes on to say that this comment shows intolerance for her based on her disability, that she felt unwelcomed and felt that she was held in contempt because she is disabled. Finally, Ms. Dawson states that, when the accommodation was granted in June 2002, unwarranted and demeaning conditions were attached in keeping with the Respondent's view of autism.\n[224] Ms. Dawson testified that the first time she started taping conversations at Canada Post was in May 1999, shortly after she disclosed her diagnosis. She did this with management's knowledge and permission. Ms. Dawson testified that, at the time, she just informed management that this is what she would be doing and made it obvious that she was taping. At the time, nobody asked her to stop or to provide medical papers. Ms. Dawson further testified that it is just when there is a hostile environment that it becomes necessary for her to have a precise record of her own words and actions.\n[225] Ms. Dawson stated in her testimony that she stopped taping at the end of 1999 or early 2000 but that in the fall of 2001, she asked for the permission to start taping again because she found it unwise not to ask for permission. The evidence shows that on September 30, 2001, in a letter sent to Ms. Mary Traversy, Manager Industrial Relations at Canada Post, Ms. Dawson asked for the permission to, if she finds it necessary, to tape her interactions with management, stating that as she has done before, she would let everyone know what she was doing.\n[226] The record shows that, in December 2001, Ms. Mary Traversy, in response to a letter previously sent to her by Ms. Dawson, sent a letter to the latter in which she indicates that Canada Post is still not in agreement with her request to tape conversations with management. Ms. Traversy however states that to accommodate her, Canada Post will provide her with written explanations, as appropriate.\n[227] The record indicates that, on February 5, 2002, Dr. K. wrote on a prescription script that to facilitate communication it would be useful for Ms. Dawson to tape all the conversations with management. The evidence indicates that this document was received by Canada Post.\n[228] The record further indicates that in a letter dated February 12, 2002, Dr. M., in response to a request made by Ms. Dawson, underscores the need for Ms. Dawson to tape-record the conversations that take place between herself and Canada Post people. Dr. M. states that Ms. Dawson is vulnerable to the malevolence of her peers and that she displays intense emotional reactions when people do not respect their word or make statements that do not correspond to the true nature of things. Furthermore, Dr. M. expresses the opinion that this request, if satisfied, will allow Ms. Dawson to refer to the verbatim of what is said and not to approximations. Finally, Dr. M. states that he considers that this request is related to Ms. Dawson's cognitive handicap and must be addressed with the same respect as are requests made by people who have a medical handicap.\n[229] In her testimony, Ms. Dawson confirmed Dr. M.'s statements. Ms. Dawson testified that she works with the verbatim of things and that it is hard for her to keep track of the verbatim of things in a conversation. Ms. Dawson further testified that she uses information differently compared to a non-autistic person. For her, all information is important and is weighed equally.\n[230] Ms. Dawson stated in her testimony that she handed both these letters to Christian Potvin on February 18, 2002. It appears that Mary Traversy in Ottawa as well as Mr. Lafleur, union official, obtained copies of the letters.\n[231] Ms. Daoust testified that she was personally involved in the decision to authorize the accommodation requested by Ms Dawson. In the course of her testimony, Ms. Daoust explained how requests for accommodation were processed at Canada Post. When a request for an accommodation is received, it is checked by a physician at Medisys to assess whether or not it is reasonable. Ms. Daoust testified that with respect to Ms. Dawson's request, managers at the Pierrefonds postal station were a bit reluctant to be recorded. They did not object to the accommodation but to the method suggested. This explains, according to Ms. Daoust, why it took so long to provide Ms. Dawson with the accommodation she was seeking.\n[232] According to Ms. Daoust, Canada Post, given the objections expressed by local management, wanted to speak to Ms. Dawson's physicians in order to find another type of accommodation, such as putting in writing what had been said in the course of a conversation. According to Ms. Daoust, Ms. Dawson's position was that she had two medical certificates and did not understand what the problem was notwithstanding the explanations provided by Ms. Daoust about the supervisors' concerns. According to Ms. Daoust, Ms. Dawson was of the view that it was only by recording a conversation that one could have the tone of the conversation, and that a written document would not provide this.\n[233] The record shows that, on May 23, 2002, Ms. Dawson gave her authorization to Canada Post to contact one of her physicians, Dr. M. The consent form for the release of medical information states that Ms. Dawson authorizes Dr. M. to discuss with the Medisys physician the use of a recording machine for conversation with the Canada Post management. It appears from the evidence that the delay in arriving at this was caused by the difficulty in getting hold of Ms. Dawson's physician and Ms. Dawson's request to speak about this issue with Canada Post's General Manager as well as negotiations with local management.\n[234] Ms. Dawson stated in her testimony that finally, she was informed by Mr. Potvin that she would have the accommodation she had requested. It appears that the authorization came in June 2002.\n[235] In view of the evidence, the Tribunal finds that the Complainant and the Commission have not established a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation. The evidence shows clearly that the delay in providing Ms. Dawson with the permission to tape-record conversations with management stems from the reluctance of certain employees to be tape-recorded. In the present circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent had to balance the needs of the Complainant with the concerns expressed by certain of its employees. This said, the tense relations between Ms. Dawson and management at Canada Post cannot be totally excluded as a factor having contributed to the delays.\nIV. REMEDIES [236] In its final submissions, Ms. Dawson states, with respect to the issue of remedies, the following:\nBecause I was deemed unreasonable and non-credible early in the hearings, and because I could not function adequately or sometimes even at all in the hearings, and because I did not therefore understand the hearings, and for other similar reasons unrelated to the facts of this case, I believe that this argument is futile. I suggest that autistics be warned away from CPC unless they can successfully conceal their differences and are certain that their diagnosis will never be obtained by CPC by any means. There was an impressive quantity of evidence showing that CPC is determined to make it harmful for me to interact with CPC in any way. This lends credibility to my demand that CPC leave me alone. However, I am in no position to ask for remedies. It seems pointless to have proceedings in which one of the parties is refused any accommodation and therefore can only function poorly or not at all (and is seen as dependent on the pity, charity, etc., of those who are considered typical or reasonable, and are therefore accommodated as of right). There seems to be no remedy for that.\n[237] As for the Commission, it states the following:\nPerhaps the most effective remedy this Tribunal could grant would be to order that Ms. Dawson be reinstated into the workplace in such a manner as would ensure her successful return to productive work and to a job that she clearly loved to perform and that suited her capabilities. The most effective way to effect change and tolerance in a workplace is to have the agent of change present in the workplace on a daily basis with the appropriate accommodations and safeguards in place.\nThat being said, Ms. Dawson has not requested that specific remedy and the Tribunal is not in a position to impose such a remedy upon her. However, Ms. Dawson did state in evidence that she is incapable of casting her mind into the future or speculating about where she would be today but for the alleged discrimination. She has asked at various times that she be left alone and, more specifically, kept on the books as an employee of Canada Post and that no steps be taken to terminate her employment. This would, in effect, leave the door open for her return to active employment if she feels capable of doing so in the future.\n[238] The Tribunal agrees with the Commission. Given that Ms. Dawson has not requested to be reinstated into her workplace, nor any other form of compensation by the way, the Tribunal is without jurisdiction to make such an order. This is an issue that will have to be dealt with between Ms. Dawson and the Respondent.\n[239] Furthermore, the Commission, in its final submissions, asks that an order that Canada Post work with the Commission to ensure that the discriminatory practices and behavior do not continue by ensuring:\nthat it provide a copy of its existing or amended harassment, discrimination and accommodations policies within 30 days of the Tribunal's decision; that Canada Post work with the Commission to modify their existing policies to conform with the Canadian Human Rights Act and human rights law of Canada should the Commission determine that amendments are necessary; that the employer, in consultation with the Commission, retain appropriate persons to conduct workplace equity, accommodation and sensitivity training for managers and staff, and that the employer take such further and other steps as the Commission deems appropriate in the circumstances.\nThe Tribunal agrees.\n[240] At the end of her testimony, Ms. Daoust acknowledged that it was the first time that Canada Post had to deal with an employee who was autistic, that in all probability, Canada Post mismanaged the case but that in the end, Canada Post learned from this experience.\n[241] According to Ms. Daoust, Canada Post took different measures to increase its understanding of autistic people and be better managers, such as organizing a meeting with Dr. Poirier. Canada Post had to adapt itself to Ms. Dawson's thought process. According to her, Canada Post tried to accommodate Ms. Dawson but that there are rules at Canada Post that must be followed and to try to accommodate Ms. Dawson given these rules was not always easy. Canada Post did its best, according to her, with the knowledge it had of autism.\n[242] Be this as it may, the Tribunal finds it disturbing for the future of autistic people that they be seen because of their condition to pose a threat to the safety of others and some form of nuisance in the workplace. An employer has a duty to ensure not only that all employees work in a safe environment but also that ill perceptions about an employee's condition due to poor or inadequate information about his disability lead other employees to have negative and ill-founded perceptions about him.\n[243] An autistic person should expect that his workplace be free of any misperception or misconception about his condition. It goes to the right of autistic individuals to be treated equally, with dignity and respect, free of any discrimination or harassment related to their condition. In this respect, in a society where human rights are paramount, an employer has the duty to dispel such misconception or misperception about such individuals.\n[244] This duty stems from the Canadian Human Rights Act and the need to get rid of any discriminatory behavior in the workplace as well as in society in general. It is worth reminding employers as well as society as a whole that the purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act, as stated in section 2 of the Act, is to give effect to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n[245] Autistic people, if they want to be able to accomplish themselves in a workplace or in society, need to be reassured that everything possible short of undue hardship will be done in order to ensure that misperceptions and misconceptions about their condition are properly handled by their employer, so that co-workers have a proper understanding of their condition and are not inclined to discriminate against them or harass them.\n[246] To discriminate on the basis of somebody's physical appearance or social behavior might be one of the cruelest forms of discrimination. Here, Ms. Dawson was seen or perceived, at one point in her career at Canada Post, to be a threat to her co-workers because she had self-injured in the past, not because she had assaulted colleagues. She was later on perceived as a form of nuisance because she insisted on obtaining rational responses to her queries and never backed down. The fact of the matter is that Ms. Dawson was, until her diagnosis became officially known to Canada Post in 1999, seen as an excellent employee.\n[247] The Tribunal is of the opinion, in view of the evidence, that the Respondent needs to review its policies in relation to discrimination and harassment and put in place educational programs that will sensitize its employees as well as management to the needs of disabled individuals in the workplace, notably autistic individuals, so that individuals such as Ms. Dawson will not have to suffer from a lack of knowledge and understanding of their condition. In this respect, given the Canadian Human Rights Commission's expertise in these matters, the latter can surely provide assistance, which should be welcomed, to the Respondent.\nV. ORDER [248] For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the complaint filed by Ms. Dawson against Canada Post is substantiated and that the Respondent has contravened sections 7 and 14 of the Act. Given that Ms. Dawson did not request any remedial measures, the Tribunal will not award any. However, the Tribunal orders the Respondent:\nto provide a copy of its existing or amended harassment, discrimination and accommodations policies within 30 days of the Tribunal's decision; to work for a period of one year with the Commission to modify its existing policies to conform with the Canadian Human Rights Act and human rights law of Canada should the Commission determine that amendments are necessary; to retain, in consultation with the Commission, appropriate persons to conduct workplace equity, accommodation and sensitivity training for managers and staff, notably in relation to autism and autistic individuals; and to take such further and other steps as the Commission deems appropriate in the circumstances.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nSeptember 12, 2008\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1053\/3405\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMichelle Dawson v.

Jensen\n[1] The Respondent, Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (the Department), has requested that the Tribunal dismiss a complaint by Margaret Kelly (Stacey) against the Department on the basis that the matters raised in the complaint were the subject of an unconditional settlement agreement reached by the parties in 2003.\n[2] This is the second time that the Respondent has made this request. On May 27, 2008, the Tribunal dismissed the motion ruling that the request was premature as a more complete record was needed to make a determination. The Tribunal did not rule on the merits of the motion and indicated that the Respondent was free to bring a similar motion at a later date.\n[3] Since that ruling the parties have disclosed all the documents in their possession and their Statements of Particulars. In addition, the Respondent has filed two Affidavits in support of the present motion, one from Louis-Alexandre Guay, counsel for the Department of Justice Canada, and the other from Allan Tallman, of the Indian Registrar Office of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada. Attached as exhibits to those Affidavits are numerous documents including the complaints, the Settlement Agreement, the Membership Law, and a Certificate of Independent Legal Advice. In my view, there is now sufficient material on the record to make a determination on the present motion.\nBackground\n[4] In 1999, the Complainant filed human rights complaints against the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake (MCK) and the Department (then known as the Department of Indian and Northern Development). She alleged that the MCK refused to accept her as a Band member based on her family status, and that this refusal resulted in her being denied services from the MCK. She claimed that the denial of services constituted a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA or the Act). In her complaint against the Department, Ms. Kelly (Stacey) alleged that the Department was also discriminating against her by not intervening in the Band's conduct and by continuing to fund the MCK for the provision of services that were allegedly being denied to her.\n[5] In 2003, the Complainant settled her complaints with the MCK and the Department. At the time that the settlement was being concluded, MCK was revising its Membership Law. It was thought that the revision might resolve the issues that were raised in the complaints. The settlement agreement reflected the uncertainty regarding the resolution of the complaint by stating that although Ms. Kelly (Stacey) released MCK from all actions that she ever had or may have, if Ms. Kelly (Stacey) and MCK did not reach a satisfactory resolution of the Membership Claim by December 31, 2004, then the release only insofar as it relates to the Membership Claim against MCK, is null and void.\n[6] In contrast, the provision in the settlement agreement regarding the Department was unconditional. It stipulated that Ms. Kelly (Stacey) released the Department and the Crown from all actions that she had or may have arising in any way out of the matters alleged in the complaint against the Department including without limitation the Monetary Claim and the Membership Claim against the Department.\n[7] Ms. Kelly (Stacey) received independent legal advice before signing the agreement. The Certificate of Independent Legal Advice indicates that she was fully aware of the terms of the Settlement Agreement and their legal impact before signing the agreement.\n[8] After the agreement was signed, the Canadian Human Rights Commission approved the settlement agreement and a Notice of Discontinuance was filed before the Tribunal in both files on December 23, 2003. The settlement agreement was made enforceable as an order of the Federal Court pursuant to subsection 48(3) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[9] In 2005, the Complainant filed new complaints against the MCK, the Department and the Council of Elders, alleging that her membership issue had not been resolved under the new Kahnawake Membership Law and that she continued to be denied access to programs and services. The complaints were referred to the Tribunal for further inquiry.\nAnalysis\n[10] The Respondent, the Department, argues that the Tribunal should dismiss the complaint against the Department because the matters raised in the complaint have been settled.\n[11] The Respondent, MCK, does not oppose the motion. It submits that the present dispute does not involve the Department but is an internal membership dispute between the Complainant and the Respondent MCK.\n[12] The Commission does not oppose the motion to dismiss the complaint against the Department.\n[13] The Complainant, Ms. Kelly (Stacey), provided a submission stating that as a First Nations person she does not fall within Canadian jurisdiction. Rather, she attorns only to the jurisdiction of a traditional body consisting of the People, in accordance with the Great Law of Peace and the Two Row Wampum. In her view, any negotiations made with the Government of Canada do not apply to her. Those negotiations would seem to include the negotiations leading to the settlement agreement.\n[14] In my view, the Tribunal's authority to make a determination on the issue raised in this motion resides in the power granted to it under s. 50(2) of the CHRA to decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining a matter in the course of an inquiry. In Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp. 2004 FC 81, the Federal Court indicated that the determination of a preliminary issue was part of the inquiry process. As master of its own house, the Tribunal was entitled to clear the procedural underbrush prior to holding a hearing on the merits of the case.\n[15] Ms. Kelly (Stacey) received monetary compensation in exchange for an agreement not to bring any further action regarding the matters raised in the complaint against the Department. The matters raised in the 1999 complaint against the Department are identical to the issues raised in the 2005 complaint against the Department: the failure of the Department to prevent the MCK from excluding Ms. Kelly (Stacey) from Band membership and from denying her membership benefits. Although the settlement agreement left open the possibility of filing a complaint against the MCK if Ms. Kelly (Stacey) was not happy with the outcome of the Membership Renewal process, it explicitly closed that possibility with respect to the Department. The settlement agreement left no option to raise the issue again with the Department. Ms. Kelly (Stacey) received legal assistance to help her to understand this point.\n[16] The material on the file in the present case indicates that Ms. Kelly (Stacey) did not sign the agreement until she had received independent legal advice. The lawyer with whom she consulted certified that he was satisfied that Ms. Kelly (Stacey) fully understood and accepted the terms of the agreement and the legal consequences of signing the agreement. He further satisfied himself that she was not compelled or under duress to enter into the settlement agreement and that she did so on a voluntary basis.\n[17] Ms. Kelly (Stacey) has not challenged the validity of the release on the basis of duress, capacity, non est factum or any other such basis. Her claim that she does not recognize the jurisdiction of the federal government does not affect the validity of the release.\n[18] In the Tribunal's previous ruling on this issue, Vice-Chairperson Hadjis noted that new facts appeared to have emerged after the signing of the release that might affect the applicability of the release. Those facts included the development of a new Membership Law by MCK, and the delegation of the power to determine Band membership to the Council of Elders.\n[19] The settlement agreement, however, clearly contemplated that a new Membership Law was being developed and that depending upon how that Law was applied to the Complainant, she might wish to file a fresh complaint against the MCK. That right was not reserved with respect to the Department. Therefore, the new Membership Law has no bearing on the applicability of the release to the present complaint against the Department.\n[20] The issue of the Department's power to intervene in matters regarding the Complainant's membership in the Band was settled in 2003. Therefore, the delegation of the power to decide Band membership to the Council of Elders is not relevant to the applicability of the release to the complaint against the Department.\n[21] In my view, therefore, the record now discloses that neither of these two fresh facts has any bearing on the application of the release to the complaint against the Department.\n[22] This is not a case where Ms. Kelly (Stacey) has contracted out of her right to the protection of the CHRA. Ms. Kelly (Stacey) signed an agreement not to raise this particular issue with the Department again; the matter was resolved. That is not the same as signing an employment contract or a lease that denies recourse to the CHRA for any potential future claims of violations of the Act. As in the case of Gee v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue) 2002 FCA 4, I find it difficult to characterize the agreement in this case as an agreement to opt out of the protection of the Act.\n[23] As the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal stated in Thompson v. Providence Health Care 2003 BCHRT 58, there is a strong public policy interest in encouraging parties to resolve their disputes on a voluntary, consensual basis. This public policy would be severely undermined if parties who had entered into a final settlement of their human rights dispute were, absent public policy considerations to the contrary, permitted to come forward and pursue a complaint before the Tribunal. Ms. Kelly (Stacey) settled her complaint against the Department in 2003; she should not be permitted to pursue the same complaint before the Tribunal now.\n[24] Ms. Kelly (Stacey)'s complaint against the Department is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Hadjis\n[1] The Respondent, United Parcel Service Canada Ltd. (UPS), claims that the Complainant, Esper Powell, settled her human rights complaint against UPS in 2007. As a result, UPS has filed a motion seeking an order from the Tribunal confirming the alleged settlement and bringing the present case before the Tribunal to a close.\n[2] In January 2002, Ms. Powell filed her complaint, in which she alleged that she had been discriminated against by her employer, UPS, on the basis of her sex (female) and her race and colour (black). In August 2004, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) referred the complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry. The hearing into the complaint was scheduled to begin on June 11, 2007. In advance of that date, Ms. Powell and UPS began settlement discussions through their respective counsel, which ultimately resulted in UPS accepting a counter-offer from Ms. Powell. On June 8, 2007, UPS's counsel sent an email message to Mr. Powell's counsel confirming this acceptance. UPS's counsel ended his correspondence by stating, This matter has therefore settled. Ms. Powell's counsel sent an email message in reply on the same day saying that he confirms that this matter is resolved accordingly.\n[3] UPS's counsel immediately advised the Tribunal that the case had been settled. The Tribunal therefore wrote to the parties on the same day (June 8, 2007), informing them that the matter was adjourned sine die pending a notice from the Commission that the minutes of settlement had been approved pursuant to s. 48(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Tribunal added that upon receipt of such notice from the Commission, the Tribunal would issue a Notice of Discontinuance, closing the matter.\n[4] According to UPS, Ms. Powell has refused to follow up with the steps needed to finalize the settlement. She did not sign the proposed minutes of settlement nor the Full and Final Release prepared by UPS's counsel. On November 20, 2007, UPS's counsel informed the Tribunal that the minutes of settlement had yet to be signed, and on November 27, 2007, Ms. Powell advised the Tribunal that she had changed legal counsel. The Tribunal replied to the parties that in the absence of a signed settlement resolving the complaint, the case would proceed to hearing.\n[5] UPS takes the position that the matter before the Tribunal was fully settled through the exchange of correspondence that took place between counsel in June 2007, irrespective of whether or not minutes of settlement were ultimately signed. It has therefore brought the present motion seeking an order confirming the settlement of the complaint.\n[6] According to s. 48 of the Act, settlements of any complaints that are reached before the commencement of a hearing must be referred to the Commission for approval or rejection:\n48. (1) When, at any stage after the filing of a complaint and before the commencement of a hearing before a Human Rights Tribunal in respect thereof, a settlement is agreed on by the parties, the terms of the settlement shall be referred to the Commission for approval or rejection.\n(2) If the Commission approves or rejects the terms of a settlement referred to in subsection (1), it shall so certify and notify the parties.\n(3) A settlement approved under this section may, for the purpose of enforcement, be made an order of the Federal Court on application to that Court by the Commission or a party to the settlement.\n48. (1) Les parties qui conviennent d'un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, mais avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience d'un tribunal des droits de la personne, en pr\u00e9sentent les conditions \u00e0 l'approbation de la Commission.\n(2) Dans le cas pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe (1), la Commission certifie sa d\u00e9cision et la communique aux parties.\n(3) Le r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission peut, par requ\u00eate d'une partie ou de la Commission \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de cette juridiction et \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle.\nIn its written submissions on UPS's motion, the Commission points out that there is no evidence that a settlement has been approved by the Commission. Consequently, the Commission adds, there is no settlement binding upon the parties that could be made an order of the Federal Court, pursuant to s. 48(3).\n[7] UPS contends that the Commission's role under s. 48 is simply to approve or reject settlements that have been entered into, and not to determine whether a settlement has been reached. UPS submits that this is a matter to be decided by the Tribunal. In the circumstances of the present case, UPS argues that a binding settlement was in fact arrived at, notwithstanding the absence of any Commission approval.\n[8] In my view, this argument is based on an erroneous interpretation of s. 48. The terms of the provision are clear. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, no complaint can be settled without Commission approval. The Federal Court pointed out in Loyer v. Air Canada, 2006 FC 1172 at para. 87, that:\nThere has been little judicial consideration of section 48 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. However, when the section is read in context, consistent with the aims of the Act as a whole, and in light of the public interest mandate of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, it is clear that the section is there to ensure that the Commissioners themselves have input into settlements, so as to ensure that the remedial goals of the Act are adequately addressed in the resolution of individual complaints.\n[emphasis added]\n[9] Under s. 48, there is no option made available to the parties to choose whether or not to submit the settlement to the Commission. In the English rendering of the section, it is stated that the settlement shall be referred to the Commission. In the French rendering, the parties present the terms of the settlement for approval by the Commission. This requirement is consistent with the finding in Loyer that the section exists to ensure that the Commissioners have an input into settlements to make certain that the remedial goals of the Act are adequately addressed in the resolution of the individual complaints. Without such input, there can be no settlement.\n[10] There is no indication that the Commission has either explicitly or tacitly approved the alleged settlement between Ms. Powell and UPS. Absent such approval, it cannot be said that there exists a settlement bringing about an end to the Tribunal's inquiry into the complaint.\n[11] Of course, according to s. 48, this approval would only have been required if the settlement was agreed on prior to the commencement of the hearing. UPS submits, as an additional argument, that the settlement in this case was not in fact reached before the commencement of the hearing, within the meaning of s. 48. It claims that the Tribunal has undertaken steps, including case conferences and the issuance of various procedural orders, which demonstrate that it has embarked on the hearing process. As such, the commencement of a hearing has taken place and the Commission's approval of the settlement is no longer required.\n[12] I do not agree with UPS's submission. While the Act refers to a hearing and an inquiry, there is no mention made anywhere of a hearing process. The Federal Court considered these two terms (hearing and inquiry) in Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 at para. 17. The Court pointed out that s. 50 of the Act makes reference to each of these expressions separately, and treats them as distinct notions. The Court was sitting in review of a ruling by the Tribunal on a preliminary motion that the respondent had filed seeking the dismissal of the complaint prior to the start of the hearing into the merits of the complaint. The Commission had argued that the Tribunal was required to conduct the hearing before dismissing the complaint and that the motion was therefore premature. The Court disagreed. It concluded that although, according to s. 50, a Tribunal must conduct an inquiry into every complaint referred to it, there is no requirement that there be a hearing in every case. The motion to dismiss was thus not premature.\n[13] I take it, therefore, from the Court's finding, that the meaning to be assigned to the term hearing is the conduct of the actual hearing into the merits of the complaint itself. It does not encompass any preceding activity, including preliminary motions that the Tribunal may entertain in order to clear the procedural underbrush (Canada Post at para. 14), such as the motion to dismiss that had been brought in that case.\n[14] In the present instance, UPS contends that merely because the Tribunal held a number of case conferences by telephone, issued some directions on matters such as scheduling and disclosure, and ruled on a preliminary motion (which was on the basis of written submissions only), the hearing within the meaning of the Act has commenced. This contention clearly does not accord with the Court's findings in Canada Post. In my view, the hearing with respect to Ms. Powell's human rights complaint has not yet commenced. Section 48 is therefore applicable and, in the absence of Commission approval, the complaint cannot be said to have been settled.\n[15] For all the above reasons, UPS's motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[1] The Respondent has made a motion to adjourn the re-hearing into the complaint, pending the outcome of its application before the Federal Court. The application seeks a judicial review of the Tribunal Chairperson's decision not to give his approval to Me Pierre Deschamps, to conclude the inquiry into the present case. The Commission and the Complainant oppose the motion.\n[2] The Respondent indicates that the Federal Court has set down December 11, 2008, as the hearing date of the judicial review application. The Respondent also notes that the Commission has consented to the order being sought by the Respondent from the Federal Court. The Complainant, for her part, has requested that the Tribunal Chairperson reconsider his decision. Thus, the Respondent submits that there will be little, if any, contestation to its judicial review application. If the Federal Court grants the order being sought, the re-hearing of the complaint will no longer be necessary. The Respondent is therefore seeking an adjournment pending the conclusion of the Federal Court proceedings.\n[3] However, as the Commission has pointed out, the Tribunal Chairperson has recently made a motion to intervene into the hearing of the judicial review application. This motion for intervention will be heard by the Court on October 22, 2008.\n[4] It is not clear at this time what bearing the outcome of this motion may have on the ultimate determination of the judicial review. The Federal Court may still dismiss the judicial review application, notwithstanding the respective positions of the principal parties, in which case any adjournment would result in an unnecessary delay in the process. As Justice Harrington indicated in his ruling on the Respondent's previous motion for a stay of proceedings in this case, Une suspension d'instance causerait une perte de temps pr\u00e9cieux si la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire est rejet\u00e9e, que ce soit en premi\u00e8re instance ou en appel. (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (les Forces canadiennes) c. Montreuil, 2008 CF 530 at para. 37).\n[5] The Commission points out that this human rights complaint alleges discriminatory practices dating back to 1999. The complaint was filed in 2002 and was referred to the Tribunal in 2005. Proceedings before the Tribunal are to be run as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and procedure allow (s. 48.9 (1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act). The Tribunal may adjourn its proceedings at its discretion having regard to principles of natural justice (see Brooks v. Canada (Fisheries and Oceans), 2007 CHRT 4 at para. 6). Some examples of natural justice concerns to which the Tribunal could respond would include the unavailability of evidence, the need to adjourn to obtain counsel, or late disclosure by an opposite party.\n[6] In the present case, just as in the Brooks case, one cannot predict the final outcome of the judicial review proceedings. For the Respondent to obtain an adjournment, it must demonstrate that allowing the Tribunal proceedings to follow their course will result in a denial of natural justice. The Respondent has not, in my view, established that any such prejudice would come to it.\n[7] The Respondent brought up in its motion that the parties may not be available for the re-hearing until January 2009, based on statements that they made back in August 2008. Aside from the fact that these alleged declarations of availability may no longer be accurate, I fail to see their relevance to this discussion. Counsel and parties will always have busy schedules. This should not preclude the Tribunal from advancing the hearing process in an expeditious fashion, as mandated by the Act.\n[8] For these reasons, the Respondent's motion for an adjournment is dismissed.\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n[1] The Respondent, Correctional Service of Canada, has filed a motion requesting that the complaint of Michael Pochay be dismissed as abandoned.\n[2] Mr. Pochay complained on October 22, 2003 that the Cross Gender Staffing Policies and Guidelines of Correctional Services of Canada were applied in a discriminatory way to male inmates as compared to female inmates in federal institutions.\n[3] During the investigation of the complaint by the Canadian Human Rights Commission, the Complainant made contact with the Commission only once on August 17, 2006. Thereafter, he ceased to have any contact with the Commission. Numerous attempts were made to reach the Complainant. However, it appeared that he had moved and changed his phone numbers. The Commission's efforts to locate the Complainant were unsuccessful.\n[4] On May 26, 2008 the Tribunal wrote to the parties to advise that the complaint had been referred to it for further inquiry. On June 16, 2008 the letter to the Complainant was returned by Priority Courier, unclaimed and marked Name not listed 08\/05\/28. The Tribunal made numerous attempts to contact the Complainant by mail and by telephone. These efforts were unsuccessful. The Tribunal was unable to make contact with the Complainant and the Complainant has made no effort to contact the Tribunal.\n[5] On June 26, 2008 a case management teleconference was held to commence preparation for the hearing. The Complainant did not attend the teleconference.\n[6] In its motion the Respondent argues that the Complainant has demonstrated an unwillingness to proceed with his complaint. Therefore, the complaint should be dismissed.\n[7] For its part, the Commission argues that dismissing a complaint at this stage is an extraordinary remedy and may result in a denial of natural justice. The Commission submits that while the Tribunal has the authority to dismiss a complaint without a hearing (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corporation 2004 FC 81, at para. 19), it is premature to do so at the present stage. Rather, the Commission suggests that the Tribunal order the Complainant to comply with Rule 6(1) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure by submitting his Statement of Particulars within three weeks, failing which his complaint may be dismissed.\n[8] I agree with the Commission's suggestion. The Complainant is therefore directed to serve and file within three weeks of the date of this ruling his Statement of Particulars setting out the items listed in Rule 6(1) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. Should he fail to do so, his complaint may be dismissed.\n[9] The present motion is dismissed without prejudice to the Respondent's right to renew its request should the Complainant fail to conform to the requirement to provide his Statement of Particulars within three weeks.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] By decision of this Tribunal dated June 20, 2008 (2008 CHRT 26), the complaint made by Ms. Keeper-Anderson to the Canadian Human Rights Commission on October 13, 2004 against the respondent Southern Chiefs Organization Inc. (SCO) was found to be substantiated. At the hearing, Ms. Keeper-Anderson requested the Tribunal award:\nlost income for the period May 2005 to May 2007 being $90,000 at $45,000\/annum, the salary she claims she was receiving at the time her employment was terminated; lost benefits of $5,000; $5,000 for pain and suffering; $15,000 as damages for the willful and reckless conduct of SCO; costs incurred in selling her house; legal costs; and interest on the above amounts.\n[2] As per the Tribunal's decision dated June 20, 2008 (2008 CHRT 26) and to assist in deciding the amount of remedy, the complainant was instructed to provide the Tribunal, by July 15, 2008, with information regarding her total income received from all sources from May 2005 to May 2007 and whether she was required to reimburse for employment insurance benefits or to any other government agency for any income assistance benefits she received during that period.\n[3] Ms. Keeper-Anderson requested and was granted an extension to July 28, 2008 to provide this information with respect to remedy. She submitted her material to the Tribunal on July 25, 2008.\n[4] On July 31, 2008, the Tribunal directed that SCO would have until August 6, 2008 to respond to the complainant's submissions regarding remedy. This was extended to August 11 and then to September 5, 2008. However, SCO has not provided any submissions in response to those received from Ms. Keeper-Anderson.\n[5] The material provided by Ms. Keeper-Anderson includes her income tax returns for the years 2005-2007; a discharge statement from her legal representative with respect to the discharge of the mortgage for her residence and also a reference to legal costs and disbursements estimated to November 8, 2005 Re: litigation matters of $1,100; pay history details for the period from February 2004 through April 2005, a student loan account statement, and correspondence relating to orthodontic work and vision care.\n[6] Ms. Keeper-Anderson claims lost wages for the period from May, 2005 to May, 2007. As such, both the salary that she would have received and her total income as per her income tax returns for this time period must be prorated to reflect this. I have prorated Ms. Keeper-Anderson's salary for May 2005-2007 and subtracted her prorated income as reported in her 2005-2007 income tax returns. On that basis, I estimate that her lost income to be $40,000.\n[7] As to her claim of $5,000 for lost benefits, the information that she submitted does not support her claim. I therefore refuse to allow this amount.\n[8] As to Ms. Keeper-Anderson's request for reimbursement for the costs incurred for the sale of her house, Ms Keeper-Anderson provided information showing two items, estimated property management costs to November 8, 2005 of $720 and legal costs and disbursements estimated to November 8, 2005 of $5,627. She did not provide any explanation as to what these costs are for. Accordingly, her request is not allowed.\n[9] Ms. Keeper-Anderson claims legal costs and disbursements estimated to November 8, 2005 of $1,100, Re: litigation matters. Ms. Keeper-Anderson retained a lawyer to challenge her termination and seek reinstatement. The evidence at the hearing indicated that there was some correspondence between Ms. Keeper-Anderson's lawyer and the SCO's lawyer, but nothing more. The documentation that she submitted makes no reference to this. In these circumstances, I award $200 for legal expenses.\n[10] Similarly, Ms. Keeper-Anderson has failed to provide any evidence or convincing argument demonstrating willful or reckless behaviour on the part of the respondent. Her claim in the amount of $15,000 is therefore refused.\n[11] It is nevertheless clear from the evidence that Ms Keeper-Anderson has suffered from the loss of her job and I award $2,000 for her pain and suffering resulting from the discriminatory actions of the SCO.\n[12] Interest under section 53(4) of the Canadian Human Rights Act on the total award of $42,200 will accrue in accordance with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure 9(12).\nSigned by\nJ.

Before the commencement of the hearing, the Tribunal Registry Officer called for appearances and asked the parties to complete their records of appearance. Mr. Daniel Poulin, counsel for the Canadian Human Rights Commission and Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Dandonneau, co-counsel for the respondent Mohawk Council of Kahnawake were in attendance. Mr. Dandonneau advised the Tribunal that his co-counsel, Ms. Mary Lee Armstrong, would be arriving shortly, and she did.\n[2] The complainant, Margaret Kelly (Stacey), did not appear and was not in attendance at the open of the hearing nor did anyone appear on her behalf. No one appeared on behalf of the Council of Elders.\n[3] The Tribunal adjourned the hearing until 2:00 o'clock of that same day. Upon resumption, the Registry Officer read the case for hearing and again called for appearances. Counsel for the Commission and respondent were again in attendance but neither Ms. Kelly nor anyone on her behalf were present.\n[4] Documents were filed as Tribunal exhibit T-1 confirming notification of this hearing to the complainant, including:\nLetter dated October 1, 2008 from the Tribunal summarizing the September 30, 2008 case management conference call; Tribunal's Revised Notice of Hearing dated October 1, 2008 confirming the October 16-17, 2008 and October 27-31, 2008 hearing dates; Tribunal Ruling 2008 CHRT 42 dated September 30, 2008 dismissing the complaint in Tribunal file T1270\/8207, Margaret Kelly (Stacey) v.

An order for measures to redress the discrimination and prevent its recurrence (s. 53(2)(a))\n[1] The Complainant, Valerie Deschambeault, is a M\u00e9tis woman. In 2004 and 2005, she applied twice for a job with the Respondent, the Cumberland House Cree Nation. On both occasions, she was not selected. She alleges in her human rights complaint that she was denied the position because she is M\u00e9tis and not of treaty origin, i.e. she is not a First Nation member of the Cumberland House Cree Nation (the Band). She did not specify in her complaint form which provision of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) she alleges to have been violated. However, in the Summary of Complaint form that the Commission attached to her complaint, s. 7 is cited as the applicable section of the CHRA and national or ethnic origin is given as the relevant prohibited ground for the alleged discrimination.\n[2] For the reasons set out below, I have found that her complaint is substantiated. I have also determined that the Band cannot, in the present case, benefit from the immunity provided in s. 7 of the CHRA.\nI. Facts [3] For most of her life, Ms. Deschambeault has lived in the Northern Village of Cumberland House (the Village), which is situated on an island (Pine Island) on the Saskatchewan River in a remote area of north-eastern Saskatchewan, some 350 km from Prince Albert. The Village shares the island with the Cumberland House Cree Nation Reserve. They are located just a couple of kilometres apart from each other. They share some services, such as the island\u2019s one arena, and their respective residents attend each other\u2019s schools (one on each side). There is one post office on the island, situated on the Village side.\n[4] Not all of the registered members of the Band reside on the reserve. According to figures published by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, only 592 of the 1062 registered Band members live on the reserve (February 2007 figures). Most of the members living off the reserve reside in the Village. The Village\u2019s population is composed almost entirely of Band members and M\u00e9tis. Some M\u00e9tis live on the reserve as well. Thus, the lives of the First Nation Band members and the M\u00e9tis are very much intertwined. They have grown up together and in many cases are related to one another. However, as Ms. Deschambeault testified, some people still make a point of distinguishing between those who are First Nation Band members (treaty) and those who are M\u00e9tis.\nA. The 2004 Competition [5] In 2004, Ms. Deschambeault was working as an addiction counsellor at the Pine Island Health Centre, an outpatient treatment centre located in the Village. She saw a notice that had been posted by the Band in the Village\u2019s post office advising that a competition had been opened for the position of Residential School Healing Facilitator.\n[6] This position was created as a result of an agreement that the Band had reached with the Aboriginal Healing Foundation, an organization that was established in 1998 following the issuance of a report by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal People. The Foundation\u2019s purpose was to assist with the support and rehabilitation of individuals who suffered abuse under the residential schools system. Its funding came from the Government of Canada.\n[7] The Band had signed the agreement with the Foundation in June 2004 for the funding of a healing project. Its goals included striving to eliminate all forms of family and community violence arising from the legacy of physical and sexual abuse in residential schools and supporting individual, family and community healing. The project called for the establishment of a two-year term position of a healing facilitator to coordinate and facilitate the support.\n[8] Ms. Deschambeault had previously held a position with the M\u00e9tis Addictions Council of Saskatchewan regarding a project that had been funded by the Foundation. The job included visiting M\u00e9tis communities and working with residential school victims in need of healing. She therefore applied to compete for the facilitator\u2019s position. The job posting for the position did not mention any preferential hiring policy for Band members.\n[9] The selection process was administered by Lisa Cook, who was the Band\u2019s Health Director at the time. Six persons applied and the Band invited them to be interviewed. Four of the applicants agreed to attend the interview, including Ms. Deschambeault. She was the only one of the four who was M\u00e9tis. The other three candidates were all First Nation as well as members of the Band.\n[10] Lisa Cook testified that she had prepared a series of interview questions for the candidates, in conjunction with the human resources department of the Prince Albert Grand Council, an umbrella organization made up of twelve Saskatchewan First Nations, including the Band. The questions themselves were then approved by the Band Council. The interviews were conducted by a panel composed of the Chief and all four other members of the Band Council, as well as two representatives from the Grand Council\u2019s human resources department, one Band elder, and Lisa Cook.\n[11] The interview panellists were to take turns asking one or two of the questions to each of the candidates. The panellists were provided with question sheets containing spaces to jot down notes. Lisa Cook testified that after the interviews were completed, the panel members discussed their respective scores for each candidate. She wrote down the points given by each panel member on a board. She then averaged out the results for each candidate.\n[12] Ms. Deschambeault placed first. Ms. Cook testified that she took the results and presented them at a meeting of the Band Council. She was asked to stay outside the room while the Band Council deliberated, a request that Ms. Cook testified she found very surprising. One Council member told her that Band members would deal with Band membership issues. Ms. Cook is First Nation but not a member of the Band.\n[13] The Band Council decided to hire Kathleen Settee-Cramer (Ms. Cramer), who is First Nation and a member of the Band. Ms. Cramer had placed second in the interview panel\u2019s scoring.\n[14] Patricia Laliberte acted as secretary to the Band Council for a two-week period in 2004. She testified that she was present at a meeting of the Band Council where the matter of the appointment for the facilitator\u2019s position was discussed. She recalls members of Council indicating that it should be a Band member who is hired.\n[15] Lisa Cook testified that the following day, the then Chief of the Band, and one of the Band\u2019s councillors both told her that Ms. Cramer obtained the position because Council had decided to select a Band member.\n[16] Ms. Cramer gave evidence that after being informed that she had been selected for the position, she overheard the same councillor who had spoken to Ms. Cook say that she had obtained the job because she was a Band member. She then spoke to her father, who is a former Band chief, about what she had heard. After verifying, he confirmed to her that she had been selected because she was a Band member. She testified that she was saddened by this news. She had been friends with Ms. Deschambeault since childhood and knew that Ms. Deschambeault was more qualified than she was. She nonetheless opted to accept the position as she felt she could still make a difference within her community with respect to the program that she would administer.\n[17] Shortly thereafter, Ms. Cramer told Ms. Deschambeault about what she had learned regarding the competition. Although Ms. Deschambeault was very hurt and disappointed at not having been given the job despite placing first in the interview panel\u2019s assessment, she did not want to cause any harm to Ms. Cramer. Ms. Deschambeault decided to let matters go and did not file any complaint with the Band following the competition.\nB. The 2005 Competition [18] Although the facilitator position was for a two-year term ending in 2006, Ms. Cramer resigned from the job on March 16, 2005. She testified that she found the workplace unhealthy and that she felt harassed. Immediately after resigning, Ms. Cramer became a candidate in that month\u2019s Band Council election. Band regulations apparently stipulate that candidates must resign from their Band employment positions during election periods. The Band therefore contends that the real reason for her resignation was so as to run for Council. Ms. Cramer did not end up winning a council seat.\n[19] Whatever her true motivations for resigning may have been, the end result was that the facilitator position fell vacant before the end of its term. Lisa Cook had been away on personal leave when Ms. Cramer resigned. Upon her return in April 2005, Angus Mackenzie, a newly elected Band councillor who had been given charge of the health portfolio, instructed Ms. Cook to prepare the selection process to fill the position. The advertisement for the job had already been posted by the Band while Lisa Cook was on leave.\n[20] The Band Council had recently assembled a new Health Committee comprised of four Band members, which was to advise the Council on issues relating to the health care portfolio. Lisa Cook was informed that the seven-member committee assessing the applications for the facilitator position would be comprised of the four Health Committee members along with one former Band councillor (Raymond Chaboyer), Mr. Mackenzie, and one Elder. Ms. Cook testified that the Grand Council opted not to participate in the process this time.\n[21] The selection process that Lisa Cook organized was similar to the 2004 competition\u2019s, with some minor changes. Scoring was to be made on a scale of 1 to 5 rather than 1 to 4, for instance, and a more elaborate essay portion was added to ensure that the candidates had the requisite report writing skills. This latter component was, however, not factored into the panel\u2019s final scoring of the candidates.\n[22] Three persons applied for the position, Clara Cook, Ms. Deschambeault, and Ms. Cramer (who was in effect re-applying for the position). Ms. Deschambeault was the only non-First Nation and non-Band member to apply. She testified that she had seen advertisements for the competition at the post office and the gas station, and she had heard an announcement on the local radio station. She saw that the required qualifications and tasks were unchanged from the 2004 competition. She also testified that she ran into the Band\u2019s newly elected Chief, Walter Sewap, at the gas station and asked him if the competition was going to be restricted to Band members. He replied that the competition was open to anyone, not just Band members, and that the newly created Health Committee would be overseeing the process and making a recommendation for selection to Council. She felt reassured and decided to apply.\n[23] The interviews were held in May 2005. Three of the interview panellists had to recuse themselves from the evaluation of Clara Cook because they were related to her. All seven participated in the questioning of Ms. Cramer and Ms. Deschambeault. Lisa Cook testified that she felt Clara Cook should not have been screened into the competition. The position had been advertised as being restricted to persons who had completed their Grade 12 high school diploma or equivalency. Clara Cook had not indicated in her resume having completed a Grade 12 education. Lisa Cook was, however, instructed to screen in all of the applicants, including Clara Cook.\n[24] After the candidates were interviewed, the interview panel met and tabulated its results. A handwritten summary or tally sheet documenting each interviewer\u2019s scores was filed in evidence. It shows that each assessor gave a score that ranked Ms. Deschambeault either first or tied for first with Ms. Cramer. All four of the panellists who assessed Clara Cook ranked her last or tied for second with Ms. Cramer. The overall average scores placed Ms. Deschambeault clearly first, with a score of 55 out of 70, Clara Cook second with 46 and Ms. Cramer with 42.\n[25] There were a number of apparent anomalies in the scoring. One interviewer, Ernest Chaboyer, gave Ms. Deschambeault a score of 74, even though the maximum possible score was 70. A review of Ernest Chaboyer\u2019s scoring sheets for each candidate that he interviewed shows that he entered a score for one of the interview questions at two spots on the scoring sheets, resulting in double entries. I note that he assigned Ms. Deschambeault full marks for all but one of the interview questions, where he gave 4\/5. This could suggest that his intended score for Ms. Deschambeault was 69\/70, much higher than his score for Ms. Cramer (25\/70). He did not rate Ms. Cook because she is his sister. Nevertheless, even if one were to remove all of Ernest Chaboyer\u2019s scores from the overall tabulations, the revised averages would still result in Ms. Deschambeault ranking first.\n[26] Another problem, highlighted by Raymond Chaboyer in his testimony, was that although the tally sheet contained scores from the elder who sat on the interview panel, he did not recall the elder actually asking any questions or entering any scores on his sheet. However, even if the elder\u2019s scores were also set aside, along with Ernest Chaboyer\u2019s, Ms. Deschambeault would still have ranked first.\n[27] Lisa Cook testified that the interview panel decided to recommend Ms. Deschambeault to the Band Council for the position. Ms. Deschambeault stated in her evidence that she received a telephone call that evening from Ernest Chaboyer informing her that she had scored highest and that the panel would be recommending her to Council. He even asked her when she would be available to begin working.\n[28] Ernest Chaboyer delivered a report of the panel\u2019s findings recommending Ms. Deschambeault, to a meeting of the Band Council the following day, May 16, 2005. After considering the matter, the Band Council passed a motion that Clara Cook be hired for the position, effective that date.\n[29] Ms. Deschambeault testified that she was very hurt and angered at being turned down a second time, especially after having been told the previous evening by Ernest Chaboyer that she had placed first in the panel\u2019s assessment and had been recommended for hiring. She felt it was not right for her to be turned down a second time after again having scored highest amongst all the candidates. In July 2005, she filed a human rights complaint with the Commission. She was advised by the Commission that the complaint required additional detail. Her modified complaint, which the Commission ultimately referred to the Tribunal and gave rise to the present case, was submitted to the Commission on February 14, 2006. The discriminatory conduct alleged in the complaint spans the period from July 22, 2004, to May 16, 2005, i.e., covering both the 2004 and the 2005 competitions.\nII. What are the legal principles applicable in this case? [30] It is a discriminatory practice under the CHRA to refuse to employ a person on the basis of national or ethnic origin (ss. 3 and 7).\n[31] A complainant must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination (Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28 (O\u2019Malley)). A prima facie case, in this context, is one that covers the allegations made and that, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent. Once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable and non-pretextual explanation for the otherwise discriminatory behaviour.\n[32] It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors in the employer\u2019s decision (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para 7 (F.C.A.); Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba [1995] 2 F.C. 569 (T.D.)).\n[33] In Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38481 (CHRT), the Tribunal stated that discrimination is not a practice that one would expect to see displayed overtly. Rarely are there cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practiced. A tribunal should therefore consider all circumstances to determine if there exists a subtle scent of discrimination.\n[34] In the employment context, the findings in a number of decisions have served to illustrate what type of evidence is needed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. In Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd., (1981), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 at para. 8918, the Ontario Board of Inquiry held that a prima facie case could be established by demonstrating:\nthat the complainant was qualified for the particular employment; that the complainant was not hired; and that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature, which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint, subsequently obtained the position.\n[35] In Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission, (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616 at 1618 (C.H.R.T.), aff'd (1984), 5 C.H.R.R. D\/2147 (C.H.R.T.- Rev. Trib.), the Tribunal modified this analysis to address situations where no appointment is made after the complainant who qualified for the position has been rejected and the employer continues to seek applicants.\n[36] While the Shakes and Israeli approaches serve as useful guides, neither one should be automatically applied in a rigid or arbitrary fashion in every hiring case (Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada (A.G.), 2005 FCA 154 (Morris) at paras. 23-30; Singh v. Canada (Statistics Canada) (1998), 34 C.H.R.R. D\/203 at para. 161 (C.H.R.T.); Premakumar v. Air Canada, 2002 CanLII 23561 at para. 77 (C.H.R.T.)). The circumstances of each case should be considered to determine if the application of either of the tests, in whole or in part, is appropriate.\nA. Has Ms. Deschambeault established a prima facie case of discrimination? [37] In my view, Ms. Deschambeault has established a prima facie case of discrimination with regard to both the 2004 and 2005 competitions. The evidence she and the Commission have led demonstrates that she was qualified for the facilitator position under both competitions, having been ranked first amongst all of the candidates being considered in each instance. She was not hired for the job both times. Finally, the evidence shows that someone no better qualified than she was (and in fact, less qualified according to the panels assessing the candidates on both occasions) was hired. These other persons who were hired lacked the distinguishing feature that is the gravamen of Ms. Deschambeault\u2019s complaint (i.e., they were not M\u00e9tis, but were First Nation members of the Cumberland Lake First Nation). The three components of the Shakes analysis have therefore been established.\n[38] The Band argues that Ms. Deschambeault\u2019s status as a non-Band member is not like the descriptors of race or ethnicity for the purposes of this analysis. The Band points out that unlike race, it is possible to gain or lose band membership status throughout one\u2019s lifetime. For instance, women who were not band members have acquired band membership by marrying a male band member. Others acquired their Indian status in 1985, through the enactment of Bill C-31 (An Act to Amend the Indian Act), which reinstated many individuals who had earlier lost their status.\n[39] I disagree. To begin with, the present complaint alleges discrimination on the basis of national or ethnic origin, not race. The CHRA provides that adverse differential treatment of individuals based on their national or ethnic origin constitutes a discriminatory practice. There is no distinction made in the CHRA between those persons who are discriminated against for being members of a particular national or ethnic group and those who are discriminated against for not being members of a particular group.\n[40] Ms. Deschambeault has established prima facie that she was denied an employment opportunity because she lacked a certain national or ethnic origin. She was not First Nation, and in particular, not a Cumberland House Cree Nation member. It should not make any difference that Ms. Deschambeault could have later acquired Indian status by marrying a Band member, for instance, any more so than to say, by analogy, that a victim of a discriminatory practice based on her religion could potentially convert to another religion at a later time. The fact that they were adversely differentiated at a given point on the basis of their then current status (be it actual or perceived national\/ethnic origin, religion, family status, sexual orientation, etc.) is sufficient to make a finding of discrimination.\n[41] The Band also appears to suggest that all of the candidates in both competitions were of the same national or ethnic origin, as both Indians and M\u00e9tis fall within the meaning of aboriginal peoples of Canada under s. 35(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982 (i.e., the Indian, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples of Canada). I gather that the Band would like the Tribunal to conclude from the language of this constitutional provision that there could therefore not have been any discrimination in the present case, although its submissions on this point were not very explicit.\n[42] To the extent that the Band is actually advancing this argument, I do not agree with it. That would constitute a far too restrictive definition of national or ethnic origin under the CHRA. First of all, as the Supreme Court noted in R. v Powley, 2003 SCC 43 at para. 10, the term M\u00e9tis in s. 35, while not encompassing all individuals with mixed Indian and European heritage, refers to distinctive peoples who, have a recognizable group identity separate from their Indian or Inuit and European forebears. Moreover, in a broader sense, the Band\u2019s argument appears to ignore the fact that the aboriginal peoples of Canada as referenced in the Constitution Act, 1982, are comprised of many nations or ethnic groups, possessing unique cultures, languages, traditions and history. It appears to suggest that adversely differentiating on the basis of these national or ethnic origins should be treated differently than differentiation between, for instance, European national origins as they have been historically defined. This is patently absurd.\n[43] In any event, the provisions of the CHRA do not require that a complainant and a respondent be of different national or ethnic origins in order for a complaint to be a substantiated. Section 4 of the CHRA states that anyone found to be engaging or to have engaged in a discriminatory practice may be subject to a Tribunal order. It is thus entirely possible for a Tribunal to find that an individual was a victim of discrimination at the hands of someone who is of the same origin, if it is established the victim\u2019s origin was a factor in the adverse differential treatment.\n[44] I therefore find that a prima facie case of discrimination has been established.\nB. Has the Band provided a reasonable explanation? (i) The 2004 Competition [45] The Band did not lead any evidence that could provide any explanation, let alone a reasonable one, to justify the prima facie case of discrimination that the Commission and Ms. Deschambeault established.\n[46] The Band called three witnesses at the hearing, Chief Walter Sewap, Angus Mackenzie, and Raymond Chaboyer. Chief Sewap was elected to his post in April 2005, just prior to the 2005 competition. He testified that he could not give any information regarding the 2004 competition because he was not on the Band Council at the time. Mr. Mackenzie was first elected to Council in April 2005. He did not provide any evidence regarding the 2004 competition.\n[47] Raymond Chaboyer was a member of the Band Council at the time of the 2004 competition. He did not sit on the interview panel that assessed the candidates for the facilitator position that year. This witness often confused the 2005 competition with the 2004 competition when giving his evidence. When ultimately pressed in cross examination to state who had placed first in the competition of 2004, he could not recall. When asked why the Band Council did not hire Ms. Deschambeault in 2004 despite her having been recommended by the interview panel, he could not remember, claiming it was too long ago. In the end, Raymond Chaboyer\u2019s evidence provided no explanation whatsoever for the decision not to hire Ms. Deschambeault in 2004, a decision that I have found was prima facie discriminatory.\n[48] In its final written submissions, filed after the hearing had ended, the Band made several arguments based on the documentary evidence regarding the 2004 competition. It pointed to a number of discrepancies in the scoring documents (questionnaires) regarding the 2004 competition that were filed in evidence. Some interviewers apparently wrote down scores for several of the questions while others did not. This allegedly resulted in certain applicants obtaining higher scores than others for no apparent reason. It was also alleged that one or more interviewers abandoned scoring on a scale of 1 to 4, and gave overall percentile rankings. Lisa Cook and another panellist allegedly gave more points to Ms. Deschambeault for not having a criminal record than to the other candidates. In addition, not all of the questionnaires were signed by the panel members.\n[49] These explanations are in my view simply pretextual, if not just mere afterthoughts on the part of the Band, produced in a belated effort to come up with an explanation. Most of these inconsistencies were never even raised with any of the witnesses. Lisa Cook was not asked any questions about why she allegedly scored the candidates\u2019 absence of any criminal backgrounds differently. The other inconsistencies were barely explored in the Band\u2019s cross examination of the Commission\u2019s witnesses. These points were certainly not broached with the Band\u2019s witnesses.\n[50] More importantly, no evidence was led in any way demonstrating that these alleged inconsistencies were even put before or considered by the Band Council in 2004 when it decided to reject the committee\u2019s recommendation and hire Ms. Cramer instead of Ms. Deschambeault.\n[51] The Band argued that Ms. Laliberte was mistaken in her evidence regarding a councillor who stated that a Band member should be preferred for hiring. The discussion, it is alleged, related to the appointment of a health director, not the facilitator. The Band also raised the possibility that other discussions were held at that council meeting to which Ms. Laliberte was not privy. I have no evidence, however, to support either assertion. There is no indication what those alleged other discussions were. The Band was not even able to produce the minutes that Ms. Laliberte recorded of that Council meeting. Thus, there is basically no evidence before me to contradict Ms. Laliberte\u2019s testimony.\n[52] In fact, I am left with no evidence whatsoever to explain why the Band made the decision not to hire Ms. Deschambeault, despite the interview panel\u2019s recommendation. I have already determined that a prima facie case of discrimination has been established. In the absence of any explanation, I find that Ms. Deschambeault\u2019s human rights complaint with regard to the 2004 competition has been substantiated.\n(ii) The 2005 Competition [53] Given my finding that Ms. Deschambeault\u2019s complaint with respect to the 2004 competition has been substantiated, discussion about the 2005 competition is in a sense moot. The facilitator\u2019s position for which she competed in 2004 was to have been for a two-year term. There is no evidence before me to suggest that Ms. Deschambeault would not have completed her term, had she been hired. Ms. Cramer resigned from the position for personal reasons about eight months after being hired. She claims that she felt compelled to leave because of an unhealthy work environment and harassment from one or more councillors. She felt that Council did not cooperate with her, partially because she was considered an activist and trouble-maker within the community. The Band argued that she simply quit in order to run for Council, as demonstrated by her decision to reapply for the same position in 2005 after she failed to win a seat. Whichever view best reflects reality, there is no reason to believe that Ms. Deschambeault would have resigned her post before the end of the term. Therefore, there would not have been any need for a competition in 2005.\n[54] Besides, I find that the Band\u2019s explanation for not hiring Ms. Deschambeault in 2005, in spite of the recommendation of the interview panel, is not reasonable on the evidence or is otherwise just a pretext to justify the discriminatory practice.\n[55] The Band argued that the role of the interview panel in 2005 was merely to provide the Band\u2019s council with a recommendation, which was not binding on the Band. Council was to reserve the right to come to its own decision regarding the successful candidate. Chief Sewap testified that Council had overruled other such hiring recommendations in the past, a point that was also confirmed by Lisa Cook.\n[56] However, in the context of the present human rights complaint, this argument is irrelevant. While it may be within the Band Council\u2019s discretion to appoint whomever it wishes, and even reject an interview panel\u2019s recommendation, it cannot do so on the basis of discriminatory grounds. If a prohibited ground constitutes even one of several factors in its decision, then the Band will have run afoul of the CHRA (see Holden, supra). Thus, it is unsatisfactory for a respondent to simply argue, in answer to a prima facie case of discrimination, that the ultimate decision rested with the Band Council and that it had every right in its discretion to hire whomever it wished. In the face of the evidence led in this case tending to show that the Complainant was the most qualified, it was incumbent on the Band to at least lead some evidence suggesting that Clara Cook was more qualified or otherwise explaining why she was selected over Ms. Deschambeault.\n[57] The Band alluded to the discrepancies in the 2005 scoring process referred to earlier (the total score of 74 on 70 given by Ernest Chaboyer and the elder\u2019s participation in the scoring). Raymond Chaboyer claimed he had difficulty accepting the scoring results. Chief Sewap said he had concerns as well. They both claimed that these concerns were factors in the Band Council\u2019s hiring decision. Yet, no further elaboration was given about the Council\u2019s deliberations. What factors were actually considered by Council? How were the candidates assessed if the interview panel\u2019s recommendations were discounted or discarded? When the discrepancies were identified, why did Council not send the matter back to the interview panel for reassessment? As I mentioned earlier, if the Band had concerns about the discrepancies, eliminating the scores affected by them would have still yielded the same result: Ms. Deschambeault would emerge as the clear leader, ahead of both Ms. Cramer and Clara Cook. So why was Clara Cook selected? Moreover, if the discrepancies gave rise to general doubts about the overall reliability of the process, on what basis did the Band actually make its decision to select Clara Cook over the others? No answer was provided to any of these questions in the evidence.\n[58] Raymond Chaboyer\u2019s evidence was particularly weak in this regard. He frequently confused the 2004 process (in which he would have not had any involvement other than as a councillor) with the 2005 process (in which he participated as an interview panellist and later as a member of Council). He professed to have no faith in the process, claiming that Lisa Cook had made up the questionnaires, which were just handed to him and the panellists. Lisa Cook and Chief Sewap testified, however, that the questions had been approved by the Band Council in advance. Raymond Chaboyer also testified that due to his lack of any faith in the process, he did not bother scoring anyone at all. However, the tally sheet with the panel\u2019s scores that was brought back to Council shows that Raymond Chaboyer did participate in the scoring. He acknowledged in cross examination that he did not remember if he scored people.\n[59] It should be noted, in passing, that Clara Cook is Raymond Chaboyer\u2019s sister. The tally sheet shows that he did not participate in the interview panel\u2019s scoring regarding her candidacy. There is no evidence of whether he recused himself from discussions at Council about her candidacy, but the minutes show that one unnamed councillor abstained.\n[60] The Band argued that while the memory of Raymond Chaboyer may have been less than perfect, there is nothing to suggest his credibility or honesty was compromised. The witness\u2019 honesty is not what is in issue here, however, but rather whether his testimony contributes any evidence to support the Band\u2019s answer to the prima facie case of discrimination. In this regard, his less then perfect memory seriously weakens his evidence such that very little weight can be assigned to it.\n[61] I am not persuaded by the Band\u2019s explanation regarding the impact of these scoring discrepancies. There is hardly any evidence before me to support the contention that they were even considered by Council in its decision. As I just explained, Raymond Chaboyer\u2019s testimony carries almost no weight. Chief Sewap\u2019s evidence in this regard is called into question by his failure to elaborate on how the alleged scoring discrepancies were dealt with by Council and what factors were in fact considered in deciding to hire Clara Cook. In my view, the Band\u2019s explanation has not been established.\n[62] Moreover, even if it were demonstrated that the Band Council did turn its mind to these scoring discrepancies, the questions about why Clara Cook was selected over Ms. Deschambeault remain unanswered, as I mentioned earlier. Thus, I find that the evidence about the scoring problems do not constitute a reasonable answer to the prima facie case of discrimination, which leads me to conclude that the Band has raised them simply as a pretext to justify the Band\u2019s discriminatory practice.\n[63] Ms. Deschambeault\u2019s complaint with regard to the 2005 competition has therefore also been substantiated.\nC. Is the Band\u2019s decision immune from the operation of the CHRA due to s. 67? [64] The Band contends that irrespective of my findings regarding the facts alleged in Ms. Deschambeault\u2019s complaint, its decision regarding the facilitator\u2019s position is immune from the operation of the CHRA, pursuant to s. 67, and that in turn, the matter at issue in this case falls beyond the jurisdiction of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. I am not persuaded by the Band\u2019s submissions in this regard.\n[65] Section 67 provides as follows:\nNothing in this Act affects any provision of the Indian Act or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act.\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi est sans effet sur la Loi sur les Indiens et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi.\n[66] It is common ground that the Cumberland House Cree Nation is a band within the meaning of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5. In order to invoke s. 67, a band must demonstrate that the sections of the CHRA that are engaged by the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into the complaint, will affect a provision of the Indian Act or a provision made under or pursuant to the Indian Act. The term provision made under or pursuant to the [Indian] Act in s. 67 encompasses any decision made under or pursuant to the Act (see Re: Desjarlais (1989), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/466 at para. 10 (F.C.A.)). In my view, the Band has failed to establish this link.\n[67] The Band argues that the facilitator\u2019s position was created for and directed at the health of the Band\u2019s members who have suffered from the legacy of the residential schools system. Such health concerns, it is contended, land squarely under the responsibility of the Band\u2019s Council, which has the authority to deal with such issues via the Indian Act. In particular, the Band refers to the authorities listed in s. 81(1) of the Indian Act, including the authority to provide for the health of residents on reserve (s. 81(1)(a)), and with respect to any matter arising out of or ancillary to the exercise of powers under s. 81(1) (s. 81(1)(q)).\n[68] This argument is, however, misleading. Section 81(1) does not set out the authorities of a band per se but rather the purposes for which a band may make by-laws. The list of purposes is set out in ss. 81 and following is quite extensive and wide ranging. It includes the above noted provision of health care to residents on reserve, but also the regulation of traffic, the observance of law and order, the construction and maintenance of roads, bridges and other local works, the survey and allotment of reserve lands, taxation and licensing of businesses, appropriation and expenditure of money, and many other areas. In the present case, there is no evidence that the Band adopted any by-law with respect to any of the decisions relating to the agreement with the Aboriginal Health Foundation and the decisions regarding the staffing of the facilitator position.\n[69] I do not agree with the Band\u2019s contention that its mere capacity to adopt by-laws with respect to these matters gives rise by implication to the s. 67 exception. The Federal Court of Appeal decision in Re: Desjarlais, supra at para. 12, suggests that at the very least, a by-law must have been adopted pursuant to ss. 81 and following of the Indian Act, to be relied upon by a band raising a s. 67 CHRA defence. There is an obvious rationale to this finding. Were each of the wide-ranging purposes listed in ss. 81 and following to constitute a provision within the meaning of s. 67 even where no by-law had been adopted, the effect would be to shield practically all band council decisions from the operation of the CHRA. Such an interpretation would not be consistent with the principle articulated in Zurich Insurance Co. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 321 at 339, that exceptions to human rights legislation must be narrowly construed.\n[70] As the Federal Court stated in Shubenacadie Band Council v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) (1997), 31 C.H.R.R. D\/347 at para. 29, aff\u2019d 2000 CanLII 15308 (F.C.A.), if it was Parliament's intention to immunize all decisions of Indian band councils from the overview of the CHRA, Parliament would have expressly so provided rather than enacting s. 67. Section 67 immunizes decisions authorized by the Indian Act and its regulations, but not all decisions made by Indian band councils.\n[71] The Band claimed that the Shubenacadie case can be distinguished from the present one because the government funded social assistance payments that had been denied to the complainants in that case were deemed to be customarily available to the complainants within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA and thus guaranteed to them. In the present case, it is argued, the Band had the authority under its agreement with the Foundation to fill the facilitator\u2019s position at its discretion. Ms. Deschambeault had no guaranteed right to the job. I fail to see the relevance of this distinction to the question of whether the Band can rely on s. 67.\n[72] In support of its submissions on s. 67, the Band relied on the findings of the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Gordon Band (Council), [2001] 1 F.C. 124 (Laslo). In my view, the Band\u2019s reliance is misplaced. In that case, the complainant was a status Indian who lived on the Gordon First Nation Band Reserve with her non-Indian spouse. Her request for housing from the band was denied and she filed a complaint alleging discrimination based on sex and family status. The respondent raised s. 67 of the CHRA in its defence. Just as in the present case, the Gordon Band had not adopted any by-law regarding the matter at issue there (i.e., allocation of housing), namely, a by-law pursuant to s. 81(1)(i), which authorizes the making of by-laws for the survey and allotment of reserve lands among band members.\n[73] The Federal Court of Appeal agreed with the Tribunal\u2019s finding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The Court held, at para. 26, that s. 67 applies to decisions that, by virtue of their subject matter, are within the authority expressly granted by a provision of the Indian Act. The band\u2019s decision in that case was found to be expressly authorized under s. 20 of the Indian Act. Section 20 provides that no Indian is lawfully in possession of land in a reserve unless, with the approval of the Minister, possession of land has been allotted to him by the council of the band.\n[74] The Court found that by necessary implication from the words of this provision, the band council had the authority under the Indian Act to decide at its discretion whether to allot land to a given band member. The recognition of this authority under s. 20 therefore necessarily implied that such decisions would be made under or pursuant to the Indian Act. That was the basis for the Court\u2019s decision in favour of the band in Laslo. I note, however, that the Court did not state that a band\u2019s mere capacity to pass by-laws under ss. 81 and following constitutes an expressly granted decision making authority under the Indian Act.\n[75] In contrast to Laslo, the Band in the present case has not identified to the Tribunal any similar provision in the Indian Act granting the Band express decision making authority relating to the staffing of the facilitator position in this case. The Band, in its final submissions, referred to its internal Regulations respecting the Personnel Management of Cumberland House Cree Nation Programs \/ Institutions \/Corporations, which the Band allegedly adopted pursuant to the inherent and legally recognized right of First Nations to function as employers. The Band argues that these regulations are evidence of a similar authority as considered in the Gordon matter. However, these regulations were never tendered in evidence before the Tribunal. More importantly, other than the Band\u2019s blanket contention of a similar authority as in the Gordon case, no link to any specific provision of the Indian Act has been identified as the source of this similar expressly granted decision making authority.\n[76] In sum, therefore, I am not persuaded that the Band Council\u2019s decision regarding the staffing of the facilitator position, under its agreement with the Aboriginal Health Foundation, was made pursuant to an authority expressly granted by a provision of the Indian Act. Consequently, the Band\u2019s claim for immunity under s. 67 of the CHRA has not been substantiated.\nIII. What remedies are Ms. Deschambeault and the Commission seeking?A. Lost wages (s. 53(2)(c)) [77] Section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA provides that a victim may be compensated for any and all wages that she was deprived of as a result of the discriminatory practice. Ms. Deschambeault testified that the annual salary for the facilitator\u2019s position was $40,000. The Band did not lead any evidence to the contrary. Had Ms. Deschambeault been hired in 2004, she would have worked six months in that year. Instead, she remained employed in her existing job at the Pine Island Health Centre, where she continued to earn a lower income. Her lost wages resulting from the Band\u2019s failure to hire her in 2004, therefore, are as follows:\n2004:\n-\n$20,000 (Facilitator salary for remainder of 2004). $11,250 (Income actually earned for remainder of the year) $ 8,750\n2005:\n-\n$40,000 (Facilitator\u2019s annual salary) $21,828 (Income actually earned) $18,172\n2006:\n-\n$20,000 (Facilitator salary until the end of the term) $14,063 (Income actually earned to the same date) $ 5,937\nTotal lost wages: $32,859\nThe Band is therefore ordered to pay Ms. Deschambeault the sum of $32,859 as compensation for lost wages.\nB. Expenses Incurred (s. 53(2)(c)) (i) Expenses related to training [78] A victim may be compensated for any expenses incurred as a result of a discriminatory practice (s. 53(2)(c)). According to the Band\u2019s agreement with the Aboriginal Health Foundation, the facilitator was to receive some training, described as 24 1-week train the trainer healing modules. Ms. Deschambeault claims that these modules would have provided her with sufficient education and training experience to maintain employment in any human services related field. Having been denied the opportunity to gain this training, she made the choice to leave her employment at the Pine Island Health Centre and move, in 2005, to Saskatoon where she enrolled in the Criminal Justice Program at Regency College. There was, however, also some indication in the evidence that her employment with the health centre would have ended in any event if she did not take steps to improve her academic qualifications. There had been a changeover in management and new employment policies had been adopted.\n[79] Ms. Deschambeault finished the program in 2006 and decided to follow up by completing the Addiction Counselling Diploma Program being given by the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology. This required that she move again, to Prince Albert this time.\n[80] Ms. Deschambeault is therefore claiming from the Band the expenses that she incurred relating to this training, including tuition, housing, and vehicle expenses. I am not persuaded, however, that the modules she would have followed as a facilitator are equivalent to the education that she has actually received since 2005, one that has enabled her to gain new employment, in 2008, at a health facility in Montreal Lake, Saskatchewan. Ms. Deschambeault very responsibly chose to turn the misfortune brought upon her by the Band into an opportunity to improve her academic qualifications and experience. For this, she must be commended. However, the expenses related to her decision are not as a result of the Band\u2019s discriminatory practices, within the meaning of s. 53(2)(a) of the CHRA. Consequently, she is not entitled to be compensated by the Band for these expenses.\n(ii) Other expenses [81] Ms. Deschambeault has incurred some expenses as a result of the discriminatory practices that led to the filing of her complaint. These include:\nPhotocopy costs $150.00\nAdministration costs, binders (i.e. stationery) $ 48.98\nTravel costs from the Northern Village of Cumberland House to Prince Albert and back to attend a mediation session (for herself and Ms. Cramer who accompanied her at the mediation) $547.60\nAccommodation and meals at the mediation $ 84.00\nTotal: $830.58\n[82] Ms. Deschambeault is entitled to be compensated by the Band for these expenses that she incurred as a result of the discriminatory practices leading to the filing of the present human rights complaint.\n[83] However, I am not persuaded, on the evidence, that the she incurred the costs that she is claiming regarding the rental of a laptop computer. This expense claim is denied.\n[84] In addition, there are no exceptional circumstances in this case to justify awarding Ms Deschambeault compensation for the time that she has spent preparing her case (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Lambie (1996), 29 C.H.R.R. D\/483 at para. 41 (F.C.T.D.).\nC. Pain and Suffering (s. 53(2)(e)) [85] A victim of a discriminatory practice may be compensated up to $20,000 for any pain and suffering that she experienced as a result. Ms. Deschambeault testified about the sadness and disappointment she felt at being turned down for a job that she longed to do and for which she felt herself more than competent to perform. It was particularly painful to learn that she was denied this opportunity because she was not a member of the Cumberland House Cree Nation. She also expressed disappointment that she was unable to contribute, as she felt she could, to the healing process within the community, which essentially includes both the Village and the reserve. Their residents not only share institutions like schools and arenas, they live side by side with each other, M\u00e9tis and First Nation alike, particularly within the Village. She testified that she no longer feels at home within the community in which she grew up.\n[86] In all of the circumstances, Ms. Deschambeault is entitled to be compensated for her pain and suffering in the amount of $8,000.\nD. Special compensation (s. 53(3)) [87] Section 53(3) provides that the Tribunal may order a respondent to pay up to $20,000 in compensation to the victim if the respondent is found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. In my view, there is evidence that the Band acted recklessly in committing the discriminatory practices in this case. It opted to deny Ms. Deschambeault the employment opportunity for which she otherwise was qualified and should have received \u2013 as the first ranking candidate \u2013 because she was not a Band member. No other reason was given in the evidence. The Band has maintained an attitude that it can do as it pleases, claiming that it has every right to appoint whomever it so chooses, as if it can function above the human rights of others.\n[88] In the circumstances, I order the Band to pay Ms. Deschambeault $5,000 in special compensation pursuant to s. 53(3).\nE. Interest [89] Interest is payable in respect of all the awards made in this decision (s. 53(4) of the CHRA). The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. The interest shall run from the date of the complaint with respect to the compensation for lost wages, pain and suffering and special compensation. The interest regarding the compensation for expenses, which were apparently incurred after the complaint was filed, will run from the date of this decision.\nF. An order for measures to redress the discrimination and prevent its recurrence (s. 53(2)(a)) [90] The Commission has requested an order pursuant to s. 53(2)(a) of the CHRA requiring the Band to work with the Commission to ensure that future hiring practices conform with the CHRA. Given my findings in this case, the order is warranted. The Commission\u2019s request is granted.\n[91] The Band is ordered to take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes thereof, to prevent the same or similar discriminatory practices from occurring in the future.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] On May 30, 2005, Evelyn London (the complainant) filed two complaints before the Canadian Humans Rights Commission. One complaint alleges that the New Brunswick Aboriginal Peoples Council (NBAPC) discriminated against her in violation of Sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act). The other complaint, filed against Barry LaBillois, the complainant's supervisor at NBAPC, alleges that he discriminated against her in violation of section 14 of the Act. Both complaints allege that the respondents engaged in a discriminatory practice on the ground of race, national or ethnic origin.\n[2] The respondents deny the complainant's allegations.\n[3] The parties were represented by legal counsel at the hearing. The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not attend the hearing.\nII. THE FACTS [4] The complainant is of both Maliseet and Micmac ancestry. Maliseet and Micmac are the two largest aboriginal communities in the province of New Brunswick.\n[5] The respondent, NBACP, was created in 1972. It represents off reserve or non status aboriginals and M\u00e9tis people of New Brunswick. The organization includes aboriginals of Micmac, Maliseet, Ojibway, Passamaquoddy and Cree ancestries. To become a member of NBAPC a person must self identify as an aboriginal person and provide documentation to establish his aboriginal origins. Non status aboriginals would have to provide a birth certificate establishing that one of their parents is of aboriginal ancestry.\n[6] NBAPC consists of locals comprising various communities of aboriginals living off reserve. According to its charter, a local of NBAPC can be established when five aboriginal members reside in a given geographical area. These individuals must not live more than ten kilometers apart. Various locals make up zones. There are seven zones in New Brunswick. Each zone elects a representative to the council of NBAPC. The president of the council is also known as the Chief. Betty Ann Lavallee has been president and Chief of NBAPC since 2000. The complainant was a member of NBAPC from late 1970 until 2002 when she gave up her membership.\n[7] Barry LaBillois is of Micmac ancestry and was, at all times relevant time to this matter, an employee of NBACP. More specifically, he occupied the position of Aboriginal Fisheries Coordinator.\n[8] The complainant was hired as a secretary\/bookkeeper with NBAPC for its Aboriginal Fisheries Program on June 19, 2000. Her job was to assist the Supervisor of the Aboriginal Fisheries Program. Between June 19, 2000 and August 2001, Phillip Fraser was her Supervisor.\n[9] In August 2001, after Phillip Fraser left NBAPC for other employment, the respondent, Barry LaBillois, took over the position of Supervisor. On January 24, 2002, the complainant was offered a position as Aboriginal Fisheries Monitor. Chief Lavallee testified that she had explained to the complainant that she would also hold the position of secretary\/bookkeeper until somebody could be found to fill that position. The complainant did not, at that time, raise any concerns about being supervised by Barry LaBillois.\n[10] The complainant stated that her working relationship with Barry LaBillois was not a good one. She added that he had told her that he was the boss and that she should do as she was told with no question asked. She also testified that before he became her supervisor, she had heard him make disparaging remarks against Maliseet but she was unable to say when these remarks had been made, except for one incident to which I will refer to later.\nA. The lobster distribution incident [11] The first incident the complainant specifically referred to as being harassment occurred in September 2001 during the preparation of lobsters for distribution to members of NBAPC. This incident happened outside of the workplace at the home of Carol LaBillois-Slocum, the sister of Barry LaBillois. Carol LaBillois-Slocum was then the communication officer of NBAPC. She now holds the position of vice-chief.\n[12] The complainant said that, as part of her job, Barry LaBillois had requested her to be present. Another coworker, Jason Harquail was also present. As were Carol LaBillois-Slocum, her husband and Barry LaBillois.\n[13] The complainant's task on that day was to cook the lobster and to put them in a walk-in cooling unit so that they would cool down.\n[14] According to the complainant, everybody present was drinking alcohol except her. She said that at one point, Carol LaBillois-Slocum pressured her into having a drink and even slapped her in the face telling her to get with it. Carol LaBillois-Slocum was present at the hearing when the complainant gave her evidence. She was also listed on the respondents' witness list but was never called as a witness.\n[15] At one point during the evening, while she was putting lobster in the walk-in cooling unit, Barry Labillois closed the door of the unit, locking her inside. The complainant said that she panicked and started beating on the door, yelling for someone to let her out. When asked if somebody else was inside the unit with her, she answered that she did not remember. According to her recollection, this incident, lasted for a couple of minutes. Eventually, Barry LaBillois opened the door and let her out. She added that he was laughing. The complainant did not say anything to him and headed inside the house.\n[16] During her cross-examination, the complainant testified that Mr. LaBillois had done this because she was a Maliseet and that this was leading up to what occurred later on in the evening. Barry LaBillois said that this was all done as a joke and that the complainant was not alone in the walk-in cooling unit but that Jason Harquail had also been locked in with her. He said that when the door was unlocked both the complainant and Jason Harquail were laughing it off. When asked about this, Jason Harquail said that he did not remember anything particular about that evening and he never referred to the cooling unit incident.\n[17] The complainant further testified that at one point during the evening, Barry LaBillois said that Maliseet were an inferior race and that they were slow and slow speaking. She said that she told him that he should not be saying things like that and that his response was it was true. But during her cross-examination, she agreed that this was the first time that she had mentioned that Barry LaBillois had replied to her comment and that since LaBillois alleged response that it was true had not been written in her complaint then the chances were that it had not been said.\n[18] Asked if he had made these comments, Barry LaBillois answered: I say it never happened. I never made any comments about Maliseet that evening.\n[19] The complainant never complained about these incidents to anyone at NBAPC. She explained that she was afraid to lose her job considering Barry LaBillois' position at NBAPC.\nB. Incidents at the workplace [20] The complainant also testified to various incidents which occurred at the workplace. She said that, on numerous occasions, Barry LaBillois would come out of his office and tell her that it was evident that Maliseet were inferior since he had read it on the Internet. Questioned further about these incidents, she specified that it had only happened once, during the year 2002 (she couldn't be more specific), after she had obtained the position of Aboriginal Fisheries Monitor.\n[21] The complainant also referred to an incident which occurred when Phillip Fraser was the supervisor. She said that Barry LaBillois had then made a remark about Maliseet in the presence of Mr. Fraser. She did not indicate what this remark was. On cross-examination, the complainant admitted that this matter had been resolved and dealt with.\n[22] Also on cross-examination, she mentioned remarks that Barry LaBillois made where he described Maliseet as slow speakers, stupid and incapable of following instructions. She added that these comments made her feel uncomfortable and that whenever she told him how she felt, this would only make matter worse. She testified that he would slam doors and make her work through her lunch hours. The complainant was not able to indicate when these incidents occurred and her testimony was the only evidence to support her allegations. She agreed that these incidents were never brought to the attention of her employer before July or August 2002.\n[23] The complainant also stated that Chief Lavallee had once referred to her as a Mal-i-Mic which she felt constituted discrimination. Chief Lavallee explained that she used this expression to refer to the fact that the complainant had both Maliseet and Micmac ancestry. Chief Lavallee also indicated that NBAPC's newsletter is named The Mal-i-Mic.\n[24] The complainant recalled other incidents where Barry LaBillois would throw things - erasers, pens, coffee cups - at her from his office in order to get her attention. She also said that he would refer to her as Eleanor or Magoo and not by her real name. She added that she had told him that she wanted to be called by her name, but that did not seem to make any difference. The complainant testified that she did not appreciate him calling her by those names. She further added that she had never heard him refer to other employees by any name other than their own. The complainant admitted that the fact that Barry LaBillois called her Eleanor did not constitute discrimination but that it was nonetheless humiliating. I note that Monique Myrshrall, a co-worker of the complainant, testified that Mr. LaBillois would call everybody by different names and that Ms Myrshrall would also refer to him as Bartholomew.\n[25] Monique Myshrall recalled another incident that occurred in a hotel room in Bathurst, New Brunswick. No dates were given for this incident. Monique Myshrall said that she had heard Barry LaBillois and Carol Labillois-Slocum say that the complainant was slow to learn and stupid. Barry LaBillois denied making these comments, which he attributed to his sister. Although these comments are humiliating and certainly highly inappropriate coming from a supervisor, nothing in Ms Myshrall's evidence indicates that they referred to the racial, national or ethnic origin of the complainant.\n[26] Barry LaBillois admitted that on occasion he had referred to Maliseet as muskrat eaters. He said that it was common knowledge along the Saint John River that Maliseet ate muskrat. He added that he thought this was funny and that he was just joking when he made the comments. Pushed a little further by the complainant's lawyer, he never directly denied making other comments which he was not asked to specify neither in direct nor in cross-examination. He added that they were all made in good humor. He also added that the complainant never told him that she did not like him making those comments.\nC. The office cleanup [27] Around May 31, 2002, everybody at NBAPC was asked to participate in a cleanup of the office. The complainant said that while she was outside tying up pieces of wood in the back of a truck, Barry LaBillois told her don't you know anything about tying down brushes. You Maliseet do not seem to know how to do much. She added that these comments made her feel worthless. Asked if somebody else had heard these comments, she said that Monique Myrshrall was just walking into the building when they were made, but she doubts that she was close enough to have heard them. Barry LaBillois testified that he didn't recall making any comments about Maliseet on that day.\nD. Personality test [28] Around mid-April 2002, Barry LaBillois went to Banff, Alberta, for a couple of days, to take a management course. While there, he picked up a questionnaire, which he claimed was as a personality test.\n[29] In May 2002, he required that all the employees under his supervision complete the questionnaire. After they had completed the questionnaire, he proceeded to review and rank them based on their answers. Some time later, according to the complainant, Jason Harquail, Monique Myrshrall and herself were met with Barry LaBillois to discuss the tests results. The complainant said that, in front of all her coworkers, Barry LaBillois told her that her results showed that she was the odd one and that she had no backbone. She added that these comments made her feel uncomfortable, but she did not say anything at that time. According to her, no other employees received negative reviews in this exercise. Neither the test results, nor the questionnaire were entered into evidence.\n[30] Monique Myrshrall, although she recalled having been administered the questionnaire, did not remember any comments made by Barry LaBillois regarding the complainant's test results.\nE. The moving of furniture [31] NBAPC bought a workstation for the complainant. The complainant was told by Barry LaBillois to assemble it, which she did. Afterwards, he told her that she might have forgotten that she was left-handed and that the desk had been put together on the wrong side. She was told to make the necessary adjustments.\n[32] Barry LaBillois also told the complainant to put the desk facing the back wall, which meant that the complainant would have her back to the front door. The complainant said that she did not feel safe with this arrangement because sometimes clients would come in a little upset and she would prefer facing them rather than having her back to them. Without the prior consent of Mr. LaBillois, the complainant and Monique Myrshrall decided to rearrange the orientation of the workstation. They swung the workstation around so that it would face the door and not the back wall. They felt that this arrangement was more workable and professional.\n[33] When Barry LaBillois returned to the office, he took a look at the new arrangement and yelled at the complainant to come into his office. According to the complainant, he then told her: What the hell do you think you are doing? I want the workstation to be put back as I had told you to. She said that she tried to explain to him why the changes had been made, but he did not want to hear any of this. Mr. LaBillois testified that he had never agreed to these changes.\n[34] Chief Lavallee also testified about this incident. She said that she knew that the office furniture had been moved around in spite of the fact that the employees had been told not to do it. She also had been advised by the chief of operation that one of the desks had been damaged. Chief Lavallee called Barry LaBillois in her office and asked him what he was going to do about it. She informed him that he was the supervisor and that if he gave orders to his employees and they were not obeying them, then he needed to take control of the situation.\nF. The last confrontation [35] Funding having ran out for the Fish Monitoring Program, all of the employees were laid-off on July 3, 2002.\n[36] The complainant was recalled to work on July 15, 2002 when new funding became available. She said that Barry LaBillois came to her house to inform her that she would be recalled. She added that he had also apologized for what his sister had done to her. According to the complainant, he was referring to an incident which had occurred in the conference room at some point in June 2002. The complainant was there having lunch with four or five individuals when Carol LaBillois-Slocum came in. When she saw the complainant, she said please let me know when Evelyn is not here eating any longer because I lost my appetite. Barry LaBillois was not present when these comments were made.\n[37] Barry LaBillois confirmed that he had made arrangements to go to the complainant's home. He said that the complainant and her husband had a car for sale and that he wanted to check it out. During that visit, he informed the complainant that funding for the program had been reestablished and that she would be recalled to work. At the hearing, Mr. LaBillois was not asked and never testified about the alleged incident between the complainant and his sister.\n[38] The complainant testified that she was disappointed when she learned that she was going to be recalled. She added that she did not want to go back to work at NBAPC because of the way she had been treated. But, nonetheless, she did return.\n[39] The last confrontation between the complainant and her supervisor occurred on July 17, 2002. On that day, the complainant was instructed by Barry LaBillois to contact NBAPC's fishers to inform them of a Department of Fisheries and Oceans variance order. She said that she went down the list of fishers but was unable to contact any of them. She then went to Barry LaBillois' office and told him that she was unable to reach the fishers. According to her, Barry LaBillois blew up, started swearing at her and told her to go back to work and do as she had been told. He then told her to get out of his fucking office.\n[40] In a letter of complaint she wrote to Chief Lavallee on August 23, 2002, the complainant was more explicit about the exchange she had with her supervisor on that day. She wrote:\nI went into Barry's office after lunch to inform him of the results of the phone calls [...] He cut me off short and stated to me on what he wanted done. I tried again to make him aware of the outcome of what he wanted done and he cut me off again. He again continued to state on what he wanted done. I said I know what you wanted done, I only want to let you know how it is going with it. So I finally got the nerve and asked him if he has a problem with me. Barry said sit down, if I didn't want to hear what he had to say to get the fuck out of his office. I again said it seems to me that clearly there is a problem with me and I want to know what it is (as I was closing the door for privacy). He said there were a lot of things. He then said I had been always defying his authority by moving the office desk around. I said it wasn't my idea. He said I told you how I wanted to have the desk. I said that was all ready taken care of a long time ago. He said What about talking to Betty Ann. I said I hardly talk to her, do you want me to sit in the smoke room and say nothing in the mornings while there is only her and I there. We then got back to what the outburst was about. He started by saying If I wanted to ask questions, everyone has the opportunity to ask questions at the end of staff meetings, I said how will I know about what you want me to do if I can't ask questions on it? He started to calm down and explained to me that he has been upset. He then talked to me in a more relaxed manner. The screaming match was over. I found out what I needed to know and went back into my office.\n[41] Chief Lavallee, in her evidence, confirms that on the morning of July 17, 2002, she had instructed Barry Labillois to get in touch with the NBAPC's fishers and to get them off the water. On that same morning, while she was smoking a cigarette, she said she overheard the complainant and Monique Myrshrall talking in the smoke room. According to her evidence, they were making derogatory remarks about Barry LaBillois. They felt that he did not know what he was doing and that they should not have to call the individual fishers. Chief Lavallee called Barry LaBillois to her office and told him he had to get a grip on his employees. She told him that she was not impressed with the conduct of his employees and that he was not behaving as a supervisor should behave.\n[42] According to Barry LaBillois, after his meeting with Chief Lavallee, he returned to his office. He added that he then called the complainant into his office and told her that she had to contact the individual fishers. The complainant told him that she had tried but could not reach some of them. Mr. LaBillois said that he told her to keep trying because it was important that they be told about the situation on that day. They argued back and forth, until the point where Barry LaBillois blew up: I had enough of it and basically lost it and told her to get the fuck out of the office. He added that he did not have any other interaction with the plaintiff after she left his office.\n[43] At the hearing, the complainant testified that when she left Mr. LaBillois' office she did not return to her workstation but went upstairs to speak to Chief Lavallee. She added that this was the first time that she had decided to talk to Chief Lavallee about the incidents with her supervisor. When she got there, Chief Lavallee was busy on the phone and she was asked to return after lunch. At the hearing, she testified that this had happened in the morning and that her first attempt to speak with Chief Lavallee occurred also in the late morning. But I note that in her letter of August 23 she states: Being employed only for my second day Barry [LaBillois] and we had our last confrontation after lunch. I had a scheduled appointment with the Chief after lunch, she was to let me know when she was free as she was on direct inquiries (phone) that noon hour but before the meeting my supervisor and I had it out. This last outburst led me to take the matter to Chief Betty Ann [Lavallee]. (The emphasis is mine.).\n[44] The recollection she has of the event in her letter is a little different than what she testified to at the hearing. First of all, she indicates in her letter that the confrontation with her supervisor occurred after lunch, while she testified at the hearing that it had happened before lunch. On cross-examination, she admitted she should have written before lunch. Nothing much really depends on this, but other discrepancies appear more significant. For example, in the letter, she refers to a scheduled appointment with Chief Lavallee. In her letter she also wrote: I had verbally reported the conduct to Chief Betty Ann Lavallee of Barry's actions although that wasn't my intention for setting up the meeting with her. (The emphasis is mine.)\n[45] At the hearing, the complainant did not refer to a scheduled appointment, leaving the impression that her meeting with the Chief was spontaneous and due to the incident with her supervisor. Since the letter was written about a month after the events, I find it more convincing and credible than what was said at the hearing.\n[46] The complainant did eventually meet with Chief Lavallee after lunch. During her direct examination, she said that she related to Chief Lavallee Barry LaBillois' attitude towards her. More specifically, she said that she told Chief Lavallee that Barry LaBillois had referred to Maliseet as being inferior. She added that she tried to explain the other incidents but just broke down. Seeing that she was upset, Chief Lavallee told her to go home for the rest of the week and get some rest. The complainant testified that Chief Lavallee told her that she would contact Barry LaBillois to see what was going on, although, according to the complainant, Chief Lavallee never suggested that there should be a meeting between her, the Chief and Barry LaBillois. The complainant added that if such a meeting had been proposed, she would have accepted immediately.\n[47] Regarding her exchange with Chief Lavallee she wrote in her letter: By the time I got to her office I was upset by the outburst with Barry [...]. Betty Ann asked me what was wrong. I started by asking if the offer was still there to be let go. I broke down at that point sobbing unable to say anything. I had said to Betty Ann that I feel that Barry is not very professional and I never had to work for someone like that before. He was not like that in the beginning. He has been making derogatory remarks about me as a Maliseet. At the time we were cooking for the lobster distribution around the province. I said to Barry that I was insulted by his remarks and that he was not only insulting me but my whole family. I had thought that would have been it but it didn't stop there. ... I asked if the offer to be let go from work was still available. That was the reason I wanted the meeting with her. (The emphasis is mine.)\n[48] According to Chief Lavallee, the complainant did not seem distressed at the start of their meeting. She recalled that the complainant sat down and asked her if she could take the offer of an early lay-off. When asked why, Chief Lavallee said that she started to say something about Barry. Chief Lavallee then told her that she had told Mr. LaBillois to call the fishers and get them out off the water. At that point the complainant started to cry. Chief Lavallee said that she then asked the complainant if she could bring Barry LaBillois up and the complainant refused. She added that every time she suggested that they sit down with Barry LaBillois to discuss the matter, the complainant would say no. This contradicts the evidence given by the complainant who testified that if it had been suggested that they all meet together, she would have accepted.\n[49] Seeing that the complainant was distraught, Chief Lavallee told her that it might be a good idea for her to go home and take the rest of the week off. The Chief told her that she would be talking to Barry LaBillois and that in the coming weeks they would all sit down and work things out.\n[50] Later on in the afternoon of July 17, Chief Lavallee informed Barry LaBillois of what had happened.\n[51] On July 22, 2002, the complainant said that she called Chief Lavallee to see what follow up had been made. She was told that Chief Lavallee had not yet spoken to Barry LaBillois. She added that she then told Chief Lavallee that she did not feel comfortable returning to work until the issues with her supervisor had been addressed. According to the complainant's evidence, Chief Lavallee told her that she would prepare her record of employment on which she would indicate that she was being laid off because of a lack of funding.\n[52] Chief Lavallee has a slightly different recollection of what happened on that Monday, July 22. She agreed that the complainant was supposed to call her but testified that she never did. Chief Lavallee first testified that she called the complainant on Wednesday, July 24, 2002, but a little later she conceded and said that it was the complainant who called her on that day. During that conversation, Chief Lavallee said that the complainant again told her that she did not want to talk to Barry Labillois. The complainant again requested that she be given her lay-off. Chief Lavallee had the complainant's Record of Employment prepared. The reason given for her lay-off was: Agreement with DFP re aboriginal fishery has not been signed therefore no money for this program.\n[53] On August 23, 2002, the complainant wrote a letter to Chief Lavallee. In this letter she mentions that she left her work because of a hostile workplace in which she had been the subject of discrimination and derogatory remarks made by her supervisor. She referred specifically to incidents where she alleges Mr. LaBillois said the following: that's a Maliseet for you, Maliseet are inferior, only a Maliseet would do that. She also referred to the throwing of objects and to the fact that her supervisor would call her by the nickname Eleanor. The complainant also mentioned the incident concerning the rearrangement of the office and the events leading up to the last confrontation.\n[54] Chief Lavallee said that the complainant's letter of August 23, 2002, was her first contact with her since July 2002. After she received the letter, she called Barry LaBillois to her office to inform him that she had received a complaint. She had a conversation with Barry LaBillois about the content of the letter. She told him that she was not impressed with the situation and that if he had done is job right, this situation would not have degenerated. She also told him that this was why supervisors needed to be firm with employees and make sure that they followed rules and procedures.\n[55] On August 26, 2002, Barry LaBillois wrote a letter to Chief Lavallee responding to the complainant's letter. In this letter, he claims to answer all the allegations made by the complainant. In regards to the comments he is alleged to have made at the lobster distribution event, he does not deny making them. What he says in the letter is: Ms London did not indicate at any time that she had a problem with this. If Ms London had a problem this was the first time that I had heard anything about it. Within aboriginal groups across this country this is a common occurrence as we back and forth joke to one another to who is superior. When the topic was first mentioned Ms London should have [taken] the opportunity to say something at that time, [but] she did not do it till a year later. I can only apologize on this over site [sic] on my part. It was not in my [intention] to insult her or her family.\n[56] On September 10th, 2002, Chief Lavallee sent a disciplinary letter to Barry LaBillois. In that letter she writes: As discussed, September 10th, 2002, at approximately 11:00 a.m. in a meeting between me and you, I told you I would be giving you a written reprimand for using foul language at or around Ms London. Also, we discussed that you are not to call any employees by any other name, except their given name, objects are not to be thrown around office or at each other whether or not it is in fun, and lastly, you will not joke with employees about their tribal affiliations. She explained at the hearing that she was handing him a reprimand for using foul language because he had admitted to cursing and yelling. She also added that he had admitted to making jokes about the complainant's Maliseet ancestry, about throwing things in the office and about calling her Eleanor. In her letter, she further stated:\nYou have admitted and have taken responsibility for your actions and have assured me that this type of behavior will not occur again [...] Mr. LaBillois, both myself and the Deputy Vice-Chief, Barbara Cameron are very upset and disappointed with your conduct. Be forewarned if this sort of conduct or offensive behavior is to occur in the future with any employee of the New Brunswick Aboriginal Peoples Council, we the Executive of NBAPC will have no choice except to take more drastic steps.\nThe complainant said that she never saw this letter before the present procedures. Chief Lavallee added that she did not feel it proper to inform the complainant about this reprimand as she felt it would have been a breach of confidentiality.\n[57] Chief Lavallee further testified that she was not convinced that Barry LaBillois' actions were done to hurt the complainant, but she wanted by this reprimand to set the bar high for the future.\n[58] On December 18, 2002, the complainant filed a complaint with the New Brunswick Human Rights Commission, believing that it had jurisdiction over this matter. The complaint was ultimately transferred to the Canadian Human Rights Commission on May 30, 2005.\n[59] On February 27, 2003, the complainant received a letter from Chief Lavallee informing her that funding was now in place for the Aboriginal Fisheries Program, and that she could return to her position as an Aboriginal Fisheries Monitor as of March 10, 2003. The letter also indicated that the funding commitment was only available until the end of March 2003. On March 6, 2003, the complainant wrote to Chief Lavallee indicating that she would not accept this offer because her issues with Barry LaBillois had still not been addressed.\n[60] On March 7, 2003, Chief Lavallee wrote back to the complainant indicating that NBAPC had taken steps to investigate her complaint and that it had enacted the necessary disciplinary measures as a result. She added that NBAPC had also reiterated [its] policy that there is to be no joking, conversation or remarks of a personal nature in the office. I am confident that if you return to work with NBAPC that you will not be subject to any human rights issues or violations. Chief Lavallee also wrote that part of the difficulty the complainant had described as a hostile work environment was in fact a problem of interpersonal communication in the office. She added: I can only reiterate my request to all staff that we treat each other with respect at all times. She concluded her letter by again extending her offer of employment but she added if my assurances are not enough to satisfy you, and you choose not to return, then I have no choice but to consider you to have fully and finally resigned from employment at NBAPC. If this is the case, I will prepare a Record of Employment reflecting your decision to leave.\n[61] The complainant alleges that this offer of employment was made in retaliation to the filing of her complaints. Chief Lavallee answers that it had nothing to do with the human rights complaints but with the fact that an agreement had been concluded with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans concerning funding and that all the employee were recalled back to work. I note that the complainant never raised any issue concerning retaliation in her complaint.\n[62] The complainant never returned to work at NBAPC.\nIII. THE LAW [63] The complainant alleges that the respondents discriminated against her in within the meaning of sections 7 and 14 of the Act. Section 7 provides that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Paragraph 14(1)(c) of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination in matters related to employment. The prohibited grounds of discrimination include race, national or ethnic origin. In the present case, the complainant alleges that the respondents discriminated against her on the basis of her Maliseet ancestry. Whether or not the issue of the complainant's Maliseet ancestry qualifies as national or ethnic origin for the purposes of s. 3 of the Act was never challenged by the respondents.\n[64] Given that the allegations that NBAPC discriminated against the complainant in the course of her employment arise solely from her complaints under section 14, I will deal with the issue of section 14 first and, if necessary, address afterwards the allegations under section 7.\n[65] Harassment that is proscribed under the Act can take many forms. In this case, the complainant alleges that she was harassed because of her race, national or ethnic origin. The case law has established that for a complaint to be substantiated, it is not necessary for harassment to be the sole reason for the actions complained of for a complaint to be substantiated and the harassment need not even be intentional on the part of the perpetrator.(See Swan c. Canada (Armed Forces) (1994), 25 C.H.R.R.D.\/ 312 at para. 73 (C.H.R.T.), rev'd on other grounds (1995), 25 C.H.R.R.D.\/333 (F.C.T.D.); Dhanjal v. Air Canada, (1996), C.H.R.R. D\/27 at para. 206 (C.H.R.T.), aff'd [1997] F.C.J. No. 1599 (F.C.T.D.) (Q.L.); Marinaki v. Canada (Human Resources Development), [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 2 at para. 187 (C.H.R.T.) (Q.L.); Rampersadsingh v. Wignall, [2002] C.H.R.D. n\u00b0 27, at para. 40).\n[66] In the case of Canada (HRC) v. Canada (Armed Forces) and Franke, [1999] 3 F.C. 653 at paras. 29-50 (F.C.T.D.) (Franke) (also applied in cases of racial harassment, see Rampersadsing, supra; Morin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 41, at para. 246), the Federal Court stated that in order for a complaint of harassment to be substantiated, the following must be demonstrated:\nThe acts that are the subject of the complaint were unwelcome. This can be determined by assessing the complainant's reaction at the time of the alleged incidents of harassment and whether the complainant expressly, or by his\/her behavior, demonstrated that the conduct was unwelcome. The appropriate standard against which to assess a complainant's conduct will be that of a reasonable person in the circumstances. Where the complainant alleges that there has been harassment practiced on the basis of her national or ethnic origin, the respondent's conduct must somehow be shown to be related to that ground. Harassment can be verbal in nature, encompassing conduct such as insults or remarks regarding a person's national or ethnic origin. The Tribunal's determination of whether the unwelcome conduct was related to a complainant's origins should again be carried out in accordance with the standard of a reasonable person in the circumstances of the case, keeping in mind the prevailing social norms. (Rampersadsingh, supra, at. para 41.) Ordinarily, harassment requires an element of persistence or repetition, but in certain circumstances even a single incident may be severe enough to create a hostile environment. The Court in Franke noted, for example, that a physical assault may be serious enough to constitute in itself sexual harassment. On the other hand, a crude joke, although in poor taste, will not generally be enough to constitute sexual harassment and would rarely create a negative work environment. The objective reasonable person standard is used to assess this factor as well. The final factor arises where a complaint is filed against an employer regarding the conduct of one of its employees. Fairness requires that in such cases, the victim of the harassment, whenever possible, notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct\nIV. ANALYSIS OF THE FACTS [67] Human rights decisions hold that the initial burden lies with the complainant, who must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Once a prima facie case is established, it is usually said that the respondent has the burden of explaining. (Hill c. Air Canada, [2003] C.H.R.D. N\u00b03.)\n[68] I find that even if I was to accept that the facts of the case are in accordance with the evidence led in support of the complaint, the respondents' conduct does not constitute harassment on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, within the meaning of the Act. I have no doubt that the complainant was bothered and annoyed by Barry LaBillois' behavior, but his conduct does not meet the standard established in law for the proscribed form of harassment.\n[69] In order to explain this conclusion, I will now apply the criteria set out in Franke to the present case.\nA. Was the Impugned Conduct Related to the Complainant's race, or national or ethnic Origin? [70] I will address each of the situations where the complainant alleges that Barry LaBillois or NBAPC harassed her on the basis of the fact that she was a Maliseet.\n(i) The lobster distribution incident [71] During that September evening of 2001, the complainant alleges that the respondent, Barry LaBillois, discriminated against her because of her Maliseet origin. She referred to two incidents in particular: when he locked her in the walk-in cooling unit, and when he told her that Maliseet were an inferior race and slow and slow speaking.\n[72] As to the cooler incident, although it might suggest a lack of maturity on the part of Mr. LaBillois, I fail to see how this incident can be related to the complainant's race or national or ethnic origin and will exclude it from further consideration for the purpose of this decision.\n[73] In regards to the other incident where Mr. LaBillois is alleged to have said that Maliseet were an inferior race and that they were slow and slow speaking. Mr. LaBillois testified that these comments were never made.\n[74] Both the complainant and Barry LaBillois admitted that the respondent's sister, Carol LaBillois-Slocum, was present when these comments were made. Ms LaBillois-Slocum was on the respondents' witness list up to the last moment. Very late in the proceeding, counsel for the respondents informed the Tribunal that she would not be calling her as a witness. I will draw the inference from this that this potential witness would have confirmed that these comments had been made. Also, I note that in his letter of August 26, 2002, Barry LaBillois does not deny making these comments. He only indicates that the complainant had not at the time indicated that she had a problem with this. I therefore accept the complainant's evidence that Barry LaBillois made the comments attributed to him on that evening.\n(ii) Incidents at the workplace [75] During her evidence, the complainant referred in a general manner to incidents at the workplace during which she alleges the respondent, Barry LaBillois, made comments about Maliseet. She could not indicate when these remarks were made and what was said. She did, though, refer to an incident that happened in front of her former supervisor, Phillip Fraser, but also admitted that this matter had been dealt with and resolved.\n[76] She also testified to the fact that Barry LaBillois had described Maliseet as slow speakers, stupid and of being incapable of following instructions. She could not recall the specific times when these remarks were made, nor in what context they were made. Considering the vagueness of these allegations, I can understand that it is rather difficult for the respondent, to produce a reply.\n[77] Monique Myrshrall testified to an incident in a hotel room in Bathurst where Barry LaBillois and his sister are alleged to have said that the complainant was slow to learn and stupid. The complainant never referred to this incident in her complaint or in her evidence at the hearing. Barry LaBillois denied making these comments, which he attributed to his sister. Be that as it may, as humiliating and inappropriate as these comments can be, I see nothing in them that would refer to the complainant's race, national or ethnic origin.\n[78] Barry LaBillois would only admit to referring to Maliseet as muskrat eaters. The complainant never referred to this in her complaint. This being the case, I cannot see these comments as being part of the complainant's complaint.\n[79] Finally, I cannot draw any inference of discrimination from the incidents described as the throwing of objects in the office or the calling of names. These incidents might be characterized as childish and immature, on the part of the supervisor, but no evidence was submitted to establish that they were done with the intention to discriminate on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin.\n[80] On another issue concerning a comment made by Chief Lavallee, the complainant alleges that she was discriminated against when Chief Lavallee referred to her as a Mal-i-Mic. Chief Lavallee explained in the evidence that she was just referring to the complainant's dual origin. I note also that NBAPC's newsletter is called the Mal-i-Mic. I cannot see any discrimination in Chief Lavallee's use of this expression.\n(iii) The office cleanup [81] The complainant alleges that Barry LaBillois made disparaging remarks against Maliseet on that day. She testified that, seeing that she could not tie down some pieces of wood, he said You Maliseet do not seem to know how to do much. Barry LaBillois denies having made these comments. Nobody else heard this exchange. For the sake of argument, I will accept that these comments were made.\n(iv) Personality test [82] The complainant alleges that her supervisor discriminated against her when, after administering a personality questionnaire to her he stated that she was the odd one and that she had no back bone and that these comments could be attributed to discrimination on his part. She added also that these remarks had been made in front of her colleagues. Neither Monique Myshrall, a witness for the complainant, nor Jason Harquail, a witness for the respondents, could recall any comments made by Barry LaBillois to the complainant regarding her test results.\n[83] Again, nothing in these remarks refers to the complainant's race, national or ethnic origin. They are a clear indication of the interpersonal difficulties that existed between the complainant and her supervisor, but they cannot be interpreted as being discriminatory.\n(v) The moving of furniture [84] The evidence as not convinced me how this can be seen as being discriminatory on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin.\n(vi) The last confrontation [85] Going over the whole of the evidence of what happened on that last day, nowhere did I find comments uttered by the respondents regarding the complainant's race, national or ethnic origin. There were a lot of I said\/She said exchanges, some foul language was used, but the evidence does not convince me that it was partly based on the issue of race, national or ethnic origin. The stress level at the workplace seemed to be very high on that day and the interpersonal problems between the complainant and her supervisor reached their highest peak. What we have is a supervisor (LaBillois) who had been told by his superior (Lavallee) to execute a certain task in a certain manner and an employee (the complainant) who thought that this was not the proper course to follow. She wanted to argue the issue with her supervisor who at one point just blew up and used inappropriate, but not discriminatory, language.\n[86] I cannot conclude that what happened on that last day was in any way related to the complainant's race, or her national or ethnic origin discrimination under the Act.\n(vii) Conclusion [87] In summary, I conclude that the only incidents which could be linked to the complainant's racial, national or ethnic origin are the comments made at the lobster cook-out, where Barry Labillois stated that Maliseet were inferior and slow and slow speakers and the comment made during the cleanup where he said You Maliseet do not seem to know how to do much.\nB. Was the Impugned Conduct Unwelcome? [88] It is difficult to answer this question considering the fact that, according to the evidence, only two or three incidents could clearly refer to conduct that would be discriminatory on the basis of the complainant's race, national or ethnic origin. But nonetheless, I intend to deal with this issue. I explained earlier that in order to determine whether the respondents' conduct was unwelcome, I needed to assess the complainant's reaction at the time of the alleged incidents and whether the complainant expressly, or by her behavior, demonstrated that the conduct was unwelcome.\n[89] The complainant's evidence established that, at the lobster cook-out when Barry LaBillois made the comments, she did reply that he should not be saying this and that he was not only insulting her but also her whole family. Certainly her reaction at that time was indicative that the comments were not welcome. Regarding the cleanup incident, there is no evidence that she replied to the comments at that time.\n[90] Be that as it may, I will accept that the comments made by the respondent, Barry LaBillois, on both occasions, were unwelcome.\nC. Was the Impugned Conduct Serious or Repetitive Enough? [91] I find that the respondent's conduct was not repetitive enough, nor of a sufficient severity to constitute the type of harassment proscribed by the Act. In effect, according to the evidence submitted at the hearing, the respondent conduct that I have found to be related to the complainant's race, national or ethnic origin is limited to two events spread out over two years. The other events or comments referred to at the hearing cannot be viewed as harassment. They do establish a real problem of interpersonal relationship and maybe a lack of maturity and discipline in the workplace, but they cannot be considered under s. 14 since they are unrelated to the prohibited grounds invoked in this case.\n[92] As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Inc [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at page 1282, in order to come to a finding of harassment, it must be demonstrated that the conduct of a respondent was such as to have detrimentally affected the work environment. A certain level of seriousness or repetition in the conduct is required for such a hostile or poisoned environment to develop. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal pointed out, in Pitawanakwat v. Department of Secretary of State (1992), 19 C.H.R.R. D\/110 at paras. 40-42 (C.H.R.T.), rev'd on other grounds [1994] 3 F.C. 298, (1994) 21 C.H.R.R. D\/355 (F.C.T.D.). as well as in Dhanjal, supra and Rampersadsingh, supra, that when the impugned conduct takes the form of racial slurs, jokes in bad taste and stereotyping, it must be persistent and frequent or severe in order to constitute harassment. An isolated racial slur, even one that is very harsh, will seldom by itself constitute harassment within the meaning of the Act.\n[93] It was further noted in Dhanjal, at para. 215 that:\nIn short, the more serious the conduct the less need there is for it to be repeated, and, conversely, the less serious it is, the greater the need to demonstrate its persistence in order to create a hostile work environment and constitute racial harassment.\n[94] The same issue was dealt with by the Court of Appeal of Quebec in the case of Habachi v. Commission des droits de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec, [1999] R.J.Q. 2522, R.E.J.B. 1999-14361, [1999] J.Q. No. 4269 (Q.L.) (C.A.Q.). The Court recognized that a single act, provided it is serious enough and has an ongoing effect, may constitute harassment. But the Court also pointed out that if one were to conclude that acts lacking the requisite severity nevertheless constitute harassment, the effect would be to trivialize a provision of the Act that was intended to deal with a very specific form of discrimination.\n[95] As ill-advised as Barry LaBillois' conduct may have been, it was of limited duration and severity. It was limited to two incidents, maybe three if we add the one that occurred when Phillip Fraser was supervisor, but which the complainant identified as having been resolved. There is no question that the complainant and the respondent, Barry LaBillois, had interpersonal problems which could have had a negative effect on the working environment, but I am not convinced that, with the exception of two to three isolated incidents, these problems had any connection with the complainant's race, or national or ethnic origin.\n[96] The evidence establishes that the incidents where comments were made about the complainant's race, national or ethnic origin occurred on not more than on two or three occasions. The other incidents - the throwing of objects, referring to the complainant as Eleanor, the yelling matches, the use of foul language, the questionnaire - probably demonstrate a lack of professionalism on Barry LaBillois' part, but they are far from being related to her race, national or ethnic origin. I find that a reasonable person would not perceive these acts as having contributed to the severity, persistence or the duration of the two or three incidents that I have found to be connected to proscribed grounds.\n[97] The fact that the complainant felt compelled to cease working at NBAPC is not an indication that a poisoned work environment had developed within the meaning of s. 14. There is no doubt, as I have already repeatedly pointed out, that the complainant and Barry LaBillois had an antagonistic relationship, and that this was a factor in her decision to stop working there. However, it is also noteworthy that the complainant never once, during the time that she worked at NBAPC, other than after the incident of July 17, 2002, mentioned to Chief Lavallee-- or to any other persons -- the difficulties she was having working with her supervisor. The complainant even accepted to return to work with NBAPC in July 2002. Ultimately, the focus of the analysis must return to the respondents' specific conduct. I am satisfied that a reasonable person would not conclude that a poisoned or hostile work environment developed as a result of incidents related to utterances about the complainant's racial, national or ethnic origin.\n[98] As to NBAPC's conduct in this situation, it is impossible to criticize their reactions, since they were never officially made aware that there was a problem. For most of the relevant period, the complainant never notified a person in authority of her supervisor's conduct, but when she finally did in August 2002, Chief Lavallee reacted appropriately and asked Barry LaBillois to give an explanation of what had occurred. After having reviewed the matter, the council decided, in September 2002, to give him a written reprimand for the use of foul language, and it firmly indicated that it would not accept anymore bantering in the workplace. It also indicated clearly that employees of NBAPC should refrain from making jokes or comments about each other's national or ethnic ancestry. I am satisfied that NBAPC acted reasonably once it was made aware of the incidents.\n[99] I agree that when the complainant's allegations of discrimination and harassment were brought to the attention of NBAPC, it raised a duty to investigate and correct any problems in the workplace. I do not agree, however, with the complainant's arguments that NBAPC failed in its duty of due diligence. I accept that its attempts to deal with the issues raised by the complainant once NBAPC was made aware were real and substantive.\nV. CONCLUSION [100] In conclusion, I find that Barry LaBillois\u0092 conduct was at times offensive, rude and inappropriate, and that there is no question that the complainant was annoyed by his conduct. But as the Tribunal stated in Rampersadsingh, supra, at para. 60, Discouraging and preventing persons from ever directing pejorative or insulting comments to each other, particularly when such expressions are related to one of the proscribed grounds of discrimination under the Act, is a laudable goal. However, the provisions in the Act regarding harassment are not intended to sanction brief or sporadic conduct of this nature.\nVI.

The Complainants [1] Graham Forward and Evan Forward are the complainants in this case. They are brothers. Both were born outside Canada in the United States and are American citizens.\n[2] Graham Forward was born in 1982 and has always lived in the United States except between 2000 and 2004 when he attended Mount Allison University in New Brunswick.\n[3] Evan Forward was born in 1984. He was a student at McGill University in Montreal from September 2002 to December 2003. Otherwise, he has always lived in the United States.\n[4] In late 2001 or early 2002, Graham and Evan applied for a certificate of citizenship. They claimed citizenship through their mother, Patricia Brushett.\n[5] Patricia Brushett was born in the United States on May 10, 1955. She has always resided in the United States. Her parents are Ethel and Donald Brushett. They are Graham and Evan\u2019s grandparents.\n[6] When Patricia was born, Ethel was then and still is a Canadian citizen. Her father, Donald, once a Canadian citizen, became a naturalized American citizen on February 23, 1955, about three months before Patricia was born. At that point in time, he was no longer a Canadian citizen.\n[7] Jeff Forward is Graham\u2019s and Evan\u2019s father. He is an American citizen.\nA. The 1947 Citizenship Act [8] In 1955, when Patricia was born, the 1947 Canadian Citizenship Act (1947 Act) determined citizenship. Under s. 5(1)(b) of this Act, a person born outside Canada is a Canadian citizen if, at the time of his birth, his father is a Canadian citizen (or if born out of wedlock, his mother is a Canadian citizen). Canadian fathers could pass their citizenship to their children born abroad, but Canadian mothers (unless unwed) could not.\nB. The 1977 Citizenship Act [9] The 1947 Act was repealed and replaced by the 1977 Citizenship Act, R.S.C. c. C-29 (1977 Act). It created three categories of Canadian citizenship based on parental lineage for those born outside Canada:\npersons born outside Canada after February 14, 1977 are citizens at birth, if either of their parents, other than an adoptive parent, is Canadian at the time of their birth. (s. 3(1)(b)); persons born outside Canada before February 15, 1977 of a Canadian father or out of wedlock of a Canadian mother are citizens at birth if their birth is registered within a specified time. (s. 3(1)(e), incorporating s. 5(1)(b) of the 1947 Act); persons born outside Canada before February 15, 1977 of a Canadian mother must apply for citizenship and pass a security check, a criminal clearance check and swear an oath of citizenship. Citizenship is effective not from birth but from the date granted. (ss. 5(2)(b), 3(1)(c), 12 and 22).\nC. Patricia Brushett\u2019s Grant of Canadian Citizenship [10] At the time of her birth in 1955, Patricia was not eligible for Canadian citizenship which could only be passed through paternal lineage under the 1947 Act. However, she became eligible under s. 5(2)(b) of the 1977 Act. In February 2001, she applied for Canadian citizenship and she received her grant of citizenship effective December 2001.\nD. Graham Forward and Evan Forward - Application for Canadian Citizenship [11] Graham and Evan applied for Canadian citizenship in late December 2001 or early January 2002 under s. 3(1)(b) of the 1977 Act. They claimed citizenship through their mother, Patricia.\n[12] Their application was denied in a letter dated June 5, 2002, from Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). The reason for the denial was that at the time of their birth, neither of their parents were Canadian citizens. They did not qualify for citizenship under any of the parental lineage provisions of the 1977 Act.\nE. Graham Forward and Evan Forward - Complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Commission [13] Graham filed a complaint with the CHRC dated January 3, 2004. Evan\u2019s complaint is dated January 16, 2004. In their complaints, they allege that the CIC has discriminated against them contrary to s. 5(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA), on the grounds of family status and sex.\nF. Prima Facie Case of Discrimination [14] In complaints under the CHRA, it is well established that the complainants have the initial onus of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. The allegation in this case, under s. 5(b) of the CHRA is that the respondent differentiated adversely in relation to the complainants on a prohibited ground (family status and sex) in the provision of a service customarily available to the general public.\n[15] The determination of a prima facie case in respect of this allegation gives rise to the following questions:\ndoes the grant of a Canadian citizenship pursuant to the Citizenship Act constitute the provision of a service? were the complainants, in their attempt to obtain Canadian citizenship, subjected to adverse differentiation? if so, was this adverse differentiation based on a prohibited ground of discrimination?\nG. Citizenship as a Service \u2013 Singh, Druken, McKenna [16] Dealing first with the question of whether the granting of citizenship is a service, central to the complainants\u2019 position are three decisions, Re Singh, [1989] 1 F.C. 430 (F.C.A.); Canada (A.G.) v. Druken, [1989] 2 F.C. 24 (F.C.A.); and McKenna & CHRC v. Secretary of State, (1993) 22 C.H.R.R. 486 (CHRT); Canada (A.G.) v. McKenna, [1994] F.C.J. No. 1880 (FCTD); Canada (A.G.) v. McKenna, [1999] 1 F.C. 401 (CA).\n[17] Singh involved ten references by the CHRC to the Federal Court of Appeal. The references arose out of ten complaints made to the CHRC against the Department of External Affairs and the Canadian Employment and Immigration Commission. The complaints alleged discrimination under the CHRA, because the respondents denied visitors visas for family members of the complainants and denied the complainants the right to sponsor a close relative to immigrate to Canada.\n[18] The CHRC attempted to investigate these complaints but the government took the position that the complaints were beyond its jurisdiction and refused to allow the CHRC to pursue its investigation.\n[19] One of the grounds for the refusal was that the government departments responsible for these matters were not engaged in the provision of services customarily available to the general public.\n[20] For the Court of Appeal, the question to be answered on the references was whether the complaints cannot possibly relate to discriminatory practices in the provision of services customarily available to the general public.\n[21] As to this question, the Court concluded that:\nIt is indeed arguable that the qualifying words of s. 5, provision of services customarily available to the general public, can only serve a limiting role in the context of services rendered by private persons or bodies; that, by definition, services rendered by public servants at public expense are services to the public; and therefore fall within the ambit of s. 5. It is not however, necessary to make any final determination on this point at this stage and it is enough to state that it is not by any means clear that the services rendered, both in Canada and abroad, by the officers charged with the administration of the Immigration Act are not services customarily available to the general public (at p. 440).\n[22] In Druken, the complainants were employees of businesses owned by their spouses and were denied unemployment insurance benefits. Under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971, persons employed by their spouses or by companies controlled by their spouses were not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.\n[23] The complainants filed complaints with the CHRC alleging discrimination under s. 5 of the CHRA on the grounds of marital status and\/or family status. On referral to the Human Rights Tribunal, the Tribunal had to determine whether the provision of unemployment insurance benefits is a service customarily available to the general public. The Tribunal concluded that it was a service and went on to find that the impugned provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971 were discriminatory.\n[24] On application of the Attorney General to the Federal Court of Appeal to set aside the Tribunal decision, the question of services was not argued before the Court. The Court only commented that the Attorney General appeared to find persuasive the dictum in Singh.\n[25] McKenna involved three decisions, that of the Tribunal, the Federal Court Trial Division by way of judicial review and the Federal Court of Appeal on appeal from the Trial Division.\n[26] Shirley McKenna was the complainant before the Tribunal. She was a Canadian citizen who resided with her family in Ireland. She had two sons, both born in Canada and two adopted daughters both born outside Canada. Both of her adopted daughters were born before February 15, 1997.\n[27] She applied for Canadian passports for her two daughters but was advised by officials at the Canadian Embassy in Ireland that they could not claim citizenship under the 1977 Act through parental lineage.\n[28] Ms. McKenna filed a complaint with the CHRC alleging discrimination contrary to s. 5 of the CHRA on the ground of family status. Her complaint was referred to the Human Rights Tribunal for hearing.\n[29] On the question of whether the granting of citizenship is a service within s. 5 of the CHRA, the Tribunal reasoned that the 1977 Act is general in scope and when government officials apply the provisions of this Act, they provide a service to the public.\n[30] On judicial review of the Tribunal decision, the Federal Court set aside the Tribunal decision, one of the reasons being a failure of natural justice in the Tribunal proceedings. The Trial Court did not address the question of s. 5 of the CHRA.\n[31] Ms. McKenna appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal. This Court agreed with the Trial Court that there had been a denial of natural justice, and affirmed the decision of the Trial Division Court setting aside the Tribunal decision. But the Court of Appeal referred the matter back to the Tribunal to reconsider its decision in light of the Court\u2019s findings of a breach of natural justice. There is no evidence that the matter was reconsidered by the Tribunal.\n[32] The scope of s.5 of the CHRA as applied to citizenship was not argued before the Court of Appeal. However, the two majority judges did express their views on the scope of s. 5 of the CHRA. Robertson J.A. had this to say:\nWhile on focusing on this particular issue, I do not wish to leave the impression that I agree with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the granting of citizenship constitutes a service customarily available to the general public within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act and, therefore, that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to negotiate with the responsible Minister the manner in which the provisions of the Citizenship Act are to be applied in future. As this particular issue was not pursued before either the Motions Judge or this Court, I do not propose to deal with it other than to lay to rest the mistaken view that this Court\u2019s decision in Canada (Attorney General) v. Druken, [1989] 2 F.C. 24 (C.A.) somehow supports the proposition that the denial of citizenship constitutes the denial of a service.\nIn my opinion, Druken does not stand for the proposition that denial of unemployment insurance benefits constitutes denial of service within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act, but only that the Attorney General conceded as much.\n[33] Strayer J.A. shared the doubts of Robertson J.A. as to whether the grant of citizenship to a person born outside Canada can be considered a service customarily available to the general public.\n[34] Although it remains to be authoritatively decided, clearly the weight of judicial opinion is that the denial of citizenship in not a denial of a service under the CHRA.\nH. The Ambit of Services \u2013 S. 5 of the CHRA [35] The complainants\/Commission take the position that the rejection of Graham\u2019s and Evan\u2019s citizenship applications amounts to adverse differentiation in the provision of services.\n[36] In their argument, they specified that what is at issue in this case is not citizenship per se, but rather the right of someone claiming citizenship to have his or her application reviewed and administered in a non-discriminatory manner. The service at issue was the reviewing of applications for citizenship.\n[37] I do not accept this characterization of the complaint. The evidence and argument in the case was not directed at the conduct of ministerial officials, the exercise of discretion, or at the implementation of departmental policies and practices.\n[38] The sole source of the alleged discrimination in this case is the legislative language of the 1977 Act. In reviewing the application for citizenship, the officials did nothing more than apply categorical statutory criteria to undisputed facts. Any issue taken with the application review process is really an issue taken with the Act.\n[39] The respondent takes the position that citizenship cannot properly be considered a service. It relies on authorities holding that citizenship is a privilege \u2013 and not a right \u2013 that granting states can bestow or withhold on conditions they see fit.\n[40] The jurisprudence also indicates that citizenship confers a special, political status on a person that not only incorporates rights and duties but serves a highly symbolic function. The distinction between citizens and non-citizens is recognized in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. See Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143; Canada v. Chiarelli, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711.\n[41] In my opinion, the granting of citizenship does not constitute a service under the CHRA. Unlike other statutes such as the Unemployment Insurance Act, the Citizenship Act has a definitive and transformative impact on those individuals whom it recognizes as Canadians. As is indicated in the authorities, citizenship is a distinct status granted by the state, a status with constitutional dimensions. To characterize it as a mere service is to ignore its fundamental role in defining the relationship between individuals and the state.\n[42] Although not necessary for my finding above, I would add that Parliament might reasonably have intended the ambit of the word services in s. 5 to be informed by its placement alongside the words goods, facilities and accommodation (noscitur a sociis, the associated words rule). Viewed in this way, it is very difficult to conclude that the grant of citizenship is a service having a similar character to goods, facilities or accommodation.\n[43] For these reasons, I have concluded that the complainants\/Commission have not established a prima facie case of discrimination. I do not need to deal with the remaining questions relating to prima facie case.\nI. Discrimination by Association \u2013 Who are the Victims? \u2013 Retroactive\/Retrospective Application of the CHRA [44] The complainants\/Commission argued that the discrimination in this case originated with the victimization of the complainant\u2019s grandmother, Ethel. Ethel experienced discriminatory differential treatment under the 1947 Act, based on her sex. Moreover, the discrimination experienced by Ethel was visited upon her daughter Patricia (born in 1955), who was unable to claim an entitlement to Canadian citizenship.\n[45] According to the complainants\/Commission, the 1977 Act continued to treat Patricia unequally. They argue that the differential treatment affecting Patricia \u2013 based on her mother\u2019s gender \u2013 in turn victimized her sons, the complainants Graham and Evan.\n[46] Portrayed in this light, key aspects of the case for the complainants clearly implicate events and legal situations that occurred or existed prior to the coming into force of the CHRA in 1978.\n(i) The Benner decision [47] The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Benner v. Canada (Secretary of State) [1997] 1 S.C.R. 358 is fundamental to the resolution of the issues raised in the complaints.\n[48] Mr. Benner was born in 1962 in the United States, of a Canadian mother and an American father. He applied for Canadian citizenship on October 27, 1988 under the 1977 Act. As a person born outside Canada before February 15, 1977, of a Canadian mother, Mr. Benner was eligible for citizenship under s. 5(2)(b) of the 1977 Act. As such, he had to pass a security check and a criminal clearance check.\n[49] Mr. Benner\u2019s criminal clearance check revealed that he had been charged with several criminal offenses. The Registrar of Citizenship advised him that he was prohibited from acquiring citizenship and his application was denied on October 17, 1989.\n[50] He challenged this decision claiming that the 1977 Act imposed more onerous requirements on those claiming Canadian citizenship based on maternal lineage than on those claiming such citizenship based on paternal lineage. He argued that this differential treatment of persons born outside Canada to Canadian mothers before February 15, 1977, offended s. 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[51] The case proceeded to the Supreme Court of Canada. The threshold question for the Supreme Court was whether applying s. 15(1) of the Charter involved an illegitimate retroactive or retrospective application of the Charter to this fact situation.\n[52] In considering whether Mr. Benner\u2019s claim required a retrospective application of the Charter, the Court said that it is necessary first of all to characterize whether the facts in question establish a discrete event or constitute a continuing or ongoing status. In Mr. Benner\u2019s case, his status at the time of his birth was that of a person born outside of Canada before February 15, 1977, of a Canadian mother and an American father. This was a status that continued after the Charter came into effect and at the time the decision was made to deny his application for citizenship.\n[53] For the Supreme Court in applying s. 15 of the Charter, the critical time was not when Mr. Benner acquired the status in question, but when that status was held against him and disentitled him to a benefit. The Court found that moment occurred when the Registrar of Citizenship considered and rejected his application, namely, on October 17, 1989. That was the date when the alleged discrimination occurred.\n[54] The Court concluded that the Charter is not given retrospective effect if it is applied to persons who have acquired a particular status before the enactment of the Charter and that status continued after the Charter came into effect. Thus Mr. Benner\u2019s claim of discrimination was subject to Charter scrutiny.\n[55] The Court also dealt with the argument that Mr. Benner was attempting to raise the infringement of a third party\u2019s rights for his own benefit. That is the alleged discrimination under the 1977 Act was imposed upon his mother, not upon him.\n[56] The Court rejected this argument reasoning that Mr. Benner was the primary target of the sex based discrimination mandated by the 1977 Act. Section 5(2)(b), which Mr. Benner challenged, did not determine his mother\u2019s right to citizenship. His mother was only implicated because his rights were dependent on his maternal lineage.\nJ. Discrimination by Association - Who is the Victim of the Discrimination? [57] Benner is of assistance in the current case by chronologically situating the alleged discrimination to which the complainants were subjected. The relevant time at which to conduct the analysis is the moment at which Graham and Evan\u2019s status was held against them or disentitled them to a benefit. They have the status of being foreign born grandchildren of a Canadian grandmother since birth. But until their application for citizenship, they had not engaged the legislation governing their entitlement to citizenship.\n[58] Following Benner, the alleged discrimination did not take place until 2002, when their application for citizenship was denied on the basis of criteria which they allege violate s. 5 of the CHRA.\n[59] Having situated the alleged discrimination in time (well after the enactment of the CHRA), it remains to be decided whether the complainants were subjected to adverse differentiation on a prohibited ground, namely sex and family status.\n[60] Again, Benner is of assistance. Insofar as it establishes that the 1977 Act carries on the discrimination of the 1947 Act, it may itself be reviewed under s. 15 of the Charter. Similarly, in the current matter, it is no defence to the complainants\u2019 claim to say that any differential treatment has its true source in the now repealed 1947 Act. They were denied citizenship under the 1977 legislation. It is the operation of that statute that forms the basis of their complaint.\n[61] This brings us to a consideration of precisely which provisions of the 1977 Act the complainants seek to impugn. Both were born after 1977. As such, the provisions which affect them directly are paras. 3(1)(a) and 3(1)(b), which exclude them from citizenship since neither of their parents were citizens at that time of their birth, and they were not born in Canada. However, they do not argue that 3(1)(a) and 3(1)(b) discriminate on the grounds of sex and family status.\n[62] Although not specified, it appears (from their final argument) that they argue that 3(1)(e), which preserves the status of foreign born children of Canadian men (and unmarried women) under the 1947 Act, differentiates adversely against the foreign born children of Canadian married women. Moreover \u2013 and by extension \u2013 they argue that 3(1)(e) differentiates adversely against the foreign born children of foreign born children of Canadian married women.\n[63] This argument raises a problem of standing. The complainants do not stand in the shoes of Mr. Benner. Rather, they stand in the shoes of Mr. Benner\u2019s children \u2013 children born outside Canada. The complainants\/Commission say that this is a distinction without a difference. Benner applies with equal force to grandchildren. The respondent pleads the contrary.\n[64] It seems incontrovertible that Benner would be more analogous if Patricia had been the complainant in this case. Patricia, like Mr. Benner, would be able to withstand the argument that any discrimination imposed by 3(1)(e) is really imposed on the claimant\u2019s mother. For Patricia, like Mr. Benner, would be viewed as the primary target of the sex based discrimination mandated by the legislation. As the first generation victim of the exclusionary regime continued in s. 3(1)(e), Patricia would possess the necessary standing to raise the issue. She, like Mr. Benner, could be portrayed as the real target of the provision, and the one with the most direct interest in having them subjected to scrutiny under anti-discrimination law.\n[65] But Patricia is not asserted to be a victim in the current complaint; no order is sought for her benefit.\n[66] The complainants cannot be said to be the primary targets of s. 3(1)(e), nor the ones having the most direct interest in having them subjected to scrutiny under the CHRA. That claim belongs to Patricia. Unlike their mother, the complainants cannot be directly affected by s. 3(1)(e) because they were not born before 1977 and, as such, they were never entitled, immediately before 1977, to become a citizen under the 1947 Act. Since they were not directly affected by the impugned legislation, and since they do not claim a remedy for the benefit of an individual who is, the complainants do not possess the requisite standing to obtain relief under the CHRA.\n[67] The complainants\/Commission still insist that the brothers can be victims under the CHRA without running afoul of the statement in Benner that a party cannot rely upon the violation of a third party\u2019s Charter rights. First of all, the CHRA regime is more generous with standing; complainants can pursue remedies on behalf of other, victimized individuals (ss. 40(2), 50(1), 53(2)). More importantly, in Benner itself, the Court implicitly endorses a form of derivative standing, whereby the victim\u2019s treatment is dictated by the discriminatory differentiation visited upon his parents.\n[68] The Supreme Court pointed out that there was a connection between Mr. Benner\u2019s rights and the differentiation made by the legislation between men and women. The impugned provisions made Mr. Benner\u2019s citizenship rights dependent upon whether his Canadian parent was male or female. To deprive Mr. Benner of standing would allow a legislature to circumvent anti-discrimination rules by providing for indirect discrimination rather than mention its targets directly.\n[69] Further, the Court pointed out that the link between child and parent is of a particularly unique and intimate nature; a child has no control over who his or her parents are. Where access to benefits such as citizenship is restricted on the basis of something so intimately connected to and so completely beyond the control of an applicant as the gender of his or her Canadian parent, that applicant has standing to invoke s. 15 of the Charter.\n[70] On the other hand, these comments of the Court were obiter, prefaced as they were by the following statement:\nI hasten to add that I do not intend by these reasons to create a general doctrine of discrimination by association. I expressly leave this question to another day, since it is not necessary to address it in order to deal with the appeal. (Iaccobucci J. at para. 82)\n[71] The fact remains that the Court was not dealing with a situation where a grandchild was invoking the identity of his grandparent.\nK. Retroactive\/Respective Application of the CHRA [72] There is another key distinction; in Benner the Court was faced with the task of granting citizenship to the son of a woman who was Canadian at the time of his birth. In the current view, the Tribunal is asked to recognize Canadian citizenship for Graham and Evan whose mother was not a Canadian at the time of their birth.\n[73] Thus, even if there were no other remedial obstacles in this case \u2013 which there are \u2013 in order for the Tribunal to grant the complainants citizenship, it would be necessary to alter the citizenship of their mother Patricia so that she would be deemed to have been Canadian at the time of their birth. Only then would they be in a situation analogous to Mr. Benner\u2019s.\n[74] But as mentioned earlier, Patricia does not seek relief before this Tribunal and the complainants have not done so for her. In addition, viewing the complainants as having been born to a woman who was notionally Canadian at birth (i.e. had she been born to a Canadian father instead of a Canadian mother) involves applying the CHRA so as to change Patricia\u2019s status at the time of her birth (1955). This would require the retroactive application of legislation; that is to say, the CHRA which came into force in 1978 would be invoked to alter the legal status, at birth, of Patricia born in 1955.\n[75] It has been held (Latif v. Canada, [1980] 1 F.C. 687 (CA)) and the common law presumes that the legislature does not intend new legislation to be applied so as to change the past legal effect of a past situation. There is no indication that Parliament intended the CHRA to be applied otherwise. The presumption against retroactivity remains in effect.\n[76] Barring a change to Patricia\u2019s status, Graham and Evan are children born to two non-Canadians.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] The hearing in this complaint was convened at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, November 24, 2008 at Winnipeg, Manitoba. At the commencement of the hearing, the Tribunal Registry Officer read the case for hearing and called for appearances. Ms. Suzanne Dandenault, counsel for the Respondent Paterson GlobalFoods Incorporated was in attendance.\n[2] The Complainant, Mary C. Shepel, did not appear and was not in attendance at the opening of the hearing, nor did anyone appear on her behalf.\n[3] No one appeared at the hearing on behalf of the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[4] The Tribunal adjourned the hearing until 9:50 a.m. that same day. Upon resumption, the Registry Officer once again called for appearances. Counsel for the Respondent was again in attendance but neither Ms. Shepel nor anyone on her behalf was present.\n[5] On August 19, 2008, the Complainant requested the hearing of her complaint be held during the last week of October or mid to end of November 2008. In response to a further request from the Complainant for the hearing to be fixed, Ms. Shepel was advised by the Tribunal on September 11, 2008 that the hearing would proceed at Winnipeg from November 24 to 28, 2008.\n[6] In accordance with the Tribunal's instructions of September 26, 2008, the time for the Complainant to provide full disclosure pursuant to Tribunal Rule 6 was extended to October 3, 2008. The Complainant later advised the Tribunal on October 9, 2008 that her disclosure would be filed on October 14, 2008.\n[7] The Complainant failed to meet her disclosure deadline as per Rule 6(1) of the Tribunal's Rules and Procedures. Nor has the Complainant requested a further extension or a conference call with the Tribunal to discuss the outstanding issue of disclosure.\n[8] A Notice confirming the November hearing dates was sent to Ms. Shepel on October 10, 2008. On November 6, 2008, Ms. Shepel wrote to the Tribunal that she no longer had the resources or time to go forward with the preparation needed for the Tribunal process.\n[9] On November 13, 2008, the Tribunal notified Ms. Shepel again of the location, dates and time for the hearing of her complaint. Ms. Shepel responded on November 20, 2008 that she would not be participating in the hearing at this time. She did not request that the hearing be rescheduled.\n[10] No evidence was called or otherwise provided in support of Mary Shepel's complaint at the hearing on November 24, 2008. Accordingly, I find that the complaint against Paterson GlobalFoods Incorporated has not been substantiated and is hereby dismissed under section 53(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nSigned by\nJ.

Hadjis\n[1] The Commission has moved to obtain an order from the Tribunal that the Respondent Jason Ouwendyk and his agent refrain from using, in written documents filed in this case, language meant to demean the Complainant, the Tribunal, the Commission or any officer of the Court. The Commission also objects to Mr. Ouwendyk's agent in this case, Alexan Kulbashian, using the letters HR instead of the words Human Rights when referring to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in his written pleadings. The Commission seeks an order that the Respondent cease this practice. The Commission also requests that the Respondent's Statement of Particulars and Charter Challenge Witness List, which contain the above references, be rejected and declared expunged from the Tribunal's Record.\n[2] Section 50(1) of the Act states that the Tribunal must provide parties with the full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel (avocat or lawyer in the French rendering), to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. It has been the Tribunal's practice, nevertheless, to permit non-lawyer agents of parties to appear as well (see Brown v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 30 at paras. 86-7; Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 CHRT 27 at para. 16). However, the Tribunal may, at its discretion, limit participation to those agents whom the Tribunal believes will facilitate, rather than hinder, its adjudicative process (Filgueira at para. 15). Accordingly, where an agent of a party behaves in a manner that is offensive or disrespectful towards the other parties or to the Tribunal itself, in my view, the Tribunal is entitled to exercise its discretion to deny the agent permission to represent the party in the proceeding.\n[3] In the present case, I note that Mr. Kulbashian has called the Complainant a liar. He appears to refer to the Commission and\/or the Tribunal as a thug dressed like a lawyer and to a Tribunal member as a fanatic. Although a party is entitled to question another party's credibility and challenge the legality of the Tribunal's process, this sort of demeaning language is inappropriate and unacceptable in any adjudicative proceeding. The Tribunal hereby advises and directs Mr. Kulbashian not to repeat remarks of this nature in his future dealings with this case, failing which he will no longer be permitted to appear in this proceeding as Mr. Ouwendyk's representative.\n[4] As for the Commission's request regarding Mr. Ouwendyk's use of the letters HR, the Tribunal does not find that this matter warrants its intervention. The impugned documents will not be expunged.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[1] On May 9th and 10th, 2007, two Commission employees, Hannya Rizk and Dean Steacy, testified in this case. I ruled at that time that persons other than the parties and their representatives be excluded from the hearing room while both witnesses testified, pursuant to s. 52 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Their evidence was transcribed by court reporters. The transcripts were not subject to the exclusionary order and were provided to the parties.\n[2] Both witnesses are now scheduled to continue their evidence on March 25, 2008. Mr. Lemire and the Canadian Association for the Freedom of Expression have requested that the Tribunal revisit its ruling. Rogers Publishing Limited, a division of Rogers Media Inc., has made a similar request on behalf of Maclean's Magazine, specifically asking that representatives of the magazine be permitted to attend, observe and report on the evidence to be tendered at this hearing. The Attorney General of Canada states, for its part, that this hearing should be conducted in accordance with the usual procedure of holding open hearings in Tribunal cases, unless the Tribunal is satisfied that closing the hearing room is necessary to ensure the safety of the participants.\n[3] The Commission proposes in its submissions that the order be maintained but that other measures be put in place to better accommodate members of the public who wish to attend the hearing, including a video link to another room where the public could observe the hearing without being able to observe the witnesses.\n[4] I have come to the conclusion that my previous ruling should be rescinded.\n[5] In addressing this matter, it is important to understand the context in which my initial ruling was made. At Mr. Lemire's request, the Tribunal had issued subpoenas summoning Ms. Rizk and Mr. Steacy to attend the hearing and give evidence. In the afternoon of May 8, 2007, the Commission sent a letter by fax to the Tribunal stating that pursuant to s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act, it formally objected to the disclosure of the visual appearance of its employees during the Tribunal proceedings and certified that this information was not to be disclosed on the basis of the public interest in ensuring the security of these individuals during and after the testimony. The Commission added that as a result of its s. 37 objection, it had instructed Ms. Rizk and Mr. Steacy not to attend the Tribunal hearing but to remain available until the matter of this objection was resolved.\n[6] When Commission counsel appeared at the hearing on May 9, 2007, his position was unambiguous: ...we have invoked section 37. If there are no measures put in place, we are invoking it. If the measures that I am asking for today are put in place, then we will not invoke, we will withdraw our objection on the basis of section 37, for the purpose of their attending and the disclosure of their visual appearance.\n[7] I issued my ruling regarding the exclusion of non-parties from the hearing room orally that morning. The ruling was premised in large part by this looming likelihood that the Commission would invoke s. 37 unless the measures that it was demanding were put in place. The hearing proceeded but the Commission nonetheless invoked s. 37 numerous times to object to questions posed by Mr. Lemire's counsel to Ms. Rizk and Mr. Steacy. The Commission alleged public security concerns in making its objections.\n[8] Mr. Lemire later challenged those objections before the Federal Court, which has the exclusive authority to rule when such matters arise before the Tribunal. Interestingly, however, it appears that a few weeks before the January 15, 2008, Federal Court hearing into these objections, the Commission disclosed to Mr. Lemire the information that was the subject of the s. 37 application. The Court therefore determined that since the information had been disclosed, it could no longer properly consider the s. 37 application, which the disclosure had effectively rendered moot. In effect, the Commission disclosed the very information that it had previously claimed could not be disclosed pursuant to s. 37. I note that the Commission also withdrew, before the Federal Court, its s. 37 objection to the issuance of a subpoena of Bell Canada (see the Federal Court's ruling, January 15, 2008, Docket no. T-860-07).\n[9] The outcome of the s. 37 matter gives me pause to question the soundness of the Commission's invocation of public security concerns with respect to the testimony of these witnesses.\n[10] More significantly, however, having now had the benefit of considering the question in circumstances different than those in which I was placed on the morning of May 9, 2007, I am not persuaded that the witnesses are exposed to a real and substantial risk that undue hardship will be caused to the persons involved, as contemplated in s. 52(1)(c) of the Act, nor that there is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered, as contemplated by s. 52(1)(d) of the Act. The excerpts from the Internet cited by the Commission in its submissions do not, in my view, satisfy these criteria. They are indicative of no greater risk than that which has been suggested in the past by comments addressed to other participants in this and other s. 13 cases, including counsel, Tribunal members and staff, and the parties themselves.\n[11] I am therefore rescinding the order. The hearing will be conducted in public, as mandated by s. 52(1) of the Act. I would note for the record that the Commission is mistaken in its submissions that the order came about pursuant to my ruling of May 7, 2007, which had merely excluded cameras from the Tribunal premises. That ruling preceded the exclusion order. No request has been made for me to revisit the May 7th ruling and as a result, cameras will remain excluded from the Tribunal's premises.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n[1] These are the reasons which I delivered orally during this hearing.\n[2] This hearing was convened on Monday, March 3, 2008 in Ottawa with a videoconference link to the Federal Court in Edmonton to allow the Respondents, Ronald and Heather Fleming, to be present without having to travel to Ottawa. At the commencement of the hearing, the Tribunal Registry Officer read the Case for Hearing and called for appearances. Ms. Ikram Warsame was present and appeared on behalf of the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[3] The Complainant, beachesboy@aol.com, was not present at the hearing, nor was anyone present who appeared on his behalf.\n[4] The Respondents, Mr. and Mrs. Ronald and Heather Fleming, were not present at the hearing, nor was anyone present who appeared on their behalf.\n[5] The Tribunal requested that the Manager of the Federal Court building ascertain whether there was anyone in the lobby of the Court by the name of Fleming. The Manager reported that there was no one in the lobby.\n[6] The Notice of Hearing in this matter, dated February 1, 2008, was filed by the Registry Officer. The Registry Officer stated that the Notice of Hearing had been sent to the Respondents by courier and to the Complainant by email. The Tribunal notes that in previous correspondence, the Respondents indicated that they would not accept personal service of documents on their premises. Therefore, all correspondence was sent to them by regular mail or courier.\n[7] The Registry Officer also filed copies of correspondence from the Complainant indicating that he would be unable to attend the hearing for three months due to work commitments, and that he was also unable to participate in a teleconference due to work commitments. The Registry Officer filed a copy of the electronic mail that was sent to the Complainant on February 25, 2008, from the Tribunal indicating that the Tribunal is required to conduct inquiries into complaints of discrimination on an expeditious manner. Given that the Complainant was not available to discuss the issue of an adjournment prior to the commencement of the hearing, the Tribunal ordered that this matter be dealt with at the outset of the hearing on Monday, March 3, 2008.\n[8] The Tribunal also indicated to the Complainant in the electronic correspondence of February 25, 2008 that it was open to the Complainant to point to the Tribunal's Notice of Hearing to substantiate to his employer that he had a valid reason for his absence. It was also open to the Commission to request a subpoena requiring his testimony.\n[9] The Complainant participated in establishing the dates for the hearing and had been aware of them for some time. In addition, the Complainant was part of the decision to set the hearing venue in Ottawa with a videoconference link to Edmonton.\n[10] Ms. Warsame, for the Commission, indicated at the hearing on Monday morning that the Complainant had not responded to inquiries regarding travel arrangements for the hearing on March 3, 2008. Furthermore, the Complainant had not responded to the Commission's request to provide assistance in the preparation of the Book of Documents for the hearing. Ms. Warsame indicated that the Complainant was her only witness and therefore, if he did not attend the hearing she was not in a position to call evidence on this matter.\n[11] The Tribunal ordered that the hearing be adjourned for two days to provide the Complainant and the Respondents time to communicate to the Tribunal as to whether they intended to proceed with the complaint, or if they were requesting a further adjournment or a dismissal of the complaint.\n[12] The Tribunal than issued a letter on the same day, March 3, 2008 confirming that the matter had been adjourned until March 5, 2008. In the same letter, the Tribunal noted that the matter had been pending before the Tribunal since October of 2006. The Tribunal has an obligation to proceed expeditiously with inquiries. Therefore, the request for an adjournment of three months was unreasonable. The Tribunal directed that the Complainants and\/or the Respondents attend the hearing on March 5, 2008. The Tribunal indicated that if these directions were not complied with, it may dismiss the complaint (In fact, the letter sent by the Tribunal Registry invited the Complainant to attend or provide submissions).\n[13] The Tribunal has reconvened today, Wednesday, March 5, 2008. Ms. Warsame is present on behalf of the Commission. Neither the Complainant nor the Respondents are present today, nor is anyone present who appeared on their behalf. The Registry Officer was informed by personnel at the Federal Court Building in Edmonton that no one had presented themselves for the hearing into this matter today.\n[14] The Complainant and the Respondent have not communicated with the Tribunal regarding their non-attendance, nor have they provided a suggestion for a more reasonable time frame for an adjournment.\n[15] Ms. Warsame provided an outline of the attempts that the Commission has made to contact the Complainant to ascertain his intentions with respect to the complaint. The Complainant has not responded to these requests for information. On that basis, the Commission decided not to issue a subpoena for his attendance and testimony at the hearing today. Ms. Warsame indicated that the Complainant is her only witness. Given that he is not present today, she is unable to call any evidence in support of the complaint.\n[16] Accordingly, I find that the complaint has not been substantiated and the complaint is hereby dismissed under s. 53(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion presented by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT). It involves a complaint by Sally Wade that her employer, DFAIT discriminated against her on the basis of her marital status and family status by denying her a three bedroom staff quarter pursuant to the Foreign Service Directive. The Directive is part of the collective agreement between Treasury Board and Ms. Wade's bargaining agent, the Public Service of Canada (PSAC).\n[2] The Respondent, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), requests an Order:\nadding Treasury Board as a party to the complaint (as represented by the Attorney General of Canada); adding the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) as a respondent to the complaint; and, amending the style of cause by substituting the Attorney General of Canada for the the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.\n[3] The Complainant does not object to the requests, but states that if PSAC is added as a respondent, the complaint should be amended to include sections 9 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 10 is already part of the original complaint.\n[4] Section 9 of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice for an employee organization to limit, segregate, classify or otherwise act in a way that would limit or deprive individuals of employment opportunities.\n[5] PSAC does not oppose the motion to add it as a Respondent, nor does it oppose the addition of Treasury Board and the amendment of the style of cause. Finally, PSAC does not object to the addition of s. 9 to the complaint.\n[6] The Respondent DFAIT does not object to the amendment of the complaint to include s. 9.\n[7] The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not participate in the motion.\nThe Addition of Treasury Board and the PSAC as Respondents\n[8] Section 48.9(2)(b) of the CHRA provides the Tribunal with the authority to add parties to its proceedings. A new party should be added at the inquiry stage only if the addition of the party is necessary to properly dispose of the complaint and if there is a tenable basis for the allegations against the new party. The Tribunal must also consider the prejudice that may result to the parties by adding them at this stage in the process (Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone v. TELUS Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., [2003] C.H.R.D. No. 29; Brown v. National Capital Commission, [2003] C.H.R.D. No. 36; Smith v. Canadian National Railway 2005 CHRT 23).\n[9] Treasury Board and PSAC negotiate the terms of the Foreign Service Directives; it is Treasury Board and PSAC that have knowledge about the Directives. DFAIT has no power to affect the wording of the Directives. If the complaint is substantiated and a remedy ordered, Treasury Board and PSAC are the organizations that will implement the remedy with respect to the Directives. Therefore, these two organizations are important to the resolution of the complaint. Furthermore, there is a tenable basis for the allegations that PSAC and Treasury Board may share liability in the event that the complaint is substantiated.\n[10] The proposed Respondents have not objected to their addition as parties and have not argued that any prejudice will arise from adding them at this stage of the process.\n[11] Therefore, I order that Treasury Board and PSAC will be added as parties to the complaint.\nThe amendment of the Complaint to include s. 9 of the CHRA\n[12] The Complainant has requested that the complaint be amended to include s. 9 of the CHRA which prohibits an employee organization from limiting an employee's employment opportunities on the basis of prohibited grounds of discrimination.\n[13] The Tribunal has the authority to amend complaints where the amendment respects the scope of the original complaint, and where the parties have been given sufficient notice of the amendment (Canadian Museum of Civilization v. PSAC 2006 FC 704 at paras. 50-52).\n[14] In the present case, PSAC does not object to the proposed amendment to the complaint. It states that citing the proper sections of the Act is critical to ensuring that the issues are fully aired before the Tribunal.\n[15] I agree with the PSAC on this point. I order the complaint to be amended to include s. 9 of the CHRA.\nThe Amendment of the Style of Cause\n[16] Counsel for the Respondent states that the Attorney General of Canada, as the representative of the federal Crown should be substituted for DFAIT as the Respondent.\n[17] The Respondent argues that DFAIT does not have a distinct and legal personality. It is simply a department of the Government of Canada. Therefore, DFAIT does not have the capacity to be party to a complaint. The proper party to the complaint is the Attorney General of Canada as the representative of the federal Crown (Munro v. Canada (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 1 (Gen. Div.) at pp. 10-13).\n[18] Although s. 7.2 of the Financial Administration Act vests Treasury Board with the capacity to be named as a respondent, both DFAIT and Treasury Board fall under the umbrella of the Attorney General of Canada. Therefore, the Respondent argued that it was unnecessary to refer to either DFAIT or Treasury Board in the style of cause. However, the Respondent stated that it would not object to amending the style of cause to read the Attorney General of Canada (representing the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and Treasury Board).\n[19] The Complainant and PSAC voiced no objection to the amendment of the style of cause provided it read as suggested above.\n[20] A review of the jurisprudence cited by the Respondent, as well as the relevant legislation, discloses that the Respondent is correct, and that the Complainant's case should properly be brought against the Attorney General of Canada. The Tribunal has in fact issued comparable orders in other cases involving the federal Crown (Plante v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2003 CHRT 28; Wiseman v. Attorney General of Canada, 2007 CHRT 13; Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police [2004] C.H.R.D. No. 32).\n[21] Therefore, I order that the style of cause be amended to read: Sally Wade v. Attorney General of Canada (representing the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and Treasury Board) and Public Service Alliance of Canada.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] Dans un jugement dat\u00e9 du 30 janvier 2008, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 ma d\u00e9cision sur les d\u00e9pens en l'esp\u00e8ce et l'a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour nouvel examen (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mowat, 2008 CF 118). Dans son jugement, la Cour a convenu que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour les frais juridiques engag\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce. En outre, la Cour n'a pas comment\u00e9 le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin par le Tribunal. Elle a toutefois d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le Tribunal avait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir de motiver ad\u00e9quatement sa d\u00e9cision d'adjuger des frais juridiques, et a renvoy\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision au m\u00eame d\u00e9cideur du Tribunal, sans que le d\u00e9cideur ait \u00e0 formuler d'autres observations ou \u00e0 tenir une autre audience.\n[2] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada a interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale quant \u00e0 la question du pouvoir d'octroyer des d\u00e9pens. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire diff\u00e9rer la communication de ses motifs suppl\u00e9mentaires et il n'a pas non plus, \u00e0 la connaissance du Tribunal, demand\u00e9 ou obtenu un sursis interdisant au Tribunal de rendre des motifs suppl\u00e9mentaires en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[3] Mme Mowat \u00e9tait caporal-chef au moment o\u00f9 elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte dat\u00e9e du 15 juin 1998 \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes avaient agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en raison de son sexe :\nen la d\u00e9favorisant en cours d'emploi et en refusant de continuer de l'employer, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi); en ne lui fournissant pas un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement, en contravention de l'article 14 de la Loi. Une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement sexuel figurait \u00e9galement dans la plainte.\n[4] Mme Mowat a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que des repr\u00e9sailles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es contre elle, en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la Loi. Cette all\u00e9gation a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par voie de requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire et a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le Tribunal. Dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal, Mme Mowat a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 de 430 685 $ (ce montant ne comprenait pas les montants ind\u00e9termin\u00e9s pour les cotisations au RPC, pour la pension des FC, pour souffrances morales et dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats exemplaires pour mauvaise foi excluant les frais juridiques).\n[5] L'audition de sa plainte a dur\u00e9 environ six (6) semaines, et la transcription des t\u00e9moignages rendus au cours de l'instance comprenait plus de 4 000 pages. En outre, plus de 400 pi\u00e8ces ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve. Le Tribunal a conclu que la plainte de harc\u00e8lement sexuel d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Mowat \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e et lui a accord\u00e9 4 000 $ plus des int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 toutes les autres all\u00e9gations de discrimination, y compris ses all\u00e9gations de lib\u00e9ration discriminatoire, de traitement d\u00e9favorable en cours d'emploi et de harc\u00e8lement non sexuel.\n[6] Le 20 mars 2006, les deux parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations orales et \u00e9crites au Tribunal sur la question des frais juridiques. Mme Mowat a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne s'attendait pas \u00e0 se voir adjuger 100 p. 100 ou m\u00eame 75 p. 100 des frais juridiques de 196 313 $ qu'elle avait r\u00e9clam\u00e9s au d\u00e9part. L'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu que la plaignante ne devrait recevoir aucun montant au titre des frais juridiques ou ne devrait recevoir qu'un montant tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9 parce que la majorit\u00e9 de ses all\u00e9gations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es. De plus, l'audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 inutilement longue et complexe parce que la plaignante n'a pas clairement formul\u00e9 ses plaintes.\n[7] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 signal\u00e9, la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal selon laquelle il avait comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des frais juridiques en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la Cour dans son jugement. Les motifs suppl\u00e9mentaires pour lesquels j'ai octroy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Mowat la somme de 47 000 $ au titre des frais juridiques en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) sont les suivants.\n[8] Dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 qu'il serait utile que la plaignante pr\u00e9sente ses frais juridiques en une forme semblable au tarif B des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. C'est ce que la plaignante a fait quand elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son m\u00e9moire de frais en date du 30 mai 2006. Par lettre dat\u00e9e du 30 juin 2006, l'intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu en proposant ses propres montants compte tenu du m\u00e9moire de la plaignante.\n[9] La plaignante a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des honoraires de pr\u00e9paration et de participation \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences de m\u00e9diation et de r\u00e8glement qui ont eu lieu s\u00e9par\u00e9ment en mars 2002 et en septembre 2003. La pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal en janvier 2003. Je reconnais que le Tribunal devrait accorder \u00e0 la plaignante une partie des honoraires qu'elle a pay\u00e9s pour avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence de septembre 2003, mais pas pour l'autre conf\u00e9rence. Je lui ai donc accord\u00e9 15 unit\u00e9s pour 5 heures de pr\u00e9sence et 4 unit\u00e9s de pr\u00e9paration. Mme Mowat a droit \u00e0 ces frais raisonnables seulement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la conf\u00e9rence de r\u00e8glement de 2003.\n[10] La plaignante a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 5 unit\u00e9s pour la communication de documents. La pleine communication de la preuve est obligatoire dans les instances du Tribunal. J'ai donc accord\u00e9 les 5 unit\u00e9s r\u00e9clam\u00e9es \u00e0 cet article.\n[11] La plaignante a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 un total de 24 unit\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate concernant la participation de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Je rel\u00e8ve que l'avocat de la plaignante n'a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 aucun document, pris aucune position claire et fait seulement de tr\u00e8s br\u00e8ves observations sur cette requ\u00eate. Il serait donc d\u00e9raisonnable, \u00e0 mon avis, de s'attendre que l'intim\u00e9e supporte cette d\u00e9pense. J'ai rejet\u00e9 cette r\u00e9clamation.\n[12] La plaignante a demand\u00e9 le nombre maximal d'unit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 la colonne III du tarif B de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des honoraires d'avocat pour la pr\u00e9paration de l'audience en vertu de l'article 13a) et ensuite pour 26 jours d'audience en vertu de l'article 13b). Elle a aussi demand\u00e9 le maximum correspondant \u00e0 22 jours complets et \u00e0 5 demi-journ\u00e9es de participation \u00e0 l'audience en application des articles 14a) et 14b) du tarif.\n[13] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 toutes les all\u00e9gations de discrimination de la plaignante, de m\u00eame que son all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la Loi. Mme Mowat n'a eu gain de cause qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Le Tribunal a aussi soulign\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte que, outre l'all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement sexuel faite par Mme Mowat, l'instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par le fait que Mme Mowat n'a tout simplement pas expos\u00e9 avec pr\u00e9cision la nature de sa th\u00e8se.\n[14] Aussi convaincant cet argument puisse-t-il \u00eatre pour justifier la r\u00e9duction des honoraires que l'intim\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre tenue de payer, il demeure tout aussi important que la Commission ait exerc\u00e9 manifestement le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de renvoyer la plainte de Mme Mowat au Tribunal pour enqu\u00eate. La plaignante, sans le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la r\u00e9trospective d'aujourd'hui, a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte de faire valoir tous les aspects de sa plainte. De telles affaires de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e sont tr\u00e8s souvent complexes au chapitre des faits. En outre, tout bien consid\u00e9r\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que l'intim\u00e9e avait fait preuve de discrimination envers Mme Mowat.\n[15] Apr\u00e8s avoir tenu compte de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, ainsi que de l'issue de la plainte et de la fa\u00e7on dont la th\u00e8se de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, et avoir examin\u00e9 le nombre de jours d'audience, j'ai accord\u00e9 5 unit\u00e9s au titre de l'article 13a) pour la pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 l'audience et 50 unit\u00e9s au titre de l'article 13b) relativement aux 25 jours suivant le premier jour d'audience. Quant aux honoraires d'avocat r\u00e9clam\u00e9s pour la participation \u00e0 l'audience, j'ai accord\u00e9 275 unit\u00e9s au total pour 137,5 heures d'audience.\n[16] Puisqu'aucune raison sp\u00e9ciale ne justifiait de mani\u00e8re \u00e9vidente la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'avoir recours \u00e0 un deuxi\u00e8me avocat, j'ai rejet\u00e9 les d\u00e9pens demand\u00e9s par la plaignante au titre de l'article 14b) du tarif. Vu les consid\u00e9rations ci-dessus et la complexit\u00e9 qu'implique l'\u00e9tablissement de la correspondance entre l'instance du Tribunal et les articles du tarif de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, j'ai accord\u00e9 5 unit\u00e9s pour les honoraires d'avocat visant la r\u00e9daction et la pr\u00e9sentation du m\u00e9moire de frais de la plaignante.\n[17] L'\u00e9tat de compte d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par la plaignante contenait un taux horaire de 250 $ pour ses honoraires d'avocat. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu que la valeur unitaire de 120 $ pr\u00e9vue au tarif B des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales en date du 1er avril 2005 serait plus ad\u00e9quate. Dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, et particuli\u00e8rement compte tenu du succ\u00e8s limit\u00e9 de la plainte de Mme Mowat, je suis enclin \u00e0 tomber d'accord avec l'intim\u00e9e sur ce point. J'ai accord\u00e9 un total de 359 unit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des honoraires d'avocat. Si l'on applique une valeur unitaire de 120 $, on obtient un total de 43 080 $ pour les honoraires d'avocat.\n[18] La plaignante a demand\u00e9 que 6 499,83 $ en honoraires d'avocat soient vers\u00e9s au cabinet juridique Gahrns & Lalibert\u00e9. On ne sait pas quelle partie de ses services ou dans quelle mesure ceux-ci se rapportent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte, mais il ressort manifestement de la facture produite qu'une certaine consultation avait trait \u00e0 la plainte renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. L'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu responsable d'avoir fait preuve de discrimination envers Mme Mowat. Il est donc raisonnable, \u00e0 mon avis, d'accorder les 800 $ pay\u00e9s par la plaignante elle-m\u00eame pour ce service, comme en a convenu l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e dans ses observations orales.\n[19] L'approche adopt\u00e9e par l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation par la plaignante des frais d'h\u00f4tel semble tout \u00e0 fait raisonnable dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce. La somme de 2 754 $ a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e au titre de ces frais. La demande de 265 $ pour les frais de stationnement et de taxi est moins toutefois moins claire; 115 $ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s pour ces frais. Certains documents concernant le stationnement et les taxis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en tant que preuve d'une d\u00e9pense, mais une comptabilisation claire et convaincante n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Les frais de messagerie demand\u00e9s ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duits \u00e0 26,10 $ pour des raisons semblables.\n[20] La demande de 81 $ touchant le t\u00e9moin Campbell a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie. La d\u00e9position du t\u00e9moin se rapportait \u00e0 la plainte, et le t\u00e9moin a clairement pay\u00e9 cette somme lui-m\u00eame.\n[21] Les montants r\u00e9clam\u00e9s de 10,83 $, 2 166,75 $, 187,25 $, 26,75 $ et 404,46 $ pour les photocopies, les t\u00e9l\u00e9copies, les relieurs \u00e0 feuilles mobiles, les onglets, les imprim\u00e9s ainsi que les appels interurbains et la distance parcourue ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s pour absence de comptabilisation claire et d'\u00e9tablissement pr\u00e9cis du rapport entre ces montants et l'instance du Tribunal. Il n'est pas raisonnable de s'attendre \u00e0 ce que l'intim\u00e9e paie des frais de cette nature, qui peuvent par ailleurs \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s indirects, au terme d'une taxation assimilable \u00e0 celle faite sur la base partie-partie, \u00e0 moins que l'on ait d\u00e9montr\u00e9, \u00e0 l'aide d'une comptabilisation claire, que ces frais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9s directement pour la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[22] La plaignante r\u00e9clame aussi des frais de 856 $ pour l'\u00e9valuation de la pension. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9bout\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 la question de la pension et qu'elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre en mesure d'obtenir le remboursement de cette d\u00e9pense aupr\u00e8s de l'intim\u00e9e au titre des d\u00e9bours. Je suis d'accord, et j'ai donc refus\u00e9 ce montant.\n[23] La plaignante a aussi demand\u00e9 3 045,67 $ pour la transcription. La remarque du Tribunal, selon laquelle l'instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par le fait que Mme Mowat n'a tout simplement pas expos\u00e9 avec pr\u00e9cision la nature de sa th\u00e8se, est, encore une fois, importante quant \u00e0 l'examen de cet article. \u00c0 part des besoins d'un appel, la transcription est un luxe. En l'absence de circonstances justifiant l'utilit\u00e9 exceptionnelle de la transcription pour l'avocat \u00e0 l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte (p. ex. afin d'aider \u00e0 raccourcir la dur\u00e9e de l'audience), l'intim\u00e9e ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 payer les frais de la transcription. Ces d\u00e9bours ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9s.\n[24] La plaignante a \u00e9galement produit des factures totalisant 343,90 $ pour la recherche dans Quicklaw. Il est juste de dire que les droits de la personne sont quelque peu moins tentaculaires en pratique, \u00e0 l'instar de d'autres domaines du droit. Il est donc extr\u00eamement important, dans l'optique de pr\u00e9senter un argument convaincant pour \u00e9tayer une all\u00e9gation de discrimination en violation de la Loi, d'aider le Tribunal dans ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations en pr\u00e9sentant une jurisprudence exacte et \u00e0 jour. On pourrait soutenir par ailleurs que le co\u00fbt de la recherche dans Quicklaw devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme faisant partie des frais indirects pay\u00e9s par un cabinet juridique plut\u00f4t que comme une menue d\u00e9pense. J'ai r\u00e9duit ces frais \u00e0 143,90 $. Cette recherche est tout aussi utile au Tribunal qu'elle l'est \u00e0 la cause d'une partie, mais le succ\u00e8s fort limit\u00e9 de la plainte milite contre l'octroi int\u00e9gral de ces frais.\n[25] Par cons\u00e9quent, et en sus des motifs donn\u00e9s auparavant par le Tribunal, Mme Mowat a droit \u00e0 47 000 $ au total pour ses frais juridiques en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi. La demande de Mme Mowat visant les int\u00e9r\u00eats courant \u00e0 partir de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est rejet\u00e9e pour les motifs d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9s. Des int\u00e9r\u00eats sont cependant payables sur les d\u00e9pens adjug\u00e9s, et courent de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision jusqu'\u00e0 la date du paiement des d\u00e9pens. Encore une fois, ces int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 9(12)a) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\nSign\u00e9 par J.

Indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin\n[1] Le Centre de recherche-action sur les relations raciales (CRARR) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte, dans laquelle il est soutenu qu'il y a violation de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre [traduction] la ou les personnes directement responsables du site Web www.members\/odinrage.com\/bcwhitepride.com\/immigration.htm, \u00e9galement connu sous le nom BCWhitePride.com . Le CRARR pr\u00e9tend que ce site Web incite, [traduction] entre autres , \u00e0 la discrimination, \u00e0 la haine et \u00e0 d'autres violations du droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 des personnes en raison de leur race, de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, de leur religion, de leur d\u00e9ficience et de leur statut d'immigrant.\nI. QUESTIONS PR\u00c9LIMINAIRES [2] Le 24 janvier 2006, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal. Avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour que soit modifi\u00e9 l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause afin d'y ajouter en tant que parties d\u00e9fenderesses John Beck, www.bcwhitepride.org, ainsi que deux groupes connus sous les noms de BC White Pride et White Renegade .\n[3] Le 18 mai 2007, le membre du Tribunal Pierre Deschamps a rendu une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la Commission, dans laquelle d\u00e9cision il autorisait l'adjonction de John Beck en tant que partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure (Centre de recherche-action sur les relations raciales c. www.bcwhitepride.com, 2007 TCDP 20). Cependant, le membre Deschamps n'a pas autoris\u00e9 que soit ajout\u00e9 le groupe White Renegade en tant que partie. Pour ce qui est du groupe BC White Pride et de www.bcwhitepride.org, il a ordonn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision leur soit signifi\u00e9e pour qu'ils puissent, en temps utile, pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la requ\u00eate de la Commission visant \u00e0 les faire ajouter en tant que parties. Au d\u00e9but de l'audience sur la plainte, j'ai appris que la Commission n'avait pas signifi\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 ces deux parties potentielles. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ai jug\u00e9 que la plainte ne serait pas modifi\u00e9e pour les inclure.\n[4] En cons\u00e9quence, les seuls intim\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience sur le fond de la plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 www.bcwhitepride.com et John Beck. La Commission \u00e9tait la seule partie repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat \u00e0 l'audience. Le directeur ex\u00e9cutif du CRARR, Fo Niemi, a comparu au nom du plaignant. M. Beck \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l'audience et \u00e9tait aid\u00e9 de Paul Fromm, qui n'est pas avocat. M. Fromm agissait \u00e0 titre d'agent de M. Beck. Il a fait une d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9liminaire, interrog\u00e9 les t\u00e9moins et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des conclusions finales au nom de M. Beck. Personne n'a comparu au nom de www.bcwhitepride.com.\nII. D\u00c9CISION [5] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessous, j'ai conclu que la plainte visant M. Beck \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e. Par contre, pour ce qui est de www.bcwhitepride.com, j'ai conclu qu'il s'agit simplement de l'adresse Internet d'un site Web et non d'une personne ou d'un groupe de personnes au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte visant www.bcwhitepride.com n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tay\u00e9e.\nIII. L'ARTICLE 13 DE LA LOI [6] Pour qu'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) soit fond\u00e9e, il faut prouver que:\nune personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord\na utilis\u00e9 ou fait utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement\npour aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3.\n[7] Les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi comprennent la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion et la d\u00e9ficience.\nIV. QUELLE EST LA PROPAGANDE ALL\u00c9GU\u00c9E EN L'ESP\u00c8CE? [8] M. Niemi a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le CRARR est un organisme \u00e0 but non lucratif ind\u00e9pendant dont le si\u00e8ge se trouve \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et qui a le mandat de promouvoir l'harmonie et l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les races au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. Entre autres activit\u00e9s, le CRARR m\u00e8ne des recherches, organise des conf\u00e9rences et des s\u00e9minaires et offre de la formation sur la gestion de la diversit\u00e9 ou la fa\u00e7on de s'attaquer \u00e0 la discrimination. Le CRARR fournit \u00e9galement de l'aide individuelle et repr\u00e9sente des personnes qui croient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur leur race, leur religion, leur ethnicit\u00e9 ou un autre motif semblable.\n[9] Le CRARR re\u00e7oit fr\u00e9quemment des lettres de gens du public qui portent \u00e0 son attention des question pr\u00e9sentant un int\u00e9r\u00eat. En mai 2003, une lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e au CRARR pour lui sugg\u00e9rer de visiter un site appel\u00e9 bcwhitepride.com . M. Niemi et ses coll\u00e8gues du CRARR ont regard\u00e9 le site et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis qu'il contrevenait \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi. Ils ont alors pris des mesures pour informer la Commission de l'existence du site Web et ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte concernant les droits de la personne.\n[10] M. Niemi a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, au moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e (le 23 mars 2004), les documents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vus sur un site Web dont la page d'accueil avait une adresse plut\u00f4t complexe : http:\/\/members.odinrage.com\/bcwhitepride. M. Niemi appelle ce site Web bcwhitepride.com . En date de septembre 2004, plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, les documents qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s \u00e0 cette adresse Web avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s sur un autre site Web dont l'adresse \u00e9tait http:\/\/www.bcwhitepride.org. Le texte des pages que M. Niemi avait vues sur le site original avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 tel quel sur le nouveau site, seules quelques modifications avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 l'apparence des pages (comme la police de caract\u00e8res et la mise en page des tableaux). La Commission et le CRARR soutiennent que le site Web .com est simplement devenu le site Web .org et que M. Beck a utilis\u00e9 d'abord le site bcwhitepride.com puis le site bcwhitepride.org pour communiquer la propagande en cause.\n[11] Le site Web (aux deux adresses Internet) affichait un mot de bienvenue aux visiteurs sur la page d'accueil. Il pr\u00e9sentait certain des th\u00e8mes abord\u00e9s dans les autres pages du site en \u00e9non\u00e7ant ce qui suit (tous les extraits tir\u00e9s du site Web que j'ai inclus dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sont reproduits tels quels, sans correction des erreurs typographiques, grammaticales ou autres) :\n[traduction]\nBienvenue chez BC White Pride!\nLa Colombie-Britannique est l'h\u00f4te d'un nouveau mouvement audacieux se consacrant principalement \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation des Blancs sur des questions d'actualit\u00e9 comme l'immigration, le contr\u00f4le des m\u00e9dias, la d\u00e9mographie, l'\u00e9ducation sup\u00e9rieure et la d\u00e9gradation de la culture. Les hommes et les femmes fiers qui font partie de BC White Pride ont pris la d\u00e9cision, en toute connaissance de cause, et apr\u00e8s m\u00fbre r\u00e9flexion de s'unir pour combattre le d\u00e9clin pr\u00e9m\u00e9dit\u00e9 de notre peuple.\nNous sommes des hommes et des femmes d'origine europ\u00e9enne qui luttons pour pr\u00e9server notre race, notre patrimoine et notre culture pour les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations futures. Nous sommes grandement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s par la vague actuelle d'immigration en provenance de pays qui ne sont pas blancs, tant au Canada que dans nos patries europ\u00e9ennes bien-aim\u00e9es.\nNous avons comme objectif d'exposer le monopole \u00e9vident des m\u00e9dias que d\u00e9tiennent les Juifs, qui complotent pour faire avancer le lib\u00e9ralisme, la rectitude politique, le multiculturalisme et le m\u00e9lange des races, ce qui m\u00e8nera \u00e0 l'\u00e9croulement de la moralit\u00e9 et des valeurs familiales de notre fi\u00e8re culture. De plus, nous en avons assez des politiques gouvernementales qui ne servent plus les meilleurs int\u00e9r\u00eats des Blancs, qui ont jadis fond\u00e9 notre grande nation et tant d'autres dans le monde.\nNous esp\u00e9rons vous apprendre les faits que les m\u00e9dias juifs vous cachent et demander votre aide pour prot\u00e9ger l'existence de notre peuple et assurer un avenir aux enfants blancs.\nCette introduction \u00e9tait suivie du passage suivant :\n[traduction]\nLe saviez-vous?\nLes personnes d'origine europ\u00e9enne qui n'ont pas de sang m\u00eal\u00e9 ne constituent plus que 8 % de la population mondiale!\n\u00c0 peine 2 % de la population mondiale est constitu\u00e9e de femmes blanches en \u00e2ge de procr\u00e9er ou plus jeunes!\nLes taux d'avortement et l'usage r\u00e9pandu de la contraception chez les Blancs conjugu\u00e9s au fait que moins de familles blanches ont des enfants a fait descendre le taux de natalit\u00e9 sous le seuil de renouvellement des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations dans le monde!\nLe m\u00e9tissage (le croisement des races) atteint de nouveaux sommets dans toutes les cultures blanches et il est agressivement favoris\u00e9 par les m\u00e9dias juifs comme si leur vie en d\u00e9pendait, au sens propre!\nL'immigration en provenance du tiers monde, si elle n'est pas restreinte, fera de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord, de l'Europe et de l'Australie des r\u00e9gions majoritairement non blanches d'ici le d\u00e9but du prochain si\u00e8cle!\nR\u00e9pondez \u00e0 l'appel de votre peuple qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fier! Aidez-nous \u00e0 faire de notre pays un meilleur endroit pour les familles blanches...\n[12] \u00c0 la gauche de la page se trouvait une colonne \u00e9num\u00e9rant un certain nombre de sujets, lesquels sont en fait des liens menant aux autres pages du site Web. En cliquant sur le sujet, le lecteur voyait appara\u00eetre la page associ\u00e9e. La colonne demeurait visible sur chacune des pages du site Web, ce qui permettait au visiteur de consulter les autres pages en cliquant sur le lien \u00e0 n'importe quel moment, sans avoir \u00e0 revenir \u00e0 la page d'accueil. La colonne contenait les liens suivants :\n[traduction]\nL'immigration\nLes m\u00e9dias\nLes Juifs\nLa politique au Canada\nLa lutte en un coup d'il\nLa sant\u00e9 raciale\nLes solutions\n(i) Le lien [traduction] L'immigration [13] Le lien [traduction] L'immigration amenait le lecteur vers une page comportant un commentaire intitul\u00e9 [traduction] L'\u00e9chec de la politique d'immigration canadienne . La pr\u00e9misse de ce commentaire \u00e9tait que, bien que la politique d'immigration du Canada ait traditionnellement favoris\u00e9 [traduction] les personnes de souche europ\u00e9enne travaillant fort , les ann\u00e9es 1960 ont vu na\u00eetre [traduction] une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration tumultueuse voulant \u00e0 tout prix affaiblir les valeurs traditionnelles du Canada.\n[14] Pour \u00e9tayer ses conclusions, le texte s'appuie sur des chiffres publi\u00e9s par Statistique Canada. Par exemple, il est soutenu que la politique canadienne d'immigration favorise maintenant les immigrants originaires d'Asie plus que de tous les autres lieux de naissance combin\u00e9s \u00e0 partir du chiffre de Statistique Canada selon lequel 53,2 % de toutes les personnes ayant immigr\u00e9 au Canada en 2000 provenaient de la r\u00e9gion Asie et Pacifique . Le commentaire postulait ensuite que la raison de cette [traduction] calamit\u00e9 \u00e9tait que les immigrants de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial constituaient 60 % de tous les immigrants, ce qui ferait que [traduction] les Asiatiques d\u00e9placent la race fondatrice de ce pays \u00e0 un rythme alarmant, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'on leur permet d'amener les membres de leur famille provenant de nations du tiers monde . \u00c0 l'oppos\u00e9, [traduction] les travailleurs hautement qualifi\u00e9s d'Europe sont oblig\u00e9s de subir les rigueurs d'un syst\u00e8me de pointage qui \u00e9value la comp\u00e9tence dans les langues officielles et qui compare l'exp\u00e9rience de travail du demandeur par rapport \u00e0 une liste de m\u00e9tiers en demande au Canada.\n[15] D'autres chiffres sont cit\u00e9s ailleurs dans le commentaire, lesquels chiffres visent \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que pr\u00e8s de 22 % des immigrants arriv\u00e9s en Colombie-Britannique entre 1961 et 1996 provenaient soit de la R\u00e9publique populaire de Chine, de Ta\u00efwan ou de Hong Kong. Cette statistique a incit\u00e9 l'auteur du texte \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer ceci : [traduction] Peut-\u00eatre serait-il temps de rebaptiser la province Colombie-Chinoise. L'auteur de l'article poursuit ensuite en racontant les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par la Colombie-Britannique au d\u00e9but du 20e si\u00e8cle pour emp\u00eacher l'entr\u00e9e d'immigrants d'Asie. L'article reproduit les paroles d'une chanson qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 chant\u00e9e en 1907 par des opposants \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e d'Asiatiques :\n[traduction]\nUnissons-nous et gardons la t\u00eate haute, et soyons aussi forts que nos p\u00e8res qui ont gagn\u00e9 le foyer qui est le n\u00f4tre, pour la terre des hommes blancs nous combattons! \u00c0 la tyrannie et \u00e0 l'avarice orientale nous ne nous soumettrons jamais, non jamais! Un Canada blanc \u00e0 jamais!\nDans l'article, cet extrait est suivi de ce commentaire : [traduction] Si seulement nous poss\u00e9dions le courage collectif de nos anc\u00eatres fondateurs.\n[16] L'article se conclut en affirmant que [traduction] l'extinction pr\u00e9m\u00e9dit\u00e9e des Europ\u00e9ens dans notre grand pays est en cours et que les immigrants qui sont arriv\u00e9s au Canada continueront de r\u00e9colter les fruits de notre labeur jusqu'\u00e0 ce que notre peuple devienne une minorit\u00e9 dans son propre pays . La page Web se termine par la phrase suivante : [traduction] Nous devons prot\u00e9ger l'existence de notre peuple et assurer un avenir pour les enfants blancs!\n(ii) Le lien [traduction] Les m\u00e9dias [17] M. Niemi a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il a visit\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois le site Web bcwhitepride.com en 2003, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 redirig\u00e9 vers une autre page quand il a cliqu\u00e9 sur ce lien. Cependant, quand il a visit\u00e9 le site Web apr\u00e8s que son contenu eut \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 la nouvelle adresse (bcwhitepride.org), il a \u00e9t\u00e9 redirig\u00e9 vers une page intitul\u00e9e [traduction] Le contr\u00f4le des m\u00e9dias en Am\u00e9rique du Nord quand il a cliqu\u00e9 sur le lien [traduction] Les m\u00e9dias .\n[18] L'article sur cette page Web soutient que la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, le cin\u00e9ma et d'autres domaines des m\u00e9dias de masse en Am\u00e9rique du Nord sont [traduction] en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 [...] compl\u00e8tement domin\u00e9s par un groupe de personnes qui, de toute \u00e9vidence, a des objectifs qui ne sont pas repr\u00e9sentatifs de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de la population majoritaire blanche . Le commentaire explique ensuite que [traduction] ces ma\u00eetres tout puissant des m\u00e9dias sont les Juifs [traduction] dans une tr\u00e8s grande proportion et que [traduction] la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des Juifs dans les m\u00e9dias de masse est si \u00e9crasante que [traduction] nous sommes oblig\u00e9s de conclure qu'elle n'est pas uniquement due \u00e0 un simple hasard .\n[19] Cet article d\u00e9crit ensuite les organes d'information que poss\u00e8de la famille Asper au Canada et fournit une liste o\u00f9 figure les noms d'une douzaine de [traduction] Juifs am\u00e9ricains magnats de l'information . Il d\u00e9fend le point de vue selon lequel la mainmise des Juifs sur les m\u00e9dias fa\u00e7onne la politique \u00e9trang\u00e8re am\u00e9ricaine et permet aux int\u00e9r\u00eats juifs plut\u00f4t qu'aux int\u00e9r\u00eats am\u00e9ricains de d\u00e9cider des questions de guerre et de paix. L'article se conclut comme suit :\n[traduction]\nIl serait intol\u00e9rable que de tels pouvoirs soient laiss\u00e9s aux mains d'une quelconque minorit\u00e9 \u00e9trang\u00e8re, dont les valeurs et les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont diff\u00e9rents des n\u00f4tres, mais de permettre aux Juifs, qui nous ont toujours m\u00e9pris\u00e9s par le pass\u00e9, de d\u00e9tenir de tels pouvoirs sur nous \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un suicide de la race. En effet, le fait que tant de personnes blanches ressentent aujourd'hui de la culpabilit\u00e9 raciale et de la haine envers elles-m\u00eames au point de rechercher activement la mort de leur propre race est une cons\u00e9quence d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de la mainmise des Juifs sur les m\u00e9dias. Une fois que nous avons accept\u00e9 et compris le fait que les m\u00e9dias sont domin\u00e9s par les Juifs, nous avons in\u00e9vitablement la responsabilit\u00e9 de faire tout ce qu'il faudra pour mettre fin \u00e0 cette domination. Nous ne devons reculer devant rien pour accomplir notre mission de renverser ce pouvoir imbuvable auquel nous avons permis sans nous en rendre compte de r\u00e9duire nos esprits \u00e0 l'esclavage. Si nous ne parvenons pas \u00e0 d\u00e9truire cette b\u00eate d\u00e9testable, elle \u00e9branlera les fondations m\u00eames de notre race et nous d\u00e9truira de l'int\u00e9rieur.\n(iii) Le lien [traduction] Les Juifs [20] Comme dans le cas de la page [traduction] Les m\u00e9dias , M. Niemi a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de voir la page [traduction] Les Juifs en 2003, mais quand le site Web a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 l'adresse Internet bcwhitepride.org, le lien est devenu fonctionnel. En fait, l'adresse de la page \u00e0 laquelle M. Niemi a \u00e9t\u00e9 redirig\u00e9 quand il a cliqu\u00e9 sur [traduction] Les Juifs \u00e9tait http:\/\/bcwhitepride.org\/juden.htm . L'article qui s'y trouvait s'intitulait [traduction] Une br\u00e8ve histoire des Juifs .\n[21] Le texte conteste [traduction] le consensus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au sein du public voulant que [traduction] des si\u00e8cles de pers\u00e9cution contre les Juifs leur donne droit au statut de victimes et propose que [traduction] pour vraiment comprendre pourquoi les Juifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pers\u00e9cut\u00e9s, nous devons bri\u00e8vement examiner leur histoire en r\u00e9sum\u00e9 . L'article pr\u00e9sente ensuite en d\u00e9tail des d\u00e9clarations prononc\u00e9es au sujet des Juifs et des actions prises \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard au cours de l'histoire. L'article comporte une analyse du r\u00f4le qu'ont jou\u00e9 les Juifs relativement \u00e0 [traduction] l'art du pr\u00eat usuraire , la fondation du communisme et l'\u00e9tablissement d'une [traduction] domination financi\u00e8re internationale men\u00e9e par des familles juives [traduction] ultrariches qui ont achet\u00e9 les entreprises et les banques des [traduction] Gentils par [traduction] des moyens l\u00e9gaux, mais peu scrupuleux .\n[22] Dans ses conclusions, l'article fait part de pr\u00e9occupations sur la fa\u00e7on dont les Juifs [traduction] emploient les vastes pouvoirs et le contr\u00f4le sans limites qu'ils d\u00e9tiennent dans presque tous les domaines de la vie . Il est affirm\u00e9 que [traduction] les nations blanches sont manipul\u00e9es par les Juifs et sont sous leur emprise et qu'il est [traduction] dans le meilleur int\u00e9r\u00eat [des Juifs] de se prot\u00e9ger de ceux qui comprennent leur r\u00f4le dans l'histoire et dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 contemporaine en introduisant la notion de culpabilit\u00e9 des Blancs pour leur pers\u00e9cution [traduction] en se servant des m\u00e9dias et des institutions d'enseignement qui sont sous leur emprise . \u00c0 la fin, il est avanc\u00e9 que [traduction] au fond, il s'agit de la destruction de l'identit\u00e9 et du nationalisme des Blancs .\n(iv) Le lien [traduction] La politique au Canada [23] Cette page Web consiste en un commentaire concernant le Parti lib\u00e9ral du Canada et l'Alliance canadienne\/le Parti r\u00e9formiste. Cet article qualifie de [traduction] tendance inqui\u00e9tante le fait que le Parti lib\u00e9ral [traduction] fasse des pieds et des mains pour faire plaisir aux minorit\u00e9s raciales aux d\u00e9pens de la majorit\u00e9 blanche , tendance qui s'est traduite par la nomination d'Adrienne Clarkson ([traduction] une immigrante de Hong Kong ) au poste de gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Son \u00e9poux, John Ralston Saul, est d\u00e9crit comme un [traduction] tra\u00eetre \u00e0 la race . Le premier ministre Jean Chr\u00e9tien est critiqu\u00e9 pour avoir nomm\u00e9 ministres Rey Pagtakhan ([traduction] un immigrant r\u00e9cent des Philippines ) et Hedy Fry ([traduction] une immigrante non blanche de Trinit\u00e9 ). Les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le gouvernement lib\u00e9ral de l'\u00e9poque visant \u00e0 durcir les peines pour les crimes haineux, \u00e0 lancer chez les jeunes des programmes nationaux de lutte au racisme et \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une strat\u00e9gie nationale de lutte contre la haine et les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s sont critiqu\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant une [traduction] campagne [orchestr\u00e9e par les Lib\u00e9raux] pour nuire \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 blanche .\n[24] Les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par l'Alliance canadienne pour devenir [traduction] plus inclusive politiquement sont \u00e9galement critiqu\u00e9s. Le parti est accus\u00e9 d'\u00eatre [traduction] infiltr\u00e9 par des multiculturalistes aux plus hauts \u00e9chelons . Il est soulign\u00e9 que le fils de l'ancien chef du parti, Stockwell Day, [traduction] a \u00e9pous\u00e9 une femme des Philippines . M. Day est critiqu\u00e9 pour avoir [traduction] m\u00eame utilis\u00e9 ses petits-enfants de race m\u00e9lang\u00e9e dans ses publicit\u00e9s de campagne \u00e9lectorale . L'article conclut que les positions lib\u00e9rales adopt\u00e9es par l'Alliance canadienne sur de nombreuses questions ont [traduction] attir\u00e9 de nombreux repr\u00e9sentants de l'Asie du sud, de l'Asie de l'Est et juifs . Par cons\u00e9quent, [traduction] les Canadiens blancs qui se soucient de la race n'ont pas de v\u00e9ritable choix sur leur bulletin de vote et ils doivent donc adopter [traduction] une position tierce r\u00e9volutionnaire et passer outre le syst\u00e8me politique conventionnel pour r\u00e9soudre leurs probl\u00e8mes.\n(v) Le lien [traduction] La lutte en un coup d'il [25] Cette page Web pr\u00e9tend contenir une liste de courtes descriptions des [traduction] factions les plus importantes et les plus influentes qui ont \u00e9merg\u00e9 depuis [traduction] le renversement id\u00e9ologique des organisations racialistes traditionnelles comme le Parti nazi am\u00e9ricain et le Ku Klux Klan (KKK). L'article explique que ces factions sont n\u00e9es apr\u00e8s [traduction] l'\u00e2ge d'or du Ku Klux Klan . Le lecteur est averti que [traduction] les hommes et les femmes de BC White Pride ont choisi de ne s'affilier \u00e0 aucun des groupes \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s et que ces groupes [traduction] ne repr\u00e9sentent pas n\u00e9cessairement les int\u00e9r\u00eats ou les objectifs de BC White Pride .\n[26] La liste inclut des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences aux sites Web exploit\u00e9s par ces groupes et l'article d\u00e9crit l'un de ces sites comme \u00e9tant [traduction] utiles [...] pour les nouveaux venus au mouvement qui souhaitent se cr\u00e9er un r\u00e9seau et qui veulent s'instruire sur les principaux Canadiens participant \u00e0 la lutte racialiste . Un autre de ces sites Web est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme un [traduction] grand lieu \u00e9lectronique de rencontre pour les Blancs qui se pr\u00e9occupent de la race de partout sur le globe .\n(vi) Le lien [traduction] La sant\u00e9 raciale [27] L'objectif de cette page, selon son paragraphe d'introduction, est de [traduction] pr\u00e9senter des enjeux importants concernant la mort tragique de la sant\u00e9 raciale des blancs \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle mondiale . Cet article est divis\u00e9 en trois segments intitul\u00e9s respectivement [traduction] Le QI et la race , [traduction] L'avortement et la race et [traduction] L'euthanasie et la race .\n[28] Dans la premi\u00e8re section, sur le QI et la race, il est soutenu que [traduction] les fl\u00e9aux sociaux , comme le ch\u00f4mage chronique, la d\u00e9pendance prolong\u00e9e \u00e0 l'aide sociale, la criminalit\u00e9, les m\u00e8res seules et la pauvret\u00e9 diminueraient si l'intelligence de la population pouvait \u00eatre augment\u00e9e. Il est peu probable que cela se produise, comme il est pr\u00e9tendu, car [traduction] la composante g\u00e9n\u00e9tique de l'intelligence se serait d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e par un processus appel\u00e9 [traduction] dysg\u00e9n\u00e9sie , qui r\u00e9sulte de la [traduction] tendance qu'ont les classes les plus intelligentes \u00e0 avoir moins d'enfants , et par [traduction] l'immigration de masse de gens de faible intelligence .\n[29] Ce processus serait plus rapide dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s multiethniques, o\u00f9 certains groupes minoritaires qui ont [traduction] un niveau plus faible d'intelligence ont des taux de [traduction] f\u00e9condit\u00e9 plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que les Blancs. Il est soutenu que les Noirs ont [traduction] un niveau d'intelligence consid\u00e9rablement plus faible que les Blancs et les Asiatiques et que cela [traduction] contribue \u00e0 la surrepr\u00e9sentation des Noirs dans les pathologies sociales que sont la faible r\u00e9ussite scolaire, les m\u00e8res c\u00e9libataires, la criminalit\u00e9, etc. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme le conclut cette section de l'article, parce que [traduction] la sous-classe cognitive continue de [traduction] se reproduire plus rapidement que l'\u00e9lite intellectuelle dans les nations blanches sur toute la plan\u00e8te, le QI moyen des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s blanches continuera de chuter . Ce fait pr\u00e9cipitera le d\u00e9clin des [traduction] grandes civilisations que [traduction] nos anc\u00eatres ont construit en luttant si ardemment . Seule une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui contr\u00f4le agressivement l'immigration et encourage l'adoption de [traduction] politiques de f\u00e9condit\u00e9 visant \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer son stock g\u00e9n\u00e9tique peut faire \u00e9chec \u00e0 la dysg\u00e9nie.\n[30] La section sur l'avortement et la race de cet article conteste les politiques qui permettent l'avortement sur demande. Il est soutenu que, plus souvent qu'autrement, c'est un [traduction] b\u00e9b\u00e9 blanc potentiellement en sant\u00e9 et productif qui est avort\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon le texte, [traduction] l'avortement sur demande est contreproductif dans les nations blanches, particuli\u00e8rement parce que nos taux de natalit\u00e9 ont chut\u00e9 sous le niveau de renouvellement des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations . En cons\u00e9quence, les nations blanches sont incapables de maintenir une base de population [traduction] stable .\n[31] Cependant, cet article ne favorise pas l'interdiction absolue de l'avortement. Les crit\u00e8res pour l'avortement d'un ftus devraient d\u00e9pendre [traduction] principalement de consid\u00e9rations relatives au profit net potentiel que ce futur individu apporterait \u00e0 notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son ensemble . Il est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l'avortement soit disponible pour les ftus non blancs, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 [traduction] l'\u00e9cart bien document\u00e9 des niveaux de QI entre les races et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que [traduction] dans l'ensemble , les ftus non blancs ont [traduction] un impact g\u00e9n\u00e9tique total n\u00e9gatif sur notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 . Cet article promeut \u00e9galement l'avortement quand le ftus est [traduction] difforme et quand il na\u00eetra avec une d\u00e9ficience mentale ou physique grave.\n[32] Cela m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la troisi\u00e8me section de l'article, sur l'euthanasie et la race, o\u00f9 il est affirm\u00e9 que les personnes [traduction] gravement retard\u00e9es ou handicap\u00e9es du cerveau ne constituent pas [traduction] des contributeurs nets de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, mais [sont] un poids tragique pour leur famille et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'ensemble. Les d\u00e9fenseurs des citoyens handicap\u00e9s font l'objet de critiques pour juger \u00e9quivalents les droits [traduction] m\u00eame des personnes les plus gravement retard\u00e9es et ceux de l'\u00e9lite cognitive . Il est soutenu que ces personnes handicap\u00e9es devraient \u00eatre euthanasi\u00e9es et que cela aura un impact sur [traduction] la question raciale parce qu'il y a peu de chances que les couples blancs [traduction] r\u00e9duits \u00e0 l'esclavage par des enfants gravement handicap\u00e9s aient plus d'enfants blancs. L'article condamne le fait que [traduction] les lois actuelles sur l'avortement autorisent le meurtre pr\u00e9m\u00e9dit\u00e9 [de] ftus blancs potentiellement en sant\u00e9 et productifs , alors qu'il est ill\u00e9gal de [traduction] tuer une personne gravement retard\u00e9e ou handicap\u00e9e du cerveau qui aura constamment besoin de soins aux frais des contribuables pour la dur\u00e9e de sa vie inutile et que l'acte est passible d'une peine de prison \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9. En outre, l'article pr\u00e9tend que si les fonds pr\u00e9sentement [traduction] mal attribu\u00e9s consacr\u00e9s au soin des personnes gravement handicap\u00e9es \u00e9taient d\u00e9pens\u00e9s pour [traduction] diminuer les imp\u00f4ts des familles nombreuses , les Blancs seraient incit\u00e9s \u00e0 avoir plus d'enfants en sant\u00e9. En pr\u00e9sentant ses arguments \u00e0 ce sujet, l'article d\u00e9signe les personnes [traduction] gravement handicap\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des [traduction] parasites , des [traduction] primates ignorants et des [traduction] r\u00e9gressions g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques .\n[33] Bref, comme le conclut l'article, les politiques visant \u00e0 r\u00e9duire les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s naturelles entre les individus et les peuples ne sont pas seulement contreproductives, mais elles constituent du gaspillage compte tenu [traduction] de la courbe en forme de cloche des attributs se produisant naturellement dans toute population biologique . Il est soutenu que l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 est [traduction] un mythe avanc\u00e9 par ceux qui veulent nous dissuader d'exercer notre pr\u00e9rogative instinctive d'\u00e9liminer du troupeau les b\u00eates les plus faibles .\n(vii) Le lien [traduction] Les solutions [34] Cet article pr\u00e9tend offrir des r\u00e9ponses aux lecteurs qui auraient pu se demander ce qu'ils pouvaient faire pour [traduction] aider leur [traduction] race en p\u00e9ril . Une des suggestions \u00e9tait de cesser de s'appuyer sur la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et les journaux comme sources d'information. Il \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t recommand\u00e9 de faire sa propre recherche sur Internet. Il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'on peut trouver plus de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en faisant une enqu\u00eate ind\u00e9pendante sur l'Internet qu'en regardant la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision ou en lisant [traduction] votre quotidien juif .\n[35] Une autre solution propos\u00e9e est de r\u00e9pandre [traduction] notre message d'espoir et de nous aider \u00e0 r\u00e9\u00e9duquer les Blancs qui ont succomb\u00e9 aux id\u00e9ologies propag\u00e9es par les m\u00e9dias non ind\u00e9pendants . Il est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que cela peut se faire en s'adressant \u00e0 des amis [traduction] dont l'\u00e9tat d'esprit peut \u00eatre compatible avec les objectifs de notre cause . Le lecteur est \u00e9galement incit\u00e9 \u00e0 imprimer plusieurs pamphlets, qui pouvaient \u00eatre consult\u00e9s et lus sur le site Web, pour qu'ils soient [traduction] l\u00e9galement distribu\u00e9s [traduction] dans les biblioth\u00e8ques, les institutions d'enseignement et les parcs de stationnement .\n[36] La Commission a produit deux de ces pamphlets en preuve. Le premier prend la forme d'un avis de personne disparue. Il comporte la photo d'une jeune fille blanche. Le texte accompagnant la photo est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\n[traduction]\nDISPARU\nUn avenir pour les enfants blancs!\nDescription : Cheveux blonds, roux ou bruns, peau p\u00e2le, innocente, curieuse, intelligente, fait confiance aux gens. Les politiciens ultralib\u00e9raux et les groupes d'int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux minoritaires ont kidnapp\u00e9 son avenir. Elle n'aura aucun avenir dans le Canada multiculturel que notre gouvernement a planifi\u00e9. Reprenons possession de notre pays pour qu'il redevienne formidable, propre, d\u00e9cent et beau, pour le bien de nos enfants. Les hommes et les femmes de BC White Pride veulent que vous vous joigniez \u00e0 ce grand effort patriotique.\nJoignez-vous d\u00e8s aujourd'hui \u00e0 BC White Pride!\nAidez-nous \u00e0 faire de notre pays un meilleur endroit pour les familles blanches.\nwww.bcwhitepride.com\n[37] Le second pamphlet contenait une photo d'une m\u00e8re blanche avec trois enfants blancs. La page \u00e9tait couronn\u00e9e du titre BC WHITE PRIDE . Le texte encadrant la photo \u00e9tait celui-ci : [traduction] Nous devons prot\u00e9ger l'existence de notre peuple et assurer un avenir pour les enfants blancs. Au bas du pamphlet apparaissait le texte suivant :\n[traduction]\nNe croyez-vous pas que notre patrimoine et notre mode de vie valent la peine d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9serv\u00e9s?\nJoignez-vous d\u00e8s aujourd'hui \u00e0 BC White Pride!\nAidez-nous \u00e0 faire de notre pays un meilleur endroit pour les familles blanches.\nwww.bcwhitepride.com\n[38] Dans les marges gauche et droite du pamphlet, on peut voir huit courts messages. Seule une portion de ces messages est visible sur la version imprim\u00e9e produite en preuve. Un de ces messages semble dire que [traduction] les taux de natalit\u00e9 des Blancs sont bien en dessous du niveau de renouvellement des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, alors que les taux de natalit\u00e9 des non-Blancs atteignent de nouveaux sommets . Un autre affirme que [traduction] au d\u00e9but du prochain si\u00e8cle, la plupart des pays blancs auront une minorit\u00e9 blanche , tandis qu'un autre dit que [traduction] nos m\u00e9dias sont presque enti\u00e8rement sous l'emprise d'un petit groupe de personnes qui n'a pas l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de la population blanche en t\u00eate .\nV. ANALYSE A. Les articles soul\u00e8vent-ils des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les membres des groupes identifiables sur la base d'un motif \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 3, au sens du paragraphe 13(1)? [39] Dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy c. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a conclu que le terme haine connote des sentiments comportant une malice extr\u00eame envers une autre personne ou un autre groupe de personnes. Quand on dit qu'on hait quelqu'un, c'est qu'on ne lui trouve aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te ses d\u00e9fauts. Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 que m\u00e9pris sugg\u00e8re que l'on regarde quelqu'un de haut ou qu'on le traite comme s'il \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur. Les deux termes ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement de la m\u00eame nature. La haine dans certains cas peut \u00eatre le r\u00e9sultat de l'envie de qualit\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures comme l'intelligence, la richesse et le pouvoir, ce que le m\u00e9pris ne peut \u00eatre par d\u00e9finition.\n[40] Le Tribunal dans l'affaire Nealy a aussi mentionn\u00e9 que l'utilisation du terme susceptible au paragraphe 13(1) signifie qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver que l'effet sera que les personnes qui entendent la propagande dirigeront leur haine ou leur m\u00e9pris contre d'autres. Il n'est pas non plus n\u00e9cessaire de prouver que, en fait, une personne a ainsi \u00e9t\u00e9 victime.\n[41] Ces conclusions ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9es par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892. La Cour supr\u00eame a ajout\u00e9 que les termes haine et m\u00e9pris utilis\u00e9s au paragraphe 13(1) font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des \u00e9motions extr\u00eamement fortes et profondes de d\u00e9testation, de calomnie et de diffamation.\n[42] J'estime que les articles affich\u00e9s sur les sites Web bcwhitepride.com et bcwhitepride.org soul\u00e8vent des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris les membres de groupes identifiables, au sens du paragraphe 13(1) tel que la jurisprudence l'interpr\u00e8te.\n[43] Les articles pr\u00e9tendent repr\u00e9senter le point de vue de ceux qui [traduction] d\u00e9fendent la cause des [traduction] hommes et femmes fiers qui sont regroup\u00e9s pour [traduction] lutter contre le d\u00e9clin pr\u00e9m\u00e9dit\u00e9 des peuples [traduction] d'origine europ\u00e9enne . Mais en pr\u00e9sentant ce point de vue, les personnes qui ne sont pas blanches et les personnes handicap\u00e9es sont trait\u00e9es comme des personnes dont la valeur et la contribution \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sont moindres que celles des personnes blanches. En m\u00eame temps, les Juifs sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme une puissante menace \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, responsable de beaucoup de ses fl\u00e9aux. Bref, toute personne n'appartenant pas au nous dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats seraient d\u00e9fendus par le site Web est trait\u00e9e avec de la haine ou du m\u00e9pris extr\u00eame.\n(i) De quelle fa\u00e7on les articles exposent-ils les personnes non blanches \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris? [44] Comme la Commission l'a soutenu de fa\u00e7on convaincante \u00e0 l'audience, les commentaires qui exposent les personnes non blanches \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris dans les articles sont \u00e0 la fois pr\u00e9cis et g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment affirm\u00e9 dans l'article sur la sant\u00e9 raciale que les Noirs ont [traduction] un niveau d'intelligence consid\u00e9rablement plus faible que les Blancs et les Asiatiques et que cela [traduction] contribue \u00e0 la surrepr\u00e9sentation des Noirs dans les pathologies sociales que sont la faible r\u00e9ussite scolaire, les m\u00e8res seules, la criminalit\u00e9, etc. Les Noirs sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant une [traduction] sous-classe cognitive . Dans ces d\u00e9clarations, les Noirs sont m\u00e9pris\u00e9s et sont trait\u00e9s en inf\u00e9rieurs. En outre, les commentaires lient le pr\u00e9tendu manque d'intelligence des Noirs avec des [traduction] pathologies sociales comme la criminalit\u00e9. Comme l'a fait observer le Tribunal dans Warman c. Kouba, 2006 TCDP 50 (Kouba), aux paragraphes 45 et 46, tenir un groupe identifiable responsable des probl\u00e8mes actuels de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est un th\u00e8me distinctif de la propagande haineuse.\n[45] D'une mani\u00e8re plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les Blancs sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme des personnes sup\u00e9rieures aux autres [traduction] races et de plus grande valeurs. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'avortement de ftus blancs est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ind\u00e9sirable alors qu'il est acceptable pour les autres. Il est affirm\u00e9 que les ftus non blancs ont [traduction] un impact g\u00e9n\u00e9tique total n\u00e9gatif sur notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qu'il faudrait donc faire des efforts pour favoriser leur avortement. Cette affirmation laisse fortement entendre que la vie des personnes noires ne vaut essentiellement rien et les Noirs y sont donc trait\u00e9s avec m\u00e9pris.\n[46] Cette question de l'inf\u00e9riorit\u00e9 des non-Blancs est r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e dans les nombreux passages o\u00f9 il est question de l'immigration au Canada. Les non-Blancs sont d\u00e9crits comme des personnes ind\u00e9sirables dont l'entr\u00e9e au pays est une [traduction] calamit\u00e9 qu'il faut restreindre. Dans l'article sur l'immigration, il est \u00e9voqu\u00e9 avec tendresse une \u00e9poque de l'histoire du Canada o\u00f9 les immigrants asiatiques \u00e9taient trait\u00e9s comme des \u00eatres de seconde classe et o\u00f9 \u00e9taient lanc\u00e9s des appels \u00e0 la lutte pour lib\u00e9rer [traduction] la terre des hommes blancs de [traduction] la tyrannie et [de] l'avarice orientale . Ce th\u00e8me de la lutte raciale ou de la guerre contre les attaques des non-Blancs est renforc\u00e9e par des allusions au fait que les Blancs seraient [traduction] assi\u00e9g\u00e9s et craindraient [traduction] l'extinction des Europ\u00e9ens. Ceux qui encouragent l'immigration non blanche au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne sont critiqu\u00e9s et ceux qui s'associent \u00e0 eux sont appel\u00e9s des [traduction] tra\u00eetres \u00e0 la race . Les d\u00e9clarations incitant [traduction] un peuple qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fier \u00e0 se soulever et, comme le dit le pamphlet intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Disparu , \u00e0 reprendre [traduction] possession de notre pays ressemble \u00e0 un appel aux armes. Comme l'a fait observer le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Kouba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 76 et 77, les appels \u00e0 la violence contre un groupe identifiable constituent un autre th\u00e8me distinctif de la propagande haineuse.\n[47] Le message dans le pamphlet intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Disparu veut qu'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui accepte le multiculturalisme cesse d'\u00eatre [traduction] formidable, propre, d\u00e9cent[e] et be[lle] et devienne une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans laquelle l'avenir des enfants blancs est menac\u00e9. Cette inqui\u00e9tude par rapport \u00e0 l'avenir des enfants blancs renforce l'id\u00e9e que la pr\u00e9sence de personnes non blanches met en danger le bien-\u00eatre des enfants blancs. Il est ainsi sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que les Blancs devraient \u00e9prouver des sentiments profonds de d\u00e9testation envers ceux qui nuiraient et attaqueraient le bien-\u00eatre des enfants blancs, c'est-\u00e0-dire les non-Blancs. D\u00e9crire un groupe identifiable comme s'attaquant aux enfants ou \u00e0 d'autres personnes vuln\u00e9rables est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l'article 13 comme un autre signe r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur de la propagande haineuse (voir la d\u00e9cision Kouba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 40 et 41).\n(ii) De quelle fa\u00e7on les articles exposent-ils les Juifs \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris? [48] Le Tribunal, dans la d\u00e9cision Kouba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 24 et 25, a soulign\u00e9 qu'un des th\u00e8me distinctifs de la propagande haineuse, tels que relev\u00e9s dans la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l'article 13 de plus en plus abondante, est de d\u00e9crire un groupe identifiable comme constituant une menace qui prend le contr\u00f4le des principales institutions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui prive les autres de leur gagne-pain, de leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de leur libert\u00e9 de parole et de leur bien-\u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de cette fa\u00e7on que les Juifs sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sur le site Web.\n[49] Dans l'article sur les Juifs, par exemple, il est soutenu que les Juifs utilisent [traduction] les vastes pouvoirs et le contr\u00f4le sans limite qu'ils d\u00e9tiennent dans presque tous les domaines de la vie pour manipuler [traduction] les nations blanches , ce qui entra\u00eene la destruction [traduction] de l'identit\u00e9 et du nationalisme des Blancs . La pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e mainmise des Juifs sur les m\u00e9dias est mentionn\u00e9e de nombreuses fois dans l'article en utilisant des expressions forg\u00e9es comme [traduction] m\u00e9dias juifs (Jewsmedia en anglais) et [traduction] quotidien juif (Jewspaper en anglais ). Selon l'article sur les m\u00e9dias, [traduction] permettre aux Juifs de [traduction] d\u00e9tenir de tels pouvoirs sur nous \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un suicide de la race . Les Juifs sont donc d\u00e9crits comme constituant une menace r\u00e9elle et dangereuse pour les Blancs. Fait encore plus d\u00e9concertant, l'article semble lancer un appel \u00e0 l'action concr\u00e8te, et m\u00eame \u00e0 la violence, dans le but de [traduction] renverser ce pouvoir imbuvable et de [traduction] d\u00e9truire cette b\u00eate d\u00e9testable , qui \u00e9branle les [traduction] fondations m\u00eames de notre race et qui nous d\u00e9truira de l'int\u00e9rieur .\n[50] Ces d\u00e9clarations r\u00e9v\u00e8lent nettement des forts sentiments de d\u00e9testation et constituent de la diffamation envers les Juifs. Elles cr\u00e9ent des conditions propices \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris envers les Juifs en incitant le public \u00e0 d\u00e9tester les Juifs parce qu'ils sont manipulateurs et menacent les int\u00e9r\u00eats des autres et en ne leur attribuant en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aucune qualit\u00e9 qui peut racheter leurs d\u00e9fauts (voir Smith c. Western Guard Party, 1979 CanLII 1 (T.C.D.P.); Citron c. Zundel (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/27, aux paragraphes 139 et 140).\n[51] On peut \u00e9galement constater que, dans les articles en question, des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant authentiques, tels que ceux visant \u00e0 associer les Juifs au d\u00e9veloppement d'activit\u00e9s douteuses comme le pr\u00eat usuraire et le communisme, sont utilis\u00e9s pour faire des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations n\u00e9gatives, une pratique qui, selon la jurisprudence, expose les membres d'un groupe identifiable \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris (voir Kouba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 32).\n[52] En outre, il est fait montre de m\u00e9pris envers les Juifs quand est d\u00e9shumanis\u00e9e la fa\u00e7on dont ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pers\u00e9cut\u00e9s. Les Juifs sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 l'origine de l'antis\u00e9mitisme. Les victimes sont en fait tenues responsables de la discrimination dont elles ont fait l'objet et, ce faisant, les cons\u00e9quences de la discrimination sont att\u00e9nu\u00e9es. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que la banalisation des pers\u00e9cutions ou trag\u00e9dies pass\u00e9es cr\u00e9e un climat de d\u00e9rision et de m\u00e9pris susceptible d'exposer les membres du groupe vis\u00e9 \u00e0 ces \u00e9motions (voir Kouba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 72 \u00e0 75).\n(iii) De quelle fa\u00e7on les articles exposent-ils les personnes handicap\u00e9es \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris? [53] Il ne fait aucun doute que les questions soulev\u00e9es dans l'article sur l'euthanasie et la race exposent les personnes handicap\u00e9es \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris. D'abord, les personnes ayant une grave d\u00e9ficience mentale ou physique sont trait\u00e9es avec m\u00e9pris extr\u00eame au moyen de propos incendiaires et d\u00e9sobligeants qui les pr\u00e9sentent comme des personnes grandement inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 [traduction] l'\u00e9lite cognitive (voir Kouba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 67). Elles sont qualifi\u00e9es de [traduction] parasites , de [traduction] primates ignorants , de [traduction] r\u00e9gressions g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques , d'\u00eatres [traduction] g\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement inf\u00e9rieurs et de [traduction] b\u00eates les plus faibles qu'il faut [traduction] \u00e9liminer du troupeau .\n[54] L'article pr\u00e9sente le point de vue selon lequel les personnes [traduction] gravement retard\u00e9es ou handicap\u00e9es du cerveau ne constituent pas [traduction] des contributeurs nets de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 , mais sont plut\u00f4t un [traduction] poids tragique pour leurs familles et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les lois autorisant l'avortement de [traduction] ftus blancs en sant\u00e9 et productifs , mais criminalisant le meurtre de personnes gravement retard\u00e9es ou handicap\u00e9es du cerveau qui auront constamment besoin de soins pour le reste de leur vie [traduction] inutile sont critiqu\u00e9es. Il est \u00e9vident que le message v\u00e9hicul\u00e9 par ces remarques est que les personnes handicap\u00e9es valent moins que les personnes blanches et qu'elles ne m\u00e9ritent donc pas de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des m\u00eames droits fondamentaux, notamment le droit \u00e0 la vie. Les personnes handicap\u00e9es, de par leur existence m\u00eame, sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es comme causant un dommage au reste de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, car elles constituent un poids [traduction] parasitique . Il est difficile d'imaginer que des commentaires puissent \u00eatre plus susceptibles d'exposer les personnes handicap\u00e9es \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n(iv) Conclusion : Les articles soul\u00e8vent des questions susceptibles d'exposer des groupes identifiables \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. [55] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour r\u00e9sumer, je conclus que les articles trouv\u00e9s sur les sites Web bcwhitepride.com et bcwhitepride.org soul\u00e8vent des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 (soit la race, la couleur, la religion, l'origine nationale ou ethnique et la d\u00e9ficience).\nB. Les messages ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi? [56] Le Tribunal a conclu par le pass\u00e9 que les documents affich\u00e9s sur Internet sont, de par les caract\u00e9ristiques intrins\u00e8ques du m\u00e9dium, communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, particuli\u00e8rement quand aucun obstacle n'est mis en place pour emp\u00eacher quiconque se branchant \u00e0 l'Internet de naviguer jusqu'\u00e0 un site Web et de consulter les documents (voir Warman c. Beaumont, 2007 TCDP 49, aux paragraphes 51 \u00e0 57; Warman c. Harrison, 2006 TCDP 30, au paragraphe 44;Warman c. Kulbashian, 2006 TCDP 11, au paragraphe 62;Warman c. Tremaine, 2007 TCDP 2, aux paragraphes 116 \u00e0 119). M. Niemi a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de consulter les documents simplement en tapant l'adresse Internet des sites Web. En cliquant sur les liens du site Web, il a pu lire les diff\u00e9rents articles qui constituent la propagande en cause.\n[57] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que les articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e.\nC. Qui a communiqu\u00e9 les messages en cause? (i) John Beck a-t-il communiqu\u00e9 les messages en cause? [58] Les sites Web sont identifi\u00e9s par des noms de domaine (p. ex. : bcwhitepride.org) qui sont enregistr\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s d'un service d'enregistrement des noms de domaine (voir la d\u00e9cision Kulbashian, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 66). Le public peut obtenir des renseignements concernant l'identit\u00e9 des personnes ayant inscrit le site au moyen de sites Web comme whois.net . La personne ayant inscrit le site bcwhitepride.com, en date d'ao\u00fbt 2004, \u00e9tait NOLDC Inc. , dont l'adresse \u00e9tait situ\u00e9e \u00e0 la Nouvelle-Orl\u00e9ans, en Louisiane. Aucun nom d'individu n'apparaissait dans les documents fournis. Pour ce qui est de bcwhitepride.org, la personne ayant inscrit ce site en date de mai 2005 \u00e9tait Domains by Proxy Inc. , dont l'adresse \u00e9tait situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Scottsdale, en Arizona.\n[59] Des preuves concernant les recherches sur le site whois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites lors de l'audition de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. Les parties m'ont demand\u00e9 d'examiner la transcription de cette audience et de prendre en consid\u00e9ration cette preuve dans mon examen du fond de la plainte. \u00c0 l'audience pr\u00e9liminaire, des t\u00e9moignages ont port\u00e9 sur la facilit\u00e9 avec laquelle une personne enregistrant un site Web peut inscrire de faux renseignements quant \u00e0 son nom et \u00e0 son adresse lors de l'enregistrement.\n[60] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission pr\u00e9tend que les renseignements d'enregistrement concernant bcwhitepride.com et bcwhitepride.org sont trompeurs et que M. Beck est en fait la personne qui a r\u00e9ellement affich\u00e9 les articles en question sur Internet, sur ces sites Web. Afin d'\u00e9tablir le lien entre M. Beck et les articles, la Commission a produit une s\u00e9rie de courriers \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9chang\u00e9s en mars 2004, entre un individu nomm\u00e9 Shane Martinez et quelqu'un utilisant l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique renegade1488ca@yahoo.com . La Commission a appel\u00e9 M. Martinez \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience. Ce dernier a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait impliqu\u00e9 dans [traduction] une \u00e9tude sur les droits de la personne et [traduction] l'activisme pour la justice sociale depuis plus d'une d\u00e9cennie. Dans le cadre de son travail, il m\u00e8ne des recherches sur les activit\u00e9s des [traduction] mouvements militant pour la supr\u00e9matie blanche sur Internet.\n[61] M. Martinez a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, au d\u00e9but de 2004, il a d\u00e9couvert un site Web appel\u00e9 whiterenegade.com au cours de ses recherches. Il a voulu conna\u00eetre l'identit\u00e9 de la personne ou des personnes responsables de ce site Web, alors il a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 l'adresse de contact fournie par le site Web en pr\u00e9tendant \u00eatre une femme nomm\u00e9e Rachel qui affirmait s'int\u00e9resser au contenu du site. M. Martinez a re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse de quelqu'un utilisant l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique renegade1488ca@yahoo.com, laquelle personne pr\u00e9cisait que son v\u00e9ritable nom \u00e9tait John . L'\u00e9change de courriers \u00e9lectroniques entre John et Rachel (c'est-\u00e0-dire M. Martinez) a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus tard suivi d'une s\u00e9rie de discussions par messagerie instantan\u00e9e (clavardage) entre ces deux personnes. Dans un des courriers \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9chang\u00e9s, John a \u00e9crit qu'il affichait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des messages sous le pseudonyme (nom d'utilisateur) Renegade sur un babillard \u00e9lectronique exploit\u00e9 par un site Web appel\u00e9 stormfront.org.\n[62] \u00c0 l'ouverture de l'audience sur le fond de la plainte, M. Fromm, au nom de M. Beck, a admis que ce dernier \u00e9tait bel et bien la personne qui avait communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Martinez dans ces courriers \u00e9lectroniques et discussions en ligne en utilisant l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique renegade1488ca@yahoo.com. M. Beck a \u00e9galement reconnu que les copies des courriers \u00e9lectroniques et des discussions en ligne imprim\u00e9es par M. Martinez \u00e9taient authentiques et n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es. Ces d\u00e9clarations concordent avec les conclusions tir\u00e9es par le membre du Tribunal Deschamps dans sa d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire en l'esp\u00e8ce. Cependant, M. Beck n'a pas admis que les d\u00e9clarations qu'il avait exprim\u00e9es dans ces \u00e9changes \u00e9taient en fait vraies.\n[63] La Commission pr\u00e9tend que, compte tenu de ce qu'a \u00e9crit M. Beck dans ces courriers \u00e9lectroniques et ces discussions en ligne, il est \u00e9vident qu'il est l'auteur et le communicateur des articles en cause en l'esp\u00e8ce. Par exemple, dans un courrier \u00e9lectronique envoy\u00e9 le 8 mars 2004, M. Martinez a louang\u00e9 le travail fait sur le site Web whiterenegade.com et a demand\u00e9 si whiterenegade \u00e9tait \u00e9galement le nom d'un groupe. M. Beck a r\u00e9pondu :\n[traduction]\nLe site whiterenegade.com est mon propre manifeste personnel en ligne. Ce n'est pas un groupe. Par contre, j'ai cofond\u00e9 un groupe appel\u00e9 BC White Pride. J'ai contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction d'une bonne partie du contenu du site www.bcwhitepride.com.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[64] M. Fromm a soutenu qu'il ne faut pas faire grand cas de cette affirmation de M. Beck. D'abord, la signification de [traduction] une bonne partie du contenu n'est pas claire. M. Beck \u00e9tait-il l'auteur des articles? Et s'il l'\u00e9tait, dans quelle proportion? En d\u00e9clarant qu'il avait [traduction] contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction du contenu, M. Beck voulait-il dire qu'il a apport\u00e9 des corrections au texte ou qu'il l'a nettoy\u00e9 en tant qu'\u00e9diteur? Ou peut-\u00eatre a-t-il fourni \u00e0 l'auteur des documents de recherche? Cependant, M. Beck n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et n'a produit aucune preuve pour expliquer quelles pouvaient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 les limites de sa participation.\n[65] Au contraire, la Commission soutient que la preuve circonstancielle \u00e9tablit que M. Beck est l'auteur des documents. La Commission a relev\u00e9 un certain nombre de similitudes assez frappantes et de th\u00e8mes communs entre d'une part les messages en cause et d'autre part les d\u00e9clarations de M. Beck dans ses courriers \u00e9lectroniques et ses discussions en ligne ainsi que dans les articles qu'il a affich\u00e9s sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique de stormfront.org. La Commission soutient que cette preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire fait en sorte qu'il est plus probable que M. Beck ait \u00e9crit et affich\u00e9 les messages en cause que M. Beck ne l'ait pas fait. Les similitudes all\u00e9gu\u00e9es sont les suivantes :\nDans les \u00e9changes avec M. Martinez, M. Beck utilise un certain nombre de termes peu communs, qui apparaissent \u00e9galement dans les articles en cause, notamment dans les exemples suivants :\n\u00b0 Dans une discussion en ligne, M. Beck a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il est f\u00e2ch\u00e9 que son \u00e9glise ait permis \u00e0 une m\u00e8re autochtone et \u00e0 ses enfants, dont le p\u00e8re est blanc, d'assister \u00e0 la messe. M. Beck consid\u00e8re que cette situation est dangereuse parce que sa pr\u00e9sence dans l'\u00e9glise favoriserait une attitude de [traduction] tol\u00e9rance fanatique . La m\u00eame expression est utilis\u00e9e dans les articles en cause, sous le lien [traduction] La sant\u00e9 raciale , dans la partie consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'euthanasie, o\u00f9 il est \u00e9crit :\n[traduction]\nEncore plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les d\u00e9fenseurs des droits des handicap\u00e9s savent bien quelles sont les r\u00e9percussions psychologiques du fait de conditionner les gens pour qu'ils acceptent et subventionnent leurs homologues g\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement inf\u00e9rieurs et les int\u00e8grent \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. [...] L'\u00e9tat d'esprit propag\u00e9 par ces lib\u00e9raux pathologiques favorise une philosophie de tol\u00e9rance fanatique.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n\u00b0 Dans la partie [traduction] La politique au Canada des articles en cause, l'ancienne gouverneure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale Adrienne Clarkson est d\u00e9crite comme une immigrante de Hong Kong qui a \u00e9pous\u00e9 le [traduction] tra\u00eetre \u00e0 la race John Ralston Saul. De m\u00eame, dans un courrier \u00e9lectronique envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Martinez, M. Beck a \u00e9crit : [traduction] Si un homme blanc \u00e9pouse une Juive au nez crochu et se convertit au juda\u00efsme, il est un tra\u00eetre \u00e0 la race. La m\u00eame expression a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e dans un article affich\u00e9 en 2007 par Renegade sur stormfront.org, dans lequel les personnes voulant adopter [traduction] dans une autre race sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme des [traduction] tra\u00eetres potentiels \u00e0 la race . Comme je l'ai not\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, M. Beck avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Martinez qu'il affichait des articles sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique de stormfront.org en utilisant le pseudonyme Renegade.\nLa pr\u00e9occupation exprim\u00e9e dans la partie [traduction] La sant\u00e9 raciale des articles en cause au sujet de la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9tique de certaines [traduction] classes et de la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de leur [traduction] stock g\u00e9n\u00e9tique est un th\u00e8me que M. Beck aborde \u00e9galement dans les courriers \u00e9lectroniques qu'il a envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Martinez. Ainsi, M. Beck a \u00e9crit dans un message :\n[traduction]\nNous pouvons faire preuve de respect envers les races non blanches en ne nous approchant pas de leurs femmes, m\u00eame si EXCEPTIONNELLEMENT L'UNE d'entre elles est tr\u00e8s belle. Ainsi, nous aidons notre race en n'introduisant pas d'ADN \u00e9tranger \u00e0 notre patrimoine g\u00e9n\u00e9tique et en plus nous commettons un acte de bonne volont\u00e9 envers elles.\nDe mani\u00e8re semblable, M. Beck a \u00e9crit sous le pseudonyme Renegade, dans un article affich\u00e9 en 2007 sur stormfront.org, qu'il d\u00e9sapprouvait le fait que les non-Blancs \u00e9pousent des Blancs dans le but [traduction] d'am\u00e9liorer leur stock g\u00e9n\u00e9tique , ce qui constitue selon lui une exploitation de la race blanche [traduction] pour leur propre avantage .\nLe document se trouvant sous le lien [traduction] Les solutions des articles en cause portait principalement sur [traduction] l'avenir des nos enfants blancs . Les pamphlets pouvant \u00eatre t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9s comportaient des photos d'enfants blancs et le message selon lequel les [traduction] ultralib\u00e9raux et les groupes d'int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux minoritaires ont kidnapp\u00e9 [leur] avenir . M. Beck, dans ses discussions en ligne avec M. Martinez, a montr\u00e9 qu'il portait lui aussi un int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier \u00e0 l'avenir des enfants blancs. M. Beck souligne que son pasteur avait quatre adolescents [traduction] blancs et parfaits et que lui-m\u00eame avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un [traduction] mentor pour ces [traduction] jeunes Blancs \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise . Il pr\u00e9tend les avoir subtilement instruits et conseill\u00e9s sur les questions de race en d\u00e9montrant beaucoup d'affection aux enfants blancs, mais en n'accordant aucune attention aux [traduction] b\u00e2tards de la m\u00e8re autochtone. M. Beck affirme esp\u00e9rer que les adolescents blancs [traduction] impressionnables aient constat\u00e9 ce favoritisme et qu'ils suivront son exemple.\nDans la partie [traduction] La sant\u00e9 raciale des articles en cause, il est soutenu que les personnes [traduction] gravement retard\u00e9es et handicap\u00e9es du cerveau devraient \u00eatre euthanasi\u00e9es. De fa\u00e7on semblable, M. Beck a \u00e9crit dans un article affich\u00e9 sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique de stormfront.org, sous le pseudonyme Renegade, qu'il appuyait l'id\u00e9e de rendre obligatoire l'euthanasie dans les cas o\u00f9 [traduction] un \u00eatre humain vibrant, productif et en sant\u00e9 devient un [traduction] l\u00e9gume gravement handicap\u00e9 .\n[66] La Commission soutient que l'on peut de plus identifier M. Beck comme l'auteur et le communicateur des articles en question \u00e0 partir du contenu du site Web whiterenegade.com. Comme je l'ai expliqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, M. Beck s'est vant\u00e9 du fait que whiterenegade.com \u00e9tait son propre [traduction] manifeste personnel en ligne . La Commission soutient que ce site Web contient des documents qui sont presque identiques \u00e0 ceux en cause en l'esp\u00e8ce. Par exemple :\nSur whiterenegade.com, dans l'article portant sur l'avortement et [traduction] le probl\u00e8me des pro-choix , il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit ceci :\n[traduction]\nDe nombreuses \u00e9tudes montrent que 90 % des avortements ont lieu pour ce qui peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de raisons de commodit\u00e9. Nous estimons que c'est r\u00e9pugnant parce que, plus souvent qu'autrement, c'est un b\u00e9b\u00e9 blanc, potentiellement en sant\u00e9 et productif, qui est avort\u00e9. La liste d'attente pour l'adoption de b\u00e9b\u00e9s blancs en sant\u00e9 est d'environ sept ans. C'est bien trop long. Ce temps d'attente pourrait \u00eatre spectaculairement r\u00e9duit si plus de restrictions \u00e9taient impos\u00e9es \u00e0 l'avortement.\nUn texte presque identique appara\u00eet dans les articles en cause trouv\u00e9s sur bcwhitepride.com, dans la section [traduction] L'avortement et la race de l'article [traduction] La sant\u00e9 raciale . J'ai soulign\u00e9 les parties du texte qui sont identiques \u00e0 celui trouv\u00e9 sur whiterenegade.com :\n[traduction]\nDe nombreuses \u00e9tudes montrent que la plupart des avortements ont lieu pour ce qui peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de raisons de commodit\u00e9. Plus souvent qu'autrement, c'est un b\u00e9b\u00e9 blanc, potentiellement en sant\u00e9 et productif, qui est avort\u00e9. Inversement, la liste d'attente pour l'adoption de b\u00e9b\u00e9s blancs en sant\u00e9 est d'environ sept ans. Ce temps d'attente pourrait \u00eatre spectaculairement r\u00e9duit si plus de restrictions \u00e9taient impos\u00e9es \u00e0 l'avortement.\nAilleurs sur le site whiterenegade.com, il est soutenu qu'il existe un lien entre les questions raciales et les points de vue exprim\u00e9s sur le site Web au sujet de l'euthanasie :\n[traduction]\nComment tout cela se rattache-t-il \u00e0 la race? Il est moins probable que les couples blancs r\u00e9duits \u00e0 l'esclavage par un enfant gravement handicap\u00e9 aient plus d'enfants blancs.\nUn texte presque identique (voir les parties soulign\u00e9es) appara\u00eet dans les articles en cause sur bcwhitepride.com :\nComment tout cela se rapporte-t-il \u00e0 la question raciale? Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il est moins probable que les couples blancs r\u00e9duits \u00e0 l'esclavage par des enfants gravement handicap\u00e9s aient plus d'enfants blancs.\n[67] Ce ne sont que quelques exemples. J'estime qu'en d'autres endroits aussi les deux sites Web pr\u00e9sentaient des textes quasi identiques. En outre, les articles affich\u00e9s sur les deux sites Web abordent des th\u00e8mes communs. Dans une section intitul\u00e9e [traduction] L'amour et la haine sur whiterenegade.com, une liste d'[traduction] exemples d'amour d'un point de vue du militantisme blanc inclut l'amour des [traduction] adorables enfants blancs , ce qui concorde avec la tendresse envers les enfants blancs d\u00e9montr\u00e9e sur les sites bcwhitepride.com et bcwhitepride.org. La liste de chose d\u00e9test\u00e9es sur Whiterenegade.com comprenait [traduction] le fait que les Juifs dominent nos m\u00e9dias, l'industrie du divertissement, le gouvernement et le syst\u00e8me scolaire et que cette domination \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9e pour [traduction] affaiblir et d\u00e9truire la race blanche . Un autre fait abhorr\u00e9 est celui que [traduction] la vie humaine est profan\u00e9e en branchant des victimes d'une blessure au cerveau pour les maintenir en vie , ce qui transforme [traduction] des \u00eatres humains vibrants et en sant\u00e9 en l\u00e9gumes gravement handicap\u00e9s . Ce sont des th\u00e8mes qui se retrouvent \u00e9galement dans les articles en cause affich\u00e9s sur bcwhitepride.com et bcwhitepride.org.\n[68] La Commission souligne \u00e9galement que, dans les courriers \u00e9lectroniques et les discussions en ligne, M. Beck affirme faire partie d'un groupe appel\u00e9 BC White Pride et fait allusion \u00e0 [traduction] nous, les membres de bcwp et \u00e0 [traduction] mon ami de bcwp . Il se d\u00e9crit comme le cofondateur du groupe un certain nombre de fois.\n[69] \u00c0 mon avis, il peut en fait \u00eatre conclu, \u00e0 partir de l'affirmation de M. Beck selon laquelle il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 [traduction] une bonne partie du contenu de bcwhitepride.com ainsi qu'\u00e0 partir des liens et similarit\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus avec les autres articles de M. Beck, qu'il est l'auteur et la personne qui a utilis\u00e9 ou fait utiliser l'Internet pour communiquer les articles en cause. Compte tenu de ma conclusion pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente selon laquelle les articles en cause constituent de la propagande haineuse vis\u00e9e par l'article 13 de la Loi, cette conclusion, si on lui ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de M. Beck (Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la p. 558 (O'Malley). Il incombe \u00e0 M. Beck de fournir une explication raisonnable d\u00e9montrant qu'il n'y a pas eu discrimination tel qu'all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (par exemple, qu'il n'est pas celui qui a commis les actes discriminatoires) ou que l'acte n'\u00e9tait pas d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre discriminatoire.\n[70] Comme je l'ai affirm\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, M. Beck a choisi de ne pas t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience et il n'a appel\u00e9 aucun t\u00e9moin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. Nulle part dans la preuve dont je dispose M. Beck nie \u00eatre celui qui a affich\u00e9 les articles en cause ou \u00eatre celui qui les a \u00e9crit et je ne dispose d'aucune preuve pr\u00e9cisant quel r\u00f4le moindre M. Beck aurait pu jouer tout en ayant [traduction] contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction des articles, comme l'a laiss\u00e9 entendre M. Fromm dans ses observations. Le dernier argument, de toute fa\u00e7on, constituerait une explication douteuse, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que m\u00eame un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de violation de l'article 13 pour avoir utilis\u00e9 ou fait utiliser l'Internet pour communiquer de la propagande haineuse.\n[71] M. Fromm a \u00e9galement soutenu que les opinions exprim\u00e9es sur le site whiterenegade.com sont d'une certaine fa\u00e7on plus nuanc\u00e9es que les articles affich\u00e9s sur bcwhitepride.com et ne contreviennent pas \u00e0 l'article 13. Il pr\u00e9tend que, par cons\u00e9quent, je devrais conclure que M. Beck n'\u00e9tait pas l'auteur des articles en cause qui se trouvaient sur le site Web bcwhitepride.com. Je rejette cet argument. D'abord, la question de savoir si les articles se trouvant sur whiterenegade.com contrevenaient \u00e0 l'article 13 n'est pas une question que je dois trancher en l'esp\u00e8ce. Fait encore plus important, je ne vois aucune raison de conclure que, simplement parce que le deuxi\u00e8me texte ne contient qu'une partie du premier, quelqu'un d'autre doit n\u00e9cessairement avoir \u00e9crit le reste du premier texte. Il ne s'agit que d'une hypoth\u00e8se. Il n'y a simplement aucune preuve \u00e9tayant cette affirmation.\n[72] En outre, M. Fromm soutient que M. Martinez a recueilli sa preuve d'une mani\u00e8re contraire \u00e0 l'\u00e9thique et qu'il est r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible pour la Commission de s'appuyer sur des documents obtenus \u00e0 la suite d'une enqu\u00eate aussi [traduction] sordide . M. Fromm a particuli\u00e8rement contest\u00e9 le fait que M. Martinez ait adopt\u00e9 une fausse identit\u00e9 et envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Beck plusieurs photographies d'une femme qu'il avait t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9es d'Internet sans le consentement de la femme. M. Martinez a envoy\u00e9 ces photos \u00e0 M. Beck en pr\u00e9tendant qu'elles \u00e9taient le v\u00e9ritable portrait de la Rachel fictive afin d'\u00eatre plus convaincant dans le personnage f\u00e9minin qu'il avait adopt\u00e9 dans ses communications.\n[73] Je ne vois pas comment les m\u00e9thodes utilis\u00e9es par M. Martinez peuvent servir de r\u00e9ponse ou d'explication raisonnable \u00e0 la preuve prima facie qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie contre M. Beck. Peu importe les m\u00e9thodes de M. Martinez, le fait demeure que c'est M. Beck qui a \u00e9crit les messages dans ces courriers \u00e9lectroniques et ces discussions en ligne, en utilisant l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique renegade1488ca@yahoo.com, et qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir affich\u00e9 des articles sur stormfront.org, sous le pseudonyme Renegade .\n[74] M. Fromm pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que M. Martinez n'est pas un t\u00e9moin fiable, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ses activit\u00e9s au sein de mouvements [traduction] antiracistes et sa participation \u00e0 des manifestations contre certains individus, dont M. Fromm. Cependant, la question de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Martinez concernant la preuve qu'il a produite quant au contenu des courriers \u00e9lectroniques et des discussions en ligne a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l'objet d'une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire rendue dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Le Tribunal a conclu que la transcription des courriers \u00e9lectroniques et des discussions en ligne n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e et qu'elle \u00e9tait authentique et fiable , un fait que M. Fromm, au nom de M. Beck, a \u00e9galement reconnu \u00e0 l'audience. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l'authenticit\u00e9 des documents a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Martinez est essentiellement sans importance.\n[75] Je conviens avec M. Fromm que de nombreux messages de M. Beck dans les courriers \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9chang\u00e9s d\u00e9montrent qu'il croyait sinc\u00e8rement discuter avec une jeune femme qui semblait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper une relation personnelle avec lui. M. Fromm soutient que M. Beck pourrait avoir embelli ses commentaires pour cette raison, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'il se d\u00e9crivait et lorsqu'il d\u00e9crivait ses activit\u00e9s, juste pour impressionner Rachel . Cependant, M. Beck n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ni produit aucune preuve pour expliquer quelles auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 ces fausses d\u00e9clarations, ni si elles comprennent les passages que j'ai mis en \u00e9vidence. Je ne dispose d'aucune preuve contredisant les aveux expr\u00e8s de M. Beck dans ses courriers \u00e9lectroniques et ses discussions en lignes. De plus, beaucoup de ces discussions, qui ont eu lieu en 2004, comportent des messages semblables \u00e0 ceux que M. Beck a affich\u00e9s sur le site stormfront.org en 2007, apr\u00e8s que la plainte eut \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et bien apr\u00e8s que ses conversations avec la Rachel fictive eurent cess\u00e9. Rien devant moi ne laisse entendre que M. Beck tentait d'impressionner quiconque avec les articles qu'il a r\u00e9cemment affich\u00e9s sur stormfront.org.\n[76] Je rejette \u00e9galement l'observation de M. Fromm selon laquelle M. Beck aurait subi un certain pr\u00e9judice du fait que la Commission n'avait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 avant l'audience quelles parties des articles affich\u00e9s sur bcwhitepride.com elle avait l'intention d'utiliser comme preuve de violation de l'article 13. Je soulignerais que les articles trouv\u00e9s sur bcwhitepride.com, qui ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9s sur bcwhitepride.org, semblaient compter au total moins de 30 pages imprim\u00e9es, ce qui ne constitue pas une preuve particuli\u00e8rement volumineuse, \u00e0 mon avis. M. Beck n'a pas soutenu que la Commission ou le CRARR ont omis de lui communiquer ces pages avant l'audience.\n[77] En outre, la plupart des documents que j'ai cit\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u00e9vidence par M. Niemi dans son t\u00e9moignage, avaient \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s, ou il y avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait allusion, dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le CRARR en 2004 et dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la Commission et du CRARR, dat\u00e9 du 14 novembre 2006. L'audience sur le fond de la plainte a commenc\u00e9 le 18 juin 2007. M. Beck peut difficilement pr\u00e9tendre avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pris par surprise \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. De toute fa\u00e7on, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la taille relativement petite du site Web bcwhitepride.com (moins de 30 pages, comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9), je ne crois pas que M. Beck ait subi un quelconque pr\u00e9judice du fait que M. Niemi ait \u00e9galement relev\u00e9 un certain nombre de passages qui n'\u00e9taient pas express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9s dans le formulaire de la plainte ou dans l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, mais qui \u00e9taient de nature semblable. M. Beck savait que la Commission contestait le contenu du site Web dans son ensemble. Je suis convaincu que cette information suffisait pour que M. Beck sache quelle preuve il devait r\u00e9futer. Rien ne prouve que M. Beck a subi un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l'audience.\n[78] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime qu'aucune explication raisonnable n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie contre M. Beck. Je conclus que M. Beck a utilis\u00e9 l'Internet pour communiquer de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e les articles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant de la propagande haineuse au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi. La plainte contre M. Beck est donc fond\u00e9e.\n(ii) Le site bcwhitepride.com a-t-il communiqu\u00e9 les articles en cause? [79] M. Niemi a lu pour la premi\u00e8re fois les articles en cause sur un site Web dont la page d'accueil avait l'adresse Internet suivante, telle qu'elle appara\u00eet au bas des pages imprim\u00e9es produites en preuve : http:\/\/members.odinarage\/bcwhitepride. Le CRARR a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte contre la personne ou les personnes directement responsables du site Web, bien que l'adresse inscrite sur le formulaire de la plainte \u00e9tait un peu plus complexe (members.odinarage\/bcwhitepride\/immigrations.htm). Le CRAAR a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans sa plainte que le site Web \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00e9galement connu sous le nom de BCWhitepride.com . Dans un formulaire tap\u00e9 intitul\u00e9 R\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte que la Commission a par la suite rempli, les nom et adresse du\/de la mis(e) en cause donn\u00e9s ne sont que www.bcwhitepride.com . Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, personne n'a comparu devant le Tribunal au nom de bcwhitepride.com.\n[80] Fait plus important, je ne dispose d'aucune preuve \u00e9tablissant l'existence m\u00eame de bcwhitepride.com en tant que personne ou groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi. La preuve \u00e9tablit seulement que, en 2003, il \u00e9tait possible de consulter un site Web dont l'adresse Internet (members.odinarage\/bcwhitepride\/immigrations.htm) comprenait le terme bcwhitepride . Dans sa d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire, le membre du Tribunal Deschamps a conclu qu'un groupe s'appelant BC White Pride existait bel et bien. Cependant, comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j'ai rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de la Commission visant \u00e0 faire ajouter ce groupe en tant que partie.\n[81] \u00c0 mon avis, il appara\u00eet clairement que le nom bcwhitepride.com mentionn\u00e9 dans la plainte visait un site Web, une version simplifi\u00e9e d'une adresse Internet plut\u00f4t complexe, et que le CRARR voulait d\u00e9poser une plainte contre les personnes responsables du site, et non contre le site Web comme tel. En outre, m\u00eame si on acceptait la d\u00e9signation de www.bcwhitepride.com en tant que partie intim\u00e9e comme l'a fait la Commission dans son r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que bcwhitepride.com existe en tant que personne ou groupe de personnes, au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi, capable de commettre l'acte discriminatoire dont il est question en l'esp\u00e8ce. La plainte contre bcwhitepride.com n'est donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e.\n[82] Je noterais \u00e9galement en passant que, dans ses observations finales, la Commission a inform\u00e9 le tribunal qu'elle ne r\u00e9clamait aucune r\u00e9paration de www.bcwhitepride.com.\nVI. R\u00c9PARATIONS A. Ordonnance de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte (alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) [83] La Commission et le CRARR demandent une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 M. Beck de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) de la Loi. Compte tenu de ma conclusion selon laquelle M. Beck a communiqu\u00e9 de la propagande haineuse en violation de l'article 13 de la Loi, une telle ordonnance est justifi\u00e9e.\n[84] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 John Beck de cesser d'aborder, de la fa\u00e7on d\u00e9crite \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, soit au moyen de l'Internet, toute question du type que contenaient les articles qui, selon ce que j'ai conclu dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, sont susceptibles d'exposer une personne ou un groupe de personne \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris du fait que cette personne ou ce groupe de personne est identifiable sur la base d'un des motifs de discrimination prohib\u00e9s.\n[85] M. Niemi a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait pu consulter les articles sur le site Web bcwhitepride.org aussi r\u00e9cemment qu'en novembre 2006. Si les articles sont encore accessibles, il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Beck de retirer les documents contrevenant \u00e0 l'article 13 du site Web bcwhitepride.org ou de tout autre site Internet o\u00f9 M. Beck a affich\u00e9 ces articles.\nB. Sanction p\u00e9cuniaire (alin\u00e9a 54(1)c)) [86] Le Tribunal peut imposer \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e qui a commis un acte discriminatoire en violation de l'article 13 de la Loi une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire d'au plus 10 000 $, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c). Le paragraphe 54(1.1) \u00e9num\u00e8re plusieurs facteurs dont le Tribunal doit tenir compte lorsqu'il d\u00e9cide de rendre une telle ordonnance :\nla nature et la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que les circonstances l'entourant;\nla nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte, les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de la partie intim\u00e9e et sa capacit\u00e9 de payer.\nLa Commission soutient que ces facteurs favorisent fortement la [traduction] sanction p\u00e9cuniaire maximale autoris\u00e9e .\n[87] Pour ce qui est du premier ensemble de crit\u00e8res, j'estime que l'acte discriminatoire en l'esp\u00e8ce constitue une violation grave et importante de l'article 13 de la Loi. De toute \u00e9vidence, les articles en cause sont discriminatoires \u00e0 l'endroit d'une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de personnes et comportent des commentaires qui sont d\u00e9prav\u00e9s et d\u00e9shumanisants, surtout ceux \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes handicap\u00e9es, un groupe particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rable de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes n\u00e9gatifs et destructeurs visant les Juifs sont mis de l'avant. Les remarques concernant les personnes non blanches portent atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'estime de soi et contribuent \u00e0 semer la discorde entre diff\u00e9rents groupes raciaux et culturels, ce qui, comme l'a statu\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 au paragraphe 42, mine la tol\u00e9rance et l'ouverture d'esprit qui doivent fleurir dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 multiculturelle vou\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. Je soulignerais \u00e9galement que les articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur un site Web qui semblait consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'affichage des articles en question, ce qui diff\u00e9rencie la pr\u00e9sente affaire d'autres cas o\u00f9 la propagande est constitu\u00e9e d'un certain nombre de messages relativement courts affich\u00e9s sur des babillards \u00e9lectroniques (voir, par exemple, Warman c. Beaumont, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 au paragraphe 98).\n[88] De plus, je suis convaincu que M. Beck a affich\u00e9 intentionnellement ces articles sur Internet en sachant que la communication de ces documents \u00e9tait susceptible d'exposer les personnes de groupes identifiables \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris et qu'il contreviendrait ainsi \u00e0 la Loi. Par exemple, sur le site whiterenegade.org, que M. Beck a qualifi\u00e9 de [traduction] manifeste personnel en ligne , il a fait part de sa [traduction] sainte haine passionn\u00e9e des lois interdisant la propagande haineuse. Dans ses \u00e9changes avec M. Martinez, M. Beck a parl\u00e9 de son m\u00e9pris envers ceux qui souhaitent mettre fin au genre de d\u00e9clarations qui se trouvent sur les sites Web bcwhitepride.com et bcwhitepride.org. \u00c0 mon sens, il est raisonnable de conclure \u00e0 partir de ces affirmations que M. Beck connaissait les dispositions de la Loi concernant la propagande haineuse, mais qu'il a n\u00e9anmoins choisi en toute conscience d'y contrevenir.\n[89] Rien ne prouve que M. Beck ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d'actes discriminatoires. Les propos affich\u00e9s sur les sites bcwhiterenegade.org et stormfront.org, bien qu'ils aient servi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la participation de M. Beck aux sites bcwhitpride.com et bcwhitepride.org, ne font pas l'objet de la plainte concernant l'article 13 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le CRARR et les parties intim\u00e9es n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e que ces documents allaient \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le but de prouver l'existence d'autres messages discriminatoires. Ce serait manquer \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale due \u00e0 M. Beck que d'examiner si ces autres documents constituent un acte discriminatoire selon la Loi. En outre, je n'ai aucune fa\u00e7on de savoir si les documents affich\u00e9s sur bcwhiterenegade.org ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s avant les articles en cause en l'esp\u00e8ce. De toute \u00e9vidence, tous les articles affich\u00e9s sur stormfront.org en 2007 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s bien apr\u00e8s.\n[90] Certaines preuves portent sur la capacit\u00e9 de M. Beck \u00e0 payer la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire. Au cours de l'audition de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire visant \u00e0 modifier la plainte, la Commission a produit des copies des d\u00e9clarations de revenus alors les plus r\u00e9centes de M. Beck, soit pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 et 2005. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je r\u00e9v\u00e8le les montants exacts qui y figurent, mais il suffit de dire que le revenu total qu'il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s modeste. En outre, M. Martinez a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience que, selon les renseignements qu'il avait recueillis au cours de son enqu\u00eate, M. Beck habitait dans un [traduction] garage , un fait qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] enti\u00e8rement corrobor\u00e9 par une recherche faite dans un annuaire en ligne, le 411.ca . Cela dit, je ne dispose d'aucune preuve quant \u00e0 l'actif et au passif de M. Beck ni quant \u00e0 son revenu en 2007.\n[91] Compte tenu de tous ces facteurs, j'ordonne \u00e0 M. Beck de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 6 000 $. Cette sanction doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 ou par mandat \u00e0 l'ordre du Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et le Tribunal doit le recevoir dans les 120 jours suivant la date \u00e0 laquelle la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Beck.\nC. Indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin [92] M. Beck a demand\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin \u00e0 la Commission pour sa pr\u00e9sence, r\u00e9partie sur huit jours au total, \u00e0 l'audition de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire visant \u00e0 faire modifier la plainte, dont le r\u00e9sultat a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'ajout de M. Beck en tant qu'intim\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce. La Commission avait demand\u00e9 au Tribunal et obtenu une sommation de compara\u00eetre pour obliger M. Beck \u00e0 compara\u00eetre les 27 et 28 novembre 2006 \u00e0 l'audience qui devait avoir lieu \u00e0 Penticton, en Colombie-Britannique. La Commission a signifi\u00e9 la sommation de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 M. Beck par huissier, de m\u00eame qu'une somme de 50 $. M. Beck a comparu \u00e0 l'audience aux dates pr\u00e9vues. Cependant, l'ouverture de la proc\u00e9dure a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e au deuxi\u00e8me jour, le 28 novembre 2006, en raison de mauvaises conditions climatiques qui ont retard\u00e9 l'arriv\u00e9e du membre instructeur du Tribunal.\n[93] L'audition de la requ\u00eate s'est poursuivie sur sept jours au total (les 28, 29 et 30 novembre 2006 ainsi que du 10 au 13 avril 2007). M. Beck \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 chacune de ces dates, bien qu'aucune autre sommation de compara\u00eetre ne lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9. En fin de compte, M. Beck n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[94] M. Beck demande maintenant une indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin pour sa pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 l'audience pour la p\u00e9riode totale de huit jours. Il demande \u00e9galement que lui soient rembours\u00e9s ses frais quotidiens de d\u00e9placement, car il a fait l'aller-retour en voiture de chez lui, \u00e0 Kelowna, situ\u00e9e \u00e0 60 km du lieu de l'audience, ainsi que ses frais de stationnement quotidiens de 4 $. Il demande \u00e9galement que lui soit accord\u00e9e une indemnit\u00e9 pour ses repas du midi.\n[95] Le paragraphe 50(6) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que toute personne assign\u00e9e \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e0 une audience a droit, \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation du membre instructeur, de recevoir les frais et indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9s aux t\u00e9moins assign\u00e9s devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. En Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la pratique est r\u00e9gie par les articles 42 et 43 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, lesquelles pr\u00e9voient qu'un t\u00e9moin a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin et aux frais de d\u00e9placement selon le montant pr\u00e9vu au tarif A des R\u00e8gles. L'article 3 du Tarif \u00e9nonce qu'il peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 de 20 $ par jour plus les frais de d\u00e9placement raisonnables, ou une indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e dans des circonstances similaires pour une comparution devant la cour sup\u00e9rieure de la province o\u00f9 il compara\u00eet si cette indemnit\u00e9 est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e.\n[96] L'audience o\u00f9 a comparu M. Beck s'est tenue en Colombie-Britannique. L'annexe 3 de l'appendice C des r\u00e8gles de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en vertu de la Court Rules Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 80, pr\u00e9cise l'indemnit\u00e9 payable aux t\u00e9moins dans cette province. Les t\u00e9moins ont droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin quotidienne de 20 $. Cependant, un t\u00e9moin qui est une partie ou un agent, directeur ou associ\u00e9 actuel d'une partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure n'a pas droit \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9. Au moment o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, M. Beck n'\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 la plainte. Je ne dispose d'aucune preuve me permettant de conclure qu'il \u00e9tait un agent, un directeur ou un associ\u00e9 de la seule partie intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, bcwhitepride.com, laquelle, selon ce que j'ai conclu, ne constitue pas de toute fa\u00e7on une personne ou un groupe de personnes au sens de l'article 13. M. Beck n'est devenu une partie au litige qu'\u00e0 la suite de la d\u00e9cision, rendue par M. Deschamps le 18 mai 2007, de modifier la plainte.\n[97] L'annexe 3 pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que, si l'audience a lieu \u00e0 moins de 200 km de la r\u00e9sidence du t\u00e9moin, ce dernier peut recevoir une allocation de d\u00e9placement de 30 cents par kilom\u00e8tre. Une allocation raisonnable pour les frais de repas est \u00e9galement payable.\n[98] La Commission a produit, avec ses observations, une copie des taux kilom\u00e9triques du Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada applicables \u00e0 l'utilisation de v\u00e9hicules priv\u00e9s conduits lors de d\u00e9placements autoris\u00e9s dans le cadre des affaires du gouvernement pour la p\u00e9riode couvrant les deux premiers jours de l'audience de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. Le taux en vigueur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque pour les d\u00e9placements en Colombie-Britannique \u00e9tait de 47,5 cents le kilom\u00e8tre.\n[99] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'ajuster le montant payable \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin en fonction des circonstances de chaque affaire (voir Day c. Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale, 2003 TCDP 7). J'estime que les taux pour les frais de d\u00e9placement du Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor seraient raisonnables en l'esp\u00e8ce. Je note \u00e9galement que l'indemnit\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par les r\u00e8gles de la cour sup\u00e9rieure de Colombie-Britannique est moins \u00e9lev\u00e9e, donc, selon les R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, elles ne s'appliquent pas.\n[100] J'accueille la demande de M. Beck visant \u00e0 obtenir une indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin pour toute la p\u00e9riode de huit jours. La Commission n'a jamais fait savoir qu'elle ne l'appellerait pas \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, pas plus qu'elle n'a demand\u00e9 que la sommation de compara\u00eetre soit retir\u00e9e ou annul\u00e9e, comme l'a soulign\u00e9 M. Deschamps quand la question de l'indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e le dernier jour de l'audition de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire (voir la transcription, 13 avril 2007, aux pages 925 \u00e0 942). Je prends note que, dans le formulaire de citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre du Tribunal, que la Commission a rempli et signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Beck, il est \u00e9crit que la personne assign\u00e9e \u00e0 compara\u00eetre doit compara\u00eetre pour t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience au lieu et \u00e0 l'heure indiqu\u00e9s, et ce, tous les jours suivants jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'audience soit termin\u00e9e ou que le Tribunal en d\u00e9cide autrement . Le Tribunal n'a jamais ordonn\u00e9 que M. Beck soit lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de l'obligation de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audition de la requ\u00eate et la Commission n'a pas demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de le faire.\n[101] La Commission soutient que M. Beck a choisi de compara\u00eetre tous les jours parce que la principale question en litige \u00e9tait de savoir s'il devait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 en tant que partie. M. Beck aurait tr\u00e8s bien pu choisir se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'audience m\u00eame s'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 somm\u00e9 de compara\u00eetre, mais le fait demeure qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e0 la demande de la Commission et qu'il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de cette obligation \u00e0 aucun moment au cours de l'audition de la requ\u00eate.\n[102] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 la Commission de payer \u00e0 M. Beck une indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin et de lui rembourser les frais qu'il a engag\u00e9s, selon les montants suivants :\nUne indemnit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin quotidienne de 20 $ x 8 jours = 160 $\n120 km (aller-retour de la r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 l'audience) x 47,5 cents x 8 jours d'audience = 456 $\n4 $ de stationnement x 8 jours d'audience = 32 $\n15 $ par jour (ce que je consid\u00e8re comme \u00e9tant un montant raisonnable pour les frais de repas du midi) x 8 jours d'audience = 120 $\nLa somme que devra payer la Commission \u00e0 M. Beck est donc celle-ci :\n768 $ - 50 $ (le montant qui, d'apr\u00e8s ce que j'ai compris, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Beck quand on lui a signifi\u00e9 sa sommation de compara\u00eetre) = 718 $\nAthanasios D.

QUELLES MESURES DE REDRESSEMENT CONVIENT-IL D'ORDONNER EN L'ESP\u00c8CE?\nVII. ORDONNANCE\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Ali Tahmourpour est un Canadien musulman qui est n\u00e9 en Iran. Il a toujours r\u00eav\u00e9 de devenir policier.\n[2] Le 12 juillet 1999, il a eu la chance de r\u00e9aliser son r\u00eave. Ce jour-l\u00e0, il est entr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC), connue sous le nom de D\u00e9p\u00f4t, \u00e0 Regina, en Saskatchewan. Le 20 octobre 1999, le contrat de formation de M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9 avant que celui-ci n'ait termin\u00e9 le programme. M. Tahmourpour croit que la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat de formation \u00e9tait l'aboutissement de trois mois de harc\u00e8lement et de discrimination fond\u00e9s sur sa race, sa religion et son origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[3] M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), le 21 mars 2001, dans laquelle il pr\u00e9tend qu'il y a eu violation des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nII. UN APER\u00c7U DE LA PLAINTE [4] M. Tahmourpour soutient que, d\u00e8s son premier jour de formation au D\u00e9p\u00f4t, il a re\u00e7u un traitement particulier d\u00e9favorable en raison de sa religion, de sa race et de son origine nationale ou ethnique. Il affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ridiculis\u00e9 pour avoir port\u00e9 un pendentif religieux et pour avoir sign\u00e9 son nom en \u00e9criture persane. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 continuellement la cible de harc\u00e8lement verbal, de traitement hostile et d'\u00e9valuations de rendement d\u00e9favorables par ses instructeurs. Il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 une diminution de sa confiance en soi et de ses capacit\u00e9s \u00e0 apprendre et \u00e0 faire preuve des habilet\u00e9s requises au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Lorsque M. Tahmourpour s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'un des instructeurs qui le traitait d\u00e9favorablement, l'instructeur en question a mont\u00e9 une campagne visant \u00e0 le faire expulser du D\u00e9p\u00f4t. \u00c0 la demande pressante de cet instructeur, M. Tahmourpour a fait l'objet d'\u00e9valuations de rendement d\u00e9favorables et inexactes, ce qui a finalement men\u00e9 \u00e0 son renvoi du programme de formation. Le dernier acte discriminatoire a eu lieu, selon M. Tahmourpour, quand la GRC lui a ni\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le programme sur la base d'une \u00e9valuation inexacte de sa stabilit\u00e9 mentale.\n[5] M. Tahmourpour est d'avis que le traitement d\u00e9favorable dont il a fait l'objet \u00e9tait le fruit d'une discrimination syst\u00e9mique contre les minorit\u00e9s visibles au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Selon lui, cette discrimination syst\u00e9mique au D\u00e9p\u00f4t se traduisait par l'inaction de la GRC relativement \u00e0 la culture d'irrespect et de n\u00e9gativit\u00e9 visant les cadets de minorit\u00e9s visibles au D\u00e9p\u00f4t, de sorte que le taux d'attrition chez les cadets de minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e9tait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que chez les cadets n'appartenant pas \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles.\n[6] La GRC a ni\u00e9 qu'il existait de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique au D\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Tahmourpour s'y trouvait. La GRC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le rendement de M. Tahmourpour au D\u00e9p\u00f4t avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re juste et qu'il ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux attentes. Son contrat de formation a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9 pour la simple raison qu'il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 satisfaire aux normes du D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que son contrat \u00e9tait r\u00e9sili\u00e9, la r\u00e9action n\u00e9gative de M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 cette nouvelle a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il ne savait pas r\u00e9agir aux situations difficiles. Par cons\u00e9quent, la GRC avait raison d'ins\u00e9rer une note dans son dossier pour recommander que M. Tahmourpour ne soit pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 pour \u00eatre r\u00e9admis.\n[7] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure. Cependant, elle est demeur\u00e9e partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure et a fait savoir qu'elle s'int\u00e9ressait \u00e0 toute proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9liminaire, proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9solution, de mise en uvre ou de contr\u00f4le judiciaire qui pourrait s'ensuivre.\nIII. QUELLES SONT LES QUESTIONS PROPRES \u00c0 LA PR\u00c9SENTE PLAINTE? [8] M. Tahmourpour soutient que les incidents suivants se sont produits et qu'ils constituent du harc\u00e8lement ainsi qu'une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9s sur la race, la religion et l'origine nationale ou ethnique :\nM. Tahmourpour a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible de commentaires discriminatoires, de traitement hostile et de violence verbale de la part des instructeurs au D\u00e9p\u00f4t; le rendement de M. Tahmourpour au D\u00e9p\u00f4t n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 correctement; l'intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9sili\u00e9 le contrat de formation de M. Tahmourpour sur de faux pr\u00e9textes; M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 tort comme \u00e9tant inadmissible \u00e0 une r\u00e9inscription au Programme d'instruction des cadets au D\u00e9p\u00f4t; M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite alors qu'il \u00e9tait au D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n[9] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que la plainte de M. Tahmourpour est fond\u00e9e.\nIV. QUE FAUT-IL PROUVER RELATIVEMENT \u00c0 L'ARTICLE 7? [10] L'article 7 de la Loi \u00e9nonce que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de d\u00e9favoriser un individu.\n[11] Il incombe d'abord au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en raison de sa race, de sa religion et de son origine nationale ou ethnique. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28 (O'Malley); et Dhanjal c. Air Canada, (1997), 139 F.T.R. 37, au paragraphe 6).\n[12] Le fardeau passe ensuite \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable montrant que l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ne s'est pas produit tel qu'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que l'acte \u00e9tait d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre non discriminatoire (Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), 2005 CAF 154, au paragraphe 26). Le Tribunal doit ensuite \u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, si les all\u00e9gations de discrimination ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9es.\nA. M. Tahmourpour a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible de commentaires discriminatoires, de traitement hostile et de violence verbale? (a) La mention du pendentif religieux de M. Tahmourpour\n[13] Le 12 juillet 1999, M. Tahmourpour s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 son premier jour de conditionnement physique au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. L'instructeur, le sergent Paul H\u00e9bert (aujourd'hui surintendant), a ordonn\u00e9 aux cadets de se changer pour mettre leurs v\u00eatements d'entra\u00eenement et d'enlever tout bijou ou montre. M. Tahmourpour est all\u00e9 parler au sergent H\u00e9bert pour lui expliquer qu'il portait un pendentif religieux et qu'il ne voulait pas l'enlever. Le sergent H\u00e9bert a r\u00e9pondu que c'\u00e9tait acceptable.\n[14] M. Tahmourpour a demand\u00e9 au sergent H\u00e9bert de ne pas parler de son pendentif religieux, car il ne voulait pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment en raison de son appartenance religieuse. M. Tahmourpour a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'il avait demand\u00e9, le sergent H\u00e9bert a annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les cadets de la Troupe 4 que [traduction] aucun bijou ne peut \u00eatre port\u00e9 durant le conditionnement physique, sauf pour Ali ici pr\u00e9sent, qui a le droit de porter son pendentif religieux. Il affirme que le sergent H\u00e9bert a formul\u00e9 ce commentaire d'une voix forte et sur un ton sarcastique et condescendant, tout en roulant les yeux en direction de M. Tahmourpour.\n[15] M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, pendant plusieurs jours apr\u00e8s cet incident, ses camarades de troupe lui ont pos\u00e9 des questions sur sa religion et lui ont demand\u00e9 pourquoi il portait un pendentif. Il a soutenu que ces questions l'avaient rendu mal \u00e0 l'aise et qu'il craignait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tiquet\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant diff\u00e9rent.\n[16] Le 14 octobre 1999, M. Tahmourpour a eu une conversation avec le sergent H\u00e9bert au cours de laquelle le sergent H\u00e9bert a demand\u00e9 pardon pour son commentaire au sujet du pendentif religieux. Selon M. Tahmourpour, le sergent H\u00e9bert a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'avenir, il emploierait une m\u00e9thode diff\u00e9rente pour r\u00e9pondre aux demandes d'exemption pour le port de bijoux religieux.\n[17] Les instructions relatives au code vestimentaire et aux r\u00e8gles d'hygi\u00e8ne de la GRC donn\u00e9es aux cadets \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait au D\u00e9p\u00f4t pr\u00e9cisaient qu'aucun bijou ne pouvait \u00eatre port\u00e9, \u00e0 l'exception des bracelets MedicAlert. Elles ne pr\u00e9voyaient pas d'exception pour les bijoux religieux. Ceci obligeait les cadets soit \u00e0 enlever leurs bijoux religieux, soit \u00e0 aller parler \u00e0 l'instructeur pour demander une exemption, comme l'a fait M. Tahmourpour.\n[18] Compte tenu de cette preuve, j'estime que M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9tabli prima facie que les instructions relatives au code vestimentaire et aux r\u00e8gles d'hygi\u00e8ne de la GRC ainsi que le commentaire formul\u00e9 par le sergent H\u00e9bert devant la Troupe 4 constituaient une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur la religion de M. Tahmourpour.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[19] Le sergent (aujourd'hui surintendant) Paul H\u00e9bert a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au nom de la GRC. Il a reconnu avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Troupe 4 qu'aucun bijou ne pouvait \u00eatre port\u00e9 durant le conditionnement physique, \u00e0 l'exception de M. Tahmourpour, qui aurait le droit de porter son pendentif \u00e0 caract\u00e8re religieux.\n[20] Le sergent H\u00e9bert a expliqu\u00e9 avoir fait cette annonce \u00e0 tous les cadets parce qu'il ne voulait pas que ces derniers causent des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour parce qu'il ne suivait pas la r\u00e8gle. Normalement, si un cadet n'enl\u00e8ve pas un bijou pour le conditionnement physique, la troupe est oblig\u00e9e de faire des tractions pour se rappeler la r\u00e8gle. Pour \u00e9viter d'avoir \u00e0 faire des tractions, les cadets se rappellent les uns les autres d'enlever leurs bijoux. Le sergent H\u00e9bert a cru qu'il devait annoncer \u00e0 la Troupe 4 que M. Tahmourpour avait le droit de porter son bijou \u00e0 caract\u00e8re religieux pour \u00e9viter que les cadets lui rappellent de le retirer avant le conditionnement physique.\n[21] Le sergent H\u00e9bert a soutenu que M. Tahmourpour ne lui avait pas dit qu'il voulait garder l'information confidentielle. S'il l'avait su, il ne l'aurait pas annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 toute la troupe. Il ne l'aurait dit qu'au guide de droite. Le guide de droite veille \u00e0 ce que tous les membres de la troupe arrivent \u00e0 l'heure au cours et soient habill\u00e9s correctement. Il serait n\u00e9cessaire d'avertir le guide de droite qu'une exception a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle relative \u00e0 l'uniforme pour qu'il ne cause pas de difficult\u00e9s au cadet dont l'uniforme n'est pas conforme.\n[22] L'affirmation du sergent H\u00e9bert par laquelle il reconna\u00eet qu'il n'aurait pas parl\u00e9 du pendentif devant toute la troupe si M. Tahmourpour le lui avait demand\u00e9 affaiblit son explication voulant qu'il f\u00fbt n\u00e9cessaire de donner ce renseignement \u00e0 tous.\n[23] Le sergent H\u00e9bert a \u00e9galement reconnu qu'il aurait mieux valu informer publiquement les cadets de la r\u00e8gle et des exceptions pour les bijoux \u00e0 caract\u00e8re religieux et les bracelets MedicAlert, sans mentionner de noms. Par la suite, s'il y avait des probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s par le port de bijoux dans le cours de conditionnement physique, l'instructeur aurait pu aborder individuellement et discr\u00e8tement le(s) cadet(s) concern\u00e9(s) pour discuter de la situation.\n[24] Le sergent H\u00e9bert a soutenu qu'il aurait fait l'annonce d'une voix forte parce qu'il se trouvait dans un milieu bruyant. Cependant, il ne l'aurait pas fait sur un ton sarcastique parce qu'il respecte les croyances et les valeurs des gens.\n[25] J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage du sergent H\u00e9bert selon lequel l'annonce a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite publiquement \u00e0 la Troupe 4, mais sur un ton neutre. Toutefois, cela ne change rien au fait que M. Tahmourpour s'est senti vis\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant diff\u00e9rent du reste de la troupe en raison de sa religion. Bien que de nombreux de ses camarades de troupe aient t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour la GRC et affirm\u00e9 ne pas savoir qu'il \u00e9tait de religion musulmane, cela ne signifie pas que M. Tahmourpour n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 sur sa religion par d'autres cadets qui n'ont pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9.\n[26] Une des difficult\u00e9s \u00e9prouv\u00e9es par M. Tahmourpour en l'esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des t\u00e9moignages de ses anciens camarades de troupe qui sont aujourd'hui des agents de la GRC. M. Tahmourpour soutient qu'il a eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver des personnes qui accepteraient de t\u00e9moigner contre la GRC en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[27] En outre, l'impression qu'a ressentie M. Tahmourpour d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant diff\u00e9rent me suffit pour conclure que, bien que non intentionnel, l'effet de la politique de la GRC relativement au code vestimentaire et aux r\u00e8gles d'hygi\u00e8ne ainsi que la mention faite par le sergent H\u00e9bert du pendentif religieux de M. Tahmourpour constituaient un acte discriminatoire contre M. Tahmourpour fond\u00e9 sur sa religion. Cette all\u00e9gation est par cons\u00e9quent fond\u00e9e selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n(b) Les remarques et le traitement discriminatoires du caporal Dan Boyer\n[28] L'instructeur en chef de la formation au tir \u00e9tait le caporal Dan Boyer. Le caporal Boyer (aujourd'hui \u00e0 la retraite) \u00e9tait connu pour sa pr\u00e9sence forte et autoritaire sur le champ de tir. De nombreux cadets avaient peur de commettre des erreurs sur le champ de tir parce que le caporal Boyer se montrait s\u00e9v\u00e8re et brusque dans ses r\u00e9primandes.\n[29] M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le caporal Boyer se montrait constamment hostile et violent verbalement envers lui. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le caporal Boyer se tenait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s de lui au champ de tir et lui criait \u00e0 l'oreille qu'il \u00e9tait un [traduction] perdant, un [traduction] l\u00e2che, [traduction] foutrement inutile et [traduction] incomp\u00e9tent. M. Tahmourpour a convenu que le caporal Boyer criait et se montrait violent verbalement envers les autres cadets de la Troupe 4. Cependant, il a soutenu que le caporal Boyer a dirig\u00e9 beaucoup plus de son attention n\u00e9gative vers lui que vers les autres cadets. Ce comportement a eu un effet tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gatif sur la capacit\u00e9 de M. Tahmourpour d'obtenir de bons r\u00e9sultats au tir.\n[30] M. Tahmourpour a soutenu que le caporal Boyer a clairement fait savoir qu'il savait que son comportement \u00e9tait offensant. Il a affirm\u00e9 devant la Troupe 4 qu'il \u00e9tait [traduction] politiquement incorrect et que peu lui importait qui le savait ou qui s'y opposait.\n[31] Le Dr Scot Wortley, un criminologue de l'Universit\u00e9 de Toronto, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au nom de M. Tahmourpour. Il a la qualit\u00e9 d'expert en racisme dans les services de police. Le Dr Wortley a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l'expression [traduction] politiquement incorrect est p\u00e9jorative et sarcastique. Elle vise \u00e0 communiquer une attitude de m\u00e9pris envers les droits de la personne. Le Dr Wortley a soutenu que, lorsqu'une personne en position d'autorit\u00e9 affirme qu'elle est politiquement incorrecte, elle peut vouloir communiquer l'id\u00e9e que le syst\u00e8me ne prend pas au s\u00e9rieux les plaintes de discrimination et que les attitudes discriminatoires sont tol\u00e9r\u00e9es.\n[32] M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'une fois, assez t\u00f4t dans le programme de formation, le caporal Boyer l'a regard\u00e9 signer un formulaire d'\u00e9valuation et a ensuite dit : [traduction] Quelle sorte de putain de langue est-ce que c'est, ou est-ce que c'est quelque chose que tu as invent\u00e9 ? M. Tahmourpour signe son nom de droite \u00e0 gauche en alphabet persan, comme on le lui a appris quand il \u00e9tait enfant en Iran. Il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 signer son nom de cette fa\u00e7on. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 profond\u00e9ment bless\u00e9 quand le caporal Boyer a prof\u00e9r\u00e9 ces remarques offensantes \u00e0 propos de sa signature.\n[33] M. Tahmourpour a soutenu avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de se concentrer et d'obtenir des r\u00e9sultats \u00e0 la mesure de ses capacit\u00e9s en formation au tir parce qu'il craignait constamment de se faire r\u00e9primander par le caporal Boyer ou d'encourir sa r\u00e9probation.\n[34] Son mauvais rendement en formation au tir, qui a finalement men\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat de formation, \u00e9tait du \u00e0 l'antipathie manifest\u00e9e par le caporal Boyer et au traitement pr\u00e9judiciable qu'il lui a r\u00e9serv\u00e9.\n[35] Le sergent Brar a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour M. Tahmourpour. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 instructeur et moniteur de troupe au D\u00e9p\u00f4t de 1998 \u00e0 2000. Le sergent Brar appartient \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible; ses anc\u00eatres sont originaires de l'Asie orientale. Il a remarqu\u00e9, alors qu'il se trouvait sur le champ de tir avec ses troupes, que le caporal Boyer accordait beaucoup d'attention n\u00e9gative aux cadets appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles ainsi qu'aux femmes (sauf s'il semblait les trouver de son go\u00fbt, dans lequel cas il les traitait favorablement). Il a soutenu que le caporal Boyer criait plus et se montrait plus brutal dans ses relations avec les cadets appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles et les femmes. Le caporal Boyer \u00e9tait plus jovial avec les hommes caucasiens et avec les jolies femmes.\n[36] Le sergent Brar a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir constat\u00e9 l'effet du comportement du caporal Boyer sur le rendement des cadets. Il a observ\u00e9 que, lorsque le caporal Boyer leur criait \u00e0 l'oreille et les r\u00e9primandait, les cadets n'obtenaient pas de bons r\u00e9sultats.\n[37] Le sergent Brar a parl\u00e9 du comportement discriminatoire du caporal Boyer envers les minorit\u00e9s visibles et les femmes \u00e0 l'officier responsable du D\u00e9p\u00f4t, l'inspecteur Keith Clark. Le sergent Brar ne se souvenait pas de la date exacte \u00e0 laquelle il a fait rapport du comportement du caporal Boyer \u00e0 l'inspecteur Clark. Il a dit \u00e0 l'inspecteur Clark qu'il croyait que le comportement du caporal Boyer serait \u00e0 l'origine de plaintes de harc\u00e8lement et de discrimination raciale. Le sergent Brar a soutenu que l'inspecteur Clark n'a pas demand\u00e9 d'autres renseignements.\n[38] Le sergent Brar a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le caporal Boyer et lui n'\u00e9taient pas en bons termes pendant qu'il travaillait au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Il a soutenu qu'il avait l'impression, fond\u00e9e sur ce qu'il avait observ\u00e9 du comportement du caporal Boyer, que ce dernier ne l'aimait pas en raison de sa race et de son origine ethnique.\n[39] Le sergent Brar a parl\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage d'un incident survenu entre le caporal Boyer et lui-m\u00eame au cours duquel le caporal Boyer a reproch\u00e9 au sergent Brar une d\u00e9cision qu'il avait prise \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un des cadets de sa troupe. Le sergent Brar a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le ton de voix du caporal Boyer et le langage offensant qu'il avait employ\u00e9s au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e9taient inappropri\u00e9s \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il parlait \u00e0 un coll\u00e8gue du m\u00eame rang. Le sergent Brar a raccroch\u00e9 au nez du caporal Boyer plut\u00f4t que de le laisser continuer \u00e0 lui faire des reproches.\n[40] Compte tenu de la preuve ci-dessus, M. Tahmourpour a prouv\u00e9 prima facie que le caporal Dan Boyer a formul\u00e9 des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes \u00e0 propos de la signature de M. Tahmourpour qui \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur l'origine nationale ou ethnique de M. Tahmourpour et que le caporal Boyer s'est montr\u00e9 violent verbalement envers M. Tahmourpour. Cette preuve, en plus de celle montrant que le caporal Boyer se ventait d'\u00eatre [traduction] politiquement incorrect, ainsi que le t\u00e9moignage du sergent Brar selon lequel le caporal se montrait plus dur envers les cadets et les instructeurs appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles qu'envers leurs homologues caucasiens constituent une preuve indirecte suffisante pour \u00e9tablir prima facie que le comportement hostile et violent du caporal Boyer envers M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait fond\u00e9, du moins en partie, sur la race, la religion et l'origine nationale ou ethnique de M. Tahmourpour.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[41] Le caporal Boyer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour la GRC. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 instructeur de la formation au tir au D\u00e9p\u00f4t de juillet 1996 \u00e0 2001. Il a reconnu avoir formul\u00e9 des remarques au sujet de la signature de M. Tahmourpour. Cependant, il a soutenu ne pas avoir prof\u00e9r\u00e9 de juron devant lui. Le caporal Boyer a regard\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour signer un des formulaires d'\u00e9valuation. Il a remarqu\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour signait son nom de la droite vers la gauche puis ajoutait des [traduction] gribouillis \u00e0 la fin. La signature avait l'air d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite dans une autre langue. Le caporal Boyer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 n'avoir pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour dans quelle langue \u00e9tait sa signature, ni s'il s'agissait de quelque chose qu'il avait invent\u00e9. Le caporal Boyer a affirm\u00e9 avoir pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour sur sa signature par curiosit\u00e9; il portait un int\u00e9r\u00eat sinc\u00e8re aux langues diff\u00e9rentes. \u00c9galement, il a affirm\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour signait un document juridique et qu'il voulait s'assurer qu'il s'agissait bel et bien de sa signature.\n[42] Le caporal Boyer a admis qu'il jurait au travail. Il a reconnu qu'il s'\u00e9tait fait dire par les cadets qu'il criait et qu'il parlait fort. Il a reconnu qu'il y avait eu d'autres plaintes \u00e0 son endroit, mais il ne pouvait se rappeler les d\u00e9tails d'aucune des plaintes. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait possible qu'il ait re\u00e7u un avertissement concernant les remarques condescendantes et inappropri\u00e9es qu'il adressait aux cadets. Le caporal Boyer a convenu qu'un de ses examens de rendement signalait qu'il tenait [traduction] des propos grossiers, mais il a affirm\u00e9 avoir fait des efforts pour r\u00e9gler ce probl\u00e8me. Pourtant, il a reconnu qu'il jurait encore en pr\u00e9sence de sa famille et, donc, que ses efforts n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement couronn\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s. Le caporal Boyer a \u00e9galement admis que, avant qu'il ne prenne sa retraite, des plaintes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es parce qu'il lan\u00e7ait des jurons \u00e0 la t\u00eate des cadets.\n[43] Compte tenu de cette preuve, j'estime que, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, le caporal Boyer a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour : [traduction] Quelle sorte de putain de langue est-ce que c'est, ou est-ce que c'est quelque chose que tu as invent\u00e9 ?. L'affirmation du caporal Boyer selon laquelle il \u00e9prouvait une curiosit\u00e9 sinc\u00e8re au sujet de la langue et de la culture des autres ne sonnait pas juste. Elle semblait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e et manquait d'authenticit\u00e9. En outre, elle contredisait d'autres t\u00e9moignages que j'ai entendus \u00e0 propos de la tendance qu'avait le caporal Boyer de rabaisser les cadets des minorit\u00e9s visibles.\n[44] Son explication concernant l'authenticit\u00e9 de la signature de M. Tahmourpour n'avait aucun sens et semblait \u00e9galement fabriqu\u00e9e. La mani\u00e8re dont M. Tahmourpour signe le formulaire d'\u00e9valuation est absolument sans cons\u00e9quence sur l'authenticit\u00e9 ou la validit\u00e9 du contenu du document. La signature ne fait que prouver que le cadet a re\u00e7u le document. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n'accepte pas les explications du caporal Boyer relativement \u00e0 ses remarques au sujet la signature de M. Tahmourpour.\n[45] Le caporal Boyer a ni\u00e9 s'\u00eatre montr\u00e9 plus dur envers M. Tahmourpour qu'envers les autres cadets de la Troupe 4. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, comme un certain nombre d'instructeurs de formation au tir, il parlait d'une voix forte et agressive. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas une brute, bien qu'il f\u00fbt conscient qu'il pouvait [traduction] possiblement intimider certaines personnes. Le caporal Boyer a affirm\u00e9 avoir adopt\u00e9 ce style parce que la formation au tir se fait dans un milieu tr\u00e8s dangereux et qu'il est important de veiller \u00e0 ce que l'ordre et le d\u00e9corum soient maintenus en tout temps sur le champ de tir.\n[46] Le caporal Boyer a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas [traduction] politiquement correct en tout temps. Il croyait que l'expression politiquement correct signifiait ne jamais jurer ni crier. Il consid\u00e9rait le D\u00e9p\u00f4t comme un monde politiquement correct o\u00f9 il est interdit de jurer et o\u00f9 il faut tenter de demeurer aussi poli que possible. Le caporal Boyer a affirm\u00e9 jurer et crier et que, en ce sens, il n'est pas politiquement correct. Cependant, il ne se consid\u00e9rait pas comme raciste.\n[47] Le caporal Boyer a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 sur sa r\u00e9action \u00e0 la directive de son superviseur lui enjoignant d'enlever les [traduction] magazines pour hommes qu'il avait laiss\u00e9s dans la salle de bain des hommes. (Je d\u00e9duis que l'expression magazines pour hommes d\u00e9signe des revues comportant des photographies sexuellement explicites de femmes, ce que de nombreuses personnes consid\u00e8rent comme une atteinte \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des sexes.) Le caporal Boyer a affirm\u00e9 que sa premi\u00e8re r\u00e9action \u00e0 la directive d'enlever les magazines a \u00e9t\u00e9 de supposer que le D\u00e9p\u00f4t essayait d'\u00eatre politiquement correct. Le caporal Boyer a affirm\u00e9 qu'il voulait dire par l\u00e0 que le D\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9tait [traduction] un milieu de travail juste et que certains articles auraient pu offenser certaines personnes.\n[48] Le t\u00e9moignage du caporal Boyer n'\u00e9tait ni coh\u00e9rent ni convaincant. Il est fort probable qu'il savait que l'expression politiquement correct signifiait plus que ne pas jurer, sinon il n'aurait pas r\u00e9pondu que le D\u00e9p\u00f4t essayait d'\u00eatre politiquement correct quand on lui a ordonn\u00e9 d'enlever ses [traduction] magazines pour hommes de la salle de bain. Je crois qu'il savait, mais n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 l'admettre \u00e0 la barre, que l'expression politiquement correct signifiait respecter les droits des femmes et des minorit\u00e9s visibles, entre autres choses. J'estime que, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, le caporal Boyer a dit aux gens qu'il \u00e9tait politiquement incorrect, et par cette expression il voulait dire qu'il dirait ce qu'il voudrait des gens m\u00eame si ses propos \u00e9taient sexistes ou racistes. \u00c0 mon avis, c'est ce qu'un auditeur raisonnable aurait pens\u00e9 en entendant le caporal Boyer se d\u00e9clarer politiquement incorrect.\n[49] L'agent Brendon McCarney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour la GRC. Il appartient \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible et \u00e9tait membre de la Troupe 4 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle M. Tahmourpour en faisait partie. L'agent McCarney a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'aimait vraiment pas le caporal Boyer. Celui-ci recherchait la confrontation; il criait directement au visage des cadets, en se tenant tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s d'eux.\n[50] L'agent McCarney a re\u00e7u les foudres du caporal Boyer. Il \u00e9tait estomaqu\u00e9. Il s'est assur\u00e9 de ne pas commettre \u00e0 nouveau l'erreur qui a d\u00e9clench\u00e9 la r\u00e9action. Cependant, il ne s'est pas senti cibl\u00e9. Il a affirm\u00e9 que quiconque commettait une erreur se faisait crier apr\u00e8s par le caporal Boyer, y compris les cadets caucasiens.\n[51] Toutefois, l'agent McCarney a affirm\u00e9 qu'il consid\u00e9rait le caporal Boyer comme \u00e9tant politiquement incorrect. Il voulait dire qu'il le consid\u00e9rait comme une personne impolie qui utilise un langage inconvenant pour parler de la race, de l'orientation sexuelle ou de la couleur d'une personne. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un individu qui est politiquement incorrect relativement \u00e0 la race peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 un raciste. En ce sens, l'agent McCarney pensait que le caporal Boyer pouvait \u00eatre raciste, bien qu'il n'ait pas utilis\u00e9 d'expressions racistes \u00e0 son endroit. Le caporal Boyer n'\u00e9tait que m\u00e9chant avec lui.\n[52] J'estime que le t\u00e9moignage de l'agent McCarney corrobore l'affirmation de M. Tahmourpour selon laquelle le caporal Boyer, bien qu'il se montr\u00e2t dur envers tous les cadets, traitait les cadets appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible avec une dose suppl\u00e9mentaire de perniciosit\u00e9. Le t\u00e9moignage du caporal Eldon Draudy vient ajouter \u00e0 la preuve soutenant cette conclusion. Le caporal Draudy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour la GRC. Il est un homme caucasien. Le caporal Draudy a affirm\u00e9 qu'il trouvait le caporal Boyer tr\u00e8s intimidant. Il avait peur de faire des erreurs parce que le caporal Boyer criait tr\u00e8s fort si une erreur \u00e9tait commise. Le caporal Draudy a bien commis une erreur. Le caporal Boyer a cri\u00e9 apr\u00e8s lui pour ne [traduction] pas avoir [eu] la t\u00eate au jeu et pour ne pas s'\u00eatre concentr\u00e9. Le caporal Boyer lui a dit qu'il risquait de mettre sa vie ou celle de quelqu'un d'autre en danger.\n[53] Le caporal Draudy n'a pas d\u00e9crit le caporal Boyer comme \u00e9tant [traduction] m\u00e9chant ou [traduction] violent, comme l'ont fait le sergent Brar, l'agent McCarney et M. Tahmourpour (qui appartiennent tous \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible). Au contraire, le caporal Draudy a affirm\u00e9 qu'il aimait la m\u00e9thode du caporal Boyer parce que le champ de tir est un endroit dangereux et que le caporal Boyer devait en assurer la surveillance tr\u00e8s \u00e9troite pour que personne ne se blesse. La fa\u00e7on dont le caporal Boyer a corrig\u00e9 le caporal Draudy \u00e9tait bien diff\u00e9rente de la fa\u00e7on dont les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles et les cadets qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9s. Le caporal Draudy s'est fait dire qu'il n'avait pas la t\u00eate au jeu, une remarque consid\u00e9rablement plus facile \u00e0 accepter que de se faire dire, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas pour M. Tahmourpour, qu'il \u00e9tait [traduction] foutrement inutile.\n[54] Compte tenu de cette preuve, j'estime que, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, le caporal Boyer a trait\u00e9 les cadets appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et plus d\u00e9favorable que les candidats n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible. J'estime \u00e9galement que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, le caporal Boyer s'est montr\u00e9 violent verbalement et hostile envers M. Tahmourpour, au moins en partie en raison de sa race, de sa religion et de son origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[55] Le caporal Boyer a ni\u00e9 \u00eatre raciste; il a de nombreux amis et membres de sa famille qui appartiennent \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles. Cependant, en examinant la valeur \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 une telle d\u00e9claration, je dois tenir compte du fait qu'il est fort possible que l'attitude du caporal Boyer envers les cadets et les officiers de la GRC appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible diff\u00e8re consid\u00e9rablement de son attitude envers ses amis et sa famille.\n[56] Un sondage men\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s des membres r\u00e9guliers de la GRC en 1996 montrait que 51 p. 100 des membres caucasiens de sexe masculin \u00e9prouvaient du ressentiment envers leurs coll\u00e8gues de minorit\u00e9s visibles, de sexe f\u00e9minin et autochtones, parce qu'ils avaient l'impression que les initiatives d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi conf\u00e9raient \u00e0 ces agents de la GRC un avantage indu. Rien ne prouve que cette attitude a chang\u00e9 de 1996 \u00e0 1999, ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 M. Tahmourpour a suivi la formation au D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n[57] Le caporal Boyer \u00e9tait, comme tous les instructeurs et moniteurs du D\u00e9p\u00f4t, un membre r\u00e9gulier de la GRC. \u00c0 mon sens, il est raisonnable de d\u00e9duire, \u00e0 partir du sondage men\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s des membres r\u00e9guliers et de la preuve produite au sujet du comportement du caporal Boyer au D\u00e9p\u00f4t, que son comportement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Tahmourpour peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9, du moins en partie, sur le ressentiment qu'il \u00e9prouvait, comme de nombreux autres membres r\u00e9guliers caucasiens de sexe masculin, envers les membres de minorit\u00e9s visibles et les femmes de la GRC.\n[58] En conclusion, je conclus que le caporal Boyer a formul\u00e9 des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes au sujet de la signature de M. Tahmourpour, lesquelles \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite. Il a \u00e9galement trait\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et d\u00e9favorable sur la base d'un motif illicite en se montrant particuli\u00e8rement violent verbalement et hostile \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Tahmourpour au D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nB. L'\u00e9valuation du rendement de M. Tahmourpour au D\u00e9p\u00f4t (a) La premi\u00e8re \u00e9valuation\n[59] Le 10 septembre 1999, M. Tahmourpour a re\u00e7u une Feuille d'\u00e9valuation de la performance du cadet dat\u00e9e du 8 septembre 1999 qui comptait 12 AR en Sciences polici\u00e8res appliqu\u00e9es (SPA). AR signifie am\u00e9lioration requise. Un AR est attribu\u00e9 quant le rendement d'un cadet est insatisfaisant, ne serait-ce qu'un peu. Les cadets sont avis\u00e9s par \u00e9crit lorsqu'ils re\u00e7oivent un AR. Si un cadet re\u00e7oit deux AR dans la m\u00eame comp\u00e9tence, il obtient alors un I, soit la cote inacceptable.\n[60] Les critiques dans le document d'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre 1999 portaient principalement sur les pr\u00e9tendues faiblesses de M. Tahmourpour dans ses aptitudes \u00e0 communiquer, \u00e0 participer au groupe, \u00e0 s'auto-\u00e9valuer, \u00e0 g\u00e9rer la pression et \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions. Un certain nombre d'exemples ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis, lesquels d\u00e9montreraient ses faiblesses dans ces domaines. M. Tahmourpour s'est vu donner un mois pour am\u00e9liorer son rendement. Une rencontre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e pour discuter de ses progr\u00e8s.\n[61] M. Tahmourpour a soutenu que presque tous les points de l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre 1999 \u00e9taient faux. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son rendement \u00e0 ce moment n'\u00e9tait pas moins satisfaisant que celui de n'importe quel autre cadet et que les \u00e9valuations n\u00e9gatives constituaient une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur sa race, sa religion et son origine nationale ou ethnique. \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, si son rendement \u00e9tait faible dans les domaines \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9valuation, c'\u00e9tait en raison du traitement discriminatoire dont il faisait l'objet. Contrairement \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues cadets, il n'a pu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'un milieu non discriminatoire pour se d\u00e9velopper et d\u00e9montrer ses capacit\u00e9s.\n[62] Je me pencherai sur deux des exemples pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre 1999 : les faibles aptitudes \u00e0 communiquer de M. Tahmourpour et l'incident de la vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9, ce dernier \u00e9tant cens\u00e9 d\u00e9montrer les faiblesses de M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 g\u00e9rer la pression et \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions. Ces deux exemples illustrent bien les questions soulev\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n(i) Les aptitudes \u00e0 communiquer de M. Tahmourpour\n[63] Les moniteurs de M. Tahmourpour ont signal\u00e9 qu'il avait beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00e9couter et \u00e0 communiquer efficacement. Cette faiblesse s'est manifest\u00e9e durant la simulation de ma\u00eetrise de la col\u00e8re le 18 ao\u00fbt 1999. \u00c0 ce moment, M. Tahmourpour n'a pas \u00e9cout\u00e9 les clients qui offraient un plan d'action acceptable. M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 que, bien qu'il n'ait pas r\u00e9ussi remarquablement bien lors de cette s\u00e9ance, son rendement n'avait certainement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pire que celui d'autres cadets de sa troupe.\n[64] Un autre exemple illustrait les faibles aptitudes \u00e0 \u00e9couter et \u00e0 communiquer de M. Tahmourpour dans l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre, soit le sc\u00e9nario du [traduction] groupe consultatif communautaire. Les sc\u00e9narios sont des jeux de r\u00f4le portant sur des situations qui se produisent dans le cadre du travail d'un policier. Les cadets doivent y appliquer les connaissances et les aptitudes qu'ils ont acquises durant leur formation pour r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me dans le sc\u00e9nario.\n[65] M. Tahmourpour s'est port\u00e9 volontaire pour jouer le r\u00f4le d'un policier dont la t\u00e2che \u00e9tait de servir de mod\u00e9rateur dans une r\u00e9union communautaire au sujet d'une question pr\u00e9occupant les r\u00e9sidants du quartier. Le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques ont fait observer que [traduction] les membres d'une collectivit\u00e9 fictive ont soulev\u00e9 divers probl\u00e8mes et ce qui a commenc\u00e9 comme une r\u00e9union constructive s'est termin\u00e9 en situation destructive o\u00f9 les membres de la collectivit\u00e9 \u00e9taient visiblement m\u00e9contents du policier. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 que cette situation s'\u00e9tait produite parce que M. Tahmourpour n'avait pas fait montre de bonnes aptitudes \u00e0 communiquer et \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un consensus afin de d\u00e9finir le probl\u00e8me et de parvenir \u00e0 une solution. Il n'a pas su \u00e9couter les membres de la collectivit\u00e9 et semblait avoir son propre programme.\n[66] Au contraire, M. Tahmourpour a soutenu que la r\u00e9union communautaire s'\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9e. Il a affirm\u00e9 que les r\u00e9sidants de la collectivit\u00e9 voulaient que les r\u00e8glements changent pour permettre \u00e0 leurs invit\u00e9s de ne pas recevoir de contravention pour stationnement ill\u00e9gal quand ils \u00e9taient en visite. Il leur a r\u00e9pondu que la loi \u00e9tait la loi, mais qu'il essaierait de voir ce qui pouvait \u00eatre fait en passant par les voies appropri\u00e9es. M. Tahmourpour a estim\u00e9 que tous les participants \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t satisfaits du r\u00e9sultat. Ses camarades de troupe lui avaient donn\u00e9 de la r\u00e9troaction positive sur sa fa\u00e7on de g\u00e9rer la situation.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[67] Le caporal Bradley (aujourd'hui inspecteur) a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, elle a senti que M. Tahmourpour \u00e9prouvait beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s dans les formations de type sc\u00e9nario. Il peinait \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter la situation et \u00e0 r\u00e9agir en cons\u00e9quence. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ses difficult\u00e9s d\u00e9coulaient de ses faibles aptitudes en communication. Les aptitudes en communication ne se limitent pas au discours. Elles comprennent l'\u00e9coute, la prise de renseignements et la r\u00e9action appropri\u00e9e. En raison de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer efficacement, M. Tahmourpour avait des faiblesses dans tous les aspects de l'\u00e9valuation du risque, de l'\u00e9valuation de la force polici\u00e8re et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et dans l'interaction avec les suspects.\n[68] Le caporal Bradley a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour a re\u00e7u r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de la r\u00e9troaction verbale au sujet de ses aptitudes \u00e0 communiquer. Par exemple, lors du sc\u00e9nario sur la ma\u00eetrise de la col\u00e8re, M. Tahmourpour avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de r\u00e9pondre aux signaux et d'utiliser les techniques qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 montr\u00e9es. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure normale, son rendement a \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le sc\u00e9nario. Le caporal Jacques et le caporal Bradley ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la r\u00e9troaction aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re constructive.\n[69] Pour ce qui est du groupe consultatif communautaire, le caporal Bradley a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour semblait avoir adopt\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode pour r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Peu importe les renseignements ou les \u00e9motions auxquels il devait r\u00e9agir, il ne d\u00e9viait pas de son plan. Il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 qu'il n'a pas \u00e9cout\u00e9 les gens et n'a pas r\u00e9agi \u00e0 ce qu'ils disaient. Les membres du groupe sont devenus de plus en plus f\u00e2ch\u00e9s \u00e0 mesure qu'ils ont senti que M. Tahmourpour ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux questions qu'ils soulevaient. Il n'a pas utilis\u00e9 les techniques qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 montr\u00e9es pour entamer des n\u00e9gociations sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats, comme reformuler, cerner les int\u00e9r\u00eats, poser des questions, interpr\u00e9ter les \u00e9motions et dire des choses comme : [traduction] D'accord, je vois que c'est tr\u00e8s important pour vous, que puis-je faire pour vous aider?\n[70] L'inspecteur Bradley a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage cr\u00e9dible au sujet des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 communiquer de M. Tahmourpour. Elle a fait bonne figure lors du contre-interrogatoire rigoureux \u00e0 ce sujet. Par exemple, lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9e sur le fait que les pairs de M. Tahmourpour avaient jug\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9 en contr\u00f4le tout le long de l'exercice du groupe consultatif communautaire, l'inspecteur Bradley a r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'y avait pas de contradiction entre demeurer en contr\u00f4le du groupe (ce qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement positif) et n\u00e9anmoins ne pas r\u00e9pondre aux besoins et aux int\u00e9r\u00eats dont il \u00e9tait question durant la r\u00e9union. Elle n'est pas revenue sur son opinion selon laquelle le rendement de M. Tahmourpour lors de cette r\u00e9union \u00e9tait inacceptable. Elle a pu r\u00e9pondre aux questions que lui a pos\u00e9es l'avocat du plaignant avec calme et sans d\u00e9tour. Ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e9taient assur\u00e9es et directes et elle a parl\u00e9 avec conviction et avec un air de candeur que j'ai trouv\u00e9 convaincant.\n[71] Au contraire, j'ai trouv\u00e9 la preuve de M. Tahmourpour sur la question de ses aptitudes \u00e0 communiquer moins que cr\u00e9dible. Il affirme que son rendement lors de l'exercice du groupe consultatif communautaire \u00e9tait excellent parce qu'il avait trouv\u00e9 une solution. Il me semble qu'il ne saisit pas enti\u00e8rement que la communication ne se limite pas \u00e0 exprimer ses id\u00e9es et \u00e0 trouver une solution \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me. Par exemple, lorsqu'on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour ce qu'il croyait que voulait dire l'expression [traduction] \u00e9coute active, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il croyait que \u00e7a voulait dire prendre de bonnes notes.\n[72] M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9galement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sa faiblesse \u00e0 s'auto-\u00e9valuer pendant l'audience. Il a convenu en contre-interrogatoire qu'il pouvait avoir certains points faibles en communication. Pourtant, quand on lui a demand\u00e9 quels \u00e9taient ces points faibles, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de les nommer. Il a souvent r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que, comme tout le monde, il avait des choses \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer. Mais quand on lui a demand\u00e9 quelles pourraient \u00eatre ces choses, il a r\u00e9pondu vaguement.\n[73] Par cons\u00e9quent, je crois que, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, en date du 8 septembre 1999, M. Tahmourpour avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il ne parvenait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper certaines aptitudes en communication qui sont essentielles au travail du policier : l'\u00e9coute active, l'\u00e9tablissement d'un consensus, la n\u00e9gociation fond\u00e9e sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats et parler sur un ton qui impose le respect. La premi\u00e8re partie de l'all\u00e9gation de M. Tahmourpour n'est donc pas prouv\u00e9e prima facie.\n[74] Cependant, M. Tahmourpour a soutenu, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, que ses faiblesses r\u00e9sultaient des critiques injustifi\u00e9es qu'il recevait constamment au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. M. Tahmourpour a bel et bien re\u00e7u beaucoup d'attention de la part des instructeurs au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Une partie de cette attention d\u00e9coulait d'efforts sinc\u00e8res visant \u00e0 l'aider \u00e0 surmonter ses faiblesses dans des domaines comme la communication. Cependant, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible de harc\u00e8lement verbal et de remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes de la part du caporal Boyer, dont le comportement \u00e9tait fond\u00e9, du moins en partie, sur la race, la religion ou l'origine ethnique ou culturelle de M. Tahmourpour. Ce dernier a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait senti intimid\u00e9 et que sa confiance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement \u00e9branl\u00e9e par ce traitement.\n[75] M. Tahmourpour a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'impression d'isolement et la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 qu'il ressentait d\u00e9coulaient d'une s\u00e9ance de [traduction] formation de sensibilisation qui avait eu lieu t\u00f4t dans le programme. Il a affirm\u00e9 que le caporal Jacques avait commenc\u00e9 la s\u00e9ance en d\u00e9clarant : [traduction] C'est le cours o\u00f9 on vous enseigne comment \u00eatre politiquement correct pour \u00e9viter que vous ne vous mettiez les pieds dans les plats. Apr\u00e8s cette affirmation, un cadet s'est exclam\u00e9 : [traduction] Allons tous \u00e0 Fort McMurry, eh. Puis un autre cadet a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 : [traduction] Passons d'abord acheter du jus de photocopieur et du Varsol, eh! Les cadets avaient imit\u00e9 l'accent de certains autochtones canadiens en faisant ces d\u00e9clarations. Il semble que ces commentaires aient fait rire de nombreux cadets. Selon M. Tahmourpour, le caporal Jacques n'a pas d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 ces remarques et n'a pas r\u00e9primand\u00e9 les cadets qui les ont formul\u00e9es. M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 s'\u00eatre senti extr\u00eamement mal \u00e0 l'aise et isol\u00e9 de ses camarades de troupe en raison de ces commentaires de toute \u00e9vidence racistes.\n[76] L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas soumis de preuve en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l'incident s'est produit tel que l'a d\u00e9crit M. Tahmourpour et qu'il a eu pour cons\u00e9quence que M. Tahmourpour s'est senti vuln\u00e9rable au racisme au D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n[77] Il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis qu'un traitement raciste et discriminatoire a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur la capacit\u00e9 de la victime de fonctionner efficacement dans son milieu de travail (voir par exemple Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel du Canada, [2001] D.C.D.P. no 29, au paragraphe 119; Naraine c. Ford Motor Co., [1996] O.H.R.B.I.D. no 23, au paragraphe 93, inf. sur un autre point par (2001), 209 D.L.R. (4th) 465 (O.C.A.); Hinds c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'immigration), [1988] D.C.D.P. no 13). Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsque sont analys\u00e9es les all\u00e9gations propres \u00e0 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, le comportement du plaignant doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 dans le contexte du milieu de travail dans son ensemble. Si le milieu de travail (en l'esp\u00e8ce, de formation) \u00e9tait empoisonn\u00e9 par de la discrimination et du harc\u00e8lement, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si le milieu a affect\u00e9 le comportement ou le rendement du plaignant.\n[78] Quand j'examine la conduite de M. Tahmourpour en tenant compte du traitement discriminatoire qu'il a subi au D\u00e9p\u00f4t, j'estime que, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, ce traitement a constitu\u00e9 un facteur ayant caus\u00e9 ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper et d\u00e9montrer des aptitudes acceptables en communication. Dans une ambiance o\u00f9 l'intol\u00e9rance raciale et le harc\u00e8lement sont tacitement approuv\u00e9s et o\u00f9 les cadets comme M. Tahmourpour sont la cible de violence verbale et d'intimidation, il est raisonnable de d\u00e9duire que le rendement de ceux-ci en sera affect\u00e9. Pour cette raison, j'estime que, bien que les critiques des moniteurs relativement aux aptitudes de M. Tahmourpour en communication refl\u00e9taient sans doute fid\u00e8lement ce qu'ils ont observ\u00e9, elles ne refl\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessairement de fa\u00e7on fid\u00e8le les v\u00e9ritables aptitudes de M. Tahmourpour dans ce domaine. M. Tahmourpour n'a pas profit\u00e9 d'un milieu exempt de discrimination dans lequel d\u00e9velopper et d\u00e9montrer ses aptitudes en communication. En cons\u00e9quence, je conclus que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la seconde partie de l'all\u00e9gation de M. Tahmourpour concernant cet aspect de l'\u00e9valuation du 10 septembre 1999 a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e prima facie.\n(ii) L'incident de la vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9\n[79] Le 26 ao\u00fbt 1999, les cadets de la Troupe 4 ont pris part \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance o\u00f9 on leur a vaporis\u00e9 du gaz poivr\u00e9 dans la figure et o\u00f9 ils ont ensuite d\u00fb accomplir une s\u00e9rie de t\u00e2ches. Le but de la s\u00e9ance \u00e9tait de fournir aux cadets une exp\u00e9rience personnelle des effets du gaz poivr\u00e9 et d'\u00e9valuer leur rendement sous pression. Chaque cadet \u00e9tait jumel\u00e9 \u00e0 un partenaire dont le r\u00f4le \u00e9tait d'aider le premier \u00e0 se rincer les yeux et \u00e0 se remettre d'aplomb. Les cadets se sont mis en rang avec leur partenaire. Quand ils \u00e9taient nomm\u00e9s, un cadet s'avan\u00e7ait pour \u00eatre asperg\u00e9 de gaz poivr\u00e9, alors que l'autre restait pr\u00e8s pour pr\u00eater assistance.\n[80] Dans la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation de la performance du cadet dat\u00e9e du 8 septembre 1999, le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques ont \u00e9crit que, juste avant la s\u00e9ance de vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9, M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait tellement nerveux qu'il ne pensait pas pouvoir passer \u00e0 travers. Ils ont \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que, durant le test, son angoisse l'avait compl\u00e8tement coup\u00e9 de son environnement. En cons\u00e9quence, il n'\u00e9tait pas en rang au moment o\u00f9 son partenaire allait \u00eatre asperg\u00e9. D'autres cadets de la Troupe ont d\u00fb aller le chercher pour qu'il puisse prendre soin de son partenaire.\n[81] M. Tahmourpour a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'\u00e9valuation de son rendement lors de la s\u00e9ance de vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9 \u00e9tait inexacte. \u00c0 son avis, il s'en est tr\u00e8s bien sorti. Il ne manquait pas \u00e0 l'appel quand c'\u00e9tait le tour de son partenaire d'\u00eatre asperg\u00e9; il \u00e9tait l\u00e0 pour l'aider, comme il le fallait.\n[82] M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'\u00e9valuation sur la vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9 \u00e9tait une des nombreuses fausses \u00e9valuations incluses dans la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre 1999 dans le but de monter un dossier contre lui \u00e0 l'instigation du caporal Boyer. Selon M. Tahmourpour, le caporal Boyer l'avait pris en grippe et allait faire tout en son pouvoir pour faire r\u00e9silier son contrat de formation.\n[83] Selon M. Tahmourpour, l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre en SPA a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie le 9 ou le 10 septembre, apr\u00e8s l'altercation qu'il a eue avec le caporal Boyer le 9 septembre 1999. Le 9 septembre, le caporal Boyer a attribu\u00e9 un I \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour parce que son pistolet \u00e9tait sale. M. Tahmourpour n'\u00e9tait pas d'accord sur le fait que son pistolet \u00e9tait sale. Il a demand\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me avis. Le caporal Boyer s'est mis en col\u00e8re et a dit : [traduction] Enl\u00e8ve-toi de ma face, merde, ou je te botte le cul! M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils en sont presque venus aux coups, mais parce qu'il a fait marche arri\u00e8re, ils ne se sont pas battus. M. Tahmourpour a soutenu que l'\u00e9valuation en SPA du 8 septembre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] invent\u00e9e de toutes pi\u00e8ces en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 des suggestions du caporal Boyer.\n[84] Pour prouver que l'\u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e en r\u00e9ponse aux pressions du caporal Boyer, M. Tahmourpour souligne le fait que, avant le 8 septembre 1999, il n'avait re\u00e7u d'\u00e9valuation formelle qu'en Tactiques polici\u00e8res d\u00e9fensives et en Formation au tir. Il n'avait re\u00e7u aucune \u00e9valuation formelle en SPA, pour lesquelles le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques \u00e9taient les instructeurs. Puis soudainement, le 8 septembre 1999, il a re\u00e7u 12 AR en SPA. Selon M. Tahmourpour, il a appris pour la premi\u00e8re fois le 8 septembre 1999 que son rendement en SPA \u00e9tait s\u00e9rieusement insatisfaisant. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9voient les Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation des cadets, il ne s'\u00e9tait pas fait dire lors de plusieurs des incidents mentionn\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9valuation que son rendement \u00e9tait insatisfaisant. Ces incidents dataient d'aussi loin que le 18 ao\u00fbt 1999 - soit environ trois semaines avant la remise de l'\u00e9valuation formelle. L'incident du gaz poivr\u00e9 s'\u00e9tait produit presque deux semaines enti\u00e8res avant le 8 septembre 1999, date de l'\u00e9valuation. Si son rendement n'\u00e9tait pas satisfaisant \u00e0 ce moment, on aurait d\u00fb le lui indiquer alors.\n[85] Selon les Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation des cadets, si le cadet ne re\u00e7oit aucune \u00e9valuation formelle, il peut pr\u00e9sumer que son rendement est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme professionnel (soit P). Toutefois, le cadet re\u00e7oit de la r\u00e9troaction imm\u00e9diatement ou d\u00e8s que possible apr\u00e8s les faits, pour qu'il ait le temps de s'am\u00e9liorer. M. Tahmourpour n'a pas re\u00e7u d'\u00e9valuation formelle lors de plusieurs des incidents mentionn\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre 1999, en particulier apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9ance de vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9 du 26 ao\u00fbt 1999. Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9rogation consid\u00e9rable aux proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation normaux. Ajout\u00e9e au moment o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise l'\u00e9valuation, cette fa\u00e7on de faire laisse entendre qu'un facteur autre que les pr\u00e9occupations des instructeurs au sujet du rendement de M. Tahmourpour a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre 1999.\n[86] Le caporal Boyer avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 son antipathie pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Tahmourpour. Le caporal Jacques et le caporal Boyer \u00e9taient en \u00e9troite communication puisqu'ils enseignaient tous deux la formation au tir. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est probable que le caporal Boyer a influenc\u00e9 l'opinion qu'avait le caporal Jacques de M. Tahmourpour.\n[87] Compte tenu de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Tahmourpour, j'estime qu'il a prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des autres cadets dans l'\u00e9valuation de son rendement relativement \u00e0 l'incident de la vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9 et que son statut de cadet appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans son traitement.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n(i) Que s'est-il produit lors de la s\u00e9ance de vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9?\n[88] Le caporal Brendon McCarney a fourni un DVD de certaines des activit\u00e9s et s\u00e9ances de formation de la troupe. Une des activit\u00e9s enregistr\u00e9es sur le DVD \u00e9tait la s\u00e9ance de vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9. Il n'y a qu'une s\u00e9ance de vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9 par troupe au D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n[89] Le caporal McCarney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la troupe avait engag\u00e9 un vid\u00e9ographe pour enregistrer certaines activit\u00e9s afin d'en faire un souvenir de l'exp\u00e9rience des cadets au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. L'enregistrement DVD ne comprend pas toutes les activit\u00e9s et s\u00e9ances qui ont eu lieu au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 le DVD en preuve, en notant qu'il ne repr\u00e9sente pas l'ensemble de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9cu au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Par cons\u00e9quent, les \u00e9v\u00e9nements apparaissant sur le DVD doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s dans le contexte de toute la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience.\n[90] L'enregistrement DVD montrait la Troupe 4 se dirigeant en marchant vers l'endroit o\u00f9 la vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9 devait avoir lieu. Il y avait deux lignes. M. Tahmourpour se trouvait \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du cadet Lasson, qui \u00e9tait son partenaire pour la s\u00e9ance de vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9. L'enregistrement DVD montre que M. Tahmourpour n'\u00e9tait pas absent quand le cadet Lasson a \u00e9t\u00e9 asperg\u00e9 : la vid\u00e9o montre que M. Tahmourpour, \u00e0 ce moment, \u00e9tait l\u00e0 pour aider son partenaire, le cadet Lasson. Cependant, le cadet Meyer n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 au moment o\u00f9 son partenaire, le cadet Lyle, devait se faire asperger la figure. L'enregistrement montre que quelqu'un a demand\u00e9 qu'on attende que le cadet Meyer soit retrouv\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, selon l'enregistrement DVD, il semble que se soit le cadet Meyer qui n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 pour aider son partenaire, et non M. Tahmourpour.\n[91] Comme les autres cadets qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce, le caporal McCarney ne se rappelait pas qu'un cadet \u00e9tait absent quand son partenaire devait \u00eatre asperg\u00e9. Cependant, quand il a regard\u00e9 le DVD \u00e0 nouveau, il a convenu qu'il avait fallu chercher le cadet Meyer quand son partenaire, le cadet Lyle, allait \u00eatre asperg\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement convenu que le DVD montrait que M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait l\u00e0 quand son partenaire, le cadet Lasson, allait \u00eatre asperg\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les cadets n'\u00e9taient asperg\u00e9s de gaz poivr\u00e9 qu'une fois chacun.\n[92] Le caporal Bradley n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente lors de l'incident de la vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9; elle n'a aucun souvenir de ce qui s'est produit sauf ce que lui a racont\u00e9 le caporal Jacques. Le caporal Bradley a convenu que, selon ce qu'elle a pu observer sur l'enregistrement, M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait l\u00e0 pour son partenaire et a r\u00e9ussi aussi bien que les autres cadets l'\u00e9preuve de la vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9. Cependant, elle est toujours convaincue de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 l'information que lui a transmise son coll\u00e8gue moniteur de troupe, le caporal Jacques, selon laquelle, \u00e0 un certain moment, M. Tahmourpour n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 pour son partenaire quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 asperg\u00e9 de gaz poivr\u00e9 et qu'il a fallu partir \u00e0 sa recherche.\n[93] Le caporal Jacques a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me avec la conduite de M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en rang avec les autres cadets avant que commence la s\u00e9ance de vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9. Ses camarades de troupe ont d\u00fb le chercher pour qu'il vienne se mettre en rang avec les autres cadets de la troupe afin qu'il puisse aider son partenaire pendant qu'il se ferait asperger. Le moment o\u00f9 les cadets se sont mis en rang avant le d\u00e9but de la s\u00e9ance de vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas sur le DVD.\n[94] Le caporal a reconnu en contre-interrogatoire que, contrairement \u00e0 sa pratique habituelle, il n'a pas consign\u00e9 l'absence de M. Tahmourpour dans son carnet. Il a \u00e9galement reconnu prendre normalement des notes dans son carnet lorsque se produisent des incidents importants en formation. Il a pris des notes d\u00e9taill\u00e9es au sujet des progr\u00e8s de M. Tahmourpour, mais cet incident ne figure pas dans ses notes.\n[95] Le t\u00e9moignage du caporal Jacques comportait un autre probl\u00e8me. Malgr\u00e9 l'ordonnance d'exclusion des t\u00e9moins en vigueur, le caporal Jacques a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 avant de t\u00e9moigner de ce que montrait l'enregistrement DVD de l'incident de la vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9 et de la difficult\u00e9 qu'avaient eu les t\u00e9moins pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents \u00e0 concilier le contenu de l'enregistrement avec la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation, selon laquelle M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait absent quand son partenaire [traduction] allait \u00eatre asperg\u00e9 de gaz poivr\u00e9. Ces renseignements ont permis au caporal Jacques de pr\u00e9senter son t\u00e9moignage de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9viter cette difficult\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, l'ordonnance d'exclusion des t\u00e9moins a dans les faits \u00e9t\u00e9 contourn\u00e9e. Cela m'incite \u00e0 mettre en question l'authenticit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage du caporal Jacques \u00e0 ce sujet. Je ne suis pas s\u00fbre qu'il se serait [traduction] souvenu du moment o\u00f9 M. Tahmourpour n'\u00e9tait suppos\u00e9ment pas en rang s'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de prendre en compte la preuve qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avant son t\u00e9moignage. En outre, l'incident n'est pas not\u00e9 dans son carnet, alors qu'il s'est beaucoup appuy\u00e9 sur ses notes pour se rafra\u00eechir la m\u00e9moire.\n[96] Finalement, le caporal Jacques a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour ne se trouvait pas en rang quand la troupe se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 l'exercice. Pourtant il est \u00e9crit dans la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation que M. Tahmourpour n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat lorsque son partenaire [traduction] allait \u00eatre asperg\u00e9 de gaz poivr\u00e9. Le libell\u00e9 de la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation laisse entendre que son absence \u00e9tait beaucoup plus imm\u00e9diate. Il donne \u00e0 penser qu'il s'agit d'une conduite ressemblant \u00e0 celle observ\u00e9e chez le cadet Meyer, qui n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 quand son partenaire allait \u00eatre asperg\u00e9.\n[97] Compte tenu de cette preuve, par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que la description faite par M. Tahmourpour de l'incident de la vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9 est la plus probable. Dans les faits, il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent pour son partenaire quand le cadet Lasson allait \u00eatre asperg\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre nerveux, mais pas plus que les autres cadets semblaient l'\u00eatre pour ce qui \u00e9tait de toute \u00e9vidence une \u00e9preuve intens\u00e9ment stressante et d\u00e9plaisante. Je conclus donc que la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation est inexacte.\n(ii) L'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre 1999 a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par le caporal Boyer?\n[98] La date o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre 1999 laisse croire que certaines parties ont pu \u00eatre fabriqu\u00e9es, ou \u00e0 tout le moins pr\u00e9par\u00e9es rapidement et avec des erreurs, le 9 ou le 10 septembre en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'altercation qui s'est produite le 9 septembre 1999 entre le caporal Boyer et M. Tahmourpour. Compte tenu de la preuve que j'ai entendue, je crois que, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e le 8 septembre 1999 sur un ordinateur du D\u00e9p\u00f4t, puis des ajouts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s le 9 ou le 10 septembre 1999.\n[99] Le caporal Boyer a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne se rappelait pas avoir inspect\u00e9 le pistolet de M. Tahmourpour le 9 septembre 1999. Cependant, il a ni\u00e9 avoir menac\u00e9 de frapper M. Tahmourpour ce jour-l\u00e0. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il se serait attir\u00e9 de [traduction] graves ennuis s'il avait fait une chose pareille. Cependant, il a reconnu avoir utilis\u00e9 l'expression [traduction] te botter le cul \u00e0 l'endroit de cadets dans d'autres situations.\n[100] Le caporal Boyer ne pouvait pas non plus se rappeler si M. Tahmourpour avait demand\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me avis sur la propret\u00e9 de son pistolet. Le caporal Boyer a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, si un cadet demandait un deuxi\u00e8me avis, il refuserait calmement et passerait \u00e0 autre chose. Bien qu'il ait admis \u00eatre autoritaire, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne serait pas f\u00e2ch\u00e9 d'entendre un cadet pr\u00e9senter une telle demande. Le t\u00e9moignage du caporal Boyer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard ne concorde pas avec la preuve que j'ai entendue relativement \u00e0 son caract\u00e8re sur le champ de tir, ni avec ce qu'il a lui-m\u00eame dit \u00e0 propos de sa mani\u00e8re d'interagir avec les cadets et de sa tendance \u00e0 jurer. \u00c0 mon avis, le caporal Boyer n'aurait pas pris \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re une remise en question de son autorit\u00e9.\n[101] Je crois que, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, M. Tahmourpour a bel et bien contest\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation du caporal Boyer sur la propret\u00e9 de son arme et a demand\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me avis. J'accepte la version des faits de M. Tahmourpour sur ce qui s'est alors produit. Son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tait celui qui concordait le plus avec le reste de la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[102] M. Tahmourpour a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s l'altercation, le caporal Boyer a inscrit \u00e0 tort deux AR et un I en Formation au tir le 9 septembre 1999 et a ensuite insist\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de son coll\u00e8gue instructeur, le caporal Jacques, pour qu'il \u00e9value lui-aussi d\u00e9favorablement M. Tahmourpour.\n[103] Le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques ont ni\u00e9 que cela se soit produit. Cependant, le caporal Bradley a bien reconnu que les instructeurs discutaient entre eux du rendement des cadets que le caporal Boyer n'\u00e9tait pas du genre \u00e0 garder pour lui ses opinions.\n[104] Le caporal Jacques, qui enseignait les SPA avec le caporal Bradley, \u00e9tait \u00e9galement form\u00e9 au tir et travaillait en \u00e9troite collaboration avec le caporal Boyer. En d'autres termes, le caporal Jacques enseignait tant les SPA que la Formation au tir au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Le caporal Jacques m'est apparu comme quelqu'un pouvant bien \u00eatre influenc\u00e9 par un officier d'exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 la personnalit\u00e9 extr\u00eamement forte comme le caporal Boyer.\n[105] Fait int\u00e9ressant, le 10 septembre 1999, le caporal Jacques a not\u00e9 dans son carnet que M. Tahmourpour ne poss\u00e9dait pas les qualit\u00e9s de base pour \u00eatre policier. Pourtant, jusqu'au mois de septembre, le rendement de M. Tahmourpour au D\u00e9p\u00f4t ne lui avait valu aucun AR, sauf deux en Formation au tir et un en TPD pour avoir mal effectu\u00e9 un menottage. Sans avertissement, le 10 septembre 1999, M. Tahmourpour a re\u00e7u une \u00e9valuation de rendement comportant 12 AR en SPA. En contre-interrogatoire, on a demand\u00e9 au caporal Jacques : [traduction] Si M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 en juillet et ao\u00fbt qu'il ne poss\u00e9dait pas les qualit\u00e9s de base pour \u00eatre policier et qu'il n'\u00e9tait clairement pas \u00e0 la hauteur, pourquoi n'a-t-il pas re\u00e7u le moindre AR en SPA pendant ce temps?\n[106] Le caporal Jacques a r\u00e9pondu que M. Tahmourpour avait re\u00e7u verbalement de la r\u00e9troaction informelle, de mani\u00e8re ponctuelle et imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s les faits, pour l'informer que son rendement \u00e9tait faible dans les domaines en question dans l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre. Il aurait pu s'\u00e9tonner de certains AR, mais pas de tous. Il aurait su de la r\u00e9troaction qu'il recevait fr\u00e9quemment que son rendement laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer.\n[107] Le caporal Bradley a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, au d\u00e9but du programme, il n'y a pas de raison de donner des \u00e9valuations formelles aux cadets pour les nombreuses erreurs qu'ils commettent. Remettre une \u00e9valuation formelle \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de l'entra\u00eenement pourrait provoquer une r\u00e9siliation rapide et injuste du contrat de formation. Par cons\u00e9quent, les cadets sont \u00e9valu\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re verbale et informelle et ont leur donne du temps pour s'am\u00e9liorer avant de leur remettre une \u00e9valuation formelle.\n[108] Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, donner de la r\u00e9troaction verbale \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour pour lui faire savoir que certains aspects \u00e9taient \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer ne lui aurait certainement pas fait penser que son rendement \u00e9tait si insatisfaisant qu'il risquait de recevoir 12 AR en SPA. L'affirmation du caporal Jacques selon laquelle M. Tahmourpour aurait pu s'\u00e9tonner de certains AR laisse entendre que, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9voient les Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation des cadets, M. Tahmourpour n'a pas re\u00e7u de r\u00e9troaction imm\u00e9diate sur tous les aspects de son rendement et que la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre repr\u00e9sentait donc un \u00e9cart par rapport aux pratiques en vigueur au D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n[109] L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas fourni d'explication raisonnable justifiant pourquoi la pratique normale n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie en l'esp\u00e8ce. En outre, elle n'a pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9 l'affirmation de M. Tahmourpour selon laquelle la conduite discriminatoire du caporal Boyer envers lui a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre 1999. Au contraire, la r\u00e9ponse du caporal Jacques \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e au sujet de la Feuille de donn\u00e9es cumul\u00e9es du cadet m'a amen\u00e9e \u00e0 conclure qu'il avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 au moins une partie de la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre apr\u00e8s l'altercation entre le caporal Boyer et M. Tahmourpour au sujet de l'inspection du pistolet. Cette conclusion soutient la th\u00e9orie selon laquelle la discrimination a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre.\n[110] La Feuille de donn\u00e9es cumul\u00e9es du cadet (FDCC) est un document utilis\u00e9 par les moniteurs de troupe pour faire le suivi des Feuilles d'\u00e9valuation donn\u00e9es aux cadets par les diff\u00e9rents instructeurs au D\u00e9p\u00f4t et surtout des dates auxquelles les Feuilles d'\u00e9valuation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remises. Il s'agit d'une feuille d'\u00e9valuation ma\u00eetresse. Les \u00e9valuations des instructeurs sont normalement consign\u00e9es sur la FDCC en ordre chronologique. Cependant, dans le cas de M. Tahmourpour, les 2 AR et le I qu'il a re\u00e7us en Formation au tir le 9 septembre 1999 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits avant les 12 AR qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour le 8 septembre 1999.\n[111] Le caporal Bradley a expliqu\u00e9 que cela se produit parfois quand les instructeurs fournissent leur Feuille de rendement en retard ou quand les moniteurs n'ont pas le temps de mettre \u00e0 jour la FDCC. Cependant, en l'esp\u00e8ce, ce sont les moniteurs qui ont pr\u00e9par\u00e9 la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre et qui auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre en mesure de modifier la FDCC imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s. Par cons\u00e9quent, quand la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue de la Formation au tir le 9 septembre 1999, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite apr\u00e8s la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre remplie par les moniteurs.\n[112] Le caporal Jacques a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 au sujet de cette anomalie. Sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9tait vague. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] La seule chose \u00e0 laquelle je peux penser maintenant est que les trois Feuilles d'\u00e9valuation \u00e9taient dat\u00e9es du 9 septembre, celle de la Formation au tir a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite en premier, pendant que je travaillais sur l'autre, euh... avant que l'autre \u00e9valuation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 remise au cadet, M. Tahmourpour, et c'est pourquoi elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite apr\u00e8s les Feuilles d'\u00e9valuation du 9 septembre. La premi\u00e8re partie de la r\u00e9ponse du caporal Jacques (avant l'h\u00e9sitation) laisse entendre qu'il a travaill\u00e9 sur la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre, laquelle comptait 12 AR, le 9 septembre ou apr\u00e8s, quand les trois Feuilles d'\u00e9valuation (comportant deux AR et un I) du caporal Boyer ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Cela apporte de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie de M. Tahmourpour selon laquelle la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation qu'il a re\u00e7ue du caporal Bradley et du caporal Jacques a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e, au moins en partie, par l'impression d\u00e9favorable qu'avait de lui le caporal Boyer. Je crois que la seconde partie de l'affirmation du caporal Jacques constituait une tentative de pr\u00e9senter sous un jour diff\u00e9rent ce qui s'\u00e9tait produit.\n[113] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, le caporal Jacques a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9 par l'attitude raciste du caporal Boyer envers M. Tahmourpour. Le caporal Jacques a r\u00e9agi \u00e0 cette influence en fournissant une \u00e9valuation inexacte du rendement de M. Tahmourpour lors de la s\u00e9ance de vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9.\n[114] En cons\u00e9quence, je conclus que la discrimination a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre concernant le rendement de M. Tahmourpour en SPA.\n(b) La demande d'examen de dossier pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le caporal Boyer\n[115] Le 30 septembre 1999, le caporal Boyer a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le dossier de M. Tahmourpour soit examin\u00e9. L'examen du dossier est la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du processus menant \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation du contrat d'un cadet.\n[116] Les Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation du cadet pr\u00e9voient que le contrat d'un cadet sera r\u00e9sili\u00e9 s'il re\u00e7oit deux I dans la m\u00eame comp\u00e9tence au cours d'une p\u00e9riode d'\u00e9valuation, sans montrer d'am\u00e9lioration. Un contrat peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre r\u00e9sili\u00e9 si un cadet re\u00e7oit au total deux I dans des comp\u00e9tences diff\u00e9rentes ou dans la m\u00eame comp\u00e9tence.\n[117] Le caporal Boyer a demand\u00e9 l'examen du dossier sur la base de deux I et de cinq AR en Formation au tir. L'\u00e9valuation portait sur un certain nombres d'aspects de la Formation au tir, comme la manipulation du fusil et du pistolet, le chargement correct d'une arme \u00e0 feu, l'atteinte de cibles et finalement la propret\u00e9 du pistolet.\n[118] M. Tahmourpour a contest\u00e9 certaines des cotes, mais pas toutes, qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es en Formation au tir. En particulier, il a soutenu que les deux I qu'il a re\u00e7us pour avoir eu un pistolet sale le 9 septembre 1999 et le 28 septembre 1999 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invent\u00e9s par le caporal Boyer qui voulait monter un dossier pour la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat.\n[119] M. Tahmourpour a re\u00e7u un AR pour avoir eu un pistolet sale le 26 ao\u00fbt 1999. Il a pris cette \u00e9valuation d\u00e9favorable tr\u00e8s \u00e0 cur. Il a fait effacer l'AR en pr\u00e9sentant un pistolet propre en deux occasions subs\u00e9quentes. Il est devenu [traduction] un expert du nettoyage de pistolets. Il nettoyait des pistolets pour toute la troupe et tous les autres ont r\u00e9ussi l'inspection de leurs armes; mais lui a \u00e9chou\u00e9.\n[120] M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, le 9 septembre, quand il a re\u00e7u un I pour avoir eu un pistolet sale, il savait que son arme \u00e9tait en parfaite condition. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a contest\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation du caporal Boyer selon laquelle son arme \u00e9tait sale et lui m\u00e9ritait un I. En outre, il a affirm\u00e9 que si son pistolet avait v\u00e9ritablement \u00e9t\u00e9 sale, il aurait d\u00fb recevoir un AR, et non un I, puisqu'il avait fait effacer l'AR pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant et qu'il repartait donc en neuf.\n[121] M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le 28 septembre 1999, il a encore pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son pistolet pour inspection, cette fois au caporal Jacques. Ce dernier a affirm\u00e9 que l'arme \u00e9tait sale. M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne l'\u00e9tait pas. Apr\u00e8s avoir inspect\u00e9 encore une fois l'arme et avoir tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9loger la salet\u00e9, le caporal Jacques a convenu avec M. Tahmourpour qu'il y avait une d\u00e9coloration en relief dans le chargeur de l'arme. Il s'agissait d'un d\u00e9faut de fabrication, et non d'une salet\u00e9. Il a permis \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour de se rendre sur le champ de tir et d'utiliser le pistolet. Apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9ance de tir, le caporal Boyer s'est approch\u00e9 de M. Tahmourpour et a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que son arme \u00e9tait sale et qu'il aurait \u00e0 signer une feuille d'\u00e9valuation lui attribuant un I. M. Tahmourpour a protest\u00e9, en affirmant que le caporal Boyer n'\u00e9tait m\u00eame pas pr\u00e9sent lors de l'inspection.\n[122] Les deux Feuilles d'\u00e9valuation concernant le pistolet sale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9es et sign\u00e9es par le caporal Jacques. Elles ne pr\u00e9cisent pas qui a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 aux inspections.\n[123] Le caporal Boyer a conclu sa demande d'examen de dossier en affirmant que, selon les Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation du cadet, deux I dans la m\u00eame comp\u00e9tence entra\u00eenent une demande d'examen du dossier dans le but de mettre fin au contrat de formation du cadet.\n[124] M. Tahmourpour a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve cr\u00e9dible que son pistolet \u00e9tait propre lorsqu'il l'a soumis aux inspections du 9 et du 28 septembre, mais le caporal Boyer a jug\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait sale. M. Tahmourpour a par cons\u00e9quent prouv\u00e9 prima facie que le caporal Boyer l'a trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des autres cadets dans l'\u00e9valuation de son rendement en Formation au tir. Compte tenu des remarques discriminatoires et de la violence verbale du caporal Boyer \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Tahmourpour, je conclus que, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, la diff\u00e9rence de traitement dans le cadre de l'\u00e9valuation du rendement de M. Tahmourpour et de la demande d'examen de dossier qui s'en est suivie \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, du moins en partie, sur un motif de distinction illicite.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[125] L'intim\u00e9e a affirm\u00e9 que l'\u00e9valuation du rendement de M. Tahmourpour en Formation au tir \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait juste et exacte; le pistolet de M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait sale le 8 septembre 1999 et le 28 septembre 1999.\n[126] Le caporal Boyer a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il existe une politique non \u00e9crite en Formation au tir voulant qu'un cadet re\u00e7oive automatiquement un I si son pistolet est sale quand il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u un AR relativement \u00e0 la propret\u00e9 du pistolet, m\u00eame si l'AR a \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9 du dossier. Selon le caporal Boyer, il n'existe pas de pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Cependant, le caporal Jacques n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 cette politique; il a simplement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, s'il est jug\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me ou une troisi\u00e8me fois que le pistolet est sale et qu'il est clair qu'aucun effort n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, le cadet recevra une \u00e9valuation formelle. Le sergent Guay (aujourd'hui surintendant en chef), l'officier responsable de la Formation au tir \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'un I est attribu\u00e9 quand une arme est constamment sale.\n[127] Compte tenu de la preuve que j'ai entendue, je ne suis pas convaincue, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l'affirmation du caporal Boyer au sujet de l'attribution automatique d'un I pour un deuxi\u00e8me pistolet sale est exacte. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les cons\u00e9quences s\u00e9rieuses que peuvent avoir un I, je crois que, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, s'il existait une politique du I automatique pour la propret\u00e9 de l'arme, elle serait \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans les Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation du cadet. Sans aucun doute, les cadets et les instructeurs auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s de cette politique. Pourtant, aucun des autres t\u00e9moins en l'esp\u00e8ce n'a parl\u00e9 de l'existence d'une telle politique. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que l'instructeur en Formation au tir a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'attribuer un AR ou un I pour un deuxi\u00e8me pistolet sale.\n[128] La preuve de l'intim\u00e9e concernant l'inspection du pistolet le 9 septembre 1999 \u00e9tait faible : le caporal Boyer ne pouvait se souvenir de cette inspection et le caporal Jacques n'a parl\u00e9 d'aucune des deux inspections dans son t\u00e9moignage. La note dans la demande d'examen de dossier pr\u00e9cise que, le 9 septembre, le pistolet \u00e9tait [traduction] crasseux.\n[129] Au contraire, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tahmourpour au sujet de l'inspection de son pistolet le 9 septembre 1999 \u00e9tait clair et n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9branl\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire. Il savait que son pistolet \u00e9tait propre. Il \u00e9tait devenu [traduction] expert dans le nettoyage de pistolets. Cependant, pour \u00eatre s\u00fbr qu'il \u00e9tait propre, M. Tahmourpour avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un camarade de troupe de le v\u00e9rifier avant l'inspection du 9 septembre. Bien qu'aucun de ses coll\u00e8gues de troupe qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ne se rappelait avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 son pistolet, le caporal Draudy a affirm\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait une pratique commune. Il a \u00e9galement dit qu'il \u00e9tait probable que M. Tahmourpour ait fait v\u00e9rifier son pistolet avant de le soumettre \u00e0 l'inspection. M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 qu'il savait qu'il ne pouvait se permettre la moindre erreur dans sa formation \u00e0 ce moment. Il \u00e9tait tellement s\u00fbr que son pistolet \u00e9tait propre quand le caporal Boyer lui a dit qu'il \u00e9tait sale qu'il a demand\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me avis.\n[130] Le caporal Bradley et le caporal H\u00e9bert ont affirm\u00e9 que, dans une situation o\u00f9 il y a d\u00e9saccord, c'est une bonne id\u00e9e d'obtenir un deuxi\u00e8me avis. Le sergent Guay, par contre, a jug\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9. Cependant, selon la preuve, il arrive que des deuxi\u00e8mes avis soient donn\u00e9s en formation et que les instructeurs en Formation au tir inspectent les pistolets ensemble pour assurer qu'ils en \u00e9valuent bien la propret\u00e9. Pourtant, le caporal Boyer a refus\u00e9 de le faire. Il \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re parce que M. Tahmourpour avait eu la t\u00e9m\u00e9rit\u00e9 de demander un deuxi\u00e8me avis. En cons\u00e9quence, il a attribu\u00e9 un I \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour, m\u00eame s'il aurait pu attribuer un AR si le pistolet avait bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 sale.\n[131] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tahmourpour demeure la version la plus claire des faits qui se sont produits le 9 septembre. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9 l'affirmation de M. Tahmourpour selon laquelle son pistolet \u00e9tait propre le 9 septembre 1999.\n[132] Le caporal Boyer se souvenait bien de l'inspection du 28 septembre. Cependant, sa description de l'incident diff\u00e9rait grandement de celle de M. Tahmourpour. Le caporal Boyer a affirm\u00e9 avoir fait l'inspection lui-m\u00eame. Il a conclu que M. Tahmourpour avait bien nettoy\u00e9 la plupart de son pistolet. Toutefois, il restait un morceau de carbone dans la portion du chargeur o\u00f9 se ramassent souvent des r\u00e9sidus. Le caporal Boyer a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9loger ce morceau de carbone assez facilement avec un stylo.\n[133] De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 que le caporal Jacques a inspect\u00e9 son pistolet le 28 septembre et avait convenu, apr\u00e8s un examen plus approfondi, que la salet\u00e9 apparente \u00e9tait en fait une d\u00e9coloration en relief \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'arme.\n[134] La question se r\u00e9duit donc \u00e0 une question de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Malheureusement, ni l'un ni l'autre n'ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage constamment cr\u00e9dible tout au long de l'audience. Chacun avait tendance \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter la preuve d'une mani\u00e8re servant ses propres fins. Ainsi, il est difficile de d\u00e9terminer ce qui s'est r\u00e9ellement produit.\n[135] Comme c'est souvent le cas, la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 se trouve probablement quelque part entre les deux versions des faits. D'apr\u00e8s mon interpr\u00e9tation de la preuve, le caporal Jacques a inspect\u00e9 le pistolet de M. Tahmourpour le 28 septembre 1999. Il a dit \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour que son pistolet \u00e9tait sale. Cependant, M. Tahmourpour a soulign\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'une salet\u00e9 mais d'une d\u00e9coloration en relief. Plut\u00f4t que de se disputer avec M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 ce sujet, le caporal Jacques l'a envoy\u00e9 s'exercer au tir sur le champ de tir. (La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9lait que cette pratique visait \u00e0 enseigner aux cadets les effets d'un pistolet sale.) Plus tard, quand le caporal Boyer a appris ce qui s'\u00e9tait produit, il a inspect\u00e9 l'arme de M. Tahmourpour pour voir s'il y avait une d\u00e9coloration en relief. Il n'a pas trouv\u00e9 de tel d\u00e9faut. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable d'\u00e9mietter le r\u00e9sidu de carbone du pistolet de M. Tahmourpour avec un stylo. Puisque M. Tahmourpour venait tout juste d'utiliser son arme, il est probable qu'il y ait eu du carbone dans le chargeur.\n[136] Je ne crois pas que l'on puisse savoir, avec le moindre degr\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cision, si le pistolet de M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait sale le 28 septembre. Ce qui peut \u00eatre affirm\u00e9, par contre, c'est que deux rencontres tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gatives ont eu lieu le 9 septembre et le 28 septembre 1999 \u00e0 propos de la propret\u00e9 du pistolet de M. Tahmourpour, rencontres auxquelles le caporal Boyer n'a pas bien r\u00e9agi. Il a fait preuve d'un degr\u00e9 d'animosit\u00e9 envers M. Tahmourpour que n'explique pas enti\u00e8rement le fait que M. Tahmourpour a contest\u00e9 l'avis de ses instructeurs.\n[137] La demande d'examen du dossier n'est faite que lorsqu'un cadet a re\u00e7u deux I dans la m\u00eame comp\u00e9tence (en l'esp\u00e8ce, la propret\u00e9 du pistolet). L'I que M. Tahmourpour a re\u00e7u du caporal Boyer le 9 septembre 1999 \u00e9tait le seul I qu'il avait re\u00e7u en formation jusqu'\u00e0 ce moment. Ainsi, m\u00eame si le pistolet de M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait bel et bien sale le 28 septembre 1999, il \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9 pour le caporal Boyer de demander un examen du dossier le 30 septembre 1999; au mieux, la demande n'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e que sur le seul I attribu\u00e9 pour la propret\u00e9 du pistolet. En fait, m\u00eame si le pistolet de M. Tahmourpour avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sale le 28 septembre 1999, le caporal Boyer aurait pu lui attribuer un AR. Il a choisi de ne pas le faire.\n[138] Compte tenu de la preuve directe et indirecte d\u00e9montrant l'attitude discriminatoire du caporal Boyer envers M. Tahmourpour, je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la race, la religion ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique de M. Tahmourpour a constitu\u00e9 un facteur de l'\u00e9valuation qu'a faite le caporal Boyer de la propret\u00e9 du pistolet de M. Tahmourpour le 9 septembre ainsi que le 28 septembre 1999.\n[139] Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je conclus donc que la demande d'examen de dossier pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le caporal Boyer \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9e et fond\u00e9e, du moins en partie, sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n(c) La Feuille d'\u00e9valuation de la performance du cadet du 8 octobre et la demande de r\u00e9siliation du 7 octobre\n[140] Le 7 octobre 1999, le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande pour que soit r\u00e9sili\u00e9 le contrat de formation de M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 la suite de leur examen de son dossier. Les deux I que M. Tahmourpour avait re\u00e7us pour l'inspection de son pistolet ont entra\u00een\u00e9 l'examen de son dossier, ce qui a finalement men\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de r\u00e9siliation du contrat de M. Tahmourpour. La demande de r\u00e9siliation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e un jour avant que prenne fin le mois accord\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour pour qu'il am\u00e9liore son rendement en SPA.\n[141] Dans la demande de r\u00e9siliation, le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques ont \u00e9crit que M. Tahmourpour allait recevoir cinq autres I en SPA le jour suivant, le 8 octobre, dans une Feuille d'\u00e9valuation de la performance du cadet. Le 8 octobre marquait la fin du mois accord\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour pour qu'il s'am\u00e9liore en SPA. Le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques ont affirm\u00e9 que, malgr\u00e9 les efforts \u00e9vidents de M. Tahmourpour, ce dernier n'avait montr\u00e9 [traduction] aucune am\u00e9lioration r\u00e9elle dans les domaines de SPA dans lesquels il avait des lacunes en septembre. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 que, par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de r\u00e9siliation n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e uniquement sur les deux I en Formation au tir. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9galement fond\u00e9e sur les cinq I qu'il allait recevoir en SPA.\n[142] M. Tahmourpour a contest\u00e9 tout le contenu de la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation de la performance du cadet dat\u00e9e du 8 octobre 1999 ainsi que la demande de r\u00e9siliation dat\u00e9e du 7 octobre 1999. Il a maintenu qu'elles \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur de fausses \u00e9valuations, des exag\u00e9rations et une sous-estimation de son rendement au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Voici deux exemples de ses all\u00e9gations \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard :\n(1) Selon la demande de r\u00e9siliation, M. Tahmourpour avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 apprendre et \u00e0 appliquer les techniques montr\u00e9es en Tactiques polici\u00e8res d\u00e9fensives et ses habilit\u00e9s dans ce domaine laissaient \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 que ces affirmations \u00e9taient inexactes. Il a soutenu que l'instructeur de TPD, le caporal Sloan, lui a dit qu'elle \u00e9tait satisfaite de son rendement en TPD. Il a \u00e9chou\u00e9 son premier examen en TPD le 25 ao\u00fbt 1999, parce qu'il avait mal ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 la technique de menottage (ce pour quoi il a re\u00e7u un AR), mais il s'\u00e9tait am\u00e9lior\u00e9 et il avait r\u00e9ussi la reprise avec le caporal Brock, un instructeur reconnu comme \u00e9tant exigeant, mais juste (l'AR a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par un P le 1er octobre 1999).\n[143] La demande de r\u00e9siliation indique que le caporal Sloan ne croyait pas que la reprise de TPD \u00e9tait un bon indicateur des habilet\u00e9s de M. Tahmourpour en TPD parce qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un des examens les plus difficiles. Il portait sur une situation d'attitude combative o\u00f9 il n'y avait pas beaucoup de d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 prendre.\n[144] M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il savait que cet opinion n'\u00e9tait pas celle du caporal Sloan. Lors d'une r\u00e9union ayant eu lieu le 7 octobre 2008 dans le but de discuter de la demande de r\u00e9siliation, il a demand\u00e9 au caporal Jacques et au caporal Bradley s'ils pouvaient inviter le caporal Sloan \u00e0 la r\u00e9union pour qu'elle apporte des pr\u00e9cisions sur ce qu'elle pensait des habilet\u00e9s en TPD de M. Tahmourpour et de la reprise. On n'a pas acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 sa demande.\n[145] Il y a une diff\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable entre le libell\u00e9 de la demande de r\u00e9siliation dat\u00e9e du 7 octobre 1999 et la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation de la performance du cadet dat\u00e9e du 8 octobre 1999. Dans cette derni\u00e8re, le caporal Jacques a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il a observ\u00e9 l'examen de reprise et qu'il a eu l'impression que l'examen ne permettait pas \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour de d\u00e9montrer suffisamment d'habilet\u00e9s pour changer son AR en P. Cette formulation donne \u00e0 penser que c'est le caporal Jacques, et non le caporal Sloan, qui croyait que la reprise de TPD ne constituait pas un bon indicateur des habilet\u00e9s de M. Tahmourpour.\n[146] Peu importe si la reprise de TPD constituait ou non un bon indicateur des habilet\u00e9s de M. Tahmourpour, au moment o\u00f9 la demande de r\u00e9siliation a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il n'avait aucun AR en TPD. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon M. Tahmourpour, il \u00e9tait inexact et injuste d'all\u00e9guer qu'il avait des lacunes en TPD. S'il avait des lacunes, il y aurait d\u00fb y avoir des AR \u00e0 son dossier puisqu'un AR doit \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 pour un rendement qui est le moindrement insatisfaisant. Si aucune \u00e9valuation formelle n'est donn\u00e9e, le cadet doit pr\u00e9sumer que son rendement est professionnel, selon les Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation du cadet.\n(2) Le document demandant la r\u00e9siliation du contrat de M. Tahmourpour pr\u00e9cise que celui-ci allait recevoir cinq I en SPA parce qu'il n'avait pas montr\u00e9 d'am\u00e9lioration dans les domaines dont il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question un mois plus t\u00f4t. Ces domaines \u00e9taient la communication, la prise de d\u00e9cision, la planification et la coordination, la gestion du risque et l'auto-\u00e9valuation, tels que d\u00e9montr\u00e9s dans les sc\u00e9narios, en Conditionnement physique, en Sciences polici\u00e8res appliqu\u00e9es et en Formation au tir.\n[147] M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 que, contrairement \u00e0 ce que disaient la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation du 8 octobre et la demande de r\u00e9siliation, il avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une r\u00e9elle am\u00e9lioration dans ces domaines de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\nBien qu'il n'ait pas bien r\u00e9ussi le premier sc\u00e9nario o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait question de violence conjugale le 18 ao\u00fbt 1999, le 30 septembre 1999, le caporal Jacques a soulign\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait am\u00e9lior\u00e9, bien qu'il ait commis certaines erreurs. M. Tahmourpour n'a pas re\u00e7u d'AR pour son rendement dans ce sc\u00e9nario. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon les Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation du cadet, son rendement dans le cadre de ce sc\u00e9nario \u00e9tait jug\u00e9 professionnel (P). Il s'agissait d'une am\u00e9lioration par rapport au sc\u00e9nario de violence conjugale du 18 ao\u00fbt. M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que sa seconde visite de d\u00e9tachement, le 24 septembre 1999 ou vers cette date, s'\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9e. Les visites de d\u00e9tachement, qui ont lieu environ \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 de la formation, sont une visite \u00e0 un d\u00e9tachement fictif de la GRC o\u00f9 les cadets sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9agir \u00e0 certaines situations, tout comme s'ils \u00e9taient des policiers en service dans un d\u00e9tachement de la GRC quelque part au Canada. Dans le cadre des sc\u00e9narios de d\u00e9tachement, les cadets doivent int\u00e9grer et appliquer de nombreuses habilet\u00e9s qu'ils ont apprises dans diff\u00e9rentes sections de la formation. La visite se d\u00e9roule en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur une p\u00e9riode de deux jours. Le rendement de M. Tahmourpour le deuxi\u00e8me jour a \u00e9t\u00e9 supervis\u00e9 par le caporal Torsky. M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 que le caporal Torsky \u00e9tait [traduction] exceptionnellement satisfait de son rendement le second jour des visites de d\u00e9tachement. Il n'a pas re\u00e7u d'\u00e9valuation, ce qui veut dire que son rendement dans le cadre de ce sc\u00e9nario \u00e9tait au niveau professionnel. M. Tahmourpour a tr\u00e8s bien r\u00e9ussi l'examen du simulateur de formation au tir. Le simulateur est un syst\u00e8me informatis\u00e9 sur grand \u00e9cran de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qui tient compte des r\u00e9actions du cadet. M. Tahmourpour s'est fait dire que le simulateur \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s difficile et, en fait, qu'il \u00e9tait plus difficile que tout autre sc\u00e9nario. Il s'est identifi\u00e9 comme policier et a pu se d\u00e9fendre contre de nombreux attaquants fictifs. Le caporal Jacques a dit \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour qu'il \u00e9tait assez impressionn\u00e9 du rendement de M. Tahmourpour sur le simulateur de formation au tir. M. Tahmourpour a bien r\u00e9ussi en tir instinctif. Le tir instinctif est une technique o\u00f9 la personne vise la cible, mais sans utiliser le dispositif de vis\u00e9e de son pistolet, puis fait feu sur la cible. Il est tr\u00e8s difficile d'acqu\u00e9rir cette technique et il faut beaucoup s'exercer pour la ma\u00eetriser. M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 que la demande de r\u00e9siliation ne tenait pas compte du fait qu'il avait r\u00e9ussi le Test d'aptitudes physiques essentielles (TAPE) les deux fois et qu'il avait diminu\u00e9 son temps de TAPE de 35 secondes au cours des 24 semaines pass\u00e9es au D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n[148] M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9tabli prima facie que les habilet\u00e9s jug\u00e9es dans le cadre du programme n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e9quitablement dans la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation de la performance du cadet et dans le demande de r\u00e9siliation. Ses accomplissements et ses am\u00e9liorations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 att\u00e9nu\u00e9s ou enti\u00e8rement omis. Son rendement en TPD n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e9quitablement.\n[149] Le Dr Wortley a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la discrimination syst\u00e9mique se manifeste souvent par la sous-estimation ou l'att\u00e9nuation des habilet\u00e9s d'un individu. Il a \u00e9mis l'hypoth\u00e8se que la discrimination syst\u00e9mique soit une des raisons expliquant que le taux d'attrition des cadets appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible au D\u00e9p\u00f4t soit \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le double de celui des cadets n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Tahmourpour fr\u00e9quentait le D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n[150] Le Dr Wortley a analys\u00e9 trois groupes de donn\u00e9es fournies par la GRC relativement aux taux d'attrition et d'\u00e9chec au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Attrition fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux d\u00e9parts avant la fin du programme pour un certain nombre de raisons, dont l'\u00e9chec, des motifs personnels et la mauvaise conduite. Le premier groupe de donn\u00e9es fournies par la GRC portait sur les taux d'attrition pour la p\u00e9riode allant de 1996 \u00e0 2000. Ces statistiques montraient un taux d'attrition pour les cadets n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible au D\u00e9p\u00f4t de 5,97 % pour cette p\u00e9riode de cinq ans. Le taux moyen d'attrition pour les minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e9tait de 13,35 % pour la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans en question. Pour l'ann\u00e9e 1999-2000, ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 le contrat de M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9 au D\u00e9p\u00f4t, le taux d'attrition pour les minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e9tait de 16,98 % et de 6,88 % pour les cadets n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible.\n[151] Le second groupe de statistiques, concernant les taux d'attrition pour la p\u00e9riode allant de 1996 \u00e0 2001, r\u00e9v\u00e9lait un rapport semblable. Le taux d'attrition pour les minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e9tait 2,24 fois plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que le taux pour les cadets n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible. Le Dr Wortley a affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une diff\u00e9rence significative.\n[152] Le troisi\u00e8me groupe de statistiques portait sur le taux d'\u00e9chec des cadets au D\u00e9p\u00f4t de 1998 \u00e0 2003. Le taux d'\u00e9chec est un sous-ensemble du taux d'attrition. Le taux d'attrition comprend les cadets qui ont quitt\u00e9 le programme pour des motifs personnels, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9s pour mauvaise conduite et qui ont \u00e9chou\u00e9. Le troisi\u00e8me groupe de statistiques montrait que le taux d'\u00e9chec chez les cadets appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible dans le programme de formation (12,22 %) \u00e9tait presque le double de celui des candidats caucasiens (6,5 %). En outre, l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait au D\u00e9p\u00f4t, le taux d'\u00e9chec pour les cadets de minorit\u00e9 visible (19,6 %) \u00e9tait presque trois fois plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui pour les cadets caucasiens (7,0 %). La m\u00eame chose peut \u00eatre dite de l'ann\u00e9e 2000-2001.\n[153] J'accepte l'affirmation du Dr Wortley selon laquelle, malgr\u00e9 quelques probl\u00e8mes avec la fa\u00e7on dont la GRC a obtenu et rapport\u00e9 ces statistiques, celles-ci constituent les meilleurs renseignements disponibles. J'accepte \u00e9galement son affirmation selon laquelle elles refl\u00e8tent le nombre r\u00e9el de cadets qui ont pris part au programme, et non un \u00e9chantillon. Par cons\u00e9quent, les questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la grosseur de l'\u00e9chantillon dans la recherche en science sociale ne poseront pas probl\u00e8me en l'esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que ces statistiques sont fiables, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[154] En me fondant sur cette preuve, je conclus que, au cours de l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 M. Tahmourpour a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 le D\u00e9p\u00f4t, le taux d'attrition pour les cadets appartenant aux minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e9tait de 16,98 % et de 6,88 % pour les cadets n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible. Le taux d'\u00e9chec \u00e9tait de 19,6 % pour les cadets de minorit\u00e9s visibles et de 7 % pour les autres.\n[155] Compte tenu de la preuve indirecte sur la diff\u00e9rence des taux d'attrition et les attitudes discriminatoires envers les membres et les cadets de minorit\u00e9s visibles, j'estime qu'il est raisonnable de conclure que l'att\u00e9nuation et la sous-estimation des habilet\u00e9s de M. Tahmourpour dans la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation du 8 octobre et dans la demande de r\u00e9siliation \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es, du moins en partie, sur sa race, sa religion ou son origine nationale ou ethnique. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Tahmourpour a donc fait la preuve prima facie de cette all\u00e9gation.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[156] La GRC a ni\u00e9 l'existence de racisme syst\u00e9mique au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le Dr Garry Bell, un employ\u00e9 de la GRC, en tant que t\u00e9moin expert pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'analyse qu'a faite le Dr Wortley des donn\u00e9es sur les taux d'attrition. Le Dr Bell \u00e9tait l'officier en charge par int\u00e9rim de la Formation des cadets qui a accept\u00e9 la recommandation que la candidature de M. Tahmourpour ne soit pas prise en compte pour une nouvelle admission au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Compte tenu de l'\u00e9troitesse de ses liens avec l'une des parties en l'esp\u00e8ce et de sa participation \u00e0 l'un des incidents faisant l'objet du litige, le Tribunal est d'avis que l'effet pr\u00e9judiciable de l'opinion du Dr Bell l'emporterait de beaucoup sur sa valeur probante. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n'a pas permis au Dr Bell de t\u00e9moigner en tant qu'expert en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[157] La GRC a fourni des donn\u00e9es indiquant que les taux d'attrition pour les membres r\u00e9guliers de la GRC pour la p\u00e9riode allant de 1997 \u00e0 2004 \u00e9tait beaucoup plus bas que celui pour les membres n'appartenant pas \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles. La GRC a \u00e9galement produit une d\u00e9claration de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, dat\u00e9e du 16 mai 2007, dans laquelle cette derni\u00e8re affirme que la GRC a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle satisfaisait aux obligations que lui conf\u00e8re la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi pour ce qui est de ses membres r\u00e9guliers. Ces obligations obligent la GRC \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir et \u00e0 enlever tous les obstacles \u00e0 l'emploi auxquels se butent les femmes, les autochtones, les membres de minorit\u00e9s visibles et les personnes handicap\u00e9es.\n[158] La preuve produite par l'intim\u00e9e concernant ses obligations d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi et le taux d'attrition des membres r\u00e9guliers ne concernait pas la situation des cadets au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Elle s'appliquait exclusivement aux individus qui sont employ\u00e9s par la GRC. Les cadets au D\u00e9p\u00f4t ne sont pas encore employ\u00e9s par la GRC. Ils ne sont pas pay\u00e9s pour fr\u00e9quenter l'\u00c9cole de la GRC et ils ne sont pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des employ\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que la GRC n'a pas fourni de preuve r\u00e9futant la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Tahmourpour concernant les taux d'attrition au D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n[159] La GRC a pr\u00e9tendu que la race, la religion ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique de M. Tahmourpour n'avait absolument rien \u00e0 voir avec son renvoi. Il a simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de d\u00e9montrer qu'il poss\u00e9dait les habilet\u00e9s requises \u00e0 un certain moment durant la formation et n'a pas montr\u00e9 qu'il allait \u00eatre en mesure de le faire \u00e0 l'avenir. La GRC a ni\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 injustement.\n[160] Le caporal Bradley a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, bien que M. Tahmourpour ait pu r\u00e9ussir la reprise en TPD avec le caporal Brock, le sc\u00e9nario dans la reprise ne donnait pas \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour l'occasion de tester les domaines consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant ses faiblesses en SPA : la communication, la prise de d\u00e9cision, la gestion des risques et l'auto-\u00e9valuation. Cette affirmation peut expliquer pourquoi, un jour apr\u00e8s l'entrevue lors de laquelle M. Tahmourpour avait contest\u00e9 l'affirmation voulant que le caporal Sloan ait dit qu'il \u00e9tait faible en TPD, la Feuille d'\u00e9valuation du 8 octobre 1999 faisait savoir que le caporal Jacques ne croyait pas que la reprise \u00e9tait un bon indicateur du rendement relatif aux SPA de M. Tahmourpour.\n[161] Cependant, l'explication de la GRC n'explique pas pourquoi M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant faible en TPD. Le caporal Bradley a reconnu que le caporal Brock, qui a men\u00e9 le second examen de TPD et enlev\u00e9 l'AR de M. Tahmourpour dans cette mati\u00e8re, \u00e9tait un instructeur de TPD extr\u00eamement comp\u00e9tent et qu'on ne pouvait trouver \u00e0 redire \u00e0 son \u00e9valuation des habilet\u00e9s de M. Tahmourpour en TPD. M. Tahmourpour n'a pas re\u00e7u d'AR en TPD sauf pour le premier examen, note qui a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9e avec le caporal Brock. Par cons\u00e9quent, ses habilet\u00e9s en TPD aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant professionnelles et n'aurait pas d\u00fb faire l'objet de commentaires dans la demande de r\u00e9siliation. Si M. Tahmourpour n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 formellement, au moyen d'une cote AR en TPD, que son rendement \u00e9tait insatisfaisant au point de pouvoir mener \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat, il \u00e9tait en droit de pr\u00e9sumer que son rendement en TPD \u00e9tait professionnel.\n[162] Fait significatif, le caporal Sloan, qui aurait formul\u00e9 les commentaires n\u00e9gatifs au sujet du rendement de M. Tahmourpour en TPD, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner par la GRC.\n[163] J'estime que la GRC n'a pas fourni d'explication raisonnable concernant l'\u00e9valuation et la description n\u00e9gative du rendement de M. Tahmourpour en TPD.\n[164] Le caporal Bradley a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage tr\u00e8s convaincant au sujet des difficult\u00e9s qu'\u00e9prouvait M. Tahmourpour en communication et en auto-\u00e9valuation en SPA. Au cours du t\u00e9moignage de M. Tahmourpour, j'ai observ\u00e9 certaines des m\u00eames faiblesses. Par exemple, sa capacit\u00e9 de s'auto-\u00e9valuer m'a sembl\u00e9 faible. Il a affirm\u00e9 que, comme tous les cadets, il avait des faiblesses. Pourtant, quand on lui a demand\u00e9 quelles \u00e9taient ces faiblesses, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de r\u00e9pondre. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, l'id\u00e9e que se faisait M. Tahmourpour de l'\u00e9coute active \u00e9tait de prendre de bonnes notes. J'ai \u00e9galement remarqu\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour donnait souvent des r\u00e9ponses vagues aux questions que lui posaient son propre avocat et l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e en contre-interrogatoire. En particulier, ses r\u00e9ponses aux questions concernant ses activit\u00e9s apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part du D\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9taient peu claires, contradictoires et difficiles \u00e0 suivre.\n[165] Je prend \u00e9galement note du t\u00e9moignage de trois camarades de troupe de M. Tahmourpour selon lesquels ses habilet\u00e9s en certains domaines \u00e9taient si faibles qu'ils avaient peur de travailler avec lui sur le terrain. Des t\u00e9moignages cr\u00e9dibles r\u00e9v\u00e9laient que M. Tahmourpour peinait \u00e0 se montrer comp\u00e9tent dans les sc\u00e9narios, ce qui d\u00e9coulait en grande partie de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9couter les gens, \u00e0 int\u00e9grer les renseignements re\u00e7us et \u00e0 prendre les mesures appropri\u00e9es en fonction de ces renseignements.\n[166] Cependant, je suis troubl\u00e9e par le fait que des \u00e9valuations sans doute l\u00e9gitimes des faiblesses du rendement de M. Tahmourpour au D\u00e9p\u00f4t ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incluses parmi des \u00e9valuations, comme celle en TPD, celle sur la propret\u00e9 du pistolet et celle de la vaporisation de gaz poivr\u00e9, qui \u00e9taient incorrectes ou qui sous-estimaient ses habilet\u00e9s.\n[167] En outre, l'\u00e9valuation du rendement du cadet fournie un mois (environ) apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9valuation du 8 septembre indiquait que M. Tahmourpour n'avait fait aucun v\u00e9ritable progr\u00e8s. Pour cette raison, il a re\u00e7u les cinq I qui fondaient une partie de la demande de r\u00e9siliation. Pourtant les t\u00e9moins de la GRC on convenu que M. Tahmourpour avait am\u00e9lior\u00e9 son temps de TAPE et qu'il avait bien r\u00e9ussi en tir instinctif ainsi que l'examen sur le simulateur de formation au tir. Le caporal Jacques a affirm\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour avait eu un rendement professionnel le second jour de la visite de d\u00e9tachement et qu'il avait montr\u00e9 suffisamment d'am\u00e9lioration dans le sc\u00e9nario de violence conjugale pour qu'aucune \u00e9valuation formelle ne soit \u00e9mise. Pourtant, ces am\u00e9liorations et ce bon rendement ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9valuation du rendement du cadet d'un mois.\n[168] Tous les accomplissements positifs inscrits dans l'\u00e9valuation sont diminu\u00e9s. M. Tahmourpour a r\u00e9ussi son examen de TPD, mais l'examen n'\u00e9tait pas un bon indicateur de ses habilet\u00e9s en SPA. Il a r\u00e9ussi son examen de SPA, mais il ne pouvait appliquer les connaissances dont il avait fait d\u00e9monstration \u00e0 l'examen. Bien que cela puisse \u00eatre vrai, l'absence de ses r\u00e9ussites dans les domaines mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus dressent un portrait tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rent de M. Tahmourpour que si elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 incluses.\n[169] Le caporal H\u00e9bert a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans une demande de r\u00e9siliation, il est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que les domaines dont il n'est pas fait mention sont au niveau professionnel; seuls les domaines probl\u00e9matiques sont mentionn\u00e9s. J'accepte cette explication dans la mesure o\u00f9 la demande de r\u00e9siliation est concern\u00e9e, mais pour ce qui est de l'\u00e9valuation de suivi apr\u00e8s un mois, je n'ai pas entendu d'explication convaincante justifiant pourquoi l'am\u00e9lioration de M. Tahmourpour n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9e. En outre, je n'ai pas obtenu d'explication convaincante montrant pourquoi les moniteurs n'ont pas attendu d'avoir rempli l'\u00e9valuation de suivi apr\u00e8s un mois avant de demander la r\u00e9siliation du contrat de M. Tahmourpour.\n[170] Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 si l'am\u00e9lioration en TPD, la seconde journ\u00e9e de la visite de d\u00e9tachement et l'absence d'AR dans le second sc\u00e9nario de violence conjugale constituaient de [traduction] l'am\u00e9lioration, le caporal Bradley a simplement maintenu que M. Tahmourpour n'avait pas montr\u00e9 d'am\u00e9lioration. De toute \u00e9vidence, ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas. L'am\u00e9lioration pouvait ne pas sembler suffisante aux yeux du caporal Bradley et du caporal Jacques pour les faire changer d'avis quant aux aptitudes de M. Tahmourpour pour le travail policier. Cependant, l'omission de pr\u00e9senter de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e le rendement de M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 ce moment dans la formation, ainsi que l'inclusion d'\u00e9valuations inexactes, donne fortement \u00e0 penser qu'un autre facteur a influenc\u00e9 leur examen du dossier de M. Tahmourpour. La GRC n'a pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la preuve prima facie pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Tahmourpour selon laquelle sa race, sa religion ou son origine nationale ou ethnique a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans l'examen de son dossier et la demande de r\u00e9siliation de son contrat de formation.\n[171] J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage du caporal Bradley selon lequel elle entretenait de v\u00e9ritables doutes relativement aux habilet\u00e9s \u00e0 communiquer, au jugement et \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9soudre des probl\u00e8mes de M. Tahmourpour. Elle ne croyait pas qu'il serait en mesure de faire le travail d'un policier en raison de ces lacunes. Cependant, le probl\u00e8me de cette explication est que, dans un milieu de formation o\u00f9 les commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants \u00e0 propos de la race sont approuv\u00e9s et adress\u00e9s \u00e0 des personnes comme M. Tahmourpour, o\u00f9 les \u00e9valuations sont inexactes et inad\u00e9quates et o\u00f9 les instructeurs sont fiers d'\u00eatre politiquement incorrects, il est difficile pour une personne comme M. Tahmourpour de se d\u00e9velopper et de d\u00e9montrer ses habilet\u00e9s dans ces domaines. J'estime raisonnable de conclure que de telles conclusions \u00e9rodent la confiance en soi et la capacit\u00e9 de bien r\u00e9ussir. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'explication de l'intim\u00e9e selon laquelle le rendement de M. Tahmourpour au D\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9tait faible n'est pas convaincante. Le rendement de M. Tahmourpour, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 par la discrimination dont il a fait l'objet.\nC. La d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9silier le contrat de M. Tahmourpour [172] Le 20 octobre 1999, le Commandant du D\u00e9p\u00f4t, le surintendant en chef Lynn Twardosky, a r\u00e9sili\u00e9 le contrat de formation de M. Tahmourpour. La d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la recommandation formul\u00e9e par le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques au Commandant. Dans sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9crite, le Commandant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle souscrivait \u00e0 la [traduction] d\u00e9cision du caporal Bradley et du caporal Jacques de r\u00e9silier le contrat de M. Tahmourpour.\n[173] La recommandation et la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9silier le contrat de M. Tahmourpour \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur des \u00e9valuations discriminatoires des habilet\u00e9s de M. Tahmourpour. En outre, elles \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur son rendement dans un programme o\u00f9 il n'a pas eu l'occasion comme les autres cadets de se d\u00e9velopper et de d\u00e9montrer ses habilet\u00e9s et capacit\u00e9s au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la r\u00e9siliation du contrat de formation de M. Tahmourpour.\nD. L'\u00e9valuation des qualit\u00e9s de M. Tahmourpour en vue d'une r\u00e9admission [174] M. Tahmourpour s'est fait dire qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas rare que des cadets \u00e9chouent le programme de formation et soient admis de nouveau par la GRC plus tard. Lorsque son contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9, M. Tahmourpour a esp\u00e9r\u00e9 que ce serait le cas pour lui. Cependant, \u00e0 son \u00e9tonnement, il a d\u00e9couvert qu'une note de service, dat\u00e9e du 23 d\u00e9cembre 1999, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans son dossier et pr\u00e9cisait que la division du recrutement ne devait pas prendre sa candidature en consid\u00e9ration pour une r\u00e9admission.\n[175] L'auteur de la note de service, le sergent Champigny, \u00e9tait gestionnaire de carri\u00e8res au D\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Le sergent Champigny n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Cependant, dans sa note de service, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, durant le processus de r\u00e9siliation, M. Tahmourpour a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des sympt\u00f4mes physiques qui semblaient li\u00e9s au stress. Il a signal\u00e9 que, en deux occasions distinctes, des camarades de troupe de M. Tahmourpour ont d\u00fb l'escorter au Centre des services m\u00e9dicaux parce qu'il souffrait de vomissements, de tremblements, d'hyperventilation et qu'il \u00e9tait incoh\u00e9rent. Le sergent Champigny a \u00e9crit que le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques avaient consult\u00e9 le psychologue interne de la division F (aucun nom n'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9) qui a d\u00e9crit le comportement de M. Tahmourpour comme \u00e9tant une [traduction] id\u00e9ation suicidaire passive. Le sergent Champigny a \u00e9crit qu'une discussion subs\u00e9quente avec le Dr Roy, un autre psychologue \u00e0 l'emploi de la GRC, a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que ce dernier nourrissait des doutes quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de M. Tahmourpour de g\u00e9rer les situations difficiles et exigeantes. Le Dr Roy ne recommanderait pas la r\u00e9admission de M. Tahmourpour.\n[176] M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 s'\u00eatre rendu une fois au Centre des services m\u00e9dicaux, le 15 octobre 1999, afin d'\u00eatre trait\u00e9 pour des vomissements, de l'hyperventilation et des tremblements. Cependant, il a affirm\u00e9 n'avoir pas rencontr\u00e9 de psychologue ou de m\u00e9decin. Il a ni\u00e9 avoir jamais eu d'id\u00e9es suicidaires. Il \u00e9tait malade, \u00e9puis\u00e9 et perturb\u00e9 par la discrimination dont il faisait l'objet au D\u00e9p\u00f4t et la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat de formation.\n[177] Apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 le D\u00e9p\u00f4t, M. Tahmourpour a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 la troupe par l'interm\u00e9diaire du caporal Bradley et du caporal Jacques dans laquelle il disait esp\u00e9rer que ses camarades de troupe et lui seraient r\u00e9unis un jour. Le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques ont trouv\u00e9 cela tr\u00e8s bizarre. Ils ont craint que M. Tahmourpour n'ait pas accept\u00e9 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de son renvoi. Le caporal Jacques a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une copie de la lettre de M. Tahmourpour au Dr Roy et a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il fasse conna\u00eetre au personnel du recrutement son opinion sur l'\u00e9tat mental de M. Tahmourpour.\n[178] M. Tahmourpour a prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des autres cadets qui n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi leur formation. On lui a refus\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre r\u00e9admis au D\u00e9p\u00f4t en raison d'un avis m\u00e9dical qu'un m\u00e9decin semble avoir donn\u00e9 sans l'avoir rencontr\u00e9. En outre, la preuve donne fortement \u00e0 penser, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, que les moniteurs de M. Tahmourpour ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le actif pour faire en sorte que M. Tahmourpour ne puisse \u00eatre r\u00e9admis au d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Compte tenu de la preuve qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de concernant le traitement discriminatoire dont a fait l'objet M. Tahmourpour et de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique au D\u00e9p\u00f4t, j'estime qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 prima facie que le fait qu'on ait priv\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour de la chance d'\u00eatre r\u00e9admis \u00e9tait fond\u00e9, du moins en partie, sur la race, la religion ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique de M. Tahmourpour.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[179] La GRC a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour \u00e9tait devenu instable mentalement apr\u00e8s avoir appris le 7 octobre 1999 que son contrat de formation allait \u00eatre r\u00e9sili\u00e9. Les psychologues \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient d'avis que la candidature de M. Tahmourpour ne devrait pas \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration pour une embauche future en raison de son \u00e9vidente incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 g\u00e9rer la pression et \u00e0 surmonter les obstacles.\n[180] Le caporal Droudy et le caporal Mangat ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que M. Tahmourpour a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se comporter de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange apr\u00e8s avoir appris que son contrat allait \u00eatre r\u00e9sili\u00e9. Il quittait le D\u00e9p\u00f4t pour de longues p\u00e9riodes sans porter de manteau, il dormait beaucoup les fins de semaine et il paraissait n\u00e9glig\u00e9 et \u00e9chevel\u00e9. Ils ont fait rapport de ce comportement au caporal Jacques. Ce dernier a affirm\u00e9 que le caporal Bradley et lui ont communiqu\u00e9 avec le Dr Yaholnitsky-Smith, une psychologue \u00e0 l'emploi de la GRC \u00e0 la Division F, qui leur a dit que M. Tahmourpour souffrait peut-\u00eatre d'id\u00e9ation suicidaire passive. Le caporal Jacques ne savait pas si M. Tahmourpour avait rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Yaholnitsky-Smith, mais il croyait qu'il avait rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Dufour. Ni le Dr Dufour ni le Dr Yaholnitsky-Smith n'ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Aucun dossier m\u00e9dical n'est venu confirmer que M. Tahmourpour a rencontr\u00e9 l'un ou l'autre de ces m\u00e9decins.\n[181] La note de service du sergent Champigny ne pr\u00e9cise pas que M. Tahmourpour a rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Yaholnitsky-Smith, ou que cette derni\u00e8re a pos\u00e9 un diagnostique formel. La note mentionne seulement que les moniteurs de la troupe ont [traduction] consult\u00e9 le psychologue de la Division F qui a d\u00e9crit le comportement comme \u00e9tant une [traduction] id\u00e9ation suicidaire passive.\n[182] Le psychologue \u00e0 l'emploi au D\u00e9p\u00f4t, le Dr Robert Roy, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait g\u00ean\u00e9 par le fait qu'il ne disposait pas du dossier m\u00e9dical de M. Tahmourpour; il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une politique de la GRC sur la conservation des documents. Le Dr Roy ne se souvenait d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s aucun des faits en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il a bas\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage sur ce qu'il pensait qui s'\u00e9tait produit.\n[183] Le Dr Roy ne se rappelait pas avoir rencontr\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour. Il a reconnu que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Tahmourpour allait quitter le D\u00e9p\u00f4t, il \u00e9tait probablement en vacances. Pourtant, le Dr Roy croyait qu'il devait avoir rencontr\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour, ne serait-ce que tr\u00e8s bri\u00e8vement, parce que le sergent Champigny a fait mention d'un avis qu'il aurait donn\u00e9 au sujet de M. Tahmourpour. Le Dr Roy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, s'il avait rencontr\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour, il aurait \u00e9mis beaucoup de r\u00e9serves avant de faire une d\u00e9claration au sujet de sa stabilit\u00e9 mentale. Il n'aurait pas fourni de diagnostique ferme parce qu'il \u00e9tait s\u00fbr que la consultation n'a pas dur\u00e9 longtemps. Le Dr Roy aurait recommand\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour subisse un examen psychologique complet avant d'\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 pour une r\u00e9admission.\n[184] La note de service concernant M. Tahmourpour ne recommande pas d'\u00e9valuation psychologique compl\u00e8te avant l'examen de la candidature de M. Tahmourpour pour la r\u00e9admission, ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on raisonnable d'\u00e9claircir les doutes que nourrissait la GRC au sujet de la mani\u00e8re dont r\u00e9agissait M. Tahmourpour aux d\u00e9ceptions et aux obstacles. Au lieu de cela, la recommandation de d\u00e9fendre que la candidature de M. Tahmourpour soit prise en consid\u00e9ration pour une r\u00e9admission \u00e9tait inconditionnelle et \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e au mieux sur des examens psychologiques superficiels.\n[185] La GRC n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 expliquer de fa\u00e7on convaincante que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite n'a pas constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la recommandation et la d\u00e9cision subs\u00e9quente de refuser que M. Tahmourpour soit r\u00e9admis \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole.\nV. QUE FAUT-IL PROUVER RELATIVEMENT \u00c0 L'ARTICLE 14 DE LA LOI? [186] Selon l'article 14 de la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Le harc\u00e8lement, comme l'interdit la Loi, a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement d\u00e9fini comme une conduite r\u00e9p\u00e9titive non sollicit\u00e9e li\u00e9e \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d'emploi pour les victimes (Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, \u00e0 la page 1284; Rampersadsingh c. Wignall (No. 2) (2002), 45 C.H.R.R. D\/237, au paragraphe 40 (T.C.D.P.); et Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [1999] 3 C.F. 653 (1re inst.), aux paragraphes 43 et 45).\nA. M. Tahmourpour a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite? [187] M. Tahmourpour a soutenu que la conduite du caporal Boyer constituait du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur sa race, sa religion ou son origine nationale ou ethnique. Il a affirm\u00e9 que le caporal Boyer lui a cri\u00e9 \u00e0 l'oreille \u00e0 plusieurs reprises sur le champ de tir qu'il \u00e9tait un [traduction] perdant, un [traduction] l\u00e2che et un [traduction] incomp\u00e9tent. M. Tahmourpour a dit au caporal Boyer que sa conduite le perturbait et, n\u00e9anmoins, le caporal Boyer a continu\u00e9. M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la violence verbale constante du caporal Boyer \u00e0 son \u00e9gard a affect\u00e9 sa confiance en soi et son rendement au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Le sergent Brar a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir observ\u00e9 le caporal Boyer faire montre de ce genre de comportement envers les femmes et les cadets de minorit\u00e9s visibles.\n[188] M. Tahmourpour a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques l'ont \u00e9galement harcel\u00e9 sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques le faisaient souvent sortir de la classe pour tourner en d\u00e9rision et critiquer ses traits personnels, notamment sa mani\u00e8re de s'exprimer sans \u00e9lever la voix ainsi que son habitude de s'asseoir \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re et de prendre trop de notes.\n[189] M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques le rencontraient quotidiennement sur l'heure du midi, ce qui l'emp\u00eachait de marcher avec sa troupe vers la salle \u00e0 manger. En cons\u00e9quence, selon ce qu'il affirme, il a rat\u00e9 le d\u00eener presque chaque jour, particuli\u00e8rement vers la fin de la formation, et il ratait parfois un autre repas dans la journ\u00e9e pour parler au caporal Jacques et au caporal Bradley. M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait trop g\u00ean\u00e9 pour entrer seul dans la salle \u00e0 manger apr\u00e8s ses rencontres avec le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques; tous les cadets se seraient dout\u00e9s que quelque chose n'allait pas s'il l'avait fait. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a souvent rat\u00e9 des repas.\n[190] C'est en public que le caporal Jacques et le caporal Bradley traitaient M. Tahmourpour diff\u00e9remment, selon M. Tahmourpour. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, avant de pr\u00e9senter une vid\u00e9o montrant deux policiers tu\u00e9s en devoir, le caporal Bradley a d\u00e9crit un des policiers d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s comme ressemblant \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 cause de sa mani\u00e8re de parler sans \u00e9lever la voix. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que ce ton avait \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7u comme \u00e9tant une faiblesse et avait contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la mort du policier; elle a laiss\u00e9 entendre que ce genre de policier repr\u00e9sentait un danger pour lui-m\u00eame et pour les autres policiers.\n[191] M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, le 10 septembre 1999, il a rencontr\u00e9 le caporal Jacques et le caporal Bradley pour discuter d'une \u00e9valuation de rendement. Il a affirm\u00e9 que la rencontre s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9e avec \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'animosit\u00e9. Pendant plus d'une heure, le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques ont cri\u00e9 apr\u00e8s lui d'une mani\u00e8re violente et hostile, parfois en se tenant directement devant son visage. M. Tahmourpour a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, au cours de la r\u00e9union du 10 septembre 1999, le caporal Bradley a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'arrivait pas \u00e0 comprendre son anglais.\n[192] M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9tabli une peuve prima facie qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite de la part du caporal Bradley, du caporal Jacques et du caporal Boyer. Il faut souligner que M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9galement produit la transcription d'une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique enregistr\u00e9e qu'il a eue avec un de ses camarades de troupe, l'agent Rob Lasson, au sujet de ce qu'a v\u00e9cu M. Tahmourpour au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Au mieux, il peut \u00eatre affirm\u00e9 que la transcription soutient dans une certaine mesure le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tahmourpour selon lequel ses instructeurs se sont montr\u00e9s particuli\u00e8rement durs envers lui. Par contre, la transcription est une preuve int\u00e9ress\u00e9e et constituant du ou\u00ef-dire qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 test\u00e9e en contre-interrogatoire. Je lui accorde donc tr\u00e8s peu de valeur.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[193] Le caporal Boyer a ni\u00e9 avoir harcel\u00e9 verbalement M. Tahmourpour. Cependant, compte tenu de la preuve que j'ai examin\u00e9e dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je conclus que le caporal Boyer a harcel\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour en raison de sa race, de sa religion ou de son origine nationale ou ethnique. Quand M. Tahmourpour a sign\u00e9 une feuille d'\u00e9valuation t\u00f4t dans la formation, le caporal Boyer a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour : [traduction] Quelle sorte de putain de langue est-ce que c'est, ou est-ce que c'est quelque chose que tu as invent\u00e9 ? Il a ensuite r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement d\u00e9nigr\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour en public \u00e0 cause de son mauvais rendement en formation au tir. Le caporal Boyer a \u00e9galement dit \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour : [traduction] Enl\u00e8ve-toi de ma face, merde, ou je te botte le cul!, quand M. Tahmourpour a demand\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me avis au sujet de la propret\u00e9 de son pistolet.\n[194] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tahmourpour au sujet du harc\u00e8lement verbal fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9 par ceux du sergent Brar et de l'agent McCarney. Bien que le caporal Boyer en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral parl\u00e2t d'une voix forte \u00e0 tous les cadets et se montr\u00e2t agressif envers eux, il le faisait encore plus \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Tahmourpour et des autres membres de minorit\u00e9s visibles. J'ai conclu que cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que le caporal Boyer a harcel\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite, ce qui contrevient \u00e0 l'article 14 de la Loi.\n[195] Le caporal Bradley a ni\u00e9 avoir fait sortir M. Tahmourpour de la classe ou l'avoir retenu quotidiennement sur l'heure du d\u00eener. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n'avoir eu de rencontres avec M. Tahmourpour que lorsque des \u00e9valuations formelles \u00e9taient rendues.\n[196] Le caporal Bradley a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces rencontres se d\u00e9roulaient sur un ton professionnel et diplomatique. Elle a ni\u00e9 avoir cri\u00e9 apr\u00e8s M. Tahmourpour ou lui avoir dit qu'elle ne comprenait pas son anglais. Elle a \u00e9galement ni\u00e9 avoir fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour au moment o\u00f9 elle pr\u00e9sentait une s\u00e9ance au sujet de deux agents tu\u00e9s en devoir.\n[197] Le caporal Bradley a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la proc\u00e9dure observ\u00e9e lors de chaque rencontre d'\u00e9valuation \u00e9tait conforme aux normes. La Feuille d'\u00e9valuation est examin\u00e9e. Les lacunes sont reli\u00e9es \u00e0 certains domaines d'habilet\u00e9s ou comp\u00e9tences particuli\u00e8res. On demande au cadet ses commentaires ou son opinion. Un plan d'action est \u00e9tabli pour corriger les lacunes en question, plan qui tient compte des suggestions du cadet.\n[198] Le caporal Bradley a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9valuait verbalement M. Tahmourpour pendant les cours, mais d'une mani\u00e8re constructive. En d'autres termes, elle lui disait ce qu'il faisait bien et ce qu'il pouvait am\u00e9liorer. Elle a ni\u00e9 avoir r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour qu'il ne devrait pas s'asseoir \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re et prendre des notes. Elle n'avait rien contre ce comportement; elle a plut\u00f4t dit \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour qu'il devait participer plus efficacement \u00e0 la formation.\n[199] Le t\u00e9moignage du caporal Bradley \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tait franc et convaincant. Elle m'est apparue comme \u00e9tant une personne directe, qui s'exprime bien, sans m\u00e2cher ses mots tout en demeurant professionnelle. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'accepte son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel elle n'a pas fait sortir M. Tahmourpour de la classe tous les jours pour le r\u00e9primander \u00e0 cause de son rendement.\n[200] Le caporal Jacques a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait peut-\u00eatre rencontr\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour plus fr\u00e9quemment que le caporal Bradley, mais qu'il ne rencontrait pas M. Tahmourpour quotidiennement et qu'il ne le faisait pas sortir de la classe ou ne le retenait pas sur l'heure du repas \u00e0 tous les jours. Il est possible que le caporal Jacques ait rencontr\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour plus fr\u00e9quemment que le caporal Bradley puisqu'il \u00e9tait l'instructeur de M. Tahmourpour tant en Formation au tir qu'en SPA.\n[201] Comme le t\u00e9moignage du caporal Bradley \u00e0 ce sujet, j'ai trouv\u00e9 convaincant le t\u00e9moignage du caporal Jacques relativement \u00e0 la teneur et \u00e0 la fr\u00e9quence de ses rencontres avec M. Tahmourpour. Bien que j'aie conclu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment que le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'initiative du caporal Boyer visant \u00e0 exclure M. Tahmourpour du programme de formation, l'all\u00e9gation additionnelle et distincte de comportement agressif et coercitif d\u00e9tonne par rapport \u00e0 l'ensemble de la preuve relative \u00e0 la conduite et au comportement du caporal Bradley et du caporal Jacques. L'agent McCarney, par exemple, dont j'ai trouv\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage tr\u00e8s direct et franc, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, de tous les cours qu'il avait suivis \u00e0 la GRC, aucun n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 par des instructeurs aussi patients et professionnels que le caporal Jacques et le caporal Bradley.\n[202] Au contraire, j'estime que le t\u00e9moigne de M. Tahmourpour au sujet de la fr\u00e9quence et de la teneur des rencontres qu'il a eues avec le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques est moins cr\u00e9dible. M. Tahmourpour a affirm\u00e9 que le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques l'ont fait sortir de la classe ou l'ont retenu apr\u00e8s la classe presque tous les jours pendant la formation. Vers la fin de la p\u00e9riode de formation, le nombre de ces rencontres aurait augment\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 se produire plusieurs fois par jour. En cons\u00e9quence, il aurait rat\u00e9 des repas quotidiennement. Malgr\u00e9 qu'il ait manqu\u00e9 autant de repas, M. Tahmourpour, selon son t\u00e9moignage, a pris du poids, neuf livres, et a abaiss\u00e9 son temps de TAPE de 35 secondes. Il a r\u00e9ussi cela en mangeant des biscuits et de la nourriture pr\u00eate \u00e0 emporter de Wal-Mart. J'estime que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 ce sujet est peu plausible.\n[203] M. Tahmourpour peut avoir eu l'impression de recevoir plus de r\u00e9troaction verbale et formelle que ses camarades de troupe. Cependant, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je conclus que la fr\u00e9quence \u00e0 laquelle il a rencontr\u00e9 ses instructeurs de troupe ne se rapprochait m\u00eame pas de ce qu'il a racont\u00e9. En outre, j'estime qu'il est improbable qu'il ait fait l'objet de violence verbale quand il les a rencontr\u00e9s.\n[204] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques n'ont pas harcel\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite pendant qu'il \u00e9tait au D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nVI. QUELLES MESURES DE REDRESSEMENT CONVIENT-IL D'ORDONNER EN L'ESP\u00c8CE? [205] Le Tribunal tire son pouvoir d'ordonner des mesures de redressement de l'article 53 de la Loi. Les mesures de redressement qui y sont pr\u00e9vues ont pour but de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte, de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination \u00e0 l'avenir et d'indemniser la victime pour les actes discriminatoires pass\u00e9s ou actuels.\n(i) Indemnit\u00e9 pour la conduite discriminatoire\n[206] Le but des dispositions pr\u00e9voyant une indemnisation est de fournir au plaignant une compensation pour les pertes caus\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. McAlpine (1989), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/253, au paragraphe 13 (C.A.F.)). Par cons\u00e9quent, pour \u00e9tablir qu'il a droit \u00e0 un redressement, le plaignant doit montrer qu'il existe un lien causal entre l'acte discriminatoire et la perte pour laquelle une indemnit\u00e9 est r\u00e9clam\u00e9e (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan (1991), 85 D.L.R. (4th) 473 (C.A.F.)). Jusqu'\u00e0 r\u00e9cemment, selon l'interpr\u00e9tation accept\u00e9e de l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel dans Morgan, le plaignant, pour \u00e9tablir le lien de cause \u00e0 effet, devait uniquement prouver qu'il existait une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que l'acte discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9 ait caus\u00e9 le dommage pour lequel une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e9tait demand\u00e9e (Chopra c. Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social, 2004 TCDP 27; conf. par 2007 CAF 269; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 C.F. 569 (C.F. 1re inst.); Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Green, [2000] 4 C.F. 629, au paragraphe 142 (C.F. 1re inst.); et Culic c. Postes Canada, 2007 TCDP 01). Cependant, dans l'arr\u00eat Chopra, rendu 2007, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a laiss\u00e9 entendre que le crit\u00e8re de la possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse n'avait pas fait consensus chez les trois juges qui avaient tranch\u00e9 l'affaire Morgan. Par cons\u00e9quent, ce crit\u00e8re pourrait \u00eatre remis en question. N\u00e9anmoins, je suis li\u00e9e par les d\u00e9cisions comme Green, dans laquelle la Section de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re de la possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse est le moyen de d\u00e9terminer s'il y a un lien causal entre l'acte discriminatoire et la perte.\n[207] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 il existe une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que l'acte de la partie intim\u00e9e ait caus\u00e9 le dommage pour lequel une indemnit\u00e9 est r\u00e9clam\u00e9e, toute incertitude quant \u00e0 la probabilit\u00e9 que l'acte a caus\u00e9 le dommage doit \u00eatre prise en compte dans l'\u00e9valuation du montant de l'indemnit\u00e9 (Green, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 142).\n[208] La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit une distinction entre une situation o\u00f9 l'acte discriminatoire a caus\u00e9 directement la perte d'un emploi ou un refus d'employer, situation pour laquelle la nomination ou la r\u00e9insertion constitue une mesure de redressement appropri\u00e9e, et une situation o\u00f9 l'acte discriminatoire a fait perdre au plaignant une chance d'emploi ou de formation. Dans cette derni\u00e8re situation, les tribunaux ont jug\u00e9 que le redressement appropri\u00e9 \u00e9tait d'obliger la partie intim\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir la chance perdue ou refus\u00e9e, avec ou sans indemnit\u00e9 p\u00e9cuniaire. (Voir par exemple Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Greyhound Lines of Canada (1987), 8 C.H.R.R. D\/4184 (C.A.F.); Chapdelaine c. Air Canada (1991), 15 C.H.R.R. D\/22 (Tribunal d'appel des droits de la personne) aux paragraphes 19 \u00e0 32; Bitonti c. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, 2002 BCHRT 29, au paragraphe 33; et Chopra c. Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social, 2004 TCDP 27; conf. par 2007 CAF 269).\n[209] R\u00e9cemment, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a approuv\u00e9 la distinction entre la perte d'une chance d'emploi et la perte directe d'un emploi dont il faut tenir compte dans le cadre de l'\u00e9valuation du redressement. Dans Chopra, le Tribunal a conclu qu'il existait une simple possibilit\u00e9, n\u00e9anmoins une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse, que le Dr Chopra gagne le concours de recrutement n'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire. Cependant, en tentant de quantifier la probabilit\u00e9 que le Dr Chopra gagne le concours, il a jug\u00e9 que la probabilit\u00e9 qu'il remporte le concours n'\u00e9tait que de 33,33 %. Par cons\u00e9quent, plut\u00f4t que d'ordonner sa nomination au poste, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que lui soit vers\u00e9 le salaire \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 la chance d'emploi perdue. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9duit l'indemnit\u00e9 de deux tiers pour refl\u00e9ter le degr\u00e9 d'incertitude plut\u00f4t \u00e9lev\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Chopra. En appel, le Dr Chopra a soutenu que, puisque le Tribunal avait conclu qu'il existait une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse qu'il ait pu gagner le concours, le Tribunal \u00e9tait tenu d'ordonner sa nomination au poste. La Cour n'a pas souscrit \u00e0 cet argument. Elle a conclu que le Dr Chopra avait \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9 pour ce qu'il avait perdu, soit la chance de participer \u00e0 un concours non discriminatoire afin d'\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Puisqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9 pour la chance perdue de participer \u00e0 un concours \u00e9quitable, cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d'une double indemnisation que de lui accorder le poste en tant que tel.\n[210] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'acte discriminatoire commis par la GRC a fait en sorte que M. Tahmourpour a perdu la chance de d\u00e9velopper et de d\u00e9montrer, \u00e0 son plein potentiel, les habilet\u00e9s requises pour devenir un agent de la GRC. J'estime qu'il existe une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que, s'il n'y avait pas eu discrimination, M. Tahmourpour aurait r\u00e9ussi la formation au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. En fait, le taux d'\u00e9chec pour les cadets n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible n'\u00e9tait que de 6,88 % (et le taux d'attrition, de 7 %) en 1999, ce qui indique que, lorsque la discrimination ne constitue pas un facteur, la tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 des cadets r\u00e9ussissent le programme. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce fait, je conclus qu'une des mesures de redressement appropri\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce est d'ordonner qu'il soit donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour la chance d'\u00eatre r\u00e9admis au prochain programme de formation au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Les parties peuvent \u00e9galement s'entendre sur une date de r\u00e9admission diff\u00e9rente qui leur conviendra mutuellement.\n[211] L'ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 la GRC de r\u00e9admettre M. Tahmourpour au Programme d'instruction des cadets ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une exigence qu'il r\u00e9ussisse le Programme d'instruction des cadets. M. Tahmourpour doit suivre la formation exig\u00e9e et obtenir une cote professionnelle dans toutes les comp\u00e9tences et habilet\u00e9s, comme tout autre cadet qui entreprend le Programme d'instruction des cadets. Si M. Tahmourpour termine le Programme d'instruction, il devra \u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme tous les autres cadets qui r\u00e9ussissent.\n[212] M. Tahmourpour a demand\u00e9 une ordonnance exigeant qu'il soit imm\u00e9diatement nomm\u00e9 agent r\u00e9gulier de la GRC, au niveau qu'occupent les personnes qui ont suivi la formation \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole en m\u00eame temps que lui. Pour les motifs qui suivent, j'estime qu'il ne convient pas d'accorder cette mesure de redressement.\n[213] En premier lieu, M. Tahmourpour n'a pas termin\u00e9 le programme de formation de la GRC. Il a manqu\u00e9 8 semaines d'un programme intensif de 32 semaines, lesquelles 8 semaines, selon la preuve, sont encore plus exigeantes que les semaines pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes pour ce qui est des habilet\u00e9s d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es et des connaissances acquises. Il est donc clair que M. Tahmourpour n'a pas acquis toutes les habilet\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00eatre policier. Il serait imprudent, pour dire le moins, d'ordonner \u00e0 la GRC d'accepter \u00e0 titre de membre r\u00e9gulier une personne qui ne poss\u00e8de pas encore les habilet\u00e9s pour \u00eatre policier.\n[214] En deuxi\u00e8me lieu, M. Tahmourpour n'a pas r\u00e9ussi le test de pr\u00e9cision des tirs qui constitue une exigence pour tous les agents de la GRC avant qu'ils ne soient autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 porter une arme. Le sergent Brar a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, bien qu'il existe des t\u00e2ches administratives \u00e0 la GRC qui ne n\u00e9cessitent pas l'utilisation d'une arme \u00e0 feu, tout agent, qu'il soit affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives ou non, peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 en cas de crise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter des t\u00e2ches actives n\u00e9cessitant l'utilisation d'une arme \u00e0 feu. Pour cette raison, tous les policiers, quel que soit leur poste, doivent se qualifier chaque ann\u00e9e pour l'utilisation d'une arme \u00e0 feu. M. Tahmourpour n'a pas encore d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il est capable de r\u00e9ussir ce test.\n[215] En troisi\u00e8me lieu, les habilet\u00e9s que M. Tahmourpour a acquis avec succ\u00e8s durant ses quatorze semaines de formation peuvent s'\u00eatre d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9es au cours des 8 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Il pourrait avoir besoin d'une mise \u00e0 jour.\n[216] En dernier lieu, j'ai conclu que le traitement discriminatoire dont il avait fait l'objet avait emp\u00each\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour de prouver qu'il poss\u00e9dait les connaissances et habilet\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00eatre policier. Il n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 si, dans un milieu d\u00e9pourvu de discrimination, il serait en mesure de faire la preuve de ces habilet\u00e9s et connaissances. Il faut le d\u00e9terminer avant qu'il ne soit embauch\u00e9 en tant qu'agent de la GRC.\n[217] Toutefois, ces consid\u00e9rations ne veulent pas dire que M. Tahmourpour doive reprendre le programme de formation en entier. La preuve a \u00e9tabli que, lorsque les cadets ne r\u00e9ussissent pas la formation du premier coup et sont admis une deuxi\u00e8me fois, leurs habilet\u00e9s sont \u00e9valu\u00e9es pour \u00e9tablir dans quels domaines ils ont besoin de plus de formation et dans quels domaines aucune formation suppl\u00e9mentaire n'est n\u00e9cessaire. Il faut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9valuation pour M. Tahmourpour.\nFaut-il indemniser M. Tahmourpour pour la perte de salaire due \u00e0 l'occasion perdue de terminer la formation en raison de la conduite discriminatoire de la GRC?\n[218] Oui. La conduite discriminatoire de la GRC a priv\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour de l'occasion de terminer la formation et de gagner sa vie comme agent de la GRC. Il doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour la perte du salaire qu'il aurait gagn\u00e9.\nComment faut-il calculer la perte de salaire r\u00e9sultant de l'occasion perdue?\n[219] La Cour d'appel a jug\u00e9 que l'approche adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans Chopra, consistant \u00e0 indemniser la perte de salaire tout en tenant compte de toute incertitude quant \u00e0 l'obtention du poste, constituait une mani\u00e8re acceptable d'indemniser pour une chance perdue (Chopra, au paragraphe 43). J'adopterai la m\u00eame approche.\n[220] La preuve montrait que les cadets n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible avaient 93 % de chance de terminer la formation. J'estime qu'il convient d'utiliser ce chiffre pour \u00e9tablir quelle chance avait M. Tahmourpour de terminer le programme parce que, selon la preuve que j'ai entendue et les conclusions que j'ai tir\u00e9es relativement au rendement de M. Tahmourpour dans le programme, il est raisonnable de d\u00e9duire que, en l'absence de conditions discriminatoires, M. Tahmourpour aurait eu la m\u00eame chance que les candidats n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible de r\u00e9ussir le programme. Je suis consciente des r\u00e9serves que l'on pourrait \u00e9mettre \u00e0 propos de cette d\u00e9duction : d'abord, M. Tahmourpour a montr\u00e9 dans le cadre du programme avoir certaines lacunes qui peuvent ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9es aux actes discriminatoires, ce qui aurait fait tomber ses chances de r\u00e9ussite au dessous de 93 %. Cependant, il est impossible de savoir si ces lacunes se seraient manifest\u00e9es et dans quelle mesure elles auraient affect\u00e9 les chances de succ\u00e8s de M. Tahmourpour s'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible de discrimination; toute \u00e9valuation de leur importance serait hypoth\u00e9tique au point d'\u00eatre arbitraire. Il serait injuste de r\u00e9duire l'indemnit\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour sur la base d'hypoth\u00e8ses si peu solides.\n[221] Ensuite, je n'ai pas utilis\u00e9 le taux d'attrition et le taux d'\u00e9chec des candidats de minorit\u00e9s visibles parce que, \u00e0 la suite du t\u00e9moignage du Dr Wortley, j'ai conclu que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la discrimination constitue au moins un des facteurs expliquant que le taux d'attrition des minorit\u00e9s visibles soit plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui des cadets n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible. Il ne conviendrait pas de diminuer le chiffre des chances de r\u00e9ussite de M. Tahmourpour en tenant compte d'un chiffre attribuable en partie \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires.\n[222] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que l'indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire doit \u00eatre r\u00e9duite d'abord de 7 % pour que soit refl\u00e9t\u00e9e la possibilit\u00e9 que M. Tahmourpour n'ait pas termin\u00e9 le programme pour des motifs qui n'ont rien \u00e0 voir avec la discrimination. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le taux d'attrition pour les membres r\u00e9guliers au cours des 20 premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de leur emploi est de 1 %. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas produit de statistiques quant aux taux d'attrition pour la formation en cours d'emploi.\n[223] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces statistiques, j'estime que l'indemnit\u00e9 que doit recevoir M. Tahmourpour pour le salaire perdu \u00e0 la suite de la conduite discriminatoire doit \u00eatre diminu\u00e9 de 8 % pour qu'il soit tenu compte des taux d'attrition au D\u00e9p\u00f4t et dans la Force r\u00e9guli\u00e8re.\nPour quelle p\u00e9riode M. Tahmourpour doit-il \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9?\n[224] M. Tahmourpour a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui paye le salaire et les avantages sociaux perdus de mani\u00e8re r\u00e9troactive, de 1999 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'\u00e0 sa nomination comme agent de la GRC ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, jusqu'\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision si elle est accompagn\u00e9e d'une autre ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant le compensation des pertes futures au cas o\u00f9 la nomination ne serait pas ordonn\u00e9e.\n[225] D'abord, pour ce qui est du paiement r\u00e9troactif du salaire et des avantages sociaux perdus, la Cour d'appel, dans l'arr\u00eat Chopra, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans l'exercice qu'il fait du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9 ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire, le Tribunal peut bien \u00eatre d'avis que les principes qui sous-tendent la doctrine de l'att\u00e9nuation des pertes dans d'autres contextes s'appliquent aussi dans un contexte comme celui-ci. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 encourager l'efficience \u00e9conomique en exigeant que les personnes qui ont subi des pertes prennent des mesures pour minimiser leur perte, puisqu'il n'est pas dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public de permettre que des membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 maximisent leur perte au d\u00e9triment d'autres personnes, m\u00eame si celles-ci sont responsables de la perte. Aussi un tribunal peut-il, bien qu'il n'y soit pas tenu, appliquer la doctrine de l'att\u00e9nuation des pertes dans l'exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fixer l'indemnit\u00e9 qui devra \u00eatre vers\u00e9e \u00e0 un plaignant.\n[226] J'estime qu'il convient en l'esp\u00e8ce d'examiner si M. Tahmourpour a pris des mesures pour minimiser ses pertes. La preuve de M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait faible. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il a quitt\u00e9 le D\u00e9p\u00f4t en octobre 1999, il \u00e9tait boulevers\u00e9, mais pas d\u00e9prim\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto pour se trouver du travail. Cependant, quand il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto, il s'est rendu compte qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure de travailler parce qu'il souffrait d'insomnie et \u00e9tait incapable de se concentrer. M. Tahmourpour a consult\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin qui lui a prescrit des m\u00e9dicaments pour ses troubles du sommeil. Il n'a pas pris ces m\u00e9dicaments parce qu'ils co\u00fbtaient trop cher. Il a obtenu des prestations d'aide sociale sur la base du rapport de son m\u00e9decin, selon lequel il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler. L'aide sociale rembourse les frais de m\u00e9dicaments. Plus tard dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir pris les m\u00e9dicaments quand il a eu l'argent pour les acheter.\n[227] M. Tahmourpour a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre des cours pour devenir agent immobilier en juin 2002. \u00c0 ce moment, il avait une note d'un m\u00e9decin pr\u00e9cisant qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de suivre des cours ou de travailler parce qu'il \u00e9tait trop malade. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, bien que son m\u00e9decin ait cru qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure de le faire, lui-m\u00eame croyait pouvoir le faire.\n[228] M. Tahmourpour est devenu agent immobilier d\u00e9tenteur d'un permis en 2003. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 un mauvais agent immobilier; il n'a vendu qu'une seule propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour laquelle il a re\u00e7u une commission de 5 000 $.\n[229] M. Tahmourpour a suivi des cours dans le but de devenir interpr\u00e8te et traducteur dans la langue persane. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 certifi\u00e9 par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, la province de l'Ontario et la ville de Toronto en tant qu'interpr\u00e8te de la langue persane. Il a pay\u00e9 600 $ pour devenir interpr\u00e8te. Cependant, il n'a pu gagner que 100 $ comme traducteur.\n[230] M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne lui a demand\u00e9 des efforts presque \u00e0 temps plein. Aucun employeur ne l'aurait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 s'absenter autant. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'a pas pu travailler \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en 2001 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui.\n[231] J'estime que M. Tahmourpour n'a pas fait suffisamment d'efforts pour att\u00e9nuer ses pertes de la date o\u00f9 il a quitt\u00e9 le D\u00e9p\u00f4t jusqu'au d\u00e9but de l'audience en ao\u00fbt 2007. Je conviens que, de 2000 \u00e0 2002, il lui \u00e9tait difficile de travailler en raison des r\u00e9percussions psychologiques caus\u00e9es par son exp\u00e9rience au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Le fait qu'il n'ait pas pris les m\u00e9dicaments qui lui avait prescrits son m\u00e9decin pour ses troubles me pr\u00e9occupe, mais je conviens qu'il n'avait peut-\u00eatre pas les id\u00e9es claires au cours de ces deux ann\u00e9es.\n[232] Cependant, en juin 2002, il se sentait suffisamment bien pour entreprendre un cours en immobilier, malgr\u00e9 l'avis contraire de son m\u00e9decin, selon lequel il ne pouvait ni travailler ni suivre de cours. En 2003, il a re\u00e7u son permis pour vendre des biens immobiliers et il a tent\u00e9 de le faire. Bien qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9 pour devenir traducteur, il n'a obtenu que 100 $ pour ses services pendant ce temps. Je ne suis pas convaincue que M. Tahmourpour a r\u00e9ellement tent\u00e9 de se trouver un emploi lucratif qui aurait diminu\u00e9 ses pertes. En fait, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait le faire parce que sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne prenait tout son temps.\n[233] Je ne crois pas que travailler \u00e0 sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne exigeait de M. Tahmourpour un effort \u00e0 temps plein. Je conviens que cela a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 du temps et que son dossier \u00e9tait plus difficile que la plupart des autres parce qu'il s'est rendu en Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 deux enqu\u00eates de la Commission. Il s'est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame dans le cadre de certaines proc\u00e9dures. Cependant, il semblerait que, du moins pour une partie du temps depuis 2000, M. Tahmourpour ait eu l'aide d'un avocat puisque le dossier comprend des lettres \u00e9crites par son avocat \u00e0 la GRC le 4 mai 2000. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime qu'il n'est pas raisonnable que M. Tahmourpour n'ait pu travailler du tout (sauf pour vendre une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et obtenir un contrat de traduction) de janvier 2002 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui.\n[234] Selon ce que je sais du temps que n\u00e9cessite une plainte de la nature de celle en l'esp\u00e8ce, voici des chiffres repr\u00e9sentant le temps dont aurait raisonnablement eu besoin une personne qui ne conna\u00eet pas le droit, comme M. Tahmourpour, pour effectuer les t\u00e2ches li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte :\nR\u00e9diger la plainte, collaborer avec la Commission pour fournir des renseignements pour l'enqu\u00eate, r\u00e9pondre aux documents de la Commission et mener des recherches suppl\u00e9mentaires pour \u00e9tayer la plainte : 60 heures;\nSe pr\u00e9parer pour le contr\u00f4le judiciaire et pr\u00e9senter le contr\u00f4le judiciaire visant la d\u00e9cision de la Commission devant la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : 120 heures;\nTravailler avec un avocat pour l'appel devant la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : 60 heures;\nParticiper \u00e0 la seconde enqu\u00eate de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne : 40 heures;\nPrendre part \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal et se pr\u00e9parer pour l'audience : 200 heures.\n[235] Selon mes calculs, le total s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 480 heures, soit 12 semaines de travail \u00e0 40 heures de travail par semaine.\n[236] La GRC paiera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour le salaire \u00e0 temps plein et les avantages sociaux qu'il aurait re\u00e7us pendant deux ans \u00e0 compter de janvier 2000 (s'il s'agit bien de la date \u00e0 laquelle les cadets de la Troupe 4 ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme policiers de la GRC; sinon, on peut y substituer la bonne date). En plus, la GRC paiera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour le salaire et les avantages sociaux qu'il aurait re\u00e7us pour 480 autres heures de travail. Les montants doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 partir du salaire et des avantages sociaux qu'ont re\u00e7u en moyennne de 2000 \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 2007 les membres r\u00e9guliers dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s du D\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e0 la fin de 1999. M. Tahmourpour peut \u00eatre tenu de rembourser les prestations d'aide sociale qu'il a touch\u00e9es pendant ce temps.\n[237] Sauf pour la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle M. Tahmourpour ne pouvait travailler pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 et pour des raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte, j'estime que M. Tahmourpour aurait pu travailler jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 son argument voulant que le travail exig\u00e9 par sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne l'ait emp\u00each\u00e9 de travailler \u00e0 temps plein depuis le moment o\u00f9 il s'est senti suffisamment bien pour travailler jusqu'au d\u00e9but de l'audience, en ao\u00fbt 2007. Les gens prennent toutes sortes de mesures et de moyens pour exercer des activit\u00e9s importantes m\u00eame s'ils travaillent \u00e0 temps plein. M. Tahmourpour aurait pu faire de m\u00eame.\n[238] La GRC ne devrait payer que la diff\u00e9rence entre ce que M. Tahmourpour aurait gagn\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein et ce qu'il aurait gagn\u00e9 en tant que policier de la GRC, de la date \u00e0 laquelle s'est termin\u00e9e la p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce li\u00e9e aux questions de sant\u00e9 et au travail sur la plainte jusqu'\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Par cons\u00e9quent, la GRC doit payer la diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire moyen pour un travail \u00e0 temps plein dans l'industrie au Canada pour les personnes de l'\u00e2ge de M. Tahmourpour et le salaire qu'il aurait re\u00e7u en tant que policier de la GRC pour cette p\u00e9riode.\n[239] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. Tahmourpour aurait probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 promu caporal apr\u00e8s sept ans de travail comme agent. L'indemnit\u00e9 pay\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour doit tenir compte de ce changement de rang.\n[240] Les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les p\u00e9riodes pertinentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en preuve \u00e0 l'audience et d\u00e9pos\u00e9s comme pi\u00e8ce C-1, onglets 88 et 89. Ce sont les taux qui seront utilis\u00e9s dans le calcul de l'indemnit\u00e9, \u00e0 moins que les parties ne parviennent \u00e0 une autre entente.\n[241] La preuve sur la question de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires n'est pas claire. L'agent McCarney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les agents de service ordinaire sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s pour des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il ne savait pas exactement combien. Cela d\u00e9pendait du travail donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agent. J'estime que s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 de janvier 2000 jusqu'\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, M. Tahmourpour aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pour un certain nombre d'heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne qu'il soit pay\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour le montant moyen vers\u00e9 pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires aux agents dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s du D\u00e9p\u00f4t en 1999.\nFaut-il rendre une ordonnance pour les pertes de salaire futures?\n[242] Rien ne prouve que l'acte discriminatoire a endommag\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re permanente la capacit\u00e9 de travailler de M. Tahmourpour. Il est encore assez jeune, 35 ans, et a devant lui une vie professionnelle enti\u00e8re. M. Tahmourpour d\u00e9sire encore devenir agent de la GRC. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, s'il avait l'occasion de recommencer le programme de formation au D\u00e9p\u00f4t, il pourrait [traduction] le r\u00e9ussir haut la main.\n[243] Par cons\u00e9quent, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que M. Tahmourpour re\u00e7oive une offre lui permettant de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le programme de formation, il doit lui \u00eatre vers\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire moyen pour un travail \u00e0 temps plein dans l'industrie au Canada pour les personnes de l'\u00e2ge de M. Tahmourpour et le salaire qu'il aurait re\u00e7u en tant que policier de la GRC jusqu'\u00e0 la date de l'offre de formation.\n[244] D\u00e8s qu'elle offre \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour une place en formation, l'obligation de la GRC d'indemniser M. Tahmourpour pour la chance perdue de terminer la formation en 1999 s'\u00e9teint. Aucune autre indemnit\u00e9 ne doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9e \u00e0 ce titre.\n(ii) Pr\u00e9vention de la discrimination \u00e0 l'avenir - redressement syst\u00e9mique\n[245] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ordonner que la partie intim\u00e9e prenne des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables.\n[246] J'ai conclu que M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination syst\u00e9mique au D\u00e9p\u00f4t en 1999. De nombreux t\u00e9moins de la GRC ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage qu'ils croyaient que le D\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9tait un bien meilleur milieu de formation maintenant que des personnes comme le caporal Boyer avaient pris leur retraite. Le caporal Bradley a fait savoir que des changements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s au programme de formation depuis que M. Tahmourpour l'a suivi en 1999. Aujourd'hui, en plus de l'occasion qu'avait eue M. Tahmourpour de faire part de ses pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 ses instructeurs \u00e0 leurs sup\u00e9rieurs deux fois au cours du programme, la GRC v\u00e9rifie r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement les cours pour veiller \u00e0 ce que la qualit\u00e9 de l'enseignement et de l'\u00e9valuation demeure \u00e9lev\u00e9e.\n[247] M. Tahmourpour a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'un des individus dont il s'\u00e9tait plaint \u00e9tait justement le superviseur qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour entendre les pr\u00e9occupations des cadets deux fois pendant le programme. M. Tahmourpour ne se sentait pas \u00e0 l'aise pour faire part de ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 cette personne ou \u00e0 toute autre personne au D\u00e9p\u00f4t, parce qu'il craignait les repr\u00e9sailles.\n[248] Cette preuve et le rapport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la GRC en avril 2006, intitul\u00e9 \u00c9tude des syst\u00e8mes d'emploi (ESE) ne me convainquent pas que les changements mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus suffiront \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les actes discriminatoires comme ceux dont M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible. L'ESE est une \u00e9tude command\u00e9e par la GRC afin de d\u00e9terminer si la GRC respectait la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Dans l'ESE, les auteurs affirment que, bien que la formation sur la diversit\u00e9 fasse partie du Programme d'instruction des cadets, l'accent est mis sur le respect de la diversit\u00e9 dans le cadre du travail policier. La formation sur la diversit\u00e9 ne porte pas directement sur la diversit\u00e9 au D\u00e9p\u00f4t ou au sein de la GRC. Elle ne porte pas sur le respect de la diversit\u00e9 chez les employ\u00e9s de la GRC.\n[249] Les auteurs du rapport ont constat\u00e9 qu'un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s de la GRC appartenant \u00e0 un groupe d\u00e9sign\u00e9 ont l'impression que leurs coll\u00e8gues de la GRC n'acceptent pas ou ne respectent pas beaucoup leurs diff\u00e9rences culturelles. Les auteurs recommandent que soit mis sur pied un cours de formation \u00e0 la diversit\u00e9 normalis\u00e9 qui porterait sur la diversit\u00e9 interne au sein de la GRC.\n[250] Les auteurs de l'ESE ont soulev\u00e9 un autre probl\u00e8me \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre, soit le harc\u00e8lement que vivent particuli\u00e8rement les femmes et, dans une certaine mesure, les minorit\u00e9s visibles. La r\u00e9ponse aux plaintes ne semble g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas positive et les cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9coulant au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement si importantes que, dans certains cas, les gens ne portent pas plainte. Il y a de la m\u00e9fiance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du syst\u00e8me interne d'instruction des plaintes.\n[251] Le sergent Lise Lachance, l'officier en charge par int\u00e9rim de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par la GRC relativement \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement \u00e9tait en cours de r\u00e9vision et que la GRC faisait des efforts pour combattre la discrimination dans ses rangs. Cependant, le sergent Lachance ne savait pas si ces efforts s'\u00e9tendaient \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole de la GRC, le D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n[252] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette preuve, je conclus que la GRC doit prendre des mesures pour \u00e9viter que ne se reproduisent des actes discriminatoires comme ceux dont a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime M. Tahmourpour. Les mesures doivent porter sur les aspects \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ci-dessous. Cependant, je crois qu'il vaut mieux accorder aux parties trois mois \u00e0 partir de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision pour s'entendre sur la nature exacte des mesures \u00e0 prendre ainsi que sur le calendrier de leur mise en uvre. Je demeure saisie de cette partie de l'affaire au cas o\u00f9 les parties seraient incapables de s'entendre d'ici trois mois. \u00c0 ce moment, je rendrai une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive quant aux mesures appropri\u00e9es que doit prendre la GRC.\n[253] Les mesures visant \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir la discrimination doivent comprendre les suivantes :\nUne politique et un ensemble de proc\u00e9dures visant \u00e0 mettre fin au harc\u00e8lement et \u00e0 la discrimination au D\u00e9p\u00f4t et permettant aux cadets de faire part imm\u00e9diatement de leurs pr\u00e9occupations, sans crainte de repr\u00e9sailles ou de cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives, \u00e0 quelqu'un ayant le pouvoir d'apporter des changements. Une copie de la politique et des proc\u00e9dures sera remise \u00e0 chaque cadet dans sa trousse de bienvenue, d\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Un programme de formation sur la diversit\u00e9 et la sensibilisation aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles que suivront les cadets ainsi que tous les membres du personnel du D\u00e9p\u00f4t, laquelle formation visera \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper et favoriser une culture de respect et de tol\u00e9rance de la diversit\u00e9 au sein de la GRC. Les questions soulev\u00e9es aux pages 59 \u00e0 64 du Rapport 3 suivant un sondage men\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s des membres r\u00e9guliers, datant de septembre 1996, doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre prises en compte, de m\u00eame que tout autre document pertinent. Les suggestions concernant une formation sur la diversit\u00e9 formul\u00e9es dans l'\u00c9tude des syst\u00e8mes d'emploi effectu\u00e9e par Lakshmi Ram and Associates (avril 2006) doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre prises en compte, particuli\u00e8rement pour ce qui est de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une formation portant sur la diversit\u00e9 au sein de la GRC. Un comit\u00e9 consultatif ou un officier responsable du multiculturalisme au D\u00e9p\u00f4t qui formule des recommandations au commandant du D\u00e9p\u00f4t au sujet de la pr\u00e9vention de la discrimination et de la promotion du respect et de la tol\u00e9rance envers la diversit\u00e9 au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Le commandant devrait toujours r\u00e9pondre par \u00e9crit \u00e0 ces recommandations et justifier tout rejet d'une recommandation.\n(iii) Pr\u00e9judice moral\n[254] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e d'indemniser jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a subi un pr\u00e9judice moral. M. Tahmourpour a demand\u00e9 l'indemnit\u00e9 maximale. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9 par le traitement discriminatoire dont il a fait l'objet. Cela l'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 souffrir d'insomnies et de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 se concentrer. Cependant, il a parfois mentionn\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il \u00e9tait seulement [traduction] boulevers\u00e9 quand il a quitt\u00e9 le D\u00e9p\u00f4t, et non pas d\u00e9prim\u00e9 ou incapable de fonctionner. En outre, M. Tahmourpour n'a pas toujours pris les m\u00e9dicaments qui auraient att\u00e9nu\u00e9 ses souffrances.\n[255] J'estime que, bien que M. Tahmourpour ait subi un certain pr\u00e9judice moral du fait de la conduite discriminatoire, la dur\u00e9e et l'intensit\u00e9 de ce pr\u00e9judice ne justifient pas une indemnit\u00e9 de 20 000 $. Compte tenu des circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Tahmourpour recevra 9 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'il a subi.\nIndemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale - paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi\n[256] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi dispose que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de payer une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte discriminatoire \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[257] Je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que le caporal Boyer a agi de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e quand il a formul\u00e9 des remarques discriminatoires et s'est montr\u00e9 verbalement violent \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Tahmourpour. Je conclus \u00e9galement que son initiative visant \u00e0 faire r\u00e9silier le contrat de M. Tahmourpour pour des motifs discriminatoires \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Le caporal Jacques et le caporal Bradley ont coop\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'initiative visant \u00e0 faire renvoyer M. Tahmourpour en fournissant des \u00e9valuations qui \u00e9taient inexactes et injustes.\n[258] Avant la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat, M. Tahmourpour a envoy\u00e9 une lettre de r\u00e9futation \u00e0 l'officier en charge de la formation \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 chaque point soulev\u00e9 par le caporal Bradley et le caporal Jacques dans leur demande de r\u00e9siliation et il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire. La GRC n'a ni fait enqu\u00eate ni r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 sa plainte de discrimination jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle soit tenue de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la plainte formelle que M. Tahmourpour a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[259] Le sergent H\u00e9bert, et c'est tout \u00e0 son honneur, a demand\u00e9 pardon \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour pour les remarques discriminatoires qu'il a prononc\u00e9es au sujet de son pendentif religieux. La conduite du sergent H\u00e9bert est d'autant plus remarquable dans un contexte o\u00f9 les autres officiers agissent de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire sans \u00e9gard aucun aux cons\u00e9quences.\n[260] J'estime par cons\u00e9quent qu'il convient d'ordonner \u00e0 la GRC de payer \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour 12 000 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale.\nD\u00e9penses\n[261] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'indemniser la victime des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire.\n[262] M. Tahmourpour a engag\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses de 9 500 $ pour payer les cours de la chambre immobili\u00e8re et d'interpr\u00e9tation. Il a avanc\u00e9 que ces d\u00e9penses, engag\u00e9es dans le cadre de ses efforts visant \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer ses pertes, devraient lui \u00eatre rembours\u00e9es par la GRC. J'ai conclu que les efforts de M. Tahmourpour pour att\u00e9nuer ses pertes pouvaient au mieux \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s de ti\u00e8des. N\u00e9anmoins, M. Tahmourpour a bel et bien engag\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses qui n'auraient peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaires si on lui avait permis de terminer sa formation et de gagner sa vie comme agent de la GRC. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 la GRC de rembourser \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour le co\u00fbt des cours de la chambre immobili\u00e8re et de traduction.\n[263] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 encore une fois le pouvoir du Tribunal d'adjuger des d\u00e9pens raisonnables : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mowat, 2008 CF 118, au paragraphe 40. Voir \u00e9galement Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Thwaites, [1994] 3 C.F. 38, au paragraphe 56; Stevenson c. Canada (Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9), 2003 CFPI 341, aux paragraphes 23 \u00e0 26; et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Brooks, 2006 CF 500.\n[264] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 la GRC de payer \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour des d\u00e9pens raisonnables \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire. M. Tahmourpour n'a pas produit de preuve sur la question des frais juridiques. En cons\u00e9quence, je ne suis pas en mesure de rendre une ordonnance quant au montant des d\u00e9pens. Cependant, j'encourage les parties \u00e0 s'entendre sur le montant des d\u00e9pens raisonnables en l'esp\u00e8ce. Je demeure saisie de cet aspect de l'affaire au cas o\u00f9 les parties seraient incapables de s'entendre. Si aucune entente n'est conclue, les parties doivent en aviser le Tribunal dans les trois mois suivant la r\u00e9ception de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nInt\u00e9r\u00eats\n[265] En vertu du paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi, des int\u00e9r\u00eats sont payables sur les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d'escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle), conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur la perte de salaire commencent \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir de la date \u00e0 laquelle M. Tahmourpour aurait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la GRC et seront calcul\u00e9s en fonction du moment o\u00f9 le salaire aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 payable \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour.\n[266] Quant \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral et \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 vers\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 53(3), les int\u00e9r\u00eats commencent \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir de la date de la plainte. Cependant, en aucun cas le montant total payable en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), y compris les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne doit exc\u00e9der 20 000 $. De m\u00eame, le montant total payable en vertu du paragraphe 53(3), y compris les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne doit pas d\u00e9passer 20 000 $.\nVII. ORDONNANCE [267] En vertu du pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi, le Tribunal ordonne ce qui suit :\nsauf entente contraire, l'intim\u00e9e offrira \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour la chance de s'inscrire au prochain Programme d'instruction des cadets de la GRC au D\u00e9p\u00f4t; si M. Tahmourpour accepte l'offre de r\u00e9admission, l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9valuera \u00e9quitablement ses habilet\u00e9s d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du programme de formation dans le but de d\u00e9terminer les domaines dans lesquels il a besoin de formation; l'intim\u00e9e versera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour une indemnit\u00e9 pour le salaire et les avantages sociaux qu'il aurait touch\u00e9s durant les premiers deux ans et douze semaines de travail en tant que policier de la GRC apr\u00e8s l'obtention du dipl\u00f4me au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. L'indemnit\u00e9 sera diminu\u00e9e de 8 %; l'intim\u00e9e paiera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour la diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire moyen pour un travail \u00e0 temps plein dans l'industrie au Canada pour les personnes de l'\u00e2ge de M. Tahmourpour et le salaire qu'il aurait touch\u00e9 en tant que policier de la GRC jusqu'\u00e0 ce que M. Tahmourpour accepte ou rejette l'offre de r\u00e9admission au programme de formation au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. L'intim\u00e9e versera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour le montant moyen pay\u00e9 pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires aux autres agents dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s du D\u00e9p\u00f4t en 1999, sauf entente contraire entre les parties. L'indemnit\u00e9 sera diminu\u00e9e de 8 %; l'indemnit\u00e9 doit tenir compte d'une promotion au rang de caporal apr\u00e8s 7 ans; les parties tenteront de s'entendre sur les mesures \u00e0 prendre et le calendrier de mise en uvre relativement aux questions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans la section redressement syst\u00e9mique de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Si les parties sont incapables de s'entendre sur cette partie de l'adjudication dans les trois mois suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal rendra une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive; l'intim\u00e9e versera 9 000 $ \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral caus\u00e9 par les actes discriminatoires; l'intim\u00e9e versera 12 000 $ \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi; l'intim\u00e9e versera 9 500 $ \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses qu'il a engag\u00e9es pour att\u00e9nuer ses pertes. L'intim\u00e9e indemnisera \u00e9galement M. Tahmourpour pour les frais juridiques engag\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce; l'intim\u00e9e paiera les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce, conform\u00e9ment aux modalit\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9es.\nKaren A.

INTRODUCTION [1] Il s'agissait d'une p\u00e9riode extr\u00eamement occup\u00e9e et stressante. C'\u00e9tait en 2002 et on s'empressait d'achever le Terminal 1 de l'A\u00e9roport international Pearson de Toronto. Les employ\u00e9s du D\u00e9partement de la technologie de l'information de l'intim\u00e9e, l'Autorit\u00e9 a\u00e9roportuaire du Grand Toronto (la GTAA) suivaient un horaire serr\u00e9 pour le lancement du syst\u00e8me informatique op\u00e9rationnel du nouveau Terminal 1. C'est dans ce contexte que la plaignante, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Fahmy, s'est retrouv\u00e9e lorsqu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme analyste de r\u00e9seau dans le secteur de l'exploitation des syst\u00e8mes de la TI de la GTAA en juillet 2002.\n[2] Au d\u00e9but, tout semblait bien aller pour Mme Fahmy. Cependant, avec le temps, de son point de vue et de celui de son employeur, des probl\u00e8mes ont surgi. Cela a commenc\u00e9 avec l'arriv\u00e9e de son nouveau gestionnaire, quelques semaines apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 la GTAA. La relation s'est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e. Du point de vue de l'employeur, son rendement au travail n'\u00e9tait tout simplement pas constant. Cependant, comme son rendement s'\u00e9tait am\u00e9lior\u00e9 depuis la premi\u00e8re \u00e9valuation de rendement, sa p\u00e9riode probatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e. Le 1er mai 2003 - dix mois apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut commenc\u00e9 son emploi - la GTAA l'a cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief dans lequel elle all\u00e9guait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9 et, s'appuyant sur l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H 6, modifi\u00e9e (la LCDP), elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) dans laquelle elle all\u00e9guait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs de distinction illicite de la race, de l'origine nationale ou ethnique, de la couleur et du sexe.\nII. LE CONTEXTE [3] La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2005. Les parties ont estim\u00e9 que l'audience durerait dix jours. La Commission n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Lors du premier jour d'audience, l'avocate de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve soit scind\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9e a accept\u00e9. L'avocate de la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle avait r\u00e9cemment repris le dossier des mains d'un autre avocat, et qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable d'obtenir des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 temps pour la partie de l'audience portant sur les mesures de redressement. L'avocate a aussi mentionn\u00e9 que la plaignante souffrait d'un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 mentale, que sa cliente ne souhaitait pas r\u00e9v\u00e9ler \u00e0 moins que ce soit n\u00e9cessaire. Ces questions n'\u00e9taient pas pertinentes quant \u00e0 la partie de l'audience portant sur la responsabilit\u00e9. Comme je doutais que l'audience compl\u00e8te p\u00fbt se terminer dans les dix jours pr\u00e9vus de toute fa\u00e7on, j'ai accept\u00e9 \u00e0 contrecur de scinder la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve.\n[4] Malheureusement, mes soup\u00e7ons se sont confirm\u00e9s. L'audience a dur\u00e9 vingt et un jours et demi, y compris la requ\u00eate en non lieu. M\u00eame si les avocates des parties avaient sous estim\u00e9 le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour l'audience, pour \u00eatre justes envers elles, je dois dire qu'il y avait d'autres facteurs en jeu. Le t\u00e9moignage de certains t\u00e9moins a dur\u00e9 anormalement longtemps. Par exemple, le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante a occup\u00e9 presque huit jours de l'audience. Les questions devaient \u00eatre r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, parce que la plaignante ne r\u00e9pondait tout simplement pas directement \u00e0 la question. Beaucoup d'objections ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es pendant l'audience, principalement par l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e. Je tiens \u00e0 ajouter que j'ai fait droit \u00e0 une grande partie de ses objections.\n[5] En plus de la dur\u00e9e de l'audience, j'\u00e9tais pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la longueur de la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les s\u00e9ances s'\u00e9taient d\u00e9roul\u00e9es - exactement un an. Ce d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 l'horaire charg\u00e9 des avocates. Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s difficile de trouver des p\u00e9riodes au cours desquelles les deux avocates \u00e9taient disponibles. Je mentionne ce fait parce que cinq ans se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis que l'emploi de Mme Fahmy aupr\u00e8s de la GTAA s'est termin\u00e9. La Commission a pris deux ans et demi pour renvoyer l'affaire au Tribunal et l'audience m\u00eame s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e sur un an. Il n'est \u00e9videmment pas dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'une ou l'autre partie (ou de la Commission, qui n'a pas particip\u00e9) que l'affaire prenne autant de temps avant d'en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion. Pour les parties et pour les t\u00e9moins, les souvenirs s'effacent et il devient plus difficile de t\u00e9moigner. Pour le Tribunal, il devient encore plus difficile de trancher. Cependant, je suis convaincu que la preuve de vive voix ainsi que la preuve documentaire \u00e9taient suffisamment convaincantes pour me permettre de tirer des conclusions de fait et de droit et de trancher l'affaire.\nIII. L'UTILISATION DES INITIALES [6] On verra dans mes motifs que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 assez dur au sujet de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante et de certains t\u00e9moins, ainsi que de leurs t\u00e9moignages respectifs. Ainsi, et vu les lourdes accusations de la plaignante envers son gestionnaire en particulier et envers d'autres t\u00e9moins, et celles d'autres t\u00e9moins les uns envers les autres, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'utiliser des initiales pour certains des t\u00e9moins, afin de prot\u00e9ger leurs renseignements personnels et leur r\u00e9putation. Je n'ai pas utilis\u00e9 d'initiales pour les parties.\nIV. LA PLAINTE [7] Mme Fahmy soutient que la GTAA a viol\u00e9 ses droits, que les alin\u00e9as 7a) et 7b) de la LCDP prot\u00e8gent. L'article 7 pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na)de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu;\nb)de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\nMme Fahmy soutient qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs de la race, de l'origine nationale ou ethnique, de la couleur et du sexe. Elle est une femme de couleur d'origine \u00e9gyptienne.\n[8] La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte le 14 juin 2003. Elle l'a reformul\u00e9e plusieurs fois. En fait, la Commission a d'abord refus\u00e9 de traiter sa plainte. Je dois ajouter que cela n'a aucune incidence sur ma d\u00e9cision, parce que l'audience devant le Tribunal est une audience de novo. Dans mes motifs, je traite des all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9cises.\n[9] L'essentiel de la plainte de Mme Fahmy (fond\u00e9e sur le formulaire de plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9, l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal (qui s'apparente \u00e0 une plaidoirie) et son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix) vise son gestionnaire, S.M., qui est devenu son gestionnaire quelques semaines apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 la GTAA. Le pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur de S.M. l'avait embauch\u00e9e. Dans son formulaire de plainte, elle mentionne aussi que A.W., gestionnaire de projet de l'exploitation, qui l'avait supervis\u00e9e de janvier \u00e0 avril 2003 [TRADUCTION] [...] a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9truire mon estime personnelle, m\u00eame si elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s gentil avec elle. Cependant, sa plainte est surtout dirig\u00e9e contre S.M. Il n'est pas une partie \u00e0 la plainte; la GTAA est la seule intim\u00e9e. Dans sa lettre au pr\u00e9sident et PDG de la GTAA, Louis Turpen, dat\u00e9e du 4 mai 2003, apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, elle d\u00e9clarait qu'elle ne bl\u00e2mait pas la GTAA, elle bl\u00e2mait seulement S.M. pour avoir agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle. Elle a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] [...] il ne m'aimait pas \u00e0 cause de mes origines. Elle n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. De plus, dans une lettre \u00e0 la Commission qui portait un tampon dateur du 11 d\u00e9cembre 2003, Mme Fahmy a \u00e9crit [TRADUCTION] Je crois fortement que ma plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne porte sur le fait qu'on a donn\u00e9 mon travail \u00e0 des Blancs. Il n'y a aucune mention de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Elle soutient seulement plus tard qu'il y a eu discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. De plus, \u00e0 l'audience, Mme Fahmy a soutenu que A.W. avait, en secret, attribu\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches techniques aux [TRADUCTION] entrepreneurs blancs - ne mentionnant rien au sujet d'une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[10] En d\u00e9pit du fait que S.M. n'est pas une partie au litige, la GTAA peut bien entendu \u00eatre tenue responsable (de fa\u00e7on analogue \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'employeur en droit de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle) pour tout acte discriminatoire que S.M. (ou tout autre gestionnaire, employ\u00e9, entrepreneur\/consultant \u00e0 titre d'agent de la GTAA) aurait commis en cours d'emploi, au sens de l'article 65 de la LCDP. C'est le cas \u00e0 moins que l'employeur intim\u00e9 puisse d\u00e9montrer qu'il n'a pas consenti \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire, qu'il a agi avec diligence raisonnable de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir l'acte et qu'il en a att\u00e9nu\u00e9 l'effet.\n[11] Dans son formulaire de plainte, Mme Fahmy soutient que son emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 des [TRADUCTION] entrepreneurs blancs moins qualifi\u00e9s. Elle soutient aussi que son gestionnaire blanc, S.M. pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait les [TRADUCTION] Blancs aux personnes de couleur [TRADUCTION] qui ont des accents. Elle a \u00e9crit qu'il avait pass\u00e9 des commentaires sexistes devant elle. De plus, Mme Fahmy soutient que S.M. lui a donn\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation de rendement injuste [TRADUCTION] remplie de fausses accusations. Elle fait valoir qu'elle a port\u00e9 plainte \u00e0 Maria Maack, la gestionnaire des ressources humaines, au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont S.M. la traitait, sans r\u00e9sultat. Elle aussi \u00e9crit [TRADUCTION] [S.M.] m'\u00e9vitait et refusait de reconna\u00eetre mon bon rendement. [Soulign\u00e9 par la plaignante.]\nV. LA REQU\u00caTE EN NON-LIEU A. La question du choix [12] Lorsque la plaignante eut termin\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter son dossier, l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle souhaitait pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en non lieu. J'ai re\u00e7u des observations \u00e9crites au sujet de la question de savoir si la GTAA devrait choisir de ne pas appeler de t\u00e9moins, si la requ\u00eate \u00e9tait entendue. J'ai conclu que la GTAA n'aurait pas \u00e0 faire de choix.\n[13] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question du choix, j'ai quelques commentaires \u00e0 formuler. Premi\u00e8rement, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9cider si un choix est requis et s'il entendra une requ\u00eate en non lieu : Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 CF 785. Le juge Hughes a not\u00e9 au paragraphe 22 que la question de l'exigence du choix est une question de proc\u00e9dure, et n'est pas une question de droit ou de justice naturelle : Il y a lieu d'accorder une latitude suffisante aux tribunaux administratifs en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure [...]. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le Tribunal a lui-m\u00eame rendu, apr\u00e8s m\u00fbre r\u00e9flexion, des d\u00e9cisions tant \u00e0 l'appui de l'exigence de faire un choix qu'\u00e0 l'appui de ne pas exiger que l'intim\u00e9 fasse un choix avant que le Tribunal entende une requ\u00eate en non lieu. Dans les deux d\u00e9cisions, les membres respectifs du Tribunal ont accept\u00e9 que la question devait \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e en fonction des circonstances de chaque dossier : Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien \u00eatre social), [1999] D.C.D.P. no 5, et Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 TCDP 30. Dans le contexte civil, la plupart des juridictions au Canada n'exigent pas de choix . Bien qu'il existe des raisons l\u00e9gales et politiques valables pour l'une et l'autre d\u00e9cision, je suis plut\u00f4t persuad\u00e9 par des arguments en faveur de la d\u00e9marche n'exigeant pas de choix1. Dans le contexte de la LCDP, il n'y a aucun interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable pour les parties. Il n'y a aucune requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire2. En fait, la LCDP ne pr\u00e9voit aucune adjudication des d\u00e9pens en faveur de l'intim\u00e9 qui obtient gain de cause dans une proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal. Un intim\u00e9 devant faire face \u00e0 une plainte frivole ou vexatoire n'a que [TRADUCTION] peu de chances d'obtenir une d\u00e9cision sommaire qui ne n\u00e9cessite pas une audience en bonne et due forme devant le Tribunal, apr\u00e8s que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte devant le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne crois pas qu'il soit juste d'exiger que l'intim\u00e9e fasse le choix de ne pas appeler de t\u00e9moins \u00e0 titre de condition \u00e0 l'examen de sa requ\u00eate en non lieu. Aucune preuve ne m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e donnant \u00e0 entendre que le fait de ne pas demander qu'un choix soit fait augmente le nombre de requ\u00eates en non lieu pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es et qui prolonge le processus d'audience.\nB. D\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate en non lieu [14] Le 3 juillet 2007, j'ai entendu les arguments au sujet de la requ\u00eate en non lieu. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, j'ai avis\u00e9 les parties de l'ordonnance suivante :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa requ\u00eate en non lieu est rejet\u00e9e. Je suis convaincu qu'il existe des preuves qui, si on leur pr\u00eate foi, pourraient entra\u00eener une responsabilit\u00e9 au sens de la LCDP. Cela ne veut pas dire que la preuve sera crue et qu'une responsabilit\u00e9 sera \u00e9tablie \u00e0 la fin de l'audience, que la GTAA choisisse d'appeler des t\u00e9moins ou non. De toute fa\u00e7on (c'est \u00e0 dire si la GTAA choisit d'appeler des t\u00e9moins ou non), \u00e0 la fin de l'audience, je proc\u00e9derai \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation et \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation habituelles de la preuve, y compris la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, ce que je ne peux pas faire dans une requ\u00eate en non lieu.\n[14] Dans les circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce, o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9e a pu pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en non lieu sans avoir \u00e0 choisir de ne pas appeler de t\u00e9moins, je crois qu'il serait inappropri\u00e9 de rendre des motifs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement. Par cons\u00e9quent, je rendrai mes motifs de d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la fin de l'audience.\n[15] On verra dans mon ordonnance ci dessus que, pour l'essentiel, je n'ai rendu aucun motif, j'ai plut\u00f4t promis de rendre des motifs complets \u00e0 la fin de l'audience. J'ai ainsi r\u00e9pondu aux commentaires qui ont paru dans diverses d\u00e9cisions portant sur le choix et les requ\u00eates en non lieu \u00e0 savoir s'il fallait rendre des motifs, \u00e0 quel moment ils devaient \u00eatre rendus et quelle port\u00e9e ils devaient avoir, lorsqu'un choix n'est pas exig\u00e9. \u00c9videmment, il ne s'agit pas de d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 la requ\u00eate en non lieu est accueillie, ou o\u00f9 un choix est exig\u00e9. L'arbitre Slotnick dans Potocnik c. Thunder Bay (City), [1996] O.H.R.B.I.D. no 16, au paragraphe 16, souscrit \u00e0 l'approche suivie dans Tomen c. O.T.F. (no 3), (1989) 11 C.H.R.R. D\/223, justifiant le fait de ne pas rendre de motifs. Au paragraphe 10, l'arbitre Slotnick d\u00e9clare :\n[TRADUCTION]\n[...] lorsqu'un arbitre n'exige pas qu'un choix soit fait et qu'il rejette la requ\u00eate visant le rejet de la plainte, la proc\u00e9dure appropri\u00e9e \u00e0 suivre est de ne pas rendre de motifs. Autrement, la partie qui va pr\u00e9senter sa preuve aurait l'avantage de conna\u00eetre les pens\u00e9es de l'arbitre au sujet de la preuve de l'autre partie.\nDans Filgueira, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le membre Groarke a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait qu'un intim\u00e9 pourrait sonder le terrain aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal. Je conviens que l'intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas tirer avantage du fait qu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en non lieu qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bout\u00e9e et qui lui permettrait de prendre le pouls du Tribunal. L'arbitre ne devrait pas rendre de motifs et devrait seulement dire si une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. C'est l'approche que j'ai suivie en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nC. Le droit au sujet des requ\u00eates en non lieu [16] La requ\u00eate en non lieu porte parfois le nom de requ\u00eate en irrecevabilit\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence et son existence est justifi\u00e9e. Dans un processus accusatoire, un d\u00e9fendeur n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une preuve. Le fardeau de la preuve revient \u00e0 celui qui am\u00e8ne l'affaire en justice - le plaignant. On ne devrait pas s'attendre \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9fendeur aide le plaignant \u00e0 faire sa preuve. De plus, si le plaignant est incapable de pr\u00e9senter une preuve suffisante (ou n'est pas capable d'en pr\u00e9senter une) pour \u00e9tablir en fait et en droit qu'il devrait y avoir responsabilit\u00e9, le d\u00e9fendeur ne devrait pas \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve, \u00e0 grands frais pour les parties et pour le public, qui finance les tribunaux.\n[17] S'il est vrai que les ressources du d\u00e9fendeur et les fonds publics ne devraient pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour payer une d\u00e9fense contre des questions frivoles ou vexatoires, les tribunaux ont n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9tabli des exigences \u00e9lev\u00e9es pour l'accueil des requ\u00eates en non lieu. Cela est effectu\u00e9 de diverses fa\u00e7ons : le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie, qui exige une pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle la preuve du plaignant peut \u00eatre crue, en donnant pour l'essentiel le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute au plaignant; l'obligation que le d\u00e9fendeur fasse un choix (dans les juridictions qui l'exigent); l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens contre une partie requ\u00e9rante d\u00e9bout\u00e9e. Les cours ont clairement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il ne devrait pas \u00eatre trop facile pour un d\u00e9fendeur de repousser une poursuite en pr\u00e9sentant une requ\u00eate en non lieu. Il existe peut \u00eatre une crainte de retard du processus si les requ\u00eates en non lieu d\u00e9bout\u00e9es devenaient la norme. D'autre part, comme l'arbitre Wildsmith l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Gerin c. IMP Group Ltd., [1994] N.S.H.R.B.I.D. no 4, au paragraphe 21 : [TRADUCTION] [...] Je note que la requ\u00eate en non lieu peut \u00eatre une mesure de protection contre l'abus.\nD. La preuve prima facie dans les requ\u00eates en non lieu [18] Les tribunaux ont tranch\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment au cours des ann\u00e9es au sujet du crit\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer aux requ\u00eates en non lieu. Par exemple, le plaignant doit il pr\u00e9senter une preuve suffisante ou doit il simplement pr\u00e9senter une preuve au sujet des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du dossier pour qu\u00edl y ait rejet d'une requ\u00eate en non lieu? Y a t il une diff\u00e9rence dans le contexte p\u00e9nal par rapport au contexte civil?\n[19] Du point de vue civil, dont rel\u00e8ve l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce, le crit\u00e8re pour la partie requ\u00e9rante est le suivant : Y a t il eu une preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qui, si on lui pr\u00eate foi, peut entra\u00eener une responsabilit\u00e9, en l'absence d'une r\u00e9ponse du d\u00e9fendeur (ou de l'intim\u00e9 dans le contexte de la LCDP)? En d'autres mots, la preuve exige-t-elle du d\u00e9fendeur une r\u00e9ponse? Dans l'affirmative, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e; dans la n\u00e9gative, la requ\u00eate est accueillie. Une requ\u00eate en non lieu d\u00e9bout\u00e9e ne signifie pas que la plaignante aura gain de cause \u00e0 l'issue de l'audience. Cela signifie simplement qu'on n'a pas satisfait aux exigences \u00e9lev\u00e9es permettant le rejet pr\u00e9liminaire du dossier.\n[20] Il est important de noter que les approches analytiques utilis\u00e9es dans des d\u00e9cisions sur le non lieu et dans les d\u00e9cisions sur le bien fond\u00e9 sont diff\u00e9rentes. Comme le membre Groarke l'a not\u00e9 dans une autre d\u00e9cision, soit Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 TCDP 32, au paragraphe 12, dans une requ\u00eate en non lieu, on a recours \u00e0 un type d'analyse diff\u00e9rent de celui utilis\u00e9 pour juger du bien fond\u00e9 \u00e0 l'issue de l'audience. Les tribunaux ont clairement \u00e9tabli qu'un juge des faits ou un arbitre ne doit pas avoir recours \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation et \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation habituelles de la preuve, y compris la question de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, qui sont effectu\u00e9es habituellement \u00e0 l'issue d'un proc\u00e8s ou d'une audience. Il s'agit d'une erreur de droit de confondre les deux processus. Dans une requ\u00eate en non lieu, le juge des faits examine l'affaire du point de vue de la preuve prima facie - de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s superficielle, [TRADUCTION] \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, comme le terme latin prima facie signifie litt\u00e9ralement. Aucun examen attentif de la preuve ni aucune \u00e9valuation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins ne sont effectu\u00e9s. Comme l'arbitre Wildsmith l'a correctement not\u00e9 dans Gerin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 7 : [TRADUCTION] [...] la qualit\u00e9 de la preuve ne doit pas \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment. De plus, comme l'arbitre Baum l'a \u00e9crit dans Tomen, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 29 : [TRADUCTION] Je dois examiner la preuve \u00e0 travers un prisme \u00e9troit. Comme tel, je n'\u00e9value pas la preuve contradictoire. J'ajoute que cela comprend la preuve contradictoire provenant du dossier m\u00eame du plaignant, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne soit simplement invraisemblable. Dans le cas d'une requ\u00eate en non lieu, il y a presque une pr\u00e9somption de v\u00e9racit\u00e9 au sujet de la preuve - si l'on y pr\u00eate foi. Le plaignant obtient le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute. En effet, l'exigence est si \u00e9lev\u00e9e que ce n'est que si le dossier du plaignant est tellement invraisemblable ou tir\u00e9 par les cheveux (c'est \u00e0 dire que le d\u00e9cideur ne devrait pas tenir compte de ses propres croyances pour l'accepter) qu'on ne devrait pas y pr\u00eater foi3 . Par cons\u00e9quent, il est difficile pour la partie requ\u00e9rante d'obtenir gain de cause dans une requ\u00eate en non lieu. De plus, si la cour ou le tribunal demande \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante de faire un choix, compte tenu de l'exigence \u00e9lev\u00e9e \u00e9tablie, tr\u00e8s peu d'avocats de d\u00e9fendeurs ou d'intim\u00e9s prendraient ce risque.\n[21] Le r\u00f4le du juge des faits dans une requ\u00eate en non lieu a r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 par la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario dans FL Receivables Trust 2002 A (Administrator of) c. Cobrand Foods Ltd. (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 561. La Cour d'appel de l'Ontario a conclu que le juge des faits avait appliqu\u00e9 le mauvais crit\u00e8re lorsqu'il a accueilli la requ\u00eate en non lieu [TRADUCTION] [...] en outrepassant son mandat limit\u00e9 [...] dans la requ\u00eate en non lieu. Le juge Laskin a \u00e9crit aux paragraphes 35 et 36 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nDans une requ\u00eate en non lieu, le juge des faits effectue un examen limit\u00e9. Les deux principes pertinents qui guident cet examen sont les suivants. Premi\u00e8rement si un plaignant pr\u00e9sente une preuve au sujet de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de sa plainte, le juge doit rejeter la requ\u00eate. Deuxi\u00e8mement, lorsqu'il examine si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, le juge doit pr\u00e9sumer que la preuve est v\u00e9ridique et doit attribuer la signification la plus favorable \u00e0 la preuve qui pourrait entra\u00eener des conclusions contradictoires [...]\nEn d'autres mots, dans une requ\u00eate en non lieu, le juge des faits ne doit pas \u00e9tablir si les conclusions contradictoires dans la preuve sur lesquelles le d\u00e9fendeur peut se fonder r\u00e9futent la preuve prima facie du plaignant. Le juge des faits doit tirer cette conclusion \u00e0 la fin du proc\u00e8s, et non pendant une requ\u00eate en non lieu. Voir John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman et Alan W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2e \u00e9dition (Toronto : Butterworths Canada, 1999), \u00e0 la page 139.\nJe suppose que la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario ne donnait pas \u00e0 entendre que la pr\u00e9somption de v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de la preuve comprend une preuve qui est extr\u00eamement invraisemblable ou simplement ridicule.\n[22] Je souhaite aussi noter qu'il y a une certaine confusion dans la jurisprudence au sujet de ce qu'exige le crit\u00e8re : est-ce que la preuve pourrait entra\u00eener une responsabilit\u00e9 ou est-ce qu'elle entra\u00eene cette responsabilit\u00e9. Les tribunaux ont suivi les deux approches et certains tribunaux \u00e9vitent la question compl\u00e8tement. Dans Filgueira, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le juge Hughes souscrit, au paragraphe 6, au passage suivant de Sopinka, Lederman et Bryant : [TRADUCTION] Le juge doit d\u00e9terminer si l'arbitre des faits pourrait raisonnablement donner gain de cause au demandeur s'il croyait la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0 dans le proc\u00e8s. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.] Il est clair que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a adopt\u00e9 l'approche du pourrait, du moins dans les contextes du droit civil et du droit p\u00e9nal, que j'ai suivie en l'esp\u00e8ce4 . Je ne vois aucune raison de d\u00e9vier de cette approche dans l'affaire dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[23] Y a t il un fardeau de pr\u00e9sentation diff\u00e9rent pour l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination dans le cas d'une requ\u00eate en non lieu par rapport aux autres situations, dans le d\u00e9roulement normal d'une audience, apr\u00e8s que les deux parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs preuves? On ne m'a pas pos\u00e9 cette question en l'esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'examinerai la question une autre fois.\nE. Les all\u00e9gations et les faits dont il est question dans la requ\u00eate en non lieu [24] J'appliquerai maintenant le droit en mati\u00e8re de requ\u00eate en non lieu aux all\u00e9gations et aux faits en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce. La GTAA soutient qu'il n'y a pas de preuve, qui, si on lui pr\u00eate foi, peut appuyer une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 contre elle pour discrimination au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7a) ou 7b) de la LCDP et qui porte sur l'un des motifs de discrimination illicite cit\u00e9s par la plaignante. La plaignante soutient le contraire.\n[25] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 attentivement la preuve, tant de vive voix que documentaire, de la plaignante et de ses t\u00e9moins, comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 dans mon ordonnance, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu qu'il existait une preuve qui, si on y pr\u00eatait foi, pourrait entra\u00eener une responsabilit\u00e9. Pour l'objet de la requ\u00eate en non lieu, je n'ai pas besoin d'aborder chaque all\u00e9gation. La preuve prima facie n'a qu'\u00e0 \u00eatre \u00e9tablie sur une seule violation de l'article 7, pour chacun des motifs de discrimination illicite cit\u00e9s, pour que la requ\u00eate soit rejet\u00e9e. Je reconnais que certaines des all\u00e9gations portent sur le motif de distinction illicite du sexe et d'autres, sur les motifs de la race, de l'origine nationale ou ethnique et de la couleur. Certaines des all\u00e9gations portent aussi sur tous les motifs de distinction illicites cit\u00e9s, parce qu'il est souvent difficile d'analyser les caract\u00e9ristiques immuables d'une personne lorsque l'on conclut qu'il y a eu des pratiques discriminatoires.\n[26] Pour effectuer cette analyse de la requ\u00eate en non lieu, j'ai suivi les param\u00e8tres juridiques suivants : donner le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute \u00e0 la plaignante, donner la meilleure interpr\u00e9tation possible \u00e0 la preuve de la plaignante et de ses t\u00e9moins et ne pas tenir compte des questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[27] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 pour violation de l'article 7 fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, pour l'objet de la requ\u00eate en non lieu seulement, je conclus que l'all\u00e9gation de commentaires \u00e0 caract\u00e8res sexuels inappropri\u00e9s faits \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Fahmy \u00e0 deux occasions par S.M. ou A.W. (mais pas par M.G.) peut entra\u00eener une responsabilit\u00e9 de la GTAA. En particulier, la preuve de S.G. est cr\u00e9dible, pour l'objet de la requ\u00eate en non lieu, \u00e0 savoir que soit S.M., soit A.W. a fait des commentaires d\u00e9nigrants contre Mme Fahmy lors de deux rencontres entre les trois hommes. Les commentaires \u00e9taient sexuellement d\u00e9gradants, parlaient de la plaignante en situation de fellation et avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prof\u00e9r\u00e9s par un gestionnaire de la GTAA. De tels commentaires, m\u00eame s'ils n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9s \u00e0 son attention qu'apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, peuvent avoir constitu\u00e9 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable et avoir jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le cong\u00e9diement de Mme Fahmy en raison de son sexe. Cette conclusion comprend la preuve de Mme Fahmy selon laquelle S.M. aurait pass\u00e9 des commentaires sexistes tels que [TRADUCTION] c'est encore un monde d'hommes et [TRADUCTION] laissez les hommes gagner. J'ai aussi tenu compte du fait que Mme Fahmy \u00e9tait la seule femme dans le d\u00e9partement de la TI sous la supervision de S.M.\n[28] Je conclus aussi, pour l'objet de la requ\u00eate en non lieu seulement, qu'il existait des preuves qui, si on leur pr\u00eate foi, pourraient entra\u00eener une responsabilit\u00e9 pour la contravention \u00e0 l'article 7 en raison de la race, de l'origine nationale ou ethnique et de la couleur. En particulier, tous les incidents suivants montrent, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, qu'il y a eu une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable de Mme Fahmy, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il soit d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi, diff\u00e9rence de traitement fond\u00e9e sur sa race, son origine nationale ou ethnique et sa couleur :\nelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e comme responsable technique du projet d'infrastructure MS Windows 2000, mais cette responsabilit\u00e9 lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e et a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 M.G., un entrepreneur blanc dont les qualifications \u00e9taient moindres que celles de la plaignante; le travail du Centre de pr\u00e9production lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre entrepreneur blanc, B.M., qui \u00e9tait aussi moins qualifi\u00e9 qu'elle; Mme Fahmy a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue de r\u00e9unions, y compris celle du 30 janvier, alors que les entrepreneurs blancs ne l'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 (c'est \u00e0 dire A.W., D.M., B.M., M.G.); S.M. a fait un commentaire d\u00e9nigrant qui peut \u00eatre per\u00e7u comme visant les employ\u00e9s ou les entrepreneurs de couleur qui [TRADUCTION] ont des accents : [TRADUCTION] Je veux des gens qui peuvent mieux communiquer; les employ\u00e9s blancs ont re\u00e7u de la formation, mais pas la plaignante ni les autres employ\u00e9s de couleur; des coll\u00e8gues masculins blancs ont eu acc\u00e8s au r\u00e9seau de campus, mais pas la plaignante ni les autres employ\u00e9s ou entrepreneurs de couleur; en ce qui a trait \u00e0 tous les motifs de distinction illicites cit\u00e9s, il existe des preuves selon lesquelles S.M. a dit \u00e0 D.M. d'[TRADUCTION] inventer des probl\u00e8mes de rendement et des lacunes pour justifier le cong\u00e9diement de Mme Fahmy. Cela aurait eu lieu avant que sa p\u00e9riode de probation soit prolong\u00e9e, ce qui entache la bonne foi du processus complet d'\u00e9valuation de rendement et le prolongement de sa p\u00e9riode de probation.\nVI. LES MOTIFS DE LA D\u00c9CISION SUR LE FOND [29] Apr\u00e8s avoir rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en non lieu, j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e si elle souhaitait pr\u00e9senter des preuves. Tout naturellement, Mme Rusak a r\u00e9pondu par l'affirmative et j'ai entendu ses t\u00e9moins et la br\u00e8ve preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en r\u00e9ponse par Mme Fahmy. Ci dessous se trouvent les motifs pour lesquels je rejette la plainte sur le fond.\nA. Le droit [30] Dans le cadre de plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de la LCDP, il incombe d'abord au plaignant ou \u00e0 la Commission d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination5 : Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28. Une fois cela \u00e9tabli, c'est \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 qu'il incombe d'\u00e9tablir une justification ou une explication de l'acte discriminatoire. La r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas \u00eatre prise en compte dans la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination : Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 2004, au paragraphe 22.\n[31] Le principe l\u00e9gal suivant est aussi pertinent quant \u00e0 l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce : Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit le seul motif derri\u00e8re le comportement en question pour que la plainte soit justifi\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination soit l'un des facteurs qui aient compt\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur : Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) (2001), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/443 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 69.\n[32] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet la difficult\u00e9 de prouver des all\u00e9gations de discrimination avec des preuves directes. La discrimination est souvent pratiqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s subtile et cach\u00e9e. La discrimination ouverte est rare : Basi c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 5038. En fait, le Tribunal a la t\u00e2che de tenir compte de toutes les circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer s'il existe, comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit dans l'affaire Basi, de subtiles odeurs de discrimination.\n[33] La norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination est la norme civile habituelle, \u00e0 savoir la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Selon cette norme, on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible : Premakumar c. Air Canada (No 2) (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 81.\nB. Les conclusions sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 [34] \u00c0 titre d'arbitre, je reconnais que la salle d'audience est un environnement artificiel dans lequel les t\u00e9moins r\u00e9agissent de fa\u00e7ons individuelles et diff\u00e9rentes au stress d\u00e9coulant du t\u00e9moignage, etc. Par cons\u00e9quent, leur comportement n'est utilis\u00e9 que comme indice de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Le contenu de leur t\u00e9moignage et ce qu'ils ont fait, dit et \u00e9crit (comme la preuve documentaire est aussi importante) par le pass\u00e9 sont plus importants et forment la base de la question vis\u00e9e par la plainte qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, et de la fa\u00e7on dont leur t\u00e9moignage est re\u00e7u dans le contexte de la totalit\u00e9 de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Je tiens aussi \u00e0 ajouter que le fait de conclure qu'un t\u00e9moin est cr\u00e9dible ou non ne signifie pas que tout ce que le t\u00e9moin dit ou \u00e9crit est accept\u00e9 ou rejet\u00e9. J'ai tent\u00e9 de comprendre toute la preuve et de tirer des conclusions de fait au sujet de ce qui est r\u00e9ellement arriv\u00e9.\n[35] Comme dans de nombreux cas, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans mes motifs, je commente la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de divers t\u00e9moins. En particulier, je tiens \u00e0 commenter principalement la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de deux des t\u00e9moins les plus importants \u00e0 l'audience : la plaignante et S.M. Bien que S.M. ne f\u00fbt pas nomm\u00e9 comme partie dans le renvoi de la Commission, la plainte et la th\u00e8se de la plaignante ont toujours cibl\u00e9 S.M. comme agent discriminateur.\n[36] Mme Rusak soutient que la plaignante, D.M. et S.G. se sont parjur\u00e9s devant le Tribunal, parce que leur t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait si invraisemblable. Je n'irai pas jusqu'\u00e0 dire qu'ils se sont parjur\u00e9s, mais avant la fin de l'audience, leur cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait endommag\u00e9e.\n(i) La plaignante [37] J'ai dout\u00e9 de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante pendant toute l'audience, tant pour ce qu'elle a dit \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins que pour ce qu'elle a \u00e9crit dans ses courriels et ses lettres, par comparaison aux t\u00e9moignages des autres t\u00e9moins. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible et son t\u00e9moignage n'\u00e9tait souvent pas fiable. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pendant presque huit jours. Mme Fahmy \u00e9tait souvent \u00e9vasive. Elle a souvent omis de r\u00e9pondre la premi\u00e8re fois qu'on lui posait une question; il fallait parfois r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la question plusieurs fois, en particulier en contre interrogatoire. Parfois, elle se contredisait dans l'espace de quelques minutes, et elle s'est certainement contredit entre l'interrogatoire principal et son contre interrogatoire. Je ne crois pas qu'il y ait eu de probl\u00e8me de langue. Bien que l'anglais ne soit pas sa premi\u00e8re langue et bien qu'elle ne soit pas compl\u00e8tement bilingue, sa comp\u00e9tence en anglais est tr\u00e8s bonne, tant sur le plan verbal qu'\u00e9crit. Je tire cette conclusion en fonction de son t\u00e9moignage et des nombreux documents qu'elle a \u00e9crits et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve. Je lui ai m\u00eame demand\u00e9 si elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre les questions. Elle a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative. J'ai parfois remarqu\u00e9 qu'elle tentait d'anticiper la question du contre interrogateur avant qu'elle lui soit pos\u00e9e. Je suis intervenu souvent, l'avisant que je comprenais qu'il s'agissait d'une situation stressante, mais qu'elle devait \u00e9couter attentivement la question et r\u00e9pondre directement \u00e0 la question.\n[38] En plus de son comportement \u00e9vasif, le contenu d'un bon nombre de ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e9tait invraisemblable. Je ne crois pas qu'elle ait r\u00e9pondu de fa\u00e7on honn\u00eate \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des questions. En effet, \u00e0 une occasion, Mme Rusak lui a pos\u00e9 une question et la plaignante a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne se concentrait pas, parce qu'elle lisait l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve de l'\u00e9valuation de rendement. L'avocate a r\u00e9pondu que c'\u00e9tait faux, que la plaignante la regardait directement, [TRADUCTION] la d\u00e9visageait. Mme Fahmy a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Ouais. D'accord...Vous ne savez pas... Je vous regarde et je lis. Je regardais Mme Fahmy pendant toute la discussion. Mme Rusak avait raison.\n[39] Plus tard dans mes motifs, sous les divers intertitres des all\u00e9gations, je traiterai d'une partie du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante et de celui des autres t\u00e9moins \u00e0 son sujet qui ont soulev\u00e9 des doutes au sujet de sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Pour l'instant, je donnerai quelques exemples. Premi\u00e8rement, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que Mme Fahmy avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on inexacte son exp\u00e9rience dans le curriculum vitae qu'elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la GTAA par l'entremise de l'agence de placement Agelon lorsqu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e. En particulier, dans le curriculum vitae qu'elle a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission apr\u00e8s son emploi \u00e0 la GTAA, elle a \u00e9crit sous le titre [TRADUCTION] Exp\u00e9rience de travail qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 une [TRADUCTION] analyste principale de r\u00e9seau \u00e0 la GTAA. Cela \u00e9tait clairement faux. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a reconnu qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e \u00e0 la GTAA \u00e0 titre d'[TRADUCTION] analyste de r\u00e9seau et non \u00e0 titre d'[TRADUCTION] analyste principale de r\u00e9seau. Elle savait qu'il existait une diff\u00e9rence claire entre les deux emplois, quant \u00e0 la classification, au salaire, aux t\u00e2ches et aux responsabilit\u00e9s. Elle a fait la m\u00eame chose avec les autres anciens employeurs dans ce curriculum vitae (c'est \u00e0 dire qu'elle a ajout\u00e9 le mot [TRADUCTION] principale). Le curriculum vitae qu'elle a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la GTAA par l'entremise de l'agence de placement, en avril 2002, est diff\u00e9rent de celui qu'elle a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission et qui comprenait ses emplois apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement de la GTAA. De plus, les dates auxquelles elle avait travaill\u00e9 pour plusieurs employeurs n'\u00e9taient pas les m\u00eames sur les deux curriculum vitae : dans l'un des cas, celui de l'Office ontarien de financement, il y avait une diff\u00e9rence de sept mois. Elle avait aussi omis d'inscrire une compagnie pour laquelle elle avait travaill\u00e9 pendant plus d'un an dans le curriculum vitae qu'elle avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la GTAA. Lorsqu'on l'a contre interrog\u00e9e au sujet des diff\u00e9rences, elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'un pr\u00eatre lui avait dit qu'elle pouvait le faire, [TRADUCTION] [...] ce n'est pas un mensonge si vous mettez le m\u00eame nombre d'ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience. Le nombre de compagnies n'importe pas. Mme Fahmy a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'on lui avait aussi dit qu'elle pouvait raccourcir son curriculum vitae, tant qu'elle soulignait les points importants. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait parl\u00e9 avec une personne des ressources humaines du gouvernement de l'Ontario [TRADUCTION] au sujet de la fa\u00e7on de pr\u00e9parer un curriculum vitae et de le raccourcir. Elle a sous entendu que l'employ\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re lui avait dit qu'elle pouvait modifier les p\u00e9riodes de travail afin d'\u00e9viter les [TRADUCTION] trous dans son emploi. Elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] [...] lorsque je pr\u00e9sente ma candidature pour un poste qui n'est pas principal, je retire le mot principal partout ou je le rajoute. Il ne s'agit pas d'exactitude. Il s'agit de r\u00e9pondre aux questions de l'employeur et d'\u00eatre capable d'effectuer le travail. En contre interrogatoire, elle a reconnu que le curriculum vitae qu'elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour obtenir son emploi \u00e0 la GTAA n'\u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8tement [TRADUCTION] v\u00e9ridique et exact.\n[40] Une autre situation qui porte pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et qui rend son t\u00e9moignage non fiable porte sur la question de savoir si elle \u00e9tait occup\u00e9e ou non pendant qu'elle travaillait \u00e0 la GTAA et si elle a accept\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation de son travail dans les \u00e9valuations de rendement. Il suffit de dire que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait contradictoire. \u00c0 un moment, elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas occup\u00e9e de 50 \u00e0 60 p. 100 du temps de janvier \u00e0 mai 2003, parce qu'on lui avait enlev\u00e9 du travail. Elle a soutenu ce fait, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'elle avait constamment demand\u00e9 le paiement d'heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et malgr\u00e9 la preuve de plusieurs t\u00e9moins, selon lesquels il s'agissait d'une p\u00e9riode occup\u00e9e et qu'il y avait beaucoup de travail pour tous. De plus, elle avait r\u00e9pondu dans un courriel du 8 avril 2003, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande de S.M. visant \u00e0 obtenir les horaires de travail de ses employ\u00e9s, qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9e : [TRADUCTION] Activit\u00e9 quotidienne : Soutien de WNT\/2000 et des serveurs Exchange 90 % de mon temps. En contre interrogatoire, lorsqu'on lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que sa r\u00e9ponse au courriel \u00e9tait simplement fausse, elle a r\u00e9pondu que S.M. aurait d\u00fb savoir \u00e0 quel point ils \u00e9taient occup\u00e9s : [TRADUCTION] [...] le gestionnaire devrait savoir ce que nous faisons. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle craignait que si elle disait qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas occup\u00e9e, elle serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e.\n[41] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Fahmy au sujet des \u00e9valuations de rendement soul\u00e8ve aussi des doutes au sujet de sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas lu l'\u00e9valuation compl\u00e8te du 8 novembre 2002; elle en avait lu des parties et elle n'en comprenait pas certaines parties. Plus tard, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] une grande partie, j'ai lue, mais je n'\u00e9tais pas d'accord. Une petite partie, je n'ai jamais lue. Ses r\u00e9ponses sont prises de pair avec la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite qu'elle a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette question. Apr\u00e8s avoir lu l'\u00e9valuation de rendement et sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite, je conclus qu'elle n'aurait pas pu \u00e9crire ce qu'elle a \u00e9crit sans avoir lu l'\u00e9valuation compl\u00e8te. De plus, dans sa lettre du 5 mai 2003 \u00e0 la Commission, Mme Fahmy a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la page 2 : [TRADUCTION] Ensuite, je suis retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison et j'ai lu l'\u00e9valuation de rendement et j'ai trouv\u00e9 trop de fausses accusations. Il est \u00e9vident qu'elle a lu l'\u00e9valuation, comme elle le devait, puisqu'elle avait la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9e en probation de lire l'\u00e9valuation afin de comprendre les domaines pour lesquels elle devait s'am\u00e9liorer.\n[42] En ce qui a trait au contenu de l'\u00e9valuation de rendement, elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne l'acceptait pas. Il existe clairement des documents qui font \u00e9tat de sa pr\u00e9occupation au sujet de certaines parties de l'\u00e9valuation, y compris l'affirmation selon laquelle elle n'avait pas respect\u00e9 de nombreuses \u00e9ch\u00e9ances et les exemples qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s plus tard. Pourtant, elle a aussi \u00e9crit qu'elle acceptait et qu'elle tenterait de s'am\u00e9liorer. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 cette note en d\u00e9clarant qu'elle [TRADUCTION] tentait de le [S.M.] gagner et qu'elle ne pensait pas ce qu'elle avait \u00e9crit. Elle a \u00e9crit \u00e0 S.M. qu'elle l'aimait [TRADUCTION] tellement, alors qu'en fait elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle croyait que S.M. \u00e9tait raciste \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, mais qu'elle [TRADUCTION] tentait de le mettre de son bord. Pour l'essentiel, je trouve difficile de conclure si elle disait la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re fois, ou si elle disait la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 au sujet du fait qu'elle n'avait pas dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n[43] Son t\u00e9moignage au sujet de sa rencontre du 6 d\u00e9cembre 2002 avec la gestionnaire des ressources humaines Maria Maack est invraisemblable aussi dans l'ensemble. Elle soutient qu'elle a montr\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Maack des courriels qui d\u00e9montraient que S.M. la [TRADUCTION] harcelait et qu'il ne l'aimait pas parce qu'elle \u00e9tait une femme. Il n'existe aucun courriel \u00e0 l'appui de cette all\u00e9gation. Elle soutient qu'elle voulait que Mme Maack lance une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Maack avait refus\u00e9 de faire quoi que ce soit. Mme Fahmy a aussi \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] La question de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e seulement entre moi et Maria Maack. Je conclus que sa preuve est compl\u00e8tement invraisemblable. Je n'accepte pas son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel elle a alert\u00e9 une gestionnaire exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e des ressources humaines, qui forme d'autres personnes au sujet de la discrimination et du harc\u00e8lement et qui enqu\u00eate dans de tels cas, et que Mme Maack ait refus\u00e9 de faire quoi que ce soit. Cela contreviendrait \u00e0 la convention collective et aux politiques internes contre la discrimination et le harc\u00e8lement de la GTAA. Comme Mme Maack l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, si elle n'avait absolument rien fait comme Mme Fahmy le soutient, elle (Mme Maack) n'aurait plus d'emploi. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de vive voix de Mme Maack et son courriel \u00e0 S.M. ainsi que la note au dossier dat\u00e9e du 9 d\u00e9cembre 2002 et je suis d'avis que ces preuves refl\u00e8tent ce qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Je tiens \u00e0 ajouter que j'ai trouv\u00e9 que Mme Maack \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible.\n(ii) S.M. [44] S.M. \u00e9tait le gestionnaire de Mme Fahmy. Il avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler plusieurs semaines apr\u00e8s que Mme Fahmy eut commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 la GTAA. Il \u00e9tait un nouveau gestionnaire et, en effet, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais effectu\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation de rendement auparavant. Bien que je n'accepte pas tout de son t\u00e9moignage, en majeure partie, je conclus que S.M. \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible et que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait fiable. Il a r\u00e9pondu aux questions de fa\u00e7on br\u00e8ve et son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix concordait en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 ses courriels et \u00e0 ses lettres ainsi qu'\u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[45] Il y a un point que je n'ai pas accept\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage : celui qui portait sur le fait que Mme Fahmy \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e la responsable technique du projet W2000 [TRADUCTION] jusqu'au dernier jour. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage des autres t\u00e9moins ainsi que la preuve documentaire, je conclus que bien qu'elle f\u00fbt toujours une analyste de r\u00e9seau (le poste pour lequel elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e), au moment de son cong\u00e9diement, Mme Fahmy n'\u00e9tait plus la responsable technique du projet W2000. Par exemple, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage d'Ozgur Erkucuk selon lequel elle a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] retir\u00e9e du projet. J'y reviendrai plus tard dans mes motifs.\nC. Les all\u00e9gations : Introduction [46] Je traiterai maintenant des nombreuses all\u00e9gations de la plaignante et des questions en litige qui en d\u00e9coulent, all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur les alin\u00e9as 7a) et 7b) de la LCDP. Certaines all\u00e9gations portent sur tous les motifs de distinction illicite, alors que d'autres portent seulement sur le motif du sexe, et d'autres portent sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique ou la couleur seulement. \u00c0 l'exception des cas o\u00f9 je le pr\u00e9cise, chaque all\u00e9gation porte sur les quatre motifs de distinction illicite cit\u00e9s. Mme MacKinnon, l'avocate de la plaignante, soutient que chaque all\u00e9gation de diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable peut ne pas, \u00e0 elle seule, imposer une responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la GTAA, mais que les all\u00e9gations dans leur ensemble imposent une telle responsabilit\u00e9.\n[47] Dans les conclusions finales, Mme MacKinnon m'a demand\u00e9 de conclure qu'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement, bien qu'elle n'ait pas avanc\u00e9 d'all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l'article 14. L'avocate de la GTAA a soulev\u00e9 une objection. La GTAA n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de cette all\u00e9gation et j'ai expliqu\u00e9 que je ne permettrais pas \u00e0 la plaignante de faire indirectement ce qu'elle ne pouvait pas faire directement. La plainte a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme une plainte de contravention \u00e0 l'article 7 seulement; l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas re\u00e7u d'avis raisonnable. Pour des raisons de justice naturelle, aucune all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement ne sera examin\u00e9e contre l'intim\u00e9e.\nD. All\u00e9gation no 1 : S.M. lui a retir\u00e9 du travail et l'a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 B.M. et M.G. [48] Il s'agit d'une partie importante de la plainte de Mme Fahmy. Mme Fahmy soutient qu'elle \u00e9tait la responsable technique du projet Windows 2000 au d\u00e9part, qu'on lui a enlev\u00e9 ses t\u00e2ches principales et qu'on les a donn\u00e9es \u00e0 deux entrepreneurs masculins blancs - B.M. et M.G. - qui \u00e9taient moins qualifi\u00e9s qu'elle. Elle soutient que, par cons\u00e9quent, on l'a rel\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches moins importantes. Pour traiter cette all\u00e9gation, je dois examiner exactement ce qu'\u00e9tait son emploi \u00e0 la GTAA.\n[49] Mme Fahmy a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e comme analyste de r\u00e9seau. Responsable technique ne faisait pas partie de sa d\u00e9signation d'emploi. Selon la description de poste, on pouvait lui attribuer divers projets \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion de son gestionnaire, qui pouvait la nommer responsable technique. Un [TRADUCTION] avis de poste vacant et un document [TRADUCTION] de donn\u00e9es sur les analyses de t\u00e2ches qui pr\u00e9cisent les exigences du poste et les t\u00e2ches d'un analyste de r\u00e9seau de la GTAA ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve. Mme Fahmy a soutenu que ces documents s'appliquaient \u00e0 elle, apr\u00e8s certaines modifications. Elle n'acceptait pas le point au sujet du fait que son gestionnaire pouvait lui attribuer d'autres t\u00e2ches. Dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de la GTAA \u00e0 la Commission, elle a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Le poste porte strictement sur la mise en uvre et le soutien de Windows 2000\/NT. Selon elle, S.M., A.W. et M.G., sa t\u00e2che principale \u00e9tait d'\u00eatre la responsable technique du projet Windows 2000, de convertir les donn\u00e9es et les utilisateurs de Windows NT \u00e0 Windows 2000. Il s'agissait du projet le plus gros et le plus dispendieux du d\u00e9partement de la TI \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. D.L. \u00e9tait le gestionnaire de projet et D.M. \u00e9tait l'architecte. Mme Fahmy devait travailler en collaboration avec D.M.\n[50] Pour obtenir une meilleure compr\u00e9hension de son emploi, examinons ce que Mme Fahmy a \u00e9crit dans sa description d'emploi sur son curriculum vitae apr\u00e8s son emploi \u00e0 la GTAA, \u00e0 la page 2 :\nAutorit\u00e9 a\u00e9roportuaire du Grand Toronto Juillet 2002 \u00e0 mai 2003\nAnalyste principale de r\u00e9seau\nPlanification et mise en uvre des services Active Directory et d\u00e9ploiement des serveurs Windows 2000 Advanced servers.\nMaintenance et surveillance de 72 serveurs Windows NT et 2000, y compris les services DHCP, WINS et DDNS.\nConfiguration de r\u00e9seaux locaux virtuels (Vlans) et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des ports de commutateurs Cisco, s\u00e9ries 1900, 2900 et 3500.\nMaintenance des syst\u00e8mes Exchange 5.5 server et Exchange 2000 server.\nMise en uvre des syst\u00e8mes SMS 2.0 et SQL server 2000.\nMise en place d'un syst\u00e8me de secours pour le service RSASecurID.\nParticipation \u00e0 l'am\u00e9nagement de la salle des ordinateurs et pr\u00e9paration de l'ensemble des armoires et serveurs achet\u00e9s.\n[51] Les t\u00e2ches ci dessus, d\u00e9crites dans les mots de la plaignante, d\u00e9mentent sa plainte et son t\u00e9moignage au sujet du fait que son travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit et qu'une partie de ses t\u00e2ches avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 d'autres, lui laissant un r\u00f4le moins important qu'auparavant. Elle a \u00e9crit qu'elle avait [TRADUCTION] planifi\u00e9 et mis en uvre les services Active Directory et le d\u00e9ploiement des serveurs Windows 2000 Advanced servers. Il s'agit de t\u00e2ches de responsable technique, au sujet desquelles elle a d'abord soutenu que D.M. et V.J. n'avaient pas reconnu sa contribution, et, lorsqu'il est devenu \u00e9vident que l'architecture du syst\u00e8me ne fonctionnait pas et devait \u00eatre remplac\u00e9e ou r\u00e9par\u00e9e, au sujet desquelles elle a soutenu qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas du tout responsable, parce qu'on lui avait retir\u00e9 son travail. Dans son curriculum vitae, elle a par hasard omis de mentionner que le d\u00e9ploiement du syst\u00e8me Windows 2000 qu'elle avait [TRADUCTION] planifie et mis en uvre \u00e9tait un \u00e9chec.\n[52] Pendant l'audience, il y a eu de la confusion au sujet de ce que le r\u00f4le exact de Mme Fahmy \u00e9tait, y compris la terminologie - [TRADUCTION] responsable technique, [TRADUCTION] principal, [TRADUCTION] sup\u00e9rieur et [TRADUCTION] coordonnateur. J'accepte l'explication selon laquelle [TRADUCTION] responsable technique et [TRADUCTION] principale \u00e9taient interchangeables. Le terme [TRADUCTION] sup\u00e9rieur a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 par divers t\u00e9moins dans le sens de : qui a le plus d'anciennet\u00e9, le plus de connaissances, le responsable. Le terme [TRADUCTION] analyste principal de r\u00e9seau est aussi un terme technique de l'industrie et appartient \u00e0 une classification distincte dans la convention collective de la GTAA. A.W., qui est entr\u00e9 en poste en janvier 2003 pour s'occuper des probl\u00e8mes de conception et de mise en uvre du syst\u00e8me W2000, a soutenu que la plaignante [TRADUCTION] \u00e9tait la ressource technique principale pour Windows pour le projet W2000. S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait la coordonnatrice de Windows 2000 pour son d\u00e9partement : la [TRADUCTION] principale. Il a soutenu : [TRADUCTION] La responsabilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de coordination appartenait \u00e0 D.M. et D.L. [...] Elle \u00e9tait la seule ressource permanente de l'\u00e9quipe [pour le projet de Windows 2000]. Elle l'a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9. On ne lui a jamais enlev\u00e9, m\u00eame jusqu'au dernier jour, elle \u00e9tait la principale personne responsable, m\u00eame si j'avais des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de son rendement. Il a aussi soutenu que D.M. et M.G. ont, au d\u00e9part, \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s pour l'aider, parce qu'il s'agissait d'un gros projet.\n[53] Le t\u00e9moignage contradictoire de Mme Fahmy au sujet de son r\u00f4le et de ses responsabilit\u00e9s est \u00e9vident dans les \u00e9changes suivants entre elle et Mme Rusak :\nQ. [...] vous avez dit que vous aviez mal compris parce que vous croyiez que vous \u00e9tiez la sup\u00e9rieure pour Windows 2000.\nR. Quand j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e - oui, je ne suis pas une sup\u00e9rieure avec un titre, mais je suis responsable de m'assurer que tout va bien avec Windows 2000. Et s'il y avait un probl\u00e8me, je le r\u00e9glais.\nQ. [...] Vous n'avez pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de sup\u00e9rieure, pourtant vous tentiez d'assumer le r\u00f4le d'une sup\u00e9rieure.\nR. Je n'ai pas assum\u00e9 le r\u00f4le [...] Je connais Windows 2000 au niveau sup\u00e9rieur, oui. Je ne suis pas une sup\u00e9rieure. Je connais simplement mon produit au niveau d'une sup\u00e9rieure [...] Je suis la seule responsable. Seulement une personne. Et j'avais la permission de corriger les erreurs d'autres personnes. Donc c'\u00e9tait ma responsabilit\u00e9. S'ils causaient un probl\u00e8me, je le r\u00e9glais. J'\u00e9tais donc la personne qui avait le plus de connaissances de Windows.\nQ. Donc vous dites qu'\u00e0 titre de responsable technique, vous ne pouviez pas d\u00e9terminer qui, pour reprendre vos mots, avait bousill\u00e9 les syst\u00e8mes, parce qu'il y avait trop de personnes qui les utilisaient.\nR. Je ne suis pas la responsable technique. Je n'\u00e9tais pas enti\u00e8rement la responsable technique.\nQ. Vous avez dit que vous \u00e9tiez la responsable technique. Je vous ai demand\u00e9 si vous \u00e9tiez la responsable technique du projet W2K, vous avez dit oui. Maintenant vous n'\u00eates pas la responsable technique.\nR. Non. Je ne suis pas la responsable technique - le probl\u00e8me, c'est que [S.M.] a min\u00e9 ma responsabilit\u00e9 et qu'il ne voulait pas que - il ne respectait pas mes connaissances, donc je n'\u00e9tais pas la responsable technique. Je devais l'\u00eatre, mais je ne l'\u00e9tais pas.\n[54] S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Elle devait comprendre ce qui \u00e9tait construit, pour qu'elle puisse le soutenir et accepter le syst\u00e8me pour le d\u00e9partement et ensuite le soutenir. Dans son courriel \u00e0 Mme Fahmy dat\u00e9 du 12 novembre 2002 (apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut re\u00e7u sa premi\u00e8re \u00e9valuation de rendement et qu'elle eut r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne comprenait pas bien son r\u00f4le), S.M. a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ses responsabilit\u00e9s :\n[TRADUCTION]\n[...]Vous faites partie de l'\u00e9quipe de projet Windows 2000. L'\u00e9quipe est g\u00e9r\u00e9e par [D.L. et D.M.]. Votre r\u00f4le principal (comme toujours) est d'aider \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement et au d\u00e9ploiement de la technologie W2K tout en devenant notre experte d\u00e9partementale dans le domaine de l'administration et de la croissance future (la conception) de la technologie W2K.\nEn d'autres mots, continuez \u00e0 soutenir l'\u00e9quipe W2K et assurez vous de comprendre comment le W2K a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l'A\u00e9roport international Lester B. Pearson. Lorsque l'environnement W2K sera enti\u00e8rement en production, vous serez la principale administratrice du W2K dans notre groupe. [M.G.] sera votre rempla\u00e7ant et devrait participer \u00e0 toutes les questions portant sur W2K. En plus de ce r\u00f4le, je m'attends \u00e0 ce que vous continuiez \u00e0 soutenir toute autre question de production qui pourrait survenir et qui n'a pas de r\u00e9percussion sur votre r\u00f4le dans le projet W2K. Je m'attends aussi \u00e0 ce que vous continuiez \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tout appel sur votre t\u00e9l\u00e9avertisseur.\nJe m'attends \u00e0 ce que vous continuiez \u00e0 contribuer \u00e0 l'\u00e9quipe et \u00e0 offrir vos id\u00e9es et vos suggestions lorsque des probl\u00e8mes surviennent.\n[55] Plusieurs commentaires d\u00e9coulent du courriel reproduit ci dessus. Premi\u00e8rement, je suis d'avis qu'il refl\u00e9tait justement le r\u00f4le de Mme Fahmy en date du 12 novembre 2002. Deuxi\u00e8mement, son gestionnaire pr\u00e9cise ses attentes et les communique clairement \u00e0 Mme Fahmy.\n[56] S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir envoy\u00e9 le courriel pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 du 12 novembre \u00e0 Mme Fahmy en r\u00e9ponse au fait qu'elle avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait confuse au sujet de son r\u00f4le, elle a r\u00e9pondu [TRADUCTION] Merci pour les pr\u00e9cisions. Elle n'\u00e9tait plus confuse au sujet de son r\u00f4le et de ses responsabilit\u00e9s. Cependant, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Un jour, elle le comprend; une semaine plus tard, elle est de nouveau confuse. Je dois lui renvoyer un courriel. C'est arriv\u00e9 au moins quatre fois; elle avait toujours besoins de r\u00e9troaction. Il a plus tard d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais eu \u00e0 s'occuper autant d'un employ\u00e9 ou d'un entrepreneur.\n[57] Au compte rendu de la r\u00e9union du 17 juillet 2002 au sujet du [TRADUCTION] Projet d'infrastructure de r\u00e9seau Windows 2000, \u00e0 laquelle D.M., Imran Asmal et la plaignante ont particip\u00e9, et dont D.L. et S.M. ont re\u00e7u copie, il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] La gestion \u00e0 venir du projet sera fond\u00e9e sur la participation \u00e9gale des trois principaux membres de l'\u00e9quipe [les trois personnes pr\u00e9sentes]. Mme Fahmy a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le compte rendu.\n[58] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve en d\u00e9tail, je conclus que Mme Fahmy a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e comme analyse de r\u00e9seau et que sa principale responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait d'\u00eatre la responsable technique du projet W2000, dirig\u00e9 par D.L. et D.M. Mme Fahmy se voyait attribuer d'autres t\u00e2ches de temps en temps, mais le projet W2000 devait occuper la majorit\u00e9 de son temps. Les notes de S.M., qui a d\u00fb lui dire qu'elle devait se concentrer sur le projet W2000 et ne pas s'inqui\u00e9ter des autres projets, appuient cette conclusion. Le courriel de Mme Fahmy \u00e0 S.M., dat\u00e9 du 6 septembre 2002, dans lequel elle se plaignait que D.M. et V.J. ne partageaient pas avec elle le m\u00e9rite de la conception confirme son r\u00f4le important dans le projet : [TRADUCTION] On a compl\u00e8tement ni\u00e9 et oubli\u00e9 mon aide. Je note que dans ce courriel, elle pr\u00e9cise son r\u00f4le dans le projet, ce qui montre qu'elle faisait partie int\u00e9grante du processus de conception. Mme Fahmy critique le travail de D.M. dans ce courriel. En effet, dans le m\u00eame courriel, elle a \u00e9crit en caract\u00e8res gras [TRADUCTION] [D.M.] n'avait pas d'exp\u00e9rience dans la migration de domaines W2K. Il l'a clairement dit lorsque nous avons commenc\u00e9 le projet. Maintenant, vous dites qu'il est l'expert et que c'est moi qui apprend. Qu'elle ait eu raison ou non, cela confirme le t\u00e9moignage de S.M. au sujet du fait qu'elle remettait toujours D.M. en question et qu'elle n'acceptait pas son r\u00f4le. Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que lorsque le projet semblait porter fruit, elle ne niait pas sa participation ni son r\u00f4le et elle se plaignait du fait qu'on ne lui reconnaissait pas sa contribution. Cependant, lorsqu'il est devenu apparent que la conception du syst\u00e8me \u00e9tait un \u00e9chec et qu'il faudrait une r\u00e9paration dispendieuse ou une reconstruction compl\u00e8te, elle a chang\u00e9 son fusil d'\u00e9paule. Elle a diminu\u00e9 l'importance de son r\u00f4le et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait aucun pouvoir de d\u00e9cision.\n[59] Bien que j'accepte que la plaignante fut, au d\u00e9part, embauch\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de responsable technique ou de [TRADUCTION] principale pour le projet W2000, je ne conclus pas qu'elle a occup\u00e9 cette fonction jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de son emploi le 1er mai 2003. Je n'accepte pas le t\u00e9moignage de S.M. \u00e0 ce sujet. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de A.W. et de S.G. lorsqu'ils ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la r\u00e9putation des personnes li\u00e9es \u00e0 la conception du premier syst\u00e8me W2000, qui a \u00e9chou\u00e9, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ternie en raison de cet \u00e9chec. Beaucoup de ces personnes n'\u00e9taient plus l\u00e0 en f\u00e9vrier 2003, auquel moment la GTAA a embauch\u00e9 un expert reconnu de Microsoft pour d\u00e9couvrir ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 et pour faire des recommandations. Le rapport de Microsoft, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2003, \u00e9tait une condamnation d\u00e9vastatrice du syst\u00e8me con\u00e7u et mont\u00e9 par l'\u00e9quipe D.L.\/D.M.\/V.J.\/Fahmy6 . Mme Fahmy n'\u00e9tait pas l'un des membres importants de l'\u00e9quipe \u00e0 \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9s. Je tiens \u00e0 ajouter que la GTAA a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, et que S.M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, que le rapport Microsoft et le r\u00f4le de Mme Fahmy dans la conception et la mise en uvre infructueuse de l'infrastructure W2000 n'ont jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de S.M. de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Bien que je croie que ce ne fut pas une raison explicite, je conclus que la r\u00e9putation de Mme Fahmy a \u00e9t\u00e9 ternie par sa participation au projet \u00e0 titre de responsable technique, comme S.G. l'a dit dans son t\u00e9moignage. Le mal fait \u00e0 sa r\u00e9putation, en plus des autres aspects n\u00e9gatifs de son travail et de ses interactions avec S.M., ont fait que S.M. a perdu confiance en ses habilit\u00e9s et qu'il lui a retir\u00e9 certaines de ses responsabilit\u00e9s (c'est \u00e0 dire la responsabilit\u00e9 technique du projet W2000).\n[60] De plus, il est naturel que S.M., \u00e9tant nouveau gestionnaire, souhaitait embaucher de nouvelles personnes, en particulier apr\u00e8s un tel d\u00e9sastre du point de vue des finances et des \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers. Je note aussi le courriel de S.G. \u00e0 M.G., dont Mme Fahmy a re\u00e7u une copie, dat\u00e9e du 18 mars 2003 [TRADUCTION] en retour sur la r\u00e9union de ce matin entre S.M., S.G. et M.G. Dans ce courriel, S.G. confirme qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que M.G. serait le principal ou le responsable technique, et que Mme Fahmy serait le second pour [TRADUCTION] l'administration et le soutien de WINS [le syst\u00e8me Enterprise W2000].\n[61] Je conclus que B.M. et M.G. n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s pour remplacer Mme Fahmy, comme elle le soutient. Ils ont d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s pour l'aider dans ce projet important \u00e0 l'automne 2002. De plus, M.G. devait \u00eatre le rempla\u00e7ant de Mme Fahmy. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M.G. et A.W. selon lequel il s'agissait d'une pratique courante et qu'il \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 avoir un rempla\u00e7ant pour chaque responsable technique ou principal, au cas o\u00f9 quelque chose arriverait \u00e0 cette personne, qu'elle soit en vacances, qu'elle tombe malade, etc. A.W. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] [...] en janvier, f\u00e9vrier, elle \u00e9tait toujours responsable technique et il s'agissait d'une grande responsabilit\u00e9 pour une seule personne. Cependant, lorsqu'il est devenu \u00e9vident que le syst\u00e8me ne fonctionnait pas, la r\u00e9putation des principaux acteurs a \u00e9t\u00e9 ternie - D.L., D.M. et Mme Fahmy. Cela a d\u00e9truit leur cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Ajoutant cela aux probl\u00e8mes de mauvais comportement et d'insubordination ou de comportement non professionnel de Mme Fahmy que S.M. avaient remarqu\u00e9s (par exemple, le fait qu'elle d\u00e9fiait toujours S.M. et D.M., l'incident d'ouverture et de fermeture de porte du 13 novembre dans le bureau de S.M., lorsqu'elle lui a tourn\u00e9 le dos et a quitt\u00e9 la r\u00e9union du 8 novembre, etc.), je crois que S.M. a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de diminuer ses t\u00e2ches \u00e0 titre de responsable technique du projet W2000. \u00c0 la fin de f\u00e9vrier 2003, comme l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier du Terminal 1 approchait rapidement et que le rapport de Microsoft avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, les sup\u00e9rieurs de S.M. ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de remonter le syst\u00e8me W2000, ce qui leur co\u00fbterait tr\u00e8s cher. Je ne crois pas que S.M. avait suffisamment confiance en Mme Fahmy pour lui laisser le titre de responsable technique pour la reconstruction du syst\u00e8me. S.G., A.W. et M.G. devaient \u00eatre les principaux acteurs du nouveau projet Enterprise W2000. Mme Fahmy n'a gard\u00e9 que le nom de responsable technique pour le premier projet W2000 de mars 2003 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de son emploi.\n[62] M\u00eame si j'ai conclu que, \u00e0 partir d'environ mars 2003, Mme Fahmy ne portait que le nom de responsable technique pour le premier projet W2000 inutilisable, et non pour le nouveau projet Enterprise W2000, je ne rel\u00e8ve aucune responsabilit\u00e9 au sens de la LCDP pour plusieurs raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, la d\u00e9cision n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'un des motifs de distinction illicite que Mme Fahmy a all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. La d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur sa participation au premier projet W2000, qui a \u00e9chou\u00e9, sur son rendement de travail inconstant et sur ses conflits de personnalit\u00e9 avec son gestionnaire, S.M. Deuxi\u00e8mement, elle portait une partie de la responsabilit\u00e9 pour l'\u00e9chec du premier syst\u00e8me W2000, avec D.L., qui \u00e9tait le gestionnaire du projet, et D.M., qui \u00e9tait l'architecte. Troisi\u00e8mement, on lui a donn\u00e9 d'autres t\u00e2ches importantes, telles que l'achat d'\u00e9quipement et la tenue de l'inventaire. Elle donnait aussi du soutien aux usagers et r\u00e9pondait aux tickets HEAT. De plus, S.M. lui a offert de travailler sur le site de construction du Terminal 1 et elle a refus\u00e9. D.M. a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 cette t\u00e2che. Il est important de se rappeler qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e comme analyste de r\u00e9seau et c'est ce qu'elle a fait jusqu'\u00e0 son dernier jour de travail \u00e0 la GTAA. Sa description de travail pr\u00e9voyait une certaine souplesse en ce qui a trait aux affectations, comme il est courant dans de nombreux milieux de travail. Comme il y avait plusieurs analystes de r\u00e9seau qui travaillaient dans les op\u00e9rations de syst\u00e8mes de la TI et dont les t\u00e2ches se chevauchaient, il n'est pas surprenant que la gestion ait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches de l'un \u00e0 l'autre.\n[63] En ce qui a trait au r\u00f4le de B.M. et M.G., je conclus qu'ils ne l'ont pas remplac\u00e9e. Ils avaient des r\u00f4les semblables, mais il existait aussi des diff\u00e9rences. M.G. est devenu le coordonnateur du deuxi\u00e8me projet W2000 (Enterprise) en mars 2003. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu le mois suivant par Gary Long, le 28 avril, \u00e0 un [TRADUCTION] poste de coordination des activit\u00e9s quotidiennes des Op\u00e9rations de syst\u00e8mes pendant que [S.M.] travaillait au terminal. S.M. \u00e9tait toujours le responsable des Op\u00e9rations de syst\u00e8mes de la TI, mais pour l'essentiel, il travaillait \u00e0 partir du site de construction du Terminal 1. Je conclus que le r\u00f4le de principal pour le projet du syst\u00e8me W2000 a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy et a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M.G. pour le syst\u00e8me Enterprise - le successeur du premier syst\u00e8me, qui avait \u00e9chou\u00e9. Selon le courriel de confirmation de S.G. du 18 mars 2003, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Mme Fahmy deviendrait le second pour [TRADUCTION] l'administration et le soutien de WINS. Je conclus que cela a constitu\u00e9 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable. Cependant, je conclus aussi que la d\u00e9cision n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur l'un des motifs de discrimination illicite que Mme Fahmy a all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'y a pas l\u00e0 de violation de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP.\n[64] Mme Fahmy soutient qu'on lui a enlev\u00e9 le travail du Centre de pr\u00e9production (le PPC) et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 B.M. J'ai entendu des t\u00e9moignages au sujet du fait que S.M. avait d'abord attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy la coordination du travail du PPC. Cependant, S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le projet \u00e9tait en retard [TRADUCTION] pour de nombreuses raisons. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy si elle avait besoin de plus de ressources. Il a soutenu qu'elle avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle se [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9brouillait. Plus tard, elle a accept\u00e9 qu'une autre personne soit ajout\u00e9e au projet pour l'aider - B.M. S.M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en octobre, la charge de travail avait augment\u00e9 et qu'elle avait accept\u00e9 que B.M. s'en occupe. S.M. a avis\u00e9 le groupe de la TI, dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 13 novembre 2002, que [TRADUCTION] [B.M.] s'occupera de l'horaire et de la coordination des activit\u00e9s des Op\u00e9rations de syst\u00e8mes de la TI li\u00e9es au PPC. Les besoins en mati\u00e8re d'essais du PPC ont augment\u00e9, alors S.M. a ult\u00e9rieurement embauch\u00e9 et \u00e9tabli une [TRADUCTION] ressource permanente pour s'occuper du travail, David Piatek. Mme Fahmy a contest\u00e9 la version de S.M. de ces faits; en particulier, elle a soutenu qu'on ne l'a pas consult\u00e9e et qu'elle n'a pas accept\u00e9 que B.M. lui prenne son r\u00f4le de coordonnatrice du travail du PPC.\n[65] Je conclus que le travail avait d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy, mais qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 temps et qu'elle a eu besoin de plus de ressources. Par cons\u00e9quent, B.M. a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour l'aider. Je conclus aussi que S.M. a ensuite d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9attribuer le r\u00f4le de coordonnateur du PPC \u00e0 B.M. et, plus tard, d'attribuer le travail \u00e0 M. Piatek. Ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de pourrait constituer une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 Mme Fahmy. Cependant, je ne rel\u00e8ve aucun lien entre la d\u00e9cision de d'abord demander \u00e0 B.M. d'aider Mme Fahmy, puis de lui donner le r\u00f4le de coordination du travail du PPC, et l'un des motifs de discrimination illicite all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par Mme Fahmy. Il s'agissait de d\u00e9cisions op\u00e9rationnelles l\u00e9gitimes de la part de S.M.\n[66] Je tiens \u00e0 noter qu'en une autre occasion, S.M. a enlev\u00e9 du travail \u00e0 Imran Asmal et l'a r\u00e9attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy. M. Asmal n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s heureux de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[67] Dans son t\u00e9moignage et dans sa preuve documentaire, Mme Fahmy soutient que non seulement B.M. et M.G. l'ont remplac\u00e9e, mais qu'ils \u00e9taient moins qualifi\u00e9s qu'elle. S.M. a contest\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation. De plus, A.W., que S.M. a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant une personne tr\u00e8s respect\u00e9e dans le domaine de la TI et un [TRADUCTION] expert, a dit que B.M. \u00e9tait une [TRADUCTION] superstar et que de nombreuses personnes lui demandaient de l'aide. Les capacit\u00e9s de M.G. ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9es. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu trois fois depuis son embauche \u00e0 la GTAA. En effet, \u00e0 un moment, Mme Fahmy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] Tant qu'il [M.G.] ne touche pas \u00e0 mon travail, il est qualifi\u00e9. Cela donne \u00e0 penser qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas du tout sinc\u00e8re lors de ses premi\u00e8res d\u00e9clarations au sujet de leur comp\u00e9tence. M\u00eame D.M., qui appuyait Mme Fahmy dans son t\u00e9moignage, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne voyait aucune diff\u00e9rence r\u00e9elle en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence technique entre Mme Fahmy, B.M. et M.G. Je conclus que B.M. et M.G. \u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9s pour effectuer le travail pour lequel la GTAA les avait embauch\u00e9s et les t\u00e2ches qui leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\nE. All\u00e9gation no 2 : La conversation du 3 ou du 4 septembre entre S.M. et Mme Fahmy [68] Mme Fahmy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que S.M. lui avait dit de laisser le travail de conception du syst\u00e8me W2000 \u00e0 V.J., un consultant de la TI qui travaillait sur le projet, et \u00e0 D.M., l'architecte responsable de la conception de l'infrastructure. Lorsque Mme Fahmy l'a questionn\u00e9, S.M. lui aurait dit [TRADUCTION] Me d\u00e9fiez vous? Vous \u00eates en probation. S.M. a soutenu que Mme Fahmy d\u00e9fiait constamment l'autorit\u00e9 et les d\u00e9cisions de D.M. et V.J. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que D.M. s'est souvent plaint \u00e0 ce sujet. D.M. n'a pas corrobor\u00e9 ce fait dans son t\u00e9moignage. S.M. a soutenu qu'il lui a seulement dit de [TRADUCTION] les laisser faire leur travail. J'admets le t\u00e9moignage de S.M. sur ce point. Il nie avoir dit [TRADUCTION] Me d\u00e9fiez vous? Vous \u00eates en probation. Je ne crois pas qu'il a dit cela.\n[69] En ce qui a trait au fait que Mme Fahmy d\u00e9fiait constamment le r\u00f4le et les d\u00e9cisions de D.M., il est possible que, d'une certaine fa\u00e7on, elle eut raison. La premi\u00e8re conception et construction du projet Windows 2000 avaient \u00e9chou\u00e9. Cependant, elle n'en a jamais avis\u00e9 S.M. En effet, en contre interrogatoire, elle a d'abord refus\u00e9 de m\u00eame admettre que la premi\u00e8re construction e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00e9chec. Elle l'a finalement reconnu. Je crois qu'elle r\u00e9sistait en raison de sa participation au projet, qui avait \u00e9chou\u00e9. Il s'agissait peut \u00eatre d'une strat\u00e9gie qu'on lui avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d'adopter et qu'elle avait d\u00e9crite dans son courriel du 6 septembre \u00e0 S.M., dans lequel elle se plaignait que D.M. et V.J. ne lui accordaient pas de m\u00e9rite pour son travail au projet W2000 :\nJ'aimerais que Gary Long sache quel \u00e9tait mon r\u00f4le dans le projet W2K.\nPremi\u00e8rement, je me souviens d'avoir eu un probl\u00e8me semblable chez Nortel Networks. Un coll\u00e8gue m'avait avis\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der comme suit :\n1. Ne pas \u00eatre proactive.\n2.Laisser les probl\u00e8mes se rendre d'abord \u00e0 la haute gestion, puis les r\u00e9soudre. Tous apprendront que vous avez r\u00e9solu le probl\u00e8me. Vous obtiendrez de l'attention et vous deviendrez un h\u00e9ro.\n[Soulign\u00e9 par Mme Fahmy.]\nBien entendu, ce n'est pas ce qui s'est pass\u00e9. Elle n'a pas r\u00e9solu les probl\u00e8mes et son nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9chec du projet.\n[70] En ce qui a trait au motif de distinction illicite du sexe seulement, la plaignante a soutenu que le 3 ou le 4 septembre 2002, S.M. a fait des commentaires sexistes. Premi\u00e8rement, il a dit qu'il ne voyait pas beaucoup de femmes dans le domaine de la TI et qu'il y en avait tr\u00e8s peu dans sa promotion. Il aurait dit [TRADUCTION] C'est un monde d'hommes, laissez les hommes gagner. M\u00eame si, dans la plainte, il semble que les commentaires aient \u00e9t\u00e9 prof\u00e9r\u00e9s le m\u00eame jour, \u00e0 l'audience, Mme Fahmy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 deux moments distincts. [TRADUCTION] Je ne les [all\u00e9gations] ai pas s\u00e9par\u00e9es par dates lorsque j'ai pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ma plainte. S.M. admet avoir fait le premier commentaire (c'est \u00e0 dire au sujet du peu de femmes en TI et dans sa classe). Il s'agit simplement de d\u00e9clarations factuelles qui n'entra\u00eenent certainement pas de responsabilit\u00e9 au sens de la LCDP. Il nie les derni\u00e8res d\u00e9clarations. J'accepte son t\u00e9moignage.\n[71] Pendant l'audience, la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e \u00e0 la GTAA, on lui avait dit que [TRADUCTION] [S.M.] n'aime pas les personnes qui ne sont pas blanches et que toutes les personnes qui \u00e9taient embauch\u00e9es \u00e9taient blanches. Il s'agit d'une des pires preuves par ou\u00ef dire : aucun nom, seulement des accusations p\u00e9joratives dommageables. Mme Fahmy h\u00e9sitait \u00e0 nommer ces personnes. Son avocate a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] les personnes qu'elle a nomm\u00e9es et qui seront appel\u00e9es \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner rapporteront ce qu'elles lui ont dit \u00e0 propos de leurs points de vue et - de leurs points de vue et de la fa\u00e7on dont elles ont eu ces points de vue, alors nous nous contentons de nous fonder sur ces t\u00e9moignages et nous ne nous fonderons pas sur le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante selon lequel il y avait d'autres personnes qu'elle n'a pas nomm\u00e9es et qui lui ont aussi donn\u00e9 leur avis. Cependant, aucun des t\u00e9moins n'a corrobor\u00e9 cette d\u00e9claration par ou\u00ef dire au sujet de S.M. et le fait qu'il n'aimait pas les personnes qui n'\u00e9taient pas blanches. Je n'accorde aucun poids \u00e0 cette preuve et je la rejette. En ce qui a trait au fait que seules des personnes blanches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es, cela est faux et, en effet, des employ\u00e9s blancs ont parfois \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s. S.M. n'a eu aucune tendance dans ses pratiques d'embauche et de cong\u00e9diement. En effet, la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s dans son d\u00e9partement \u00e9taient des personnes de couleur. L'avocate de la plaignante n'a pas soutenu qu'il y avait une tendance d'embauche syst\u00e9matiquement discriminatoire.\n[72] J'ai aussi entendu des t\u00e9moignages au sujet du fait que Mme Fahmy \u00e9tait la seule employ\u00e9e sous la supervision de S.M. Une fois de plus, Mme MacKinnon ne soutient pas qu'il y a eu une tendance d'embauche \u00e0 proprement parler qui constitue une pratique discriminatoire. Le fait que Mme Fahmy \u00e9tait la seule femme sous la supervision de S.M. ne prouve rien de discriminatoire \u00e0 proprement parler. J'ai examin\u00e9 la preuve afin de d\u00e9terminer si le fait qu'elle \u00e9tait la seule femme a entra\u00een\u00e9 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable pour Mme Fahmy. Je conclus que ce n'est pas le cas.\n[73] Je tiens \u00e0 commenter le t\u00e9moignage de l'un des t\u00e9moins de la plaignante, Ozgur Erkucuk. Il a travaill\u00e9 comme analyste de r\u00e9seau avec Mme Fahmy. Comme elle, il est une personne de couleur et il \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un syndicat. Il est ensuite retourn\u00e9 travailler pour la GTAA \u00e0 titre de consultant et son superviseur actuel est M.G. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'environnement de travail de la GTAA est multiculturel et multiracial. Bien qu'il n'ait pu se souvenir de certaines des d\u00e9clarations qu'il aurait faites \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission, son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix a \u00e9t\u00e9 clair. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas entendu ou vu quoi que ce soit qui donnait \u00e0 penser que la plaignante \u00e9tait victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs de distinction illicite qu'elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait vrai qu'elle \u00e9tait la seule femme dans le groupe de la TI de S.M. Il a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] compr\u00e9hensible pour un nouveau gestionnaire, qui ne conna\u00eet pas les comp\u00e9tences et les niveaux de rendement de ses employ\u00e9s, d'embaucher de nouvelles personnes. Mme MacKinnon insinue dans ses arguments que le t\u00e9moin s'est parjur\u00e9. Je note qu'elle n'a pas tent\u00e9 de le faire d\u00e9clarer t\u00e9moin hostile. Bien que son t\u00e9moignage n'ait sans doute pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ce que la plaignante esp\u00e9rait (il \u00e9tait son t\u00e9moin), je conclus que M. Erkucuk \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible et j'accepte son t\u00e9moignage. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de corroborer une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable envers Mme Fahmy fond\u00e9e sur les motifs all\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP.\n[74] Je crois que la plaignante constituait un d\u00e9fi en mati\u00e8re de gestion pour S.M. et qu'il n'aimait pas le fait qu'elle d\u00e9fiait son autorit\u00e9. Je note qu'il s'est plaint au sujet de S.G. qui faisait cela, qui ne respectait pas la hi\u00e9rarchie, etc. Peut \u00eatre que comme nouveau gestionnaire, S.M. \u00e9tait sensible aux employ\u00e9s et aux entrepreneurs qui le [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9fiaient. Il semble que plus Mme Fahmy lui posait des questions, par exemple \u00e0 savoir pourquoi il prolongeait sa p\u00e9riode de probation, plus il devenait impatient. La ligne est mince entre le questionnement et le d\u00e9fi. Je crois aussi que le harc\u00e8lement obsessif et constant de Mme Fahmy envers S.M. (par exemple en lui envoyant de nombreux courriels le m\u00eame jour au sujet d'une question et en l'approchant en personne), alors que S.M. \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement occup\u00e9 et souvent absent du bureau pour des r\u00e9unions, \u00e9nervait S.M. Cependant, je ne vois aucun lien avec les motifs de distinction illicite all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. En effet, S.M. traitait avec des femmes d'autres d\u00e9partements de la GTAA, y compris Maria Maack, et avec des personnes de diff\u00e9rentes races et ethnies. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Maack selon lequel il n'y a eu aucune plainte contre S.M., \u00e0 l'exception de celle de Mme Fahmy, au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont il traitait les femmes ou les personnes de couleur et au sujet de ses relations avec ces personnes.\nF. All\u00e9gation no 3 : La question des accents et du niveau de communication des employ\u00e9s [75] Cette all\u00e9gation porte sur le motif de la race, de l'origine nationale ou ethnique et de la couleur. Mme Fahmy soutient qu'\u00e0 la fin de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2002, elle a entendu une conversation entre S.M. et D.M., dans laquelle S.M. aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] Je veux seulement des personnes qui peuvent communiquer \u00e0 un certain niveau. Elle a soutenu qu'il a dit qu'il [TRADUCTION] [devait] embaucher plus de responsables qui peuvent communiquer \u00e0 mon niveau. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ce commentaire portait seulement sur les employ\u00e9s de la TI qui n'\u00e9taient pas blancs et que S.M. n'aimait pas les accents. Je note que Mme Fahmy a reconnu qu'elle n'avait jamais r\u00e9ellement entendu S.M. dire qu'il n'aimait pas les accents, il avait seulement dit qu'il voulait [TRADUCTION] une meilleure communication. D.M., qui \u00e9tait la personne \u00e0 qui S.M. aurait cens\u00e9ment fait le commentaire, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il se souvenait avoir discut\u00e9 \u00e0 des moments distincts avec D.L. et S.M. au sujet de la question de savoir si Mme Fahmy pouvait communiquer [TRADUCTION] au niveau technique appropri\u00e9 pour les projets. Les discussions portaient sur Mme Fahmy et n'\u00e9taient pas de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ce qui, selon mon interpr\u00e9tation, signifie qu'elles ne portaient pas sur d'autres employ\u00e9s. Il n'a rien mentionn\u00e9 au sujet des accents. S.M. nie les all\u00e9gations de Mme Fahmy. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son seul commentaire portait sur le fait qu'il souhait que tous, y compris les clients, communiquent avec efficacit\u00e9 dans leurs courriels. Le commentaire n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec les accents. J'accepte son explication. Le t\u00e9moignage de S.M. est plus coh\u00e9rent que celui de D.M. Mme Fahmy a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que S.M. embauchait seulement des entrepreneurs blancs sans accents. Ce n'est pas le cas : par exemple, S.M. a r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 Ozgur Erkucuk, qui a un accent.\n[76] Dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de la GTAA \u00e0 la Commission, Mme Fahmy a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Deux employ\u00e9s ont dit qu'il avait critiqu\u00e9 nos accents. Ils \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9s. Elle n'a pas nomm\u00e9 ces personnes. Je n'accorde aucun poids \u00e0 cette preuve.\nG. All\u00e9gation no 4 : La cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 [77] Mme Fahmy soutient que le d\u00e9but de son emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9 de deux mois parce qu'on ne lui avait pas donn\u00e9 la bonne cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Elle soutient que des entrepreneurs blancs ont pu commencer \u00e0 travailler imm\u00e9diatement sans avoir la cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire (c'est \u00e0 dire B.M. et M.G.). Maria Maack et S.M. ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une exigence pour tous les employ\u00e9s de tous les d\u00e9partements de la GTAA, compte tenu de la nature du travail \u00e0 l'a\u00e9roport. Parfois, un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant pouvait commencer \u00e0 travailler imm\u00e9diatement, avec un acc\u00e8s restreint. Cela d\u00e9pendait des circonstances. Les employ\u00e9s devaient obtenir la cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. J'accepte cette explication et je ne vois pas de lien entre la pratique et un motif de distinction illicite.\nH. All\u00e9gation no 5 : La formation pour la passerelle de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et d'autres formations [78] La plaignante soutient qu'elle a demand\u00e9 une formation pour la passerelle de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour Internet, qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e, et que ce refus \u00e9tait syst\u00e9mique. Les entrepreneurs blancs avaient droit \u00e0 la formation, alors qu'elle et d'autres personnes de couleur n'y avaient pas droit. S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Param Singh, un analyste principal de r\u00e9seau, et Ozgur Erkucuk, un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein de descendance turque, avaient re\u00e7u la formation, parce qu'ils \u00e9taient respectivement le principal et le second pour la passerelle de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour Internet. Personne d'autre n'y avait acc\u00e8s. De plus, Mme Maack a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'employeur n'a pas l'obligation de fournir une formation \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 en probation, au del\u00e0 des exigences du poste. Aucune preuve ne m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sujet du fait que Mme Fahmy aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment des autres employ\u00e9s en probation, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, sous la supervision de S.M. S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la race n'avait jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 savoir qui obtenait de la formation. En effet, certaines des formations les plus dispendieuses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es \u00e0 des entrepreneurs ou \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s de couleur. J'accepte la preuve de la GTAA. Je ne rel\u00e8ve aucune diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable et certainement aucune diff\u00e9rence de traitement li\u00e9e \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite au sens de la LCDP.\nI. All\u00e9gation no 6 : S.M. a exclu la plaignante de r\u00e9unions [79] Mme Fahmy soutient que S.M. l'a exclue de r\u00e9unions. Elle a eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des exemples d\u00e9taill\u00e9s; son t\u00e9moignage visait la r\u00e9union du 30 janvier 2003. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle savait que M.G. allait \u00e0 des r\u00e9unions auxquelles elle aurait d\u00fb participer, parce qu'elle pouvait voir des notes au sujet de r\u00e9unions sur son bureau. Elle a fait valoir : [TRADUCTION] Des r\u00e9unions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues dans mon dos au sujet de Windows 2000, alors je ne sais pas quand [elles ont eu lieu]. Elle a reconnu, en contre interrogatoire, avoir envoy\u00e9 le courriel du 11 septembre 2003 \u00e0 D.M. (courriel qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve), qu'elle a envoy\u00e9 afin qu'il l'aide \u00e0 se souvenir de la r\u00e9union de Windows 2000 pour laquelle elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue : [TRADUCTION] Je dois l'utiliser comme exemple d'exclusion des r\u00e9unions de Windows 2000. D.M. a r\u00e9pondu que, du mieux qu'il puisse se souvenir, la r\u00e9union avait eu lieu [TRADUCTION] \u00e0 la toute fin janvier. Je conclus que la r\u00e9union du 30 janvier 2003 est la seule r\u00e9union pour laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue, pour des raisons l\u00e9gitimes qui n'\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la LCDP, comme je l'expliquerai ci dessous.\n[80] La r\u00e9union du 30 janvier a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par le patron de S.M., Gary Long, dans le but de discuter des probl\u00e8mes du premier syst\u00e8me W2000, y compris les pannes et les longues interruptions. Ces probl\u00e8mes pr\u00e9occupaient beaucoup la GTAA. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de S.M. selon lequel M. Long a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qui serait pr\u00e9sent. Comme la discussion ferait \u00e9tat de beaucoup de critiques au sujet de la conception du syst\u00e8me, on croyait que les deux principaux acteurs, D.M. et Mme Fahmy, ne devaient pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de A.W. selon lequel il ne souhaitait pas que la r\u00e9union tourne en affrontement verbal et en activit\u00e9 de bl\u00e2me. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy de s'occuper de la surveillance du centre et des besoins urgents des utilisateurs. Il fallait obligatoirement qu'une personne soit toujours pr\u00e9sente au centre de contr\u00f4le de la TI. D.M. n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 non plus. Malheureusement, il s'est impos\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Je suis convaincu que Mme Fahmy n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue de fa\u00e7on injuste de cette r\u00e9union, mais si c'\u00e9tait le cas, cette exclusion n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite. Mme Fahmy n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue d'autres r\u00e9unions et, si c'\u00e9tait le cas, qu'une telle pratique \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite.\nJ. All\u00e9gation no 7 : L'acc\u00e8s au r\u00e9seau de campus [81] La plaignante soutient qu'on lui a refus\u00e9 l'acc\u00e8s au r\u00e9seau de campus, mais que B.M. et M.G. ne l'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9. Cela l'emp\u00eachait parfois d'effectuer son travail. Tant S.M. qu'A.W. ont soutenu qu'elle n'avait pas besoin d'avoir acc\u00e8s au r\u00e9seau de campus pour effectuer son travail. S.M. a fait valoir qu'au d\u00e9part, B.M. et M.G. n'ont pas eu l'acc\u00e8s au r\u00e9seau non plus. Plus tard, ils ont obtenu cet acc\u00e8s, parce que S.M. d\u00e9m\u00e9nageait en f\u00e9vrier ou en mars sur le site du Terminal 1 et qu'ils avaient besoin d'un acc\u00e8s au r\u00e9seau de campus. M.G. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que B.M. travaillait sur le projet T1 et avait besoin d'un acc\u00e8s, et que M.G. \u00e9tait son rempla\u00e7ant lorsque B.M. \u00e9tait en vacances, etc., et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il avait aussi besoin d'un tel acc\u00e8s. [TRADUCTION] Nous voulions garder un contr\u00f4le serr\u00e9 sur l'acc\u00e8s au r\u00e9seau de campus. Ce besoin a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli tant par Bell Canada que par la GTAA. J'accepte l'explication de la GTAA et je ne rel\u00e8ve aucun lien \u00e0 l'article 7 de la LCDP pour cette all\u00e9gation.\nK. All\u00e9gation no 8 : La cl\u00e9 de l'armoire \u00e0 CD [82] Mme Fahmy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pendant un certain temps, l'armoire qui contenait les CD de tous les d\u00e9partements \u00e9tait verrouill\u00e9e et qu'elle n'avait pas de cl\u00e9, ce qui l'emp\u00eachait d'effectuer certaines de ses t\u00e2ches. Elle a \u00e9crit [TRADUCTION] Plus tard, [M.G.] a install\u00e9 un nouveau verrou sur l'armoire et il a donn\u00e9 la cl\u00e9 \u00e0 [B.M.], \u00e0 Calvin Ni [une personne de couleur] et il a gard\u00e9 une copie de la cl\u00e9 pour lui m\u00eame. S.M. a ni\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation, t\u00e9moignant : [TRADUCTION] Tout le monde avait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'armoire \u00e0 CD. Le responsable \u00e9tait Vishwa [Surajram, un administrateur de base de donn\u00e9es et une personne qui avait de l'anciennet\u00e9]. La cl\u00e9 \u00e9tait dans le tiroir du haut. Tout le monde le savait. Elle aurait pu y avoir acc\u00e8s. L'acc\u00e8s au r\u00e9seau de campus et la cl\u00e9 pour l'armoire \u00e0 CD sont des questions qui n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es avant l'audience. M\u00eame si Mme Fahmy ne savait pas que la cl\u00e9 se trouvait dans le tiroir du haut et \u00e9tait facilement accessible, je ne rel\u00e8ve aucun lien entre ce fait et l'article 7 de la LCDP.\nL. All\u00e9gation no 9 : Les commentaires \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel au sujet de Mme Fahmy lors de deux r\u00e9unions [83] Il s'agit de l'all\u00e9gation la plus s\u00e9rieuse. Elle provient de S.G., qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par la GTAA en janvier 2003. Il travaillait \u00e0 forfait pour MicroAge Consultants. Il \u00e9tait gestionnaire de projet technique et architecte principal des solutions pour le projet W2000 Enterprise. S.G. a avis\u00e9, en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, Mme Fahmy des commentaires en question, apr\u00e8s le cong\u00e9diement de celle ci.\n[84] L'all\u00e9gation que S.G. a faite au moment o\u00f9 il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente de celle qu'il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9e \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission, deux ans plus t\u00f4t. Il y a aussi des diff\u00e9rences entre son all\u00e9gation et ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e9crit dans ses courriels \u00e0 Mme Fahmy et les courriels qu'il a re\u00e7us de Mme Fahmy avant l'audience. Je tiens \u00e0 ajouter que les courriels provenaient de Mme Fahmy et demandaient \u00e0 S.G. de participer \u00e0 l'audience. Dans ses courriels, elle semble le guider au sujet de ce qu'il dirait, elle examine des questions pr\u00e9cises et sugg\u00e8re ce qu'il pourrait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces questions. Il lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il [TRADUCTION] dirait seulement la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et [TRADUCTION] je ne suis pas certain de pouvoir aider, parce que je n'ai pas beaucoup travaill\u00e9 avec vous et que je ne peux rien dire au sujet de vos capacit\u00e9s techniques.\n[85] En ce qui a trait aux commentaires \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel d\u00e9gradants, dans un courriel non dat\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse au courriel de Mme Fahmy, S.G. a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] [...] J'ai aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9go\u00fbt\u00e9 par son [S.M.] niveau de manque de professionnalisme et son attitude sexiste lorsqu'il parlait de vous. Je ne r\u00e9p\u00e9terai pas certaines des choses qu'il a dites lorsque je l'ai rencontr\u00e9 dans son bureau, mais je peux vous dire qu'entre ce qu'il a dit et ce que [M.G. et A.W. ont dit], leur discussion au sujet des femmes me d\u00e9go\u00fbtait. Bien qu'il e\u00fbt \u00e9crit [TRADUCTION] lorsqu'il parlait de vous, au sujet de Mme Fahmy, S.G. a ensuite \u00e9crit que la discussion \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] au sujet des femmes, et ne portait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur Mme Fahmy.\n[86] \u00c0 l'audience, S.G. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu deux incidents distincts, qui avaient tous deux eu lieu dans le bureau de S.M. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] il y en avait probablement plus, mais il ne pouvait s'en souvenir. Lors des deux r\u00e9unions en f\u00e9vrier ou mars 2003, S.M., A.W. et lui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents. Il n'\u00e9tait pas tout \u00e0 fait certain si M.G. \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l'une ou l'autre des r\u00e9unions. Je trouve \u00e9trange qu'il ne se souvienne pas plus de telles r\u00e9unions ou qu'il n'ait pas r\u00e9agi. Il dit qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] choqu\u00e9, et dans son courriel, il \u00e9crit qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9go\u00fbt\u00e9, pourtant il a presque accept\u00e9 ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit, parce qu'il n'a pas quitt\u00e9 la r\u00e9union et n'a pas fait de rapport \u00e0 ce sujet. Lors d'un incident au sujet d'un employ\u00e9 qui avait jou\u00e9 un tour sur l'ordinateur d'un autre employ\u00e9, pr\u00e9tendant qu'il \u00e9tait cette personne et qu'il \u00e9tait homosexuel, d\u00e8s qu'A.W. a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant, il a rapidement fait rapport \u00e0 S.M. Ce dernier a rapidement r\u00e9agi et a forc\u00e9 l'employ\u00e9 en faute \u00e0 s'excuser tant par \u00e9crit que verbalement.\n[87] S.G. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'une des deux r\u00e9unions, [TRADUCTION] [...] je me souviens que l'un des commentaires \u00e9tait qu'elle [Mme Fahmy] serait moins coinc\u00e9e si elle s'envoyait en l'air plus souvent [...] Ils n'ont pas utilis\u00e9 ce mot, mais j'utiliserai ce mot. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les termes \u00e9taient [TRADUCTION] plus grossiers. Le t\u00e9moin ne se souvient pas de la personne qui a fait le commentaire. Il croit qu'il y a eu des rires. \u00c0 l'autre r\u00e9union, S.G. soutient qu'un commentaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait au sujet de [TRADUCTION] la mesure dans laquelle elle [Mme Fahmy] faisait bien des fellations. Les mots exacts \u00e9taient plus crus. Une fois de plus, il croit qu'il y a eu des rires et il n'est pas certain de la personne qui a fait le commentaire.\n[88] Plus loin dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJe ne sais pas exactement qui a fait ces commentaires. Je suppose que la conversation a d\u00e9but\u00e9 avec [A.W.]. Je ne sais pas qui a fait les commentaires. Je suppose que \u00e7a a d\u00e9but\u00e9 avec [A.W.], mais je ne sais pas...Je suppose simplement en fonction du fait que chaque fois qu'il [A.W.] \u00e9tait l\u00e0, il y avait toujours une conversation qui portait d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre sur le sexe.\nComme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, la relation entre S.G. et A.W. \u00e9tait visc\u00e9rale. A.W. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avec franchise : [TRADUCTION] Nous nous d\u00e9testons.\n[89] S.G. a subi un contre interrogatoire sur de nombreuses d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures incompatibles. On lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il n'avait pas fait le m\u00eame r\u00e9cit \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateuse de la Commission, deux ans plus t\u00f4t, que celui qu'il a fait au Tribunal, alors que ses souvenirs \u00e9taient beaucoup plus frais deux ans plus t\u00f4t. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] [...] Je ne parle pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 des femmes en utilisant ce type de langage et, comme je l'ai dit, je ne savais pas qui avait fait le commentaire [...] Je reconnais aussi qu'il s'agissait d'une entrevue t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec une femme \u00e0 qui je n'avais jamais parl\u00e9 et je ne savais m\u00eame pas qu'elle travaillait pour la Commission des droits de la personne [...] Bien, elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 et elle a dit qu'elle travaillait pour la Commission des droits de la personne, mais je ne tiens rien pour acquis par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Mme Rusak a alors r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Alors vous lui avez donn\u00e9 tous ces renseignements au sujet de la GTAA et au sujet de [S.M.]. Vous dites maintenant que vous avez parl\u00e9 \u00e0 une femme et que vous ne saviez pas qu'elle \u00e9tait [une enqu\u00eateuse de la Commission], vous pensiez qu'elle pouvait l'\u00eatre, mais peut \u00eatre pas, et vous lui avez simplement tout racont\u00e9? [...] Mais vous lui avez parl\u00e9. Vous dites que vous n'utilisez pas d'obsc\u00e9nit\u00e9s. Vous avez dit [TRADUCTION] une bonne baise. C'est une obsc\u00e9nit\u00e9 [...] S.G. a reconnu avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 plus cru avec l'enqu\u00eateuse de la Commission. Mme Rusak a aussi fait avouer au t\u00e9moin qu'il n'avait rien dit \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateuse de la Commission au sujet de fellation.\n[90] D'autres incoh\u00e9rences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es dans l'\u00e9change suivant entre Mme Rusak et le t\u00e9moin :\nQ. Vous ciblez une personne, vous ne prenez pas une approche g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e. Vous ne dites pas [A.W.] a pu dire cela. Vous n'avez jamais dit [\u00e0 Mme Fahmy] En passant, [A.W.], d\u00e8s qu'il est l\u00e0, la conversation tire toujours vers ce sujet. Vous ne lui avez jamais dit \u00e7a?\nR. Non, probablement pas.\nQ. Et vous avez d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [S.M.] a dit certaines choses, mais certainement pas de la fa\u00e7on dont vous les avez pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es hier, lorsque vous avez dit que deux commentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment au sujet de la plaignante, mais vous ne vous souvenez pas de la personne qui a fait ces commentaires. C'est diff\u00e9rent, n'est ce pas?\nR. C'est diff\u00e9rent. Mais comme je l'ai dit, c'\u00e9tait il y a quatre ans.\n[91] Le t\u00e9moignage qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de est remarquablement invraisemblable. Je ne lui accorde aucun poids. Il est surprenant aussi que, si ces commentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, il n'a pas quitt\u00e9 le bureau, n'a pas fait de plainte \u00e0 ce sujet et a seulement avis\u00e9 Mme Fahmy apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part de la GTAA. La d\u00e9claration a aussi eu lieu apr\u00e8s que S.G. eut mis fin \u00e0 sa relation avec la GTAA et avec MicroAge (pour qui il travaillait \u00e0 forfait), et il \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re envers la GTAA (ainsi qu'envers A.W. et S.M.). En plus du t\u00e9moignage de A.W. au sujet de sa relation avec S.G., j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de S.M. selon lequel sa relation avec S.G. \u00e9tait mauvaise et que ce dernier \u00e9tait difficile \u00e0 vivre.\n[92] En contre interrogatoire, S.G. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au moment o\u00f9 il a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateuse de la Commission, il croyait que c'\u00e9tait S.M. qui avait fait les commentaires. [TRADUCTION] Maintenant, des ann\u00e9es plus tard, je ne sais pas. Mme Rusak lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la situation comme ceci : [TRADUCTION] \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, vous avez dit que c'\u00e9tait [S.M.]. Par la suite, vous avez essay\u00e9 d'\u00e9largir le champ, parce que la plaignante vous a dit que le d\u00e9cideur \u00e9tait [A.W.], et non [S.M.]. Il a r\u00e9pondu [TRADUCTION] Vous venez de m'apprendre quelque chose [...] Je peux dire que [M.G.] \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 et silencieux pendant ce genre de conversations [...] C'est pourquoi j'ai dit que je ne sais pas si c'\u00e9tait [S.M.], je ne sais pas si c'\u00e9tait [A.W.]. Je peux vous dire que ce n'\u00e9tait pas [M.G.].\n[93] S.M., A.W. et M.G. ont tout simplement ni\u00e9 ces commentaires. S.M. et A.W. ne pouvaient pas se souvenir si les deux r\u00e9unions entre les quatre hommes avaient m\u00eame eu lieu. On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M.G. s'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9union avec S.G., S.M. et A.W. Il a r\u00e9pondu [TRADUCTION] Possiblement... certainement au moins une fois. Lorsqu'on a demand\u00e9 en contre interrogatoire s'il \u00e9tait d'avis que de tels commentaires seraient offensants, A.W. a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Non seulement sexistes, mais aussi disgracieux et r\u00e9pugnants. Chacun d'entre eux a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient jamais entendu de commentaires sexistes ou observ\u00e9 de comportements sexistes de la part des autres. S.G., A.W. et M.G. ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9s et contre interrog\u00e9s au sujet de ces deux incidents. S.M. a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9, mais pas contre interrog\u00e9, au sujet des deux pr\u00e9tendues r\u00e9unions dans son bureau. J'ai aussi entendu des t\u00e9moignages au sujet du fait que S.M. ne fait jamais de blagues. M. Surajram a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que non seulement il n'avait jamais entendu S.M. faire des commentaires sexistes ou racistes ou agir d'une telle mani\u00e8re, mais il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais m\u00eame entendu S.M. faire une blague. A.W. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Je ne sais m\u00eame pas si [S.M.] sait m\u00eame comment raconter une blague. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s troubl\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage de S.G. selon lequel il \u00e9tait courant, lorsque A.W. \u00e9tait dans les parages, que les conversations d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e8rent en plaisanteries \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel. Compte tenu des incoh\u00e9rences du t\u00e9moignage de S.G. au sujet de ces incidents et de sa mauvaise relation avec A.W., je conclus qu'A.W. n'a pas fait ces commentaires.\n[94] Compte tenu des conclusions que j'ai tir\u00e9es ci dessus et de mes commentaires pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents au sujet de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de S.G., et du d\u00e9ni sans \u00e9quivoque de S.M., A.W. et M.G. (v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 en contre interrogatoire), je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 conclure, sur le seul fondement du t\u00e9moignage de S.G., que de tels commentaires \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel d\u00e9gradants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits au sujet de Mme Fahmy lors de ces deux incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\nM. All\u00e9gation no 10 : Son rendement de travail \u00e9tait bon : son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait discriminatoire [95] Mme Fahmy soutient que son rendement de travail \u00e9tait bon et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e parce qu'elle est une femme de couleur d'origine \u00e9gyptienne. La GTAA r\u00e9pond en soutenant que bien que son rendement \u00e9tait parfois satisfaisant, il n'\u00e9tait pas constamment d'une assez bonne qualit\u00e9 pour qu'elle garde son emploi.\n[96] La d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi a officiellement \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par Gary Long, le patron de S.M. Comme il \u00e9tait un entrepreneur, S.M. ne pouvait pas officiellement embaucher ou cong\u00e9dier quelqu'un. N\u00e9anmoins, il a sign\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation de rendement et la lettre de cong\u00e9diement de Mme Fahmy. Il a recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Long qu'il soit mis fin \u00e0 son emploi sous probation le 1er mai 2003 - 10 mois apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la GTAA. S.M. a dit qu'il avait consult\u00e9 A.W. S.M. se trouvait ailleurs, au Terminal 1, la majorit\u00e9 du temps \u00e0 partir de mars 2003. S.M. a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9 par les plaintes qu'il avait re\u00e7ues le 29 avril et le 1er mai de M.G. et B.M. respectivement au sujet de son travail. Il \u00e9tait aussi pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 au sujet du fait que Vishwa Surajram, une personne qui avait de l'anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 la GTAA, et Lynn Child, une administratrice de syst\u00e8mes, s'\u00e9taient plaints au sujet du travail de Mme Fahmy et ne voulaient plus qu'elle travaille sur leur \u00e9quipement \u00e0 l'avenir. S.M. \u00e9tait aussi pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 au sujet du fait que Mme Fahmy prenait les tickets HEAT les plus faciles et en prenait moins que les autres employ\u00e9s.\n[97] A.W. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, selon lui, [TRADUCTION] le fait d\u00e9clencheur \u00e9tait que des employ\u00e9s ne voulaient pas que Mme Fahmy travaille sur leur \u00e9quipement ou fasse du travail pour eux, les probl\u00e8mes de demande de changement (DC) et le fait que l'inventaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus long \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser que pr\u00e9vu. [TRADUCTION] J'ai avis\u00e9 mon superviseur [S.M.] de ces probl\u00e8mes. A.W. nie qu'on lui a demand\u00e9 de concocter des motifs pour justifier son cong\u00e9diement. A.W. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Si cela avait le cas, j'aurais cherch\u00e9 des poux partout. Elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en probation et nous ne voyions pas d'am\u00e9lioration. Pendant la r\u00e9union de cong\u00e9diement du 1er mai 2003, S.M. a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy qu'elle avait fait du bon travail, mais que le travail n'\u00e9tait pas constamment de qualit\u00e9 satisfaisante. De plus, il lui a mentionn\u00e9 que ses capacit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de Microsoft Exchange \u00e9taient faibles. La lettre de cong\u00e9diement du 1er mai pr\u00e9cisait en partie :\n[TRADUCTION]\nBien que nous ayons remarqu\u00e9 une certaine am\u00e9lioration pendant un mois, cette am\u00e9lioration n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 constante et n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 continue. Nous avons examin\u00e9 l'ensemble de votre travail du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2002 \u00e0 aujourd'hui et c'est avec regret que nous constatons que vous ne satisfaites pas aux exigences du poste, parce que vous avez montr\u00e9 de faibles comp\u00e9tences techniques et peu, ou pas, de compr\u00e9hension de votre r\u00f4le et de vos responsabilit\u00e9s.\n[98] La GTAA a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que Mme Fahmy avait fait du bon travail. J'ai examin\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui appuyaient ce fait : par exemple les courriels de S.M. \u00e0 Mme Fahmy, ainsi que les courriels de clients qui la remerciaient pour son travail. Le probl\u00e8me avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame : l'inconstance. \u00c0 l'exception de la p\u00e9riode d'un mois du 12 novembre au 17 d\u00e9cembre 2002, lorsque la deuxi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re \u00e9valuation officielle a paru, dans laquelle ses am\u00e9liorations \u00e9taient not\u00e9es, la GTAA soutient que son rendement n'\u00e9tait pas constamment de niveau satisfaisant. S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation de rendement en avril 2003 (qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve), mais qu'elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Fahmy, parce que la d\u00e9cision de la cong\u00e9dier a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise \u00e0 la fin avril.\n(i) \u00c9tait elle comp\u00e9tente et qualifi\u00e9e pour effectuer le travail? [99] S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] sur papier [elle \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e]; en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, en fonction des r\u00e9sultats [sur une p\u00e9riode de dix mois], elle n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9e. Je tire la m\u00eame conclusion. Sur papier elle avait les qualifications requises pour \u00eatre analyste de r\u00e9seau \u00e0 la GTAA. Elle a obtenu un dipl\u00f4me en g\u00e9nie de l'Universit\u00e9 du Caire, elle avait des certifications de Microsoft et un certain nombre d'ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine de la TI au Canada (ind\u00e9pendamment de mes conclusions au sujet de fausses affirmations dans son curriculum vitae). \u00c9videmment, la GTAA \u00e9tait du m\u00eame avis : elle l'a embauch\u00e9e. Je conclus aussi que Mme Fahmy a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, alors qu'elle travaillait \u00e0 la GTAA, un certain niveau de connaissances et de comp\u00e9tences techniques. Cependant, la comp\u00e9tence comprend d'autres facteurs, notamment la capacit\u00e9 de travailler de fa\u00e7on constante \u00e0 un niveau efficace. De plus, travailler et faire son travail comprennent non seulement les connaissances techniques, mais aussi une attitude positive et une approche coop\u00e9rative envers son superviseur et ses coll\u00e8gues. Dans ces domaines, elle avait des lacunes. \u00c0 ce sujet, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de A.W. selon lequel il a eu une conversation avec Mme Fahmy dans la caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria \u00e0 la fin de janvier 2003, au sujet de son [TRADUCTION] comportement autocratique, \u00e0 l'occasion de laquelle il l'a incit\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre [TRADUCTION] plus efficace et \u00e0 moins argumenter. Il a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Elle voulait travailler \u00e0 plus de projets. Elle voulait \u00eatre responsable de tout, et que les autres employ\u00e9s s'occupent des travaux anodins [...] Je lui ai dit qu'en s'entendant mieux avec ses coll\u00e8gues, elle serait plus efficace. Mme Fahmy nie que cette conversation a eu lieu.\n[100] En fonction du t\u00e9moignage que j'ai entendu de S.M. et de la preuve documentaire que j'ai examin\u00e9e, je conclus que S.M. a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement avis\u00e9 Mme Fahmy que son travail n'\u00e9tait pas constamment de niveau satisfaisant. Cela ne comprenait pas seulement les probl\u00e8mes techniques, tels que les probl\u00e8mes de DC et les \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers manqu\u00e9s, mais aussi les pr\u00e9occupations au niveau de son attitude (par exemple, l'incident du 13 novembre dans le bureau de S.M., le fait que Mme Fahmy d\u00e9fiait toujours D.M. et S.M.), ainsi que le fait qu'il fallait trop lui consacrer de temps sur le plan de la supervision et de la gestion. Mme Maack a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s difficile. S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais eu \u00e0 passer autant de temps \u00e0 s'occuper d'un employ\u00e9, depuis Mme Fahmy. [TRADUCTION] Elle n\u00e9cessitait plus d'attention sur le plan de la gestion que ce qu'il est normal pour un employ\u00e9 en probation. J'ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t dans mes motifs mon point de vue au sujet du fait que certains de ses comportements manquaient clairement de professionnalisme.\n[101] La preuve montre clairement, et cela ressort de la lettre de cong\u00e9diement, que Mme Fahmy ne comprenait pas son r\u00f4le et ses responsabilit\u00e9s. Les courriels entre Mme Fahmy et S.M. le d\u00e9montrent, y compris le courriel de S.M. dat\u00e9 du 12 novembre 2002, dans lequel il lui a rappel\u00e9 ses responsabilit\u00e9s, ainsi que le courriel de Mme Fahmy qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse de S.M.\n[102] Je conclus aussi que le point de vue irr\u00e9aliste que Mme Fahmy entretenait quant \u00e0 son rendement a contribu\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me.. Dans un courriel qu'elle a \u00e9crit au pr\u00e9sident Turpen de la GTAA, dat\u00e9 du 4 mai 2003, elle a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Apr\u00e8s cela [la prolongation de sa p\u00e9riode de probation]7 , il [S.M.] a cess\u00e9 de me donner des projets, parce qu'il trouvait que j'avais trop de succ\u00e8s et qu'il avait re\u00e7u beaucoup de courriels de clients qui me remerciaient pour mon bon travail. Dans une lettre, elle \u00e9crit que S.M. [TRADUCTION] s'inqui\u00e9tait parce que j'avais trop de succ\u00e8s. Elle a aussi \u00e9crit que son travail \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] parfait. Il est \u00e9vident que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas. M\u00eame si j'accepte la moiti\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations d'erreurs techniques dans son travail et que je ne tiens pas compte de son comportement inappropri\u00e9 envers S.M., elle n'avait certainement pas trop de succ\u00e8s et son travail \u00e9tait loin d'\u00eatre parfait. S'ajoutait \u00e0 cette \u00e9valuation de son travail son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter les directives de ses superviseurs de fa\u00e7on constante. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de S.M. selon lequel D.M. s'est plaint de nombreuses fois au sujet de ce qui peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'insubordination et de d\u00e9fi constant de la part de Mme Fahmy envers l'autorit\u00e9 et les d\u00e9cisions de D.M. Cela est cr\u00e9dible, compte tenu de son courriel \u00e0 S.M., dat\u00e9 du 6 septembre 2002, dans lequel elle a fait une critique v\u00e9h\u00e9mente du travail de D.M. Dans le compte rendu de la r\u00e9union du 13 novembre (\u00e0 laquelle S.M., Mme Maack et Mme Erbiceanu des ressources humaines, Mme Fahmy et le repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat Mark Daniels ont particip\u00e9), \u00e0 la page 4, Mme Maack a averti Mme Fahmy qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas la responsable du projet : D.M. \u00e9tait l'architecte, et Mme Fahmy n'\u00e9tait pas une analyste principale de r\u00e9seau, elle \u00e9tait une analyste de r\u00e9seau. Les faits qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent font partie des raisons pour lesquelles la GTAA a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 Mme Fahmy : elle ne comprenait pas son r\u00f4le et ses responsabilit\u00e9s.\n[103] Enfin, bien que je conclue que Mme Fahmy a des connaissances techniques, de la formation et des \u00e9tudes en mati\u00e8re de TI, son comportement \u00e9tait loin d'\u00eatre professionnel, en particulier envers S.M. Premi\u00e8rement, j'ai entendu des t\u00e9moignages selon lesquels elle suivait S.M. \u00e0 la trace en lui demandant de la rencontrer au sujet de la mauvaise \u00e9valuation de rendement du 8 novembre, bien qu'une r\u00e9union de suivi e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue dans un avenir proche. Mme Fahmy a r\u00e9pondu en r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de la GTAA \u00e0 la Commission : [TRADUCTION] Il s'est rendu \u00e0 son bureau et je l'ai suivi. Ensuite, j'ai insist\u00e9 pour savoir si [M.G.] serait mon rempla\u00e7ant, je ne pouvais pas laisser tomber8. Son insistance a atteint son point culminant le 13 novembre 2002, lorsqu'elle s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le bureau de S.M. et qu'elle a ferm\u00e9 la porte, qu'il a rouvert la porte, qu'elle l'a ferm\u00e9e, qu'il l'a rouverte, etc. Il a d\u00fb lever le ton et lui ordonner de sortir de son bureau. S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait eu peur, qu'il ne savait pas ce qu'elle \u00e9tait capable de faire ou de dire. Il a imm\u00e9diatement appel\u00e9 sa femme et les ressources humaines, demandant \u00e0 rencontrer le vice pr\u00e9sident des ressources humaines. Cette rencontre l'avait vraiment boulevers\u00e9 et l'a affect\u00e9 par la suite. Je reconnais que la plaignante \u00e9tait stress\u00e9e par sa mauvaise \u00e9valuation de rendement. Tout de m\u00eame, un tel comportement n'\u00e9tait pas professionnel. Je conclus que cet incident a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9gradation de la confiance entre S.M. et Mme Fahmy.\n[104] De plus, Mme Fahmy avait \u00e9crit des courriels \u00e0 S.M. dans lesquels elle disait vouloir se [TRADUCTION] rapprocher de lui et le respecter. Dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 4 octobre 2002, elle a \u00e9crit, entre autres : [TRADUCTION] S'il vous pla\u00eet, souriez et passez une belle fin de semaine. Je ne vous d\u00e9fiais pas, mais je vous aime tellement et je tiens tellement \u00e0 vous en tant que gestionnaire. Dans un courriel du 13 novembre, elle a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Vous ne m'avez pas permis de vous parler. Je voulais que vous m'aidiez \u00e0 mieux me sentir. Je refuse de croire que vous ne voulez pas le faire. Comme c'\u00e9tait le cas pour l'interaction susmentionn\u00e9e, il s'agit d'un comportement inacceptable dans n'importe quel lieu de travail. Comme elle travaillait au Canada depuis 13 ans, Mme Fahmy aurait d\u00fb le savoir. Ces actions ont entra\u00een\u00e9 une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de sa relation de travail avec S.M. et, \u00e0 mon avis, m\u00eame si S.M. ne l'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment all\u00e9gu\u00e9, cela a endommag\u00e9 sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 ses yeux.\n[105] En fonction de la preuve orale et de la preuve documentaire, dont je ferai \u00e9tat ci dessous, je conclus que la GTAA a fourni une explication raisonnable non discriminatoire pour ses actions :\n(ii) L'inventaire de l'\u00e9quipement [106] A.W. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 la GTAA en janvier 2003, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 choqu\u00e9 d'apprendre qu'il n'existait pas d'inventaire juste et \u00e0 jour de tout l'\u00e9quipement de la TI. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'un inventaire est essentiel pour le fonctionnement de tout d\u00e9partement de la TI et pour l'organisation en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il a attribu\u00e9 la compilation de l'inventaire \u00e0 plusieurs personnes, y compris Mme Fahmy. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les autres personnes ont termin\u00e9 leurs parties beaucoup plus rapidement que Mme Fahmy. En effet, il devait constamment s'informer pour savoir \u00e0 quel moment son travail serait termin\u00e9. Elle a envoy\u00e9 un courriel le 18 mars 2003 dans lequel elle d\u00e9clarait que l'inventaire \u00e9tait termin\u00e9. Il a ensuite appris que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas et lui a demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler la question. Elle l'a fait. Il a soutenu que non seulement l'inventaire \u00e9tait incomplet, mais qu'elle avait eu besoin de beaucoup plus de temps que les autres pour le pr\u00e9parer. Pourtant, il ne s'agissait pas d'une t\u00e2che techniquement difficile. J'ai aussi entendu son t\u00e9moignage au sujet du fait qu'il souhaitait que les employ\u00e9s fassent un inventaire physique et qu'ils ne restent pas simplement \u00e0 leur ordinateur. Elle ne l'a pas fait. De plus, apr\u00e8s que Mme Fahmy eut \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e de la GTAA, A.W. a remarqu\u00e9 qu'il y avait d'autres erreurs dans l'inventaire que Mme Fahmy avait effectu\u00e9. Il a soutenu [TRADUCTION] Il \u00e9tait tellement inexact [...] qu'il ne pouvait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 et a d\u00fb \u00eatre refait9. A.W. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il devait demander \u00e0 Mme Fahmy plusieurs fois par semaine si l'inventaire avan\u00e7ait. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle ne faisait pas l'inventaire, il a r\u00e9pondu [TRADUCTION] j'\u00e9tais d'avis qu'elle n'avait pas envie de le faire. J'accepte la preuve susmentionn\u00e9e. J'ajouterais qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident, dans le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Fahmy, qu'elle ne souhaitait pas faire ce travail; elle \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il s'agissait d'une t\u00e2che avilissante qui ne repr\u00e9sentait pas son expertise. Je ne crois pas que les lacunes dans l'inventaire et le d\u00e9faut de Mme Fahmy de respecter les d\u00e9lais font \u00e9tat de sa comp\u00e9tence technique. Je conclus plut\u00f4t qu'elle n'avait simplement pas envie de faire l'inventaire. Une fois de plus, il s'agit d'une mauvaise compr\u00e9hension de son r\u00f4le et de ses responsabilit\u00e9s.\n(iii) Les \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers techniques non respect\u00e9s [107] J'ai entendu le t\u00e9moignage de plusieurs t\u00e9moins au sujet des \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers techniques que Mme Fahmy n'avait pas respect\u00e9s. Mme Fahmy nie qu'elle n'a pas respect\u00e9 les \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers. J'ai examin\u00e9 attentivement la preuve de vive voix et le document qui pr\u00e9cisait chacun des \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers rat\u00e9s. En particulier, je note que D.M. a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une liste pour S.M., \u00e0 la demande de ce dernier, que S.M. a ensuite envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Fahmy. D.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il croyait que plusieurs personnes avaient contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de la liste des \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers non respect\u00e9s, et que la liste pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par S.M. et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] probablement un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de ces points. D.M. soutient que S.M. lui aurait dit de [TRADUCTION] l'inventer, [TRADUCTION] utilisez votre imagination si n\u00e9cessaire. Je n'accepte pas cet argument. De plus D.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'a rien fabriqu\u00e9; la liste qu'il a pr\u00e9par\u00e9e \u00e9tait exacte et juste. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] [...] J'ai mon propre code moral \u00e0 suivre et cela ne comprend pas le fait d'inventer des renseignements qui ne sont pas enti\u00e8rement v\u00e9ridiques. J'ai cru D.M. lorsqu'il a soutenu qu'il avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 la liste avec honn\u00eatet\u00e9.\n[108] Le t\u00e9moignage de D.M., qui \u00e9tait le t\u00e9moin de Mme Fahmy, montrait clairement qu'il n'appr\u00e9ciait pas la GTAA et S.M. en particulier. Il y avait eu une s\u00e9paration mutuelle le 15 f\u00e9vrier. D.M. \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s hostile envers l'avocate de la GTAA pendant le contre interrogatoire; il a essentiellement menac\u00e9 de la poursuivre. En effet, apr\u00e8s des heures de contre interrogatoire et alors qu'il lui restait des pages de questions \u00e0 poser, Mme Rusak a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 son contre interrogatoire et de me permettre de tirer mes propres conclusions au sujet de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin. Il suffit de dire qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas un t\u00e9moin tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible. De plus, je crois qu'il essayait de donner la meilleure interpr\u00e9tation possible \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage ou de le pr\u00e9senter sous son meilleur jour pour favoriser Mme Fahmy.\n[109] D.M. a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre interrog\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail au sujet de chacun des douze points particuliers de la liste des [TRADUCTION] \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers non respect\u00e9s. M\u00eame s'il essayait de soutenir le mieux possible Mme Fahmy, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que quatre des douze \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers non respect\u00e9s relevaient de sa responsabilit\u00e9; d'autres relevaient en partie de sa responsabilit\u00e9, pour certains, elle \u00e9tait responsable de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation des t\u00e2ches, et certains autres points pouvaient ne pas relever de sa responsabilit\u00e9. M\u00eame si j'accepte son t\u00e9moignage que ce ne sont pas tous les points qui engageaient sa responsabilit\u00e9, Mme Fahmy avait quand m\u00eame omis de respecter beaucoup d'\u00e9ch\u00e9anciers, comme les t\u00e9moignages de D.M. et S.M. le soulignent. Je note que S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s la rencontre qu'il a eue avec Mme Fahmy, elle lui a envoy\u00e9 un certain nombre de courriels le corrigeant sur seulement trois des douze \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers non respect\u00e9s; elle n'a pas contest\u00e9 les autres neuf ou dix points. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il croyait que les douze points relevaient de sa responsabilit\u00e910 . Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je d\u00e9termine le nombre exact d'\u00e9ch\u00e9anciers techniques non respect\u00e9s. Il suffit de dire que je conclus qu'elle n'a pas respect\u00e9 un certain nombre d'\u00e9ch\u00e9anciers.\n(iv) Protocole de gestion du changement du DC [110] S.M. a \u00e9tabli un nouveau syst\u00e8me pour la gestion des changements aux serveurs, etc., dans le d\u00e9partement de la TI. Il l'a fait pour des raisons de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. [TRADUCTION] Si ce n'est pas fait correctement, le syst\u00e8me au complet peut tomber en panne et cela augmente les risques. Il a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 son \u00e9quipe dans lequel il pr\u00e9cisait la nouvelle proc\u00e9dure, y compris le besoin de remplir une demande de changement (DC) qui devait \u00eatre approuv\u00e9e par lui avant que les changements soient effectu\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve \u00e0 ce sujet, je conclus que Mme Fahmy n'a pas, de fa\u00e7on constante, respect\u00e9 le protocole appropri\u00e9 de DC. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de A.W. selon lequel elle a d\u00fb obtenir une formation individuelle \u00e0 ce sujet : [TRADUCTION] Elle a eu besoin de supervision jusqu'au jour o\u00f9 elle est partie. Elle a aussi assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la formation de groupe donn\u00e9e par Jeff Gardiner que les autres employ\u00e9s ont re\u00e7ue en mars 2003. A.W. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les autres employ\u00e9s et entrepreneurs n'\u00e9prouvaient pas de probl\u00e8mes de ce genre quant au respect du protocole de DC. S.M. a soutenu que Mme Fahmy n'avait jamais sembl\u00e9 ma\u00eetriser le formulaire et le processus de DC. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Elle \u00e9tait incapable de suivre la proc\u00e9dure, qui tenait sur une seule page; il s'agit de trucs de d\u00e9butants, qui ne sont pas difficiles. Apr\u00e8s avoir introduit la politique, je devais continuer \u00e0 soutenir une ressource. De plus, elle cr\u00e9ait de la confusion au sujet de la politique aupr\u00e8s des autres employ\u00e9s. J'accepte leurs t\u00e9moignages. Cependant, je suppose que son probl\u00e8me n'\u00e9tait pas qu'elle ne pouvait pas ma\u00eetriser ou comprendre le formulaire ou la proc\u00e9dure. Elle comprenait, elle est une personne intelligente. Le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait qu'elle ne voulait pas suivre la proc\u00e9dure. C'est pourquoi elle ne se conformait pas toujours aux exigences. Une fois de plus, tout revient \u00e0 la question de son attitude et de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre constamment les directives. Je conclus aussi qu'elle ne voulait pas accepter que son r\u00f4le comprenait parfois le fait d'effectuer des t\u00e2ches administratives et modestes.\n(v) Tickets HEAT [111] Le syst\u00e8me de tickets HEAT comprenait le renvoi des probl\u00e8mes techniques par les employ\u00e9s de la GTAA au [TRADUCTION] service de d\u00e9pannage. Mme Fahmy et les autres employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient responsables de r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes d'ordinateur et les autres probl\u00e8mes de TI des employ\u00e9s dans la file d'attente HEAT, au troisi\u00e8me niveau de soutien. S.M., A.W. et M.G. ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de probl\u00e8mes de rendement de Mme Fahmy \u00e0 ce sujet. M.G. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plaignante r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 moins de tickets (demandes des utilisateurs de r\u00e9gler un probl\u00e8me) que B.M. ou lui m\u00eame. De plus, il a soutenu qu'elle choisissait les tickets auxquels elle r\u00e9pondait. [TRADUCTION] Marie prenait les tickets les plus faciles qui seraient r\u00e9solus rapidement; ceux qui semblaient plus longs, elle n'y touchait pas. S.M. a corrobor\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M.G. S.M. a soutenu qu'il s'inqui\u00e9tait de la quantit\u00e9 et du choix s\u00e9lectif de Mme Fahmy pour les tickets les moins difficiles du point de vue technique. [B.M.] a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 trois ou quatre fois plus de tickets que Mme Fahmy l'a fait en un mois [...] J'ai envoy\u00e9 un courriel au d\u00e9partement dans lequel j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 tous de faire leur part du travail. C'\u00e9tait une p\u00e9riode tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9e. J'ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy, elle a fronc\u00e9 les sourcils et elle a dit Je le ferai. Je ferai attention. La plaignante a ni\u00e9 qu'elle avait pris des tickets HEAT plus faciles et qu'elle en avait pris moins. J'accepte la preuve de la GTAA \u00e0 ce propos.\n(vi) La formation de M.G. pour l'outil de transfert Aelita [112] Pour la question de sa comp\u00e9tence et de son rendement professionnel inconstant, la GTAA a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves selon lesquelles on lui a demand\u00e9 deux fois de former M.G. pour l'outil de transfert Aelita avant qu'elle le fasse. Et m\u00eame lorsqu'elle l'a fait, M.G. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Elle ne m'a montr\u00e9 que le niveau de base, elle ne m'a pas montr\u00e9 comment l'utiliser. Et elle \u00e9tait la seule qui savait comment l'utiliser. Mme Fahmy nie cette all\u00e9gation. Je conclus que la preuve de la GTAA \u00e0 ce sujet est exacte.\n(vii) La plainte de Lynn Child [113] Lynn Child est une gestionnaire des syst\u00e8mes de la GTAA. S.M. et A.W. ont soutenu qu'elle se plaignait du travail de Mme Fahmy lorsqu'elle avait d\u00fb monter des serveurs pour elle. Mme Child et Vishwa Surajram sont deux des exemples que la GTAA a donn\u00e9s afin de d\u00e9montrer que les clients ne voulaient plus que Mme Fahmy r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 leurs besoins, en raison des probl\u00e8mes de rendement au travail.\n[114] Mme Child a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'un nouveau serveur devait \u00eatre configur\u00e9 et install\u00e9 pour le nouveau domaine Windows 2000. Elle a dit que Mme Fahmy [TRADUCTION] a fini par le faire. Cependant, Mme Child avait eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir des renseignements de Mme Fahmy au sujet de l'\u00e9tat du travail et ce travail avait pris excessivement longtemps \u00e0 \u00eatre termin\u00e9. [TRADUCTION] J'ai d\u00fb descendre chaque jour pour savoir o\u00f9 nous en \u00e9tions avec nos serveurs [...] \u00c7a devait \u00eatre la t\u00e2che de Marie, pas la mienne [...] Lorsque Roger s'en est m\u00eal\u00e9, les choses ont avanc\u00e9 et le probl\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9. Elle soutient qu'elle n'a pas eu de probl\u00e8me semblable depuis avec une autre personne de la TI de la GTAA. Elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 S.M. de ne plus permettre \u00e0 Mme Fahmy de travailler sur l'un de leurs projets. Mme Child a reconnu que Mme Fahmy avait bien travaill\u00e9 pour elle \u00e0 nouveau : [TRADUCTION] Probablement pour de petites choses, comme le red\u00e9marrage.\n[115] En contre interrogatoire, Mme MacKinnon a laiss\u00e9 entendre au t\u00e9moin qu'il y avait pu y avoir un probl\u00e8me de communication. Le retard avait pu \u00eatre caus\u00e9 par l'impression qu'avait Mme Fahmy que l'un de ses coll\u00e8gues avait command\u00e9 le c\u00e2ble de r\u00e9seau SAN qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire. M\u00eame si c'\u00e9tait le cas, Mme Fahmy \u00e9tait responsable, \u00e0 titre de personne ressource pour Mme Child. C'\u00e9tait \u00e0 Mme Fahmy d'aller de l'avant et d'aviser Mme Child de l'\u00e9tat des travaux.\n(viii) La plainte de Vishwa Surajram [116] J'ai entendu le t\u00e9moignage selon lequel M. Surajram \u00e9tait une personne qui avait de l'anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 la GTAA, un administrateur de banques de donn\u00e9es qui travaillait \u00e0 la GTAA depuis sept ans. Il \u00e9tait l'un des principaux clients des Op\u00e9rations de syst\u00e8mes de la TI \u00e0 la GTAA. A.W. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le domaine de travail de M. Surajram comptait pour la moiti\u00e9 du travail au niveau des syst\u00e8mes. M. Surajram a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy en f\u00e9vrier ou en mars 2003 de construire un serveur. Elle l'a fait. Peu de temps plus tard, des probl\u00e8mes ont surgi. Il lui a demand\u00e9 de lui en construire un nouveau et elle l'a fait. Le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me s'est produit. Il a alors demand\u00e9 \u00e0 A.W. d'attribuer la t\u00e2che \u00e0 quelqu'un d'autre dans le d\u00e9partement pour une troisi\u00e8me et, comme il l'esp\u00e9rait, derni\u00e8re fois. M. Surajram ne voulait pas que Mme Fahmy s'occupe de la troisi\u00e8me construction. B.M. a construit le serveur avec succ\u00e8s.\n[117] On a aussi pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 M. Surajram au sujet des comp\u00e9tences techniques de Mme Fahmy. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Fahmy avait eu besoin d'une ou deux semaines pour les deux constructions de serveur, alors que cela n'aurait d\u00fb prendre que d'une demi journ\u00e9e \u00e0 une journ\u00e9e. C'est le temps qu'il avait fallu \u00e0 B.M., comme l'a affirm\u00e9 M. Surajram. Le t\u00e9moin \u00e9tait franc. Il a dit : [TRADUCTION] Il est difficile de juger sur un seul exemple ses comp\u00e9tences techniques. Cependant, pour la construction du serveur, elle n'avait pas les comp\u00e9tences techniques. Il s'agit d'une demande normale, qui n'est pas difficile. Je lui posait des questions techniques et elle me disait qu'elle me r\u00e9pondrait le lendemain. C'\u00e9tait inhabituel.\n[118] Mme Fahmy nie qu'elle a construit le serveur pour M. Surajram. En contre interrogatoire, M. Surajram a reconnu qu'il n'avait pas de documents prouvant que le serveur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construit. Cependant, il a ajout\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] le serveur existe. Bien que je trouve \u00e9trange qu'aucun document n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour montrer le travail qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, le t\u00e9moignage de vive voix de M. Surajram et de A.W., ainsi que les documents mentionnant la plainte de M. Surajram, me convainquent que son t\u00e9moignage est fiable. Je conclus que Mme Fahmy n'a pas correctement construit le serveur par deux fois pour M. Surajram et qu'elle a eu besoin de beaucoup plus de temps pour faire le travail que ce qui est habituel.\n(ix) Conclusion au sujet du rendement et du cong\u00e9diement [119] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que le rendement professionnel de Mme Fahmy n'\u00e9tait tout simplement pas constant. Il y avait de nombreux exemples de travaux qui n'avaient pas la qualit\u00e9 requise, de l\u00e0 l'expression [TRADUCTION] comp\u00e9tences techniques faibles utilis\u00e9e ci dessus. Selon S.M., le transfert d\u00e9fectueux que Mme Fahmy a effectu\u00e9 sur l'ordinateur portatif de SM est un exemple de ses [TRADUCTION] comp\u00e9tences techniques faibles. Un autre exemple portait sur le fait qu'elle n'\u00e9teignait pas correctement le syst\u00e8me. S.M. a fait remarquer [TRADUCTION] Si [V.J.] l'a fait, peut \u00eatre une fois. Pour Mme Fahmy, de sept \u00e0 neuf fois, le serveur s'est simplement remis en marche seul. J'ai v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le registre. Deux fois, je sais que c'est arriv\u00e9 alors qu'elle sortait de la salle d'ordinateur et, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, nous n'avions pas de contr\u00f4le \u00e0 distance. Ce n'est plus arriv\u00e9 depuis qu'elle a quitt\u00e9 la GTAA. Elle nie ces all\u00e9gations. Le rendement de Mme Fahmy \u00e9tait loin du niveau de perfection qu'elle accordait \u00e0 son travail. Dans une lettre \u00e0 la Commission qui ne portait pas de date, mais qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue le 11 d\u00e9cembre 2003, elle a \u00e9crit [TRADUCTION] une enqu\u00eate est la seule fa\u00e7on que j'aie de prouver ce que j'ai \u00e9crit dans ma plainte et que j'effectuais mon travail de fa\u00e7on parfaite. Il y a aussi sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la Commission dat\u00e9e du 6 janvier 2004, \u00e0 la page 20 : [TRADUCTION] Mon rendement \u00e9tait constamment parfait [...] Il n'y avait rien \u00e0 redire quant \u00e0 mon rendement. Je ne soutiens pas qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable d'effectuer du travail parfait ni qu'elle n'a jamais fait de bon travail. Elle en a \u00e9videmment fait, et la GTAA le reconna\u00eet. L'expression rendement professionnel englobe ses interactions parfois inappropri\u00e9es avec son gestionnaire, S.M., et sa mauvaise attitude. J'estime que le commentaire [TRADUCTION] vous avez montr\u00e9 [...] peu, ou pas, de compr\u00e9hension de votre r\u00f4le et de vos responsabilit\u00e9s, qui se trouve dans la lettre de cong\u00e9diement du 1er mai, r\u00e9sume tout.\nN. All\u00e9gation no 11 : Le processus et l'\u00e9valuation de rendement \u00e9taient un leurre ou un pr\u00e9texte [120] Mme Fahmy soutient que l'\u00e9valuation de rendement qu'on lui a donn\u00e9e le 8 novembre 2002 ne refl\u00e9tait pas correctement son travail et servait de leurre qui visait \u00e0 justifier le traitement discriminatoire dont elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime et son cong\u00e9diement.\n[121] Mme MacKinnon soutient que Mme Fahmy a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e comme [TRADUCTION] bouc \u00e9missaire, qu'on s'\u00e9tait assur\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9choue et que le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation de rendement servait de moyen pour la cong\u00e9dier. Elle soutient aussi que des preuves montraient que l'environnement de travail \u00e9tait hostile ou empoisonn\u00e9, bien qu'il ne s'ag\u00eet pas d'un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique. Mme Rusak a soulev\u00e9 une objection, invoquant l'absence de pr\u00e9avis et mon ordonnance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente qui emp\u00eachaient la plaignante de poursuivre ce point en posant des questions au sujet du comportement des gestionnaires envers les employ\u00e9es dans les autres d\u00e9partements de la GTAA. Dans la logique des commentaires que j'ai formul\u00e9s plus t\u00f4t dans les motifs au sujet de la question du harc\u00e8lement, je ne tirerai aucune conclusion au sujet du harc\u00e8lement ou d'un environnement de travail empoisonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la GTAA. La question de savoir si Mme Fahmy a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e comme bouc \u00e9missaire sera la seule question que je trancherai.\n[122] J'ai examin\u00e9 attentivement la preuve documentaire et le t\u00e9moignage de vive voix quant aux \u00e9valuations de rendement (du 8 novembre et du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2002) et aux nombreuses r\u00e9unions au sujet du rendement de travail de Mme Fahmy. Je note aussi le t\u00e9moignage de S.M., que j'accepte, selon lequel bien qu'il n'ait pas eu beaucoup de r\u00e9unions avec Mme Fahmy depuis mars 2003, alors qu'il travaillait principalement sur le site de construction du Terminal 1, les r\u00e9unions qu'il a eues avec elle \u00e9taient [TRADUCTION] importantes. En vertu de la convention collective, la GTAA n'est tenue d'effectuer qu'une seule \u00e9valuation de rendement pour les employ\u00e9s en probation, \u00e0 mi chemin pendant leur p\u00e9riode de probation. La GTAA l'a fait : l'\u00e9valuation du 8 novembre 2002 et la r\u00e9union o\u00f9 cette \u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e. S.M., Mme Maack, le repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat et la conseill\u00e8re en ressources humaines Jennifer Erbiceanu ont rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante le 13 novembre et le 15 novembre 2002 pour discuter de l'\u00e9valuation. Des notes d\u00e9taill\u00e9es prises pendant ces r\u00e9unions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve. Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2002, Mme Fahmy a obtenu une deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9valuation de rendement \u00e9crite, dans laquelle on avait not\u00e9 des am\u00e9liorations dans tous les domaines \u00e0 un niveau satisfaisant, pour une p\u00e9riode d'un peu plus d'un mois depuis la derni\u00e8re \u00e9valuation. Sa p\u00e9riode de probation a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e de six mois. Mme Fahmy soutient qu'elle n'a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9troaction au sujet de son rendement apr\u00e8s le 17 d\u00e9cembre, jusqu'\u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement le 1er mai 2003. Je note que S.M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une autre \u00e9valuation de rendement de Mme Fahmy au cours de la deuxi\u00e8me ou de la troisi\u00e8me semaine d'avril. Mme Fahmy n'a jamais re\u00e7u cette \u00e9valuation parce qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e le 1er mai, et l'\u00e9valuation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve.\n[123] Je conclus que le contenu des \u00e9valuations de rendement que Mme Fahmy a re\u00e7ues et le processus \u00e9taient raisonnables et satisfaisants. L'objet du processus est de donner de la r\u00e9troaction \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 et de lui permettre de s'am\u00e9liorer, ainsi que de permettre \u00e0 l'employeur d'\u00e9valuer l'employ\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode de probation. Je suis convaincu que l'\u00e9valuation du 8 novembre, les r\u00e9unions du 13, 15, 22 et 29 novembre, ainsi que l'\u00e9valuation du 17 d\u00e9cembre ont donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy une appr\u00e9ciation raisonnable de son travail du point de vue de la GTAA. Dans le processus d'\u00e9valuation, l'employeur a fourni \u00e0 Mme Fahmy une liste des \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers qu'elle n'avait pas respect\u00e9s. J'accepte aussi les t\u00e9moignages de S.M. et de A.W. selon lesquels on avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fahmy un avis des doutes au sujet de son rendement, dans des situations moins officielles que l'\u00e9valuation de rendement \u00e9crite, y compris en 2003.\n[124] Le processus n'\u00e9tait pas un pr\u00e9texte ni un leurre. Le processus d'\u00e9valuation de rendement n'\u00e9tait pas un v\u00e9hicule qui a facilit\u00e9 un cong\u00e9diement discriminatoire. Je conclus aussi qu'une partie du probl\u00e8me venait tout simplement du refus de Mme Fahmy de souscrire \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de son travail faite par S.M. Les notes de la r\u00e9union du 13 novembre 2002 entre S.M., le repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat Mark Daniels, Maria Maack, Jennifer Erbiceanu et Mme Fahmyle soulignent. Cette r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue par suite de l'incident d'ouverture et de fermeture de porte qui avait eu lieu dans le bureau ce jour l\u00e0, o\u00f9 S.M. avait \u00e9t\u00e9 si inquiet qu'il avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse. La GTAA, pendant cette r\u00e9union, a exprim\u00e9 clairement \u00e0 Mme Fahmy que si son travail ne s'am\u00e9liorait pas avant la fin de sa p\u00e9riode de probation, en d\u00e9cembre, elle serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Selon les notes prises, Mme Fahmy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les probl\u00e8mes avec S.M. [TRADUCTION] ont commenc\u00e9 parce qu'elle ne voulait pas s'occuper d'un seul projet - [elle] en voulait plus. Mme Fahmy reconna\u00eet cette d\u00e9claration dans son t\u00e9moignage. Or, le projet en question sur lequel elle ne voulait pas travailler exclusivement se trouvait \u00e0 \u00eatre le projet le plus dispendieux et le plus important sur lequel le d\u00e9partement de la TI travaillait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque.\n[125] Elle a \u00e9crit et a dit \u00e0 S.M. qu'elle acceptait ses critiques, mais elle n'\u00e9tait pas honn\u00eate. Son t\u00e9moignage et les documents qu'elle a donn\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission montrent clairement qu'elle ne le pensait pas lorsqu'elle a \u00e9crit et a dit qu'elle acceptait les critiques. Elle tentait [TRADUCTION] de le mettre de son bord. On peut comprendre en partie qu'elle \u00e9tait terrifi\u00e9e de perdre son emploi, mais le caract\u00e8re sournois de son attitude annihile toute sympathie. \u00c0 ce jour, elle n'accepte toujours pas la critique de la GTAA.\n[126] Je note que la GTAA n'a pas avis\u00e9 Mme Fahmy des plaintes de Lynn Child et de Vishwa Surajram \u00e0 son sujet. La GTAA aurait d\u00fb le faire. Cependant, son d\u00e9faut de le faire ne constitue pas une violation au sens de l'article 7 de la LCDP. Il n'existe aucun lien avec un motif de distinction illicite. Cependant, Mme Fahmy avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de suffisamment de probl\u00e8mes par le processus officiel et non officiel qu'elle aurait d\u00fb clairement savoir que son employeur \u00e9tait d'avis que son travail n'\u00e9tait pas satisfaisant.\n[127] Mme Fahmy a aussi soutenu que le prolongement de sa p\u00e9riode probatoire \u00e9tait une ruse ou un pr\u00e9texte pour la cong\u00e9dier. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette affirmation. Si la GTAA avait voulu la cong\u00e9dier, elle l'aurait fait \u00e0 la fin de sa p\u00e9riode de probation en d\u00e9cembre 2002. La GTAA avait suffisamment de preuves. Elle n'avait pas \u00e0 prolonger sa probation de six mois. Mme Fahmy soutient que son ancienne employeure l'a fait parce qu'elle voulait s'assurer qu'elle ne ferait pas l'objet d'une plainte. Si c'\u00e9tait le motif de la GTAA, cela n'a pas vraiment bien fonctionn\u00e9 - cinq ans se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s, et la GTAA a trait\u00e9 avec la Commission, le processus d'arbitrage de grief et l'audience devant le Tribunal. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de S.M. selon lequel il a dit \u00e0 Mme Fahmy de [TRADUCTION] se d\u00e9tendre, d'\u00eatre elle m\u00eame et qu'il avait voulu lui donner plus de temps pour s'am\u00e9liorer. Je conclus que la GTAA a prolong\u00e9 la p\u00e9riode de probation de bonne foi, souhaitant lui donner l'occasion de s'am\u00e9liorer, plut\u00f4t que dans l'optique d'amasser suffisamment de preuves permettant de la cong\u00e9dier.\n[128] Je comprends que Mme Fahmy ne croit pas que la GTAA a pris une d\u00e9cision honn\u00eate lorsqu'elle a prolong\u00e9 sa probation. Elle a affirm\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Vers d\u00e9cembre, je savais qu'il y avait une intrigue. Cependant, compte tenu de la preuve, je ne vois aucune intrigue, aucun leurre et aucun pr\u00e9texte pour son cong\u00e9diement. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, je n'accepte pas le t\u00e9moignage de D.M. selon lequel S.M. lui a demand\u00e9 d'[TRADUCTION] inventer des lacunes dans le travail de Mme Fahmy. D.M. lui m\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne l'avait pas fait. Sa liste d'[TRADUCTION] \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers non respect\u00e9s \u00e9tait exacte et a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e de bonne foi. Je conclus que les courriels de A.W., M.G. et B.M. envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 S.M. le 29 avril et le 1er mai 2003, dans lesquels ils se plaignaient du travail de Mme Fahmy, n'\u00e9taient pas invent\u00e9s ou \u00e9crits de mauvaise foi. Je crois que cet ensemble de courriels a \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] la goutte qui a fait d\u00e9border le vase, qui a pouss\u00e9 S.M. \u00e0 recommander le cong\u00e9diement de Mme Fahmy le 1er mai. Je conclus que S.M. et A.W. avaient correctement avis\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s qui se plaignaient au sujet de Mme Fahmy qu'ils devaient [TRADUCTION] le mettre par \u00e9crit. C'est loin d'\u00eatre une sollicitation ou une invention de fausses critiques au sujet de son rendement.\nVII. CONCLUSION [129] Dans l'une de ses lettres o\u00f9 elle apporte des pr\u00e9cisions sur sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission, produite le 12 mars 2004, Mme Fahmy a \u00e9crit au paragraphe 6 : [TRADUCTION] mon seul p\u00e9ch\u00e9 \u00e9tait que je n'\u00e9tais pas blanche et que je n'\u00e9tais pas un homme. Elle a aussi \u00e9crit \u00e0 la page 14 de sa r\u00e9plique du 6 janvier 2004 : [TRADUCTION] [...] j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e comme une esclave, vu ce qu'il [S.M.] m'a fait. Il est dommage qu'elle se sente de cette fa\u00e7on. Cependant, la preuve la plus convaincante \u00e9tablit le contraire. Toute diff\u00e9rence de traitement qui pourrait \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de pr\u00e9judiciable et son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur des motifs qui n'\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9s \u00e0 la LCDP, comme je l'ai expliqu\u00e9 dans mes motifs. Cela n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec le fait qu'elle \u00e9tait une femme, une personne de couleur ou une personne d'origine \u00e9gyptienne. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par Matthew D. Garfield\nOTTAWA, Ontario Le 7 mai 2008\n1Voir J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman et A.W.

Il a soutenu qu'il lui avait dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 pour prendre le travail quinconque, mais qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 forfait [TRADUCTION] Il y avait beaucoup de travail \u00e0 faire. Il n'y avait pas suffisament d'employ\u00e9s.\n9La GTAA ne peut pas utiliser cette preuve apr\u00e8s cong\u00e9diement pour \u00e9tayer sa d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier Mme Fahmy.\n10Dans la liste [TRADUCTION] d'\u00e9ch\u00e9anciers non respect\u00e9s de S.M. dat\u00e9e du 14 novembre 2002, il y avait douze points particuliers et un point g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ([TRADUCTION] Beaucoup d'autres t\u00e2ches li\u00e9es \u00e0 son r\u00f4le dans l'\u00e9quipe de projet Windows 2000) \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s sous le titre [TRADUCTION] \u00c9l\u00e9ments livrables du projet W2K.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le 20 juin 2005, Jamel Ben Salem (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en conformit\u00e9 avec la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R. (1985), ch. H-6 (la Loi) contre la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (le CN). Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que le CN a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l'origine nationale ou ethnique en mati\u00e8re d'emploi en refusant de l'embaucher contrairement \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience.\n[3] D'entr\u00e9e de jeu, je tiens \u00e0 rappeler que l'objet de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision n'est pas de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant aurait fait un bon chef de train, ni de reprendre le processus de s\u00e9lection du CN. Mon r\u00f4le est plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9cider, en m'appuyant sur la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, si le CN a fait preuve de discrimination envers le plaignant lors du processus d'embauche.\n[4] Ce n'est pas mon r\u00f4le, non plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ce programme n'est pas de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, de d\u00e9terminer si les responsables de la formation offerte au C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin ont induit le plaignant en erreur en cr\u00e9ant chez lui une attente raisonnable qu'apr\u00e8s sa formation il serait automatiquement embauch\u00e9 comme chef de train. Je me permettrai toutefois d'\u00e9mettre certains commentaires concernant ce programme et notamment son processus de s\u00e9lection, ainsi que sur le r\u00f4le qu'ont jou\u00e9 certains responsables dans les d\u00e9boires du plaignant.\nA. LES FAITS (i) Le plaignant [5] Le plaignant, d'origine tunisienne, est arriv\u00e9 au Canada avec sa famille \u00e0 la fin octobre 2002. Le 27 novembre 2006, il obtenait sa citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne. D\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e au Canada et jusqu'au 8 mars 2005, il dit n'avoir pu se trouver un emploi autre que des emplois \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[6] Dans l'attente de se trouver un emploi permanent, il a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'entreprendre une ma\u00eetrise en g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure de Montr\u00e9al. Toutefois, ses obligations familiales l'ont emp\u00each\u00e9 de mener \u00e0 terme ce projet. Il s'est alors inscrit \u00e0 un programme de formation pour obtenir un permis d'enseignement en formation professionnelle. En juillet 2003, le minist\u00e8re de l'\u00c9ducation de la province de Qu\u00e9bec lui octroyait son permis.\n[7] Selon son curriculum vitae, le plaignant poss\u00e8de seize (16) ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience en entretien ferroviaire, en fabrication m\u00e9canique, en syst\u00e8me de qualit\u00e9 et en formation professionnelle. Il d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at en g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique obtenu en Tunisie et une attestation d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales - \u00e9quipe de train du C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin, obtenu en 2004. Nous reviendrons sur le programme de formation offert par le C\u00e9gep plus longuement plus loin.\n[8] De 1986 \u00e0 1988, il a travaill\u00e9 pour le minist\u00e8re de l'\u00c9ducation nationale de Tunisie \u00e0 titre de formateur professionnel en g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique. De 1988 \u00e0 1989, il \u00e9tait chef de bureau pour une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Tunis. Le 1er juin 1989, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger de Tunis en qualit\u00e9 d'ing\u00e9nieur stagiaire. En juin 1990, il \u00e9tait titularis\u00e9 dans ce poste. Au sein de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9, son curriculum vitae indique qu'il a \u00e9galement occup\u00e9 les postes de chef de bureau de planification et de contrema\u00eetre d'entretien \u00e9lectrom\u00e9canique. Il a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve un certificat de l'Institut de formation international aux transports de la Belgique attestant qu'il a suivi en 1995, le cycle international de formation en voie ferr\u00e9e et transport ferroviaire. Aucune description de ce que comprenait cette formation n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte \u00e0 l'audience.\n[9] Pour d\u00e9montrer ses connaissances de la langue anglaise, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve un dipl\u00f4me du British Council de Tunis, lequel indique qu'il a acquis le niveau de comp\u00e9tence intermediate en anglais. Selon ce document, pour atteindre ce niveau le candidat doit suivre 440 heures de cours. La comp\u00e9tence intermediate signifie, selon le document, que l'\u00e9tudiant peut initiate and conduct conversation on a wide range of personal and factual subjects; understand the main points of authentic texts on factual topics; follow the gist of lectures and extensive rapid speech; write accurate summaries of discussions or texts and simple discursive compositions on abstract topics. They have an active vocabulary of about 3000 words.\n(ii) Le besoin en main-d'uvre de l'industrie ferroviaire du Qu\u00e9bec et le programme de formation offert par le C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald -Godin [10] Pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la rel\u00e8ve de la main-d'uvre dans l'industrie ferroviaire au Qu\u00e9bec, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de promotion de l'industrie ferroviaire, dont Pierre Fallu, un des t\u00e9moins du CN, est le pr\u00e9sident-directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, a cr\u00e9\u00e9, en collaboration avec Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec, une Table sectorielle de l'industrie ferroviaire. L'un des mandats de cette Table sectorielle consistait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un partenariat entre les repr\u00e9sentants des diff\u00e9rentes compagnies de chemins de fers de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et des \u00e9tablissements d'enseignement afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de l'industrie ferroviaire en mati\u00e8re de formation de la main-d'uvre.\n[11] En mars 2003, cette Table sectorielle d\u00e9posait un rapport intitul\u00e9 L'industrie ferroviaire au Qu\u00e9bec, main-d'uvre et formation professionnelle. Ce rapport analysait le probl\u00e8me du vieillissement de la population active dans l'industrie ferroviaire, \u00e9valuait les besoins de recrutement en ciblant les fonctions critiques et proposait une nouvelle approche en mati\u00e8re de formation. Les analyses effectu\u00e9es par les auteurs du rapport permirent de d\u00e9terminer que le volume annuel de recrutement des \u00e9quipes de train, pour les cinq ann\u00e9es qui suivraient sa publication, serait assez important pour justifier le d\u00e9veloppement d'un programme de formation en pr\u00e9-emploi pour les fonctions de chef de train et de m\u00e9canicien de locomotive.\n[12] G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, l'\u00e9quipe d'un train est constitu\u00e9e d'un chef de train et d'un m\u00e9canicien de locomotive. Les t\u00e2ches du chef de train et du m\u00e9canicien de locomotive sont plus ou moins vari\u00e9es selon le type d'entreprise ferroviaire et selon l'envergure de celle-ci. Le chef de train travaille comme membre d'une \u00e9quipe de train en service de ligne (trains de marchandises ou trains voyageurs) ou de triage. Il veille \u00e0 ce que les trains soient bien form\u00e9s et arrivent \u00e0 destination en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il est \u00e9galement responsable de la tenue des enregistrements. Le r\u00f4le principal du m\u00e9canicien de locomotive consiste \u00e0 conduire des locomotives afin d'assurer la cueillette et la livraison du mat\u00e9riel roulant ainsi que le transport de marchandises ou de passagers. Pour devenir un m\u00e9canicien de locomotive, un individu doit tout d'abord \u00eatre un chef de train.\n[13] Selon la Table sectorielle, l'industrie ferroviaire au Qu\u00e9bec pr\u00e9voyait embaucher, dans les cinq ann\u00e9es suivant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du rapport, entre 20 et 25 nouveaux m\u00e9caniciens de locomotive et entre 30 et 35 nouveaux chefs de train, par ann\u00e9e. Afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de formation de la main-d'uvre de l'industrie, la Table sectorielle, en collaboration avec le C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin, d\u00e9veloppa et implanta, pour les ann\u00e9es 2003 et 2004, un programme de formation pour les \u00e9quipes de train.\n[14] \u00c0 partir d'une analyse r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par l'Association des chemins de fer du Canada, les responsables du nouveau programme de formation intitul\u00e9 Transport ferroviaire : \u00e9quipes de train ont pu dresser un profil des comp\u00e9tences pour les professions de chef de train et de m\u00e9canicien de locomotive. Le d\u00e9veloppement du programme de formation s'est fait en collaboration avec des repr\u00e9sentants de l'industrie ferroviaire et d'experts en formation.\n[15] Le programme offert par le C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin menait \u00e0 une attestation d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales. Il avait pour objectif principal de pr\u00e9parer une main-d'uvre sp\u00e9cifiquement form\u00e9e pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de l'industrie ferroviaire. Il visait, selon ses responsables, \u00e0 former des futurs employ\u00e9(e)s qui travailleront comme membres d'une \u00e9quipe de train en service de ligne ou de triage. On ajoutait qu'au terme de leur formation, les candidat(e)s pourront \u00eatre embauch\u00e9s par les compagnies de chemin de fer au Qu\u00e9bec et au Canada et \u00eatre certifi\u00e9s comme chef de train ou m\u00e9canicien de locomotive.\n(iii) Le plaignant s'inscrit au programme de formation [16] Le 31 mars 2004, le plaignant a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance d'information qui s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e dans un h\u00f4tel de Montr\u00e9al. Lors de cette s\u00e9ance, le C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin, en collaboration avec Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec et la Table sectorielle, annon\u00e7a l'\u00e9tablissement d'un nouveau programme de formation. Ce programme \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 une client\u00e8le adulte \u00e0 la recherche d'une carri\u00e8re qui, selon le document remis aux participants, offre une bonne perspective d'emploi, tout en proposant un taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et des avantages sociaux attrayants ainsi que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi. On indiquait \u00e9galement qu'un stage d'int\u00e9gration en milieu de travail figurait dans la liste des cours offerts par le programme.\n[17] Lors de cette s\u00e9ance, les responsables expliqu\u00e8rent la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour \u00eatre admis au programme. Le candidat devait dans un premier temps remplir les formulaires requis par Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec. Selon Pierre Fallu une trentaine de personnes ont rempli les formulaires d'inscription et environ vingt-cinq (25) candidat(e)s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9s \u00e0 des entrevues d'admission.\n[18] Suite \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9sentation, le plaignant s'est rendu \u00e0 Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec afin de remplir le formulaire requis. Par la suite, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue par le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection du C\u00e9gep, lequel comit\u00e9 \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 par Pierre Fallu qui \u00e9tait \u00e9galement le coordonnateur de la Table sectorielle et, comme nous l'avons indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, le pr\u00e9sident directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de promotion de l'industrie ferroviaire. Le comit\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e9galement compos\u00e9 de Jacques Lacoste, \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant du C\u00e9gep, et de Yannick Brunet, un repr\u00e9sentant de l'industrie ferroviaire. Ni M. Lacoste, ni M. Brunet ne furent appel\u00e9s comme t\u00e9moin.\n[19] Selon le rapport de synth\u00e8se des entrevues produit en preuve, Jacques Lacoste a attribu\u00e9 au plaignant la note de 7\/10 pour son entrevue. Les deux autres \u00e9valuateurs, M. Fallu et M. Brunet ont not\u00e9 pour leur part le commentaire over sur leurs feuilles d'\u00e9valuation. Selon Pierre Fallu, M. Brunet et lui \u00e9taient d'avis que le plaignant \u00e9tait trop qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste de chef de train et ils craignaient que s'il obtenait un tel poste, il n'h\u00e9siterait pas, d\u00e8s qu'une meilleure opportunit\u00e9 d'emploi se pr\u00e9senterait, \u00e0 quitter ses fonctions de chef de train. Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter qu'aucun des \u00e9valuateurs ne fait mention de probl\u00e8mes de communication pour refuser le plaignant dans le programme et personne n'exprime de v\u00e9ritable doute quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d'exercer la profession de chef de train, autre qu'il \u00e9tait surqualifi\u00e9. C'est d'ailleurs en raison de cette surqualification, que la recommandation du comit\u00e9 fut, initialement, de ne pas recommander l'acceptation du plaignant au programme.\n[20] Puisque Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec exigeait une cohorte de 15 \u00e0 20 \u00e9tudiant(e)s et que les r\u00e9sultats des entrevues n'avaient pas permis d'atteindre ce nombre, le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de revoir ses recommandations pour certains candidat(e)s. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Fallu, bien que le plaignant ne d\u00e9montrait pas les qualit\u00e9s pour occuper les fonctions de chef de train, le comit\u00e9, afin d'atteindre les objectifs exig\u00e9s par Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 tout de l'accepter dans le programme. Selon M. Fallu, le plaignant \u00e9tait uniquement admis au programme parce qu'on voulait atteindre le nombre d'inscriptions exig\u00e9 par Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec.\n[21] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Fallu ajoutera Je peux vous dire M. Ben Salem que mon premier r\u00e9flexe en vous voyant lors de l'entrevue \u00e9tait que vous \u00e9tiez une personne \u00e0 accident. Vous n'aviez pas les aptitudes \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des situations d'urgence. Ce commentaire est \u00e9tonnant puisqu'il n'en est pas fait mention dans le rapport d'entrevue. De plus, s'il est vrai que M. Fallu avait cette opinion du plaignant, il est ahurissant qu'il ait consenti \u00e0 l'admettre au programme.\n[22] Finalement, dix-neuf (19) candidat(e)s, dont le plaignant, sont retenus pour le programme. La formation d\u00e9bute le 17 mai 2004. Bien que le programme rel\u00e8ve du C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin, les cours se donnent dans des locaux appartenant au CN \u00e0 la Gare Centrale, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. D'ailleurs, certains des formateurs sont des employ\u00e9(e)s du CN.\n[23] Le programme de formation est compos\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rents modules. Lors de la premi\u00e8re session, l'\u00e9tudiant doit suivre des modules en infrastructure ferroviaire, profession chef de train et m\u00e9canicien de locomotive, s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire, le chemin de fer en tant qu'entreprise, les communications appliqu\u00e9es au ferroviaire et un stage d'observation et de pratique. Lors de la deuxi\u00e8me session, les modules incluent initiation \u00e0 l'informatique, service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le et relation d'affaires, r\u00e8glement d'exploitation ferroviaire, autorisation et tenue d'enregistrement, inspections et essais de manuvres et classement de wagons, fonctionnement de la locomotive, conduite de la locomotive et du train et, finalement, un stage d'int\u00e9gration en milieu de travail. Selon la description du programme, le stage d'int\u00e9gration devait \u00eatre d'une dur\u00e9e de 255 heures, sur une p\u00e9riode de huit semaines.\n[24] Le 17 mai 2005, le plaignant obtient son Attestation d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales. Son Bulletin d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales, montre qu'il a obtenu des notes sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la moyenne dans pratiquement tous les cours. Par exemple, dans le module S\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire, il obtient une note de 96, alors que la moyenne du groupe est de 91; dans professions chef de train et m\u00e9canicien de locomotive, il obtient la note de 94, la moyenne du groupe \u00e9tant de 82; dans communications appliqu\u00e9es au ferroviaire, sa note est de 93 et la moyenne 90; et, finalement, dans le Stage d'int\u00e9gration en milieu de travail, on lui attribue une note de 91, alors que la moyenne du groupe est de 89.\n[25] La note attribu\u00e9e pour le Stage d'int\u00e9gration en milieu de travail est pour le moins int\u00e9ressante. Selon M. Fallu, l'industrie ferroviaire avait indiqu\u00e9 aux responsables du programme que, sauf quelques exceptions, elle ne prenait pas de stagiaire. Il ajoute que l'exigence d'un Stage d'int\u00e9gration en milieu de travail d\u00e9coulait des conditions de financement \u00e9mises par Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec. \u00c0 ma surprise, M. Fallu t\u00e9moigna que le plaignant n'avait jamais suivi de stage d'int\u00e9gration en milieu de travail. Lorsque je lui ai demand\u00e9 pourquoi, le plaignant avait re\u00e7u une note de 91 pour un stage, il a r\u00e9pondu que tous les \u00e9tudiant(e)s ont re\u00e7u la m\u00eame note pour ce cours. Lorsque je lui ai fait remarquer que la moyenne du groupe sur le relev\u00e9 de note du plaignant \u00e9tait 89 et que tous les \u00e9tudiant(e)s ne pouvaient donc avoir re\u00e7u la m\u00eame note, il donna l'explication suivante : le coll\u00e8ge avait un probl\u00e8me sur les bras. Il recevait de l'argent du gouvernement pour un stage, mais ce stage n'avait pas lieu. Pour donner une note, on suivait le cheminement de l'\u00e9tudiant pour obtenir un emploi. Mais, il n'y a pas eu de stage en milieu de travail. Lorsque je lui ai demand\u00e9 comment on pouvait donner une note pour un stage qui n'avait pas eu lieu, il ajouta : Moi aussi j'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre, c'\u00e9tait une situation d\u00e9licate pour le coll\u00e8ge. Le coll\u00e8ge n'avait pas le choix de donner une note pour ce module et on donnait une note pour les d\u00e9marches que les \u00e9tudiant(e)s faisaient pour se trouver un travail. Il faudrait demande au coll\u00e8ge moi je ne suis pas impliqu\u00e9 dans cela.\n[26] En contre-interrogatoire il ajoute : Certaines compagnies ont accept\u00e9 de faire des stages. Le coll\u00e8ge s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 des stages. Suite \u00e0 l'information que j'ai fournie au coll\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'effet que les compagnies n'offraient pas de stages \u00e0 proprement dit, mais une formation compl\u00e9mentaire, le coll\u00e8ge [...] a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'\u00eatre en contact avec les industries qui offraient cette formation suppl\u00e9mentaire et voir comment s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e l'int\u00e9gration au travail. Je ne sais pas comment ils ont r\u00e9gl\u00e9 cela avec Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec car c'est un nombre important d'heures dans le programme. Un peu plus loin : On est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre des notes pour le stage, mais dans 95 % des cas, il n'y a pas eu de stage. Les explications du t\u00e9moin sur ce point \u00e9taient loin d'\u00eatre satisfaisantes.\n[27] Jacques Lacoste, le conseiller p\u00e9dagogique du C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin a \u00e9crit pour le plaignant une lettre de recommandation assez \u00e9logieuse. Malheureusement, M. Lacoste n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin \u00e0 l'audience. Concernant cette lettre, M. Fallu a fait un autre commentaire remarquable. Selon lui, les responsables du programme avaient pris la d\u00e9cision d'uniformiser les lettres de recommandations des \u00e9tudiant(e)s, \u00e0 un point tel que les lettres \u00e9taient, selon M. Fallu, des lettres copi\u00e9es\/coll\u00e9es. Une telle proc\u00e9dure, si c'est bien ce qui s'est produit, ne fait pas tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux et d\u00e9montre \u00e0 la fois un manque de respect et de professionnalisme tant \u00e0 l'endroit des employeurs potentiels que des \u00e9tudiant(e)s inscrits au programme.\n[28] M. Fallu ne m'est pas apparu comme un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible et, sauf pour une tendance \u00e0 l'autojustification et \u00e0 vouloir jeter sur d'autres la responsabilit\u00e9 pour les probl\u00e8mes encourus, son t\u00e9moignage n'a apport\u00e9 aucun \u00e9claircissement sur la question que j'ai \u00e0 trancher. Je dois admettre cependant, qu'ayant \u00e9cout\u00e9 ce t\u00e9moignage, je suis en mesure de mieux comprendre la frustration du plaignant \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Fallu et envers le programme de formation.\n(iv) L'annonce de poste du CN et le processus de s\u00e9lection des candidat(e)s [29] Mme Christine O'Neill, directrice des ressources humaines pour la r\u00e9gion de l'est du Canada au CN, a longuement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur le processus d'embauche de l'intim\u00e9e. Je l'ai trouv\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible et digne de foi. Ses r\u00e9ponses aux questions \u00e9taient r\u00e9fl\u00e9chies et pos\u00e9es.\n[30] Elle explique qu'en mars 2005, le CN \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche d'employ\u00e9(e)s pour occuper les fonctions de chef de train. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce moment au courant du programme de formation offert au C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin car une certaine Mme S. Seebeck, la directrice de la formation au CN qui travaillait en \u00e9troite collaboration avec la Table sectorielle, l'en avait inform\u00e9e. Toutefois, elle ajoute que le CN ne jouait aucun r\u00f4le dans le recrutement ou l'admission des \u00e9tudiant(e)s \u00e0 ce programme et qu'il n'avait pris aucun engagement envers les \u00e9tudiant(e)s qui y \u00e9taient inscrits. Cependant, Mme O'Neill ajoute qu'elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 recevoir ces \u00e9tudiant(e)s en entrevue, car elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche de candidat de mani\u00e8re urgente pour les postes de chefs de train et elle savait que ceux-ci, bien qu'ils n'aient aucune exp\u00e9rience pratique, poss\u00e9daient les connaissances techniques n\u00e9cessaires pour exercer ce travail. Mme Seebeck l'a donc mise en contact avec M. Lacoste et elle lui a \u00e9galement fait parvenir les curriculums vitae des \u00e9tudiant(e)s qu'elle avait re\u00e7us du coll\u00e8ge.\n[31] En 2005, le CN annonce donc sur son site internet qu'il est dans le processus de b\u00e2tir un r\u00e9servoir de candidat(e)s int\u00e9ress\u00e9s par une carri\u00e8re de chef de train. L'annonce d\u00e9crit comme suit les exigences du poste :\nBonnes aptitudes au travail d'\u00e9quipe;\nUn certain entregent;\nAptitude physique pour le travail;\nConnaissance des signaux ou du registre des signaux en vue d'obtenir la bonne information\nBonne capacit\u00e9 de lecture;\nComp\u00e9tences en technologie de l'information et en informatique utiles pour le travail.\nCapacit\u00e9 de bien analyser une situation et de r\u00e9agir ad\u00e9quatement;\nQuarts de travail, loin du domicile durant des p\u00e9riodes pouvant aller jusqu'\u00e0 six jours;\n\u00catre sur appel, pr\u00eat et capable de travailler sur les affectations.\n[32] Mme O'Neill ajoutera \u00e0 cette liste de comp\u00e9tence la connaissance de l'anglais, jug\u00e9e essentielle pour occuper un poste de chef de train au CN. Bien que cela ne f\u00fbt pas mentionn\u00e9 dans l'annonce, lorsque le candidat remplissait son formulaire de candidature une question lui \u00e9tait pos\u00e9e quant \u00e0 sa connaissance de l'anglais et du fran\u00e7ais.\n[33] Les candidat(e)s souhaitant postuler \u00e0 un des postes de chef de train devaient postuler par l'interm\u00e9diaire du site web du CN et remplir un formulaire intitul\u00e9 Candidate Response Report qui est, en quelque sorte, une auto-\u00e9valuation faite par le postulant. Selon Mme O'Neill, soixante et onze personnes pos\u00e8rent leurs candidatures. De ce nombre, onze provenaient du C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin. Elle ajoute, sans expliquer d'o\u00f9 elle tire cette information, que les huit autres \u00e9tudiant(e)s du C\u00e9gep ne pos\u00e8rent pas leur candidature soit parce qu'ils s'\u00e9taient trouv\u00e9s un emploi ailleurs ou parce que leur connaissance de l'anglais \u00e9tait insuffisante.\n[34] Le 25 janvier 2005, le plaignant pose sa candidature par l'interm\u00e9diaire du site web. \u00c0 la question : Some of our positions require bilingualism. Can you read and speak fluently in both English or French?, le plaignant r\u00e9pond oui. Selon Mme O'Neill certaines r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es sur le Candidate Response Report peuvent disqualifier imm\u00e9diatement un candidat. Elle donne pour exemple la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question sur les capacit\u00e9s de bilinguisme du candidat. Si le candidat r\u00e9pond non \u00e0 cette question, il est, \u00e0 moins de preuve du contraire, automatiquement exclu de la liste. Le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 disqualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape.\n[35] La premi\u00e8re phase du processus d'embauche du CN consiste \u00e0 un test de mouvements de train. Ce test est d\u00e9crit comme un test de logique o\u00f9 on demande aux candidat(e)s de d\u00e9placer des wagons sur papier comme ils auraient \u00e0 le faire pour vrai s'ils \u00e9taient retenus pour le poste. Les candidat(e)s ont 25 minutes pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ce test. C'est Mme O'Neill qui corrige le test.\n[36] Le plaignant, ayant r\u00e9ussi le test de mouvement de train, est invit\u00e9, le 8 mars 2005, \u00e0 une entrevue avec Mme Christine O'Neill. Pour certains candidat(e)s, Mme O'Neill pr\u00e9cisera que l'entrevue se d\u00e9roule devant deux intervieweurs, l'autre intervieweur \u00e9tant pr\u00e9sent pour \u00e9valuer les connaissances techniques du candidat. Dans le cas des \u00e9tudiant(e)s du C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin, seule Mme O'Neill \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'entrevue, car elle pr\u00e9sumait qu'ils poss\u00e9daient d\u00e9j\u00e0 le bagage technique n\u00e9cessaire et qu'elle n'avait pas besoin d'un autre intervieweur pour l'assister sur ces questions.\n[37] Les entrevues des candidat(e)s d\u00e9but\u00e8rent le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2005 et se poursuivirent jusqu'au 13 mars 2005. Selon Mme O'Neill, elle commence toujours les entrevues en posant des questions d'ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, cherchant ainsi \u00e0 mettre le candidat \u00e0 l'aise. Elle ajoute que r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elle prend beaucoup de notes lors d'un entrevue, tout en pr\u00e9cisant que si quelqu'un parle vite, j'ai moins de notes, mais, s'il parle moins vite, je peux prendre des notes plus compl\u00e8tes. Dans le cas du plaignant, puisqu'il parlait lentement, elle a eu le temps de prendre plus de notes.\n[38] Pour les entrevues, Mme O'Neill suit un document intitul\u00e9 Interview Guide for Entry-Level Transportation. Selon ce guide, le premier domaine abord\u00e9 est l'exp\u00e9rience de travail (work background) du candidat. Selon les notes de Mme O'Neill - prise en anglais m\u00eame si l'entrevue s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e en fran\u00e7ais - le plaignant lui aurait expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment qu'il poss\u00e9dait un dipl\u00f4me en g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique et plus de treize (13) ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine des chemins de fers. Il lui a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 du programme de formation qu'il avait suivi au coll\u00e8ge G\u00e9rald-Godin. \u00c0 la question \u00e0 savoir pourquoi il voulait travailler pour l'intim\u00e9e, le plaignant aurait r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait toujours voulu travailler pour un chemin de fer de classe 1.\n[39] Le t\u00e9moin pr\u00e9cisera qu'elle assumait que le plaignant avait une bonne connaissance technique du travail d'un chef de train en raison des cours qu'il avait suivi au C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin et de son exp\u00e9rience ant\u00e9rieure. Il n'\u00e9tait donc pas n\u00e9cessaire de v\u00e9rifier cet aspect plus \u00e0 fond. De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elle pr\u00e9cise que lors de l'entrevue le plaignant \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 et g\u00ean\u00e9 et qu'il \u00e9tait parfois difficile de lui arracher des r\u00e9ponses.\n[40] Mme O'Neill explique avoir par la suite proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de questions afin de mesurer la r\u00e9action du plaignant dans des situations particuli\u00e8res de travail.\n[41] \u00c0 une s\u00e9rie de questions visant \u00e0 mesurer ce qu'elle a d\u00e9crit comme la dimension orientation, elle a attribu\u00e9 au plaignant une note de 3 sur 5 en ce qui concerne ses r\u00e9ponses sur le fond et de 2 sur 5, pour ce qui est de ses qualit\u00e9s de communication. Selon son bar\u00e8me, trois sur cinq \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 bien, alors qu'avec une note de deux il ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences. Mme O'Neill a reconnu qu'il semble que la copie du guide d'entrevue du plaignant soit la seule copie sur laquelle elle a marqu\u00e9 des notes num\u00e9riques. Elle pr\u00e9cisera : Je ne sais pas pourquoi. Je ne sais pas si c'est parce que j'avais le temps de le faire, mais c'est le seul \u00e0 qui j'ai mis des notes. Souvent je mets des moins ou des plus, mais je ne sais pas pourquoi je ne l'ai pas fait ici..\n[42] Suivaient ensuite des questions visant \u00e0 mesurer l' autonomie du candidat. Pour cette partie de l'entrevue, le plaignant obtient la note de 2 sur 5, ce qui indique qu'il ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences entendues. Mme O'Neill a expliqu\u00e9 que, selon son appr\u00e9ciation, les r\u00e9ponses du plaignant aux questions qui lui \u00e9taient pos\u00e9es ne lui permettaient pas de conclure qu'il \u00e9tait autonome. Elle pr\u00e9cisera : Il \u00e9tait passif, mais s\u00e9curitaire. Avec son attitude, le CN perd de l'argent..\n[43] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'aspect s\u00e9curit\u00e9, le plaignant satisfaisait les attentes de Mme O'Neill. Elle ajoute m\u00eame que ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 cette partie de l'entrevue \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s bonnes, d'o\u00f9 la note de trois qu'elle lui a attribu\u00e9e tant au niveau de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 que de la communication.\n[44] Dans la partie portant sur apprentissage en pratique, Mme O'Neill expliquera que tous les chefs de trains doivent suivre une formation et son objectif est donc d'\u00e9valuer si le candidat suivra cette formation jusqu'au bout, m\u00eame si celle-ci s'av\u00e8re difficile. Encore une fois dans cette partie de l'entrevue, Mme O'Neill fut satisfaite des r\u00e9ponses du plaignant sur le fond, mais elle fut assez critique en ce qui concerne ses capacit\u00e9s de communicateur. Elle dit : Quand un candidat vient en entrevue, ses capacit\u00e9s c'est beau, mais il faut qu'il soit capable de vendre sa salade. Il [le plaignant] avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer one on one avec moi. Il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s passif lors de l'entrevue. Il fallait que je le pousse pour qu'il r\u00e9ponde aux questions.\n[45] Pour ce qui est de la partie portant sur les habilit\u00e9s de collaboration du plaignant, Mme O'Neill s'est dite insatisfaite des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es. Elle trouvait qu'il n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer de bonnes capacit\u00e9s de collaboration. Elle pr\u00e9cise que sur un train, le chef de train n'a aucun pouvoir de discipline sur ses coll\u00e8gues de travail, il doit plut\u00f4t poss\u00e9der des qualit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociateurs. Il doit \u00eatre en n\u00e9gociation constante afin de faire avancer son train. Elle consid\u00e9rait que les r\u00e9ponses du plaignant ne d\u00e9montraient pas l'esprit de collaboration n\u00e9cessaire.\n[46] Finalement, elle indique qu'elle pose toujours sa derni\u00e8re question dans l'autre langue officielle, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, l'anglais. Tout en reconnaissant que le plaignant avait r\u00e9pondu en anglais, elle ajoute qu'elle n'avait pas bien compris son anglais et que pour elle ses capacit\u00e9s dans cette langue n'\u00e9taient pas suffisantes pour r\u00e9pondre aux exigences du poste.\n[47] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Mme O'Neill expliquera que suite \u00e0 l'entrevue, elle n'avait pas d'inqui\u00e9tudes en ce qui concerne la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant d'apprendre les r\u00e8glements. Ce qui la pr\u00e9occupait toutefois c'\u00e9tait sa capacit\u00e9 d'utiliser son entregent et ses capacit\u00e9s de communication.. Au terme de l'entrevue, selon l'appr\u00e9ciation de Mme O'Neill, le plaignant ne s'est pas qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste de chef de train. Elle pr\u00e9cisera qu'il ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences au niveau des bonnes aptitudes de travail en \u00e9quipe et dans sa capacit\u00e9 de bien analyser une situation et de r\u00e9agir ad\u00e9quatement. Mme O'Neill pr\u00e9cisera en contre-interrogatoire qu'elle n'avait pas embauch\u00e9 de candidat(e)s moins qualifi\u00e9s que le plaignant car elle avait jug\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9.\n[48] Elle ajoutera avoir utilis\u00e9 le m\u00eame guide d'entrevue pour chaque candidat et que celui-ci est \u00e0 son avis le meilleur \u00e0 sa disposition. Elle dit s'\u00eatre bas\u00e9e sur les r\u00e9ponses qu'elle a re\u00e7ues en entrevue pour en arriver \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision et sur aucun autre facteur.\n[49] En contre-interrogatoire, le plaignant questionnera longuement Mme O'Neill sur les r\u00e9ponses que les candidat(e)s retenus ont offertes lors de l'entrevue. Sans reprendre en d\u00e9tail les explications du t\u00e9moin, car mon objectif n'est pas de refaire l'exercice des entrevues, je dois pr\u00e9ciser que ses r\u00e9ponses me paraissent cr\u00e9dibles, raisonnables et aucunement compatibles avec une conclusion que l'intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination envers le plaignant.\n[50] En ce qui concerne les all\u00e9gations qu'elle aurait discrimin\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit du plaignant parce qu'il est arabe, Mme O'Neill tout en reconnaissant qu'elle n'a interview\u00e9 qu'un candidat arabe en 2005, soit le plaignant, ajoutera en avoir test\u00e9 plus d'un. Par exemple, elle expliquera qu'un autre candidat arabe avait \u00e9t\u00e9 test\u00e9, mais qu'il avait retir\u00e9 sa candidature parce qu'il s'\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9 un poste avec une autre compagnie. En 2007, ce candidat \u00e9tant \u00e0 nouveau disponible, et puisqu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9ussi le test \u00e9crit, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 un entrevu et a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9. Aujourd'hui, il occupe un poste de chef de train chez l'intim\u00e9.\n[51] Mme O'Neill a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 d'un autre candidat arabe de la promotion du plaignant, qui en avril 2007, a postul\u00e9 pour un poste d'agent de la voie chez l'intim\u00e9 et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9. Elle ajoute qu'il est aujourd'hui superviseur adjoint de la voie. Elle pr\u00e9cise qu'il n'a pas obtenu de poste comme chef de train car il n'est toujours pas bilingue.\n[52] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue, sans preuve \u00e0 l'appui, que l'intim\u00e9 avait embauch\u00e9 ces personnes en r\u00e9action et afin de contrer sa plainte. Je ne peux accepter ces pr\u00e9tentions qui ne sont que de simples suppositions. Je constate par compte que le plaignant depuis son premier \u00e9chec n'a jamais postul\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau au CN ni pour un poste de chef de train, ni pour tout autre poste, il est donc impossible de savoir si le CN l'aurait embauch\u00e9.\n[53] \u00c0 la suite de son processus d'embauche, l'intim\u00e9 a recrut\u00e9 vingt-cinq nouveaux (25) chefs de train. Sur les onze (11) candidat(e)s du Cegep G\u00e9rald-Godin qui ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature, seulement six (6) se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'entrevue. Les cinq (5) autres auraient retir\u00e9 leur candidature, car ils avaient trouv\u00e9 entre-temps un emploi ailleurs. Sur les six (6) qui ont pass\u00e9 l'entrevue, cinq (5) ont re\u00e7u une offre d'emploi. De ces cinq (5), Mme O'Neill pr\u00e9cisera qu'il y avait un immigrant et une femme.\n[54] Quelques jours apr\u00e8s son entrevue, le plaignant dit avoir contact\u00e9 le C\u00e9gep pour savoir s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu pour un poste de chef de train au CN. Jacques Lacoste l'aurait alors inform\u00e9 que sa candidature avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Le plaignant dit qu'il a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de rejoindre Mme O'Neill pour conna\u00eetre les raisons du rejet de sa candidature, mais sans succ\u00e8s.\n[55] Le 20 juin 2005, le plaignant d\u00e9pose une plainte contre le CN. Selon le plaignant, l'acte de discrimination du CN est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, car la d\u00e9cision de ne pas retenir sa candidature en raison de son origine ethnique avait, selon lui, \u00e9t\u00e9 prise avant qu'il ne soit invit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entrevue.\nB. Le cadre juridique [56] L'article 7 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que de refuser d'employer un individu pour des raisons fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite dont notamment, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, constitue un acte discriminatoire. (Voir \u00e9galement les articles 3 et 15 de la Loi).\n[57] Le fardeau de preuve, dans une affaire comme la pr\u00e9sente, incombe tout d'abord au plaignant qui doit \u00e9tablir un cas prima facie de discrimination. (Voir : Israeli c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Commission de la fonction publique (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, 1618; Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029; Premakumar c. Air Canada, D.T. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04; et, Lincoln c. Bay Ferries, 2004 CAF 204.).\n[58] Un cas prima facie est celui qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui sont faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, sont compl\u00e8tes et suffisantes pour justifier un verdict favorable au plaignant, en l'absence d'une r\u00e9ponse de la part de l'intim\u00e9e. (Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Etobicoke (Borough), [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 208; Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Lt\u00e9e, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au par. 28.).\n[59] Dans le contexte de l'embauche, un cas prima facie est d\u00e9crit comme exigeant une preuve des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui suivent :\nle plaignant avait les qualifications pour l'emploi en cause; le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9; une personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui n'avait pas le trait distinctif \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte a subs\u00e9quemment obtenu le poste.\n(Shakes c. Rex Pak Lt\u00e9e (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, au paragraphe 8918)\n[60] Une fois une preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie, le fardeau se d\u00e9place sur l'intim\u00e9e, qui doit alors fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e. (Voir Lincoln, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 23).\n[61] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet la difficult\u00e9 de prouver les all\u00e9gations de discrimination par moyen d'une preuve directe. Comme mentionn\u00e9e dans Basi, la discrimination se pratique souvent de mani\u00e8re subtile. Rares sont les cas de discrimination pratiqu\u00e9s ouvertement. (Voir Basi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. D\/5038.) Il appartient donc au Tribunal de tenir compte de toutes les circonstances pour \u00e9tablir s'il existe ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme de subtiles odeurs de discrimination. (Premakumar, par. 79.)\n[62] La norme de la preuve dans les causes de discrimination est la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Selon cette norme, l'on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible. (Premakumar, par. 81.) Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, cependant, que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient la seule raison des actes en cause pour qu'une plainte soit accept\u00e9e. Ce sera suffisant si ces consid\u00e9rations sont des facteurs de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher. (Premakumar, par. 82; Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au para. D\/15.) .\n[63] Je tiens \u00e9galement \u00e0 rappeler que ce n'est pas la t\u00e2che du Tribunal de juger de la justesse du bien-fond\u00e9 du choix de candidats de l'intim\u00e9. Dans chaque processus d'embauche, il existe un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de subjectivit\u00e9. Le simple fait que l'intim\u00e9 ait utilis\u00e9 des crit\u00e8res subjectifs pour juger les candidat(e)s et qu'il peut avoir commis une erreur en se faisant, ne rend pas en soi sa d\u00e9cision finale susceptible de contestation au motif qu'elle est discriminatoire, bien que la pr\u00e9sence de crit\u00e8res subjectifs puisse n\u00e9cessiter un examen plus minutieux de la d\u00e9cision d'embauche. (Voir : Folch c. Ligne a\u00e9rienne Canadien International Limit\u00e9e (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/261, D\/303; Morin c. Canada (G.R.C.), 2005 TCDP 41, au para 213..\nC. Application de ces crit\u00e8res au cas en l'esp\u00e8ce [64] Dans l'arr\u00eat Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd , [2004] C.A.F. 204, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cise, au paragraphe 22, que pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question \u00e0 savoir si une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, le Tribunal ne doit pas, \u00e0 ce stade, tenir compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9e. Ainsi pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant avait les comp\u00e9tences pour l'emploi en cause, je m'en remettrai essentiellement \u00e0 la preuve soumise par le plaignant. La preuve d\u00e9montre que le plaignant poss\u00e9dait une attestation d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales du coll\u00e8ge G\u00e9rald-Godin qui confirmait qu'il avait r\u00e9ussi le programme de formation Transport ferroviaire : \u00e9quipes de train. Selon Mme O'Neill, ce programme devait lui fournir les connaissances techniques n\u00e9cessaires pour exercer le m\u00e9tier de chef de train. De plus, il poss\u00e9dait un dipl\u00f4me en g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique et une certaine exp\u00e9rience de travail dans le domaine ferroviaire acquis en Tunisie, bien que je reconnaisse que cette exp\u00e9rience n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 titre de chef de train. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement obtenu une note de passage dans le Test de mouvement de train. Aux fins de l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie, nous pouvons donc conclure que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli qu'il poss\u00e9dait les qualifications techniques n\u00e9cessaires pour l'emploi de chef de train.\n[65] La preuve \u00e9tablit \u00e9galement que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour le poste convoit\u00e9. Ainsi, les deux premiers crit\u00e8res de la d\u00e9cision Shakes qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits. Qu'en est-il toutefois du troisi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re? La preuve ne me permet pas de conclure si l'intim\u00e9 a retenu pour le poste une personne moins qualifi\u00e9e que le plaignant. Cependant je suis pr\u00eat, aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire de conclure qu'une preuve prima facie a n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[66] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je tiens \u00e0 rappeler que dans la d\u00e9cision Premakumar c. Air Canada, D.T. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04, le Tribunal a tenu \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que les crit\u00e8res de l'affaire Shakes, bien qu'ils soient des guides utiles, ne devraient pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re rigide et arbitraire. Il faut plut\u00f4t tenir compte des circonstances de chaque affaire pour \u00e9tablir si, en fin de compte, le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu au crit\u00e8re de l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, c'est-\u00e0-dire, est-ce que la preuve devant le Tribunal, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9e. J'appliquerai donc cette approche flexible au cas en l'esp\u00e8ce et conclurai, aux fins de la premi\u00e8re partie de la d\u00e9cision que, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9e, le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une cause prima facie de discrimination.\n[67] La preuve prima facie ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, le fardeau se d\u00e9place maintenant sur l'intim\u00e9e, qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e.\n[68] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme O'Neill a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on claire ce sur quoi les candidat(e)s aux postes de chef de train \u00e9taient \u00e9valu\u00e9s et les raisons pour lesquelles elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le profil du plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas ad\u00e9quat pour ce poste. Elle a signal\u00e9, entre autres, le fait que, selon elle, le plaignant avait des probl\u00e8mes de communication, qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas satisfaite de sa capacit\u00e9 de pouvoir travailler en \u00e9quipe, qu'elle consid\u00e9rait que ses r\u00e9actions dans certaines situations ne r\u00e9pondaient pas aux attentes de l'intim\u00e9 et que ses capacit\u00e9s en anglais laissaient \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer.\n[69] En ce qui concerne les capacit\u00e9s en langue anglaise des postulants pour un poste de chef de train, bien que cette exigence ne f\u00fbt pas mentionn\u00e9e dans l'annonce du poste, la preuve non contest\u00e9e pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience montre clairement que les candidat(e)s savaient que cela serait une consid\u00e9ration dans la d\u00e9cision de retenir ou non leur candidature. Le Candidate Response Report posait la question suivante : Some of our position require bilingualism. Can you read and speak fluently in both English or French? D'ailleurs et , malgr\u00e9 le fait que je n'accorde autrement pas trop de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la preuve soumise par Pierre Fallu, son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'effet que les \u00e9tudiant(e)s du coll\u00e8ge G\u00e9rald-Godin avaient tous \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s de ne pas postuler \u00e0 un chemin de fer de classe 1 si leur comp\u00e9tence en anglais n'\u00e9tait pas ad\u00e9quate.\n[70] Le plaignant n'a pas contest\u00e9 cette preuve. Il a plut\u00f4t cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'il poss\u00e9dait cette comp\u00e9tence en d\u00e9posant en preuve une attestation du British Council de Tunis, affirmant qu'il poss\u00e9dait certaines comp\u00e9tences en anglais. Mme O'Neill ne semble pas en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincue lors de l'entrevue et a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme insuffisantes les comp\u00e9tences du plaignant en anglais. Aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qui me permet de conclure que Mme O'Neill est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 cette conclusion en raison de l'origine nationale ou ethnique du plaignant.\n[71] Compte tenu de l'ensemble de la preuve, je suis persuad\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 rencontrer son fardeau et qu'il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas retenir le plaignant pour un poste de chef de train n'\u00e9tait aucunement motiv\u00e9e par des raisons discriminatoires. Mme O'Neill a expliqu\u00e9 les raisons qui l'ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas retenir la candidature du plaignant et rien dans ces explications ne laisse croire que la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique du plaignant n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 une consid\u00e9ration. De plus, ses explications sont raisonnables et n'ont pas l'air d'un pr\u00e9texte.\n[72] Bien que j'aie beaucoup de sympathie pour la situation du plaignant et que je puisse comprendre sa frustration et son d\u00e9sillusionnement, notamment en ce qui concerne le programme offert par le C\u00e9gep G\u00e9rald-Godin, je ne peux conclure que sa condition est imputable \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire de la part de l'intim\u00e9. Je rappelle encore que ce n'est pas le mandat du Tribunal de se prononcer sur l'efficacit\u00e9, la justesse ou la pr\u00e9cision du processus de s\u00e9lection de l'intim\u00e9, mais plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer si ce processus est entach\u00e9 de discrimination, ce qui, d'apr\u00e8s mon appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[73] La plainte de M.

Grant Sinclair\nContestation de la constitutionnalit\u00e9\n[1] L'intim\u00e9, Jason Ouwendyk, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de son intention de contester l'applicabilit\u00e9, la validit\u00e9 et l'effet constitutionnel de l'article 13 et des paragraphes 54(1) et 54(1.1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il soutient que ces dispositions portent atteinte aux droits garantis par les alin\u00e9as 2a), 2b) et 2d) et l'article 7 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et que l'atteinte ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e au sens de l'article premier.\n[2] Le Tribunal a invit\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 lui pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard pendant le processus d'audience. Selon M. Ouwendyk, il convient de proc\u00e9der comme dans Warman c. Lemire (dossier no T1073\/5405), affaire portant sur une autre plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 13 o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9 a avanc\u00e9 des arguments quasi identiques \u00e0 l'appui de sa contestation de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des m\u00eames dispositions de la Loi. Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal a entendu en m\u00eame temps la preuve relative \u00e0 la question constitutionnelle et relative au fond de la plainte. Au terme de plus de cinq semaines d'audience, les parties (dont un certain nombre de mis en cause et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada) doivent pr\u00e9senter leurs observations finales en juin 2008.\n[3] Puisqu'il y a contestation de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de ces dispositions dans d'autres causes, outre l'affaire Warman c. Lemire, et que les d\u00e9cisions dans ces affaires pourraient \u00eatre rendues avant le r\u00e8glement de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, la Commission soutient que la question constitutionnelle devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, une fois que le Tribunal aura entendu la preuve relative aux all\u00e9gations du plaignant et rendu une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[4] Une question semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e relativement au contr\u00f4le judiciaire par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans l'affaire Warman c. Kulbashian et al. (dossier du tribunal no T869\/1903 et no de dossier de la Cour T-572-06). Les intim\u00e9s dans cette affaire ont contest\u00e9 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des m\u00eames dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce par M. Ouwendyk, mais ils l'ont fait directement en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L'argument n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 devant le Tribunal. La Commission et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada ont demand\u00e9 la suspension du contr\u00f4le judiciaire jusqu'au prononc\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Lemire. La Cour s'est dite d'accord, d\u00e9clarant qu'il convient de suspendre la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure pour le motif que la seule question soulev\u00e9e dans l'avis de demande modifi\u00e9 des demandeurs est actuellement soumise \u00e0 un tribunal dans l'affaire Lemire (voir 2007 CF 354, paragraphe 42). Au nombre des facteurs sur lesquels la Cour s'est pench\u00e9e figurent le risque de conclusions contradictoires, les co\u00fbts excessifs et la capacit\u00e9 de la Cour d'accorder une r\u00e9paration compl\u00e8te. La Cour a fait remarquer que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l'affaire Lemire, y compris toute demande subs\u00e9quente de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, pourra guider la Cour quand elle conna\u00eetra de l'affaire Kulbashian et al.\n[5] Ces facteurs sont \u00e9galement pertinents en l'esp\u00e8ce. Pour les motifs donn\u00e9s par la Cour, il ne conviendrait pas de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'instruction d'une contestation constitutionnelle quasi identique \u00e0 celle soulev\u00e9e dans l'affaire Lemire.\n[6] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne l'instruction imm\u00e9diate de cette plainte, mais uniquement eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la preuve portant sur les all\u00e9gations qui y sont soulev\u00e9es. La question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es sera examin\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision dans Lemire. S'il juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal ne rendra aucune ordonnance tant qu'il n'aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 en dernier ressort sur la question constitutionnelle.\nRequ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la demande d'assignations\n[7] L'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de d\u00e9livrer des assignations \u00e0 six employ\u00e9s de la Commission et \u00e0 un ancien membre du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. Il compte citer ces t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l'appui de sa contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte.\n[8] La Commission a demand\u00e9 par voie de requ\u00eate le rejet de cette demande. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision de reporter l'instruction de la question constitutionnelle, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de statuer \u00e0 ce moment sur la demande des intim\u00e9s ni sur la requ\u00eate de la Commission.\nSign\u00e9 par J.

La CN a-t-elle pris des mesures d'accommodement pour M. Smith?\nVI. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] James Smith est le plaignant en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il est m\u00e9canicien de locomotive pour la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (CN), mais il n'occupe plus cette fonction depuis 2001.\n[2] M. Smith a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la CN comme serre-freins \u00e0 Edmonton en 1979. En 1981, il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Prince George (Colombie-Britannique) et a travaill\u00e9 comme chef de train et serre-freins. En 1987, il s'est qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste de m\u00e9canicien de locomotive et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler dans ce poste pour la CN.\n[3] En 1989, M. Smith a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Terrace (Colombie-Britannique), o\u00f9 il habite pr\u00e9sentement avec sa femme. Ils aiment beaucoup habiter \u00e0 Terrace. Mme Smith travaille comme assistante de biblioth\u00e8que pour la commission scolaire locale. Elle est dipl\u00f4m\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de pharmacienne. Leurs enfants n'habitent plus \u00e0 la maison.\nA. La blessure au dos de M. Smith [4] Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont finalement pouss\u00e9 M. Smith \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une plainte de discrimination, le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2002, devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 17 novembre 1997. C'est ce jour-l\u00e0 qu'il s'est bless\u00e9 au dos en d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant un d\u00e9railleur (qui p\u00e8se environ 60 livres) pour pouvoir sortir la locomotive d'un atelier de la CN \u00e0 Prince Rupert. Il a d\u00e9crit la situation en disant : [traduction] quelque chose \u00e0 l\u00e2ch\u00e9 dans mon dos.\nB. Le retour de M. Smith au travail apr\u00e8s sa blessure [5] M. Smith a quitt\u00e9 le travail le 17 novembre 1997. Il a vu son m\u00e9decin, le Dr Appleton, qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un rapport de m\u00e9decin traitant \u00e0 la Worker's Compensation Board (WCB) (commission des accidents de travail), le 20 novembre 1997, dans lequel il attestait que M. Smith souffrait de douleurs aigu\u00ebs au bas du dos. Le Dr Appleton a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il pr\u00e9voyait que M. Smith puisse retourner au travail le 27 novembre 1997. M. Smith a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande \u00e0 la WCB le 25 novembre 1997.\n[6] Pendant qu'il \u00e9tait en arr\u00eat de travail, M. Smith a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 la Skeena Work Conditioning Clinic (une clinique de conditionnement au travail). Selon le rapport du 18 f\u00e9vrier 1998 de la clinique, M. Smith \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 ses t\u00e2ches r\u00e9guli\u00e8res sans limite.\n[7] M. Smith est bien retourn\u00e9 au travail le 27 f\u00e9vrier 1998. Apr\u00e8s son retour au travail, il a signal\u00e9 qu'il avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 s'asseoir en raison de douleurs \u00e0 la jambe gauche et dans le bas du dos. Comme m\u00e9canicien de locomotive, il \u00e9tait assis la plupart du temps alors qu'il conduisait la locomotive de Terrace \u00e0 d'autres endroits sur la ligne du Nord de la CN, tels que Prince George, Prince Rupert, Smithers et Kitimat.\n[8] M. Smith a de nouveau quitt\u00e9 le travail le 19 f\u00e9vrier 1999. En raison de la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de l'\u00e9tat de M. Smith, le Dr Appleton a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 M. Smith en chirurgie (une discectomie lombaire du disque L5-S1 gauche). M. Smith a \u00e9t\u00e9 op\u00e9r\u00e9 le 12 mars 1999 \u00e0 Vancouver par le Dr Padilla. D'apr\u00e8s M. Smith, la chirurgie a am\u00e9lior\u00e9 son \u00e9tat. La douleur qu'il ressentait \u00e9tait beaucoup moins intense.\n[9] Apr\u00e8s son op\u00e9ration, M. Smith a tent\u00e9 d'appliquer un certain nombre de plans de retour au travail, \u00e9labor\u00e9s en collaboration avec la WCB et la CN pendant la p\u00e9riode de 2000 \u00e0 2004. Trois des plans visaient \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 M. Smith de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le poste de m\u00e9canicien qu'il avait avant de se blesser. Les deux autres plans pr\u00e9voyaient former M. Smith pour qu'il puisse travailler comme coordonnateur de formation des trains ou comme assistant au coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George. Pour occuper ce poste, M. Smith devait d\u00e9m\u00e9nager de Terrace \u00e0 Prince George.\n[10] Aucun de ces plans de retour au travail n'a connu de succ\u00e8s. M. Smith a cess\u00e9 de travailler comme m\u00e9canicien en mars 2001. Il n'est jamais retourn\u00e9 travailler pour la CN, mais il est toujours sur la liste des employ\u00e9s de la CN, sans paye ni avantages.\nII. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [11] Les questions en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce, telles qu'elles sont d\u00e9finies par M. Smith dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, sont les suivantes :\nLa CN a-t-elle agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers M. Smith en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience et de sa situation familiale en ne prenant pas de mesures d'accommodement lui permettant d'occuper un emploi convenable dans la r\u00e9gion de Terrace? La CN a-t-elle agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire et\/ou a-t-elle exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles envers M. Smith, parce qu'il a maintenu sa plainte, en faisant de fausses d\u00e9clarations \u00e0 la WCB au sujet du caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 des mesures d'accommodement qu'elle lui avait offertes comme m\u00e9canicien de locomotive et comme coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George, en faisant de fausses d\u00e9clarations au sujet des difficult\u00e9s d'ordre m\u00e9dical qu'il \u00e9prouvait pendant sa formation \u00e0 Prince George et en faisant de fausses d\u00e9clarations au sujet de sa capacit\u00e9 de mener \u00e0 bien les deux programmes de coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George? La CN a-t-elle agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire et\/ou a-t-elle exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles envers M. Smith lorsqu'elle a rejet\u00e9 sa demande de pension d'invalidit\u00e9?\n[12] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'argument de M. Smith selon lequel il devait obtenir une mesure d'accommodement \u00e0 Terrace, il s'agit en l'esp\u00e8ce de la troisi\u00e8me instance judiciaire dans laquelle M. Smith soul\u00e8ve cette question. Elle a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans un grief pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le syndicat de M. Smith, la Fraternit\u00e9 des ing\u00e9nieurs de locomotives, le 26 juin 2002. Ce grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 par l'arbitrage le 14 juillet 2003.\n[13] La question a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans l'appel que M. Smith a interjet\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Worker's Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT), qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu le 29 novembre 2005. Dans la d\u00e9cision qu'il a rendue le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2006, le WCAT a aussi rejet\u00e9 l'argument de M. Smith selon lequel la CN devrait lui donner un accommodement \u00e0 Terrace.\n[14] N\u00e9anmoins, M. Smith soul\u00e8ve la m\u00eame question devant le Tribunal.\nIII. D\u00c9CISION [15] J'ai conclu que :\nLa CN a accommod\u00e9 M. Smith en pr\u00e9parant trois programmes de retour au travail modifi\u00e9 pour qu'il puisse reprendre du service comme m\u00e9canicien de locomotive \u00e0 Terrace, et ensuite en lui offrant le poste de coordonnateur ou de coordonnateur adjoint de formation de trains \u00e0 Prince George. La CN n'a pas commis d'acte discriminatoire et n'a pas exerc\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sailles envers M. Smith dans ses interactions avec la WCB. La preuve ne soutient pas la conclusion selon laquelle M. Smith a une invalidit\u00e9 totale et permanente qui l'emp\u00eache de travailler. La CN n'a pas agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire et n'a pas exerc\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sailles envers M. Smith en lui refusant la pension d'invalidit\u00e9.\n[16] La plainte de M. Smith est rejet\u00e9e.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS DE FAIT A. Tentatives de r\u00e9affecter M. Smith au poste qu'il occupait avant de se blesser [17] M. Smith a avis\u00e9 Connie Araujo, la responsable de son dossier \u00e0 la WCB, des difficult\u00e9s qu'il \u00e9prouvait au sujet de son retour au travail. Elle a demand\u00e9 au Dr McDougall, un conseiller m\u00e9dical du WCB, d'examiner la preuve m\u00e9dicale au dossier de M. Smith et de la conseiller quant \u00e0 savoir si M. Smith avait une invalidit\u00e9 fonctionnelle permanente qui l'emp\u00eacherait de retourner au travail comme m\u00e9canicien.\n[18] Dans son rapport du 29 septembre 1999, le Dr McDougall a not\u00e9 que M. Smith avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9prouvait encore des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 s'asseoir, ce qu'il devait faire la majeure partie du temps dans le poste qu'il occupait avant de se blesser. Il ne pouvait pas dire, \u00e0 ce moment, si M. Smith pouvait reprendre son poste de m\u00e9canicien.\n[19] Le Dr McDougall a recommand\u00e9 certaines restrictions de travail pour M. Smith, soit le fait d'\u00e9viter de soulever des charges de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9titive ou de soulever des charges lourdes, d'\u00e9viter d'ex\u00e9cuter des rotations et de se pencher, et de changer de la position assise \u00e0 une position debout, puis de marcher, lorsqu'il travaillait.\n[20] La WCB s'est arrang\u00e9e pour que le WorkAble Centre \u00e0 Terrace vienne visiter le lieu de travail pour examiner les besoins physiques li\u00e9s aux postes de m\u00e9canicien et de conducteur\/serre-freins \u00e0 la CN. Cette mesure a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en partie en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente de M. Smith d'\u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de conducteur\/serre-freins.\n[21] Karen Chasney, une ergoth\u00e9rapeute agr\u00e9\u00e9e travaillant pour WorkAble, a visit\u00e9 le lieu de travail \u00e0 Terrace le 7 octobre 1999. Dans le rapport qu'elle a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le 21 octobre 1999, Mme Chasney a fait une description d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des t\u00e2ches et des responsabilit\u00e9s pour les deux postes. Elle a aussi mentionn\u00e9 les inqui\u00e9tudes dont M. Smith lui avait fait part lors de leur rencontre le 8 octobre 1999, au sujet de son retour au travail au poste de m\u00e9canicien.\n[22] Dans son rapport, Mme Chasney \u00e9tait contre l'id\u00e9e que M. Smith obtienne un poste de chef de train\/serre-freins en raison du risque important qu'il se blesse de nouveau. Elle recommandait que M. Smith reprenne le poste qu'il avait avant de se blesser. Il devait commencer \u00e0 titre de rempla\u00e7ant pour retrouver sa tol\u00e9rance pour le travail et ensuite suivre un programme de retour progressif au travail, qui serait coordonn\u00e9 par la CN, la WCB et lui-m\u00eame. Elle a aussi sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que M. Smith alterne entre une position assise et une position debout lorsqu'il conduisait la locomotive.\n[23] Dans un certain nombre de rapports du m\u00e9decin traitant envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 la WCB entre septembre et novembre 1999, le Dr Appleton a not\u00e9 que M. Smith d\u00e9clarait que ses sympt\u00f4mes n'avaient pas chang\u00e9 et qu'il continuait \u00e0 avoir des probl\u00e8mes lorsqu'il devait rester assis pour une p\u00e9riode prolong\u00e9e. Le Dr Appleton n'\u00e9tait pas certain que M. Smith pourrait suffisamment changer de position lorsqu'il conduisait la locomotive, comme le rapport WorkAble le sugg\u00e8re.\n[24] M. Smith est retourn\u00e9 au travail le 13 d\u00e9cembre 1999, sur une ligne de Terrace \u00e0 Kitimat. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de se rendre \u00e0 Kitimat, mais n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de revenir. Il a plut\u00f4t pris un taxi pour se rendre de Kitimat \u00e0 Terrace.\n[25] Le Dr Appleton a examin\u00e9 M. Smith au d\u00e9but janvier 2000. M. Smith avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ressentait de fortes douleurs lorsqu'il restait assis plus de 20 \u00e0 30 minutes, selon la chaise sur laquelle il \u00e9tait assis. Le Dr Appleton \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Smith ne pouvait plus occuper le poste de m\u00e9canicien en raison des p\u00e9riodes prolong\u00e9es au cours desquelles il devait rester assis.\n[26] Mme Araujo a pris des arrangements pour qu'un autre m\u00e9decin consultant de la WCB, le Dr Naismith, examine M. Smith, ce qu'il a fait le 28 janvier 2000. M. Smith a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au Dr Naismith que les principales exigences physiques de son travail \u00e9taient de s'asseoir et de conduire la locomotive de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire. S'il devait rester assis plus de deux heures, il ressentait des douleurs au dos.\n[27] Le Dr Naismith n'\u00e9tait pas d'avis que la blessure de M. Smith causait une contre-indication m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 toute activit\u00e9 qui entra\u00eenait ses sympt\u00f4mes. Il croyait que la description de M. Smith au sujet de sa tol\u00e9rance limit\u00e9e lorsqu'il \u00e9tait assis \u00e9tait possible sur le plan biologique. Cependant, sa tol\u00e9rance et la douleur qu'il ressentait ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre mesur\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on m\u00e9dicale. Il \u00e9tait d'accord avec le Dr Appleton que M. Smith devait restreindre le temps qu'il \u00e9tait assis en fonction d'un niveau raisonnable de confort.\n[28] Les renvois aux sp\u00e9cialistes se sont poursuivis. Le 17 f\u00e9vrier 2000, le Dr F. Gouws, un conseiller m\u00e9dical de la WCB, a renvoy\u00e9 M. Smith au Dr Wing, un chirurgien orthop\u00e9dique, pour qu'il subisse un autre examen m\u00e9dical. Le Dr Wing a examin\u00e9 M. Smith le 5 mai 2000. Dans son rapport m\u00e9dical, le Dr Wing n'a pas recommand\u00e9 qu'il y ait une autre chirurgie. Il \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Smith pouvait faire un certain type de travail et a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 un programme de retour au travail modifi\u00e9. Si M. Smith ne pouvait plus travailler comme m\u00e9canicien, il faudrait lui trouver un autre poste.\n[29] En juillet 2000, Todd McDonald, un conseiller en r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle de la WCB, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'occuper du dossier de M. Smith. Il voulait mettre en place un programme de retour au travail (PRT) progressif et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Erin Fawcett, une agente pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux r\u00e9clamations de la CN, de communiquer avec les responsables de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la CN pour d\u00e9terminer s'il serait dangereux pour M. Smith de se tenir debout pendant qu'il conduisait la locomotive. Erin Fawcett a confirm\u00e9 que les responsables de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la CN ne pensaient pas que cela poserait un probl\u00e8me en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nB. Premier PRT - D\u00e9cembre 2000 - M\u00e9canicien de locomotive [30] M. McDonald a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la CN d'\u00e9laborer un PRT progressif et la CN a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Karlene Dawson, une sp\u00e9cialiste en kin\u00e9siologie et une professionnelle en gestion de dossiers d'invalidit\u00e9, pour qu'elle s'en charge. Mme Dawson a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un PRT, que la WCB et la CN ont examin\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9.\n[31] Pour pr\u00e9parer le PRT de M. Smith, Mme Dawson a consult\u00e9 le superviseur de M. Smith \u00e0 Terrace au sujet des t\u00e2ches d'un m\u00e9canicien. Elle a examin\u00e9 les renseignements de la WCB au sujet des limites m\u00e9dicales ou des contre-indications quant au retour de M. Smith \u00e0 l'emploi qu'il occupait avant de se blesser et elle a aussi examin\u00e9 le rapport WorkAble du 21 octobre 1999 qui soulignait les exigences physiques de l'emploi et les recommandations pour M. Smith.\n[32] Le 22 ao\u00fbt 2000, Mme Dawson a discut\u00e9 avec M. Smith au sujet du plan de retour au travail qu'elle pr\u00e9parait pour lui. Ils ont parl\u00e9 de ses tol\u00e9rances et de la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle il \u00e9tait capable d'\u00eatre assis ou de rester debout. Il lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait capable de conduire pendant environ deux heures \u00e0 la fois et qu'il faisait environ cinq heures d'exercice \u00e0 la maison \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Il lui a aussi dit que, tant qu'il continuait ses exercices, son dos ne lui faisait pas si mal.\n[33] Mme Dawson a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le PRT \u00e0 M. Smith le 8 septembre 2000. Elle lui a demand\u00e9 d'examiner le plan et de lui faire parvenir ses commentaires et ses pr\u00e9occupations. Il pensait que c'\u00e9tait un plan un peu trop agressif et il n'\u00e9tait pas certain qu'il serait capable de le suivre. Mme Dawson \u00e9tait surprise. Elle croyait que les renseignements qu'elle avait, ainsi que les tol\u00e9rances dont M. Smith lui avait parl\u00e9, concordaient avec le PRT.\n[34] M. Smith a vu le Dr Wing de nouveau le 23 octobre 2000. Mme Araujo avait envoy\u00e9 le PRT de M. Smith au Dr Wing et lui avait demand\u00e9 ses commentaires. Le Dr Wing \u00e9tait d'avis que le plan \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait appropri\u00e9 pour M. Smith. Il a recommand\u00e9 que M. Smith bouge et change de position de temps en temps pendant son travail.\n[35] Le PRT devait d\u00e9buter le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2000. M. Smith effectuerait deux voyages par semaine pour les deux premi\u00e8res semaines du plan. Il aurait trois jours de cong\u00e9 pendant ces semaines pour qu'il puisse se reposer et continuer \u00e0 faire ses exercices \u00e0 la maison.\n[36] Sa semaine de travail augmenterait progressivement de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu'un voyage suppl\u00e9mentaire soit ajout\u00e9 chaque semaine. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, M. Smith serait la quatri\u00e8me personne dans une \u00e9quipe compos\u00e9e de trois membres, ce qui signifie qu'il ne serait pas le principal responsable de la conduite de la locomotive. Le plan pr\u00e9cisait aussi qu'il devrait alterner la position assise avec la position debout.\n[37] Selon le plan, M. Smith devait tenir un journal de sa situation et le t\u00e9l\u00e9copier chaque semaine aux Services de sant\u00e9 au travail de la CN. Il devait inscrire ses t\u00e2ches, tout sympt\u00f4me physique et si les sympt\u00f4mes augmentaient ou diminuaient, afin que la CN puisse apporter les modifications n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 son poste.\n[38] Le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2000, Mme Dawson a \u00e9crit au Dr Appleton au sujet des spasmes que M. Smith disait ressentir lorsqu'il conduisait la locomotive. Dans sa lettre, elle a inclus le PRT de M. Smith et une analyse des exigences physiques du poste de m\u00e9canicien. Elle a demand\u00e9 l'avis du Dr Appleton au sujet des spasmes et de la question \u00e0 savoir si les spasmes \u00e9taient caus\u00e9s par un \u00e9tat pathologique sous-jacent qui pouvait affecter son emploi \u00e0 titre de m\u00e9canicien de locomotive.\n[39] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse du 19 d\u00e9cembre 2000, le Dr Appleton a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que M. Smith \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat de reprendre le travail de fa\u00e7on progressive, comme l'indiquait le plan, et que son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 \u00e9tait stable. Le Dr Appleton a aussi sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que M. Smith puisse se d\u00e9placer de fa\u00e7on plus fr\u00e9quente et a rappel\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait contre-indiqu\u00e9 qu'il reste assis de fa\u00e7on prolong\u00e9e.\n[40] M. Smith est retourn\u00e9 au travail le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2000. Le 12, le 14 et le 19 d\u00e9cembre, il a travaill\u00e9 sur la ligne de Terrace \u00e0 Kitimat en alternant la position assise avec la position debout. Le 21 d\u00e9cembre, il n'a fait que le voyage d'aller.\n[41] Le 28 d\u00e9cembre 2000, M. Smith devait faire le voyage \u00e0 Kitimat. Alors qu'il s'est assis dans la locomotive en attendant de partir, il a ressenti des spasmes aigus. Il a d\u00fb sortir de la locomotive et s'\u00e9tendre sur le plancher du poste de triage. Sa femme est venue le chercher et l'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9, a re\u00e7u des m\u00e9dicaments et est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison.\n[42] M. Smith a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de faire le voyage de retour de Terrace \u00e0 Kitimat le 29 d\u00e9cembre. Cependant, dans le voyage Terrace\/Kitimat du 2 janvier 2001, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ses spasmes \u00e9taient tellement fr\u00e9quents et aigus qu'il ne pouvait pas faire le voyage de retour. Il a pris un taxi jusqu'\u00e0 Terrace et est rest\u00e9 allong\u00e9 sur le banc arri\u00e8re tout le long du voyage. M. Smith a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de terminer son PRT.\n[43] Le 24 janvier 2001, on a demand\u00e9 l'opinion m\u00e9dicale du Dr Trent Faraday, conseiller m\u00e9dical de la WCB, quant \u00e0 savoir s'il y avait eu des changements importants dans l'\u00e9tat m\u00e9dical de M. Smith depuis janvier 2000. Il a r\u00e9pondu le 25 janvier 2001 qu'il n'y avait pas eu de changement dans l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de M. Smith.\n[44] Le Dr Faraday a aussi confirm\u00e9 les restrictions en mati\u00e8re de travail physique de M. Smith :\n\u00e9viter de soulever des poids de plus de 30 livres;\n\u00e9viter de rester assis pour des p\u00e9riodes prolong\u00e9es;\n\u00e9viter les t\u00e2ches qui l'obligent \u00e0 pousser, \u00e0 tirer, \u00e0 transporter des poids et \u00e0 se pencher de fa\u00e7on excessive;\navoir la possibilit\u00e9 de changer de la position assise \u00e0 la position debout et de marcher lorsqu'il en ressent le besoin.\n[45] Le Dr Faraday a conclu que M. Smith devait terminer le PRT \u00e9labor\u00e9 par Mme Dawson et approuv\u00e9 par le Dr Wing.\nC. Deuxi\u00e8me PRT - Mars 2001 - M\u00e9canicien de locomotive [46] Avant l'\u00e9laboration du PRT de d\u00e9cembre 2000, M. Smith avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la CN de lui donner un poste de m\u00e9canicien dans le parc \u00e0 mat\u00e9riel remorqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Terrace. Apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9chec du premier PRT, et en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la suggestion de M. Smith, Mme Dawson a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un nouveau plan. La WCB n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration du plan. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de la CN.\n[47] Ce PRT pr\u00e9voyait que M. Smith travaillerait dans le parc \u00e0 mat\u00e9riel remorqu\u00e9, il travaillerait deux heures sur la locomotive de gare de triage et une heure dans le poste de triage. Il serait un employ\u00e9 de surplus et il devrait essayer d'effectuer le plus de t\u00e2ches possible pour la dur\u00e9e du plan.\n[48] Il s'agissait d'un plan de transition, selon lequel M. Smith devait graduellement augmenter le nombre d'heures et de quarts qu'il faisait chaque semaine. M. Smith pouvait prendre des pauses s'il en avait besoin puisqu'il \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 de surplus dans l'\u00e9quipe.\n[49] Le PRT devait d\u00e9buter en mars 2001 et devait durer de deux \u00e0 quatre semaines. Le Dr Coppin, un conseiller m\u00e9dical, a \u00e9crit au Dr Appleton et lui a fait parvenir une copie du PRT. Le Dr Coppin a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que ce PRT pr\u00e9voyait des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es et se limitait au travail dans le parc local, ce qui \u00e9viterait \u00e0 M. Smith de se trouver dans la cabine de commande d'une locomotive pendant des p\u00e9riodes prolong\u00e9es. Il a demand\u00e9 l'appui du Dr Appleton, qui a approuv\u00e9 le plan.\n[50] Le 6 mars 2001, le Dr Appleton a \u00e9crit dans ses notes cliniques que M. Smith, son repr\u00e9sentant syndical et les repr\u00e9sentants de la CN s'\u00e9taient rencontr\u00e9s et s'\u00e9taient entendus sur un autre PRT qui ne comprenait pas de travail m\u00e9canique important. Le Dr Appleton a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une offre raisonnable et en a discut\u00e9 longuement avec M. Smith.\n[51] M. Smith a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le PRT le 1er mars 2001. Cependant, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de le terminer. Le 28 mars 2001, Mme Dawson, M. Smith, son repr\u00e9sentant syndical, Wayne Wiederspiel, et le surintendant de la CN \u00e0 Terrace, Darren Payment, se sont rencontr\u00e9s. Lors de cette rencontre, ils ont discut\u00e9 du fait que M. Smith ne faisait pas vraiment de progr\u00e8s. Il avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire la locomotive et il \u00e9tait incapable de continuer au rythme qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu par le PRT. Ils ont tous convenu que le PRT devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9.\n[52] M. Smith a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il n'avait aucun probl\u00e8me avec les t\u00e2ches qu'on lui avait attribu\u00e9es dans le parc \u00e0 mat\u00e9riel remorqu\u00e9, mais la t\u00e2che de faire fonctionner la locomotive de gare de triage lui causait des difficult\u00e9s. Il ressentait des douleurs et des spasmes musculaires lorsqu'il d\u00fb augmenter ses heures de travail dans la locomotive.\n[53] Apr\u00e8s la rencontre du 28 mars 2001, M. Wiederspiel a offert des suggestions \u00e0 Mme Dawson qui pourraient aider M. Smith \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 l'emploi qu'il avait avant de se blesser. Ces suggestions comprenaient l'ajout d'un tapis en caoutchouc dans la locomotive pour diminuer les vibrations du moteur et le retrait du dossier du si\u00e8ge de conducteur pour que M. Smith puisse s'agenouiller sur le si\u00e8ge lorsqu'il conduisait. Il a aussi recommand\u00e9 que M. Smith prenne des pauses pour se reposer. M. Wiederspiel a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la CN de remettre en application le PRT de mars et d'y ajouter certaines de ses suggestions.\nD. Troisi\u00e8me PRT - Avril 2001 - M\u00e9canicien de locomotive [54] La CN a accept\u00e9 la demande de M. Wiederspiel. Mme Dawson a \u00e9labor\u00e9 un autre PRT avec l'aide de M. Wiederspiel. Le PRT pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 afin d'ajouter un tapis de caoutchouc, de garantir que M. Smith avait des bottes de protection confortables qui lui donnaient un soutien ad\u00e9quat lorsqu'il travaillait, de permettre \u00e0 M. Smith d'\u00eatre assis, debout ou \u00e0 genoux quand il en ressentait le besoin et de retirer le dossier du si\u00e8ge dans la cabine de commande de la locomotive.\n[55] Mme Dawson a envoy\u00e9 une copie de ce PRT \u00e0 M. Smith le 26 avril 2001. Il a examin\u00e9 le plan et a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Dawson ses commentaires, qui comprenaient certaines modifications que Mme Dawson a ajout\u00e9es au plan.\n[56] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, M. Smith n'a jamais mentionn\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de terminer ce PRT. En fait, dans sa lettre \u00e0 Mme Dawson, il a clairement laiss\u00e9 entendre qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 suivre ce PRT.\n[57] Mme Dawson a aussi envoy\u00e9 une copie au Dr Appleton le 26 avril 2001. Elle lui a expliqu\u00e9 les modifications et lui a demand\u00e9 son appui. Le 22 mai, le Dr Appleton a r\u00e9pondu qu'il croyait que la cabine de la locomotive \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre trop petite pour permettre \u00e0 M. Smith de varier sa posture. Il avait des doutes quant \u00e0 savoir si l'\u00e9tat de M. Smith allait s'am\u00e9liorer et il se demandait si M. Smith ne devrait pas se trouver un autre emploi. Le Dr Appleton a rejet\u00e9 le plan et M. Smith ne l'a jamais commenc\u00e9.\n(i) R\u00e9union du 12 juillet 2001 Tentative de r\u00e9gler la situation de M. Smith [58] Le 14 juin 2001, le Dr Appleton a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Ken Beddie, gestionnaire du bureau de la WCB \u00e0 Terrace, lui demandant d'organiser une r\u00e9union pour essayer de r\u00e9gler la situation de M. Smith. Il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Araujo de le faire, mais elle avait refus\u00e9. Le Dr Appleton a \u00e9crit qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 indign\u00e9 de cette r\u00e9ponse, et c'est pourquoi il \u00e9crivait \u00e0 Ken Beddie. \u00c0 titre de m\u00e9decin, il \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Smith ne pouvait pas reprendre son poste de m\u00e9canicien puisqu'il devait rester debout ou assis pendant de trop longues p\u00e9riodes. Il croyait qu'une r\u00e9union \u00e9tait la seule fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9gler la situation.\n[59] Une rencontre a eu lieu le 12 juillet 2001 \u00e0 Terrace, qui r\u00e9unissait M. Smith et le Dr Appleton, Karlene Dawson, Murray Swanson, le Dr Faraday et le Dr Vaney, tous de la CN, et Ken Beddie, Connie Araujo et Vivien Millin, une conseill\u00e8re en r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle.\n[60] Ils ont discut\u00e9 des tentatives infructueuses de r\u00e9affecter M. Smith au poste qu'il occupait avant de se blesser. Mme Dawson a expliqu\u00e9 que la CN et le syndicat cherchaient un autre poste pour M. Smith, mais qu'en raison de coupures dans la r\u00e9gion, il n'y avait pas d'ouvertures. Cependant, si M. Smith \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, la CN serait en mesure de lui offrir un poste diff\u00e9rent.\n[61] Le 30 mars 2001, le Dr Appleton avait \u00e9crit au Dr Clarke, un neurologue, pour lui demander d'\u00e9valuer M. Smith. Il a demand\u00e9 au Dr Clarke s'il \u00e9tait capable de trouver une cause physiologique ou psychologique aux sympt\u00f4mes de M. Smith.\n[62] M. Smith a vu le Dr Clarke le 11 juillet 2001, mais il n'avait pas encore envoy\u00e9 son rapport m\u00e9dical au Dr Appleton. Les gens pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la r\u00e9union voulaient attendre les r\u00e9sultats du rapport et ils ont aussi convenu qu'il serait utile que M. Smith subisse une \u00e9valuation des capacit\u00e9s fonctionnelles.\n[63] La CN devait payer pour cette \u00e9valuation, elle devait organiser la tenue de l'\u00e9valuation.\n(ii) \u00c9valuation du Dr Clarke [64] Dans son rapport du 11 juillet 2001, le Dr Clarke a not\u00e9 un certain nombre de conclusions m\u00e9dicales au sujet de M. Smith. Ces conclusions comprenaient les pr\u00e9occupations dont M. Smith lui avait fait part, soit les spasmes qu'il ressentait au dos de fa\u00e7on intermittente depuis 1997. M. Smith a expliqu\u00e9 au Dr Clarke que ses spasmes apparaissaient lorsqu'il \u00e9tait assis pendant des p\u00e9riodes de 20 \u00e0 60 minutes, selon la chaise, ou s'il restait debout pendant des p\u00e9riodes de 30 \u00e0 60 minutes. Il a aussi dit au Dr Clarke que s'il ne s'assoyait pas ou qu'il ne restait pas debout pendant des p\u00e9riodes prolong\u00e9es, il ressentait tr\u00e8s peu de spasmes. Il se traitait lui-m\u00eame en se couchant sur le dos, sur un coussin chauffant et disait que cela fonctionnait tr\u00e8s bien. Il a aussi expliqu\u00e9 au Dr Clarke qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s actif, il marchait de sa r\u00e9sidence jusqu'\u00e0 la piscine, il faisait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement environ 40 longueurs \u00e0 la nage et il jardinait.\n[65] L'\u00e9valuation du Dr Clarke a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l'examen neurologique de M. Smith \u00e9tait normal et qu'il n'y avait pas beaucoup de points non organiques. S'il g\u00e9rait attentivement ses activit\u00e9s et qu'il ne restait pas assis ou debout pour des p\u00e9riodes prolong\u00e9es, il \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t confortable et \u00e9tait capable de fonctionner de fa\u00e7on plut\u00f4t normale.\n[66] Le Dr Clarke a conclu que, compte tenu des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de M. Smith depuis 1997 en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ses spasmes et du fait que son travail exige qu'il soit assis ou debout pendant des p\u00e9riodes prolong\u00e9es, il \u00e9tait peu probable qu'il soit capable de retourner au poste qu'il avait avant de se blesser. Il \u00e9tait donc un bon candidat pour une nouvelle formation.\n[67] Dans ses notes cliniques du 14 f\u00e9vrier 2002, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation du Dr Clarke, le Dr Appleton a not\u00e9 que ni lui, ni le Dr Clarke n'\u00e9taient en mesure de d\u00e9couvrir la cause et la nature exactes des spasmes musculaires de M. Smith.\n(iii) Offre d'emploi temporaire de la CN - 16 juillet 2001 [68] Tant le Dr Appleton que M. Smith \u00e9taient pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s par le fait que M. Smith n'avait pas gagn\u00e9 de revenu depuis un certain temps. Rob Reny, le cadre de direction des Ressources humaines pour l'Ouest du Canada, a discut\u00e9 de nombreuses fois avec Dan Shewchuk, le vice-pr\u00e9sident du syndicat, au sujet des programmes de retour au travail de M. Smith et des prochaines mesures qui devaient \u00eatre prises.\n[69] Lors de la r\u00e9union du 12 juillet 2001, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la CN si elle pouvait offrir \u00e0 M. Smith un emploi de courte dur\u00e9e, en attendant l'\u00e9valuation du Dr Clarke, afin de soulager les probl\u00e8mes financiers de M. Smith.\n[70] La CN lui a offert un emploi de trois semaines dans le parc \u00e0 Terrace et M. Swanson lui a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il devait se pr\u00e9senter au travail le 16 juillet 2001.\n[71] M. Smith a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Swanson plus tard le m\u00eame jour pour lui demander un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches propos\u00e9es. Il lui a demand\u00e9 ce r\u00e9sum\u00e9 parce qu'il voulait que le Dr Appleton approuve les t\u00e2ches qu'on lui attribuerait. Comme le Dr Appleton \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 la r\u00e9union lors de laquelle on a discut\u00e9 de l'emploi de courte dur\u00e9e, il n'est pas tr\u00e8s clair pourquoi M. Smith a fait cette demande.\n[72] M. Swanson a envoy\u00e9 un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 par courriel \u00e0 M. Smith le 16 juillet 2001. Les t\u00e2ches comprenaient du travail s\u00e9dentaire de bureau, l'inventaire des fournitures de bureau et de papeterie, la conduite d'un v\u00e9hicule dans le parc d'une dur\u00e9e allant de vingt minutes \u00e0 deux heures avec la possibilit\u00e9 de sortir du v\u00e9hicule pour s'\u00e9tirer pendant les arr\u00eats et la marche pour aider \u00e0 inspecter les trains dans le parc, marche qui ne d\u00e9passerait pas une distance d'un kilom\u00e8tre.\n[73] M. Smith ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail le 16 juillet. M. Swanson a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith le 16 juillet et a laiss\u00e9 un message sur son r\u00e9pondeur dans lequel il pr\u00e9cisait qu'il lui avait envoy\u00e9 le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches. Il a aussi laiss\u00e9 un message sur le r\u00e9pondeur le 10 ao\u00fbt dans lequel il lui demandait de le rappeler pour lui expliquer pourquoi il ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail.\n[74] Au d\u00e9part, M. Smith a dit \u00e0 la CN qu'il n'avait pas re\u00e7u le courriel de M. Swanson avant le 23 ao\u00fbt et qu'il ne se souvenait pas d'avoir re\u00e7u des messages de M. Swanson sur son r\u00e9pondeur.\n[75] \u00c0 l'audience devant le Tribunal, M. Smith a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 honn\u00eate envers la CN. Il avait bien re\u00e7u la liste de t\u00e2ches par courriel le 16 juillet et il avait re\u00e7u au moins un des messages de M. Swanson. En fait, il \u00e9tait en vacances avec sa femme et il n'est revenu qu'\u00e0 la fin ao\u00fbt. M. Smith ne voulait pas que la CN sache qu'il \u00e9tait parti en vacances avec sa femme au lieu de se pr\u00e9senter au travail.\n(iv) \u00c9valuation des capacit\u00e9s fonctionnelles de M. Smith - Octobre\/novembre 2002 [76] L'\u00e9valuation des capacit\u00e9s fonctionnelles de M. Smith a eu lieu le 3, le 8 et le 21 octobre 2002. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e par Julie Veilleux, une ergoth\u00e9rapeute. Mme Veilleux a examin\u00e9 la capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle et les capacit\u00e9s physiques de M. Smith. Elle a visit\u00e9 le lieu de travail deux fois pour v\u00e9rifier les t\u00e2ches et les exigences physiques du poste de m\u00e9canicien de locomotive.\n[77] La premi\u00e8re visite des lieux a \u00e9t\u00e9 au parc \u00e0 Terrace et comprenait un voyage de Kitimat \u00e0 Terrace dans une locomotive. La deuxi\u00e8me visite a eu lieu au parc Thornton de la CN \u00e0 Vancouver. L'objectif \u00e9tait d'examiner d'autres types de locomotives de la CN.\n[78] Dans son rapport d'\u00e9valuation professionnelle du 6 novembre 2002, Mme Veilleux a conclu que les capacit\u00e9s physiques de M. Smith correspondaient bien aux exigences physiques du poste de m\u00e9canicien. Cependant, elle a tir\u00e9 la conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure de d\u00e9terminer, avec un degr\u00e9 raisonnable de confiance, si M. Smith \u00e9tait capable de travailler comme m\u00e9canicien \u00e0 temps plein. Elle a not\u00e9 que M. Smith avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de terminer avec succ\u00e8s trois PRT. Il n'y avait cependant aucune preuve objective permettant d'expliquer ce fait. Elle a propos\u00e9 un autre PRT, qui serait surveill\u00e9 de pr\u00e8s par des professionnels en r\u00e9adaptation m\u00e9dicale.\n(v) Autres possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi \u00e0 Terrace [79] Pendant la p\u00e9riode d'avril 2001 \u00e0 mai 2003, des discussions avec la CN ont eu lieu au sujet d'autres possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi pour M. Smith \u00e0 Terrace. On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Daryl Payment, surintendant de l'exploitation \u00e0 Terrace, s'il \u00e9tait possible de donner \u00e0 M. Smith un poste dans le service de navettes pour les \u00e9quipes de train. Il a r\u00e9pondu que, comme il y avait un nombre limit\u00e9 de trains en fonction dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique, il ne s'agissait pas d'une solution viable. M. Payment ne voyait pas quel autre poste il pouvait trouver pour M. Smith \u00e0 Terrace.\n[80] En f\u00e9vrier 2003, M. Smith a discut\u00e9 avec Judy McKenzie, une agente du personnel \u00e0 la CN, au sujet de possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi \u00e0 Terrace. Il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il pouvait conduire les \u00e9quipes de train dans le complexe ferroviaire de Terrace, monter un site Web pour la CN ou faire du travail \u00e0 l'ordinateur, ou mettre sur pied un programme au sujet de l'Op\u00e9ration Gareautrain pour les \u00e9coles locales.\n[81] La CN \u00e9tait d'avis que le complexe ferroviaire de Terrace \u00e9tait petit et ne poss\u00e9dait pas suffisamment de bureaux ou de postes s\u00e9dentaires qui r\u00e9pondaient aux restrictions de M. Smith. Compte tenu de la baisse de l'activit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique dans la r\u00e9gion de Terrace, le niveau d'achalandage de la CN avait grandement diminu\u00e9. Beaucoup des postes autres que la conduite des locomotives avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9s ou transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 des complexes ferroviaires plus grands comme ceux de Prince George, d'Edmonton ou de Vancouver.\n[82] En ce qui a trait au montage d'un site Web, les sites Web de la CN sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par un fournisseur de services externe ou par le groupe de la Technologie de l'information (TI) du CN \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\n[83] La CN avait un contrat avec un service de taxis pour transporter les \u00e9quipes dans le terminal. Ce travail exigeait de l'employ\u00e9 qu'il reste assis pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes. De plus, ce type de poste ne pouvait pas devenir un emploi \u00e0 temps plein.\n[84] Les responsables de l'exploitation \u00e0 Terrace et l'\u00e9quipe de retour au travail de M. Smith, toutes des personnes qui poss\u00e9daient de l'exp\u00e9rience et des connaissances au sujet de l'exploitation de la CN \u00e0 Terrace, avaient examin\u00e9 attentivement toutes les possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi \u00e0 Terrace. Il n'y avait aucun poste qui pouvait convenir \u00e0 M. Smith, sauf si un poste, qui autrement ne serait pas n\u00e9cessaire, \u00e9tait cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour lui.\n[85] L'objectif de la CN \u00e9tait de trouver un emploi r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 et \u00e0 temps plein pour M. Smith qu'il pourrait occuper \u00e0 long terme, et non de cr\u00e9er des projets de travail. Les suggestions de M. Smith au sujet d'un emploi \u00e0 Terrace ne pouvaient pas se traduire par un emploi constructif \u00e0 long terme.\nE. Appel de M. Smith \u00e0 la commission de r\u00e9vision de la WCB - D\u00e9cision - 14 mars 2003 [86] En janvier 2002, M. Smith a interjet\u00e9 appel au tribunal de r\u00e9vision de la WCB au sujet d'un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions que les agents de la WCB avaient prises quant \u00e0 sa demande d'indemnisation. Parmi les questions que le tribunal de r\u00e9vision devait trancher, il devait d\u00e9terminer si un emploi modifi\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de m\u00e9canicien de locomotive pouvait convenir \u00e0 M. Smith. Le tribunal de r\u00e9vision a conclu dans sa d\u00e9cision du 14 mars 2003 que l'emploi que M. Smith occupait avant de se blesser, m\u00eame modifi\u00e9, ne convenait pas compte tenu de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 indemnisable.\n[87] Le tribunal a conclu que l'emploi id\u00e9al pour M. Smith lui permettrait d'\u00eatre assis, de se tenir debout et de marcher lorsqu'il en ressentait le besoin. Un conducteur de locomotive a tr\u00e8s peu l'occasion de marcher et s'il se tient debout, il ne peut le faire que d'une fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e.\n[88] Le tribunal de r\u00e9vision a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith des prestations de r\u00e9habilitation professionnelle et une compensation pour la perte de revenu. Il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la WCB et \u00e0 la CN le choix de trouver \u00e0 M. Smith un autre poste au sein de la CN ou de le former pour un autre emploi.\nF. PRT - juin et juillet 2003 - Coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George [89] Le 15 avril 2003, peu de temps apr\u00e8s que le tribunal de r\u00e9vision de la WCB ait rendu sa d\u00e9cision, Todd McDonald, un conseiller en r\u00e9habilitation professionnelle \u00e0 Terrace, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Tom Brown, surintendant de l'exploitation de la CN \u00e0 Prince George.\n[90] Il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que la WCB et la CN visent la r\u00e9habilitation professionnelle pour M. Smith dans le cadre des restrictions de travail que le conseiller m\u00e9dical de la WCB a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es.\n[91] M. Brown \u00e0 r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. McDonald le 7 mai 2003. Il offrait de former M. Smith comme coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George (Colombie-Britannique). Cela comprenait de la formation technique \u00e0 Vancouver et de la formation sur les lieux \u00e0 Prince George. Il croyait que le poste offrirait \u00e0 M. Smith une stabilit\u00e9 d'emploi optimale. Il a aussi not\u00e9 que cet emploi \u00e9tait en majeure partie un emploi s\u00e9dentaire qui respectait bien les restrictions de travail de M. Smith.\nG. Quatri\u00e8me PRT - Coordonnateur de formation des trains - Prince George, juin et juillet 2003 [92] Tanya Gordon, qui \u00e9tait alors coordonnatrice du retour au travail pour la CN, a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un autre plan transitionnel de retour au travail pour M. Smith, cette fois dans le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George. Mme Gordon est une sp\u00e9cialiste agr\u00e9\u00e9e en kin\u00e9siologie qui se sp\u00e9cialise en r\u00e9habilitation professionnelle et en gestion des limitations fonctionnelles.\n[93] Le PRT pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la CN pr\u00e9voyait des s\u00e9ances de formation, au parc Thornton \u00e0 Vancouver pour la formation technique du 2 au 27 juin 2003, et \u00e0 Prince George du 29 juin au 28 juillet pour la formation pratique sur les lieux de travail.\n[94] Pour \u00e9laborer le PRT, Mme Gordon a tenu compte de certains facteurs, tels que les restrictions de travail de M. Smith d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par la WCB, les exigences physiques et les conditions de travail, l'analyse d'emploi pour le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains et l'\u00e9valuation des capacit\u00e9s fonctionnelles de M. Smith effectu\u00e9e en octobre 2002.\n(i) T\u00e2ches du coordonnateur de formation des trains [95] Les coordonnateurs de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George sont enti\u00e8rement responsables du fonctionnement du parc de Prince George. Ils contr\u00f4lent la r\u00e9partition des trains qui arrivent \u00e0 la gare et la composition des trains qui quittent la gare. Ils dirigent les \u00e9quipes pour ces op\u00e9rations. Ils servent de personnes-ressources pour toutes les questions des clients et de personnes \u00e0 contacter en cas d'urgence au sein de la gare de Prince George.\n[96] Les coordonnateurs de formation des trains travaillent dans un bureau. Ils peuvent \u00eatre assis ou rester debout \u00e0 leur bureau. Compte tenu de la libert\u00e9 de mouvements qu'offrent les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones cellulaires et les radios portatives, ils n'ont pas besoin de toujours rester \u00e0 leur bureau. Ils peuvent sortir dans le parc et prendre des pauses, mais ils doivent toujours avoir leur radio ou leur t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec eux.\n[97] L'\u00e9quipement utilis\u00e9 par les coordonnateurs de formation des trains comprend un ordinateur branch\u00e9 au r\u00e9seau de la CN, une radio portative, une radio \u00e0 leur bureau, un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire et plusieurs \u00e9crans au-dessus de leur bureau pour surveiller le fonctionnement du parc gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des cam\u00e9ras.\n[98] Les t\u00e2ches physiques d'un coordonnateur de formation des trains comprennent l'entr\u00e9e de donn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'ordinateur, la lecture de donn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran d'ordinateur, la surveillance des \u00e9crans et l'utilisation de la radio ou du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Ces t\u00e2ches peuvent \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es en position assise ou debout.\n[99] L'objet le plus lourd qu'un coordonnateur de formation des trains a \u00e0 lever est un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Il s'agit de l'emploi le plus s\u00e9dentaire de tous les emplois des chemins de fer de la CN.\n[100] Le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains est un poste essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il sert de personne-contact pour toute urgence dans le parc ou pour tout probl\u00e8me qui pourrait survenir pour les \u00e9quipes de ligne dans la r\u00e9gion. Pour cette raison, il est essentiel que le coordonnateur puisse \u00eatre rejoint \u00e0 tout moment pendant son quart de travail.\n(ii) Pr\u00e9occupations de M. Smith au sujet du PRT pour le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains [101] Au d\u00e9part, M. Smith \u00e9tait contre cette proposition. Il a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. McDonald qu'il aimerait que la CN tente de lui donner un poste \u00e0 Terrace avant qu'il pense \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Prince George. L'une des raisons justifiant cette demande \u00e9tait que son \u00e9pouse tenait beaucoup \u00e0 son propre emploi et qu'elle ne voudrait pas d\u00e9m\u00e9nager.\n[102] Avant l'application du plan, Mme Gordon avait discut\u00e9 avec M. Smith. Il avait certaines r\u00e9serves au sujet de la date de d\u00e9but du plan, il trouvait que c'\u00e9tait trop rapide et il avait des engagements avec sa famille en juin, alors il devait se trouver \u00e0 Terrace. Il avait aussi des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont la formation se d\u00e9roulerait et au sujet du fait qu'elle aurait lieu \u00e0 Vancouver et non \u00e0 Terrace.\n[103] Mme Gordon a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith que le mat\u00e9riel et le personnel de formation se trouvaient seulement au parc Thornton. L'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces ressources \u00e9tait essentiel.\n[104] Elle a aussi expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith qu'il serait pay\u00e9 au taux horaire d'un coordonnateur de formation des trains pendant sa formation et que la CN s'attendait \u00e0 ce qu'il soit sur les lieux huit heures par jour. S'il n'\u00e9tait pas en formation, il devait \u00eatre \u00e0 la salle d'entra\u00eenement pour suivre son programme d'exercices.\n[105] La CN paierait son logement, son transport \u00e0 partir de Terrace et pour y retourner, ainsi qu'une indemnit\u00e9 journali\u00e8re pour couvrir ses d\u00e9penses. En ce qui a trait aux engagements de M. Smith en juin, Mme Gordon a ajust\u00e9 le calendrier pour qu'il puisse \u00eatre \u00e0 Terrace comme pr\u00e9vu.\nH. Formation technique - Coordonnateur de formation des trains - Parc Thornton - Vancouver, juin 2003 [106] M. Smith a finalement accept\u00e9 de suivre le PRT, mais il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 soutenir que la CN devrait lui trouver un poste \u00e0 Terrace.\n[107] Le syndicat, quant \u00e0 lui, a accept\u00e9 que M. Smith \u00e9tait capable de travailler comme coordonnateur de formation des trains. Le syndicat a cependant demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la CN, sans doute \u00e0 la demande de M. Smith, que ce dernier obtienne un poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Terrace.\n[108] La CN ne pouvait pas le faire. Il n'y avait aucun besoin op\u00e9rationnel \u00e0 Terrace pour un coordonnateur de formation des trains. Le coordonnateur de Prince George s'occupe de la gare de Terrace et le coordonnateur d'Edmonton contr\u00f4le les d\u00e9placements sur les rails des autres centres \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de Prince George et de Vancouver.\n[109] En plus du manque de besoin op\u00e9rationnel, il n'\u00e9tait pas possible que la CN ait un seul coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Terrace puisqu'il s'agit d'un poste essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, qui n\u00e9cessite une pr\u00e9sence tous les jours 24 heures sur 24.\n[110] M. McDonald, s'exprimant pour la WCB, \u00e9tait en faveur de la formation de M. Smith pour le poste \u00e0 Prince George et il a encourag\u00e9 M. Smith \u00e0 accepter le poste. Mme Gordon avait fourni une copie du PRT \u00e0 M. McDonald, qui l'avait approuv\u00e9.\n(i) Premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du PRT - Parc Thornton \u00e0 Vancouver [111] Le PRT \u00e9tait divis\u00e9 en deux \u00e9tapes : la formation en classe au parc Thornton et la formation pratique \u00e0 Prince George.\n[112] Pendant la premi\u00e8re semaine, M. Smith devait faire six heures de formation. Il avait beaucoup de temps pour se lever, prendre des pauses, marcher un peu et changer de positions lorsqu'il en ressentait le besoin. Il avait deux heures par jour pour utiliser le centre de conditionnement physique des employ\u00e9s, qui se trouve \u00e0 distance de marche du bureau.\n[113] M. Smith devait commencer sa journ\u00e9e \u00e0 8 h 30 et la terminer \u00e0 14 h 30, journ\u00e9e qui augmenterait \u00e0 huit heures les mardis et jeudis de la deuxi\u00e8me semaine. Cela lui permettrait d'augmenter sa tol\u00e9rance et son endurance pour les quarts de travail de huit heures.\n[114] La WCB devait donner l'approbation finale au sujet du PRT et la d\u00e9cision finale quant au caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 du poste. M. McDonald a demand\u00e9 des rapports hebdomadaires \u00e0 Mme Gordon au sujet de l'\u00e9volution du plan et des probl\u00e8mes qui pouvaient se pr\u00e9senter et auxquels la WCB devrait r\u00e9pondre.\n[115] M. Smith a commenc\u00e9 sa formation le 2 juin 2003. Le 6 juin 2003, Mme Gordon a rencontr\u00e9 M. Smith. Il lui a dit qu'il croyait qu'il ne recevait pas la bonne formation, puisqu'il ne s'agissait pas d'une formation en classe. Elle lui a expliqu\u00e9 que la WCB voulait acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer son retour au travail, que la formation en classe ne se donnait qu'une fois par ann\u00e9e et qu'il recevrait la formation compl\u00e8te pour devenir coordonnateur de formation des trains.\n[116] M. Smith a obtenu les modules de formation pour le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains et a eu un acc\u00e8s direct \u00e0 un gestionnaire qui connaissait bien le mat\u00e9riel. Il a aussi obtenu l'acc\u00e8s au syst\u00e8me informatique qu'il allait utiliser lorsqu'il commencerait son emploi comme coordonnateur.\n[117] M. Smith a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui donne une chaise appropri\u00e9e pour ses probl\u00e8mes de dos. La CN lui a offert plusieurs chaises qui se trouvaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans le bureau, y compris une chaise de r\u00e9ceptionniste, une chaise de dactylo, une chaise Obusforme \u00e0 dossier haut, mais il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d'en trouver une qui lui convenait.\n[118] M. Smith \u00e9tait d'avis que la CN n'avait pas fait des efforts suffisants pour essayer de lui trouver une chaise ad\u00e9quate. Il a m\u00eame offert d'accompagner un agent de la CN \u00e0 un magasin sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 pour y trouver une chaise. Cependant, il ne le ferait que pendant les heures de travail, pas apr\u00e8s la fin de son quart. Il a finalement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la CN de transporter sa chaise personnelle de sa maison jusqu'\u00e0 Vancouver, ce que la CN a fait.\n[119] D'apr\u00e8s la CN, les chaises qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 offertes \u00e9taient toutes des chaises qui respectaient ou d\u00e9passaient les normes ergonomiques de l'\u00e9poque. Elles avaient toutes un dossier ajustable, des si\u00e8ges dont la hauteur \u00e9tait ajustable et des accoudoirs ajustables.\n[120] La chaise personnelle de M. Smith \u00e9tait faite d'une seule pi\u00e8ce, le dossier, les accoudoirs et le si\u00e8ge n'\u00e9taient pas ajustables. La seule modification que M. Smith y avait apport\u00e9e \u00e9tait l'ajout d'un coussin Obusforme pour son dos. Sa chaise ne respectait aucune des normes ergonomiques recommand\u00e9es.\na) Journaux de M. Smith [121] Une importante partie du PRT \u00e9tait le fait que M. Smith devait tenir un journal quotidien dans lequel il devait inscrire les t\u00e2ches qu'il avait effectu\u00e9es et tous les sympt\u00f4mes qu'il avait ressentis avant, pendant et apr\u00e8s chaque t\u00e2che. Il devait aviser Mme Gordon (elle lui avait donn\u00e9 son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et de t\u00e9l\u00e9avertisseur) s'il avait des difficult\u00e9s avec les t\u00e2ches pour qu'elle puisse modifier le plan.\n[122] M. Smith a inscrit dans son journal que, d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e, il a ressenti de la douleur et des spasmes dans le dos au cours de la journ\u00e9e. Il r\u00e9agissait \u00e0 ces douleurs en marchant, en prenant des m\u00e9dicaments, ou en se couchant dans la salle de r\u00e9union. Parfois, il retournait \u00e0 son h\u00f4tel et se couchait sur un coussin chauffant qui diminuait ses spasmes.\n[123] \u00c0 mesure que sa formation a avanc\u00e9, il a \u00e9crit que ses spasmes et ses douleurs au dos ont augment\u00e9. \u00c0 la troisi\u00e8me semaine, il a indiqu\u00e9 que sa jambe gauche lui faisait mal, qu'elle devenait engourdie et que sa d\u00e9marche en \u00e9tait visiblement affect\u00e9e. Parfois, il devait quitter la formation plus t\u00f4t que pr\u00e9vu et retourner \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel afin de pouvoir s'\u00e9tendre sur son coussin chauffant.\n[124] Bien qu'on lui ait demand\u00e9, M. Smith a fourni tr\u00e8s peu de d\u00e9tails au sujet de ses t\u00e2ches quotidiennes. En fait, il a surtout \u00e9crit \u00e0 propos de son niveau de confort, des difficult\u00e9s physiques auxquelles il faisait face et de ce qu'il faisait pour soulager la douleur et les spasmes qu'il ressentait.\n[125] M. Smith croyait que l'objectif des journaux \u00e9tait d'aviser Mme Gordon et l'\u00e9quipe du PRT des t\u00e2ches qui aggravaient son \u00e9tat physique. \u00c0 son avis, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de fournir plus de d\u00e9tails puisque Mme Gordon connaissait ses t\u00e2ches. Elle pouvait examiner les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de son superviseur et les rapports hebdomadaires sur son progr\u00e8s, dont ils discutaient lors des r\u00e9unions hebdomadaires.\n[126] Les r\u00e9unions hebdomadaires entre Mme Gordon, M. Smith et son superviseur ou ses formateurs faisaient partie du PRT. Lors de la r\u00e9union du 13 juin 2003, ils ont discut\u00e9 de certains points et M. Smith a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre de questions. Il \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il r\u00e9ussissait bien sa formation. Il commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 comprendre le syst\u00e8me informatique et il croyait que les moments o\u00f9 il suivait des coordonnateurs de formation des trains au parc Thornton \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s utiles.\n[127] Cependant, il se sentait pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des journ\u00e9es de huit heures. Mme Gordon a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, pendant la deuxi\u00e8me semaine, il ne devait travailler pendant huit heures que le mardi et le jeudi, et que le reste de la semaine, il travaillerait pendant six heures, ce qu'il avait bien r\u00e9ussi pendant la premi\u00e8re semaine.\n[128] M. Smith a aussi mentionn\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de la fr\u00e9quence des spasmes qu'il ressentait au dos et des difficult\u00e9s que cela lui causait. Mme Gordon lui a dit que, s'il souffrait de spasmes ou qu'il avait simplement une mauvaise journ\u00e9e, il pouvait lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner et ils discuteraient des choix qui s'offraient \u00e0 lui, comme la possibilit\u00e9 d'aller s'entra\u00eener au centre de conditionnement physique, de se reposer en allant aux toilettes ou de prendre une pause et de se rendre \u00e0 son h\u00f4tel.\n[129] Mme Gordon lui a aussi expliqu\u00e9 que les t\u00e2ches de son poste respectaient ses restrictions. Il avait la possibilit\u00e9 de se lever, de marcher et de changer de position lorsqu'il en ressentait le besoin.\n[130] M. Smith a aussi avis\u00e9 Mme Gordon qu'il n'aimait pas le fait qu'il devait toujours manger dans un restaurant. Elle lui a fait remarquer que son h\u00f4tel offrait l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une cuisine et \u00e0 un r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur. M. Smith pouvait cuisiner ses propres repas, mais il a r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'aimait pas cuisiner pour une seule personne.\n[131] Lors de la r\u00e9union, M. Smith a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il n'aimait pas habiter dans un h\u00f4tel. Il avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 dormir. Mme Gordon lui a r\u00e9pondu que la CN ne transporterait pas son lit de Terrace \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[132] Mme Gordon \u00e9tait d'avis que les pr\u00e9occupations de M. Smith confirmaient la tendance qu'elle avait remarqu\u00e9e au cours de l'\u00e9laboration du PRT et au cours des deux premi\u00e8res semaines de formation : M. Smith cherchait, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, \u00e0 trouver des barri\u00e8res qui n'\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la composition du plan.\n[133] De plus, ses plaintes au sujet de ses spasmes dans le dos \u00e9taient particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9occupantes parce que les spasmes \u00e9taient plus fr\u00e9quents et duraient plus longtemps. Le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains est un poste essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et M. Smith devait \u00eatre disponible \u00e0 tout moment pendant son quart de travail. S'il quittait le bureau pour s'\u00e9tendre ou retourner \u00e0 son h\u00f4tel, il ne serait pas capable de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une urgence.\n(ii) Deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du PRT - Prince George - juillet 2003 [134] M. Smith a termin\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du PRT le 20 juin 2003, soit sa derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e au parc Thornton. Lors de la r\u00e9union hebdomadaire du 20 juin 2003, \u00e0 laquelle M. Smith et l'\u00e9quipe du PRT ont assist\u00e9, Bruce Feltham, le gestionnaire charg\u00e9 de la formation de M. Smith, a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il croyait que M. Smith avait acquis environ 75 p. 100 des comp\u00e9tences et des connaissances n\u00e9cessaires pour le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains. Il pouvait acqu\u00e9rir le reste lors de la formation pratique \u00e0 Prince George.\n[135] Dave Radford, le surintendant adjoint du Transport \u00e0 Prince George, \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement responsable de la coordination du programme de formation de M. Smith \u00e0 Prince George. Il devait organiser les quarts de formation de M. Smith et surveiller et g\u00e9rer son \u00e9volution par rapport au programme. Il a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 l'h\u00e9bergement pour M. Smith \u00e0 Prince George, a organis\u00e9 son transport \u00e0 partir de Terrace et pour y retourner, ainsi que son transport dans Prince George pour se rendre de l'h\u00f4tel au bureau du parc \u00e0 mat\u00e9riel remorqu\u00e9 et de retour du bureau \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel.\n[136] Le superviseur qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith devait garantir que ce dernier recevait la formation appropri\u00e9e. Les quarts de travail de M. Smith \u00e9taient organis\u00e9s afin qu'il puisse avoir une bonne vue d'ensemble de ce qui se passait dans la gare, y compris de l'importance du fait que le personnel \u00e0 la gare puisse communiquer avec le coordonnateur de formation des trains en tout temps.\n[137] La formation de M. Smith \u00e0 Prince George a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 2 juillet 2003. Avant le d\u00e9but de cette \u00e9tape, vers la fin juin, M. Radford a rencontr\u00e9 M. McDonald pour lui faire visiter la gare. La visite comprenait le bureau du parc, soit le lieu de travail du coordonnateur de formation des trains o\u00f9 M. Smith travaillerait. M. Radford a expliqu\u00e9 de quelle fa\u00e7on le bureau serait r\u00e9nov\u00e9 afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Smith. Il a aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la nature des activit\u00e9s dans le parc et les exigences du poste.\n[138] Les r\u00e9novations du bureau comprenaient l'ajout d'un poste de travail ajustable qui permettrait \u00e0 M. Smith de travailler tant en position assise qu'en position debout. On allait lui fournir une chaise ergonomique et le bureau allait \u00eatre \u00e9largi pour qu'il y ait suffisamment d'espace pour ces meubles.\n[139] M. Radford \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 faire les d\u00e9penses n\u00e9cessaires, mais compte tenu de l'\u00e9tendue des travaux n\u00e9cessaires, il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait attendre que M. Smith occupe le poste de fa\u00e7on permanente. Entre-temps, la CN a fait envoyer la chaise personnelle de M. Smith de Vancouver \u00e0 Prince George.\n[140] Mme Gordon a aussi expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith que lorsqu'il aurait termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s le PRT et qu'il serait confirm\u00e9 qu'il occuperait le poste de fa\u00e7on permanente, le mat\u00e9riel de bureau n\u00e9cessaire serait achet\u00e9 et le bureau serait r\u00e9nov\u00e9.\n[141] M. Smith devait travailler tant la semaine que la fin de semaine. Son horaire \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent d'une semaine \u00e0 l'autre pour lui permettre d'apprendre \u00e0 conna\u00eetre les diff\u00e9rents quarts de travail et leurs aspects distincts.\na) Journaux de M. Smith [142] Comme pour la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, M. Smith devait \u00e9crire dans un journal tous les jours. Il devrait y inscrire les t\u00e2ches qu'il avait accomplies, s'il avait eu des difficult\u00e9s et s'il avait ressenti des sympt\u00f4mes. Encore une fois, M. Smith a surtout mentionn\u00e9 le niveau de douleur et les sympt\u00f4mes qu'il ressentait. Il a rarement d\u00e9crit ses t\u00e2ches et n'a pas fait de lien entre ses sympt\u00f4mes et les t\u00e2ches.\n[143] De temps en temps, il utilisait les journaux pour exprimer son d\u00e9saccord avec Mme Gordon, par exemple en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ses restrictions de travail et \u00e0 son \u00e9tat indemnisable. Dans l'inscription qu'il a faite le 2 juillet, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Gordon de lui fournir une description d'emploi et des fonctions d'un coordonnateur de formation des trains, ainsi que le niveau de classification et la cotation num\u00e9rique.\n[144] Brad Butterwick, le superviseur de M. Smith, suivait les progr\u00e8s de M. Smith \u00e0 Prince George. Il a avis\u00e9 Tanya Gordon que du 2 au 5 juillet, M. Smith \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 au travail \u00e0 l'heure pr\u00e9vue. M. Butterwick a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas remarqu\u00e9 de probl\u00e8mes quant \u00e0 des douleurs et \u00e0 des spasmes dans le dos, \u00e0 part le fait que M. Smith s'appuyait sur son bureau.\n[145] La situation est rest\u00e9e la m\u00eame, sauf le 10 juillet. M. Butterwick a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait remarqu\u00e9 que M. Smith tremblait, qu'il suait et qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s p\u00e2le. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 en taxi \u00e0 l'urgence de l'h\u00f4pital local, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 et a re\u00e7u son cong\u00e9.\n[146] D'apr\u00e8s les journaux de M. Smith, dans la semaine du 2 juillet, il a quitt\u00e9 le bureau plus t\u00f4t dans l'un de ses cinq quarts de travail. Dans la semaine du 10 juillet, il a quitt\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t trois fois sur cinq, dans la semaine du 17 au 21 juillet, il a quitt\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t trois fois sur cinq, et dans la semaine du 25 juillet, il a quitt\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t dans l'un de ses quatre quarts de travail. Il a mentionn\u00e9 dans ses journaux que ces jours-l\u00e0, il avait ressenti des spasmes douloureux.\n[147] \u00c0 un certain moment pendant cette p\u00e9riode, Terry Petry, agent de la gestion des risques \u00e0 la CN et membre de l'\u00e9quipe du PRT, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith de donner plus de d\u00e9tails au sujet de ses t\u00e2ches dans ses journaux. M. Smith a r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait des t\u00e2ches de coordonnateur de formation des trains. S'il devait inscrire, \u00e0 la minute pr\u00e8s, chaque fois qu'il \u00e9tait assis, qu'il se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait ou qu'il allait aux toilettes, etc., il s'\u00e9loignerait de la raison principale pour laquelle il se trouvait \u00e0 Prince George.\n[148] M. Petry a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith s'il \u00e9tait r\u00e9solu \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Prince George. M. Smith a r\u00e9pondu qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 changer de domicile et \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager sa famille \u00e0 Prince George, mais qu'il le faisait par contrainte. Il disait \u00eatre contraint de le faire parce qu'il croyait que la CN n'avait pas fait tous les efforts n\u00e9cessaires pour lui trouver un poste \u00e0 Terrace, ou n'avait pas s\u00e9rieusement examin\u00e9 sa demande en ce sens.\n[149] Le 22 juillet 2003, le Dr Appleton a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. McDonald. M. Petry avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith une lettre de son m\u00e9decin qui expliquait ses spasmes. Dans la lettre, le Dr Appleton a \u00e9crit que M. Smith lui avait dit qu'il ressentait des spasmes dans le dos r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Pour soulager les spasmes, il prenait des m\u00e9dicaments, s'allongeait, s'\u00e9tirait et relaxait.\n[150] Il a aussi \u00e9crit que M. Smith lui avait dit que le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains exigeait qu'il soit assis jusqu'\u00e0 95 p. 100 du temps et qu'il n'avait pas souvent la possibilit\u00e9 de bouger, de marcher ou de s'\u00e9tirer. Il est vrai que, sur papier, l'analyse des exigences physiques et des conditions de travail pour le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains indiquait que l'employ\u00e9 restait assis 95 p. 100 du temps et \u00e9tait debout 5 p. 100 du temps.\n[151] Cependant, ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas pour M. Smith. Il pouvait s'asseoir, se tenir debout ou marcher selon ses besoins. En fait, dans deux ou trois entr\u00e9es dans ses journaux, il a \u00e9crit qu'il avait pu bouger, changer de position et se promener \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur.\n[152] M. McDonald a r\u00e9pondu au Dr Appleton le 10 septembre 2003. Il a avis\u00e9 le Dr Appleton qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal inform\u00e9 au sujet de l'exigence de rester assis 95 p. 100 du temps. Le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait convenable pour M. Smith. Il n'avait pas \u00e0 rester assis de fa\u00e7on prolong\u00e9e. En fait, compte tenu de son exp\u00e9rience comme conseiller en r\u00e9habilitation professionnelle, M. McDonald n'avait jamais vu un emploi qui offrait autant de souplesse au niveau des changements de positions, que ce soit dans le bureau ou \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur.\n[153] Mme Gordon commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 s'inqui\u00e9ter de l'augmentation de la fr\u00e9quence des spasmes, que M. Smith avait inscrite dans ses journaux, et de son besoin de s'\u00e9tendre parfois pendant une heure ou plus. Elle \u00e9tait aussi pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le nombre de fois o\u00f9 M. Smith quittait le bureau \u00e0 l'avance.\n[154] Elle a dit \u00e0 M. Smith que ses journaux ne comprenaient pas les renseignements requis. Plut\u00f4t que de d\u00e9crire les t\u00e2ches qu'il faisait, il discutait plut\u00f4t de ses niveaux de douleur, de son inconfort et de ce qu'il faisait pour r\u00e9gler cet inconfort. Elle lui a rappel\u00e9 que les journaux servaient \u00e0 suivre ses activit\u00e9s quotidiennes et \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer quelles activit\u00e9s lui causaient des probl\u00e8mes.\n[155] Finalement, le 29 juillet 2003, Dave Radford a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Smith pour l'aviser que, bien que la CN croyait qu'il \u00e9tait capable d'effectuer le travail d'un coordonnateur de formation des trains sans formation suppl\u00e9mentaire, il n'avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 d'engagement envers son emploi. Il avait refus\u00e9 de suivre les directives au sujet de ses inscriptions dans son journal. Il avait tendance \u00e0 quitter son lieu de travail ou \u00e0 ne pas s'occuper de son travail pour plut\u00f4t consacrer son temps \u00e0 des questions qui n'\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9es au travail, de fa\u00e7on de plus en plus fr\u00e9quente et longue \u00e0 mesure que le plan avan\u00e7ait. En raison de ces probl\u00e8mes, en plus des observations objectives de ses superviseurs \u00e0 Prince George, la CN a annul\u00e9 le PRT. M. Smith est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 Terrace.\n[156] Le 5 ao\u00fbt 2003, Mme Gordon a \u00e9crit une longue lettre \u00e0 M. McDonald dans laquelle elle pr\u00e9cisait les raisons pour lesquelles la CN avait annul\u00e9 le PRT. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 le fait que M. Smith avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il poss\u00e9dait les aptitudes physiques et mentales n\u00e9cessaires pour le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains. Cependant, \u00e0 son avis, il avait constamment pos\u00e9 des obstacles \u00e0 son retour au travail qui ne faisaient pas partie des lignes directrices que la WCB avait envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 la CN au sujet de ses capacit\u00e9s physiques et de son \u00e9tat indemnisable.\n[157] Elle a mentionn\u00e9 la fr\u00e9quence des spasmes de M. Smith et l'exigence qu'il avait impos\u00e9e selon laquelle il devait s'allonger pendant qu'il travaillait. Mme Gordon a not\u00e9 que le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains permettait une grande souplesse pour qu'il puisse prendre des pauses, s'\u00e9tirer, faire de courtes promenades et s'allonger pendant de courtes p\u00e9riodes. Lorsqu'il travaillait \u00e0 son bureau, M. Smith pouvait travailler debout ou assis. Il pouvait aussi marcher \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur lorsqu'il n'avait pas de t\u00e2ches de bureau, s'il apportait une radio portative ou un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire.\n[158] Mme Gordon a aussi mentionn\u00e9 le fait que, de temps \u00e0 autres, M. Smith \u00e9tait incapable de terminer son quart de travail. La fr\u00e9quence de ses d\u00e9parts h\u00e2tifs et le temps qu'il passait allong\u00e9 sur le sol avaient un effet n\u00e9gatif sur sa formation sur les lieux du travail. Le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains est un poste essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui exige qu'il soit capable de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une situation d'urgence. Le fait que M. Smith avait besoin de quitter le bureau ou de s'allonger sur le sol pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes l'emp\u00eachait de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des urgences.\n[159] En ce qui a trait au niveau d'engagement de M. Smith envers son PRT \u00e0 Prince George, ses superviseurs ont remarqu\u00e9 qu'il avait peu d'int\u00e9r\u00eat et d'engagement envers le plan. Cela se refl\u00e9tait aussi dans son d\u00e9faut ou son refus d'inscrire plus de d\u00e9tails dans son journal.\n[160] Mme Gordon a conclu que si ces probl\u00e8mes pouvaient \u00eatre r\u00e9solus, la CN \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 poursuivre le PRT, qui serait suivi d'un poste permanent \u00e0 titre de coordonnateur de formation des trains.\n[161] Dans une lettre qu'il a \u00e9crite le 17 septembre 2003 \u00e0 M. McDonald, M. Smith a longuement r\u00e9pondu aux points que Mme Gordon avait soulev\u00e9s. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas choisi son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Il ressentait des spasmes musculaires et des douleurs et il ne pouvait r\u00e9gler la situation qu'en prenant des m\u00e9dicaments, en appliquant de la chaleur sur son dos et en s'allongeant.\n[162] En ce qui a trait aux journaux, M. Smith a r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait bien mentionn\u00e9 les t\u00e2ches qu'il avait effectu\u00e9es, les probl\u00e8mes qu'il avait au sujet du poste de travail et la conduite dans le parc, et les niveaux de douleurs qu'il avait ressenties. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'on ne lui avait jamais donn\u00e9 de r\u00e9troaction ou de r\u00e9ponse au sujet des probl\u00e8mes qu'il avait mentionn\u00e9s.\n[163] Plus t\u00f4t, le 18 ao\u00fbt 2003, M. Smith avait \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. McDonald pour lui affirmer son engagement \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager. Il a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait particip\u00e9 au programme de formation de six semaines \u00e0 Vancouver et \u00e0 Prince George. Il avait fait peinturer l'ext\u00e9rieur de sa maison \u00e0 Terrace et sa femme et lui avaient fait le tour de Prince George pour regarder des maisons. Bien qu'ils ne voulaient pas d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, M. Smith \u00e9tait d'avis que ces actions d\u00e9montraient sa d\u00e9termination et son engagement \u00e0 retourner au travail.\nI. Grief du syndicat d\u00e9pos\u00e9 pour M. Smith, juin 2002 [164] Il convient de noter que pendant que M. Smith disait \u00e0 la CN qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Prince George, sous la contrainte, il a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son syndicat de d\u00e9poser un grief en son nom d\u00e8s le 11 juin 2001. Le syndicat l'a fait le 26 juin 2002. Dans son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des questions en litige, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le 9 juillet 2003, le syndicat soutenait que des mesures d'accommodement devaient \u00eatre prises pour M. Smith dans la gare de Terrace, o\u00f9 il habitait. Le d\u00e9faut de la CN de le faire constituait une violation de la convention collective et de l'obligation de la CN, en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP), de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour M. Smith.\n[165] Le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9. L'arbitre devait trancher la question de savoir si la CN s'\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation, pr\u00e9vue par la LCDP, de prendre des mesures raisonnables d'accommodement envers l'invalidit\u00e9 de M. Smith.\n[166] Dans son jugement rendu le 14 juillet 2003, l'arbitre Pich\u00e9 a accept\u00e9 le point de vue de la CN selon lequel il n'y avait pas de travail qui convenait \u00e0 M. Smith \u00e0 Terrace. L'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement, si cela n'impose pas une contrainte excessive, n'oblige pas la CN \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un poste qui n'a aucune valeur pour la compagnie.\n[167] L'arbitre Pich\u00e9 a conclu que la CN avait pris des mesures raisonnables d'accommodement lorsqu'elle a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer M. Smith dans le poste qu'il occupait avant de se blesser, puis lorsqu'elle a offert \u00e0 M. Smith le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains.\n[168] En ce qui a trait aux difficult\u00e9s caus\u00e9es par le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de M. Smith et de sa famille \u00e0 Prince George, l'arbitre a conclu que l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement ne tenait pas la CN responsable de tous les aspects \u00e9conomiques et familiaux de la vie de M. Smith. L'obligation de la CN se limite \u00e0 l'accommodement en mati\u00e8re d'emploi et de lieux de travail.\n[169] Le 1er octobre 2003, M. McDonald a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Smith pour l'aviser que la WCB ne lui verserait plus de prestations de r\u00e9habilitation professionnelle. Cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le fait que le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains convenait \u00e0 son retour au travail, compte tenu de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et de ses restrictions de travail. \u00c0 son avis, le PRT n'avait pas connu de succ\u00e8s en raison des obstacles que M. Smith avait plac\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, la WCB ne participerait plus \u00e0 un programme de retour au travail pour M. Smith et M. Smith n'aurait pas le droit de r\u00e9clamer des pertes de revenus pr\u00e9vues.\n[170] M. Smith a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la section de r\u00e9vision de la WCB de r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision de M. McDonald du 1er octobre 2003. L'agent de r\u00e9vision a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision le 12 juillet 2004.\n[171] Le 9 ao\u00fbt 2004, un agent de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de la WCB a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Smith pour l'aviser que le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e9tait un poste appropri\u00e9 qui respectait ses restrictions de travail.\n[172] M. Smith a demand\u00e9 une r\u00e9vision de cette d\u00e9cision. Dans sa d\u00e9cision du 31 mars 2005, l'agent de r\u00e9vision a conclu que le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains constituait un accommodement appropri\u00e9 pour M. Smith. La r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9tait comparable \u00e0 celle qu'il avait avant de se blesser. Il \u00e9tait raisonnable que M. Smith ait \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager pour occuper ce poste. M. Smith a port\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision en appel aupr\u00e8s du Worker's Compensation Appeal Tribunal.\nJ. Cinqui\u00e8me PRT - Coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains - Janvier 2004 [173] La saga des mesures d'accommodement ne s'est cependant pas termin\u00e9e le 29 juillet 2003. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre, Rob Reny de la CN et Dave Brummund du syndicat ont discut\u00e9 et ont communiqu\u00e9 par \u00e9crit. M. Brummund a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Reny si la CN pouvait r\u00e9tablir le PRT pour le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George. Le syndicat \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Smith \u00e9tait capable d'occuper ce poste.\n[174] Le CN a accept\u00e9 de le faire, mais elle a affect\u00e9 M. Smith au poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains. On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Gordon de pr\u00e9parer un PRT modifi\u00e9. Il devait d\u00e9buter le 12 janvier 2004 et devait se terminer le 30 janvier 2004. Le poste \u00e9tait con\u00e7u express\u00e9ment pour M. Smith, en fonction de ses restrictions de travail. La CN paierait son salaire, ses frais de transport de Terrace \u00e0 Prince George, et de retour \u00e0 Terrace, son h\u00e9bergement, son transport au travail et de retour \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel et une indemnit\u00e9 quotidienne pour ses d\u00e9penses.\n[175] La CN a aussi accept\u00e9 que, lorsque M. Smith aurait termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s sa formation, elle lui donnerait un poste de travail et une chaise ergonomique, elle installerait du plancher plus souple dans le bureau et elle r\u00e9noverait le bureau de la gare pour que cet \u00e9quipement puisse \u00eatre install\u00e9.\n[176] Comme pour le plan pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, M. Smith devait tenir des journaux dans lesquels il devait inscrire les t\u00e2ches qu'il accomplissait, ses niveaux de confort et les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles il faisait face, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n(i) T\u00e2ches de M. Smith et responsabilit\u00e9s du coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains [177] M. Smith devait aider le coordonnateur de formation des trains en fonction. Il n'avait pas la responsabilit\u00e9 principale du poste. M. Smith avait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la salle des premiers soins et il pouvait quitter le bureau du coordonnateur de formation des trains lorsqu'il avait besoin de s'allonger et de s'occuper de ses maux de dos.\n[178] Le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains n'est pas un poste essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Cela offrait \u00e0 M. Smith plus de possibilit\u00e9s de se lever, de s'allonger et de marcher que le poste de coordonnateur.\n[179] \u00c0 la demande de M. Smith, la CN a fait venir sa chaise personnelle de Terrace \u00e0 Prince George.\n[180] M. Smith n'a pas termin\u00e9 ce PRT. Selon son journal, il a travaill\u00e9 du 12 janvier au 27 janvier 2004. Il a \u00e9crit qu'il avait beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s avec cette tentative de retour au travail. Ses inscriptions dans son journal sont d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, mais portent sur les probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux qu'il avait et ne mentionnent pas les t\u00e2ches qu'il effectuait.\n[181] Bien que Mme Gordon et d'autres membres de l'\u00e9quipe de transition aient plusieurs fois rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith l'importance des renseignements dans les journaux, M. Smith a reconnu qu'il y avait \u00e9crit peu de choses au sujet des t\u00e2ches qu'il accomplissait.\n[182] M. Smith a confirm\u00e9 que, comme coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains, il pouvait se lever, bouger ou quitter le bureau pour aller s'allonger parce que le coordonnateur de formation des trains pouvait couvrir son poste pendant ce temps. Il a aussi reconnu que le poste de coordonnateur adjoint \u00e9tait moins exigeant que le poste de coordonnateur.\n[183] M. Smith a confirm\u00e9 que, pendant qu'il travaillait comme coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains, on ne lui avait pas demand\u00e9 de faire quoi que ce soit qui d\u00e9passait ses restrictions de travail.\n(ii) Annulation du PRT au poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains [184] M. Radford a remarqu\u00e9 qu'au d\u00e9but, M. Smith r\u00e9ussissait tr\u00e8s bien. Cependant, plus le temps avan\u00e7ait, plus les heures que M. Smith passait \u00e0 travailler pendant son quart diminuaient. M. Radford craignait que cela interrompe le cycle de formation. M. Smith devait \u00eatre form\u00e9 selon un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pr\u00e9cis et il prenait du retard sur le calendrier.\n[185] Le 29 janvier 2004, M. Smith a laiss\u00e9 un message sur la bo\u00eete vocale du bureau de M. Radford pour lui demander s'ils pouvaient se rencontrer le plus t\u00f4t possible dans un restaurant \u00e0 Prince George. M. Radford s'y est rendu en voiture et a vu M. Smith, qui semblait souffrir de douleurs. Ce dernier a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Radford de l'accompagner jusqu'\u00e0 son h\u00f4tel.\n[186] M. Smith a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Radford qu'il ressentait des douleurs importantes. \u00c0 ce moment, M. Radford a conclu qu'il fallait mettre fin au PRT. La meilleure fa\u00e7on d'aider M. Smith \u00e9tait de lui permettre de retourner \u00e0 Terrace o\u00f9 il pourrait \u00eatre avec sa femme et son m\u00e9decin, et o\u00f9 il pourrait r\u00e9gler ses probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux.\nK. Autre possibilit\u00e9 d'occuper le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains [187] Le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2004, apr\u00e8s l'annulation du PRT, M. Brummund a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Reny pour lui demander de donner une autre chance \u00e0 M. Smith d'occuper le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la CN de fournir \u00e0 M. Smith une chaise ergonomique et un poste de travail ajustable, et de faire v\u00e9rifier le milieu de travail par un ergoth\u00e9rapeute, qui pourrait sugg\u00e9rer des modifications.\n[188] Le 29 juin 2004, M. Reny a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Brummund que la CN donnerait une derni\u00e8re chance \u00e0 M. Smith de reprendre le travail comme coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George. Cependant, M. Smith devait s'engager envers la CN, par \u00e9crit, \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter le plan et \u00e0 fournir des journaux dans lesquels les entr\u00e9es quotidiennes \u00e9taient d\u00e9taill\u00e9es.\n[189] M. Reny \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que le retour au travail de M. Smith avait connu si peu de succ\u00e8s. Dans ses communications avec M. Brummund, il voulait qu'il soit tr\u00e8s clair que la CN s'attendait \u00e0 ce que M. Smith participe activement et qu'il coop\u00e8re avec toute future tentative de retour au travail. La CN n'\u00e9tait toujours pas certaine si M. Smith \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager.\n[190] La CN allait entreprendre les r\u00e9novations n\u00e9cessaires et l'achat d'\u00e9quipement d\u00e8s que le PRT aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s. La CN offrirait aussi la m\u00eame souplesse qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte dans les programmes de retour au travail pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, ce qui permettrait \u00e0 M. Smith de changer de position selon ses besoins. De plus, il pourrait s'allonger dans la salle de premiers soins si c'\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire.\n[191] M. Brummund a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Reny le 13 ao\u00fbt 2004. Le syndicat demandait une d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9cise du mot [traduction] engagement et une explication sur la fa\u00e7on dont la CN s'attendait \u00e0 ce que M. Smith [traduction] compl\u00e8te le plan.\n[192] Quant aux journaux, le syndicat \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Smith avait rempli les journaux comme on lui avait demand\u00e9, mais que la CN n'avait fait aucun ajustement par rapport \u00e0 ses probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux.\n[193] M. Reny a r\u00e9\u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Brummund le 20 ao\u00fbt 2004. Il a confirm\u00e9 que la CN apporterait les modifications requises d\u00e8s que M. Smith avait termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s le programme de retour au travail. Il a not\u00e9 les conclusions de la WCB et des Services de sant\u00e9 au travail de la CN selon lesquelles ces modifications n'\u00e9taient pas essentielles \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite de la formation de M. Smith. La CN demandait seulement que M. Smith suive un programme de base de trois semaines afin qu'elle puisse d\u00e9terminer s'il \u00e9tait capable de travailler dans cet environnement.\n[194] De fa\u00e7on plus importante, la CN offrait \u00e0 M. Smith le poste permanent de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George, qui entrerait en vigueur imm\u00e9diatement. Cependant, M. Smith devait coop\u00e9rer en ce qui a trait aux inscriptions dans les journaux de ses t\u00e2ches quotidiennes \u00e0 titre de coordonnateur adjoint, afin que les modifications n\u00e9cessaires puissent \u00eatre apport\u00e9es \u00e0 son emploi ou \u00e0 son lieu de travail. La CN offrait aussi de rembourser les frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de M. Smith \u00e0 Prince George. M. Reny a demand\u00e9 l'accord du syndicat et de M. Smith.\n[195] Le 1er septembre 2004, M. Smith a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Brummund en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre de M. Reny. Il a soutenu qu'il n'y avait rien de nouveau dans la proposition. \u00c0 son avis, la CN n'offrait aucune nouvelle solution, modification ou voie de recours.\n[196] Le 12 octobre 2004, M. Reny a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Brummund dans lequel il pr\u00e9cisait que l'objectif de la CN avait \u00e9t\u00e9, et \u00e9tait toujours, d'offrir \u00e0 M. Smith un emploi permanent \u00e0 long terme. Rien n'avait chang\u00e9 dans l'exploitation \u00e0 Terrace qui permettrait \u00e0 M. Smith d'y obtenir un tel emploi. Il a demand\u00e9 au syndicat de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la proposition du CN du 20 ao\u00fbt 2004.\n[197] M. Reny a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Brummund le 11 janvier 2005, dans lequel il demandait une r\u00e9ponse du syndicat. Dans son courriel du 18 janvier 2005 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brummund, M. Reny a mentionn\u00e9 que la CN avait modifi\u00e9 son offre en r\u00e9ponse aux demandes pr\u00e9cises du syndicat. Il a de nouveau demand\u00e9 l'opinion du syndicat.\n[198] M. Reny a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 sa demande dans les courriels qu'il a envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Shewchuck le 14 juin 2005, le 15 ao\u00fbt 2005 et le 7 septembre 2005.\n[199] Malgr\u00e9 les nombreuses tentatives de M. Reny d'obtenir l'opinion du syndicat au sujet de l'offre du 20 ao\u00fbt 2004, le syndicat n'a jamais officiellement r\u00e9pondu.\nL. Demande de pension d'invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Smith [200] Le 17 f\u00e9vrier 2002, M. Smith a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (RPC). Selon les crit\u00e8res d'admissibilit\u00e9, le demandeur doit souffrir d'une invalidit\u00e9 qui l'emp\u00eache de travailler de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, \u00e0 temps plein, \u00e0 temps partiel ou de fa\u00e7on saisonni\u00e8re. L'invalidit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre \u00e0 long terme et d'une dur\u00e9e inconnue.\n[201] La demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de M. Smith a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. L'expert en invalidit\u00e9 a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 12 avril 2002, dans laquelle il concluait que, dans le dossier qu'on lui avait remis, les rapports m\u00e9dicaux indiquaient que, bien que M. Smith ne pouvait pas occuper un emploi qui exigeait qu'il reste assis ou debout de fa\u00e7on prolong\u00e9e, il \u00e9tait tout de m\u00eame capable d'effectuer certains types de t\u00e2ches.\n[202] M. Smith a demand\u00e9 un r\u00e9examen de cette d\u00e9cision. Sa demande de r\u00e9examen a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e le 29 ao\u00fbt 2002, parce qu'il ne satisfaisait pas au crit\u00e8re d'invalidit\u00e9.\n[203] M. Smith a alors port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision en appel devant le tribunal de r\u00e9vision du RPC, qui a entendu l'appel le 10 mars 2004. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Smith a soutenu qu'il \u00e9tait absolument incapable de travailler depuis f\u00e9vrier 2002. Sa femme et lui ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations verbales au tribunal \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[204] M. Smith a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une lettre du Dr Appleton, dat\u00e9e du 3 mars 2004. Dans sa lettre, le Dr Appleton a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et les restrictions de travail de M. Smith et a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Smith \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement invalide et ne pouvait pas conserver d'emploi valable.\n[205] M. Smith a incit\u00e9 le Dr Appleton \u00e0 \u00e9crire cette lettre. Dans ses notes cliniques du 3 mars 2004, le Dr Appleton a not\u00e9 qu'il avait rencontr\u00e9 M. Smith et que ce dernier lui avait dit qu'il portait en appel une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9favorable au sujet des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. L'audience aurait lieu le 10 mars et M. Smith avait besoin d'une lettre d'appui.\n[206] Cette lettre du Dr Appleton contredisait l'opinion qu'il avait exprim\u00e9e dans sa lettre du 28 mars 2002, dans laquelle le Dr Appleton s'adressait \u00e0 qui de droit. Il y avait d\u00e9crit l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de M. Smith, son op\u00e9ration au dos et ses restrictions de travail. Le Dr Appleton avait poursuivi en pr\u00e9cisant que, malgr\u00e9 ces restrictions, M. Smith aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de retourner au travail le 10 juin 2001. Le Dr Appleton avait \u00e9crit cette lettre en lien avec la demande d'assurance-emploi de M. Smith.\n[207] Le tribunal de r\u00e9vision a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 28 avril 2004. Il a conclu que les invalidit\u00e9s de M. Smith l'emp\u00eachaient d'avoir un travail r\u00e9gulier et r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur depuis f\u00e9vrier 2002, date \u00e0 laquelle il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Le tribunal a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith une pension d'invalidit\u00e9 r\u00e9troactive \u00e0 juin 2002.\n[208] Dans sa demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC, M. Smith a accept\u00e9 d'aviser le RPC de tout changement \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 ou de tout retour au travail (\u00e0 temps plein, \u00e0 temps partiel, en b\u00e9n\u00e9volat, en p\u00e9riode d'essai ou en r\u00e9adaptation). Il ne l'a pas fait.\n[209] M. Smith n'a pas avis\u00e9 le RPC de ses deux PRT de juin 2003 et de janvier 2004, pendant lesquels il a re\u00e7u son plein salaire. Il n'a pas avis\u00e9 le RPC de l'\u00e9valuation de ses capacit\u00e9s fonctionnelles qu'il a subie en novembre 2002, dans laquelle il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que ses capacit\u00e9s physiques et fonctionnelles lui permettaient de travailler.\n[210] M. Smith n'a pas avis\u00e9 la CN, son syndicat, ni la WCB qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC en f\u00e9vrier 2002. Il ne leur a pas parl\u00e9 de la lettre du Dr Appleton, \u00e9crite le 4 mars 2004, dans laquelle le docteur pr\u00e9cisait que M. Smith \u00e9tait invalide et ne pouvait plus occuper d'emploi valable.\n[211] M. Smith n'a pas mentionn\u00e9, dans sa demande au RPC, devant le tribunal de r\u00e9vision du RPC, ni par la suite, qu'il \u00e9tait l'un des membres fondateurs de la Northwest Injured Workers Association (NIWA), qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2002. L'un des principaux objectifs de cette organisation \u00e9tait de fournir des conseils et du soutien aux travailleurs accident\u00e9s qui participent au processus de la WCB.\n[212] M. Smith est un b\u00e9n\u00e9vole tr\u00e8s actif au sein de la NIWA. Il a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans la constitution de la NIWA en soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il a organis\u00e9 un certain nombre de rassemblements et de r\u00e9unions \u00e0 Terrace et \u00e0 d'autres endroits de la r\u00e9gion, au cours desquels il a aussi agi \u00e0 titre de conf\u00e9rencier. Il a beaucoup particip\u00e9 aux activit\u00e9s de financement pour la NIWA afin de couvrir les co\u00fbts des activit\u00e9s et de payer les salaires des postes r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s. M. Smith esp\u00e9rait que, si ses efforts en mati\u00e8re de campagnes de financement \u00e9taient couronn\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s, on lui offrirait un des postes r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[213] M. Smith a postul\u00e9 \u00e0 l'automne 2002 ou 2003 pour le poste de conseiller des travailleurs aupr\u00e8s du ministre du Travail. S'il obtenait le poste, il devait aider les demandeurs de prestations de la WCB en les guidant \u00e0 travers le processus de la WCB.\nM. M. Smith peut-il travailler, ou est-il invalide de fa\u00e7on permanente? Faits dont il faut tenir compte (i) Lettre du 21 septembre 2004 [214] En septembre 2004, le Dr Appleton a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 qui de droit. Dans sa lettre, le Dr Appleton donnait son opinion quant \u00e0 l'offre la plus r\u00e9cente de la CN, telle qu'elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9crite dans la lettre que M. Reny avait \u00e9crite le 20 ao\u00fbt 2004. Le Dr Appleton \u00e9tait d'avis que la situation de travail n'\u00e9tait pas diff\u00e9rente de la formation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente que M. Smith avait essay\u00e9e, soit celle de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains.\n[215] M. Smith a convenu que l'avis du Dr Appleton au sujet du poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur ce que lui-m\u00eame lui avait dit. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait demand\u00e9 cette lettre au Dr Appleton et qu'il voulait l'avis du docteur quant \u00e0 savoir s'il \u00e9tait capable d'effectuer les t\u00e2ches d'un coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains. Les motifs de M. Smith \u00e0 ce sujet ne sont pas clairs. Il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu l'avis du Dr Appleton le 3 mars 2004, qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au tribunal de r\u00e9vision du RPC, lequel avis disait que M. Smith \u00e9tait incapable de travailler.\n(ii) Demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre [216] Le syndicat a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre, demande qui a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e. L'avocat du syndicat, Clayton Cook, en avait discut\u00e9 avec M. Smith et lui avait expliqu\u00e9 que les chances de succ\u00e8s \u00e9taient faibles.\n[217] Dans un long message qu'il a envoy\u00e9 par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur \u00e0 M. Cook le 20 juin 2004, M. Smith contestait cette conclusion. Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail les faits de sa situation, M. Smith a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 son opinion que le syndicat avait d\u00e9fendue lors de l'arbitrage : la CN avait l'obligation de lui trouver un poste \u00e0 la gare o\u00f9 il travaillait avant de chercher \u00e0 lui trouver un poste ailleurs. Il n'acceptait pas la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre selon laquelle la CN avait fait des efforts raisonnables en vue de respecter cette obligation.\n[218] M. Smith voulait que le contr\u00f4le judiciaire se poursuive. Il \u00e9tait soutenu qu'il \u00e9tait capable de travailler \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, certainement \u00e0 Terrace. Cependant, dans ses discussions avec M. Cook et dans les t\u00e9l\u00e9copies qu'il lui a envoy\u00e9es, M. Smith ne lui a jamais dit qu'il recevait des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC.\n(iii) La d\u00e9cision du WCAT - F\u00e9vrier 2006 [219] Comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, M. Smith a port\u00e9 un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions de la WCB en appel au Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT), y compris la d\u00e9cision du 31 mars 2005 dans laquelle un agent de r\u00e9vision a refus\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 permanente. L'appel a eu lieu le 29 novembre 2005. M. Smith \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat.\n[220] Dans la d\u00e9cision qu'il a rendue le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2006, le WCAT a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l'agent de r\u00e9vision selon laquelle M. Smith n'avait pas droit \u00e0 des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 permanente fond\u00e9es sur la perte de salaire pr\u00e9vue. Le WCAT a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur les motifs suivants :\nla preuve m\u00e9dicale d\u00e9montre que l'emploi id\u00e9al pour M. Smith lui permettrait de s'asseoir, de se tenir debout et de marcher lorsqu'il en ressent le besoin;\nle poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains respecte ses restrictions de travail et offre \u00e0 M. Smith une possibilit\u00e9 d'emploi id\u00e9al ainsi qu'une grande souplesse lui permettant de traiter ses spasmes au dos lorsqu'il en ressent;\nM. Smith est capable d'occuper le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains;\nl'argument de M. Smith selon lequel la WCB et la CN ont l'obligation de chercher un poste pour lui \u00e0 Terrace avant de chercher ailleurs est rejet\u00e9. Si la CN pouvait trouver un emploi appropri\u00e9 ailleurs, il est tout \u00e0 fait illogique qu'elle cherche un emploi au salaire minimum \u00e0 Terrace et qu'elle paie des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 permanente pour couvrir la diff\u00e9rence du salaire perdu;\nM. Smith n'a pas d'attaches permanentes \u00e0 Terrace. Il y a habit\u00e9 pendant 16 ans, mais il a habit\u00e9 \u00e0 Prince George auparavant, pendant huit ans. Sa femme a un emploi \u00e0 temps partiel et travaille en de\u00e7\u00e0 de ses qualifications \u00e0 titre de pharmacienne. Ses enfants ont quitt\u00e9 la maison. Dans l'ensemble, les attaches de M. Smith \u00e0 Terrace ne sont pas solides et sa pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers Terrace ne justifie pas qu'il obtienne des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 permanente;\nla CN a agi de bonne foi en offrant \u00e0 M. Smith deux possibilit\u00e9s de formation \u00e0 Prince George et en lui offrant ensuite le poste permanent. M. Smith n'a pas agi de bonne foi parce qu'il n'a pas saisi l'offre;\nles difficult\u00e9s auxquelles il a fait face pendant sa formation \u00e9taient caus\u00e9es, en majeure partie, par lui-m\u00eame. L'intensit\u00e9 de ses spasmes au dos, le niveau auquel certaines activit\u00e9s causent ces spasmes, le niveau d'invalidit\u00e9 qu'ils causent et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour M. Smith de s'allonger afin de les traiter ne sont prouv\u00e9s que par les rapports de M. Smith. Ils ne sont pas v\u00e9rifiables de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante;\nM. Smith a refus\u00e9 un emploi qui \u00e9tait convenable, disponible et qui lui assurait un salaire \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 celui qu'il recevait avant de se blesser.\n(iv) Notes cliniques de 2006 du Dr Appleton [221] Le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2006, M. Smith a rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Appleton. Dans ses notes cliniques, le Dr Appleton a not\u00e9 que M. Smith demandait l'arbitrage \u00e0 la Commission des droits de la personne au sujet de ses maux de dos et de [traduction] l'incapacit\u00e9 de la CN de lui offrir un emploi de substitution. Le Dr Appleton \u00e9tait d'avis que la CN avait offert \u00e0 M. Smith un emploi de substitution qui aurait pu lui convenir, \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de Terrace, mais M. Smith a refus\u00e9 d'y aller.\n[222] Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9crit les sympt\u00f4mes de M. Smith et ses activit\u00e9s actuelles, le Dr Appleton a \u00e9crit que M. Smith avait un historique de probl\u00e8mes au niveau des disques lombaires et que ce probl\u00e8me continu \u00e9tait aggrav\u00e9 lorsque M. Smith devait rester assis ou debout pendant des p\u00e9riodes prolong\u00e9es. Cependant, son analyse des spasmes au dos ne correspond pas \u00e0 celle de M. Smith. Le Dr Appleton croyait fermement qu'il y avait une composante largement reli\u00e9e aux \u00e9motions dans ce cas. Il a soutenu par contre qu'il ne croyait pas que M. Smith simulait la douleur.\n[223] Le Dr Appleton a conclu ses notes en expliquant qu'il avait dit \u00e0 M. Smith, de fa\u00e7on non \u00e9quivoque, qu'il ne trouvait aucune source physiologique aux spasmes et qu'il ne serait pas en mesure de corroborer une raison physique pour ces maux si on lui demandait.\n[224] M. Smith a de nouveau rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Appleton le 24 mai 2006, quelques jours avant le d\u00e9but de l'audition de sa plainte devant le Tribunal. Dans ses notes cliniques, le Dr Appleton a not\u00e9 que M. Smith \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par les commentaires du Dr Appleton dans ses notes du 7 f\u00e9vrier 2006, selon lesquels il soutenait qu'on avait offert \u00e0 M. Smith un emploi de substitution \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de Terrace, qu'il avait refus\u00e9.\n[225] Le Dr Appleton a corrig\u00e9 ce point en notant que son commentaire portait sur une consultation ant\u00e9rieure au cours de laquelle M. Smith et lui avaient discut\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de travailler \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9gion, dans un poste qui respectait ses blessures. \u00c0 ce moment, M. Smith lui a dit qu'il serait difficile pour lui de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager en raison de l'emploi de sa femme. Le Dr Appleton a conclu qu'il ne savait pas si la CN pourrait offrir \u00e0 M. Smith un emploi convenable, compte tenu de ses blessures.\n(v) Recommandation au Dr Keyes, neurologue [226] M. Smith a demand\u00e9 au Dr Appleton de le renvoyer \u00e0 un autre sp\u00e9cialiste au sujet des spasmes qu'il ressentait au bas du dos. M. Smith avait trouv\u00e9 le nom du Dr Keyes, un neurologue. Bien que le Dr Appleton ne croyait pas que le Dr Keyes pourrait vraiment aider, il a fait la recommandation.\n[227] Le Dr Keyes a examin\u00e9 M. Smith le 1er novembre 2006. Apr\u00e8s son rendez-vous avec le Dr Keyes, M. Smith lui a \u00e9crit et lui a mentionn\u00e9 que la derni\u00e8re fois qu'il avait tent\u00e9 de retourner au travail, son employeur lui avait offert un emploi en informatique o\u00f9 il devait rester assis ou debout \u00e0 son poste de travail. Il avait de la difficult\u00e9 avec cet emploi en raison de ses douleurs et de ses spasmes musculaires.\n[228] La majeure partie du rapport du 9 novembre 2006 du Dr Keyes offrait un diagnostic m\u00e9dical d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et technique de l'\u00e9tat de M. Smith. Il a conclu que M. Smith souffrait d'un pincement discal important qui causait ses douleurs au bas du dos. Il n'a pas recommand\u00e9 une autre op\u00e9ration, mais a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les spasmes et les douleurs de M. Smith devaient \u00eatre trait\u00e9s avec des m\u00e9dicaments et de la physioth\u00e9rapie continue.\n(vi) Demande de M. Smith : prestations de retraite pour invalidit\u00e9 de la CN [229] Le 18 mai 2006, M. Smith a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations de retraite pour invalidit\u00e9 de la CN. Pour \u00eatre admissible, un employ\u00e9 doit \u00eatre compl\u00e8tement invalide, de fa\u00e7on permanente. Une invalidit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te et permanente est d\u00e9finie par la CN comme suit : [traduction] une invalidit\u00e9 physique ou mentale qui emp\u00eache une personne d'effectuer tout emploi qu'elle peut raisonnablement occuper en fonction de son \u00e9ducation, de sa formation et de son exp\u00e9rience, et dont il est raisonnable de croire qu'elle durera pour le reste de la vie de cette personne. C'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que M. Smith laissait entendre \u00e0 la CN qu'il souffrait d'une invalidit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te et permanente.\n[230] Dans la demande qu'il a remplie et sign\u00e9e, M. Smith a reconnu qu'il recevait des prestations du RPC. Il a aussi reconnu qu'il n'y a aucune possibilit\u00e9 de lui trouver des mesures d'accommodement en raison de son invalidit\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9gag\u00e9 la CN de toute responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement qu'elle puisse avoir envers lui.\n[231] Le Dr Appleton a rempli la section r\u00e9serv\u00e9e au m\u00e9decin traitant de la demande de M. Smith. Il a inscrit que M. Smith souffrait d'un rel\u00e2chement des disques lombaires et de douleurs lombaires de nature m\u00e9canique dans le bas du dos, qui existaient depuis des ann\u00e9es. Le Dr Appleton a mentionn\u00e9 les restrictions de travail de M. Smith, telles que pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es par la WCB : ne pas rester assis trop longtemps, ne pas trop se pencher, ne rien lever de lourd et changer de position fr\u00e9quemment.\n[232] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'invalidit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te et permanente de M. Smith, telle que d\u00e9crite dans le crit\u00e8re d'admissibilit\u00e9, le Dr Appleton a \u00e9crit qu'il n'y avait aucun emploi qui respectait ces restrictions.\n[233] La CN n'a pas accept\u00e9 la demande de M. Smith. Le Dr Lapierre, m\u00e9decin en chef de la CN, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Smith le 13 juin 2006 pour l'aviser qu'il ne satisfaisait pas au crit\u00e8re d'admissibilit\u00e9. D'apr\u00e8s les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux disponibles, rien n'indiquait que ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales l'emp\u00eachaient de travailler.\n[234] Pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, le Dr Lapierre a examin\u00e9 les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux dans le dossier de M. Smith du d\u00e9partement des Services de sant\u00e9 au travail de la CN et dans la d\u00e9cision du tribunal de r\u00e9vision du RPC. Le Dr Lapierre a tenu compte de la d\u00e9cision du WCAT du 10 f\u00e9vrier 2006 et, en particulier, des conclusions du WCAT selon lesquelles le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains est un emploi convenable que M. Smith peut occuper, il respecte ses restrictions de travail et le salaire de ce poste \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 celui que M. Smith gagnait avant de se blesser.\n[235] Il a aussi tenu compte de l'offre d'emploi que la CN a faite \u00e0 M. Smith le 20 ao\u00fbt 2004. Cette offre permettait d'\u00e9valuer la capacit\u00e9 de M. Smith \u00e0 travailler en comparant ses restrictions de travail avec les exigences du poste.\n[236] Compte tenu de ces renseignements, le Dr Lapierre a conclu que M. Smith n'\u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8tement invalide et qu'il ne satisfaisait donc pas aux crit\u00e8res d'admissibilit\u00e9 pour les prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de la CN.\n[237] Le Dr Lapierre a soutenu que la d\u00e9cision du tribunal de r\u00e9vision du RPC avait peu de valeur dans sa propre conclusion. La d\u00e9cision comprenait peu de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux sur lesquels il pouvait se fonder.\n[238] Le Dr Lapierre n'a pas discut\u00e9 avec les responsables de la CN au sujet de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne que M. Smith avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Il n'a pas du tout mentionn\u00e9 cette plainte dans sa d\u00e9cision de rejeter la demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de M. Smith.\n(vii) Demande de travail de M. Smith aupr\u00e8s de la CN, envoy\u00e9e par courriel le 29 juin 2006 [239] Le 29 juin 2006, M. Smith a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 David Trites, le coordonnateur de retour au travail de la CN qui avait remplac\u00e9 Tanya Gordon. Ce courriel a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 10 jours apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l'audience devant le Tribunal, le 19 juin 2006. Dans son courriel, M. Smith a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait heureux d'apprendre que M. Trites et Lynn Chorley (la chef d'\u00e9quipe des Services de sant\u00e9 au travail de la CN) lui cherchaient du travail qui correspondait \u00e0 ses capacit\u00e9s, puisque le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains ne lui convenait pas. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il serait tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par tout poste ou toute id\u00e9e qu'ils puissent avoir. Il a demand\u00e9 que M. Trites ou que le gestionnaire de Terrace lui fasse part de toutes leurs id\u00e9es.\n(viii) Proposition d'accommodement pour M. Smith - Septembre 2006 [240] Lorsqu'il a conclu son t\u00e9moignage en interrogation principal en septembre 2006, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Smith s'il accepterait un emploi convenable \u00e0 ce moment. Il a propos\u00e9 que la CN lui offre un poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains \u00e0 Terrace. Quant aux accommodements dont il aurait besoin pour effectuer son travail \u00e0 Terrace, M. Smith a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la liste suivante :\nune chaise convenable;\nun poste de travail dont la hauteur est ajustable;\nun endroit o\u00f9 il pourrait s'allonger, qui poss\u00e8de une prise de courant pour qu'il puisse y brancher son coussin chauffant;\nun tapis antifatigue sur le plancher;\nla souplesse lui permettant de quitter son poste de travail et de marcher ou de s'allonger lorsqu'il en sent le besoin.\n[241] L'offre du 20 ao\u00fbt 2004 de la CN, qui est toujours en vigueur, pr\u00e9voit qu'\u00e0 la fin de la formation de M. Smith, la CN r\u00e9novera le bureau du coordonnateur de formation des trains, y installera un plancher coussin\u00e9 et fournira \u00e0 M. Smith une chaise ergonomique convenable et un poste de travail ajustable.\n[242] M. Smith aurait aussi acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un lieu o\u00f9 il pourrait s'allonger et il aurait la possibilit\u00e9 de quitter son poste de travail lorsqu'il en a besoin. Il pourrait le faire parce que le poste de coordonnateur adjoint n'est pas un poste essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et qu'il n'a pas les responsabilit\u00e9s principales du coordonnateur de formation des trains.\n[243] La seule diff\u00e9rence entre l'offre de la CN et la proposition de M. Smith \u00e9tait que l'un des postes se trouvait \u00e0 Prince George et l'autre se trouvait \u00e0 Terrace. M. Smith n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il croyait qu'il \u00e9tait capable d'occuper le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains \u00e0 Terrace, mais pas \u00e0 Prince George.\n(ix) Plainte de M. Smith en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es [244] Dans sa plainte du 28 f\u00e9vrier 2002 \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, M. Smith soutient que la CN a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui en raison de son invalidit\u00e9 parce qu'elle n'a pas pris de mesures d'accommodement et qu'elle ne lui a pas offert d'emploi de substitution.\n[245] Au paragraphe 49 de son expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, dat\u00e9 du 6 juin 2006, M. Smith demande une ordonnance obligeant la CN \u00e0 lui trouver un accommodement raisonnable dans la r\u00e9gion de Terrace, soit en lui permettant d'occuper le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains, ou le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains, soit en lui offrant un autre emploi convenable.\n[246] Au paragraphe 52A de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, M. Smith demande une ordonnance obligeant la CN \u00e0 accepter sa demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 et \u00e0 rembourser les prestations auxquelles il n'a pas eu droit, parce qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler et que la CN ne lui a pas offert d'emploi convenable.\n[247] \u00c0 la fin de son t\u00e9moignage en septembre 2006, le Tribunal a pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 M. Smith au sujet des incoh\u00e9rences entre sa demande d'accommodement visant l'obtention d'un poste convenable \u00e0 Terrace et sa demande dans laquelle il tentait d'obtenir un remboursement des prestations auxquelles il avait droit parce qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler et que la CN ne lui avait pas offert d'emploi convenable.\n[248] L'avocat de M. Smith a \u00e9crit une lettre au Tribunal le 19 f\u00e9vrier 2007, dans laquelle il pr\u00e9sentait la r\u00e9ponse de son client selon laquelle il ne demandait plus la r\u00e9paration inscrite au paragraphe 49, soit que la CN lui offre un accommodement convenable \u00e0 Terrace.\n[249] Par l'entremise de son avocat, M. Smith a expliqu\u00e9 que :\n[traduction]\n[...] en partie en raison du r\u00e9sultat de la recommandation [...] \u00e0 Dr Keyes, sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question est qu'il ne souhaite pas poursuivre cette demande de r\u00e9paration, puisqu'il ne croit plus qu'il sera capable de se r\u00e9tablir suffisamment pour pouvoir travailler de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Ainsi, cela signifie que M. Smith reconna\u00eet maintenant, en r\u00e9trospective par rapport \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e 2007, qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de travailler pendant cette p\u00e9riode, pendant presque toute la p\u00e9riode touch\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente plainte [...] Il ne reconna\u00eet pas qu'il \u00e9tait [...] il ne le croyait pas, il ne l'a pas accept\u00e9 tant qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9 d'arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment. Il n'\u00e9tait pas du m\u00eame avis en 2001 ou en 2002. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, il esp\u00e9rait toujours qu'avec le temps, il serait capable de travailler. Bien entendu, beaucoup de preuves existent pour \u00e9tayer le fait qu'il a essay\u00e9 de le faire.\nV. MOTIFS DE LA D\u00c9CISION A. La CN a-t-elle agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire ou a-t-elle exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles envers M. Smith en rejetant sa demande de pension d'invalidit\u00e9 de la CN? [250] Pour avoir gain de cause, M. Smith doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination. Pour ce faire, il doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il r\u00e9pondait au crit\u00e8re d'admissibilit\u00e9 de la pension d'invalidit\u00e9 lorsque sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\n[251] Pour \u00e9tablir prima facie qu'il y a eu des repr\u00e9sailles, M. Smith doit d\u00e9montrer que sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la CCDP.\n[252] En ce qui a trait aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination, M. Smith a soutenu que, en r\u00e9trospective par rapport \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e 2007, il a conclu qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas capable de travailler de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Ses motifs sont fond\u00e9s en partie sur son renvoi au Dr Keyes.\n[253] La d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 savoir si M. Smith est atteint d'une invalidit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te et permanente l'emp\u00eachant de travailler doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur des preuves m\u00e9dicales objectives. La seule preuve m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 ce sujet est la lettre du 3 mars 2004 que le Dr Appleton a \u00e9crite \u00e0 qui de droit, dans laquelle il d\u00e9clarait qu'il \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Smith \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement invalide et ne pouvait plus travailler.\n[254] Cependant, il faut accorder tr\u00e8s peu de poids \u00e0 cet avis, pour un certain nombre de raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, l'avis m\u00e9dical a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit \u00e0 la demande de M. Smith. Il a avis\u00e9 le Dr Appleton de l'appel au RPC et lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait besoin de son soutien.\n[255] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le Dr Appleton, dans sa lettre du 28 mars 2002 en soutien \u00e0 la demande d'assurance-emploi de M. Smith, a indiqu\u00e9 que M. Smith pouvait retourner au travail le 10 juin 2001.\n[256] Troisi\u00e8mement, le Dr Appleton, qui est le m\u00e9decin praticien qui conna\u00eet le mieux l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de M. Smith, n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner pendant l'audience, m\u00eame si la premi\u00e8re semaine de l'audience a eu lieu \u00e0 Terrace, o\u00f9 le Dr Appleton habite. Pendant les autres semaines, l'audience a eu lieu \u00e0 Vancouver. L'avocat de M. Smith a mentionn\u00e9 au Tribunal que le Dr Appleton serait \u00e0 Vancouver pendant l'une de ces semaines.\n[257] M. Smith n'a donn\u00e9 aucune explication quant au fait que le Dr Appleton n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal.\n[258] Quatri\u00e8mement, les notes cliniques du Dr Appleton et ses rapports de m\u00e9decin traitant pour la WCB ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour le docteur pendant l'audience. Cependant, en l'absence du Dr Appleton, la CN a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de contre-interroger le t\u00e9moin et de tester la validit\u00e9 de son avis m\u00e9dical au sujet de M. Smith. Pour la m\u00eame raison, l'\u00e9valuation que le Dr Appleton a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 que M. Smith a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la CN n'a pas pu \u00eatre v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e en contre-interrogation.\n[259] Cinqui\u00e8mement, certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrent que le Dr Appleton a agi comme mandataire pour M. Smith. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments comprennent les lettres du 28 mars 2002 et du 3 mars 2004, qu'il a \u00e9crites \u00e0 la demande de M. Smith.\n[260] Parmi ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve se trouve aussi l'intervention, au nom de M. Smith, aupr\u00e8s de M. Beddie. Le Dr Appleton avait demand\u00e9 une r\u00e9union en personne avec M. Smith, la CN et les responsables de la WCB afin de trouver une solution \u00e0 la situation de travail de M. Smith.\n[261] Finalement, le fait qu'aucun des sp\u00e9cialistes qui ont examin\u00e9 M. Smith, y compris le Dr Wing, le Dr Clarke et le Dr Keyes, n'a offert un avis m\u00e9dical selon lequel M. Smith \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement invalide et ne pouvait plus travailler.\n[262] Cependant, c'est plus que l'absence de preuve m\u00e9dicale objective qui me porte \u00e0 conclure que M. Smith \u00e9tait capable de travailler. Ses propres actions, de 2002 \u00e0 2004, nient la conclusion qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler.\n[263] Au m\u00eame moment o\u00f9 M. Smith recevait des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC, \u00e0 partir de juin 2002, M. Smith :\na demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son syndicat, le 9 juillet 2003, de porter en arbitrage son grief au sujet du fait que la CN devait lui trouver un emploi convenable \u00e0 Terrace;\na, en juillet 2004, discut\u00e9 avec l'avocat du syndicat et a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9, par t\u00e9l\u00e9copie \u00e0 l'avocat, que la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitrage devrait \u00eatre maintenue et que la CN avait l'obligation de lui trouver un emploi \u00e0 Terrace;\na maintenu son appel au WCAT en novembre 2005, dans lequel il soutenait que la WCB avait l'obligation de lui trouver du travail \u00e0 Terrace avant de lui en chercher ailleurs;\na propos\u00e9, lors de l'audience devant le Tribunal en septembre 2006, qu'une mesure d'accommodement acceptable serait que la CN lui offre le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains \u00e0 Terrace;\na, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de juin 2006, demand\u00e9 par voie de recours \u00e0 ce qu'on lui donne le poste de coordonnateur ou de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains, \u00e0 Terrace, ou tout autre emploi de substitution acceptable. M. Smith a seulement retir\u00e9 cette demande en f\u00e9vrier 2007, lorsqu'on lui a fait remarquer les incoh\u00e9rences entre cette demande et celle qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la CN, soit d'approuver sa demande de prestation d'invalidit\u00e9 de la CN;\na, dans son courriel du 29 juin 2006 \u00e0 David Trite, le coordonnateur de retour au travail de la CN, exprim\u00e9 le fait qu'il serait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par tout travail que lui-m\u00eame ou le gestionnaire \u00e0 Terrace sugg\u00e9rerait et qui respecte ses capacit\u00e9s;\nn'a jamais avis\u00e9 le RPC, comme il avait accept\u00e9 de le faire dans sa demande au RPC, qu'il avait suivi une formation d'essai en juillet 2003 et en janvier 2004, ni qu'il travaillait comme b\u00e9n\u00e9vole pour la NIWA;\nn'a pas avis\u00e9 la CN, l'avocat du syndicat ni l'arbitre qu'il recevait des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 parce qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler.\n[264] Il est \u00e9vident que M. Smith croyait qu'il \u00e9tait capable de travailler, que ce soit comme coordonnateur de formation des trains, comme coordonnateur adjoint ou dans tout autre poste convenable \u00e0 Terrace.\n[265] Je conclus qu'en l'absence de toute preuve m\u00e9dicale cr\u00e9dible et objective, et compte tenu des actions et du point de vue de M. Smith, il n'est pas atteint d'une invalidit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te et permanente qui l'emp\u00eache de travailler.\n[266] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la CN a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la CCDP, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Lapierre qui soutenait qu'il avait pris sa d\u00e9cision en fonction d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments objectifs et qu'il n'avait pas tenu compte de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de M. Smith.\nB. La CN a-t-elle pris des mesures d'accommodement pour M. Smith? [267] M. Smith soutient qu'il \u00e9tait atteint d'une invalidit\u00e9, qu'il ne pouvait pas reprendre l'emploi qu'il occupait avant de se blesser et que la CN lui a offert un emploi de substitution convenable. Si l'on accepte que M. Smith a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, la question est de d\u00e9terminer si la CN a pris des mesures d'accommodement pour son invalidit\u00e9.\n[268] Il existe deux principes de droit, \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] R.C.S. 970, qui sont pertinents en l'esp\u00e8ce. Premi\u00e8rement la Cour a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les mesures que l'auteur de la discrimination doit prendre pour s'entendre avec le plaignant sont limit\u00e9es par les expressions raisonnables et sans s'imposer de contrainte excessive. Il s'agit l\u00e0 non pas de crit\u00e8res ind\u00e9pendants, mais de diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons d'exprimer le m\u00eame concept. Ce qui constitue des mesures raisonnables est une question de fait qui variera selon les circonstances de l'affaire.\n[269] Le deuxi\u00e8me principe de l'arr\u00eat Renaud est le fait que lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 demande un accommodement, il doit accepter tout accommodement raisonnable, m\u00eame s'il ne s'agit pas de la mesure qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re. Si l'employ\u00e9 refuse une offre d'accommodement qui est raisonnable compte tenu des circonstances, alors l'employeur est acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation.\n[270] Il convient d'examiner toutes les circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 la demande de la WCB, la CN a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le PRT no 1 qui devait commencer en d\u00e9cembre 2000. Il s'agissait d'un PRT progressif qui tenait compte des t\u00e2ches d'un m\u00e9canicien de locomotive, des limites de travail de M. Smith pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es par la WCB, du rapport WorkAble de 1999 et des discussions avec M. Smith au sujet de ses tol\u00e9rances et de ses activit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce moment.\n[271] Le plan a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9 par le Dr Appleton, le Dr Wing et le Dr Faraday, qui avaient confirm\u00e9 les restrictions de travail de M. Smith. M. Smith n'a pas termin\u00e9 ce PRT.\n[272] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une suggestion que M. Smith avait faite plus t\u00f4t, la CN a \u00e9labor\u00e9 le PRT no 2 qui devait d\u00e9buter en mars 2001. Il s'agissait d'un PRT progressif qui comprenait des t\u00e2ches all\u00e9g\u00e9es et du travail dans le parc de locomotives local, qui \u00e9vitait que M. Smith reste en position assise prolong\u00e9e dans la cabine de locomotive. Le Dr Coppin et le Dr Appleton ont tous les deux conclu qu'il s'agissait d'un plan raisonnable. M. Smith n'a pas termin\u00e9 ce PRT.\n[273] Le PRT no 3 a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 par M. Wiederspiel du syndicat, qui a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la CN de r\u00e9activer le plan pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. La CN a accept\u00e9 et a modifi\u00e9 le plan en tenant compte des suggestions du syndicat.\n[274] M. Smith a aussi examin\u00e9 le plan et a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 des modifications suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 Mme Dawson. Il n'a jamais dit \u00e0 Mme Dawson qu'il s'opposait \u00e0 ce plan modifi\u00e9.\n[275] Il est clair que l'objectif de la WCB et de la CN \u00e9tait de r\u00e9attribuer M. Smith au poste qu'il occupait avant de se blesser. M. Smith doutait certainement de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire. Le Dr Appleton avait recommand\u00e9 que M. Smith \u00e9vite de rester assis de fa\u00e7on prolong\u00e9e, et le Dr McDougall, le Dr Faraday et le Dr Wing avaient souscrit \u00e0 cette recommandation.\n[276] Compte tenu du fait que les PRT ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9s et prescrits afin de servir de programme de retour au travail progressif qui respectait la recommandation du Dr Appleton, du fait que les PRT no 1 et no 2 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s non seulement par la WCB, mais aussi par les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux de M. Smith et les conseillers de la CN, et du fait que le PRT no 3 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande du syndicat de M. Smith, je conclus que ces trois PRT constituaient des mesures d'accommodement raisonnables au sens du principe Renaud.\n[277] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode d'avril 2001 \u00e0 mars 2003, les responsables de l'exploitation \u00e0 Terrace et l'\u00e9quipe de retour au travail de M. Smith ont examin\u00e9 d'autres emplois possibles pour lui \u00e0 Terrace. M. Smith a aussi offert des suggestions \u00e0 des agents du personnel de la CN \u00e0 Edmonton.\n[278] La preuve d\u00e9montre qu'il n'y avait pas de possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi \u00e0 Terrace qui conviendraient \u00e0 M. Smith, sauf si l'on cr\u00e9ait un poste qui n'\u00e9tait pas requis. Les suggestions de M. Smith ne lui permettaient pas de s'assurer un emploi r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme.\n[279] En mai 2003, la CN et la WCB, avec l'appui du syndicat, ont propos\u00e9 le PRT no 4 afin d'offrir \u00e0 M. Smith le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George. Sa formation a eu lieu en juin et juillet 2003. Une fois de plus, M. Smith n'a pas termin\u00e9 sa formation et le plan a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9.\n[280] En janvier 2004, la CN a offert \u00e0 M. Smith le PRT no 5, soit le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains \u00e0 Prince George. Cette offre devait entrer en vigueur imm\u00e9diatement. M. Smith n'avait qu'\u00e0 terminer le programme de formation. Il n'a pas accept\u00e9 l'offre. Elle est toujours en attente.\n[281] La preuve d\u00e9montre d\u00e9finitivement que le poste de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains est le [traduction] poste id\u00e9al pour M. Smith, compte tenu de ses restrictions de travail. Il lui permet d'\u00eatre assis, de se lever et de marcher lorsqu'il en ressent le besoin. Il peut quitter son lieu de travail et se rendre \u00e0 une pi\u00e8ce d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour s'allonger. Le poste n'en est pas un qui est essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[282] Le tribunal de r\u00e9vision de la WCB a aussi conclu qu'il s'agissait du poste id\u00e9al pour M. Smith dans sa d\u00e9cision du 14 mars 2003. Le WCAT a eu la m\u00eame opinion dans sa d\u00e9cision du 10 f\u00e9vrier 2006. L'arbitre Pich\u00e9 a conclu que le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e9tait un accommodement raisonnable qui convenait \u00e0 l'invalidit\u00e9 de M. Smith, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la LCDP.\n[283] M. Smith a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ses spasmes musculaires, qu'il avait ressentis pendant sa formation, l'emp\u00eachaient d'occuper le poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains. Cependant, c'est ce que M. Smith a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au Dr Appleton, dans ses journaux et devant le Tribunal. Cette preuve n'est pas objective et ne peut pas \u00eatre v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante, comme le WCAT l'a fait remarquer. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 not\u00e9, M. Smith a eu la possibilit\u00e9 d'appeler le Dr Appleton \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, ou tout autre m\u00e9decin qui l'avait \u00e9valu\u00e9. Il a choisi de ne pas le faire.\n[284] Dans ses notes cliniques du 7 f\u00e9vrier 2006, le Dr Appleton a \u00e9crit qu'il \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il y avait une composante largement \u00e9motionnelle aux spasmes musculaires de M. Smith et qu'il ne pouvait pas trouver de raison physiologique aux spasmes.\n[285] \u00c0 ce sujet, je conviens avec la conclusion du WCAT selon laquelle M. Smith a lui-m\u00eame caus\u00e9 la majeure partie des difficult\u00e9s qu'il a eues pendant sa formation comme coordonnateur de formation des trains.\n[286] Il faut aussi tenir compte du fait que M. Smith a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 insister, devant le WCAT et devant le Tribunal, qu'il devait obtenir un poste de coordonnateur de formation des trains \u00e0 Terrace. S'il \u00e9tait capable d'occuper ce poste \u00e0 Terrace, alors il \u00e9tait capable de le faire \u00e0 Prince George. Je peux seulement conclure que M. Smith n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager de Terrace \u00e0 Prince George.\n[287] L'obligation de M. Smith, en vertu de l'arr\u00eat Renaud, est d'accepter tout accommodement raisonnable. Il ne peut pas s'attendre \u00e0 une solution parfaite. L'offre de la CN de lui donner un poste de coordonnateur ou de coordonnateur adjoint de formation des trains est un accommodement raisonnable compte tenu des circonstances. M. Smith ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Renaud. La CN s'est donc acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement.\n[288] M. Smith a aussi soutenu que la CN a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui en raison de sa situation familiale. Il a fait valoir que le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement \u00e0 Prince George aurait un effet n\u00e9gatif pour Mme Smith. Elle devrait d\u00e9missionner de son poste de biblioth\u00e9caire adjointe \u00e0 Terrace.\n[289] La situation familiale n'est pas un motif qui figure dans la plainte de M. Smith. Dans ses observations finales, il n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui appuie l'argument selon lequel il y a eu discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation familiale.\n[290] De plus, je souscris \u00e0 l'opinion de l'arbitre Pich\u00e9 selon laquelle l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pr\u00e9vue par la LCDP ne rend pas l'employeur responsable des aspects \u00e9conomiques et familiaux de l'employ\u00e9.\nVI. CONCLUSION [291] La CN a pris des mesures d'accommodement pour l'invalidit\u00e9 de M. Smith. Elle n'a pas fait preuve de discrimination et n'a pas exerc\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sailles envers M.

Hadjis Date : Le 16 mai 2008 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2008 TCDP 16\n[1] Un certain nombre de parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des lettres aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal au cours des deux derni\u00e8res semaines concernant les portions censur\u00e9es de certains documents divulgu\u00e9s par la Commission. Afin de mieux comprendre les questions en litige, le 12 mai 2008, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de me fournir la version \u00e9lectronique des documents en question, dans leur forme censur\u00e9e. Mme Kulaszka a bien voulu fournir les documents le 13 mai 2008.\n[2] J\u2019ai maintenant eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019examiner lesdits documents. Ils \u00e9taient apparemment empaquet\u00e9s en huit groupes dont voici la liste :\n- Deux m\u00e9moires r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par le service de police de London (Ontario) pour le bureau du procureur de la Couronne, dat\u00e9s respectivement du 28 septembre 2001 et du 1er f\u00e9vrier 2002. Ils portent sur une enqu\u00eate au sujet de James Scott Richardson, qui \u00e9tait intim\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Warman c. Kulbashian et al., 2006 TCDP 11, tranch\u00e9e par le Tribunal le 10 mars 2006. La plupart des renseignements censur\u00e9s semblent \u00eatre le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es des enqu\u00eateurs de la police, des t\u00e9moins et d\u2019autres individus. - Des courriers \u00e9lectroniques envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 partir d\u2019un compte MSN Hotmail. Ils semblent tous porter sur le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (CECT), \u00e9galement intim\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, Warman c. Kulbashian et al. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments censur\u00e9s semblent \u00eatre des noms et des coordonn\u00e9es.\n- Un courrier \u00e9lectronique de Dean Steacy au sujet de la m\u00eame affaire, dont le destinataire est un [Traduction] D\u00e9t. [d\u00e9tective, selon ce que j\u2019en d\u00e9duis], dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9.\n- Une copie d\u2019un mandat de perquisition qui porte encore sur le CECT. Le nom du demandeur et l\u2019adresse o\u00f9 la perquisition doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e sont censur\u00e9s.\n- Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par Dean Steacy portant sur sa conversation avec un agent au sujet d\u2019Alexan Kulbashian et du CECT. Le nom et l\u2019adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique de l\u2019agent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s.\n- Une photographie signal\u00e9tique de M. Richardson prise par le service de police de London. L\u2019image de son visage ainsi que sa date de naissance, sa taille et son poids ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s.\n- Un extrait de ce qui semble \u00eatre le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission concernant l\u2019affaire Warman c. Kulbashian et al., pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Les noms d\u2019un ou de plusieurs policiers ayant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019affaire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. - Un courrier \u00e9lectronique envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Steacy par quelqu\u2019un du service de police de London, dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, au sujet de la plainte mentionn\u00e9e ci\u2011dessus contre M. Kulbashian et al.\n- Deux m\u00e9moires r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par le service de police de London pour le procureur de la Couronne au sujet de M. Richardson, dat\u00e9s respectivement du 1er f\u00e9vrier 2002 et du 14 f\u00e9vrier 2002. Les noms et les pseudonymes utilis\u00e9s par les enqu\u00eateurs de la police ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. Les noms et coordonn\u00e9es des personnes interrog\u00e9es dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate semblent \u00e9galement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s.\n- Une version non censur\u00e9e et une version censur\u00e9e d\u2019un seul et m\u00eame acte d\u2019accusation concernant les accusations au criminel d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre M. Richardson.\n- Un courrier \u00e9lectronique entre Harvey Goldberg et quelqu\u2019un du B\u2019Nai Brith, dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s.\n- De la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre le bureau de l\u2019ancien pr\u00e9sident de la CCDP Maxwell Yalden et le Toronto Mayor\u2019s Committee on Community and Race Relations. Le nom de la personne avec laquelle le pr\u00e9sident correspond a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, de m\u00eame que le nom d\u2019une personne du Simon Wiesenthal Center qui est mentionn\u00e9e dans la correspondance.\n- Des lettres \u00e9crites par M. Steacy \u00e0 un caporal de l\u2019escouade des crimes haineux de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s.\n- Des notes aux dossiers r\u00e9dig\u00e9es par M. Steacy au sujet de conversations qu\u2019il a eues avec un agent et un caporal de l\u2019escouade des crimes haineux de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, dont les noms et coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9es. Les notes portent sur le groupe BCWhitePride, qui est intim\u00e9 dans la plainte relative aux droits de la personne renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal (C.R.A.R.R. c. www.bcwhitepride.com, dossier du Tribunal no T1120\/0206).\n- Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet de communications qu\u2019il a eues avec le [Traduction] bureau de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale d\u2019une organisation dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9. Le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es des individus contact\u00e9s ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s.\n- Un courrier \u00e9lectronique de M. Steacy \u00e0 un policier de London (Ontario) dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s, de m\u00eame que des notes au dossier s\u2019y rapportant. Le sujet du courrier \u00e9lectronique est [Traduction] Plainte au sujet du CECT.\n- Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet de conversations qu\u2019il a eues avec quelqu\u2019un de la division des crimes haineux de la police d\u2019Edmonton, dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. La note concerne Peter Kouba, qui est l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans une plainte relative aux droits de la personne renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal (Warman c. Kouba, dossier du Tribunal no T1070\/5205). Les coordonn\u00e9es de M. Kouba ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9es.\n- Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet de conversations qu\u2019il a eues avec un caporal de l\u2019escouade antigang de la police de Montr\u00e9al et un enqu\u00eateur du bureau de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale de la GRC. Le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es des policiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. Les conversations portaient sur une plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Le nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9.\n- Un courrier \u00e9lectronique entre M. Steacy et une personne dont l\u2019adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique se termine par police.london.ca. Le nom du correspondant a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, de m\u00eame que les coordonn\u00e9es de M. Steacy.\n- Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet d\u2019une conversation qu\u2019il a eue avec un t\u00e9moin dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, \u00e0 propos d\u2019une plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Les noms du plaignant et de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s.\n- Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet d\u2019une conversation qu\u2019il a eu avec un agent, dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, \u00e0 propos de la plainte contre le CECT mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n- Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par quelqu\u2019un de la Commission, dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, \u00e0 propos d\u2019une conversation avec un caporal de l\u2019escouade des crimes contre la personne du d\u00e9tachement de Vancouver de la GRC, dont le nom a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9. La conversation portait sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre www.bcwhitepride.com.\n- Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet d\u2019un d\u00e9tective dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. La note porte sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par un plaignant, dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s, contre un intim\u00e9, dont le nom n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9. L\u2019adresse d\u2019une personne mentionn\u00e9e dans la note a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9e.\n- Une s\u00e9rie de courriers \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre M. Goldberg et quelqu\u2019un qui semble travailler pour le service de police de Winnipeg. Le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s, de m\u00eame que ce qui semble \u00eatre de nombreuses lignes de texte. Il m\u2019est difficile d\u2019\u00e9mettre une hypoth\u00e8se sur ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du texte qui reste.\n- Un courrier \u00e9lectronique qu\u2019ont re\u00e7u M. Steacy, M. Goldberg et d\u2019autres personnes (dont les noms ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s) de quelqu\u2019un dont le nom a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9. De nombreuses lignes (pr\u00e9sentant probablement des coordonn\u00e9es) \u00e0 la fin du courrier \u00e9lectronique ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9es.\nApr\u00e8s examen des documents du groupe 8, je n\u2019y ai pas vu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments censur\u00e9s.\n[3] Par cons\u00e9quent, il me semble que la plupart des extraits censur\u00e9s portent sur le nom des individus et leur coordonn\u00e9es. J\u2019ordonne donc \u00e0 la Commission de me fournir d\u2019ici le 20 mai 2008 une copie non censur\u00e9e des documents pour que je puisse v\u00e9rifier cette conclusion.\n[4] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal oblige les parties \u00e0 divulguer les documents qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle, soit tout ce qui pourrait \u00eatre pertinent. La question qui saute aux yeux, en cons\u00e9quence, est la suivante : dans quelle mesure le nom, l\u2019adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique, le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, le poids, la taille, etc., des individus mentionn\u00e9s dans ces documents sont\u2011ils pertinents selon le crit\u00e8re de la proportionnalit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103, sur lequel s\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs fond\u00e9 le Tribunal pour ordonner la divulgation (voir Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 32, aux paragraphes 32 et suivants)?\n[5] Quand j\u2019aurai examin\u00e9 la version non censur\u00e9e des documents, je ferai savoir aux parties si la nature des renseignements censur\u00e9s diff\u00e8re de la description que je viens de faire et de quelle fa\u00e7on ils en diff\u00e8rent. Les parties qui ont demand\u00e9 la divulgation des parties censur\u00e9es seront alors invit\u00e9es \u00e0 me soumettre leurs observations quant \u00e0 la pertinence de ces renseignements. Si je suis convaincu qu\u2019un renseignement censur\u00e9 est pertinent, la Commission sera tenue de soumettre ses observations quant au privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation qu\u2019elle pourrait invoquer pour emp\u00eacher la communication des renseignements (alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles).\n[6] \u00c0 un autre sujet, la CAFE a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des lettres dat\u00e9es du 6 mai et du 8 mai 2008, dans lesquelles elle demande ceci :\nUne des demandes porte sur la divulgation censur\u00e9e des documents en question ci\u2011dessus. J\u2019avais l\u2019intention de me pencher sur cette question en commen\u00e7ant par examiner les documents censur\u00e9s en cause, ce que j\u2019ai maintenant fait dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. Une autre demande portait sur le calendrier de l\u2019audience, question sur laquelle je me suis pench\u00e9 dans le cadre de ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 12 mai 2008, mais qui fait maintenant l\u2019objet d\u2019une nouvelle requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, pour laquelle les autres parties n\u2019ont pas encore soumis leurs observations. La CAFE souhaite \u00e9galement obtenir une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 la Commission de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une divulgation compl\u00e8te des documents qu\u2019elle a fournis la premi\u00e8re fois en janvier 2007, avec certaines parties censur\u00e9es, en invoquant le privil\u00e8ge que lui conf\u00e9rerait l\u2019article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9 dans ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate rendue pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, Warman c. Lemire, 2007 TCDP 21, au paragraphe 7, dans le cadre d\u2019audiences devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, seule la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale peut se prononcer sur une opposition \u00e0 la divulgation invoqu\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 37. La CAFE pr\u00e9tend que la Commission a [Traduction] retir\u00e9 son opposition. Cependant, je note qu\u2019il n\u2019est fait mention nulle part d\u2019un retrait dans la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le 15 janvier 2008, dossier no T\u2011860\u201107, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019opposition de la Commission \u00e0 ce que soient d\u00e9livr\u00e9es les assignations de Bell Canada. De toute fa\u00e7on, la question soumise \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne portait pas sur la divulgation de documents qui avait eu lieu un an plus t\u00f4t, en janvier 2007. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019ordonne pas la divulgation [Traduction] compl\u00e8te des documents pour lesquels la Commission a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019article 37. Finalement, la CAFE a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que la Commission divulgue tous les documents relatifs \u00e0 un certain nombre de comptes utilisateurs de courrier \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s, en affirmant qu\u2019ils sont [Traduction] grandement pertinents dans le cadre des questions soulev\u00e9es par M. Lemire dans sa requ\u00eate de nature constitutionnelle. Aucune autre explication n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie pour justifier quelle pourrait \u00eatre cette pertinence. Dans ces circonstances, je n\u2019ordonne pas leur divulgation.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthania Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 16 mai 2008\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1073\/5405\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Richard Warman c.

Ils \u00e9taient apparemment empaquet\u00e9s en huit groupes dont voici la liste :\n- Deux m\u00e9moires r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par le service de police de London (Ontario) pour le bureau du procureur de la Couronne, dat\u00e9s respectivement du 28 septembre 2001 et du 1er f\u00e9vrier 2002. Ils portent sur une enqu\u00eate au sujet de James Scott Richardson, qui \u00e9tait intim\u00e9 dans l'affaire Warman c. Kulbashian et al., 2006 TCDP 11, tranch\u00e9e par le Tribunal le 10 mars 2006. La plupart des renseignements censur\u00e9s semblent \u00eatre le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es des enqu\u00eateurs de la police, des t\u00e9moins et d'autres individus. - Des courriers \u00e9lectroniques envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 partir d'un compte MSN Hotmail. Ils semblent tous porter sur le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (CECT), \u00e9galement intim\u00e9 dans l'affaire pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, Warman c. Kulbashian et al. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments censur\u00e9s semblent \u00eatre des noms et des coordonn\u00e9es.\nUn courrier \u00e9lectronique de Dean Steacy au sujet de la m\u00eame affaire, dont le destinataire est un [traduction] D\u00e9t. [d\u00e9tective, selon ce que j'en d\u00e9duis], dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9.\n- Une copie d'un mandat de perquisition qui porte encore sur le CECT. Le nom du demandeur et l'adresse o\u00f9 la perquisition doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e sont censur\u00e9s.\nUne note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par Dean Steacy portant sur sa conversation avec un agent au sujet d'Alexan Kulbashian et du CECT. Le nom et l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique de l'agent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. Une photographie signal\u00e9tique de M. Richardson prise par le service de police de London. L'image de son visage ainsi que sa date de naissance, sa taille et son poids ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s.\n- Un extrait de ce qui semble \u00eatre le rapport d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission concernant l'affaire Warman c. Kulbashian et al., pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Les noms d'un ou de plusieurs policiers ayant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'affaire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. - Un courrier \u00e9lectronique envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Steacy par quelqu'un du service de police de London, dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, au sujet de la plainte mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus contre M. Kulbashian et al.\nDeux m\u00e9moires r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par le service de police de London pour le procureur de la Couronne au sujet de M. Richardson, dat\u00e9s respectivement du 1er f\u00e9vrier 2002 et du 14 f\u00e9vrier 2002. Les noms et les pseudonymes utilis\u00e9s par les enqu\u00eateurs de la police ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. Les noms et coordonn\u00e9es des personnes interrog\u00e9es dans le cadre de l'enqu\u00eate semblent \u00e9galement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. Une version non censur\u00e9e et une version censur\u00e9e d'un seul et m\u00eame acte d'accusation concernant les accusations au criminel d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre M. Richardson.\n- Un courrier \u00e9lectronique entre Harvey Goldberg et quelqu'un du B'Nai Brith, dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s.\nDe la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre le bureau de l'ancien pr\u00e9sident de la CCDP Maxwell Yalden et le Toronto Mayor's Committee on Community and Race Relations. Le nom de la personne avec laquelle le pr\u00e9sident correspond a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, de m\u00eame que le nom d'une personne du Simon Wiesenthal Center qui est mentionn\u00e9e dans la correspondance. Des lettres \u00e9crites par M. Steacy \u00e0 un caporal de l'escouade des crimes haineux de la Colombie-Britannique, dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. Des notes aux dossiers r\u00e9dig\u00e9es par M. Steacy au sujet de conversations qu'il a eues avec un agent et un caporal de l'escouade des crimes haineux de la Colombie-Britannique, dont les noms et coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9es. Les notes portent sur le groupe BCWhitePride, qui est intim\u00e9 dans la plainte relative aux droits de la personne renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal (C.R.A.R.R. c. www.bcwhitepride.com, dossier du Tribunal no T1120\/0206). Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet de communications qu'il a eues avec le [traduction] bureau de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale d'une organisation dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9. Le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es des individus contact\u00e9s ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. Un courrier \u00e9lectronique de M. Steacy \u00e0 un policier de London (Ontario) dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s, de m\u00eame que des notes au dossier s'y rapportant. Le sujet du courrier \u00e9lectronique est [traduction] Plainte au sujet du CECT. Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet de conversations qu'il a eues avec quelqu'un de la division des crimes haineux de la police d'Edmonton, dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. La note concerne Peter Kouba, qui est l'intim\u00e9 dans une plainte relative aux droits de la personne renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal (Warman c. Kouba, dossier du Tribunal no T1070\/5205). Les coordonn\u00e9es de M. Kouba ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9es. Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet de conversations qu'il a eues avec un caporal de l'escouade antigang de la police de Montr\u00e9al et un enqu\u00eateur du bureau de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale de la GRC. Le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es des policiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. Les conversations portaient sur une plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Le nom de l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9. Un courrier \u00e9lectronique entre M. Steacy et une personne dont l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique se termine par police.london.ca. Le nom du correspondant a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, de m\u00eame que les coordonn\u00e9es de M. Steacy. Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet d'une conversation qu'il a eue avec un t\u00e9moin dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, \u00e0 propos d'une plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Les noms du plaignant et de l'intim\u00e9 n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet d'une conversation qu'il a eu avec un agent, dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, \u00e0 propos de la plainte contre le CECT mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par quelqu'un de la Commission, dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9, \u00e0 propos d'une conversation avec un caporal de l'escouade des crimes contre la personne du d\u00e9tachement de Vancouver de la GRC, dont le nom a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9. La conversation portait sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre www.bcwhitepride.com. Une note au dossier r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Steacy au sujet d'un d\u00e9tective dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s. La note porte sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par un plaignant, dont le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s, contre un intim\u00e9, dont le nom n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9. L'adresse d'une personne mentionn\u00e9e dans la note a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9e.\n- Une s\u00e9rie de courriers \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre M. Goldberg et quelqu'un qui semble travailler pour le service de police de Winnipeg. Le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s, de m\u00eame que ce qui semble \u00eatre de nombreuses lignes de texte. Il m'est difficile d'\u00e9mettre une hypoth\u00e8se sur ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du texte qui reste.\nUn courrier \u00e9lectronique qu'ont re\u00e7u M. Steacy, M. Goldberg et d'autres personnes (dont les noms ont \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9s) de quelqu'un dont le nom a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9. De nombreuses lignes (pr\u00e9sentant probablement des coordonn\u00e9es) \u00e0 la fin du courrier \u00e9lectronique ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 censur\u00e9es.\nApr\u00e8s examen des documents du groupe 8, je n'y ai pas vu d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments censur\u00e9s.\n[3] Par cons\u00e9quent, il me semble que la plupart des extraits censur\u00e9s portent sur le nom des individus et leur coordonn\u00e9es. J'ordonne donc \u00e0 la Commission de me fournir d'ici le 20 mai 2008 une copie non censur\u00e9e des documents pour que je puisse v\u00e9rifier cette conclusion.\n[4] L'alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal oblige les parties \u00e0 divulguer les documents qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l'occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d'autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle, soit tout ce qui pourrait \u00eatre pertinent. La question qui saute aux yeux, en cons\u00e9quence, est la suivante : dans quelle mesure le nom, l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique, le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, le poids, la taille, etc., des individus mentionn\u00e9s dans ces documents sont-ils pertinents selon le crit\u00e8re de la proportionnalit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103, sur lequel s'est d'ailleurs fond\u00e9 le Tribunal pour ordonner la divulgation (voir Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 32, aux paragraphes 32 et suivants)?\n[5] Quand j'aurai examin\u00e9 la version non censur\u00e9e des documents, je ferai savoir aux parties si la nature des renseignements censur\u00e9s diff\u00e8re de la description que je viens de faire et de quelle fa\u00e7on ils en diff\u00e8rent. Les parties qui ont demand\u00e9 la divulgation des parties censur\u00e9es seront alors invit\u00e9es \u00e0 me soumettre leurs observations quant \u00e0 la pertinence de ces renseignements. Si je suis convaincu qu'un renseignement censur\u00e9 est pertinent, la Commission sera tenue de soumettre ses observations quant au privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation qu'elle pourrait invoquer pour emp\u00eacher la communication des renseignements (alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles).\n[6] \u00c0 un autre sujet, la CAFE a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des lettres dat\u00e9es du 6 mai et du 8 mai 2008, dans lesquelles elle demande ceci :\nUne des demandes porte sur la divulgation censur\u00e9e des documents en question ci-dessus. J'avais l'intention de me pencher sur cette question en commen\u00e7ant par examiner les documents censur\u00e9s en cause, ce que j'ai maintenant fait dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nUne autre demande portait sur le calendrier de l'audience, question sur laquelle je me suis pench\u00e9 dans le cadre de ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 12 mai 2008, mais qui fait maintenant l'objet d'une nouvelle requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, pour laquelle les autres parties n'ont pas encore soumis leurs observations.\nLa CAFE souhaite \u00e9galement obtenir une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 la Commission de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une divulgation compl\u00e8te des documents qu'elle a fournis la premi\u00e8re fois en janvier 2007, avec certaines parties censur\u00e9es, en invoquant le privil\u00e8ge que lui conf\u00e9rerait l'article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9 dans ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate rendue pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, Warman c. Lemire, 2007 TCDP 21, au paragraphe 7, dans le cadre d'audiences devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, seule la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale peut se prononcer sur une opposition \u00e0 la divulgation invoqu\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 37. La CAFE pr\u00e9tend que la Commission a [traduction] retir\u00e9 son opposition. Cependant, je note qu'il n'est fait mention nulle part d'un retrait dans la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le 15 janvier 2008, dossier no T-860-07, \u00e0 l'exception de l'opposition de la Commission \u00e0 ce que soient d\u00e9livr\u00e9es les assignations de Bell Canada. De toute fa\u00e7on, la question soumise \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne portait pas sur la divulgation de documents qui avait eu lieu un an plus t\u00f4t, en janvier 2007. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n'ordonne pas la divulgation [traduction] compl\u00e8te des documents pour lesquels la Commission a invoqu\u00e9 l'article 37.\nFinalement, la CAFE a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que la Commission divulgue tous les documents relatifs \u00e0 un certain nombre de comptes utilisateurs de courrier \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s, en affirmant qu'ils sont [traduction] grandement pertinents dans le cadre des questions soulev\u00e9es par M. Lemire dans sa requ\u00eate de nature constitutionnelle. Aucune autre explication n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie pour justifier quelle pourrait \u00eatre cette pertinence. Dans ces circonstances, je n'ordonne pas leur divulgation.\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[1] Le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (le minist\u00e8re) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate par laquelle il demande au Tribunal d'exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour refuser d'entendre la plainte actuelle de la plaignante au motif que la m\u00eame question a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e d\u00e9finitivement entre les parties en 2003, quand elles ont sign\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement dans le cadre d'une affaire impliquant les m\u00eames parties et soulevant des questions identiques (dossier du Tribunal no T683\/7101).\nLe contexte\n[2] En 1999, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne contre le Conseil des Mohawks de Kahnawake (CMK) et le minist\u00e8re. Elle soutient que le CMK ne l'a pas accept\u00e9e en tant que membre de la bande en raison de sa situation familiale et que ce rejet a fait en sorte qu'on lui a refus\u00e9 l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services du CMK. Elle pr\u00e9tend que le fait d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de ces services constitue un acte discriminatoire vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. En outre, elle soutient que le minist\u00e8re a \u00e9galement commis un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en continuant de subventionner le CMK pour la prestation des services qui lui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9s.\n[3] En 2003, la plaignante a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 \u00e0 l'amiable ses plaintes contre le CMK et le minist\u00e8re. Selon le r\u00e8glement amiable (l'entente de r\u00e8glement), la plaignante a accept\u00e9 d'exon\u00e9rer le minist\u00e8re [traduction] de toute obligation relative aux actions, aux r\u00e9clamations et aux demandes \u00e9ventuelles, de quelque nature que ce soit \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre le minist\u00e8re.\n[4] L'entente de r\u00e8glement a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Commission, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48(1) de la Loi, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 assimil\u00e9e, \u00e0 la demande de la Commission, \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, en vertu du paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi.\n[5] En 2005, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de nouvelles plaintes contre le CMK et le minist\u00e8re. Elle a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre le Conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s dans laquelle elle pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un acte discriminatoire contrevenant \u00e0 l'article 5 de la Loi quand le Conseil a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 25 juillet 2005, qu'elle ne satisfaisait pas aux [traduction] crit\u00e8res d'appartenance pour \u00eatre reconnue comme membre de la bande. Dans sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 2005 contre le minist\u00e8re, la plaignante soutient que l'acte discriminatoire commis [traduction] \u00e0 son endroit par le Conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s \u00e9tait une [traduction] cons\u00e9quence directe des actes du minist\u00e8re, qui [traduction] autorisait ce type de discrimination et [traduction] n'intervenait pas pour l'emp\u00eacher. La plaignante tient \u00e9galement le minist\u00e8re responsable du fait que le CMK l'a priv\u00e9e de certains services.\nLa question de la chose jug\u00e9e\n[6] Le minist\u00e8re invoque la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e pour soutenir que le Tribunal ne peut permettre \u00e0 la plaignante de reprendre son action contre le minist\u00e8re et de remettre en litige les questions qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1999 contre le minist\u00e8re et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on valide et d\u00e9finitive par l'entente de r\u00e8glement.\n[7] Pour que la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e s'applique :\nles questions \u00e0 trancher et les faits \u00e0 l'origine de l'action doivent \u00eatre les m\u00eames dans les deux instances; la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e comme cr\u00e9ant la pr\u00e9clusion doit \u00eatre une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive; les parties ou leurs ayants droit doivent \u00eatre les m\u00eames.\n(Voir O'Connor c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2006 TCDP 5, au paragraphe 27.)\n[8] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le minist\u00e8re soutient que la plaignante a soulev\u00e9 les m\u00eames questions ou all\u00e9gu\u00e9 les m\u00eames faits dans les deux plaintes en insistant sur le pouvoir et l'obligation du minist\u00e8re d'intervenir et d'emp\u00eacher les actes discriminatoires commis par le CMK dans la prestation de services et d'avantages.\n[9] Le minist\u00e8re soutient que son r\u00f4le n'a pas chang\u00e9 depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte en 1999. Cependant, rien dans la preuve dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi n'\u00e9taye cette affirmation, \u00e0 ce stade-ci de l'instruction. Les parties n'ont m\u00eame pas encore d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, comme le pr\u00e9voient les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[10] En outre, la plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 2005 que les actes discriminatoires suppos\u00e9ment commis par le minist\u00e8re sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s refusant de reconna\u00eetre son appartenance \u00e0 la bande. Le minist\u00e8re soutient que les activit\u00e9s du Conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre assimil\u00e9es \u00e0 celles du CMK et ainsi les parties aux plaintes de m\u00eame que les questions soulev\u00e9es seraient identiques en 1999 et en 2005. Toutefois, rien dans la preuve dont dispose le Tribunal au moment pr\u00e9sent ne confirme cet argument.\n[11] Qui plus est, la plaignante invoque, dans sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 2005, une loi sur l'appartenance (Membership Law) que le CMK a adopt\u00e9e en 2004 (apr\u00e8s l'entente de r\u00e8glement), qui a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans l'acte discriminatoire dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime en n'\u00e9tant pas reconnue comme membre de la bande. Le minist\u00e8re r\u00e9pond que ce fait [traduction] nouveau n'est pas pertinent, car les principales questions soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes de 1999 et de 2005 sont les m\u00eames, \u00e0 savoir si le minist\u00e8re a le pouvoir, en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, d'agir quant \u00e0 la reconnaissance du statut de la plaignante en tant que membre de la bande du CMK. Il est soutenu que cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans le r\u00e8glement et que la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e nous emp\u00eache de l'examiner \u00e0 nouveau. Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, la question concernant la loi sur l'appartenance et ses r\u00e9percussions en l'esp\u00e8ce est une question qui doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e \u00e0 partir d'une preuve.\n[12] Je conclus donc que le moyen pr\u00e9liminaire invoqu\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 en ce moment. Je tire une conclusion semblable \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'observation subsidiaire du minist\u00e8re voulant que poursuivre la pr\u00e9sente instruction constitue de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure. Je n'affirme pas que les all\u00e9gations du minist\u00e8re soient sans fondement, mais il me faut un dossier plus complet avant de me prononcer.\n[13] Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que je rejette la requ\u00eate du minist\u00e8re au moment pr\u00e9sent, je conserve le droit au minist\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate semblable \u00e0 un moment ult\u00e9rieur dans la proc\u00e9dure.\nAthanasios D.

Jensen Date : Le 4 juin 2008 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2008 TCDP 19\n[1] Les plaignantes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce soutiennent que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis contre elles un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la religion en ne les embauchant pas ou en mettant fin \u00e0 leur emploi parce qu\u2019elles refusaient de raccourcir leur jupe ou de porter des pantalons au travail. Les plaignantes sont des femmes musulmanes pratiquantes et pieuses. Elles couvrent leur corps, ce qui se traduit par, entre autres choses, le port de longues jupes et du foulard. Le premier formulaire de plainte all\u00e8gue seulement qu\u2019il y a eu acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la religion. La Commission souhaite faire ajouter la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe aux motifs de la plainte.\n[2] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Commission d\u00e9clare que la modification propos\u00e9e d\u00e9coule du m\u00eame ensemble de faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s que les plaintes originales et qu\u2019elle n\u2019invoquera pas de nouveaux faits \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la modification propos\u00e9e. Compte tenu de cette affirmation et de la d\u00e9claration de la Commission selon laquelle elle a l\u2019intention de s\u2019appuyer sur les documents produits par les parties dans le cadre des plaintes, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, United Parcel Service, ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[3] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour modifier les plaintes. La question est de savoir si la modification propos\u00e9e compromettrait gravement l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. Si une modification propos\u00e9e risque de faire prendre \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate une nouvelle voie impr\u00e9vue, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la modification n\u2019est pas accept\u00e9e. La question concr\u00e8te est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de savoir si la partie intim\u00e9e dispose d\u2019un pr\u00e9avis suffisant pour que soient respect\u00e9s les principes de justice naturelle (Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1, au paragraphe 18).\n[4] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la modification demand\u00e9e ne toucherait pas les all\u00e9gations factuelles \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans les plaintes. Elle ne ferait que mettre de l\u2019avant un second motif de distinction illicite. Ce changement ne d\u00e9savantage pas l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisqu\u2019il ne touche pas les faits en question dans les plaintes. Les all\u00e9gations de la plainte englobent tant le sexe que la religion comme motif du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 acte discriminatoire. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas fait valoir qu\u2019elle subirait un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la suite de la modification.\n[5] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de la Commission visant \u00e0 faire modifier la plainte pour qu\u2019y soit ajout\u00e9e une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe est accueillie.\nSign\u00e9e par\nKaren A.

Hadjis\n[1] L'intim\u00e9e, Greyhound Canada Transportation Corp. (Greyhound), soutient que la plaignante, Rachel Tourangeau, a fait preuve d'une [traduction] indiff\u00e9rence totale dans la proc\u00e9dure relative \u00e0 sa plainte et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle a abandonn\u00e9 sa poursuite. Greyhound a donc d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte.\nLes faits [2] Mme Tourangeau a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), le 13 avril 2006. Dans sa plainte, elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le personnel de la gare d'autobus Greyhound de Fort McMurray, en Alberta, l'a trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en raison de sa race et de son origine nationale ou ethnique quand elle a voulu prendre son billet et monter \u00e0 bord d'un autobus le 10 mars 2006.\n[3] La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 sa plainte devant le Tribunal le 8 mars 2007 et a joint un formulaire pr\u00e9sentant les coordonn\u00e9es [traduction] actuelles des parties. Le Tribunal, \u00e0 son tour, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer avec les parties dans le cadre de sa proc\u00e9dure de gestion de cas. Malheureusement, les tentatives du Tribunal pour joindre Mme Tourangeau \u00e0 l'adresse fournie par la Commission se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es vaines. Les lettres que lui a post\u00e9es le Tribunal, notamment les avis la convoquant \u00e0 participer aux conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de gestion d'instance, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9es sans indication du bureau de poste qu'elle avait d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9.\n[4] La Commission a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle ne connaissait pas la nouvelle adresse de Mme Tourangeau, mais qu'elle avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 trouver l'adresse de sa fille. La Commission a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que cette adresse soit utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 la place pour signifier les documents \u00e0 Mme Tourangeau. Le Tribunal a donc envoy\u00e9 une lettre par la poste \u00e0 Mme Tourangeau, \u00e0 l'adresse de sa fille. La lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e au Tribunal, marqu\u00e9e de la mention [traduction] non r\u00e9clam\u00e9e .\n[5] Le 30 octobre 2007, Greyhound a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal. Greyhound a envoy\u00e9 une copie de son avis de requ\u00eate \u00e0 Mme Tourangeau, \u00e0 l'adresse de sa fille, par courrier recommand\u00e9. Cette fois-ci, la fille de Mme Tourangeau a accept\u00e9 le document et, le 28 novembre 2007, Mme Tourangeau a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au Tribunal pour lui fournir ses nouvelles coordonn\u00e9es.\n[6] Le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2007, Mme Tourangeau a post\u00e9 ses observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, dans lesquelles observations elle affirme \u00eatre [traduction] encore int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 faire instruire sa plainte contre Greyhound et \u00eatre [traduction] vraiment d\u00e9sol\u00e9e que le Tribunal ait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de la joindre par courrier ou par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait [traduction] certaine d'avoir donn\u00e9 sa nouvelle adresse \u00e0 [traduction] quelqu'un des droits de la personne qui avait communiqu\u00e9 avec elle plus t\u00f4t dans la proc\u00e9dure.\nAnalyse [7] Greyhound soutient que le Tribunal devrait rejeter la plainte de Mme Tourangeau parce qu'elle [traduction] n'a pas fait avancer sa propre plainte et n'a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure en aucune mani\u00e8re depuis le tout d\u00e9but du processus de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte .\n[8] Le Tribunal peut rejeter une action pour retard ou d\u00e9faut de poursuivre dans les cas o\u00f9 il y a retard inhabituel et inexcusable risquant de porter s\u00e9rieusement pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, quand l'affaire est demeur\u00e9e au m\u00eame point pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9raisonnable, de sorte que le retard constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal (voir Johnston c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2007 TCDP 42, aux paragraphes 29 \u00e0 34).\n[9] \u00c0 mon avis, les faits en l'esp\u00e8ce ne justifient pas le rejet de la plainte. La p\u00e9riode de 21 mois qui s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9e depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte n'est ni inhabituelle ni d\u00e9raisonnable. Je n'estime pas non plus que le retard est inexcusable. Mme Tourangeau pr\u00e9tend avoir donn\u00e9 ses nouvelles coordonn\u00e9es \u00e0 [traduction] quelqu'un des droits de la personne . \u00c0 ce sujet, Greyhound avance qu'elle a probablement fait cette mise \u00e0 jour apr\u00e8s un d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement ant\u00e9rieur. Greyhound a port\u00e9 \u00e0 mon attention une lettre qu'un conciliateur nomm\u00e9 par la Commission avait envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Greyhound le 24 janvier 2007. Dans cette lettre, le conciliateur a \u00e9crit qu'il n'avait pu effectuer rapidement le [traduction] suivi du dossier parce que Mme Tourangeau avait [traduction] d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment et qu'il lui avait fallu [traduction] quelque temps pour entrer en contact avec elle. Greyhound suppose que, puisque la Commission a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de fournir au Tribunal les coordonn\u00e9es valides de Mme Tourangeau, elle a d\u00fb d\u00e9m\u00e9nager de nouveau plus tard, sans donner sa nouvelle adresse \u00e0 la Commission. C'est bien possible, mais je ne dispose d'aucune preuve montrant que cette omission de mettre la Commission au courant du changement \u00e9tait autre chose qu'une erreur de la part de Mme Tourangeau. Le retard caus\u00e9 par cette erreur n'est pas inexcusable.\n[10] \u00c9galement, je ne tire aucune conclusion d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 Mme Tourangeau \u00e0 partir du fait que la lettre envoy\u00e9e par le Tribunal \u00e0 sa fille a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e marqu\u00e9e de la mention [traduction] non r\u00e9clam\u00e9e , alors que l'avis de requ\u00eate envoy\u00e9 plus tard par Greyhound \u00e0 la m\u00eame adresse a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9. Je note que l'adresse actuelle de Mme Tourangeau se situe \u00e0 des centaines de kilom\u00e8tres de l'adresse de sa fille. Je ne crois pas qu'il convienne de tenir Mme Tourangeau responsable du fait que sa fille n'a pas r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la lettre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente du Tribunal au bureau de poste et ne l'a pas transmise \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re.\n[11] Finalement, je ne suis pas convaincu que les inconv\u00e9nients subis en l'esp\u00e8ce, notamment le fait d'avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 deux conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de gestion d'instance qui se sont finalement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es improductives \u00e0 cause de l'absence de Mme Tourangeau, ont caus\u00e9 un grave pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 Greyhound.\n[12] Pour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate de Greyhound est rejet\u00e9e. Cependant, il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tourangeau d'informer \u00e0 l'avenir le Tribunal de tout changement de coordonn\u00e9es, d\u00e8s qu'il se produit.\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis Date : Le 5 juin 2008 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2008 TCDP 20\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur (i) la demande de l'intim\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lai pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'observations \u00e9crites au sujet des observations finales soit prorog\u00e9 et que l'audition des observations finales soit report\u00e9e \u00e0 septembre 2008 et (ii) la demande de la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e Canadian Association for Free Expression (C.A.F.E.) que les observations finales soient report\u00e9es afin d'appeler au moins sept t\u00e9moins de plus \u00e0 compara\u00eetre tout en se [Traduction] r\u00e9servant le droit d'ajouter d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins.\n[2] La pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission le 24 novembre 2003. La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal le 24 ao\u00fbt 2005. Le 25 novembre 2005, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de question constitutionnelle dans lequel il indiquait son intention de [Traduction] contester l'application constitutionnelle, la validit\u00e9 et l'effet de l'article 13 et des paragraphes 54(1) et 54(1.1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L'intim\u00e9 a propos\u00e9 que la question soit d\u00e9battue dans une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. Le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2005, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Tribunal son avis de requ\u00eate au sujet de la question constitutionnelle en plus de ses observations \u00e9crites et de son cahier de jurisprudence et de doctrine. Le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2005, le Tribunal a avis\u00e9 les parties que la requ\u00eate serait examin\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience en m\u00eame temps que les faits de l'affaire.\n[3] Le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2006, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada a exerc\u00e9 son droit, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'article 57 de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. 1985, ch. F-7, de participer, de produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l'audience et de pr\u00e9senter des observations au sujet de la question constitutionnelle. Entre-temps, un certain nombre de groupes ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de leur accorder le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, y compris la C.A.F.E. Le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2006, le Tribunal a autoris\u00e9 la participation des groupes (Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 8), mais seulement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question constitutionnelle. Leurs arguments ne pouvait pas chevaucher ni r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la preuve, le contre-interrogatoire ou les observations du plaignant, de la Commission, de l'intim\u00e9 ou du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\n[4] Le Tribunal a imparti des d\u00e9lais aux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es et au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, de leurs rapports d'experts et des documents connexes, comme le pr\u00e9voient les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Pendant une conf\u00e9rence de gestion d'instance, qui a eu lieu le 19 mai 2006, toutes les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs pr\u00e9visions quant \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de leurs t\u00e9moignages et les dates auxquelles elles \u00e9taient disponibles. Les dates d'audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es, pour un total de quatre semaines, sur une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9butant le 29 janvier 2007 et se terminant le 2 mars 2007.\n[5] Le 30 mars 2006, l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Commission pour lui demander que les documents portant sur les activit\u00e9s de la Commission au sujet des [Traduction] messages haineux sur Internet, au-del\u00e0 du cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, soient divulgu\u00e9s au motif qu'ils sont possiblement pertinents quant \u00e0 la question constitutionnelle. Dans une lettre ult\u00e9rieure dat\u00e9e du 28 avril 2006, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a soutenu qu'il est [Traduction] \u00e9videmment hautement important \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente contestation que soit examin\u00e9 le fonctionnement de l'article 13 dans le contexte de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et des pouvoirs et mandat g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[6] La Commission a soulev\u00e9 des doutes quant \u00e0 la pertinence de ces documents en soutenant que la question de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'article 13 en est [Traduction] une de droit et que ce qui \u00e9tait demand\u00e9 d\u00e9passait [Traduction] de loin la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, ce qui constitue une recherche \u00e0 l'aveuglette. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada a souscrit \u00e0 cet argument et a ajout\u00e9 que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est le [Traduction] tribunal o\u00f9 il convient de soulever une question constitutionnelle ou toute autre contestation judiciaire visant [Traduction] l'exercice [que fait la Commission] du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'examiner la plainte ou devant lequel il faut traiter toute all\u00e9gation [Traduction] de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 institutionnel ou syst\u00e9mique de la part de la Commission envers les personnes qui d\u00e9fendent certains points de vue.\n[7] Les parties ont donc li\u00e9 contestation \u00e0 propos de la question de divulgation et, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des observations officielles, le Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision le 16 ao\u00fbt 2006 (Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 32) dans laquelle il autorisait en partie la divulgation que l'intim\u00e9 demandait. Le Tribunal a not\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision (aux paragraphes 31 \u00e0 33) que l'intim\u00e9 a soutenu qu'il demandait cette divulgation parce qu'il avait l'intention de faire valoir que les [Traduction] effets pr\u00e9judiciables de l'article 13 de la Loi pourraient \u00eatre si graves que la mesure ne serait pas justifi\u00e9e par les objectifs qu\u2019elle est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 servir, selon le crit\u00e8re de la proportionnalit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103. L'intim\u00e9 a assur\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'il ne demandait pas un examen du caract\u00e8re licite des activit\u00e9s de la Commission, mais plut\u00f4t un examen visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les [Traduction] effets pr\u00e9judiciables que la Loi a sur la libert\u00e9 d'expression surpassent les effets b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques (paragraphe 37).\n[8] Le Tribunal a conclu que toutes les parties avaient soulev\u00e9 des points int\u00e9ressants qui pouvaient \u00eatre correctement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s devant le Tribunal qui statue sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la contestation constitutionnelle et de la plainte dans l'ensemble (Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 32).\n[9] Au cours des mois suivants, un d\u00e9bat a eu lieu entre la Commission et l'intim\u00e9 quant \u00e0 savoir si la divulgation des documents portant sur les activit\u00e9s de la Commission \u00e9tait compl\u00e8te. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une requ\u00eate que l'intim\u00e9 avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet, la Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des affidavits \u00e0 l'appui pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par deux de ses employ\u00e9s, Dean Steacy et Harvey Goldberg. Le 16 janvier 2007, l'intim\u00e9 a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de son intention de contre-interroger MM. Steacy et Goldberg au sujet de ces affidavits. Il a aussi demand\u00e9 que la proc\u00e9dure, qui devait d\u00e9buter deux semaines plus tard, soit ajourn\u00e9e.\n[10] Le 26 janvier 2007, le Tribunal a avis\u00e9 les parties que toutes les questions en instance au sujet de la divulgation et de l'ajournement seraient tranch\u00e9es au d\u00e9but de l'audience du 29 janvier 2007, \u00e0 Toronto. \u00c0 cette premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d'audience, l'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 que des assignations \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 MM. Steacy et Goldberg ainsi qu'\u00e0 Mme Hannya Rizk, une autre employ\u00e9e de la Commission. L'intim\u00e9 a modifi\u00e9 sa liste de t\u00e9moins pour y ajouter ces personnes. Le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 d'envoyer les assignations \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Comme l'audience allait commencer, le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 la suggestion de l'intim\u00e9 que ces trois t\u00e9moins t\u00e9moignent \u00e0 Ottawa, o\u00f9 ils habitent, pendant une audience d'un jour qui serait tenue apr\u00e8s les quatre semaines d'audience d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues.\n[11] Plusieurs semaines plus tard, alors que l'audience avan\u00e7ait, les parties ont mentionn\u00e9 au Tribunal qu'il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de pr\u00e9voir des dates d'audience distinctes pour les observations finales, apr\u00e8s la fin des t\u00e9moignages, afin de permettre aux parties de mieux se pr\u00e9parer et de mieux organiser leurs observations. Trois jours (du 9 au 11 mai 2007) ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9s pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales.\n[12] Les quatre semaines d'audience pr\u00e9vues, \u00e0 Toronto et \u00e0 Mississauga, se sont termin\u00e9es le 1er mars 2007. Les parties ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'y aurait pas d'autre t\u00e9moignage outre que ceux des trois personnes qui devaient t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 Ottawa (M. Steacy, M. Goldberg et Mme Rizk). Au d\u00e9part, une seule journ\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9e pour ces t\u00e9moignages, mais comme Mme Rizk ne pouvait pas se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 cette date, les trois jours qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9s en mai pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 repris pour la pr\u00e9sentation des trois derniers t\u00e9moignages. Mme Rizk a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 le 9 mai 2007 et M. Steacy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 le 10 mai 2007. L'audience du 11 mai a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e parce que l'avocat de la Commission \u00e9tait malade. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Goldberg a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur une p\u00e9riode de trois jours, du 25 au 27 juin 2007, soit les trois nouvelles dates qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales apr\u00e8s que les dates du 9 au 11 mai ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reprises pour les t\u00e9moignages. Ainsi, l\u2019audition des trois t\u00e9moins a donc n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 cinq jours plut\u00f4t que la journ\u00e9e suppl\u00e9mentaire pr\u00e9vue.\n[13] Suite \u00e0 des engagements pris pendant le t\u00e9moignage de M. Goldberg, la Commission a divulgu\u00e9, en juillet 2007, un ensemble de documents qui comptait, semble-t-il, 300 pages au total.\n[14] Au cours des t\u00e9moignages de M. Steacy et de Mme Rizk, la Commission a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre d'objections en vertu de l'article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve du Canada. Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a comp\u00e9tence exclusive pour rendre une d\u00e9cision au sujet de telles objections, les questions au sujet desquelles la Commission a soulev\u00e9 des objections sont demeur\u00e9es sans r\u00e9ponse.\n[15] Le 17 mai 2007, l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour qu'elle rende une d\u00e9cision au sujet des objections pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 37 et, le 5 juillet 2007, il a demand\u00e9 l'ajournement sine die de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, jusqu'au prononc\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le 17 ao\u00fbt 2007, le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 la demande d'ajournement de l'intim\u00e9 (Warman c. Lemire, 2007 TCDP 37). Le Tribunal a not\u00e9 que, si l'une des parties avait mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle avait d'autres preuves \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter, sauf celles li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'objection soulev\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 37, il aurait poursuivi l'audience en attendant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas.\n[16] Le 15 janvier 2008, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu'elle ne pouvait pas examiner [Traduction] en bonne et due forme la demande concernant l'article 37 parce que la Commission avait divulgu\u00e9, quelques semaines plus t\u00f4t, les renseignements au sujet desquels elle avait invoqu\u00e9 l'article 37.\n[17] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a conclu que l'intim\u00e9 pouvait rappeler Mme Rizk et M. Steacy \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et leur demander de r\u00e9pondre aux questions au sujet desquelles la Commission avait soulev\u00e9 des objections, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 toute autre question de suivi directement reli\u00e9es \u00e0 ces r\u00e9ponses. Mme Rizk et M. Steacy ont donc tous les deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 le 25 mars 2008.\n[18] Le 31 mars 2008, l'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d'ordonner \u00e0 la Commission de divulguer des documents et des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires. La Commission a r\u00e9pondu le 10 avril 2008 qu'elle ne s'opposait pas \u00e0 l'ordonnance que l'intim\u00e9 demandait. Cependant, elle a not\u00e9 que les dossiers vis\u00e9s par la demande [Traduction] seraient peu, ou pas, pertinents.\n[19] La Commission a envoy\u00e9 une partie des documents \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et aux autres parties le 25 avril 2008 et leur a envoy\u00e9 le reste des dix pages suppl\u00e9mentaires le 1er mai 2008. La Commission avait expurg\u00e9 certains renseignements de ces documents, y compris le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es de certaines personnes. Le 5 mai 2008, l'intim\u00e9 a contest\u00e9 ces expurgations et a demand\u00e9 une divulgation compl\u00e8te des documents originaux. Le Tribunal tranchera cette question dans une d\u00e9cision distincte. L'intim\u00e9 a aussi demand\u00e9 le report des observations finales, dont les dates avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9es aux 11, 12 et 13 juin 2008, afin de lui permettre d'obtenir les documents originaux et de pr\u00e9senter une demande pour ajouter ces documents comme \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans l'affaire.\n[20] Le 12 mai 2008, le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 de reporter les dates. Il a demand\u00e9 aux parties de lui faire part de leur disponibilit\u00e9 dans les semaines du 7 et du 14 juillet 2008, pour qu'elles pr\u00e9sentent leurs observations finales. Le Tribunal a aussi permis \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser en preuve tous les documents r\u00e9cemment divulgu\u00e9s en les pr\u00e9sentant au Greffe du Tribunal dans une reliure.\n[21] L'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait apparemment pas satisfait de la prorogation du d\u00e9lai. Le 13 mai 2008, l'intim\u00e9 a de nouveau \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour lui demander une nouvelle prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations \u00e9crites en ao\u00fbt 2008 et le report de l'audition des observations finales en septembre 2008. Son avocate a mentionn\u00e9 que l'affaire comportait [Traduction] des milliers de pages d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de transcriptions et qu'elle aurait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 respecter le d\u00e9lai. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle travaillait seule alors que certaines des autres parties avaient l'avantage d'avoir plus d'un avocat qui s'occupait de l'affaire.\n[22] La partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e C.A.F.E. a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses propres demandes, en parall\u00e8le avec les demandes de prorogation de l'intim\u00e9. Le 5 mai 2008, la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e C.A.F.E. a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle appuyait la demande de l'intim\u00e9 pour la [Traduction] suspension des d\u00e9lais au moins jusqu'\u00e0 l'automne et elle a demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9ouverture de l'audience pour de nouveaux t\u00e9moignages qui d\u00e9coulaient [traduction] du contenu des divulgations de derni\u00e8re minute ou qui pourraient \u00eatre r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par les versions non expurg\u00e9es des divulgations que l'intim\u00e9 demandait.\n[23] Le 13 mai 2008, la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e C.A.F.E. a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa propre requ\u00eate officielle pour [Traduction] reporter les dates des observations finales et appeler d'autres t\u00e9moins. La partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e C.A.F.E. a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en pr\u00e9sentation [Traduction] d'une all\u00e9gation de crainte de partialit\u00e9 d'un membre du Tribunal en l'esp\u00e8ce. Cette requ\u00eate sera tranch\u00e9e dans une d\u00e9cision distincte.\n[24] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e C.A.F.E. d\u00e9clare qu'elle propose d'appeler au moins sept t\u00e9moins, y compris M. Steacy et M. Goldberg. Elle se [Traduction] r\u00e9serve aussi le droit d'ajouter d'autres t\u00e9moins. Elle soutient que sa requ\u00eate est motiv\u00e9e par [Traduction] la divulgation tr\u00e8s tardive et incompl\u00e8te de la Commission. La partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e C.A.F.E. soutient aussi que M. Steacy a fait preuve d'une [Traduction] obstruction ridicule parce que sa vision est mauvaise et qu'il n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son assistant de l'accompagner lorsqu'il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 le 25 mars 2008, obligeant donc l'avocat \u00e0 lui lire des documents. Il faut se demander, cependant, comment la pr\u00e9sence de l'assistant, lisant les documents \u00e0 M. Steacy, aurait acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9 le d\u00e9roulement de l'audience.\n[25] La divulgation cens\u00e9ment tardive et incompl\u00e8te est compos\u00e9e des documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en juillet 2007, apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de M. Goldberg, et des documents que la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en avril et en mai 2008, apr\u00e8s r\u00e9ception de la lettre de l'intim\u00e9 du 31 mars 2008.\nAnalyse [26] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal il y a pr\u00e8s de trois ans. Le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Les tribunaux des droits de la personne, ainsi que d'autres tribunaux, ont le devoir de garantir le r\u00e8glement diligent des plaintes, devoir que la Cour d'appel de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a soulign\u00e9 dans l'affaire Nova Scotia Construction Safety Association c. Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, 2006 NSCA 63, aux paragraphes 76 et 77 :\n[Traduction]\n[76] Compte tenu du principe bien connu selon lequel un des principaux objectifs de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne est d'offrir un redressement, le processus d'instruction et d'exposition d'actes de discrimination doit \u00eatre exp\u00e9ditif afin d'\u00eatre efficace. Sans quoi, les effets b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques d'un examen public, soient les r\u00e9v\u00e9lations et le redressement appropri\u00e9 par rapport aux violations prouv\u00e9es, seront perdus. Le r\u00e8glement efficace et rapide des plaintes est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des plaignants et des personnes dont le comportement est contest\u00e9. Il en va ainsi de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Les personnes et les entreprises doivent pouvoir continuer leur vie. Contrairement au bon vin, une proc\u00e9dure prolong\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ne s\u2019am\u00e9liore pas avec l\u2019\u00e2ge.\n[77] \u00c0 ce sujet, les observations du juge LeBel, inscrites dans des motifs dissidents dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Blencoe c. Colombie-Britannique (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44, sont particuli\u00e8rement pertinentes :\n140 Ce n\u2019est pas d\u2019hier que les d\u00e9lais inutiles dans les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires et les proc\u00e9dures administratives sont qualifi\u00e9s de contraires \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et \u00e9quitable. Il s\u2019agit jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un certain point d\u2019un fl\u00e9au qui touche presque tous les tribunaux judiciaires et les tribunaux administratifs. C\u2019est un probl\u00e8me qu\u2019il faut r\u00e9gler pour assurer le maintien d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de justice efficace et digne de la confiance des Canadiens et des Canadiennes. [...]\n[27] R\u00e9cemment, dans une affaire portant sur le contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, Postes Canada c. A.F.P.C., 2008 CF 223, aux paragraphes 264 et 265, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a formul\u00e9 des observations semblables. Elle a not\u00e9 qu\u2019une audience sans discipline ni \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers retarde la justice et constitue un d\u00e9ni de justice. La Cour a ensuite r\u00e9cit\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle bien connue justice diff\u00e9r\u00e9e est justice refus\u00e9e et a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019une audience \u00e9quitable n\u2019est pas un processus permanent. Une audience \u00e9quitable en est une o\u00f9 une partie sait ce qu\u2019on lui reproche et a l\u2019occasion d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, auquel moment le Tribunal a l\u2019obligation de trancher l\u2019affaire.\n[28] Ces observations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es par les cours sont refl\u00e9t\u00e9es dans la Note de pratique no 1 du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, Tenue des audiences et diffusion des d\u00e9cisions en temps opportun, qui se trouve sur le site Web du Tribunal : http:\/\/www.chrt\u2011tcdp.gc.ca\/about\/tribunalrules_f.asp. La Note de pratique se termine en rappelant \u00e0 tous les participants aux instructions du TCDP leur obligation de contribuer \u00e0 la conclusion en temps opportun du processus d\u2019audience et de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, et l\u2019engagement du Tribunal \u00e0 respecter la directive du Parlement dans le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi.\n[29] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il existe une autre raison imp\u00e9rieuse d\u2019agir rapidement. Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 dans ses observations, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est pr\u00e9sentement saisie d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, dont la proc\u00e9dure est suspendue depuis le 2 avril 2007 en attendant le r\u00e8glement de l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (Kulbashian c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), 2007 CF 354). La Cour a expliqu\u00e9 que le r\u00e9sultat de la pr\u00e9sente audience et de toute demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire ult\u00e9rieure lui servira de guide pour trancher l\u2019affaire Kulbashian. Je sais aussi qu\u2019au moins une autre affaire portant sur l\u2019article 13 est pr\u00e9sentement en instance devant le Tribunal et la portion de l\u2019audience portant sur une question constitutionnelle semblable a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e en attendant le r\u00e8glement de l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, plus le temps passe avant le r\u00e8glement de l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, plus longtemps ces affaires \u2013 et possiblement d\u2019autres \u00e0 venir \u2013 resteront en instance.\n[30] Les parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, ont confirm\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019elles n\u2019avaient pas l\u2019intention d\u2019appeler d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages des trois employ\u00e9s de la Commission, qui se seraient termin\u00e9s le 27 juin 2007 apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de M. Goldberg, si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait les objections fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 37 et la demande cons\u00e9cutive pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[31] La partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e C.A.F.E. soutient que les t\u00e9moins devraient \u00eatre rappel\u00e9s et que de nouveaux t\u00e9moins devraient compara\u00eetre en raison de la divulgation [Traduction] tardive de documents \u00e0 la suite du t\u00e9moignage de M. Goldberg. Cependant, la C.A.F.E. a ces documents en sa possession depuis juillet 2007. Avant les derni\u00e8res semaines, aucune demande n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour de nouveaux t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 ce sujet. Le Tribunal a re\u00e7u une demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour que ces documents soient inscrits imm\u00e9diatement au dossier, sans que des t\u00e9moins ne soient appel\u00e9s, et le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 cette demande. La communication de ces documents de la Commission en juillet 2007 ne justifie donc pas le rappel de t\u00e9moins et l\u2019appel de nouveaux t\u00e9moins \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape.\n[32] En ce qui a trait aux documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en avril et en mai 2008, le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 qu\u2019ils soient inscrits comme \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. De fa\u00e7on plus importante, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 tous ces documents et les documents parlent d\u2019eux-m\u00eames, tout simplement. Une partie de ces documents est constitu\u00e9e de courriels envoy\u00e9s par M. Steacy sous un faux nom, qui sont semblables \u00e0 ceux au sujet desquels il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Les autres documents restants, qui constituent la majeure partie des documents en question, d\u00e9montrent que la Commission coop\u00e8re avec plusieurs groupes collectifs et avec les services policiers pour des questions portant sur l\u2019article 13. Ce sont essentiellement les faits que l\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue dans son expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2006, au paragraphe 75, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses arguments sur la question constitutionnelle :\n[Traduction]\nLa Commission elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9clare que le processus de plainte n\u2019est qu\u2019une partie de ce qu\u2019elle appelle le combat plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral contre les activit\u00e9s inspir\u00e9es par la haine au Canada. Elle travaille avec des FAI, des ONG, les policiers et des minist\u00e8res gouvernementaux de fa\u00e7on extrajudiciaire pour bloquer les points de vue qui, \u00e0 son avis, propagent la haine. La loi lui donne le pouvoir d\u2019entreprendre cette destruction de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression derri\u00e8re des portes closes, dans des r\u00e9unions priv\u00e9es et avec des groupes et organismes qu\u2019elle favorise. La Commission travaille en \u00e9troite collaboration avec les unit\u00e9s sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re de crimes motiv\u00e9s par la haine des services de police d\u2019Edmonton (Alberta) et de London (Ontario), entre autres, afin de saisir des ordinateurs et des preuves dans le cadre de descentes de police dans les r\u00e9sidences des personnes contre qui M. Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes. Ces preuves sont ensuite utilis\u00e9es lors d\u2019audiences devant le Tribunal. L\u2019article 13 sert de disposition criminelle de fait, en permettant l\u2019utilisation du pouvoir policier en mati\u00e8re de fouilles et de saisies afin d\u2019obtenir des preuves. La plupart de ces personnes ne sont pas, par la suite, accus\u00e9es en vertu du Code criminel.\nDe plus, de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments prouvant la coop\u00e9ration entre la Commission et les services de police, ainsi qu\u2019avec la collectivit\u00e9, avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors d\u2019audiences pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Je ne vois pas pourquoi cette preuve doit \u00eatre r\u00e9examin\u00e9e. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l\u2019a not\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Malmo-Levine; R. c. Caine, 2003 CSC 74, au paragraphe 27, un juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas \u00e0 examiner des preuves r\u00e9p\u00e9titives qui ne font pas avancer le travail de la Cour.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, il reste donc \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si, d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019activit\u00e9 contest\u00e9e de la Commission prouve que les [Traduction] effets pr\u00e9judiciables de l\u2019article 13 envers la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression sont si graves qu\u2019ils d\u00e9passent les effets b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 et certaines des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es l\u2019affirment, ou si, de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, la preuve d\u2019une telle activit\u00e9 n\u2019a aucun effet sur l\u2019analyse de la proportionnalit\u00e9 qui doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 1 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, comme la Commission, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le plaignant et les autres parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es le font valoir. Cette question sera trait\u00e9e dans les observations finales, comme je l\u2019ai r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 pendant l\u2019affaire, chaque fois que j\u2019ai conclu, malgr\u00e9 les objections soutenues de la Commission et du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, que ce type de preuve pouvait \u00eatre accept\u00e9.\n[34] La requ\u00eate de la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e C.A.F.E. en rappel des t\u00e9moins et en appel de t\u00e9moins suppl\u00e9mentaires est donc rejet\u00e9e.\n[35] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en prorogation du d\u00e9lai, en plus de celui qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t ce mois-ci, le Tribunal tient \u00e9videmment compte de l\u2019importante quantit\u00e9 de lettres, de requ\u00eates, d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et d\u2019autres documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, particuli\u00e8rement au cours des derni\u00e8res semaines. Le Tribunal est aussi conscient que les dates d\u2019audience en juillet qu\u2019il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9es aux parties en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en prorogation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisies sans que les parties n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9es au sujet de leurs disponibilit\u00e9s personnelles, pour trois jours cons\u00e9cutifs, au cours des semaines de juillet pendant lesquelles le Tribunal peut si\u00e9ger. Ce qui compte le plus pour le Tribunal \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape est de garantir que les parties et leurs avocats sont enti\u00e8rement pr\u00eats \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal tous leurs arguments au sujet de toutes les questions importantes de fait et de droit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Compte tenu des circonstances, mais tout en respectant l\u2019exigence d\u2019un processus exp\u00e9ditif mais juste, je ne vois pas de mal \u00e0 accorder une prorogation de quelques semaines suppl\u00e9mentaires, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 garantir que toutes les parties seront tout \u00e0 fait pr\u00eates et disponibles pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales.\n[36] Par cons\u00e9quent, les \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers des observations \u00e9crites peuvent aussi \u00eatre report\u00e9s. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019oppose au fait que les autres parties auront plus de temps pour pr\u00e9parer leurs observations finales. Il soutient qu\u2019il y aurait injustice puisqu\u2019elles ont eu la chance de lire ses observations finales, qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es le 9 mai 2008, comme l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier le pr\u00e9voyait. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne vois pas de pr\u00e9judice. L\u2019objet de l\u2019exercice est de pr\u00e9senter des documents au Tribunal pour qu\u2019il puisse mieux comprendre les positions des parties, particuli\u00e8rement parce qu\u2019ils sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pendant les plaidoiries. Si le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral croit qu\u2019il est important qu\u2019il compl\u00e8te ses observations en r\u00e9ponse aux d\u00e9p\u00f4ts ult\u00e9rieurs des observations des autres parties, il pourra le faire conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier suivant :\nLe plaignant et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne pr\u00e9senteront leurs observations sur le bien-fond\u00e9 au plus tard le 6 ao\u00fbt 2008;\nLe plaignant, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9senteront leurs observations sur la question constitutionnelle au plus tard le 6 ao\u00fbt 2008;\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sentera ses observations sur le bien-fond\u00e9 au plus tard le 22 ao\u00fbt 2008;\nEn ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question constitutionnelle, les observations en r\u00e9ponse des parties principales (ce qui comprend bien entendu le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, ce qui fait suite au commentaire que j\u2019ai fait plus haut) et les observations principales des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es devront \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au plus tard le 22 ao\u00fbt 2008.\n[37] Les parties doivent communiquer au greffe du Tribunal leurs dates de disponibilit\u00e9 dans la semaine du 8 ou du 15 septembre 2008, pour la tenue d\u2019une audience dans le secteur ouest de la r\u00e9gion du grand Toronto.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthania Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 5 juin 2008\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1073\/5405\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Richard Warman c.

Jensen\n2008 TCDP 2008\/12\/18\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR :\n[1] Le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2007, le Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision dans laquelle il a conclu que les intim\u00e9s avaient commis un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 l'endroit des plaignants en les traitant diff\u00e9remment du groupe, compos\u00e9 majoritairement d'hommes, des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux travaillant pour le programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC, qui effectuaient un travail sensiblement \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 celui des plaignants. En particulier, le Tribunal a conclu que le refus des intim\u00e9s, depuis mars 1978, de reconna\u00eetre la nature professionnelle du travail effectu\u00e9 par les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux proportionnellement \u00e0 la reconnaissance professionnelle accord\u00e9e au travail des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9tait discriminatoire. \u00c0 la demande des parties, le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 d'ordonner une mesure de redressement pour l'acte discriminatoire. Il a accord\u00e9 du temps aux parties pour n\u00e9gocier une mesure de redressement, faute de quoi le Tribunal rendrait une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive apr\u00e8s avoir fourni aux parties l'occasion de pr\u00e9senter une preuve si n\u00e9cessaire ainsi que des observations. Les parties ne sont pas parvenues \u00e0 une entente. Par cons\u00e9quent, une audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue pour la semaine du 28 juillet au 1er ao\u00fbt 2008.\n[2] Les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant l'autorisation de produire une preuve concernant les mesures de redressement qu'ils proposent pour mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire. Ils voudraient \u00e9galement produire une preuve sur la question de savoir si l'acte discriminatoire a entra\u00een\u00e9 des pertes de salaire pour les plaignants et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, comment calculer ces pertes.\nLa preuve concernant les mesures de redressement propos\u00e9es pour mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire\n[3] \u00c0 titre de mesure de redressement visant \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire \u00e9tabli dans la d\u00e9cision du 13 d\u00e9cembre 2007 rendue par le Tribunal, les intim\u00e9s proposent qu'une nouvelle classification de Sciences infirmi\u00e8res (NU) soit cr\u00e9\u00e9e au sein du groupe Services de sant\u00e9 (SH), lequel inclurait les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux. Il existe \u00e0 l'heure actuelle deux sous-groupes au sein de la classification NU : les infirmiers d'h\u00f4pital (HOC) et les infirmiers en sant\u00e9 communautaire (CHN). Selon la proposition, un troisi\u00e8me sous-groupe serait ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la classification NU.\n[4] Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que le Tribunal doit entendre les explications de Patricia Power, conseill\u00e8re principale du vice-pr\u00e9sident du secteur Infrastructure strat\u00e9gique, organisation et classification, Agence de la fonction publique du Canada, et de Charles Tardiff, coordonnateur de projet et chercheur principal, Division de l'analyse des d\u00e9penses et de la planification de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, pour comprendre pourquoi la meilleure fa\u00e7on de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire est de cr\u00e9er un troisi\u00e8me sous-groupe NU pour les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux.\n[5] Tant les avocats de certains des plaignants et que ceux de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne sont en d\u00e9saccord avec la position des intim\u00e9s. Ils soutiennent que la cr\u00e9ation d'une nouvelle cat\u00e9gorie dans le groupe NU n'est pas la solution qui convient. Les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux devraient plut\u00f4t faire partie de la m\u00eame norme de classification, bien qu'ils puissent \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9s par diff\u00e9rents niveaux au sein de cette classification. Les deux parties soutiennent que cette mesure de redressement se trouve implicitement dans la d\u00e9cision rendue le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2007 par le Tribunal. Ils soutiennent qu'il ne faut rien de plus qu'une ordonnance du Tribunal obligeant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'une nouvelle norme de classification qui engloberait tant le travail des \u00e9valuateurs que celui des conseillers. Le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor devra ensuite exercer son pouvoir exclusif de classifier les postes au sein de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour cr\u00e9er cette norme de classification. Selon les plaignants et la Commission, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de produire d'autres preuves \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[6] Je conviens avec les intim\u00e9s qu'ils devraient \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 produire une preuve concernant les mesures de redressement qu'ils proposent pour mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire. Au paragraphe 138 de la d\u00e9cision rendue en d\u00e9cembre 2007, j'ai fourni des exemples de mesures que le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor aurait pu prendre pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es au fil des ans par les \u00e9valuateurs au sujet de la classification de leur poste. Cependant, les exemples contenus dans ce paragraphe n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 titre de mesures possibles de redressement visant \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire auquel la d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9cembre 2007 avait conclu. En effet, j'ai laiss\u00e9 les parties libres de n\u00e9gocier une solution, mais, si elles n'y parvenaient pas, le Tribunal rendrait une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive apr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 aux parties la chance de produire une preuve additionnelle (au besoin) et de formuler des observations.\n[7] Les intim\u00e9s ont propos\u00e9 les mesures de redressement qu'ils jugent les plus appropri\u00e9es dans les circonstances. Mme Power et M. Tardiff t\u00e9moigneront \u00e0 l'appui de ces mesures propos\u00e9es. Les plaignants sont libres de contester la preuve et les mesures propos\u00e9es de m\u00eame que de soutenir que leur position vaut mieux que celle des intim\u00e9s. Les plaignants sont tout \u00e0 fait libres de produire eux-m\u00eames la preuve qu'ils jugent indiqu\u00e9e. Cependant, il serait tout \u00e0 fait injuste que le Tribunal prive les intim\u00e9s de la chance de produire une preuve et de formuler des observations au sujet de leur proposition, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9cembre 2007 ne fournissait aucune indication quant aux mesures de redressement appropri\u00e9es et laissait bel et bien ouverte la possibilit\u00e9 de produire une preuve et des arguments \u00e0 ce sujet.\nLa preuve concernant l'existence de pertes de salaire r\u00e9sultant de l'acte discriminatoire et leur indemnisation\n[8] Afin de calculer l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire qui pourraient avoir r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire des intim\u00e9s, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des \u00e9valuateurs doit \u00eatre compar\u00e9e \u00e0 celle d'un groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9. Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 est le poste NU-CHN-02 ou NU-CHN-03, et non le groupe des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, auquel le Tribunal a compar\u00e9 le travail des \u00e9valuateurs dans la d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9cembre 2007. Ils fondent cette affirmation sur le fait que, dans la d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9cembre 2007, le Tribunal a conclu que le travail des \u00e9valuateurs et des conseillers \u00e9tait suffisamment diff\u00e9rent pour justifier un niveau de classification diff\u00e9rent ainsi qu'un salaire et des avantages diff\u00e9rents. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon les intim\u00e9s, le poste de conseiller m\u00e9dical ne constitue pas un point de comparaison appropri\u00e9. Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que leur position est \u00e9galement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal de changer le cours de l'audience et par le fait que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux essayaient, jusqu'\u00e0 tout r\u00e9cemment, de se faire reconna\u00eetre en tant qu'infirmiers.\n[9] \u00c0 mon avis, il est aussi justifi\u00e9 que n\u00e9cessaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une comparaison de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et du travail des conseillers et des \u00e9valuateurs afin de d\u00e9terminer si l'acte discriminatoire a entra\u00een\u00e9 une perte de salaire. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction, des pertes de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire. L'acte discriminatoire constat\u00e9 par le Tribunal dans sa d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9cembre 2007 n'\u00e9tait pas le refus des intim\u00e9s de classifier les \u00e9valuateurs en tant qu'infirmiers. Le Tribunal a plut\u00f4t conclu que les intim\u00e9s ont commis un acte discriminatoire en traitant les \u00e9valuateurs et les conseillers comme s'ils effectuaient un travail diff\u00e9rent alors qu'ils effectuaient un travail sensiblement \u00e9quivalent et en les classant en cons\u00e9quence (Walden et al. c. D\u00e9veloppement social Canada et al., 2007 TCDP 56, aux paragraphes 11, 95 et 143). La mesure de redressement doit d\u00e9couler du traitement diff\u00e9rent qu'ont subi les \u00e9valuateurs par rapport aux conseillers. Pour ce faire, il faut comparer la valeur du travail effectu\u00e9 par les \u00e9valuateurs par rapport \u00e0 celui des conseillers.\n[10] Cependant, d\u00e9terminer la valeur du travail effectu\u00e9 par les \u00e9valuateurs par rapport aux conseillers n'emp\u00eache pas de comparer la valeur du travail des \u00e9valuateurs \u00e0 celle du travail effectu\u00e9 dans d'autres postes comme les postes NU-CHN-02 et NU-CHN-03. Il se peut que la comparaison entre les \u00e9valuateurs et les conseillers r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la valeur du travail des \u00e9valuateurs est \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 celle du travail aux postes NU-CHN-02 ou NU-CHN-03. Dans ce cas, les intim\u00e9s pourraient soutenir que les pertes de salaire des \u00e9valuateurs devraient \u00eatre \u00e9tablies \u00e0 partir d'une comparaison avec le salaire des employ\u00e9s aux postes CHN au moment pertinent. Les plaignants et la Commission sont de toute \u00e9vidence libres de produire une preuve diff\u00e9rente et de soutenir que les pertes de salaire doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9es diff\u00e9remment.\n[11] La t\u00e2che du Tribunal serait facilit\u00e9e s'il entendait le t\u00e9moignage d'un expert en \u00e9valuation des postes au sujet des divers moyens d'\u00e9tablir la valeur du travail des \u00e9valuateurs par rapport \u00e0 celle du travail des conseillers. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal accueille la requ\u00eate des intim\u00e9s visant \u00e0 rouvrir l'audience pour produire la preuve d'un expert en \u00e9valuation des postes, \u00e9tant entendu qu'il faut se pencher sur la question de savoir s'il convient d'utiliser le poste de conseiller m\u00e9dical \u00e0 titre de groupe de comparaison.\nLe pr\u00e9judice moral\n[12] Dans sa d\u00e9cision rendue en d\u00e9cembre 2007, le Tribunal a conclu que les plaignants devraient \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9s dans une certaine mesure en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'ils ont subi \u00e0 la suite de l'acte discriminatoire. Le Tribunal a laiss\u00e9 les parties n\u00e9gocier le montant de cette indemnit\u00e9 et s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de le d\u00e9terminer lui-m\u00eame si les parties ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 une entente. Les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de s'accorder sur le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, cette question sera tranch\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de l'audience sur les mesures de redressement.\n[13] Le Tribunal convient avec les parties qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de produire des preuves additionnelles \u00e0 ce sujet. Cependant, pour faciliter l'\u00e9tablissement du montant, il serait utile de disposer d'une liste compl\u00e8te des plaignants (tant ceux qui sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un avocat que ceux qui ne le sont pas) avec la date du d\u00e9but et de la fin (au cas o\u00f9 ils n'y travailleraient plus) de leur emploi du programme des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC.\nKaren A.

Hadjis Date : Le 9 juin 2008 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2008 TCDP 22\n[1] Le 16 mai 2008, la British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) a sollicit\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation d\u2019intervenir [traduction] dans la question concernant la contestation constitutionnelle des articles 13 et 54 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne devant le Tribunal. Elle tente d\u2019obtenir l\u2019autorisation de d\u00e9poser un argument \u00e9crit, d\u2019introduire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, de recevoir les arguments et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par toutes les autres parties \u2013 et d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre \u2013 ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation appropri\u00e9e des articles 13 et 54, de contre\u2011interroger les t\u00e9moins et de pr\u00e9senter oralement ses arguments. La BCCLA ne pr\u00e9voit pas appeler de t\u00e9moins, mais elle demande \u00e0 pouvoir pr\u00e9senter une demande en ce sens plus tard.\n[2] La Commission, le plaignant et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada se sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 la demande de la BCCLA.\n[3] Comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente du Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qui traitait d\u2019une demande semblable de la part de la Canadian Constitutional Foundation (CCF) (Warman c. Lemire, 2008 TCDP 7) [sic], le Tribunal a un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour ce qui est d\u2019accorder le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Cependant, tout comme la CCF, la BCCLA a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande tr\u00e8s tard durant l\u2019audience. Les dates des derni\u00e8res plaidoiries approchent, apr\u00e8s cinq semaines de pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve. Les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce diff\u00e8rent toutefois grandement de celles dont \u00e9tait saisi le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, qui a r\u00e9cemment accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la BCCLA le statut d\u2019intervenante avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience (Elmasry c. Roger\u2019s Publishing Ltd., 2008 BCHRT 199).\n[4] La BCCLA affirme qu\u2019elle a eu l\u2019intention de solliciter le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire d\u00e8s 2006, mais qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de se trouver un avocat pour la repr\u00e9senter. Ce qui est tout \u00e0 fait possible, mais il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que sa demande a en fait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue en mai 2008. Les questions et pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par le Tribunal dans sa d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure rejetant la demande de la CCF d\u2019intervenir aussi tardivement s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement \u00e0 la BCCLA.\n[5] De plus, comme l\u2019a dit le Tribunal dans cette d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache la BCCLA de communiquer tout argument particulier qu\u2019elle estime applicable \u00e0 la question constitutionnelle aux parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui contestent la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des articles 13 et 54.\n[6] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de la British Columbia Civil Liberties Association est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthania Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 9 juin 2008\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1073\/5405\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Richard Warman c.

Jensen\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] Nanette Hunt a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre son ancien employeur, Transport One Ltd., dans laquelle elle all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e sexuellement par Harry Wadhwa, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Transport One Ltd., et par Wayne Dibbley, un r\u00e9partiteur chez Transport One Ltd.\n[2] Personne n'a comparu \u00e0 l'audience au nom de l'intim\u00e9e, Transport One Ltd. En outre, l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas particip\u00e9 aux conf\u00e9rences pr\u00e9paratoires qui ont eu lieu avant l'audience. Le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 de nombreuses lettres par messager et par la poste \u00e0 deux adresses \u00e0 Windsor, en Ontario, informant M. Wadhwa de la tenue des conf\u00e9rences pr\u00e9paratoires et de l'audience dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[3] Malgr\u00e9 les efforts du Tribunal visant \u00e0 inviter un repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence de gestion d'instance et \u00e0 l'instruction, l'intim\u00e9e a choisi de ne pas r\u00e9pondre au Tribunal, de ne pas se pr\u00e9senter aux conf\u00e9rences de gestion d'instance et de ne pas compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience.\n[4] Le paragraphe 9(8) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'audition d'une plainte m\u00eame si une partie ne se pr\u00e9sente pas devant lui, s'il est persuad\u00e9 que ladite partie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment avis\u00e9e de la tenue de l'audience. Bien que les R\u00e8gles ne puissent accro\u00eetre le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal par la loi, elles servent bel et bien d'avertissement aux parties quant aux mesures que peut prendre le Tribunal dans le cadre de l'instruction d'une plainte.\n[5] Le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu que l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment avis\u00e9e de la tenue de l'audience et, par cons\u00e9quent, qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9quitable de tenir l'audience en l'absence de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[6] \u00c0 l'audience, Mme Hunt a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des incidents qui ont men\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte le 19 septembre 2005. Bien qu'elle n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9e puisque l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas comparu \u00e0 l'audience, j'ai trouv\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Hunt direct, sinc\u00e8re et coh\u00e9rent; j'ai trouv\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible. Il n'y a pas eu d'autres t\u00e9moins.\n[7] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience.\n[8] Mme Hunt a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, le 14 juillet 2005, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par M. Harry Wadhwa en tant que directrice de bureau pour une nouvelle entreprise de courtage dans le domaine du transport du nom de Transport One Ltd., situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Windsor, en Ontario. Mme Hunt a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler le 25 juillet 2005. Au d\u00e9but, les seules personnes qui travaillaient chez Transport One Ltd. \u00e9taient Mme Hunt et M. Wadhwa. Cependant, peu apr\u00e8s son embauche, M. Wadhwa a engag\u00e9 M. Wayne Dibbley en tant que r\u00e9partiteur. Par la suite, M. Wadhwa a embauch\u00e9 M. Mike Bronson \u00e0 titre de directeur des ventes de Transport One Ltd.\n[9] Mme Hunt, M. Wadhwa, M. Dibbley et, par la suite, M. Bronson, travaillaient tous dans une roulotte de 40 pieds. Le rapport juridique entre Harry Wadhwa et l'intim\u00e9e Transport One Ltd. n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli clairement. \u00c0 l'audience, Mme Hunt a produit une preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9lant que les parents de M. Wadhwa \u00e9taient propri\u00e9taires du terrain o\u00f9 \u00e9tait stationn\u00e9e la roulotte. Mme Hunt \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Wadhwa partageait le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'entreprise avec ses parents. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que M. Wadhwa dirigeait les activit\u00e9s, et que ses parents ne participaient pas \u00e0 l'exploitation quotidienne de l'entreprise. Compte tenu de cette preuve, je conclus que, \u00e0 tout le moins, M. Wadhwa a agi \u00e0 titre d'agent de l'entreprise intim\u00e9e dans l'embauche d'employ\u00e9s et a dirig\u00e9 les activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de Transport One Ltd.\n[10] Le bureau de Mme Hunt \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 est de la roulotte-bureau de Transport One Ltd. Son ordinateur \u00e9tait le seul qui avait un acc\u00e8s Internet. En cons\u00e9quence, M. Wadhwa et M. Dibbley se penchaient souvent par-dessus son \u00e9paule pour voir l'\u00e9cran ou demandaient \u00e0 Mme Hunt de laisser sa chaise pour qu'ils puissent utiliser son ordinateur pour avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet.\n[11] Le 18 ao\u00fbt 2005, M. Dibbley et Mme Hunt travaillaient seuls dans la roulotte-bureau de Transport One Ltd. M. Dibbley a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 formuler des commentaires de nature sexuelle \u00e0 propos de l'apparence physique de Mme Hunt, disant entre autres choses qu'elle \u00e9tait belle quand elle portait des jeans et qu'il aimait quand elle se penchait sur son bureau. Mme Hunt n'a pas r\u00e9agi aux commentaires et a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire son travail, en esp\u00e9rant que M. Dibbley s'arr\u00eate.\n[12] Le 18 ao\u00fbt, Mme Hunt portait un t-shirt sous un blouson. La fermeture \u00e9clair du blouson \u00e9tait baiss\u00e9e aux trois quarts. Apr\u00e8s avoir formul\u00e9 les commentaires cit\u00e9s ci-dessus, M. Dibbley s'est approch\u00e9 de Mme Hunt par derri\u00e8re et a pass\u00e9 le bras autour d'elle. Il a saisi la fermeture \u00e9clair de son blouson et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 la tirer vers le haut, ce faisant, il a frott\u00e9 ses seins. Sur un ton f\u00e2ch\u00e9, Mme Hunt lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu'il faisait. M. Dibbley lui a r\u00e9pondu que sa poitrine le [traduction] d\u00e9rangeait. Il s'est ensuite dirig\u00e9 vers la porte de la roulotte, l'a ouverte et s'est tenu dans le cadre en d\u00e9visageant Mme Hunt. M. Dibbley a dit \u00e0 Mme Hunt qu'il avait besoin d'air frais [traduction] pour calmer ce qui se passait dans son pantalon. Apr\u00e8s, il a quitt\u00e9 la roulotte quelques minutes.\n[13] Quand il est revenu dans la roulotte plus tard ce m\u00eame matin du 18 ao\u00fbt 2005, M. Dibbley s'est encore approch\u00e9 de Mme Hunt et lui a dit d'ouvrir sa fermeture \u00e9clair en disant que [traduction] la vue \u00e9tait plus belle comme \u00e7a. Il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 fixer sa poitrine du regard et \u00e0 passer des remarques \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel. Mme Hunt a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle \u00e9tait visiblement boulevers\u00e9e; elle pleurait et elle faisait la t\u00eate. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle se sentait malade et sur le point de vomir au travail. Elle \u00e9tait outr\u00e9e de la conduite de M. Dibbley.\n[14] Dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi du 18 ao\u00fbt, M. Wadhwa a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Hunt au bureau et lui a demand\u00e9 de se rendre en voiture jusque chez lui et de l'amener au travail. Mme Hunt a obtemp\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, \u00e0 son retour au bureau avec M. Wadhwa, elle \u00e9tait encore tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9e des incidents du matin; elle pleurait et elle faisait la t\u00eate. \u00c0 un certain moment au cours de l'apr\u00e8s-midi du 18 ao\u00fbt, Mme Hunt est sortie de la roulotte parce qu'elle \u00e9tait dans tous ses \u00e9tats. Pendant qu'elle se tenait \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la roulotte et qu'elle pleurait, M. Wadhwa s'est approch\u00e9 d'elle. Il lui a pass\u00e9 le bras autour des \u00e9paules et a dit \u00e0 Mme Hunt que [traduction] tout ce dont elle avait besoin, c'\u00e9tait d'un homme bon pour lui faire sa f\u00eate.\n[15] Mme Hunt n'a pas parl\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage de sa r\u00e9action \u00e0 l'\u00e9treinte et aux commentaires de M. Wadhwa. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience et, parfois, il \u00e9tait clair qu'elle \u00e9prouvait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 raconter au Tribunal, sans aide, ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. \u00c9galement, \u00e0 mon avis, il \u00e9tait apparent que Mme Hunt ne croyait pas qu'elle devait donner tous les d\u00e9tails de l'incident parce qu'ils figuraient au formulaire de plainte qu'elle avait soumis \u00e0 la Commission.\n[16] Dans sa plainte, Mme Hunt a affirm\u00e9 avoir r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la suggestion de M. Wadhwa voulant que [traduction] tout ce dont elle avait besoin, c'\u00e9tait d'un homme bon pour lui faire sa f\u00eate en lui demandant s'il en connaissait un (un [traduction] homme bon). Il a r\u00e9pondu [traduction] plein, en se pointant du doigt pendant qu'il disait ces mots. Mme Hunt a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa plainte que, \u00e0 ce moment, elle lui a tourn\u00e9 le dos et est retourn\u00e9e dans le bureau, a pris ses cl\u00e9s et est partie.\n[17] J'accepte que les renseignements contenus dans la plainte de Mme Hunt sont suffisamment fiables pour combler les lacunes de son t\u00e9moignage au sujet de sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 M. Wadhwa. Bien que Mme Hunt n'ait pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que sa plainte soit introduite en preuve, le Tribunal a le droit, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 58(3)c) de la Loi, de recevoir des renseignements par le moyen qu'il estime indiqu\u00e9, m\u00eame si ces renseignements ne seraient pas admissibles devant un tribunal judiciaire. Le formulaire de plainte est sign\u00e9 par Mme Hunt et dat\u00e9 du 19 septembre 2005, peu apr\u00e8s que les incidents se sont produits. Les renseignements dans la plainte ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9s alors qu'ils \u00e9taient encore frais \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire de Mme Hunt. Pour ces motifs, j'ai accept\u00e9 les renseignements qui y sont inscrits \u00e0 propos de cet incident en particulier.\n[18] Mme Hunt a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, le 19 ao\u00fbt 2005, elle s'est encore trouv\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler seule avec M. Dibbley. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Dibbley n'arr\u00eatait pas de venir \u00e0 son bureau pour lui demander de bouger, tout en la fr\u00f4lant ou en essayant de prendre un objet en passant son bras autour d'elle. Ce matin-l\u00e0, M. Wadhwa a encore t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Hunt pour lui demander de venir le chercher pour l'amener au travail. Quand Mme Hunt a tent\u00e9 de sortir de la roulotte pour aller chercher M. Wadhwa, M. Dibbley lui a bloqu\u00e9 le chemin vers la porte avec son bras. Elle a tent\u00e9 de le contourner plusieurs fois, mais il ne l'a pas laiss\u00e9e passer. Mme Hunt a ensuite us\u00e9 de plus de force pour contourner M. Dibbley, mais M. Dibbley en a profit\u00e9 pour lui caresser les seins et le ventre. Mme Hunt \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9e par cet incident.\n[19] Une fois qu'elle eut pris M. Wadhwa chez lui, Mme Hunt lui a racont\u00e9 ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 et \u00e0 quel point elle en \u00e9tait boulevers\u00e9e. M. Wadhwa lui a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] Tout va s'arranger.\n[20] \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e au travail le 22 ao\u00fbt 2005, Mme Hunt a appris que M. Dibbley avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 \u00e0 du travail de r\u00e9partition en apr\u00e8s-midi. Cela voulait dire qu'elle verrait moins M. Dibbley dans un avenir assez rapproch\u00e9. Cependant, elle s'inqui\u00e9tait encore de ce qui pouvait se produire avec M. Wadhwa.\n[21] Le 24 ao\u00fbt 2005, Mme Hunt a dit \u00e0 M. Bronson, aujourd'hui directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, \u00e0 quel point elle \u00e9tait perturb\u00e9e du traitement qu'on lui r\u00e9servait et qu'elle allait se chercher un nouvel emploi. M. Bronson l'a encourag\u00e9e \u00e0 rester chez Transport One Ltd., en affirmant que les choses allaient s'arranger. Il ne lui a pas expliqu\u00e9 ce qu'il voulait dire par l\u00e0. Mme Hunt a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi chez Transport One Ltd. plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0, quand M. Wadhwa l'a trait\u00e9e de [traduction] putain d'idiote parce qu'elle n'arrivait pas \u00e0 trouver un papillon adh\u00e9sif qu'elle avait plac\u00e9 sur son ordinateur.\n[22] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas comparu \u00e0 l'audience et, par cons\u00e9quent, n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la version des \u00e9v\u00e9nements pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Hunt au sujet de ses cinq semaines d'emploi chez Transport One Ltd.\nLe harc\u00e8lement sexuel [23] L'alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Aux termes du paragraphe 14(2), le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[24] Le harc\u00e8lement sexuel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini comme une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail (Janzen c. Platy Enterprises, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, \u00e0 la page 1284). Afin de d\u00e9terminer si la conduite est importune, le tribunal tient compte de la r\u00e9action de la plaignante au moment o\u00f9 l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement en question s'est produit et d\u00e9termine si celle-ci a express\u00e9ment d\u00e9montr\u00e9, par son comportement, que la conduite \u00e9tait importune. Un refus verbal n'a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre exprim\u00e9 dans tous les cas (Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Franke, [1999] 3 C.F. 653 (1re inst.), au paragraphe 36). N\u00e9anmoins, la plaignante doit \u00e9tablir, par exemple au moyen de son langage corporel ou en omettant \u00e0 maintes reprises de r\u00e9pondre aux commentaires suggestifs, qu'elle a de quelque fa\u00e7on signal\u00e9 \u00e0 l'auteur du harc\u00e8lement que sa conduite \u00e9tait importune. La r\u00e9action \u00e0 des avances sexuelles peut se traduire par un refus net ou de l'indignation ou encore par un silence de pierre ou une d\u00e9robade. Les deux r\u00e9actions t\u00e9moignent d'une conduite non sollicit\u00e9e ou importune (Miller c. Sam's Pizza House, [1995] N.S.H.R.B.I.D. no 2 (Q.L.).\n[25] Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la d\u00e9finition exige que la conduite soit de nature sexuelle. Les tribunaux des droits de la personne ont reconnu une vaste gamme de conduites qui peuvent \u00eatre vis\u00e9es par la d\u00e9finition du harc\u00e8lement sexuel, selon les circonstances, y compris les insultes d'ordre sexuel, les remarques sexistes, les commentaires concernant l'apparence d'une personne, sa tenue vestimentaire ou ses habitudes sexuelles (Franke, au paragraphe 37).\n[26] Finalement, l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige que l'employ\u00e9 avise, si possible, l'employeur de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite offensante (Franke, au paragraphe 47).\n[27] Le harc\u00e8lement exige g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement la pr\u00e9sence d'un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, m\u00eame si dans certaines circonstances un seul incident suffit peut-\u00eatre pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile. Certaines formes de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, comme les agressions sexuelles, peuvent \u00eatre suffisamment graves pour constituer en tant que telles du harc\u00e8lement sexuel m\u00eame s'il n'y a qu'un seul incident. \u00c0 cause de leur gravit\u00e9, pareils incidents cr\u00e9eraient imm\u00e9diatement un milieu de travail empoisonn\u00e9. Plus la conduite est grave et ses cons\u00e9quences manifestes, moins la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition sera exig\u00e9e; \u00e0 l'inverse, moins la conduite est grave et ses cons\u00e9quences manifestes, plus la persistance devra \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e (Franke, aux paragraphes 43 \u00e0 45).\n[28] Par exemple, dans Goodwin c. Birkett, il n'y a eu qu'un incident \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel, mais il y avait eu contact physique (Goodwin c. Birkett, 2004 TCDP 29, au paragraphe 22; conf. par 2007 CF 428). La plaignante s'est r\u00e9veill\u00e9e \u00e0 3 h pour trouver l'intim\u00e9 dans son lit d'h\u00f4tel qui la caressait de mani\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9e. Elle lui a dit d'arr\u00eater et il a quitt\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce. Le Tribunal a conclu que cet incident \u00e9tait suffisamment s\u00e9rieux pour empoisonner le milieu de travail. Par cons\u00e9quent, il constituait du harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\n[29] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Hunt d\u00e9crivant la conduite de M. Dibbley r\u00e9pond aux crit\u00e8res du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. \u00c0 deux reprises, il y a eu contact physique de nature sexuelle : tirer vers le bas la fermeture \u00e9clair du blouson de Mme Hunt et l'emp\u00eacher de sortir de la roulotte. Au cours des deux incidents, M. Dibbley a caress\u00e9 les seins et le ventre de Mme Hunt. Lors du premier incident, il a formul\u00e9 des remarques \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel. Lors du second incident, M. Dibbley a tent\u00e9 d'emp\u00eacher Mme Hunt de sortir de la roulotte afin de l'obliger \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 des attouchements sexuels. Cela lui a fait tr\u00e8s peur.\n[30] Mme Hunt a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir laiss\u00e9 savoir \u00e0 M. Dibbley que le contact sexuel \u00e9tait importun en lui demandant avec col\u00e8re ce qu'il faisait lors du premier incident ainsi qu'en l'\u00e9vitant, en pleurant et en refusant de lui parler. La conduite de M. Dibbley a boulevers\u00e9 Mme Hunt; elle se sentait malade au travail et ses sympt\u00f4mes d'ulc\u00e8re sont r\u00e9apparus. Mme Hunt a avis\u00e9 son employeur, M. Wadhwa, de ce qui s'\u00e9tait produit le 19 ao\u00fbt 2005.\n[31] Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que M. Dibbley ne se soit mal conduit qu'en deux occasions, la nature tr\u00e8s grave et physique de la conduite sexuelle et ses cons\u00e9quences pour Mme Hunt suffisaient \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail empoisonn\u00e9.\n[32] La proposition sexuelle grossi\u00e8re et l'\u00e9treinte de M. Wadhwa le 18 ao\u00fbt 2005 constituent-elles du harc\u00e8lement sexuel? Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Hunt, M. Wadhwa a pass\u00e9 son bras autour d'elle alors qu'elle pleurait \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la roulotte et il lui a dit que tout ce dont elle avait [traduction] besoin, c'\u00e9tait d'un homme bon pour lui faire sa f\u00eate. Mme Hunt pleurait et \u00e9tait visiblement boulevers\u00e9e avant que M. Wadhwa l'\u00e9treigne et lui fasse sa proposition. L'\u00e9tat de vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 \u00e9motive de Mme Hunt aurait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour son employeur un premier indice r\u00e9v\u00e9lant que ses avances, qui \u00e9taient clairement de nature sexuelle, ne seraient pas les bienvenues.\n[33] Bien qu'il soit moins habituel d'analyser le comportement du plaignant avant l'incident en cause pour d\u00e9terminer si l'attention \u00e9tait bienvenue ou non, j'estime qu'il convient de le faire lorsque, comme en l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant se trouve dans une relation de subordination en emploi par rapport au harceleur pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 et par cons\u00e9quent peut ne pas \u00eatre en position de faire clairement savoir sa r\u00e9action n\u00e9gative au comportement apr\u00e8s qu'il a eu lieu. En outre, un examen de la conduite du plaignant tout juste avant l'incident en cause tient compte du fait qu'il incombe \u00e0 ceux qui souhaitent faire des avances sexuelles \u00e0 leur subordonn\u00e9 de s'assurer, avant de faire leurs avances, qu'elles seront probablement bienvenues.\n[34] Plut\u00f4t que de s'informer de la source du d\u00e9sarroi de Mme Hunt quand elle se tenait \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la roulotte, M. Wadhwa a profit\u00e9 de sa vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 \u00e9motive et a fait une proposition sexuelle grossi\u00e8re. Compte tenu de l'autorit\u00e9 de M. Wadhwa sur Mme Hunt, ses avances sexuelles prenaient un caract\u00e8re plus coercitif que s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un employ\u00e9 du m\u00eame niveau que Mme Hunt. La remarque de M. Wadhwa a fait en sorte que Mme Hunt s'est sentie encore plus vuln\u00e9rable au travail, puisque la personne m\u00eame sur qui elle comptait pour redresser la situation avec M. Dibbley avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle aussi cherchait \u00e0 prendre avantage sexuellement de l'emploi de Mme Hunt chez Transport One Ltd.\n[35] Apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9treinte et la remarque au sujet du fait que Mme Hunt avait besoin d'un homme bon pour [traduction] lui faire sa f\u00eate, Mme Hunt a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Wadhwa s'il connaissait un [traduction] homme bon. Elle lui a ensuite tourn\u00e9 le dos, est retourn\u00e9e dans la roulotte, a ramass\u00e9 ses choses et est partie. Vue dans l'ensemble, cette suite d'actions indique que Mme Hunt ne voulait pas des avances sexuelles de M. Wadhwa.\n[36] Je conclus que, bien qu'il n'y ait eu qu'un seul incident, la conduite de M. Wadhwa, la personne qui a embauch\u00e9 Mme Hunt, \u00e9tait suffisamment s\u00e9rieuse et importune pour cr\u00e9er sans autre apport un milieu de travail hostile pour Mme Hunt. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette conduite constitue du harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e pour le harc\u00e8lement sexuel [37] Selon l'article 65 de la Loi, les actes commis par un employ\u00e9, un mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant dans le cadre de son emploi sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par la personne, l'organisme ou l'association qui l'emploie, sauf s'il \u00e9tablit que l'acte a eu lieu sans son consentement, qu'il avait pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l'emp\u00eacher et que, par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 d'en att\u00e9nuer ou d'en annuler les effets.\n[38] Un employeur peut prendre un certain nombre de mesures pour \u00e9viter le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail : faire savoir aux employ\u00e9s nouvellement embauch\u00e9s que le harc\u00e8lement ne sera pas tol\u00e9r\u00e9 au travail; fournir des s\u00e9ances d'information sur le harc\u00e8lement aux employ\u00e9s, aux superviseurs et aux directeurs de l'entreprise; \u00e9laborer des politiques sur le harc\u00e8lement ainsi que des proc\u00e9dures d'enqu\u00eate et les afficher dans un endroit public. Parmi les strat\u00e9gies efficaces pour att\u00e9nuer les effets du harc\u00e8lement, il y a : informer les individus concern\u00e9s de la proc\u00e9dure qui sera suivie et des mesures qui seront prises pour mettre fin au pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harc\u00e8lement; fournir des espaces de travail s\u00e9par\u00e9s pour le harceleur pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 et le plaignant; mener avec diligence et avec \u00e9quit\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate sur les plaintes de harc\u00e8lement; prendre les mesures disciplinaires appropri\u00e9es contre les harceleurs et fournir aux victimes des renseignements sur les mesures disciplinaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises; offrir des services de soutien aux personnes impliqu\u00e9es. Il conviendra ou non de prendre certaines de ces mesures en fonction des circonstances de l'affaire.\n[39] En l'esp\u00e8ce, rien ne prouve que Transport One Ltd. a pris une quelconque mesure pour pr\u00e9venir le harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Aucune preuve ne montrait l'existence de politiques contre le harc\u00e8lement et de proc\u00e9dures d'enqu\u00eate, de s\u00e9ances d'information pour les employ\u00e9s ou d'autres mesures pr\u00e9ventives similaires.\n[40] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Hunt, certaines mesures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour att\u00e9nuer les effets du harc\u00e8lement de M. Dibbley sur Mme Hunt : le quart de travail de celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 pour celui de l'apr\u00e8s-midi, ce qui diminuait le contact entre les deux employ\u00e9s. Cependant, Mme Hunt n'avait aucune garantie que les avances sexuelles importunes de M. Dibbley cesseraient de mani\u00e8re permanente, car il n'y avait eu aucune enqu\u00eate ni aucune discussion s\u00e9rieuse au sujet du probl\u00e8me avec M. Wadhwa. En outre, Mme Hunt n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que M. Dibbley avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9primand\u00e9 ou qu'on lui avait dit que le harc\u00e8lement d'employ\u00e9s ne serait pas tol\u00e9r\u00e9. Finalement, rien n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en r\u00e9action au harc\u00e8lement sexuel de M. Wadhwa \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Hunt.\n[41] M. Bronson, le directeur des ventes\/directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Transport One Ltd., a dit \u00e0 Mme Hunt de ne pas d\u00e9missionner le 24 ao\u00fbt 2005. Il lui a dit que la situation s'am\u00e9liorerait. Cependant, il n'y avait aucune indication quant au moment ou \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont cette am\u00e9lioration se ferait. En outre, M. Bronson n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 comment il serait en mesure de veiller \u00e0 ce que la conduite de son sup\u00e9rieur, M. Wadhwa, ne se reproduise plus.\n[42] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que Transport One Ltd. n'a pas pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher le harc\u00e8lement sexuel \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Hunt et n'a pas tent\u00e9 d'en att\u00e9nuer ou d'en annuler les effets. Par cons\u00e9quent, Transport One Ltd. est responsable, en vertu du paragraphe 65(1) de la Loi, des actes de M. Dibbley et de M. Wadhwa.\nLes mesures de redressement appropri\u00e9es [43] Le Tribunal tire son pouvoir de prendre des mesures de redressement de l'article 53 de la Loi. Les mesures qui y sont pr\u00e9vues visent \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire, \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir la discrimination \u00e0 l'avenir et \u00e0 indemniser les victimes des actes discriminatoires pass\u00e9s ou actuels.\n[44] Mme Hunt a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle croyait possible que l'entreprise Transport One Ltd. ne soit plus en activit\u00e9. Elle croyait m\u00eame que l'entreprise p\u00fbt avoir fait faillite. Cependant, on ne m'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9lant que Transport One Ltd. avait fait l'objet d'une proc\u00e9dure ou d'une ordonnance en application de la Loi sur la faillite et l'insolvabilit\u00e9. En l'absence de tels renseignements, il demeure appropri\u00e9 pour le Tribunal d'exercer le pouvoir en mati\u00e8re d'indemnisation que lui conf\u00e8re l'article 53.\n[45] Mme Hunt a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de mesure de redressement que Transport One Ltd. soit tenue responsable de ce qui s'est produit et qu'elle prenne des mesures pour emp\u00eacher que d'autres personnes subissent le m\u00eame harc\u00e8lement qu'elle a subi. Elle a demand\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 d'un montant de 10 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\n[46] Mme Hunt souffre d'un ulc\u00e8re. Elle prend des m\u00e9dicaments pour soulager ses sympt\u00f4mes. Au cours des cinq semaines o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 pour Transport One Ltd., ses sympt\u00f4mes d'ulc\u00e8re sont r\u00e9apparus. Elle avait constamment mal \u00e0 l'estomac. Elle croit que le stress caus\u00e9 par les avances sexuelles importunes qu'elle a re\u00e7ues de M. Dibbley et de M. Wadhwa \u00e9tait la cause de la r\u00e9apparition des sympt\u00f4mes. Le m\u00e9decin de Mme Hunt lui a prescrit un m\u00e9dicament plus fort pour traiter son ulc\u00e8re.\n[47] Bien qu'il soit clair que Mme Hunt ait subi un pr\u00e9judice important en raison du harc\u00e8lement sexuel de M. Dibbley et de M. Wadhwa, je crois que d'autres facteurs dans le milieu de travail ont contribu\u00e9 aux souffrances physiques et \u00e9motionnelles, facteurs qui n'\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire. Par exemple, Mme Hunt a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le manque d'\u00e9quipement de bureau et l'aspect concret du milieu de travail repr\u00e9sentaient une source de frustration pour elle. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9galement irrit\u00e9e du nombre de commissions personnelles que M. Wadhwa lui demandait de faire. Compte tenu du fait que le pr\u00e9judice moral subi par Mme Hunt n'\u00e9tait pas enti\u00e8rement attribuable \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire, j'estime qu'il convient d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 de 6 000 $ dans les circonstances.\n[48] Afin d'\u00e9viter que le harc\u00e8lement comme celui qu'a subi Mme Hunt se reproduise \u00e0 l'avenir, il est n\u00e9cessaire de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de prendre certaines mesures. Au minimum, il faudrait fournir \u00e0 toutes les personnes travaillant pour l'intim\u00e9e des renseignements (que ce soit sous la forme de politiques et proc\u00e9dures, ou simplement d'une d\u00e9claration par un repr\u00e9sentant de l'entreprise) lesquels expliquent en quoi consiste le harc\u00e8lement et que le harc\u00e8lement ne sera pas tol\u00e9r\u00e9 et lesquels pr\u00e9sentent les proc\u00e9dures qui seront suivies en cas de harc\u00e8lement. Il va sans dire que de tels renseignements ne pr\u00e9viennent efficacement le harc\u00e8lement que s'ils sont enti\u00e8rement compris par toutes les personnes au travail. Dans ce but, des s\u00e9ances d'information ou des programmes de sensibilisation sont utiles pour transmettre aux employ\u00e9s, aux superviseurs et aux directeurs de l'entreprise les connaissances n\u00e9cessaires pour que les politiques de pr\u00e9vention du harc\u00e8lement fonctionnent.\n[49] Afin d'emp\u00eacher qu'un acte discriminatoire comme celui qu'a v\u00e9cu Mme Hunt se reproduise \u00e0 l'avenir, il convient de rendre l'ordonnance suivante, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi :\nSi l'intim\u00e9e poss\u00e8de des lignes de conduite et des proc\u00e9dures concernant le harc\u00e8lement sexuel, elle doit fournir ces documents \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne pour qu'elle les examine. Si l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e9labor\u00e9 de lignes de conduite ou de proc\u00e9dures portant sur la pr\u00e9vention et le traitement des plaintes de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, elle doit le faire en collaboration avec la Commission. Quand l'intim\u00e9e aura la version d\u00e9finitive de ces documents, un exemplaire des lignes de conduite et proc\u00e9dures sera affich\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que tous les employ\u00e9s y aient acc\u00e8s; L'intim\u00e9e offrira, \u00e0 ses frais, un programme pour les employ\u00e9s, les superviseurs et les directeurs de l'entreprise pour les sensibiliser \u00e0 la question du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Elle consultera la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne quant au contenu du programme et quant aux fournisseurs potentiels du programme.\n[50] En outre, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), le Tribunal ordonne :\n3. L'intim\u00e9e versera 6 000 $ \u00e0 Mme Hunt \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'elle a subi en raison de l'acte discriminatoire.\nSign\u00e9e par Karen A.

Grant Sinclair Date : Le 16 juin 2008 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2008 TCDP 24\n[1] L'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (AFPC) demande \u00e0 \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme partie aux plaintes de Marie-Claire Coupal et de Biserka Milinkovich d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (ASFC).\n[2] Mme Coupal \u00e9tait une agente des services frontaliers (ASF) au poste frontalier terrestre de Windsor lorsque l'ASFC a mis en place une formation sur le recours \u00e0 la force (FRF) pour ses agents. La formation donne aux ASF les connaissances et les comp\u00e9tences dont ils ont besoin pour r\u00e9agir \u00e0 des conflits potentiels ou r\u00e9els dans le cadre de leurs fonctions. Mme Coupal soutient qu'en raison de son invalidit\u00e9 partielle et de son \u00e2ge, elle n'a pas pu participer \u00e0 la FRF. Elle s'est plainte du fait que l'ASFC avait restreint ses t\u00e2ches parce qu'elle n'avait pas suivi la formation et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle a perdu des occasions d'emploi.\n[3] Mme Milinkovich \u00e9tait candidate re\u00e7ue pour un poste d'ASF aux Op\u00e9rations du courrier international de l'ASFC \u00e0 Toronto. Elle soutient qu'on l'a emp\u00each\u00e9e d'obtenir un poste d'ASF parce que l'ASFC a suppos\u00e9 que ses restrictions physiques ne lui permettraient pas de suivre la FRF.\n[4] La question en litige dans les deux plaintes est la suivante : la politique de l'ASFC en mati\u00e8re de formation sur le recours \u00e0 la force (FRF) pour les ASF est-elle discriminatoire envers les plaignantes en raison de leur invalidit\u00e9 ou de leur \u00e2ge, en violation de l'article 7 de la Loi. La plainte de Mme Coupal comprend aussi l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l'exigence en mati\u00e8re de FRF est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus en raison de leur invalidit\u00e9 ou de leur \u00e2ge, en violation de l'article 10 de la Loi.\n[5] L'AFPC souhaite \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme plaignante afin de discuter des all\u00e9gations portant sur la discrimination syst\u00e9mique qui font partie de la plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10 de Mme Coupal et afin de demander un redressement appropri\u00e9 au nom de tous les agents des services frontaliers s\u2019il est conclu que les plaintes sont fond\u00e9es.\n[6] Les plaignantes ont consenti au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate.\n[7] L'ASFC s'oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 adjoindre l'AFPC comme partie. Elle soutient que le Tribunal n'a pas la comp\u00e9tence d'ajouter l'AFPC comme plaignante et que, subsidiairement, l'AFPC ne satisfait pas au crit\u00e8re de l'adjonction d'une partie.\n[8] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi, d'adjoindre des parties \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure existante. Dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas, le Tribunal a exerc\u00e9 ce pouvoir afin d'ajouter des intim\u00e9s plut\u00f4t que des plaignants.\n[9] La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit que l'adjonction de parties doit \u00eatre faite avec prudence et seulement apr\u00e8s un examen minutieux d'un certain nombre de facteurs, notamment les questions de savoir : si l'ajout de la partie est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de la plainte, s'il pouvait \u00eatre raisonnablement pr\u00e9vu que la nouvelle partie aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e lorsque la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et si l'adjonction de la partie constituera un pr\u00e9judice grave \u00e0 la partie adverse (voir, par exemple : Brown c. Commission de la capitale nationale, 2003 TCDP 43; Wade c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2008 TCDP 9; et Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail c. Barbe, 2003 TCDP 24, dans laquelle d\u00e9cision le Tribunal a accueilli la requ\u00eate en ajout d'un plaignant. Voir aussi : Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone c. TELUS Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., 2003 TCDP 31, au paragraphe 30; et Smith c. CN, 2005 TCDP 23, au paragraphe 52).\n[10] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'AFPC soutient que sa participation \u00e0 titre de plaignante est n\u00e9cessaire puisqu'elle seule peut fournir les renseignements qui aideront le Tribunal \u00e0 trouver un redressement appropri\u00e9, si la plainte au sujet de l'article 10 est fond\u00e9e. Selon l'AFPC, le redressement appropri\u00e9 en serait un qui s'applique \u00e0 tous les ASF au Canada. Les ASF remplissent des fonctions extr\u00eamement vari\u00e9es partout au pays, dans environ 12 000 points d'entr\u00e9e au Canada, qui comprennent les postes frontaliers terrestres, les a\u00e9roports, les ports de mer, les services postaux et les centres de d\u00e9tention d\u2019immigration.\n[11] Compte tenu de la diversit\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches et de l'environnement de travail des ASF, la nature et la port\u00e9e des risques auxquels ils font face au travail varient grandement. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de suivre la FRF varie donc tout autant. L'AFPC soutient que le Tribunal a besoin de renseignements au sujet de la nature et de la port\u00e9e des risques auxquels ce groupe de travail diversifi\u00e9 fait face afin de trouver un redressement qui n'est pas restreint par l'environnement de travail des plaignantes \u2013 le poste frontalier terrestre de Windsor et les Op\u00e9rations du courrier international \u00e0 Toronto.\n[12] En supposant, sans me prononcer, que la port\u00e9e de la plainte est assez large pour comprendre un redressement qui toucherait tous les ASF au Canada qui se trouvent dans des circonstances semblables \u00e0 celles des plaignantes, je ne vois aucune raison pour laquelle les plaignantes ne pourraient pas appeler l'AFPC comme t\u00e9moin afin qu'elle fournisse les renseignements susmentionn\u00e9s. L'ajout de l'AFPC comme partie n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour qu'elle pr\u00e9sente les renseignements au Tribunal.\n[13] Le refus d'accorder \u00e0 l'AFPC le statut de partie n'emp\u00eacherait pas les plaignantes de pr\u00e9senter des arguments au sujet du redressement syst\u00e9mique qui devrait \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 s'il est conclu que la plainte est fond\u00e9e. Il convient de noter que l'AFPC semble travailler en \u00e9troite collaboration avec les plaignantes \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[14] Il ne s'agit pas d'une affaire comme celle de Brown c. Commission de la capitale nationale, 2003 TCDP 43, dans laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d'ajouter le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics comme intim\u00e9, puisqu'il \u00e9tait impossible d'appliquer le redressement appropri\u00e9 sans l'adjonction de cette partie. L'affaire n'est pas non plus semblable \u00e0 celle du Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail c. Barbe, dans laquelle le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 la victime de l'acte discriminatoire comme plaignante. Dans cette affaire, il convenait d'ajouter Mme Des Rosiers comme plaignante afin de r\u00e9gler une plainte dans laquelle elle \u00e9tait l'unique int\u00e9ress\u00e9e.\n[15] En ce qui a trait au fait que Mme Coupal peut appeler un repr\u00e9sentant de l'AFPC pour qu'il t\u00e9moigne au sujet des autres ASF, l'AFPC a r\u00e9pondu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s'opposera probablement \u00e0 ce t\u00e9moignage au motif qu'il n'est pas pertinent : la port\u00e9e des plaintes se limite aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res des lieux de travail des plaignantes et, par cons\u00e9quent, toute information au sujet d'autres lieux de travail n'est pas pertinente.\n[16] Si l'AFPC avait des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet du fait que la port\u00e9e de la plainte pouvait ne pas \u00eatre assez large pour comprendre les circonstances de tous les ASF au Canada, alors elle aurait d\u00fb mentionner ces pr\u00e9occupations lorsque la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite ou peu de temps apr\u00e8s qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[17] L'AFPC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle discutait avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on continue au sujet de la formation sur le recours \u00e0 la force depuis au moins 2001.\n[18] De plus, il semble que l'AFPC participe aux pr\u00e9sentes plaintes depuis au moins l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate. Elle avait la possibilit\u00e9 de demander \u00e0 \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme partie \u00e0 la plainte si elle le jugeait n\u00e9cessaire, avant que la Commission renvoie la plainte au Tribunal.\n[19] Cette situation est encore plus \u00e9vidente lorsqu'on tient compte du fait que la Commission a d'abord rejet\u00e9 la plainte et que c'est apr\u00e8s le contr\u00f4le judiciaire que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission pour qu'elle fasse une nouvelle enqu\u00eate et rende une nouvelle d\u00e9cision. L'AFPC a donc eu amplement la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre connaissance de l'affaire et de demander \u00e0 \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme partie avant que l'affaire soit renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[20] Lorsqu'une plainte est renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, l'adjonction d'une partie pourrait entra\u00eener la n\u00e9gation de l'avantage de certaines protections proc\u00e9durales qui sont garanties \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape avant le renvoi. Ces protections comprennent la possibilit\u00e9 de persuader la Commission, pendant le processus d'enqu\u00eate, qu'elle devrait refuser de traiter la plainte parce que, par exemple, la plainte n'est pas fond\u00e9e ou elle porte sur des actes ou des omissions qui se sont produits plus d'un an avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte (Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 48, aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 7).\n[21] L'AFPC soutient qu'il n'y aurait pas manquement \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale envers l\u2019intim\u00e9e si le Tribunal contournait le processus de la Commission compte tenu du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e sait depuis 2001 que l'AFPC a des inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 la FRF telle qu'elle \u00e9tait appliqu\u00e9e aux travailleurs \u00e2g\u00e9s ou atteints d'une invalidit\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne devrait donc pas \u00eatre surprise du point de vue de l'AFPC au sujet des plaintes. C'est peut-\u00eatre le cas, mais l'argument ne traite pas de la perte des protections proc\u00e9durales qui seraient autrement disponibles, perte qui pourrait \u00eatre caus\u00e9e par l'ajout de l'AFPC comme plaignante \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[22] Pour toutes ces raisons, le Tribunal conclut qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une affaire dans laquelle il peut exercer de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b), pour ajouter l'AFPC comme plaignante dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.

Jensen Date : Le 16 juin 2008 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2008 TCDP 25\n[1] Les intim\u00e9es, Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada et l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, demandent qu'une ordonnance soit rendue pour interdire que certaines preuves soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audition d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Keith Jeffers en avril 2004. La plainte porte sur des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles, entre 2002 et 2004, M. Jeffers a subi un traitement discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur sa race et son origine nationale ou ethnique \u00e0 l'a\u00e9roport international Pearson, lorsqu'on l'a interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de sa citoyennet\u00e9.\n[2] Les intim\u00e9es demandent une ordonnance interdisant au plaignant de pr\u00e9senter le rapport du Dr. Scot Wortley intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Diff\u00e9rences raciales dans les fouilles effectu\u00e9es par les douanes \u00e0 l'a\u00e9roport international Pearson en preuve \u00e0 l'audience. Les intim\u00e9es demandent aussi une ordonnance interdisant au plaignant de pr\u00e9senter un rapport intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00c9tude sur les minorit\u00e9s visibles aux douanes du Canada en preuve \u00e0 l'audience. La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tude a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e par COMPAS Inc., un cabinet sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en recherches visant divers auditoires.\n[3] Une certaine incertitude a plan\u00e9 quant \u00e0 savoir si le Dr. Wortley serait un t\u00e9moin expert \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Cependant, cette question semble \u00eatre r\u00e9solue. La Commission, plut\u00f4t que le plaignant, a l\u2019intention d\u2019appeler le Dr. Wortley comme t\u00e9moin expert et de pr\u00e9senter son rapport pendant le t\u00e9moignage.\n[4] Les intim\u00e9es soutiennent n\u00e9anmoins que le rapport du Dr. Wortley ne peut pas \u00eatre admis en preuve pour un certain nombre de raisons. Ces raisons comprennent l'affirmation selon laquelle le rapport n'est pas fiable, est inutile et n'est pas pertinent. Ils font aussi valoir que de nombreux autres tribunaux et cours ont aussi rejet\u00e9 le rapport du Dr. Wortley. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal devrait ordonner, avant l'audience, que le rapport du Dr. Wortley ne soit pas admis en preuve \u00e0 l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente demande.\n[5] \u00c0 mon avis, la question de l'admissibilit\u00e9 du rapport Wortley est une question qu'il vaut mieux trancher \u00e0 l'audience. L'un des crit\u00e8res r\u00e9gissant l'admissibilit\u00e9 d'un t\u00e9moignage d'expert est que la preuve doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un expert comp\u00e9tent. La Commission et\/ou le plaignant n'a pas encore eu la possibilit\u00e9 de tenter de prouver la comp\u00e9tence du Dr. Wortley. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est pr\u00e9sentement impossible de rendre une d\u00e9cision au sujet de l'admissibilit\u00e9 du rapport Wortley. Les intim\u00e9es pourront soulever leurs objections quant \u00e0 l'admissibilit\u00e9 du rapport au moment appropri\u00e9 pendant l'audience.\n[6] Les intim\u00e9es soutiennent que le rapport COMPAS au sujet d'une \u00e9tude men\u00e9e sur les minorit\u00e9s visibles aux douanes du Canada ne peut pas \u00eatre admis en preuve pour les m\u00eames raisons que le rapport Wortley et pour une raison suppl\u00e9mentaire : l'auteur de l'\u00e9tude ne t\u00e9moignera pas. Par cons\u00e9quent, les intim\u00e9es font valoir que le rapport COMPAS ne constituerait qu'une preuve par ou\u00ef-dire tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9judiciable et que, pour ces raisons, il n'est pas admissible en preuve.\n[7] La Commission explique que le rapport COMPAS n'est pas un rapport d'expert, mais qu'il est plut\u00f4t un document interne pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande d'une des intim\u00e9es. Elle fait valoir que le rapport est pertinent et essentiel pour que le Tribunal puisse d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu profilage racial en l'esp\u00e8ce. Elle soutient aussi que les intim\u00e9es peuvent produire des preuves pour r\u00e9futer les renseignements qui se trouvent dans le rapport COMPAS, s'ils le jugent n\u00e9cessaire. Le plaignant n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[8] Lorsque le Tribunal est saisi d'une objection, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience, portant sur l'admissibilit\u00e9 d'une preuve, en tant que ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure, il n'a pas \u00e0 trancher l'objection \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, ou s'il le fait, il n'a pas \u00e0 la trancher exactement comme elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Cependant, pour certaines affaires, comme c'est le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce, une d\u00e9cision anticip\u00e9e pourrait grandement aider les avocats \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer pour l'audience et permettrait un d\u00e9roulement rapide et \u00e9quitable de l'audience. Dans de tels cas, il convient d'examiner la preuve telle qu'elle est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et de d\u00e9terminer, avant l'audience, si la valeur en vaut le co\u00fbt. (Voir Morin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2003 TCDP 46, au paragraphe 6.)\n[9] Je crois que l'argument des intim\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce, au sujet du rapport COMPAS, est fond\u00e9. La Commission cherche \u00e0 produire le rapport pour prouver la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de son contenu. Le rapport constitue une preuve par ou\u00ef-dire \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage de l'auteur de l'\u00e9tude ou de toute autre personne qui a une connaissance directe de l'\u00e9tude et de la production du rapport.\n[10] Bien que le Tribunal puisse accepter des preuves par ou\u00ef-dire, il n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de le faire. Pour d\u00e9cider s'il admet des preuves par ou\u00ef-dire, il convient \u00e0 un tribunal administratif de tenir compte des facteurs de la fiabilit\u00e9 et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 (R. c. Khan [1990] 2 R.C.S. 531; Telus Communications Inc. c. Telecomunications Workers Union, 2005 CAF 262 (CanLII) aux paragraphes 26-29). Ces facteurs doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on souple et en tenant d\u00fbment compte de la latitude dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie le Tribunal en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'admission d'une preuve qui sinon ne serait pas recevable dans un tribunal judiciaire (alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la LCDP; Telus, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 28; et R. c. Hawkins [1996] 3 R.C.S. 1043, au paragraphe 68).\n[11] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 pourquoi il est n\u00e9cessaire que la preuve soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par quelqu'un d'autre que l'auteur du rapport COMPAS ou par toute autre personne qui a des connaissances directes de l'\u00e9tude et de la production du rapport. L'introduction du rapport indique que l'enqu\u00eateur principal de l'\u00e9tude et l'auteur du rapport est Stephen Kiar, un associ\u00e9 principal de COMPAS. Au d\u00e9part, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il demanderait \u00e0 un repr\u00e9sentant de COMPAS de t\u00e9moigner au sujet du rapport. Plus tard, lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d'instance, le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 aux parties et au Tribunal qu'il demanderait plut\u00f4t au directeur ex\u00e9cutif de la Clinique juridique afro-canadienne de pr\u00e9senter le rapport COMPAS. Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 au plaignant de d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 qui comprendrait une liste r\u00e9vis\u00e9e des t\u00e9moins ainsi qu'un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de leurs t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus. Le plaignant n'a pas fourni les documents demand\u00e9s et il n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi M. Kiar, ou toute autre personne qui a des connaissances directes de l'\u00e9tude et de la production du rapport, ne pouvait pas \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'a pas \u00e9tabli la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'appeler le directeur ex\u00e9cutif de la Clinique juridique afro-canadienne pour qu'il pr\u00e9sente la preuve.\n[12] De plus, il existe des doutes au sujet de la fiabilit\u00e9 et de la valeur probante des conclusions tir\u00e9es dans le rapport COMPAS. Deux des conclusions du rapport laissent entendre que les personnes de race noire \u00e0 Toronto sont souvent assujetties \u00e0 un temps d\u2019attente plus long ou \u00e0 plus de fouilles que les blancs, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'ils reviennent des Cara\u00efbes, et que ce groupe est d'avis que les agents des douanes traitent ses membres de fa\u00e7on injuste. Cependant, \u00e0 la page 3 du rapport, l'auteur d\u00e9clare que [Traduction] [l]a recherche est de nature qualitative et non quantitative. Par cons\u00e9quent, les r\u00e9sultats donnent une id\u00e9e des points de vue des participants quant aux sujets qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9s, mais ils ne peuvent pas \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9s \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 des voyageurs qui appartiennent \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible. \u00c0 la page 6 du rapport, l'auteur d\u00e9clare que [Traduction] les lecteurs ne devraient pas consid\u00e9rer la recherche comme \u00e9tant une repr\u00e9sentation statistique des voyageurs qui appartiennent \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible.\n[13] Cela signifie-t-il que les conclusions du rapport, telles que celle pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, ne peuvent pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on fiable \u00e0 l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce? Si c'est le cas, alors la valeur probante du rapport COMPAS pourrait \u00eatre minime. De plus, compte tenu du fait que les conclusions sont essentielles \u00e0 l'instruction en l'esp\u00e8ce et qu'elles sont pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e0 la cause des intim\u00e9es, il serait injuste d'admettre le rapport en preuve sans permettre aux intim\u00e9es de contre-interroger l'auteur, ou toute autre personne qui a des connaissances directes au sujet de l'\u00e9tude et du rapport, en ce qui a trait aux d\u00e9clarations.\n[14] Pour ces motifs, le rapport COMPAS ne sera pas introduit en preuve par le t\u00e9moignage d'un repr\u00e9sentant de la Clinique juridique afro-canadienne. La pr\u00e9sente ordonnance est rendue sans porter atteinte au droit de la Commission ou du plaignant de demander que le rapport soit introduit en preuve par le t\u00e9moignage d'une autre personne.\nSign\u00e9e par\nKaren A.

Sa plainte vise la Southern Chiefs Organization Inc. (SCO), un organisme cadre regroupant jusqu'\u00e0 36 collectivit\u00e9s de Premi\u00e8res nations du sud du Manitoba.\n[2] Mme Keeper-Anderson est une femme autochtone de la Premi\u00e8re nation Fisher River et est m\u00e8re de sept enfants. Elle est titulaire d'un baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e8s arts et poss\u00e8de plusieurs ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience de travail aupr\u00e8s des Premi\u00e8res nations du sud du Manitoba.\n[3] Mme Keeper-Anderson a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e \u00e0 l'origine par la SCO en mai 2001 \u00e0 titre de chercheuse pour l'Initiative sur l'Accord-cadre (IAC), Services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille (SEF). Elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de recherchiste jusqu'au 27 novembre 2001, date \u00e0 laquelle elle est devenue gestionnaire de projets des SEF pour la SCO.\n[4] L'IAC est une entente cadre de subventions conclue entre le Canada et l'Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC). En vertu de l'IAC, l'AMC a sign\u00e9 une entente auxiliaire avec la Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO) pour coordonner les programmes de SEF au nom de toutes les Premi\u00e8res nations du Manitoba. La MKO a sign\u00e9 une entente auxiliaire compl\u00e9mentaire avec la SCO pour qu'elle coordonne le programme de SEF pour toutes les Premi\u00e8res nations du sud du Manitoba.\n[5] L'entente entre l'AMC et la MKO pr\u00e9voit que la MKO pr\u00e9sentera des rapports d'\u00e9tapes et des rapports financiers \u00e0 la direction de l'AMC au sujet des activit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues des SEF conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un calendrier des rapports. Les rapports doivent \u00eatre remis \u00e0 temps pour que les fonds puissent \u00eatre transmis du Canada \u00e0 l'AMC, puis \u00e0 la MKO et \u00e0 la SCO.\n[6] Dans le cadre du projet que Mme Keeper-Anderson g\u00e9rait, celle-ci devait rencontrer chacune des collectivit\u00e9s de Premi\u00e8res nations du sud du Manitoba pour interroger les a\u00een\u00e9s ainsi que d'autres personnes des collectivit\u00e9s et recueillir des informations au sujet de l'\u00e9ducation traditionnelle des enfants.\n[7] Apr\u00e8s la collecte des renseignements, ceux-ci devaient \u00eatre traduits du cri et de l'ojibway vers l'anglais et ensuite compil\u00e9s dans un rapport global devant \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'AMC et \u00e0 la MKO afin d'\u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour n\u00e9gocier une entente d'autonomie gouvernementale sur les services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[8] Le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004, Mme Keeper-Anderson a quitt\u00e9 la SCO. Elle pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre partie en cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e0 cause de complications li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa grossesse et ensuite en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et en cong\u00e9 parental. Mme Keeper-Anderson invoque qu'elle avait tout \u00e0 fait l'intention de retourner \u00e0 la SCO \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9.\n[9] La position de la SCO est \u00e0 l'inverse : la SCO affirme que Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a jamais demand\u00e9 ni re\u00e7u l'autorisation de prendre un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ou un cong\u00e9 de maladie comme l'exigeait la politique d'emploi de la SCO. De plus, selon la SCO, juste avant de prendre cong\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2004, Mme Keeper-Anderson a dit \u00e0 certains membres du personnel qu'elle d\u00e9missionnait. La SCO soutient que Mme Keeper-Anderson a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004.\nA. La plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de Mme Keeper-Anderson [10] La plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de Mme Keeper-Anderson a deux volets. D'abord, elle pr\u00e9tend que la SCO ne lui a pas fourni un milieu de travail exempt de discrimination. Deuxi\u00e8mement, elle pr\u00e9tend que la SCO a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi de mani\u00e8re injustifi\u00e9e et l'a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi. Elle invoque le sexe (la grossesse) comme motif de distinction illicite pour fonder ces deux all\u00e9gations de discrimination. Sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne est dat\u00e9e le 13 octobre 2004.\nII. LES FAITS A. Le harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 (i) Le premier incident - le souper du tournoi de golf de la SCO - septembre 2002 [11] En septembre 2002, la SCO a tenu un tournoi de golf au Kingswood Golf & Country Club Ltd. \u00e0 La Salle (Manitoba). Environ 75 personnes \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes, dont des chefs et des conseillers, des partenaires d'affaires et des membres du personnel de la SCO.\n[12] C'\u00e9tait l'anniversaire de Mme Keeper-Anderson et un farceur de Rent-A-Nerd avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour le souper du tournoi de golf afin de lui faire une surprise \u00e0 l'occasion de son anniversaire.\n[13] Mme Keeper-Anderson a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'on avait communiqu\u00e9 au farceur et sans son autorisation des renseignements personnels \u00e0 son sujet au farceur. \u00c0 son avis, le farceur a utilis\u00e9 ces renseignements pour l'humilier publiquement. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que le farceur s'est moqu\u00e9 du fait qu'elle avait un grand nombre d'enfants et qu'elle les avait tous nourris au sein ainsi que de la grosseur de ses seins.\n[14] Mme Keeper-Anderson a affirm\u00e9 que, \u00e0 la fin du souper du tournoi de golf, elle a dit \u00e0 Elva McCorrister, directrice ex\u00e9cutive de la SCO, que les commentaires du farceur \u00e0 son sujet l'avaient rendue tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l'aise. Elle ne m\u00ealait pas vie personnelle et vie professionnelle et elle a senti qu'il \u00e9tait inconvenant de rendre public ce genre de renseignement.\n[15] Mme Keeper-Anderson a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 son superviseur, Stuart Wuttke, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l'incident et lui a dit \u00e0 quel point elle \u00e9tait offusqu\u00e9e. Elle a \u00e9galement dit \u00e0 Bethany Ettawacappo et \u00e0 Eileen Doerksen, deux membres du personnel de la SCO qui \u00e9taient assises \u00e0 sa table, qu'elle \u00e9tait embarrass\u00e9e par la conduite du farceur.\n[16] Elle n'a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de plainte formelle aupr\u00e8s de M. Wuttke ou de Mme McCorrister.\n[17] Plus tard, Mme Keeper-Anderson a appris que Donna Hall, une adjointe administrative de la SCO, \u00e9tait la personne qui avait donn\u00e9 les renseignements au farceur.\n[18] Mme McCorrister a affirm\u00e9 que, avant le d\u00eener, on lui a vaguement mentionn\u00e9 qu'un acteur ou un farceur ferait un spectacle lors du souper du tournoi de golf. Elle ne savait pas qu'il s'agissait d'un farceur.\n[19] Mme McCorrister ne se rappelait pas que Mme Keeper-Anderson se soit plainte lors du souper. Le lendemain matin, elle a rencontr\u00e9 son personnel et lui a dit qu'elle n'avait pas autoris\u00e9 cela et qu'elle refusait d'autoriser que la SCO paie pour le farceur.\n(ii) Le deuxi\u00e8me incident - la r\u00e9union d'octobre 2003 [20] Mme Keeper-Anderson all\u00e8gue que, peu apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut inform\u00e9 la SCO en octobre 2003 qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte, le grand chef Margaret Swan, Elva McCorrister et Stuart Wuttke ont tenu une r\u00e9union. Mme Keeper-Anderson n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Cependant, elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lors de cette r\u00e9union, ces trois personnes ont discut\u00e9 de sa grossesse et le chef Margaret Swan aurait dit \u00e0 M. Wuttke de [traduction] se d\u00e9barrasser de Loretta parce qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte. Selon Mme Keeper-Anderson, M. Wuttke lui a affirm\u00e9 que le chef Swan lui avait dit de la cong\u00e9dier, mais qu'il avait refus\u00e9 parce qu'il n'avait pas de bonne raison de le faire.\n[21] Le chef Swan ne se souvenait pas de cette r\u00e9union. Toutefois elle se rappelait avoir eu des r\u00e9unions avec Mme McCorrister au sujet du rendement au travail de Mme Keeper-Anderson. Quant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de Mme Keeper-Anderson voulant qu'elle soit cong\u00e9dier parce qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte, le chef Swan affirme que l'all\u00e9gation est ridicule.\n[22] Le chef Swan a sept enfants, est une m\u00e8re seule et a travaill\u00e9 lors de toutes ses grossesses. Elle croit qu'elle s'est montr\u00e9e plus indulgente \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Keeper-Anderson parce qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte et une m\u00e8re seule.\n[23] Selon les souvenirs de Mme McCorrister, la r\u00e9union avait eu lieu \u00e0 la demande du chef Swan. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas satisfaite du progr\u00e8s du programme des SEF. Il y avait eu peu auparavant une conf\u00e9rence de la SCO o\u00f9 Mme Keeper-Anderson \u00e9tait une des participantes. Sa pr\u00e9sentation ne s'est pas bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9e et les chefs ont fait part de nombreuses plaintes \u00e0 son sujet.\n[24] Le chef Swan en \u00e9tait perturb\u00e9e. Elle devait r\u00e9pondre aux chefs du projet des SEF et elle voulait que cela se d\u00e9roule bien. De toute fa\u00e7on, Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e et a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 titre de gestionnaire de projets.\n(iii) Le troisi\u00e8me incident - la f\u00eate de No\u00ebl en d\u00e9cembre 2003 [25] En d\u00e9cembre 2003, la SCO a tenu sa f\u00eate annuelle de No\u00ebl au restaurant Royal Crown \u00e0 Winnipeg. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, Mme Keeper-Anderson \u00e9tait enceinte de quatre mois. Le chef Swan avait l'habitude, lors de la f\u00eate de No\u00ebl, d'inviter chaque employ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avant afin de lui remettre un cadeau de No\u00ebl.\n[26] Quand Mme Keeper-Anderson s'est rendue \u00e0 l'avant, le chef Swan lui aurait dit : [traduction] Je suis \u00e9tonn\u00e9e que vous n'ayez pas encore fait une fausse couche compte tenu de toute la pression que vous avez subie cette ann\u00e9e \u00e0 la Southern Chiefs. Mme Keeper-Anderson soutient qu'elle \u00e9tait visiblement perturb\u00e9e par le commentaire du chef Swan.\n[27] Mme McCorrister a affirm\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait habituel pour le chef Swan de dire quelques mots \u00e0 chaque membre du personnel quand il \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir son cadeau. Mme McCorrister ne se rappelait pas que Mme Keeper-Anderson l'ait approch\u00e9e pour se plaindre du commentaire du chef Swan lors du souper de No\u00ebl ou d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e9crite.\n[28] Le chef Swan ne se souvenait pas exactement de ce qu'elle avait dit \u00e0 Mme Keeper-Anderson, mais elle peut \u00eatre affirm\u00e9e que Mme Keeper-Anderson n'ait pas fait de fausse couche \u00e0 cause de tout le stress que chacun subissait \u00e0 la SCO ou quelque chose du genre.\n[29] Par sa remarque, elle ne voulait pas se montrer m\u00e9prisante ou insultante. Quand elle donnait un cadeau \u00e0 un membre du personnel, elle disait quelque chose de gentil ou parfois quelque chose de dr\u00f4le \u00e0 son sujet, quelque chose pour qu'il se sente bien, et non pour le rendre mal \u00e0 l'aise. Elle formulait un commentaire personnalis\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque employ\u00e9. Elle n'a pas vis\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment Mme Keeper-Anderson.\n[30] Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a jamais dit au chef Swan qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offens\u00e9e par son commentaire. Selon le chef Swan, si elle l'avait fait, elle se serait excus\u00e9e.\n(iv) Le quatri\u00e8me incident - les questions de Del Assiniboine au sujet du cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 de Mme Keeper-Anderson - janvier-f\u00e9vrier 2004 [31] Elva McCorrister est partie en cong\u00e9 de maladie en janvier 2004. Del Assiniboine a pris sa place \u00e0 titre de directeur ex\u00e9cutif par int\u00e9rim. Mme Keeper-Anderson pr\u00e9tend que, \u00e0 au moins trois reprises en janvier et en f\u00e9vrier 2004, M. Assiniboine l'a interrog\u00e9e au sujet des dates pr\u00e9cises auxquelles elle pr\u00e9voyait partir en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et revenir au travail ainsi que si elle allait recommander quelqu'un pour la remplacer pendant son absence.\n[32] Elle a assur\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Assiniboine qu'elle aviserait la SCO suffisamment \u00e0 l'avance avant de prendre son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Elle a recommand\u00e9 Jeff LaPlante, un analyste des politiques qui travaillait avec elle sur le projet et qui pourrait poursuivre le travail sans interruption.\n[33] Mme Keeper-Anderson soutient que ses propos n'ont pas rassur\u00e9 M. Assiniboine. Elle s'est sentie harcel\u00e9e par M. Assiniboine, par ses questions sur la date \u00e0 laquelle elle pr\u00e9voyait prendre son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\n[34] Le poste habituel de M. Assiniboine \u00e0 la SCO \u00e9tait celui d'intervenant en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que, dans leur culture, les autochtones s'inqui\u00e8tent toujours au sujet de leurs b\u00e9b\u00e9s, qu'ils soient n\u00e9s ou non, et que cela se poursuit quand ils grandissent jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils deviennent adultes.\n[35] Quand il est entr\u00e9 en poste, il s'est fait un devoir de rendre visite non seulement \u00e0 Mme Keeper-Anderson, mais \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s du bureau. Il a pass\u00e9 quelques minutes dans le bureau de chacun des membres du personnel, pour leur parler. Selon lui, c'est dans ce contexte qu'il demandait \u00e0 Mme Keeper-Anderson comment elle se sentait, si elle allait bien et quand elle comptait prendre son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\nB. La p\u00e9riode de probation [36] Mme Keeper-Anderson a re\u00e7u une lettre dat\u00e9e du 2 d\u00e9cembre 2002, de Stuart Wuttke, dans laquelle il lui annon\u00e7ait qu'il la pla\u00e7ait en p\u00e9riode de probation du 2 d\u00e9cembre 2002 au 31 mars 2003. Il a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 un certain nombre de raisons expliquant sa d\u00e9cision. Parmi ces raisons, il a nomm\u00e9 son rendement insatisfaisant dans le cadre de la conf\u00e9rence de la SCO qui s'est tenue les 27 et 28 novembre 2002, lors de la pr\u00e9sentation orale de son rapport; le fait qu'elle n'ait pas produit \u00e0 temps des budgets mis \u00e0 jour ainsi que les rapports trimestriels et annuels pour le projet des SEF; son absence lors de r\u00e9unions mensuelles des directeurs des SEF pour le sud du Manitoba; son manque de participation aux r\u00e9unions internes et conjointes concernant les SEF dans le cadre de l'IAC; le fait qu'elle n'agissait pas comme une gestionnaire et son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 g\u00e9rer son personnel. Sa gestion insuffisante du programme et l'incapacit\u00e9 de son \u00e9quipe \u00e0 produire du travail de qualit\u00e9 ont soulev\u00e9 des doutes s\u00e9rieux au sujet de la viabilit\u00e9 du projet.\n[37] M. Wuttke a impos\u00e9 certaines conditions \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de probation, notamment l'obligation pour Mme Keeper-Anderson de se pr\u00e9senter aux r\u00e9unions pr\u00e9vues des directeurs des SEF, la pr\u00e9sentation d'un rapport additionnel sur l'\u00e9tat du projet des SEF ainsi que la remise de tous les rapports sur les collectivit\u00e9s et du rapport global avant le 30 mars 2003.\n[38] Fait int\u00e9ressant, une autre des conditions \u00e9tait que Mme Keeper-Anderson devait assister \u00e0 ses cours de droit \u00e0 un maximum de 1,5 jours par semaine. Mme Keeper-Anderson a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9rout\u00e9e par cette condition parce que M. Wuttke lui disait qu'elle n'arrivait pas \u00e0 s'acquitter de son travail tout en l'obligeant \u00e0 assister \u00e0 des cours de droit pendant 1,5 jour par semaine.\n[39] \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque en 2002, Mme Keeper-Anderson \u00e9tudiait le droit \u00e0 temps partiel et travaillait \u00e0 la SCO. M. Wuttke l'avait encourag\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9tudier le droit et il lui avait assur\u00e9 qu'on l'aiderait \u00e0 s'acquitter de son travail.\n[40] Elle a manqu\u00e9 certaines r\u00e9unions parce qu'elle assistait \u00e0 ses cours de droit. On ne l'aidait pas avec son travail. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9galement critiqu\u00e9e par la haute direction parce qu'elle ne faisait pas son travail.\n[41] Parfois, M. Wuttke lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phonait et l'informait de la tenue d'une r\u00e9union importante \u00e0 laquelle elle devait assister. Cette situation s'est produite de plus en plus fr\u00e9quemment et elle a manqu\u00e9 beaucoup de cours. Elle a donc abandonn\u00e9 ses cours de droit, elle n'a pas termin\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re session et elle est retourn\u00e9e travailler \u00e0 temps plein.\n[42] Mme Keeper-Anderson a refus\u00e9 de signer la lettre par laquelle elle aurait reconnu les conditions de sa p\u00e9riode de probation. Elle affirme avoir discut\u00e9 de la lettre avec M. Wuttke et lui avoir dit que la lettre comportait des exigences contradictoires. Il lui a r\u00e9pondu que la lettre venait d'autorit\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de l'\u00e9crire.\n[43] Mme Keeper-Anderson a affirm\u00e9 avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme McCorrister de sa p\u00e9riode de probation et lui avoir dit qu'elle voulait en appeler. Selon Mme Keeper-Anderson, Mme McCorrister lui a dit qu'elle n'avait pas \u00e0 \u00e9crire de lettre et de ne pas prendre en consid\u00e9ration la lettre de M. Wuttke. Mme Keeper-Anderson a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme McCorrister ce qu'elle voulait dire et Mme McCorrister lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne serait pas plac\u00e9e en p\u00e9riode de probation.\n[44] N\u00e9anmoins, Mme Keeper-Anderson a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme McCorrister le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2002, pour l'informer que, comme elle lui en avait fait part dans leur conversation, elle interjetterait appel par \u00e9crit de sa p\u00e9riode de probation avant le 15 janvier 2003. Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 sa lettre et n'a jamais interjet\u00e9 appel.\n[45] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Keeper-Anderson a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 des \u00e9ch\u00e9ances que lui imposait M. Wuttke. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, le personnel travaillant sur le projet \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 d'elle-m\u00eame et d'une autre personne seulement. Mme Keeper-Anderson a discut\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises avec M. Wuttke et Mme McCorrister des difficult\u00e9s qu'elle \u00e9prouvait \u00e0 terminer les rapports. Elle devait renvoyer les rapports \u00e0 chaque collectivit\u00e9 et \u00e0 chaque personne qu'elle avait interrog\u00e9e pour qu'elles les examinent. Les renseignements recueillis dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9taient en ojibway ou en cri et devaient \u00eatre traduits en anglais.\n[46] En fin de compte, trois traducteurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s pour le projet quelques mois apr\u00e8s la lettre de M. Wuttke. Le rapport global a \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9 en juillet 2003 et les rapports des collectivit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis plus t\u00f4t.\n[47] Il est \u00e0 noter que, le 29 janvier 2003, peu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode de probation de Mme Keeper-Anderson, Dave Rundle, le directeur ex\u00e9cutif des Services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille Anishinaabe pour les trois collectivit\u00e9s de Premi\u00e8res nations du sud du Manitoba, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Marlyn Bennett, coordonnatrice de la recherche, Site de recherche des Premi\u00e8res nations, le 23 janvier 2003.\n[48] Dans sa lettre, M. Rundle recommandait Mme Keeper-Anderson pour le poste de recherchiste principal dans le cadre du projet de recherche sur les enfants et les d\u00e9ficiences au Canada. Il a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 Mme Keeper-Anderson comme la gestionnaire de projets pour le projet de SEF dans le cadre de l'IAC \u00e0 la SCO. Il a soulign\u00e9 que l'une de ses principales t\u00e2ches \u00e9tait de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des consultations aupr\u00e8s des collectivit\u00e9s de Premi\u00e8res nations du sud, ce que Mme Keeper-Anderson avait fait avec succ\u00e8s.\n[49] Mme McCorrister a \u00e9galement \u00e9crit \u00e0 Marlyn Bennett le 21 janvier 2003, pour recommander Mme Keeper-Anderson pour ce poste. Elle a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que Mme Keeper-Anderson s'\u00e9tait bien acquitt\u00e9e des consultations aupr\u00e8s des collectivit\u00e9s pour les SEF dans le cadre de l'IAC pour les Premi\u00e8res nations du sud du Manitoba.\nC. Mme Keeper-Anderson quitte la SCO [50] Le mercredi 11 f\u00e9vrier 2004 \u00e9tait un jour de paye r\u00e9gulier. Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a pas re\u00e7u la sienne. Elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Assiniboine le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004 et lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, il a r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait raison de retenir sa paye parce qu'il avait examin\u00e9 son dossier et avait remarqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e en p\u00e9riode de probation en d\u00e9cembre 2002.\n[51] La version de M. Assiniboine diff\u00e8re quelque peu. Il dit avoir expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Keeper-Anderson que la SCO n'avait pas suffisamment d'argent \u00e0 ce moment pour payer tous les membres de son personnel. La SCO n'avait pas re\u00e7u ses subventions de la MKO. La MKO ne pouvait recevoir son financement de l'AMC parce que la SCO n'avait pas remis \u00e0 temps ses rapports.\n[52] \u00c0 titre de directeur ex\u00e9cutif par int\u00e9rim, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la haute direction ne serait pas pay\u00e9e et que l'argent que la SCO avait en banque la servirait \u00e0 payer les adjoints administratifs. Les personnes qui n'\u00e9taient pas responsables des rapports ou des finances seraient pay\u00e9es en premier.\n[53] Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0, pas plus que le chef Swan ou Mme McCorrister. Cependant, M. Assiniboine a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de faire augmenter la marge de cr\u00e9dit de la SCO et tout le monde a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2004, y compris Mme Keeper-Anderson.\n[54] La version de M. Assiniboine de leur discussion au sujet de sa p\u00e9riode de probation diff\u00e8re \u00e9galement consid\u00e9rablement de celle de Mme Keeper-Anderson. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Steve Clark, le directeur ex\u00e9cutif de la MKO, s'\u00e9tait inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 lors d'une r\u00e9union avec la SCO le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2004 du fait que Mme Keeper-Anderson n'avait pas remis les rapports \u00e0 temps et de son manque de participation aux r\u00e9unions de comit\u00e9 des SEF.\n[55] Apr\u00e8s cette r\u00e9union, M. Assiniboine a examin\u00e9 le dossier de Mme Keeper-Anderson et a remarqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 auparavant plac\u00e9e en p\u00e9riode de probation pour certaines raisons dont plusieurs correspondaient aux inqui\u00e9tudes de M. Clark. Il a \u00e9galement remarqu\u00e9 que Mme Keeper-Anderson n'avait pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 11 f\u00e9vrier 2004 parce qu'elle \u00e9tait trop occup\u00e9e, alors que le chef Swan le lui avait demand\u00e9.\n[56] M. Assiniboine pr\u00e9tend que, durant leur conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, il a abord\u00e9 ces trois questions avec Mme Keeper-Anderson et lui a dit qu'il pensait la mettre encore en p\u00e9riode de probation ou prendre des mesures disciplinaires quelconques. Cela n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec le fait qu'elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e. Sa r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00c7a suffit, je pars.\n[57] Mme Keeper-Anderson convient qu'elle a dit \u00e0 M. Assiniboine \u00e0 la fin de leur conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique : [traduction] Je pars. Mais elle affirme qu'elle n'a pas d\u00e9missionn\u00e9.\n[58] M. Assiniboine a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2004, il a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Gladys Cochrane qui lui a dit que Mme Keeper-Anderson lui avait remis ses cl\u00e9s et son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire et lui avait dit : [traduction] Je d\u00e9missionne.\n[59] Le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2004, M. Assiniboine a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Keeper-Anderson pour lui signaler qu'elle s'\u00e9tait absent\u00e9e du travail sans l'autorisation de son superviseur. Cette absence serait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme un abandon d'emploi si elle continuait \u00e0 s'absenter sans autorisation.\n[60] Il a inclus dans sa lettre un exemplaire de la politique du personnel de la SCO pour qu'elle puisse suivre la proc\u00e9dure en bonne et due forme pour demander un cong\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, si elle ne r\u00e9pondait pas avant le 1er mars 2004, il serait conclu qu'elle avait abandonn\u00e9 son poste et il prendrait les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour embaucher quelqu'un pour doter le poste.\n[61] M. Assiniboine n'est pas certain que cette lettre ait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Keeper-Anderson. Elle affirme ne l'avoir jamais re\u00e7ue.\n[62] Quand Mme McCorrister est revenue de son cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle a appris que Mme Keeper-Anderson ne travaillait plus \u00e0 la SCO. D'apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Cochrane lui a dit que, le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004, Mme Keeper-Anderson lui avait remis ses cl\u00e9s et son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire et lui avait dit qu'elle d\u00e9missionnait.\n[63] Mme Cochrane a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme McCorrister la note de service du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004 qu'elle avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Dans cette note de service, Mme Cochrane a \u00e9crit que Mme Keeper-Anderson avait remis ses cl\u00e9s des bureaux de la SCO, sa vignette de stationnement ainsi que son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire et les chargeurs. Il n'\u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 nulle part dans cette note de service que Mme Keeper-Anderson lui avait dit qu'elle d\u00e9missionnait. Mme Keeper-Anderson a ni\u00e9 avoir affirm\u00e9 cela \u00e0 Mme Cochrane.\n[64] Mme McCorrister a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lors d'un d\u00eener d'adieu qui a eu lieu le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2004 pour d'autres employ\u00e9s quittant la SCO, Mme Keeper-Anderson s'est approch\u00e9e afin de lui donner une caresse. Quand Mme McCorrister lui a demand\u00e9 comment elle se sentait, elle a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 : [traduction] Vous savez que je d\u00e9missionne. Ne savez-vous pas que je d\u00e9missionne?\n[65] Le 22 mars 2004, Mme McCorrister a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Keeper-Anderson pour lui rappeler que la SCO n'avait pas eu de ses nouvelles depuis qu'elle avait remis ses cl\u00e9s et son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire \u00e0 Gladys Cochrane le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004. Elle a fait mention de la politique et des proc\u00e9dures relatives aux cong\u00e9s de la SCO et a fait remarquer que Mme Keeper-Anderson n'avait jamais d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de demande formelle de cong\u00e9 de maladie ou de maternit\u00e9, que ce soit verbalement ou par \u00e9crit. Elle a termin\u00e9 en affirmant que la SCO pr\u00e9sumait qu'elle avait abandonn\u00e9 son poste et que la SCO embaucherait quelqu'un dans un proche avenir. Il est tr\u00e8s curieux que Mme McCorrister ne mentionne nulle part dans sa lettre le fait que Mme Keeper-Anderson lui aurait dit plus d'un mois auparavant qu'elle d\u00e9missionnait.\n[66] Mme McCorrister a expliqu\u00e9 que tous les employ\u00e9s de la SCO ont droit \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance d'orientation. Ils re\u00e7oivent un exemplaire de la politique du personnel de la SCO, dont les r\u00e8gles et proc\u00e9dures applicables aux cong\u00e9s de maladie, aux cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et aux cong\u00e9s parentaux.\n[67] Les cong\u00e9s de maladie de plus de trois jours doivent \u00eatre justifi\u00e9s par une attestation du m\u00e9decin remise au directeur ex\u00e9cutif. Pour les cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9, l'employ\u00e9e doit aviser le directeur ex\u00e9cutif au moins quatre semaines avant le d\u00e9but du cong\u00e9, lequel ne peut commencer plus de onze semaines avant l'accouchement. L'employ\u00e9e doit \u00e9galement fournir une attestation du m\u00e9decin confirmant la grossesse ainsi que la date pr\u00e9vue d'accouchement.\n[68] Pour ce qui est du cong\u00e9 parental, l'employ\u00e9 doit le demander par \u00e9crit au directeur ex\u00e9cutif au moins quatre semaines avant son d\u00e9but. Lorsqu'il quitte la SCO, l'employ\u00e9 doit rendre son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire, les cl\u00e9s du bureau, ainsi que tout autre \u00e9quipement qui appartient \u00e0 la SCO.\n[69] La version des faits de Mme Keeper-Anderson est qu'elle est partie en cong\u00e9 de maladie le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004. Avant de partir ce jour-l\u00e0, elle a remis les cl\u00e9s du bureau, son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire et sa vignette de stationnement \u00e0 Gladys Cochrane, la gestionnaire de bureau de la SCO.\n[70] Mme Keeper-Anderson a reconnu ne pas avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de demande formelle de cong\u00e9 de maladie, de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ou de cong\u00e9 parental. Elle ne l'a pas fait en partie en raison des commentaires formul\u00e9s par le chef Swan lors de la f\u00eate de No\u00ebl. Elle a pris ces mots au pied de la lettre et elle s'est sentie mise sous pression. Elle ne voulait par leur dire qu'elle \u00e9prouvait des complications avec sa grossesse et que la direction utilise la situation contre elle.\n[71] Mme Keeper-Anderson a bel et bien re\u00e7u une attestation de son m\u00e9decin, dat\u00e9e du 13 f\u00e9vrier 2004, dans laquelle il est indiqu\u00e9 que Mme Keeper-Anderson \u00e9tait incapable de travailler pour des raisons de maladie et en raison de sa grossesse. Mme Keeper-Anderson a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 quelqu'un du bureau de l'assurance-emploi qui lui a dit que, si elle voulait obtenir des prestations d'assurance-emploi pendant son cong\u00e9 de maladie et son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, elle devait pr\u00e9senter une attestation du m\u00e9decin ainsi qu'un relev\u00e9 d'emploi.\n[72] Elle a rencontr\u00e9 Bethany Ettawacappo, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque agente des finances de la SCO, et lui a remis l'attestation du m\u00e9decin. Elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Ettawacappo de pr\u00e9parer un relev\u00e9 d'emploi et lui a dit qu'elle reviendrait \u00e0 la SCO \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9.\n[73] Mme Ettawacappo a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le relev\u00e9 dat\u00e9 du 13 f\u00e9vrier 2004. Dans la section des commentaires du relev\u00e9, elle a \u00e9crit : [traduction] 16 - employ\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 de maladie du 16 f\u00e9vrier 2004 au 12 mai 2004, et cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, y compris cong\u00e9 parental, du 13 mai 2004 au 13 mai 2005.\n[74] Mme Ettawacappo a confirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00eatre la personne qui a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le relev\u00e9. Elle a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu'on ne lui avait jamais dit que le relev\u00e9 devait \u00eatre approuv\u00e9 par la direction. Au cours de son emploi \u00e0 la SCO, elle n'a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 que trois relev\u00e9s et il s'agissait de son premier pour cong\u00e9 de maladie. Mme Ettawacappo ne savait pas que la SCO avait une politique sur le personnel. Elle n'\u00e9tait donc pas au courant que, lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 veut prendre un cong\u00e9 prolong\u00e9, il doit le demander par \u00e9crit. Cependant, elle a reconnu qu'il serait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu'un employ\u00e9 aurait probablement \u00e0 le faire.\n[75] Mme Ettawacappo n'a pas dit \u00e0 M. Assiniboine qu'elle avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un relev\u00e9 pour Mme Keeper-Anderson. Elle n'a pas discut\u00e9 de cette question avec Mme McCorrister parce qu'elle a quitt\u00e9 la SCO le 24 f\u00e9vrier 2004, avant le retour au travail de Mme McCorrister.\n[76] Mme Keeper-Anderson a remis le relev\u00e9 et l'attestation du m\u00e9decin \u00e0 l'assurance-emploi et a demand\u00e9 des prestations de maladie et des prestations de maternit\u00e9. Sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e le 8 mars 2004, les prestations de maladie \u00e9tant vers\u00e9es pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 15 f\u00e9vrier 2004 au 4 mai 2004, et subs\u00e9quemment pour 50 semaines de prestations de maternit\u00e9 et de cong\u00e9 parental.\n[77] Pour ce qui est de la lettre de Mme McCorrister du 22 mars 2004, dans laquelle celle-ci affirme que Mme Keeper-Anderson a abandonn\u00e9 son poste, la r\u00e9ponse de Mme Keeper-Anderson est qu'elle avait pris les mesures appropri\u00e9es pour faire savoir \u00e0 la SCO qu'elle partait en cong\u00e9 de maladie, comme elle en avait discut\u00e9 avec Mme Ettawacappo.\n[78] Elle n'a pas abandonn\u00e9 son poste \u00e0 la SCO. Le relev\u00e9 indique clairement qu'elle allait y revenir. Elle n'a pas demand\u00e9 d'indemnit\u00e9 de vacances parce qu'elle avait tout \u00e0 fait l'intention de retourner \u00e0 la SCO. Elle a \u00e9galement ni\u00e9 avoir dit \u00e0 Mme Cochrane qu'elle d\u00e9missionnait.\n[79] Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a pas discut\u00e9 du relev\u00e9 avec M. Wuttke, son superviseur, et ne l'a pas contact\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2004 pour lui dire qu'elle \u00e9tait partie en cong\u00e9 de maladie.\nD. Le deuxi\u00e8me relev\u00e9 [80] Mme Keeper-Anderson a re\u00e7u une lettre de Mme McCorrister dat\u00e9e du 24 ao\u00fbt 2004, qui l'informait que la SCO avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un nouveau relev\u00e9 parce que celui du 13 f\u00e9vrier 2004 \u00e9tait incorrect. Dans le nouveau relev\u00e9, il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit dans la section commentaires : [traduction] E : D\u00e9mission - ne revient pas.\n[81] La SCO n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de l'existence du relev\u00e9 du 13 f\u00e9vrier 2004, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il soit d\u00e9couvert sous une pile de documents en ao\u00fbt 2004 par la nouvelle agente des finances, alors qu'elle faisait le m\u00e9nage du bureau. La SCO a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e qu'un relev\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis quand le bureau d'assurance-emploi a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au sujet des prestations de Mme Keeper-Anderson.\n[82] D'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme McCorrister, la SCO a obtenu des conseils juridiques selon lesquels le premier relev\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 sans la p\u00e9riode de probation de la direction de la SCO par Mme Ettawacappo \u00e0 partir de renseignements fournis par Mme Keeper-Anderson elle-m\u00eame. La SCO a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de pr\u00e9parer un nouveau relev\u00e9 qui pr\u00e9senterait les faits de fa\u00e7on exacte.\n[83] D'apr\u00e8s Mme McCorrister, la SCO d\u00e9livre un relev\u00e9 quand un gestionnaire ou le directeur ex\u00e9cutif informe l'agent des finances qu'un employ\u00e9 quitte la SCO. L'agent des finances d\u00e9tient alors le pouvoir de d\u00e9livrer un relev\u00e9 \u00e9tablissant la raison du d\u00e9part de l'employ\u00e9.\nE. Les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires [84] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la lettre de Mme McCorrister dat\u00e9e du 22 mars 2004, le 29 mars 2004, Mme Keeper-Anderson a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme McCorrister et lui a dit qu'elle n'avait pas abandonn\u00e9 son poste, qu'elle pr\u00e9voyait retourner au travail d\u00e8s que possible et qu'elle n'avait pas demand\u00e9 d'indemnit\u00e9 de vacances parce qu'elle avait tout \u00e0 fait l'intention de retourner au travail \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\n[85] Selon Mme Keeper-Anderson, Mme McCorrister lui a dit qu'elle ne reviendrait pas sur sa d\u00e9cision. Mme Keeper-Anderson a alors retenu les services d'une avocate qui a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la SCO le 28 juin 2004. Son avocate a affirm\u00e9 que, contrairement \u00e0 la position de la SCO, Mme Keeper-Anderson n'avait pas abandonn\u00e9 son travail. Elle \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t partie en cong\u00e9 de maladie en raison de complications d\u00e9coulant de sa grossesse et cela \u00e9tait clairement \u00e9tabli dans le relev\u00e9 du 13 f\u00e9vrier 2004. Son avocate a demand\u00e9 que, conform\u00e9ment au Code des normes d'emploi, Mme Keeper-Anderson soit r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\n[86] La SCO a r\u00e9pondu le 19 ao\u00fbt 2004 par une lettre de son avocat. La position de la SCO \u00e9tait qu'une enqu\u00eate interne avait confirm\u00e9 que Mme Keeper-Anderson avait bel et bien d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004.\n[87] Les faits \u00e0 l'appui de cette conclusion \u00e9taient sa conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec M. Assiniboine le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004, dans laquelle Mme Keeper-Anderson avait affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00c7a suffit. Je pars, et avait raccroch\u00e9.\n[88] De m\u00eame, apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Assiniboine, elle s'est rendue au bureau de Gladys Cochrane et lui a remis ses cl\u00e9s et son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire et a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle d\u00e9missionnait et est sortie du bureau sans autre explication.\n[89] L'avocate de Mme Keeper-Anderson a r\u00e9pondu le 25 ao\u00fbt 2004, en affirmant qu'elle examinait les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la lettre de la SCO. Rien a d\u00e9coul\u00e9 de cet \u00e9change de lettres entre les avocats et Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a entam\u00e9 aucune autre proc\u00e9dure judiciaire.\nIII. LES MOTIFS DE LA D\u00c9CISION A. Le harc\u00e8lement - l'article 14 de la LCDP [90] Depuis un certain temps, la jurisprudence laisse entendre que l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de sexe relatif \u00e0 l'harc\u00e8lement est suffisamment large pour englober toute conduite non sollicit\u00e9e visant le sexe de la victime et empoisonnant l'environnement de travail.\n[91] Le concept principal de harc\u00e8lement vis\u00e9 par l'article 14 de la LCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour la premi\u00e8re fois par la Cour supr\u00eame dans Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re du harc\u00e8lement sexuel est une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui empoisonne le milieu de travail.\n[92] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a davantage d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 ce crit\u00e8re dans Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es), [1999] 3 C.F. 653 (Franke). Dans la d\u00e9cision Franke, la Cour a soulign\u00e9 qu'un acte ou des commentaires doivent \u00eatre de nature sexuelle ou fond\u00e9s sur le sexe. Les types de conduite pouvant \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s de harc\u00e8lement comprennent les insultes d'ordre sexuel, les remarques sexistes ou les commentaires au sujet de l'apparence d'une personne. Ils incluent \u00e9galement les plaisanteries ou les commentaires qui causent un malaise ou de l'embarras.\n[93] La conduite doit \u00eatre importune. L'\u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 examiner est la r\u00e9ponse ou la r\u00e9action de la plaignante au moment de l'incident. La plaignante a-t-elle fait savoir verbalement ou par son comportement que la conduite \u00e9tait importune? La plaignante a-t-elle inform\u00e9 l'employeur de la conduite importune all\u00e9gu\u00e9e? Si la conduite \u00e9tait de nature sexuelle ou fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait importune, il faut pousser l'enqu\u00eate, c'est-\u00e0-dire examiner si la conduite a eu comme cons\u00e9quence d'empoisonner le milieu de travail.\n[94] Cela d\u00e9pend de la persistance et de la gravit\u00e9 de la conduite. Dans Franke, la Cour a statu\u00e9 que plus la conduite \u00e9tait grave, moins l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour prouver le harc\u00e8lement. Moins la conduite est grave, plus la persistance doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e. La Cour a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que, lorsqu'elle examine si la conduite peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de sexuelle ou si elle est suffisamment grave ou persistante pour empoisonner le milieu de travail, la norme de la personne raisonnable s'applique.\n[95] Mme Keeper-Anderson s'appuie sur quatre incidents pour d\u00e9montrer qu'il y a eu violation de l'article 14. Il n'est pas clair si Mme Keeper-Anderson consid\u00e8re l'incident du [traduction] ch\u00e8que de paye comme du harc\u00e8lement ou une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable. \u00c0 mon avis, la fa\u00e7on de le qualifier importe peu. Comme il sera montr\u00e9, je conclus qu'il ne s'agit ni de harc\u00e8lement ni d'une diff\u00e9rence de traitement.\n[96] Examinons donc les quatre incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de harc\u00e8lement. De toute \u00e9vidence, les commentaires du farceur, tels que rapport\u00e9s par Mme Keeper-Anderson, \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur le sexe. Ils faisaient r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au grand nombre d'enfants de Mme Keeper-Anderson, au fait qu'elle les a allait\u00e9s ainsi qu'\u00e0 la grosseur de ses seins.\n[97] Lors du souper, Mme Keeper-Anderson a dit tant \u00e0 la directrice ex\u00e9cutive de la SCO qu'\u00e0 son superviseur qu'elle \u00e9tait offusqu\u00e9e et humili\u00e9e par ces commentaires, que ces commentaires ne tenaient pas compte de la distance qu'elle avait \u00e9tablie entre sa vie professionnelle et sa vie priv\u00e9e et qu'ils \u00e9taient importuns.\n[98] Cependant, je ne suis pas convaincu que la conduite du farceur \u00e9tait assez grave ou assez persistante pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail empoisonn\u00e9 pour Mme Keeper-Anderson. Les commentaires peuvent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 embarrassants ou offensants pour Mme Keeper-Anderson. Il s'agissait d'un incident isol\u00e9. La pr\u00e9sence du farceur n'\u00e9tait rien de plus qu'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement passager. Ce n'est pas devenu un aspect durable de l'emploi de Mme Keeper-Anderson. Il n'y a pas non plus de preuve montrant que cet incident a affect\u00e9 n\u00e9gativement ses conditions de travail \u00e0 la SCO.\n[99] Je qualifierais de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on les remarques formul\u00e9es par le chef Swan lors de la f\u00eate de No\u00ebl de d\u00e9cembre 2003. Les remarques \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur le sexe dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles faisaient allusion \u00e0 la grossesse de Mme Keeper-Anderson. Cette derni\u00e8re a dit qu'elle en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 perturb\u00e9e. Toutefois, tant Mme McCorrister que le chef Swan ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que Mme Keeper-Anderson ne leur avait jamais dit que les commentaires du chef l'avaient offens\u00e9e.\n[100] Encore une fois, il s'agit d'un incident unique. Il s'est produit plus d'un an apr\u00e8s l'incident du farceur. Le chef Swan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'a pas cibl\u00e9 personnellement Mme Keeper-Anderson. Il est tr\u00e8s difficile de conclure que cet incident a eu pour effet d'empoisonner le milieu de travail de Mme Keeper-Anderson.\n[101] Pour ce qui est de la r\u00e9union d'octobre 2003, Mme Keeper-Anderson n'y \u00e9tait pas. Elle n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 comment elle avait appris que le chef Swan voulait la cong\u00e9dier parce qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte. La seule preuve est que M. Wuttke lui aurait expliqu\u00e9 que le chef Swan lui avait dit de la cong\u00e9dier, mais qu'il avait refus\u00e9 parce qu'il n'avait pas de raison de le faire. Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 la SCO.\n[102] Finalement, il y a l'all\u00e9gation voulant que M. Assiniboine lui ait demand\u00e9 plusieurs fois, en janvier et en f\u00e9vrier 2004, quand elle allait prendre son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Assiniboine, il occupait le poste d'intervenant en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 la SCO; il t\u00e9moignait donc d'un int\u00e9r\u00eat sinc\u00e8re dans le bien-\u00eatre de Mme Keeper-Anderson. En tant que directeur ex\u00e9cutif par int\u00e9rim, il aurait \u00e0 savoir quand Mme Keeper-Anderson comptait prendre son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et agir en cons\u00e9quence pour que le projet puisse se poursuivre. Je ne vois pas comment ces questions peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe.\n[103] \u00c0 titre d'observation finale, j'ajoute que ces incidents n'\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9s, \u00e9taient isol\u00e9s et se sont produits sur une p\u00e9riode allant de septembre 2002 \u00e0 janvier 2004. Ils n'\u00e9taient certainement pas persistants.\n[104] Je conclus qu'une personne raisonnable ne consid\u00e9rerait pas, dans ces circonstances, que ces incidents sont suffisamment s\u00e9rieux ou r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs pour empoisonner le milieu de travail de Mme Keeper-Anderson. Cette derni\u00e8re n'a donc pas \u00e9tabli qu'il y a eu violation de l'article 14 de la LCDP.\n[105] Mme Keeper-Anderson a fait mention de la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu'elle a eue avec M. Assiniboine le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004. Elle pr\u00e9tend que M. Assiniboine lui a dit qu'elle n'avait pas re\u00e7u son ch\u00e8que de paye parce qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e en p\u00e9riode de probation en d\u00e9cembre 2002.\n[106] Il n'appara\u00eet pas clairement si Mme Keeper-Anderson all\u00e8gue qu'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement ou diff\u00e9rence de traitement. \u00c0 mon avis, compte tenu des faits, il ne s'agit ni de l'un ni de l'autre. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Assiniboine selon lequel la raison pour laquelle Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e ce jour-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait que la SCO n'avait pas les fonds pour le faire.\n[107] D'autres membres du personnel de la SCO, dont le chef Swan, Mme McCorrister et M. Assiniboine, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s. Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9e personnellement \u00e0 cette occasion. En plus, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e deux jours plus tard, comme les autres.\nB. La fin de son emploi - l'article 7 de la LCDP [108] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la fin de son emploi, Mme Keeper-Anderson a \u00e9tabli \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue qu'il y a eu discrimination au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP. N'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de sa grossesse et de sa maladie li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa grossesse, elle ne se serait pas absent\u00e9e du travail; n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de son absence au travail, la SCO n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis qu'elle avait abandonn\u00e9 son poste. La conclusion de l'abandon a men\u00e9 au refus de continuer \u00e0 l'employer.\n[109] Il incombe maintenant \u00e0 la SCO de fournir une explication raisonnable et non discriminatoire de sa conduite. La SCO a d'abord pr\u00e9tendu que Mme Keeper-Anderson avait abandonn\u00e9 son emploi. Cependant, cette position est devenue ind\u00e9fendable le 29 mars 2004 quand Mme Keeper-Anderson a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour dire sans \u00e9quivoque qu'elle n'avait pas d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste et qu'elle pr\u00e9voyait retourner au travail.\n[110] C'est \u00e0 ce moment qu'a eu lieu le v\u00e9ritable refus de continuer \u00e0 l'employer. \u00c0 ce moment, la position de la SCO \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e non pas sur une th\u00e9orie d'abandon, mais apparemment sur l'omission pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente de Mme Keeper-Anderson d'avertir \u00e0 l'avance de son absence du travail et d'en obtenir l'autorisation pr\u00e9alable. En outre, il semblerait que le refus \u00e9tait \u00e9galement fond\u00e9 sur l'\u00e9coulement du temps, soit un laps de deux mois.\n[111] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la conversation du 29 mars 2004, \u00e9tait-il raisonnable d'invoquer le manquement pr\u00e9alable de Mme Keeper-Anderson \u00e0 la politique sur les cong\u00e9s pour ne plus l'employer? Je ne le crois pas, pour les motifs suivants :\nau moment o\u00f9 la SCO a refus\u00e9 de revenir sur sa d\u00e9cision, elle savait quelle \u00e9tait la v\u00e9ritable intention de Mme Keeper-Anderson, c'est-\u00e0-dire retourner au travail apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9 li\u00e9 \u00e0 sa grossesse; pendant un temps assez long avant le 29 mars 2004, la SCO savait que Mme Keeper-Anderson \u00e9tait enceinte et demanderait un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 bient\u00f4t.\n[112] La SCO n'a pas tent\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir que le respect en temps opportun des politiques sur les cong\u00e9s constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, la seule fa\u00e7on possible de r\u00e9futer la preuve prima facie \u00e9tait de d\u00e9montrer que le refus d'employer n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9 \u00e0 la grossesse de Mme Keeper-Anderson. La SCO a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de le faire.\n[113] \u00c0 partir du 29 mars 2004, la position de l'intim\u00e9e revenait \u00e0 refuser d'accorder r\u00e9troactivement \u00e0 la plaignante le cong\u00e9 li\u00e9 \u00e0 la naissance de son enfant. Encore une fois, bien que ce refus puisse \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement justifi\u00e9 en invoquant l'exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 et la possibilit\u00e9 que quelqu'un ait pu \u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 embauch\u00e9, une telle justification n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[114] En outre, la SCO n'a pas tent\u00e9 de justifier son acte en affirmant que les moyens quelque peu subreptices utilis\u00e9s par Mme Keeper-Anderson pour obtenir un relev\u00e9 sans passer par les voies appropri\u00e9es r\u00e9v\u00e9laient un manque d'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 incompatible avec le maintien de la relation d'emploi.\n[115] Il reste le fait que la SCO, lorsqu'elle a refus\u00e9 de revenir sur sa conclusion d'abandon, l'a fait en connaissant parfaitement les raisons de l'absence de la plaignante, soit sa grossesse, ainsi que son intention de retourner au travail d\u00e8s que possible. Dans ces circonstances, le refus de continuer \u00e0 l'employer \u00e9tait fond\u00e9, du moins en partie, sur le motif de distinction illicite qu'est le sexe. Par cons\u00e9quent, cet aspect de la plainte est fond\u00e9.\nIV. LES MESURES DE REDRESSEMENT [116] Mme Keeper-Anderson a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal lui accorde ce qui suit :\nune indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire pour la p\u00e9riode entre mai 2005 et mai 2007, soit 90 000 $ \u00e0 raison de 45 000 $ par ann\u00e9e; une indemnit\u00e9 pour avantages perdus de 5 000 $; 5 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral; 15 000 $ d'indemnit\u00e9 pour l'acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 de la SCO; les frais engag\u00e9s par la vente de sa maison; les frais juridiques; les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les montants ci-dessus.\n[117] Avant que je puisse d\u00e9cider de la somme que Mme Keeper-Anderson doit recevoir \u00e0 titre de mesure de redressement, je dois conna\u00eetre toutes les sources de revenus de Mme Keeper-Anderson ainsi que le montant de ces revenus de mai 2005 \u00e0 mai 2007, et je dois \u00e9tablir si elle est tenue de rembourser l'assurance-emploi pour certaines prestations ou tout autre organisme gouvernemental pour des prestations d'aide au revenu qu'elle aurait touch\u00e9es pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[118] Mme Keeper-Anderson doit \u00e9galement produire toute facture montrant les frais juridiques engag\u00e9s dans le cadre de sa plainte.\n[119] Mme Keeper-Anderson doit fournir au Tribunal et \u00e0 l'avocat de la SCO ces renseignements d'ici le 15 juillet 2008. Entre-temps, je presse les parties d'essayer de s'entendre sur une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 verser \u00e0 Mme Keeper-Anderson.\n[120] Je demeure saisi de la pr\u00e9sente plainte jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la question du redressement soit finalis\u00e9e.\nJ.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le 19 janvier 2004, Mme Brigitte Lavoie (Mme Lavoie), a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada (l'intim\u00e9), all\u00e9guant le caract\u00e8re discriminatoire en raison du sexe de la nouvelle Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e (la nouvelle politique).\n[2] Mme Lavoie all\u00e8gue que l'alin\u00e9a 7 (2)a) de la nouvelle politique constitue une violation des articles 7, 8 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi), du fait que la dur\u00e9e d'un cong\u00e9 non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ou parental n'est pas comptabilis\u00e9e comme temps de travail dans le calcul des trois ann\u00e9es cumulatives de travail requises pour passer du statut d'employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 celui d'employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e (permanent) dans la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (La Commission) a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience qui s'est tenue \u00e0 Ottawa les 24, 25, 27 et 28 septembre 2007 et du 21 au 25 janvier 2008.\n[4] En raison d'une entente intervenue \u00e0 l'occasion d'une premi\u00e8re plainte de discrimination d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Lavoie le 10 juillet 2007, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que Mme Lavoie ne peut contester la nouvelle politique \u00e0 titre personnel incluant celui de r\u00e9clamer des redressements pour elle-m\u00eame. Pour les motifs mentionn\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision, je rejette ce moyen d'irrecevabilit\u00e9.\n[5] Pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, j'ai conclu que l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 Mme Lavoie en cours d'emploi lorsqu'il a refus\u00e9 de comptabiliser le cong\u00e9 parental dans la d\u00e9termination de son \u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 pour la nomination \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e (article 7 de la Loi). Pour la m\u00eame raison, je conclus que la nouvelle politique a annihil\u00e9 les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement de Mme Lavoie (article 10 de la Loi).\n[6] En ne comptabilisant pas le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ni le cong\u00e9 parental, la nouvelle politique de l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9favorise en cours d'emploi (article 7 de la Loi) les femmes employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui prennent un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et\/ou parental et est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement de ces employ\u00e9es en raison de leur sexe (article 10 de la Loi).\n[7] J'ordonne \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de modifier la nouvelle politique de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9liminer les aspects discriminatoires dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est maintenu une norme selon laquelle la dur\u00e9e des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 ou parental de plus de soixante (60) jours civils cons\u00e9cutifs n'est pas prise en compte dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative pour une nomination \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[8] La plainte de Mme Lavoie est par cons\u00e9quent accueillie.\nII. LES FAITS A. Preuve de la plaignante, Mme Lavoie [9] Historiquement, la Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de longue dur\u00e9e (l'ancienne politique) pr\u00e9voyait le droit \u00e0 la conversion d'un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour toute personne qui avait travaill\u00e9 dans un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour une p\u00e9riode de cinq (5) ann\u00e9es. En vertu de l'ancienne politique, une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9, peu importe la longueur de la p\u00e9riode, \u00e9tait prise en compte dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail de cinq (5) ann\u00e9es.\n[10] \u00c0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e 2002, l'intim\u00e9 a adopt\u00e9 une nouvelle politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e (la nouvelle politique) selon laquelle la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail n\u00e9cessaire pour convertir un poste est dor\u00e9navant de trois (3) ann\u00e9es. Cette nouvelle politique exclut dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail, une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 de plus de soixante (60) jours civils cons\u00e9cutifs.\n[11] En vertu de la nouvelle politique, le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et celui parental sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des cong\u00e9s non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, la dur\u00e9e de ces cong\u00e9s n'est plus prise en compte dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail de trois (3) ann\u00e9es.\n[12] La nouvelle politique est entr\u00e9e en vigueur \u00e0 Industrie Canada le 1er avril 2003 et s'applique de fa\u00e7on imm\u00e9diate aux contrats \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours. Ainsi \u00e0 compter du 1er avril 2003, pour tous les contrats en cours, toute p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 de plus de soixante (60) jours civils cons\u00e9cutifs n'\u00e9tait plus comptabilis\u00e9e dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail de trois (3) ann\u00e9es.\n[13] En application de la nouvelle politique, l'absence de Mme Lavoie en raison d'un cong\u00e9 parental, soit du 1er avril 2003 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de son contrat (5 ao\u00fbt 2003), n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 comptabilis\u00e9e dans la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail de trois (3) ann\u00e9es. Selon Mme Lavoie, si on avait comptabilis\u00e9 la p\u00e9riode d'absence \u00e0 compter du 1er avril 2003, son poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 converti en un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, madame Lavoie aurait obtenu le statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[14] Mme Lavoie a obtenu son premier contrat d'emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du 7 ao\u00fbt 2000 \u00e0 titre de programmeur-analyste \u00e0 l'Office de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle \u00e0 Industrie Canada. Ce contrat d'une dur\u00e9e d'une ann\u00e9e fut successivement renouvel\u00e9 au mois d'ao\u00fbt 2001 et au mois d'ao\u00fbt 2002, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 compter du 5 ao\u00fbt 2002 jusqu'au 5 ao\u00fbt 2003 inclusivement. Aucune interruption de service ne s\u00e9pare les deux renouvellements de contrat.\n[15] Lors d'un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2000, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e dans ses fonctions par son conjoint, lui-m\u00eame employ\u00e9 \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et engag\u00e9 apr\u00e8s Mme Lavoie.\n[16] Sur la nature de son travail au moment de la prise de son cong\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2002, Mme Lavoie d\u00e9clare qu'elle faisait le m\u00eame travail que trois employ\u00e9s masculins \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, une femme employ\u00e9e \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et deux consultants.\n[17] Au d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e 2002, Mme Lavoie annonce \u00e0 ses sup\u00e9rieurs son intention de prendre un deuxi\u00e8me cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Vers le mois d'avril 2002, on l'informe qu'en raison de son absence \u00e9ventuelle, elle allait changer imm\u00e9diatement d'\u00e9quipe, puisqu'on avait besoin d'une personne disponible pour le projet sur lequel elle travaillait. Apr\u00e8s avoir indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle envisageait faire une plainte de discrimination, ses sup\u00e9rieurs se sont ravis\u00e9s, s'excusant de l'imbroglio, l'avisant qu'elle allait continuer dans la m\u00eame \u00e9quipe.\n[18] Le 19 ao\u00fbt 2002, Mme Lavoie a pris un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 se terminant le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2002 (17 semaines) suivi d'un cong\u00e9 parental jusqu'au 19 ao\u00fbt 2003.\n[19] Initialement, Mme Lavoie s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 retourner au travail le 3 mars 2003.\n[20] Le 21 f\u00e9vrier 2003, elle informait par courriel Industrie Canada de son obligation de prolonger son cong\u00e9 parental n'ayant trouv\u00e9 personne pour s'occuper de son enfant et du fait qu'aucune place n'\u00e9tait disponible en garderie avant l'\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[21] Le m\u00eame jour, madame Sylvie Manseau, superviseur imm\u00e9diate, envoyait \u00e0 la plaignante le courriel suivant:\nComme tu comptes prolonger ton cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, je tiens \u00e0 t'aviser que ton poste ne sera pas prolong\u00e9 pass\u00e9 la date du 5 ao\u00fbt 2003. Comme tu le sais d\u00e9j\u00e0, il y a pr\u00e9sentement des concours de CS-02 pour des postes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9s qui sont en cours et, tel que mentionn\u00e9 dans le courriel que je t'ai fait parvenir le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2002, les employ\u00e9(e)s qui ne seront pas nomm\u00e9(e)s dans un de ces postes verront leur terme se terminer \u00e0 la fin du concours.\n[22] Aux termes d'examens et d'entrevue (mars, avril et mai 2003) auxquels Mme Lavoie a particip\u00e9, cette derni\u00e8re est inform\u00e9e en mai 2003 qu'elle a termin\u00e9 derni\u00e8re dans le concours CS-02 soit la huiti\u00e8me pour une possibilit\u00e9 de sept postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Mme Lavoie explique qu'elle s'est class\u00e9e huiti\u00e8me au concours en raison du refus de sa superviseure, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque madame Goulet, de lui permettre de participer gratuitement \u00e0 une formation portant sur une nouvelle m\u00e9thodologie de travail en langage \u00e9lectronique. Cette formation devait se tenir pendant son absence en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Mme Goulet lui a expliqu\u00e9 que si elle souhaitait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cette formation, elle devait en assumer les co\u00fbts personnellement, ce qui selon Mme Lavoie correspondait \u00e0 un montant d'environ 10 000.00$. Mme Lavoie ne pouvait assumer ce co\u00fbt.\n[23] Mme Lavoie sera la seule parmi les huit employ\u00e9(e)s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 son lieu de travail \u00e0 ne pas obtenir de poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Son conjoint sera parmi les sept (7) personnes qui obtiendront un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[24] Le 2 juin 2003, monsieur Marc Lalande, Superviseur, Section de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et avantages sociaux informait Mme Lavoie qu'en application de la convention collective, consid\u00e9rant qu'elle avait prolong\u00e9 son absence au-del\u00e0 du 3 mars 2003 et que son contrat se terminant le 5 ao\u00fbt 2003 ne serait pas renouvel\u00e9, elle devait rembourser \u00e0 Industrie Canada l'indemnit\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 re\u00e7ue en vertu du R\u00e9gime de prestations suppl\u00e9mentaires de ch\u00f4mage (RPSC) soit une somme de 12,897.62$.\n[25] Le 11 juin 2003, Mme Lavoie recevait une lettre de madame Sylvie Manseau, d'Industrie Canada, confirmant que son emploi allait prendre fin le 5 ao\u00fbt 2003.\n[26] Le 2 juin 2003, Mme Lavoie d\u00e9posait un grief contestant le refus d'Industrie Canada de lui verser des indemnit\u00e9s parentales (RPSC) pour la p\u00e9riode de janvier \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 2003.\n[27] Le 10 juillet 2003, Mme Lavoie d\u00e9posait une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e0 l'encontre d'Industrie Canada fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et invoquait les articles 7, 10 et 14 de la Loi.\n[28] Le 18 juillet 2003, Mme Lavoie d\u00e9posait un grief contestant le refus d'Industrie Canada de lui payer l'ajustement r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 (RPSC) suite \u00e0 l'augmentation salariale n\u00e9goci\u00e9e entre le Conseil du tr\u00e9sor et son syndicat, l'Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada.\n[29] Le 30 juillet 2003, une lettre sign\u00e9e par monsieur Mario Blais, conseiller en r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pr\u00e9cisait que Mme Lavoie devait \u00e0 titre de trop-pay\u00e9 d'indemnit\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 (RPSC) un montant brut de 12,899.42$.\n[30] Dans le cadre d'une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation intervenue le 20 octobre 2003, Mme Lavoie et Industrie Canada convenaient de r\u00e9gler la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission le 10 juillet 2003. Il importe de pr\u00e9ciser qu'\u00e0 l'audience, les parties ont renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 toute immunit\u00e9 de divulgation se rattachant \u00e0 l'entente.\n[31] Les principaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de cette entente sont les suivants:\nSans aveu de responsabilit\u00e9 relative \u00e0 la plainte, Industrie Canada accorde \u00e0 Mme Lavoie un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e devant d\u00e9buter le 17 novembre 2003. Mme Lavoie s'engage \u00e0 rembourser les indemnit\u00e9s re\u00e7ues en vertu du RPSC. Mme Lavoie reconna\u00eet que le pr\u00e9sent r\u00e8glement constitue une r\u00e9paration compl\u00e8te et finale des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et d\u00e9charge en cons\u00e9quence, Industrie Canada, de l'ensemble des r\u00e9clamations et des causes d'action d\u00e9coulant des incidents en question. Les griefs d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par Mme Lavoie poursuivaient leur cours normal et n'\u00e9taient pas retir\u00e9s. La plaignante et son syndicat se r\u00e9servent le droit de d\u00e9poser une plainte contre le Secr\u00e9tariat du conseil du tr\u00e9sor relativement \u00e0 sa politique intitul\u00e9e Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[32] La Commission a approuv\u00e9 ce r\u00e8glement le 27 octobre 2003.\n[33] Mme Lavoie a d\u00e9but\u00e9 son nouvel emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e au sein d'Industrie Canada le 17 novembre 2003.\n[34] Le 19 janvier 2004, Mme Lavoie a saisi la Commission d'une nouvelle plainte, cette fois, contre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, all\u00e9guant le caract\u00e8re discriminatoire de la nouvelle politique, r\u00e9clamant des pertes p\u00e9cuniaires d\u00e9coulant des avantages dont elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, en raison, selon Mme Lavoie, de l'application de la nouvelle politique \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[35] \u00c0 l'audience, Mme Lavoie d\u00e9clare que lors de la rencontre de m\u00e9diation, toutes les mesures de redressement d\u00e9coulant de l'application de la nouvelle politique dont sa demande d'abolition de cette derni\u00e8re n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9es.\n[36] Mme Lavoie t\u00e9moigne que les repr\u00e9sentantes d'Industrie Canada n'ont jamais voulu discuter de toutes ses r\u00e9clamations en relation avec l'application de la nouvelle politique, de sorte que seule l'obtention d'un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e fut r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par l'entente.\n[37] \u00c0 l'audience, Mme Lavoie d\u00e9clare que les repr\u00e9sentantes d'Industrie Canada pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ses r\u00e9clamations d\u00e9coulaient de l'application de la nouvelle politique et que seul le Conseil du tr\u00e9sor avait l'autorit\u00e9 pour traiter de ces questions.\n[38] Selon madame Lavoie, c'est dans ce contexte qu'il fut convenu et pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entente qu'elle se r\u00e9servait le droit de d\u00e9poser \u00e0 la Commission une plainte contre le Conseil du tr\u00e9sor contestant la nouvelle politique.\n[39] Suite \u00e0 la perte de son emploi en ao\u00fbt 2002, Mme Lavoie t\u00e9moigne avoir v\u00e9cu sur des pr\u00eats. En raison des dettes accumul\u00e9es, elle a d\u00fb proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une cession de ses biens en 2006. La plaignante s'est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de son conjoint et a vendu sa maison. Elle a, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'entente, rembours\u00e9 les indemnit\u00e9s re\u00e7ues en vertu du RPSC.\n[40] Mme Isabelle P\u00e9trin, agente de relations de travail pour l'Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada, \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente lors de la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation tenue le 20 octobre 2003.\n[41] Madame P\u00e9trin t\u00e9moigne qu'\u00e0 cette s\u00e9ance, les repr\u00e9sentantes d'Industrie Canada ont toujours affirm\u00e9 que tout ce qui concernait la nouvelle politique n'\u00e9tait pas de leur ressort; de sorte qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 du contenu de la plainte de discrimination.\n[42] Selon madame P\u00e9trin, la date du d\u00e9but d'embauche, soit le 17 novembre 2003 \u00e9tait, du point de vue des repr\u00e9sentantes d'Industrie Canada non n\u00e9gociable.\n[43] Avant de d\u00e9clarer sa preuve close, Mme Lavoie a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle incluait dans sa preuve, celle de la Commission.\nB. Preuve de l'intim\u00e9 [44] Madame Lise S\u00e9guin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience.\n[45] En 2002-2003, madame S\u00e9guin agissait comme Gestionnaire des ressources humaines de l'Office de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle \u00e0 Industrie Canada. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, madame S\u00e9guin avait la responsabilit\u00e9 de toutes les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 la Commission \u00e0 l'encontre du minist\u00e8re.\n[46] Madame S\u00e9guin a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation tenue le 20 octobre 2003 \u00e0 titre de conseill\u00e8re aux ressources humaines. \u00c0 cette occasion, elle \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e par madame Agn\u00e8s Lajoie, directrice de l'unit\u00e9 des brevets \u00e0 l'Office de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle.\n[47] Madame S\u00e9guin explique que madame Lavoie a racont\u00e9 son histoire. Par la suite, chacune des parties s'est retir\u00e9e pour discuter. Au retour, madame Agn\u00e8s Lajoie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 offrir un poste permanent \u00e0 Mme Lavoie, \u00e0 savoir un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[48] Madame S\u00e9guin t\u00e9moigne que la date du 17 novembre 2003 s'explique par le fait que la gestion avait pris un risque d'augmenter ses ressources malgr\u00e9 l'absence de besoins op\u00e9rationnels, mais pr\u00e9voyait toutefois le d\u00e9part d'une personne \u00e0 compter du 17 novembre 2003. C'est dans ce contexte que la date du 17 novembre 2003 fut propos\u00e9e.\n[49] Selon madame S\u00e9guin, il n'y a pas eu de discussion par rapport \u00e0 la nouvelle politique, sauf madame P\u00e9trin qui aurait affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, que la nouvelle politique \u00e9tait discriminatoire envers les femmes enceintes.\n[50] Pour madame S\u00e9guin, la nouvelle politique \u00e9tait hors de leur ressort, Industrie Canada n'\u00e9tait pas l'instigateur de cette nouvelle politique, mais plut\u00f4t le Conseil du tr\u00e9sor.\n[51] Madame S\u00e9guin ne souhaitait pas discuter de la nouvelle politique. Au contraire, Industrie Canada se devait d'appliquer la nouvelle politique et c'est ce qu'ils ont fait.\n[52] C'est Mme Lavoie et madame P\u00e9trin qui ont demand\u00e9 de faire pr\u00e9ciser \u00e0 l'entente le droit de d\u00e9poser une plainte contre le Conseil du tr\u00e9sor. Pour madame S\u00e9guin, Mme Lavoie avait le droit de se plaindre sur n'importe quelle politique et cela n'\u00e9tait pas de leur ressort.\n[53] Madame S\u00e9guin pr\u00e9cise qu'il n'est pas dans sa pratique de r\u00e9server une demande d'indemnisation pour un autre minist\u00e8re. Elle n'aurait pas sign\u00e9 une entente de cette envergure l\u00e0, s'il n'existait pas une quittance comme celle mentionn\u00e9e au paragraphe deux (2) de l'entente.\n[54] En contre-interrogatoire, madame S\u00e9guin reconna\u00eet qu'elle ne pouvait pas convenir de mesures de redressement incompatibles avec l'application de la nouvelle politique.\n[55] Madame Ila Murphy, agente principale de projet au Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du tr\u00e9sor a particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration de la nouvelle politique ainsi qu'aux consultations qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 son adoption.\n[56] Madame Murphy explique que l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (AFPC) avait, dans le cadre des n\u00e9gociations collectives \u00e0 l'automne 2001, demand\u00e9 une r\u00e9duction du nombre d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[57] C'est ainsi, qu'en novembre 2001, l'AFPC et l'intim\u00e9 ont convenu de former un comit\u00e9 mixte compos\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants de l'AFPC et de l'intim\u00e9 afin d'\u00e9tudier la situation de l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e dans la fonction publique du Canada.\n[58] Ce comit\u00e9 a conduit des recherches pour identifier les cat\u00e9gories de personnes vis\u00e9es par l'emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au sein de la fonction publique et a consult\u00e9 divers int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, dont les employ\u00e9s et gestionnaires.\n[59] Dans le cadre de son mandat, ce comit\u00e9 a organis\u00e9 des s\u00e9ances de discussion \u00e0 travers le Canada avec des employ\u00e9s engag\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ainsi qu'avec les gestionnaires.\n[60] Un sondage aupr\u00e8s des employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e membres de l'AFPC a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9. Madame Murphy pr\u00e9cise que parmi les mille-deux-cent-cinquante-et-un (1251) employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui ont r\u00e9pondu au sondage, soixante-et-onze pourcent (71%) \u00e9taient des femmes.\n[61] Ce taux de participation est repr\u00e9sentatif du pourcentage de femmes occupant un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au sein de la fonction publique qui, selon le rapport, \u00e9tait de 61% au 31 mars 2002. En septembre 2001, l'\u00e2ge moyen des employ\u00e9s engag\u00e9s pour une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e9tait de quarante-trois (43) ans alors que l'\u00e2ge moyen des employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e9tait de trente-sept (37) ans.\n[62] Le comit\u00e9 mixte a produit un rapport au mois d'ao\u00fbt 2002 dans lequel sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s plusieurs constats dont certains concernent le traitement des employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[63] L'un des principaux constats est celui de la tr\u00e8s grande ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 ressentie par la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e: impossibilit\u00e9 de faire des plans pour l'avenir, difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir des pr\u00eats et des hypoth\u00e8ques, h\u00e9sitations \u00e0 fonder une famille, stress reli\u00e9 aux responsabilit\u00e9s financi\u00e8res, angoisse annuelle \u00e0 chaque renouvellement de contrat.\n[64] Sans constituer une constatation majeure, le rapport note qu'on a suffisamment fait allusion aux emplois \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9s pour des raisons de maternit\u00e9.\n[65] En annexe du rapport sont reproduits les r\u00e9sultats des s\u00e9ances des quatorze groupes de discussion form\u00e9s d'employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, membres de l'AFPC. Les ins\u00e9curit\u00e9s de ces employ\u00e9s sont rapport\u00e9es dont celles de certaines femmes qui craignaient, si elles devenaient enceintes, que leur employeur ne d\u00e9cide d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re occasion de ne pas renouveler leur nomination.\n[66] L'une des principales recommandations est formul\u00e9e comme suit:\nLes employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui sont recrut\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e devraient automatiquement \u00eatre nomm\u00e9s \u00e0 un poste de dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e apr\u00e8s une p\u00e9riode cumulative de deux ann\u00e9es de service, au sein du m\u00eame minist\u00e8re et sans interruption de service de plus de 60 jours civils cons\u00e9cutifs.\n[67] Le rapport recommande une mise en uvre progressive de la r\u00e9duction de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de service soit :\n\u00c0 l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la politique, les employ\u00e9s comptant trois ann\u00e9es de service et plus seraient nomm\u00e9s \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e; Un an suivant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la politique, les employ\u00e9s comptant deux ann\u00e9es de service et plus seraient nomm\u00e9s; Par la suite, les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e seraient nomm\u00e9s \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e au moment o\u00f9 ils auraient accumul\u00e9 les deux ann\u00e9es de service requises.\n[68] Madame Murphy explique \u00e0 l'audience que l'une des pr\u00e9occupations consistait \u00e0 \u00e9viter des r\u00e9ajustements de la main-d'uvre au sein d'un d\u00e9partement. Ainsi, il fallait consid\u00e9rer le risque de se retrouver avec un surplus d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e dans une unit\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, ce qui pourrait conduire \u00e9ventuellement \u00e0 des licenciements d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Or, des licenciements impliquent des co\u00fbts.\n[69] L'int\u00e9r\u00eat public et le fardeau suppl\u00e9mentaire sur les contribuables devaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans le cadre de l'\u00e9laboration d'une nouvelle politique. Il fallait s'assurer que cette nouvelle politique n'impliquerait pas des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 l'\u00c9tat.\n[70] Selon madame Murphy, il s'agissait de trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre un traitement \u00e9quitable pour les employ\u00e9s engag\u00e9s pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et le maintien d'une certaine flexibilit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle requise en faveur des gestionnaires.\n[71] Par la suite, madame Murphy et un coll\u00e8gue, monsieur Andr\u00e9 Carri\u00e8re, ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re \u00e9bauche de politique qui a fait l'objet d'une consultation aupr\u00e8s de syndicats, dont l'AFPC.\n[72] C'est dans cette \u00e9bauche qu'appara\u00eet explicitement l'exclusion des cong\u00e9s sans traitement dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de service. L'\u00e9bauche comportait \u00e9galement un changement par rapport \u00e0 la recommandation faite par le Comit\u00e9 conjoint. Au lieu des deux (2) ann\u00e9es mentionn\u00e9es au rapport, la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail pr\u00e9vue au projet de politique \u00e9tait de trois (3) ann\u00e9es, sans mention d'une mise en uvre progressive comme le pr\u00e9voyait le rapport.\n[73] Madame Murphy explique ce changement au niveau de la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode de service en raison de r\u00e9sistances de la part de gestionnaires qui consid\u00e9raient trop courte la p\u00e9riode de deux (2) ann\u00e9es. Une p\u00e9riode de deux ans pouvait cr\u00e9er le risque d'inciter les gestionnaires \u00e0 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer l'embauche d'employ\u00e9s temporaires. Contrairement aux employ\u00e9s engag\u00e9s pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, les employ\u00e9s temporaires ont moins d'avantages, ne sont pas syndiqu\u00e9s ni \u00e9valu\u00e9s au m\u00e9rite.\n[74] Le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2002, la pr\u00e9sidente du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, l'Honorable Lucienne Robillard, annon\u00e7ait publiquement la nouvelle politique, pr\u00e9cisant dans son communiqu\u00e9 que les administrateurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux des minist\u00e8res disposeront d'une p\u00e9riode du 1er avril 2003 au 1er avril 2004 pour la mettre en uvre.\n[75] Le communiqu\u00e9 r\u00e9sume les changements, dont ceux-ci:\nLe seuil pour qu'un employ\u00e9 recrut\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e soit nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e sera de trois ann\u00e9es de service au m\u00eame minist\u00e8re sans interruption de plus de soixante (60) jours civils cons\u00e9cutifs. Une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 de plus de soixante (60) jours civils cons\u00e9cutifs ne constituera pas une interruption de service, mais elle ne sera pas prise en consid\u00e9ration dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative pour une nomination \u00e0 un poste d'une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[76] Madame Murphy confirme dans son t\u00e9moignage que la nouvelle politique ne fait aucune distinction entre les diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories de cong\u00e9 sans traitement.\n[77] Le Docteur Simon Langlois, professeur titulaire au D\u00e9partement de sociologie de l'Universit\u00e9 Laval a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'expert. Le Dr. Langlois a produit un rapport intitul\u00e9 Les cong\u00e9s parentaux au Canada. Analyse sociologique de tendances.\n[78] Dans un premier temps, le Dr. Langlois dresse un portrait sociologique des tendances en mati\u00e8re de cong\u00e9 parental, soulignant une \u00e9volution \u00e0 la hausse de la prise de cong\u00e9 parental par les hommes. Selon le Dr. Langlois, cette augmentation de la prise de cong\u00e9 parental par les p\u00e8res appara\u00eet \u00eatre en relation avec l'adoption de nouvelles politiques dans le R\u00e9gime d'assurance emploi bonifi\u00e9 en 2001. Le Dr. Langlois rapporte que Statistique Canada qualifie la tendance d'augmentation significative.\n[79] Une enqu\u00eate d\u00e9montre que les hommes ont tendance \u00e0 prendre des cong\u00e9s plus courts, soit en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral moins de six mois. En fait, plus des deux tiers seraient retourn\u00e9s au travail dans le mois suivant l'accouchement ou l'adoption de l'enfant.\n[80] La m\u00eame enqu\u00eate r\u00e9v\u00e8le une volont\u00e9 de la part des parents de prendre des cong\u00e9s plus longs dans un contexte de conditions plus favorables. Le Dr. Langlois souligne que l'adoption du nouveau r\u00e9gime d'assurance parentale au Qu\u00e9bec (RQAP) illustre cette tendance sur le comportement des p\u00e8res. En effet, les hommes repr\u00e9sentent le tiers des prestataires du RQAP d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du programme. Ces r\u00e9sultats sont plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux not\u00e9s par Statistique Canada dans l'ensemble du Canada.\n[81] Reconnaissant que l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre hommes et femmes sur le plan de la prise des cong\u00e9s parentaux ne soit pas parfaitement atteinte, le Dr. Langlois conclut que de plus en plus de p\u00e8res prendront des cong\u00e9s parentaux dans l'avenir.\n[82] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, le Dr. Langlois note une tendance \u00e9mergente consistant \u00e0 vouloir partager les t\u00e2ches et responsabilit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re familiale. La responsabilit\u00e9 traditionnellement d\u00e9volue aux m\u00e8res en raison notamment de normes culturelles contraignantes est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 s'estomper pour donner place \u00e0 un meilleur \u00e9quilibre dans le partage des t\u00e2ches et responsabilit\u00e9s au sein du couple.\n[83] Le Dr. Langlois a analys\u00e9 les statistiques fournies par l'intim\u00e9 concernant la prise de cong\u00e9s non pay\u00e9s de plus de soixante (60) jours au sein des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9. Il est d'avis qu'il n'est pas possible de tirer une conclusion ferme en terme de relation causale entre la prise de cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et parental par les femmes et l'effet de ces cong\u00e9s sur la conversion en poste ind\u00e9termin\u00e9. Le Dr Langlois pr\u00e9cise dans son rapport que, sauf pour l'ann\u00e9e 2003-2004, les statistiques ne d\u00e9montrent pas de mani\u00e8re syst\u00e9mique un effet disproportionn\u00e9 sur les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 terme qui sont des femmes. Enfin, le Dr. Langlois est d'avis que les statistiques ne permettent pas de conclure \u00e0 un effet sur le nombre de femmes ayant acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nC. Preuve de la Commission [84] Le Docteur Jeffrey G. Reitz, professeur de sociologie \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de Toronto a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'expert. Le Dr. Reitz a produit un rapport dans lequel il \u00e9value principalement si les donn\u00e9es statistiques fournies par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de la Commission, r\u00e9v\u00e8lent un effet pr\u00e9judiciable de la nouvelle politique envers les femmes engag\u00e9es \u00e0 des postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au sein de la fonction publique du Canada.\n[85] Dans un premier temps, le Dr. Reitz note qu'il y a plus de femmes parmi les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Plus probablement que les hommes, les femmes deviendront des employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au sein de la fonction publique du Canada. Selon les statistiques fournies par l'intim\u00e9, 59,8% \u00e9taient des femmes en 2003-2004, 59,8% en 2004-2005 et 59,4% en 2005-2006.\n[86] Le Dr. Reitz est d'avis qu'un impact n\u00e9gatif de la nouvelle politique \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des femmes peut \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 sous deux (2) angles:\nEst-ce que les femmes risquent d'\u00eatre plus affect\u00e9es du fait qu'on exclut de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative les absences de plus de soixante (60) jours civils cons\u00e9cutifs? Existe-il une r\u00e9duction du nombre de femmes obtenant une conversion de leur poste ou peut-on constater une plus longue p\u00e9riode n\u00e9cessaire pour les femmes \u00e0 l'obtention d'une conversion de leur poste?\n[87] Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 les statistiques fournies par l'intim\u00e9, le Dr. Reitz conclut que la nouvelle politique a un effet n\u00e9gatif sur les femmes et cr\u00e9e des obstacles \u00e0 leur \u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 devenir des employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[88] Parmi les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, les chiffres r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que les femmes ont tendance \u00e0 prendre des cong\u00e9s de plus de soixante (60) jours cons\u00e9cutifs. Cette diff\u00e9rence entre les sexes s'explique notamment par la maternit\u00e9, mais aussi par une prise de cong\u00e9 parental de longue dur\u00e9e plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e chez les femmes. Enfin, le nombre d'hommes prenant des cong\u00e9s parentaux de moins de soixante (60) jours est sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui des femmes.\n[89] Sur le deuxi\u00e8me aspect de son analyse et bien qu'il soit plus difficile \u00e0 \u00e9valuer en terme de relation causale, le Dr. Reitz observe entre autres, que le pourcentage de femmes qui obtiennent une conversion de poste apr\u00e8s trois ans est plus bas de ce qui serait attendu, consid\u00e9rant qu'il y a plus de femmes au sein des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[90] Par ailleurs, il note qu'un pourcentage plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de femmes obtient leur conversion de poste au bout de sept (7) ann\u00e9es. Pour le Dr. Reitz, ce constat pourrait \u00eatre le r\u00e9sultat de l'application de la nouvelle politique et r\u00e9v\u00e9ler que la prise de cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et\/ou parental de plus de soixante jours retarde significativement plusieurs femmes dans l'acquisition du statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nIII. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [91] Le Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la plainte de Mme Lavoie d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 19 janvier 2004 en raison du r\u00e8glement intervenu dans la plainte ant\u00e9rieure?\n[92] Dans l'affirmative, Mme Lavoie a-t-elle fait l'objet de discrimination en raison du sexe au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi?\n[93] Les dispositions de l'alin\u00e9a 7(2)a) de la nouvelle politique sont-elles discriminatoires envers les femmes en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et\/ou parental en vertu des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi?\nIV. RECEVABILIT\u00c9 DE LA PR\u00c9SENTE PLAINTE [94] L'intim\u00e9 soumet que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Lavoie est irrecevable compte tenu qu'elle a renonc\u00e9, dans le cadre du r\u00e8glement intervenu le 20 octobre 2003, \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer d'autres redressements. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que Mme Lavoie a transig\u00e9 sur tous les aspects de la pr\u00e9sente plainte contre l'intim\u00e9 en acceptant l'entente intervenue le 20 octobre dernier.\n[95] D'entr\u00e9e de jeu, il faut rappeler que madame Karen A. Jensen, membre instructeur de ce Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2007 relativement \u00e0 l'argument d'irrecevabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire (Voir : 2007 TCDP 3).\n[96] Madame Jensen a conclu que la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9 demandant le rejet de la plainte parce que les questions soulev\u00e9es auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es et seraient maintenant sans objet ne pouvait \u00eatre accueillie.\n[97] S'appuyant notamment sur les articles 40 et 53 de la Loi, madame Jensen a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9 au motif que la Loi n'exige pas qu'une plainte vise l'obtention d'une r\u00e9paration individuelle ni que la partie plaignante soit victime des pratiques discriminatoires.\n[98] Deuxi\u00e8mement, madame Jensen \u00e9crit qu'\u00e0 l'occasion du r\u00e8glement intervenu, Mme Lavoie s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de porter plainte contre l'intim\u00e9, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la nouvelle politique. Madame Jensen conclut que le caract\u00e8re discriminatoire de la nouvelle politique n'a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9.\n[99] Enfin, madame Jensen laissait au pr\u00e9sent Tribunal le soin de d\u00e9terminer, dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la plainte s'av\u00e9rait fond\u00e9e, si Mme Lavoie avait le droit de demander des redressements \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement intervenu avec Industrie Canada.\n[100] Dans la pr\u00e9sente instruction, l'intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que Mme Lavoie peut contester la nouvelle politique. Il conteste cependant son droit de la contester sur une base personnelle incluant le droit de r\u00e9clamer des mesures de redressement.\n[101] Pour les raisons ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9es, je conclus que dans tous les cas, Mme Lavoie s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de contester la nouvelle politique \u00e0 titre personnel incluant celui de r\u00e9clamer des mesures de redressement pour elle-m\u00eame. Il importe de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter les principaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de cette entente (Voir : Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 D.C.D.P. No 7, par. 20):\nSans aveu de responsabilit\u00e9 relative \u00e0 la plainte, Industrie Canada accorde \u00e0 Mme Lavoie un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e devant d\u00e9buter le 17 novembre 2003. Mme Lavoie s'engage \u00e0 rembourser les indemnit\u00e9s re\u00e7ues en vertu du RPSC. Mme Lavoie reconna\u00eet que le pr\u00e9sent r\u00e8glement constitue une r\u00e9paration compl\u00e8te et finale des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et d\u00e9charge en cons\u00e9quence, Industrie Canada, de l'ensemble des r\u00e9clamations et des causes d'action d\u00e9coulant des incidents en question. Les griefs d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par Mme Lavoie poursuivaient leur cours normal et n'\u00e9taient pas retir\u00e9s. La plaignante et son syndicat se r\u00e9servent le droit de d\u00e9poser une plainte contre le Secr\u00e9tariat du conseil du tr\u00e9sor relativement \u00e0 sa politique intitul\u00e9e Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[102] On note que l'entente est intervenue entre la plaignante et Industrie Canada et que la renonciation (article 2) vise pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment Industrie Canada. Mme Lavoie s'est express\u00e9ment r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de porter plainte contre l'intim\u00e9, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la nouvelle politique. Mme Lavoie n'a obtenu aucune compensation financi\u00e8re d\u00e9coulant de l'aspect discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la nouvelle politique.\n[103] \u00c0 la lecture de l'entente, je conclus que Mme Lavoie n'a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 contester la politique \u00e0 titre personnel ni \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer des mesures de redressement, dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 sa plainte \u00e9tait accueillie.\n[104] \u00c0 l'audience, les parties m'ont demand\u00e9 de recevoir une preuve testimoniale concernant les discussions intervenues lors de la m\u00e9diation. Selon les parties, l'entente est, \u00e0 sa lecture claire, sans pour autant partager la m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation.\n[105] Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 la preuve testimoniale administr\u00e9e \u00e0 ce titre par Mme Lavoie et l'intim\u00e9, je conclus que les discussions intervenues entre les parties le 20 octobre 2003 confirment que l'entente ne visait qu'\u00e0 r\u00e9gler les demandes qui \u00e9taient du ressort d'Industrie Canada.\n[106] Madame S\u00e9guin confirme le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lavoie et celui de madame P\u00e9trin, selon lesquels il n'y a pas eu de discussion sur la nouvelle politique parce que ce n'\u00e9tait pas de leur ressort, mais celui du Conseil du tr\u00e9sor. Bref, madame S\u00e9guin ne pouvait discuter de l'aspect discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la plaignante ni des mesures de redressement en d\u00e9coulant. C'est dans ce contexte que la plaignante s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de contester la nouvelle politique.\n[107] L'intim\u00e9 soumet \u00e0 l'audience l'argument de l'indivisibilit\u00e9 de la Couronne. Mme Lavoie r\u00e9pond que madame Jensen a d\u00e9j\u00e0 dispos\u00e9 de cette question lors de la premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate. Dans tous les cas, je conclus, qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, Mme Lavoie et Industrie Canada ont convenu de laisser en litige toutes les all\u00e9gations de Mme Lavoie portant sur la nouvelle politique et les mesures de redressement qui en d\u00e9coulaient. Les parties n'ont pas divis\u00e9 la Couronne en deux personnalit\u00e9s juridiques distinctes, mais plut\u00f4t ont scind\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations. Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate en irrecevabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 est rejet\u00e9e (Voir: Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 D.C.D.P. No. 15, par. 143).\nV. CADRE JURIDIQUE [108] L'article 7 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que de refuser de continuer d'employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi pour des raisons fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite dont notamment, le sexe, constitue un acte discriminatoire.\n[109] Selon l'article 10 de la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire, le fait pour un employeur d'\u00e9tablir ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite ou de conclure des ententes sur tout aspect d'un emploi, si ces lignes de conduite ou ces ententes sont fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite et si elles sont susceptibles d'annihiler les chances d'emploi d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus.\n[110] Le fardeau de preuve, dans une affaire comme la pr\u00e9sente, incombe tout d'abord \u00e0 la plaignante, Mme Lavoie et \u00e0 la Commission qui doivent \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. (Voir : Israeli c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Commission de la fonction publique (1983), 4 C.H.R.R.D\/1616,1618; Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029; Premakumar c. Air Canada, D.T. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04; et, Lincoln c. Bay Ferries, [2004] C.A.F. 204).\n[111] Une preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui sont faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, sont compl\u00e8tes et suffisantes pour justifier un verdict favorable \u00e0 la plaignante, en l'absence d'une r\u00e9ponse de la part de l'intim\u00e9. (Voir :Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Etobicoke (Borough), [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 208; Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Lt\u00e9e, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au par. 28).\n[112] Dans l'arr\u00eat Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au par. 22 de la d\u00e9cision), la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cise que pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question de savoir si une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, le Tribunal ne doit pas, \u00e0 ce stade, tenir compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9.\n[113] Une fois que la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir des explications \u00abraisonnables\u00bb ou \u00absatisfaisantes\u00bb quant \u00e0 la pratique par ailleurs discriminatoire (Voir : Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd. (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 23 de la d\u00e9cision; Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2005] C.A.F. 154, aux paragraphes 26 et 27).\n[114] Il faut pr\u00e9ciser que la conduite d'un employeur ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant discriminatoire si celui-ci peut d\u00e9montrer que ses refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (EPJ) (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi). Pour qu'une pratique soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une EPJ, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\n[115] La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse ou l'accouchement constitue de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (paragraphe 3(2) de la Loi et Brooks c. Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1219). L'article 3 (2) vise \u00e9galement la p\u00e9riode qui suit l'accouchement (Voir par exemple: Tomasso c. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 265, par. 117 et 119).\n[116] Dans l'arr\u00eat Janzen c. Platy Entreprises Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, 1279 (j. Dickson), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9fini la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n(...) des pratiques ou des attitudes qui ont pour effet de limiter des conditions d'emploi ou les possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi de certaines employ\u00e9s en raison d'une caract\u00e9ristique pr\u00eat\u00e9e aux personnes de leur sexe.\n[117] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet la difficult\u00e9 de prouver les all\u00e9gations de discrimination par le moyen d'une preuve directe. Il appartient au Tribunal de tenir compte de toutes les circonstances pour \u00e9tablir s'il existe ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit dans la cause Basi (affaire pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) comme de subtiles odeurs de discrimination.\n[118] Pour d\u00e9terminer l'existence d'une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, je dois examiner la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Lavoie en regard de l'effet de la politique sur sa situation personnelle. Je devrai aussi d\u00e9terminer si la nouvelle politique a des effets discriminatoires sur les femmes employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e en raison du sexe. Il importe de pr\u00e9ciser que m\u00eame si la situation personnelle de Mme Lavoie n'\u00e9tablissait pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination, je devrai malgr\u00e9 tout d\u00e9terminer, si la nouvelle politique de l'intim\u00e9 op\u00e8re des distinctions fond\u00e9es sur le sexe.\n[119] \u00c0 l'audience, Mme Lavoie et l'intim\u00e9 n'ont pas fait de repr\u00e9sentations sp\u00e9cifiques en regard de l'article 8 de la Loi. J'en conclus que Mme Lavoie a abandonn\u00e9 cet argument. Par cons\u00e9quent, mon analyse ne portera pas sur une violation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de cet article.\n[120] En l'esp\u00e8ce, Mme Lavoie et la Commission doivent \u00e9tablir:\nL'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 Mme Lavoie en cours d'emploi lorsqu'il a refus\u00e9 de comptabiliser le cong\u00e9 parental dans la d\u00e9termination de son \u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 pour la nomination \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e (article 7 de la Loi). Pour la m\u00eame raison, la nouvelle politique a annihil\u00e9 les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement de Mme Lavoie (article 10 de la Loi). En ne comptabilisant pas le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ni le cong\u00e9 parental, la nouvelle politique de l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9favorise en cours d'emploi (article 7 de la Loi) les femmes employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui prennent un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et\/ou parental et est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement de ces employ\u00e9es en raison de leur sexe (article 10 de la Loi).\n[121] Mme Lavoie all\u00e8gue qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi en raison de l'application de la nouvelle politique pour la raison qu'\u00e0 partir du 1er avril 2003, sa p\u00e9riode d'absence n'\u00e9tait plus comptabilis\u00e9e pour les fins du calcul de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative. Par cons\u00e9quent, il lui manquait quatre (4) mois pour atteindre les trois ann\u00e9es de service continu, ce qui l'a priv\u00e9 du droit de devenir une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[122] L'intim\u00e9 soutient que l'ensemble de la preuve soumise par Mme Lavoie et la Commission n'est pas suffisant pour conclure \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination pour les raisons que je r\u00e9sumerai comme suit :\nL'alin\u00e9a 7(2)a) de la nouvelle politique s'applique \u00e0 toutes les personnes qui sont en cong\u00e9 sans traitement, dont celles en cong\u00e9 de maladie ou d'invalidit\u00e9, en cong\u00e9 pour \u00e9tudes, pr\u00eat de service, cong\u00e9s pour obligations personnelles, etc. Par cons\u00e9quent, ce ne sont pas que les cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et celui parental qui sont vis\u00e9s par la nouvelle politique. Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que Mme Lavoie ainsi que toutes les femmes employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e prenant des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et\/ou parentaux doivent \u00eatre compar\u00e9es aux autres employ\u00e9s qui sont en cong\u00e9 sans traitement; Les hommes et les femmes sont \u00e9galement vis\u00e9s par l'alin\u00e9a 7(2)a) puisque, par exemple, autant les hommes que les femmes peuvent prendre un cong\u00e9 parental, de maladie ou d'invalidit\u00e9. D\u00e8s qu'une mesure affecte autant les hommes que les femmes de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, ce qui serait le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce, cette mesure ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme discriminatoire du simple fait que plus de femmes que d'hommes risquent d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9es par cette mesure; Seule une mesure qui aurait un effet disproportionn\u00e9 sur les personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin pourrait \u00eatre jug\u00e9e discriminatoire en raison du sexe.\n[123] Pour les raisons ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9nonc\u00e9es, je conclus que la plaignante, Mme Lavoie et la Commission ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\nVI. ANALYSE A. Preuve prima facie de discrimination (i) Les faits particuliers \u00e0 Mme Lavoie [124] Mme Lavoie a obtenu son premier contrat d'emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au mois d'ao\u00fbt 2000 \u00e0 titre de programmeur-analyste aupr\u00e8s d'Industrie Canada. Ce contrat d'une dur\u00e9e d'une ann\u00e9e fut successivement renouvel\u00e9 au mois d'ao\u00fbt 2001 et au mois d'ao\u00fbt 2002. Aucune interruption de service ne s\u00e9pare les renouvellements de contrats. Je souscris \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de Mme Lavoie qu'elle avait acquis les trois ann\u00e9es cumulatives de travail au 5 ao\u00fbt 2003.\n[125] La preuve de Mme Lavoie r\u00e9v\u00e8le que madame Manseau lui a indiqu\u00e9 qu'en raison de la prolongation de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, elle tenait \u00e0 l'aviser que son contrat d'emploi ne serait pas prolong\u00e9 au-del\u00e0 du 5 ao\u00fbt 2003. C'est donc qu'il existait un besoin jusqu'au 5 ao\u00fbt. Je note par ailleurs que ce courriel ne fait aucunement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la disponibilit\u00e9 du travail et \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e des fonctions \u00e0 \u00eatre accomplie. Au contraire, on y pr\u00e9cise que des concours sont ouverts pour combler des postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'en conclus que les besoins pour lesquels la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e existaient jusqu'au 5 ao\u00fbt 2003 et continueraient d'exister au-del\u00e0 de cette date.\n[126] Je retiens \u00e9galement de la preuve qu'avant son d\u00e9part pour son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, sa non-disponibilit\u00e9 \u00e9ventuelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question \u00e0 tel point qu'on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de la changer d'\u00e9quipe. Certes, les superviseurs se sont ravis\u00e9s, mais on ne peut ignorer que la disponibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante en raison de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 annonc\u00e9 pr\u00e9occupait les repr\u00e9sentants d'Industrie Canada. Enfin, le refus d'accommoder Mme Lavoie en lui refusant la possibilit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 la formation, sauf si elle assumait les frais me semble renforcer l'id\u00e9e que le d\u00e9part de Mme Lavoie pour un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ne semblait pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9.\n[127] Mme Lavoie a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'avant son d\u00e9part pour le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 en 2002, elle effectuait le m\u00eame travail que les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[128] Tel que mentionn\u00e9 ci-haut, au cours de la p\u00e9riode entourant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la nouvelle politique, on a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des concours afin de combler sept (7) postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Ces postes furent combl\u00e9s, dont l'un par le conjoint de Mme Lavoie.\n[129] De ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus qu'il existait en tout temps pertinent un besoin permanent pour le poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de programmeur-analyste pour lequel la plaignante avait un contrat se terminant le 5 ao\u00fbt 2003 et que ce besoin existait au-del\u00e0 du 5 ao\u00fbt 2003.\n[130] La preuve de Mme Lavoie \u00e9tablit que n'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'application de la nouvelle politique, soit la non-comptabilisation de la dur\u00e9e du cong\u00e9 parental, Mme Lavoie aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e employ\u00e9e pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du 6 ao\u00fbt 2003. La prochaine \u00e9tape consiste \u00e0 examiner la nouvelle politique.\n(ii) La nouvelle politique [131] Tel que d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de longue dur\u00e9e (l'ancienne politique) pr\u00e9voyait le droit \u00e0 la conversion d'un poste pour toute personne qui avait travaill\u00e9 dans un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour une p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail de cinq (5) ann\u00e9es. En vertu de l'ancienne politique, une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e9tait prise en compte dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail de cinq (5) ann\u00e9es.\n[132] Selon la nouvelle politique entr\u00e9e en vigueur \u00e0 Industrie Canada le 1er avril 2003, la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail pour convertir un poste d'emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 celle ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e est maintenant de trois (3) ann\u00e9es. Cette nouvelle politique exclut dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail, une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[133] Les cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et les cong\u00e9s parentaux sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des cong\u00e9s non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l'alin\u00e9a 7 (2) (a) se lit comme suit:\nPour \u00e9tablir si l'emploi pendant une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au sein d'un m\u00eame minist\u00e8re ou organisme peut \u00eatre comptabilis\u00e9 comme faisant partie de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative, les minist\u00e8res ou organismes doivent appliquer les r\u00e8gles suivantes :\na) Une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 de plus de soixante (60) jours civils cons\u00e9cutifs ne constitue pas une interruption de service, et elle ne sera pas prise en compte dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative pour une nomination \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e aux termes de la pr\u00e9sente politique;\n[134] Mme Lavoie et la Commission soumettent que cet alin\u00e9a a un effet discriminatoire sur la plaignante et toutes les femmes employ\u00e9es \u00e0 des postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e prenant un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et\/ou parental.\n[135] Mme Lavoie avait droit \u00e0 dix-sept semaines de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et trente-sept (37) semaines \u00e0 titre de cong\u00e9 parental. Dans les faits, la p\u00e9riode d'absence de la plaignante a co\u00efncid\u00e9 avec celle pendant laquelle elle pouvait recevoir des prestations d'assurance-emploi soit dix-sept (17) semaines \u00e0 titre de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, deux (2) semaines de d\u00e9lai de carence et trente-sept (37) semaines \u00e0 titre de cong\u00e9 parental.\n[136] Afin de d\u00e9cider s'il existe une preuve prima facie de discrimination en raison du sexe, je dois d\u00e9terminer dans un premier temps, l'objet du r\u00e9gime qui conf\u00e8re l'avantage ou le droit en cause (Voir: Battlefords and District Co-op\u00e9rative Ltd. c. Gibbs, [1996] 3 R.C.S. 566, par. 33).\n[137] L'objectif de la nouvelle politique consiste \u00e0 maintenir l'\u00e9quilibre entre le traitement des employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une flexibilit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle. L'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de politique pr\u00e9cise que le recours \u00e0 l'emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un besoin continu.\n[138] Dans le but de rencontrer cet objectif, l'intim\u00e9 a convenu de reconna\u00eetre aux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui ont compl\u00e9t\u00e9 une p\u00e9riode cumulative de trois (3) ann\u00e9es sans interruption de service de plus de soixante (60) jours civils cons\u00e9cutifs, le droit d'\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 employ\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e au niveau \u00e9gal \u00e0 son poste d'attache. Pour les fins de l'analyse, je qualifierai le droit d'\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 employ\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de droit \u00e0 la conversion.\n[139] C'est ce droit \u00e0 la conversion dont il est question dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. En mati\u00e8re de discrimination, il faut distinguer les droits d\u00e9coulant des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices compensatoires de ceux que l'on qualifie de non compensatoires, c'est-\u00e0-dire ceux qui se rapportent au statut de l'employ\u00e9. Ainsi, une prime au bilinguisme conditionnelle \u00e0 une prestation de travail fait partie de la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie. La prestation de travail est requise pour obtenir la prime. L'accumulation de l'anciennet\u00e9, le droit \u00e0 l'emploi, le droit de maintenir son emploi, le droit \u00e0 la permanence sont des avantages dits non compensatoires et se rapportent au statut de l'employ\u00e9. Cette deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie sous-tend que la prestation de travail n'est pas requise pour acqu\u00e9rir ou maintenir le droit. Ainsi, on parle d'un avantage ou d'un droit d\u00e9coulant du statut d'employ\u00e9. (Voir principalement: Ontario Nurses Association c. Orillia Soldiers Memorial Hospital (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 692, par. 63, 70 et 71, appliquant le m\u00eame crit\u00e8re: Fernandes c. IKEA Canada, (2007) BCHRTD. No. 259, par. 24, 25, 26, 27 et 31).\n[140] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le droit \u00e0 la conversion fait partie de la deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie. Il est intrins\u00e8quement li\u00e9 au statut de l'employ\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, cela implique que Mme Lavoie et les autres femmes employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui prennent un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et\/ou parental doivent \u00eatre compar\u00e9es \u00e0 l'ensemble des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui ne se sont pas absent\u00e9s plus de soixante jours cons\u00e9cutifs. (Voir: Ontario Nurses Association v. Orillia Soldiers Memorial Hospital, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 63,70 et 71).\n[141] L'intim\u00e9 a soumis que le groupe comparatif pertinent \u00e9tait tous les employ\u00e9s en cong\u00e9 sans traitement. En cons\u00e9quence, je ne pouvais conclure \u00e0 une preuve prima facie de discrimination puisque tous les employ\u00e9s de cette cat\u00e9gorie \u00e9taient trait\u00e9s \u00e9galement. (Voir : Bernatchez c. La Romaine (Conseil des Montagnais), 2006 TCDP 37 et Dumont-Ferlatte c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'Immigration), 1996 D.C.D.P., No 9). Dans ces deux d\u00e9cisions, les plaignantes r\u00e9clamaient des avantages dits compensatoires, c'est-\u00e0-dire ceux que j'ai qualifi\u00e9s de la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie. Ainsi, dans l'affaire Bernatchez, la plaignante contestait le fait que son employeur ne calculait pas les prestations suppl\u00e9mentaires de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 sur la base de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle des personnes qui avaient fourni une prestation de travail. L'indemnit\u00e9 dont il \u00e9tait question \u00e9tait un avantage reconnu aux employ\u00e9es en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et ne constituait pas de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante devait \u00eatre compar\u00e9e aux personnes en cong\u00e9 sans traitement. Dans l'affaire Dumont-Ferlatte, les plaignantes all\u00e9guaient qu'il \u00e9tait discriminatoire de priver la femme en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 du cumul des cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s annuels et de cong\u00e9 de maladie et du droit de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une prime mensuelle au bilinguisme. Encore une fois, les droits dont ils \u00e9taient question sont des avantages dits compensatoires.\n[142] L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement cit\u00e9 l'affaire Cramm (Voir : Cramm c. Compagnie des chemins de fer Nationaux du Canada, 1998 IIJCan 2938 T.A.D.P. et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Compagnie des chemins de fer Nationaux (re Cramm), (2000) IIJCan 15544 (C.F., Juge MacKay). Contrairement \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Ontario Nurses Association, je note que dans l'affaire Cramm, le d\u00e9bat porte principalement sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une prestation de travail. Le Tribunal ne qualifie pas la nature du droit r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par monsieur Cramm. Autrement dit, s'agissait-il pour le Tribunal d'appel, d'un droit de la premi\u00e8re ou de la deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie? Je suis d'avis que cette question est fondamentale puisque la r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9termine l'identification du groupe comparatif. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, je consid\u00e8re que le droit \u00e0 la conversion fait partie de la deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie. Pour les raisons exprim\u00e9es aux paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, je conclus que le groupe comparatif est celui des employ\u00e9s qui ne s'absente pas plus de soixante jours cons\u00e9cutifs.\n[143] Je dois souligner qu'il n'est pas toujours n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer un groupe comparatif. En l'esp\u00e8ce, je suis d'avis que pour le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, la d\u00e9termination d'un groupe comparatif me semble inutile puisque seules les femmes prennent des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9. \u00c0 ce titre, je souscris aux propos de la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans l'affaire Commission des \u00e9coles catholiques du Qu\u00e9bec c. Gobeil, (Voir: [1999] R.J.Q. 1883 (Juge Robert)) o\u00f9 la Cour statuait que le fait pour une commission scolaire de refuser d'embaucher une enseignante \u00e0 temps partiel, non disponible en raison de sa grossesse, \u00e9tait discriminatoire:\nLes femmes enceintes, si ce n'\u00e9tait de leur \u00e9tat de grossesse, seraient disponibles. Pour cette raison, je ne peux adh\u00e9rer \u00e0 une analyse comparative qui les assimilerait \u00e0 des personnes non disponibles afin de d\u00e9terminer s'il y a distinction ou non. Une r\u00e8gle qui a pour effet de priver du droit \u00e0 l'embauche des femmes enceintes qui autrement y auraient acc\u00e8s viole n\u00e9cessairement le droit \u00e0 la pleine \u00e9galit\u00e9. La distinction que cr\u00e9e la clause de disponibilit\u00e9 na\u00eet du fait que l'accouchement et le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 emp\u00eachent les femmes d'obtenir le contrat auquel elles auraient droit. (Mes italiques)\n[144] \u00c0 sa face m\u00eame, l'exclusion des absences pour cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 de plus de soixante (60) jours cons\u00e9cutifs dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative, d\u00e9favorise en cours d'emploi les employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui exercent leur droit \u00e0 ces cong\u00e9s (article 7) et est susceptible d'annihiler leur chance d'emploi ou d'avancement (article 10). Pour reprendre la formulation utilis\u00e9e par la Cour d'appel dans l'arr\u00eat Gobeil (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9), le lien entre une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et la non-comptabilisation de la p\u00e9riode du cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 se constate de lui-m\u00eame. En effet, seules les femmes prennent des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9. De plus, lorsqu'une femme prend un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 de dix-sept (17) semaines, dur\u00e9e du cong\u00e9 reconnu pour les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, son absence d\u00e9passe n\u00e9cessairement les soixante (60) jours civils. Il en r\u00e9sulte pour la femme qui prend un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, une prolongation du d\u00e9lai d'acquisition du droit \u00e0 la conversion du poste et risque m\u00eame, de la priver de ce droit, si le contrat \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e n'est pas renouvel\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 lui permettre de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la p\u00e9riode non comptabilis\u00e9e. Cela est suffisant en soi pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination en raison du sexe.\n[145] Pour le cong\u00e9 parental, la preuve prima facie doit comprendre la d\u00e9monstration d'un effet n\u00e9gatif disproportionn\u00e9 sur les femmes puisque le cong\u00e9 parental s'adresse autant aux hommes qu'aux femmes. Pour cette raison, je dois examiner la preuve statistique (Voir: Walden c. Canada (Social Development), (2007) CHRD no. 54, par. 39, 40 et 41, Premakumar, affaire pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 80).\n[146] Mme Lavoie et la Commission soumettent que les donn\u00e9es statistiques d\u00e9montrent clairement que ce sont les femmes qui prennent majoritairement un cong\u00e9 parental de plus de soixante jours cons\u00e9cutifs. Mme Lavoie et la Commission s'appuient sur le tableau 12 j (Octobre 2007), principalement sur les chiffres pour l'ann\u00e9e 2003-2004. Pour cette p\u00e9riode, 204 femmes ont pris un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et 164 un cong\u00e9 parental dans les 52 semaines suivant la naissance ou l'adoption d'un enfant. Par ailleurs, on note que 49 hommes ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'un cong\u00e9 parental pour la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. En 2004-2005, 151 femmes ont pris un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, 169 femmes et 38 hommes ont pris un cong\u00e9 parental. Pour 2005-2006, 141 femmes ont pris un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, 136 femmes et 36 hommes le cong\u00e9 parental. Pour les m\u00eames p\u00e9riodes, le tableau 12 d (Octobre 2007) r\u00e9v\u00e8le que les hommes sont majoritairement plus nombreux \u00e0 prendre des cong\u00e9s parentaux de moins de 60 jours.\n[147] Outre le fait qu'on constate que les donn\u00e9es fournies par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de la Commission, indiquent qu'en 2003-2004, un homme aurait pris un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, je suis d'avis que ces chiffres sont fiables. Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 selon laquelle, les statistiques manquent de fiabilit\u00e9. Ces chiffres d\u00e9montrent une preuve suffisante d'un effet n\u00e9gatif disproportionn\u00e9 de la nouvelle politique sur les femmes qui prennent un cong\u00e9 parental. En effet, il est manifeste que plus de femmes que d'hommes prennent des cong\u00e9s parentaux de plus de soixante (60) jours cons\u00e9cutifs. En 2003-2004, soixante-dix-sept pourcent (77%) des personnes qui prenaient un cong\u00e9 parental de plus de soixante (60) jours cons\u00e9cutifs \u00e9taient des femmes. C'est une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 statistique que je ne peux ignorer. \u00c0 l'instar de Mme Lavoie, il ne faut pas oublier que les femmes qui ont pris un cong\u00e9 parental suite \u00e0 la naissance d'un enfant ont \u00e9galement pris un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Or, l'homme n'est pas susceptible de prendre les deux cong\u00e9s. Comme la femme qui prend un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, celle qui prend un cong\u00e9 parental retarde le d\u00e9lai d'acquisition du droit \u00e0 la conversion du poste et la prive de ce droit, si le contrat \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e n'est pas renouvel\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 lui permettre de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la p\u00e9riode non comptabilis\u00e9e. Dans le cas de Mme Lavoie, cela a clairement eu pour effet de la priver du droit \u00e0 la conversion de son poste.\n[148] Dans l'analyse de la preuve prima facie, je consid\u00e8re aussi le t\u00e9moignage de l'expert de la Commission, le Dr. Reitz dont les conclusions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 relat\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Rappelons que le Dr. Reitz conclut, \u00e0 l'analyse des statistiques, que la nouvelle politique a un effet n\u00e9gatif sur les femmes et cr\u00e9e des obstacles \u00e0 leur \u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 devenir des employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e et que certains chiffres semblent d\u00e9montrer que la nouvelle politique retarde significativement plusieurs femmes dans l'acquisition du statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[149] Certes, je note que certaines donn\u00e9es statistiques sur le d\u00e9lai d'obtention par les femmes d'un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e incluent les situations de conversion de poste, mais aussi celles o\u00f9 la personne obtient un poste permanent \u00e0 travers un concours. Comme les chiffres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits de consentement, des explications relatives \u00e0 certains d'entre eux auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 souhaitables.\n[150] Cela dit, je suis d'avis que je dois prendre en consid\u00e9ration toutes les circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer si une preuve prima facie de discrimination est \u00e9tablie (Voir : Premakumar, par. 80 et 81). Comme je l'ai soulign\u00e9, une preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui sont faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, sont compl\u00e8tes et suffisantes pour justifier un verdict favorable \u00e0 la plaignante, en l'absence d'une r\u00e9ponse de la part de l'intim\u00e9. (Voir : Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Etobicoke (Borough), [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 208; Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Lt\u00e9e, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au par. 28).\n[151] L'intim\u00e9 soumet que le Tribunal d'appel dans l'affaire Cramm (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9) a conclu qu'une preuve quantitative est insuffisante pour conclure que plus de femmes que d'hommes subissent des effets pr\u00e9judiciables. Dans un premier temps, je note que le Tribunal d'appel a \u00e9mis ces commentaires apr\u00e8s avoir conclu qu'il devait comparer les autres employ\u00e9s absents du travail pour cause de maladie ou de blessure au traitement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s absents du travail pour d'autres motifs. En l'esp\u00e8ce, j'ai rejet\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 selon laquelle le groupe comparatif \u00e9tait tous les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 sans traitement. Je n'ai donc pas \u00e0 m'interroger si les femmes prenant des cong\u00e9s parentaux sont plus d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es que les autres personnes en cong\u00e9 sans traitement. Dans le cadre d'\u00e9tablir l'existence ou non d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination, je peux utiliser la preuve statistique pour d\u00e9terminer s'il existe une preuve suffisante. Or, les donn\u00e9es statistiques soumises en l'esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9montrent clairement que contrairement aux hommes, une majorit\u00e9 substantielle de femmes prennent des cong\u00e9s parentaux de plus de soixante (60) jours cons\u00e9cutifs. Ce qu'indiquent les chiffres, c'est une preuve prima facie d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable disproportionn\u00e9 de la politique \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des femmes qui prennent un cong\u00e9 parental.\n[152] De la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, je conclus que le refus de comptabiliser le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et\/ou le cong\u00e9 parental, \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination en d\u00e9favorisant en cours d'emploi (article 7 de la Loi) les femmes employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui prennent un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et\/ou parental. Ce refus de comptabiliser \u00e9tablit \u00e9galement une preuve prima facie de discrimination sur la base de l'article 10 de la Loi, \u00e9tant susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement de ces employ\u00e9es en raison de leur sexe (article 10 de la Loi).\n[153] Enfin, dans le cas de Mme Lavoie, je conclus que le refus de comptabiliser sa p\u00e9riode d'absence pour cong\u00e9 parental, \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination en la d\u00e9favorisant en cours d'emploi en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi et en la privant de l'acquisition du statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, ce qui selon les termes de l'article 10 de la Loi, a annihil\u00e9 ses chances d'emploi ou d'avancement.\n[154] En conclusion, l'ensemble de la preuve soumise par Mme Lavoie et la Commission \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination en violation des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi. (Voir : Premakumar, par. 80 et 81).\n[155] \u00c0 l'audience, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que la plainte aurait pu aussi \u00eatre examin\u00e9e sous le motif de discrimination en raison de la situation de famille. Toutefois, la plainte vise exclusivement la discrimination en raison du sexe et les observations \u00e0 l'audience ont port\u00e9 sur la proposition selon laquelle la conduite discriminatoire \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne formulerai aucune conclusion sur le motif de discrimination en raison de la situation de famille.\nB. L'intim\u00e9 a-t-il fourni une explication raisonnable? [156] Tel que mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, une fois la preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de donner une explication raisonnable. En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer que le refus de comptabiliser la p\u00e9riode d'absence d'une dur\u00e9e de plus de soixante (60) jours cons\u00e9cutifs, en raison d'un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ou parental est fond\u00e9 sur une EPJ (article 15 (1)a) de la Loi). \u00c0 cette fin, l'intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer que la comptabilisation de ces absences pour les fins du droit \u00e0 la conversion du poste constitue pour l'intim\u00e9 une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi.). Avant d'entreprendre cette analyse, j'aborderai la preuve soumise par l'intim\u00e9 au sujet des tendances en mati\u00e8re de cong\u00e9 parental et par la suite, l'argument de l'intim\u00e9 sur la preuve statistique soumise \u00e0 l'audience.\n(i) Les tendances en mati\u00e8re de cong\u00e9 parental [157] L'intim\u00e9 soutient que dans mon analyse, je dois consid\u00e9rer que de plus en plus d'hommes prennent un cong\u00e9 parental. L'expert de l'intim\u00e9, le Dr. Langlois a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 d'une tendance \u00e9mergente en cette mati\u00e8re. Au Canada, le Dr. Langlois est d'avis que les normes culturelles contraignantes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des femmes semblent diminuer ce qui augmenterait le nombre de p\u00e8res prenant des cong\u00e9s parentaux d'une plus longue dur\u00e9e, et ce, en partie ou en totalit\u00e9 \u00e0 la place de la m\u00e8re. Cela dit, cette tendance ne signifie pas que les hommes prennent des cong\u00e9s parentaux dans la m\u00eame proportion que les femmes et pour la m\u00eame dur\u00e9e. Ainsi, le Dr. Langlois souligne qu'au Canada, une enqu\u00eate d\u00e9montre que plus des deux tiers des hommes seraient retourn\u00e9s au travail dans le mois suivant l'accouchement ou l'adoption de l'enfant.\n[158] Pour les cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9, cette nouvelle tendance n'est d'aucune utilit\u00e9 en raison de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 biologique associ\u00e9e \u00e0 la naissance d'un enfant, y compris les composantes physiologiques et psychologiques pour la m\u00e8re reli\u00e9es \u00e0 la grossesse et au fait de donner naissance \u00e0 un enfant. (Voir: Tomasso c. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 265, par. 117 et 119).\n[159] Je dois pr\u00e9ciser que le droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 de Mme Lavoie et des autres employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e prenant des cong\u00e9s parentaux, doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 dans l'imm\u00e9diat en fonction de la preuve soumise. Il ne peut se d\u00e9duire d'une tendance, ni \u00eatre diff\u00e9r\u00e9 en raison d'une tendance.\n(ii) Preuve statistique soumise \u00e0 l'audience [160] Bien que je consid\u00e8re que cet aspect doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9 dans le cadre de l'analyse portant sur la preuve prima facie, ce qui fut fait, j'ajouterai quelques commentaires au sujet de la preuve statistique soumise \u00e0 l'audience. L'intim\u00e9 soumet que selon l'affaire Cramm (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9), une simple sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique d'un groupe affect\u00e9 par une r\u00e8gle neutre, n'\u00e9tablit pas en l'absence d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments que la r\u00e8gle a un effet n\u00e9gatif disproportionn\u00e9 sur le groupe num\u00e9rique le plus nombreux. Je crois utile de pr\u00e9ciser que ce commentaire s'inspire d'un arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame portant sur l'article 15 de la Charte canadienne (Voir: Thibodeau c. Canada, [1995] 2 R.C.S. 627 et Thibodeau c. M.N.R., [1994] C.F. 189 (C.A.). Je suis d'avis qu'on ne peut appliquer syst\u00e9matiquement ce commentaire sans prendre en consid\u00e9ration les enjeux propres \u00e0 chaque affaire; particuli\u00e8rement dans un contexte o\u00f9 le litige ne d\u00e9coule pas de la Charte mais d'une loi sur les droits de la personne. Dans l'arr\u00eat Brooks (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 29), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a rappel\u00e9, dans une affaire de discrimination en raison de la grossesse, que la suppression des fardeaux injustes impos\u00e9e aux femmes et aux autres groupes d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, constitue un objet fondamental des lois sur les droits de la personne.\n[161] Dans un contexte o\u00f9 il est reconnu par l'expert de l'intim\u00e9, l'existence de normes culturelles contraignantes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des femmes, on ne peut faire fi de ces normes ni des principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l'arr\u00eat Brooks lorsque je constate qu'une majorit\u00e9 substantielle de femmes employ\u00e9es \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e sont les grandes utilisatrices des cong\u00e9s parentaux de plus de soixante jours cons\u00e9cutifs.\n(iii) L'exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e [162] La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9labor\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode en trois \u00e9tapes pour d\u00e9terminer si une EPJ a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie (Voir : Colombie-Britannique (Superintendant of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin)). Ainsi, l'intim\u00e9 peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e, s'il \u00e9tablit:\nqu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail ou des fonctions; qu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime; que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, l'intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il est impossible de composer avec la plaignante ou avec les personnes qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques qu'elle sans subir une contrainte excessive. Il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer qu'il a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d'accommodement.\n(i) L'intim\u00e9 a-t-il adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail ou des fonctions en cause? [163] L'objectif de la nouvelle politique consiste \u00e0 maintenir l'\u00e9quilibre entre le traitement \u00e9quitable des employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une flexibilit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle. L'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de politique pr\u00e9cise que le recours \u00e0 l'emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un besoin continu. Ainsi, la justification de r\u00e9duire la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative de cinq ans \u00e0 trois ans est largement motiv\u00e9e par la preuve, particuli\u00e8rement le t\u00e9moignage de madame Murphy et le rapport produit par le comit\u00e9 mixte au mois d'ao\u00fbt 2002. Ce rapport \u00e9nonce plusieurs constats sur la situation des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e dont principalement la tr\u00e8s grande ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 ressentie par la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 l'exclusion des cong\u00e9s sans traitement de plus de soixante (60) jours cons\u00e9cutifs de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e dans un contexte plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral tel celui de l'objectif de la nouvelle politique, je conclus que cette norme est rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail et des fonctions en cause.\n[164] Par cons\u00e9quent, le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la d\u00e9fense est \u00e9tabli.\n(ii) L'intim\u00e9 a-t-il adopt\u00e9 sa norme de bonne foi? [165] Sur ce point, je suis d'avis que l'intim\u00e9 a adopt\u00e9 sa norme de bonne foi. Par cons\u00e9quent, le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la d\u00e9fense est \u00e9tabli.\n(iii) La norme est-elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but de l'intim\u00e9 de sorte qu'il ne peut composer avec la plaignante et les autres femmes qui prennent des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et \/ou parental sans subir une contrainte excessive? [166] D'entr\u00e9e de jeu, il faut souligner que la nouvelle politique s'applique aux employ\u00e9s comme Mme Lavoie, \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi sur la fonction publique ou de tout d\u00e9cret d'exclusion pris en vertu de cette derni\u00e8re. Bien que la nouvelle politique ait fait l'objet d'une consultation aupr\u00e8s de certains syndicats, cette consultation ne peut servir de justification aux effets discriminatoires identifi\u00e9s.\n[167] L'intim\u00e9 soutient que l'exclusion des cong\u00e9s sans traitement de plus de soixante jours cons\u00e9cutifs de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e dans un contexte o\u00f9 en vertu de la nouvelle politique, on r\u00e9duisait la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans \u00e0 trois ans. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, madame Murphy explique que l'une des pr\u00e9occupations consistait \u00e0 \u00e9viter des r\u00e9ajustements de la main-d'uvre au sein d'un minist\u00e8re. Le risque de se retrouver avec un surplus d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e dans une unit\u00e9 donn\u00e9e pourrait conduire \u00e9ventuellement \u00e0 des licenciements d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Cela implique des co\u00fbts. Or, madame Murphy pr\u00e9cise qu'il fallait s'assurer que cette nouvelle politique n'impliquerait pas des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 l'\u00c9tat.\n[168] Madame Murphy a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la nouvelle politique vise \u00e0 trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre un traitement \u00e9quitable pour les employ\u00e9s engag\u00e9s pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et le maintien d'une certaine flexibilit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle requise en faveur des gestionnaires. Madame Murphy explique que pour certains gestionnaires, la dur\u00e9e de service de deux ann\u00e9es \u00e9tait trop courte pour \u00e9valuer l'existence d'un besoin continu. Selon les gestionnaires consult\u00e9s, une p\u00e9riode de deux ann\u00e9es aurait incit\u00e9 certains d'entre eux \u00e0 retenir les services d'employ\u00e9s temporaires.\n[169] Sur l'exigence de fournir une prestation de travail, madame Murphy pr\u00e9cise que cette exigence \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire afin de pouvoir \u00e9valuer les besoins permanents d'une fonction.\n[170] Madame Murphy explique que toutes ces consid\u00e9rations ont fait en sorte d'adopter la nouvelle politique, tel qu'elle existe actuellement.\n[171] \u00c0 mon avis, ces consid\u00e9rations ne d\u00e9montrent pas qu'il est impossible \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de composer avec Mme Lavoie et les autres femmes qui prennent un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et \/ou un cong\u00e9 parental sans subir une contrainte excessive.\n[172] Au sujet de l'exigence de fournir une prestation de travail, je dois admettre que l'intim\u00e9 ne m'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l'existence d'un lien entre cette exigence et l'exclusion des cong\u00e9s non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s de plus de soixante (60) jours cons\u00e9cutifs. Dans un premier temps, je constate que les cong\u00e9s r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s sont comptabilis\u00e9s pour les fins du calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail. Ainsi, le fait que la personne soit absente du travail ne semble pas, du moins en partie, \u00eatre toujours requis.\n[173] De plus, l'ancienne politique ne comptabilisait pas les cong\u00e9s sans traitement alors que l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de cette politique pr\u00e9cisait aussi que le recours \u00e0 l'emploi pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e devait se limiter qu'\u00e0 des situations o\u00f9 le besoin existe clairement pour une p\u00e9riode limit\u00e9e et qu'il n'est pas pr\u00e9vu que ce besoin se perp\u00e9tuera. La nouvelle politique reprend essentiellement le m\u00eame \u00e9nonc\u00e9, en mentionnant que le recours \u00e0 l'emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un besoin continu. De ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je dois conclure que c'est le poste dont on \u00e9value les besoins et la prestation de travail de la personne qui occupe le poste ne d\u00e9termine pas ce besoin. Les personnes peuvent, par exemple \u00eatre remplac\u00e9es. C'est ce qui s'est produit, lorsque le conjoint de Mme Lavoie a remplac\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 l'occasion d'un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Le besoin du poste \u00e9tait donc reli\u00e9 aux t\u00e2ches \u00e0 effectuer.\n[174] La preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que l'intim\u00e9 a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse visant \u00e0 examiner la possibilit\u00e9 d'inclure la p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et celui parental. L'intim\u00e9 n'a fourni aucune preuve \u00e0 ce sujet ni en quoi, l'inclusion de ces cong\u00e9s pouvait constituer une contrainte excessive pour l'intim\u00e9. Entre autres, je ne dispose d'aucune preuve quant au co\u00fbt additionnel que pourrait comporter l'inclusion de ces cong\u00e9s dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de trois ann\u00e9es. La preuve soumise ne me permet pas d'\u00e9valuer l'existence de contraintes excessives. Bref, l'intim\u00e9 ne m'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il est impossible d'inclure dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail la dur\u00e9e des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et parentaux.\n[175] Cette m\u00eame conclusion s'applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 la situation de Mme Lavoie car la preuve de l'intim\u00e9 ne d\u00e9montre pas l'existence d'une contrainte excessive justifiant le refus de l'intim\u00e9 d'inclure la dur\u00e9e du cong\u00e9 parental de la plaignante dans le calcul des trois ann\u00e9es. Enfin, la preuve de l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tablit pas qu'il \u00e9tait impossible d'inclure la dur\u00e9e du cong\u00e9 parental de la plaignante.\n[176] Pourtant, la convention collective applicable aux parties pr\u00e9voit dans certaines situations que les cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et parentaux sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des p\u00e9riodes de service. Ainsi, l'intim\u00e9 semble reconna\u00eetre le bien-fond\u00e9 du principe d'accommodement et la pertinence d'inclure ces cong\u00e9s dans la p\u00e9riode de service.\n[177] La preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune consid\u00e9ration ni \u00e9tude pr\u00e9cise de la part de l'intim\u00e9 sur la possibilit\u00e9 d'accommoder les femmes qui prennent des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 ou parental. Dans un contexte o\u00f9 l'emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de l'intim\u00e9 constitue une activit\u00e9 professionnelle plus vuln\u00e9rable et qu'il est clairement reconnu que les femmes sont tr\u00e8s largement majoritaires dans ce type d'emploi pr\u00e9caire, la possibilit\u00e9 d'accommoder les femmes prenant des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 ou parental devenait une question incontournable.\n[178] L'intim\u00e9, pour utiliser l'expression de la juge McLachlin dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin a choisi une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par 62). Une formule qui ne peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9e qu'en bloc \u00e0 savoir : trois ann\u00e9es excluant les cong\u00e9s non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s dont le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et celui parental. Or, cette formule en bloc d\u00e9montre une absence de flexibilit\u00e9.\n[179] Comme le soulignait madame Julie C. Lloyd, membre instructeur, dans l'affaire Hoyt c. Compagnie des chemins de fer du Canada 2006 TCDP au par. 33 : Les employeurs doivent \u00eatre innovateurs dans leur recherche de l'accommodement \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 un employ\u00e9. Ils doivent faire preuve de flexibilit\u00e9 et de cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9.\n[180] Or, l'intim\u00e9 ne m'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 avoir recherch\u00e9 la flexibilit\u00e9 et la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 qui s'imposaient en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[181] Je conclus que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas examin\u00e9 toutes les possibilit\u00e9s qui lui permettraient d'accommoder Mme Lavoie et les femmes \u00e0 contrat \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui prennent un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ou parental.\n[182] L'intim\u00e9 est un employeur important disposant des ressources humaines et techniques lui permettant de r\u00e9aliser une analyse appropri\u00e9e des mesures possibles qui ne lui imposent pas une contrainte excessive.\n[183] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve me permettant de conclure qu'il existe ou existait une contrainte excessive en incluant dans la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail, la dur\u00e9e du cong\u00e9 parental de Mme Lavoie, soit quatre mois, ni les p\u00e9riodes de cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 ou parental qu'ont pris ou que prennent les femmes \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9 pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e depuis l'adoption de la nouvelle politique.\n[184] Pour tous ces motifs, j'estime que la plainte est fond\u00e9e et doit \u00eatre accueillie.\nVII. LES REDRESSEMENTS DEMAND\u00c9S PAR MME LAVOIE ET LA COMMISSION: A. Modification de la politique pour \u00e9liminer les aspects discriminatoires [185] Mme Lavoie et la Commission me demandent d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de modifier la nouvelle politique de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9liminer les aspects discriminatoires. \u00c0 mon avis, une telle demande est appropri\u00e9e. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9 maintient une norme selon laquelle la dur\u00e9e des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 ou parental de plus de soixante (60) jours civils cumulatifs n'est pas prise en compte dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative pour une nomination \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, je suis d'avis qu'il y a lieu d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de modifier la politique, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9liminer les aspects discriminatoires en raison du sexe.\n[186] En cons\u00e9quence, j'ordonne, suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi, que l'intim\u00e9 mette fin aux actes discriminatoires et qu'il prenne, en consultation avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables, et en particulier ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de modifier la nouvelle Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 1er avril 2003, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9liminer les aspects discriminatoires en raison du sexe, soit ceux reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l'exclusion de la dur\u00e9e des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et\/ou parental dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative pour une nomination \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nB. Perte de chances ou d'avantages et perte de salaire [187] Aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b), le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 d'accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte l'a priv\u00e9e.\n[188] Aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte.\n[189] L'intim\u00e9 a reconnu que si la plainte \u00e9tait accueillie, les redressements demand\u00e9s par Mme Lavoie \u00e9taient admis, y compris le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9. Ces redressements sont les suivants:\nP\u00e9riode du d\u00e9lai de carence de deux semaines pour l'assurance emploi (19 ao\u00fbt au 1er septembre 2002): 2008.00$ Indemnit\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires (PRSC) pour la p\u00e9riode du 2 septembre 2002 au 5 ao\u00fbt 2003: 28 959.00$ Indemnit\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires (PRSC) pour la p\u00e9riode du 6 ao\u00fbt 2003 au 20 ao\u00fbt 2003: 1864.26$\n[190] Cependant, l'intim\u00e9 conteste la perte de salaire r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par la plaignante pour la p\u00e9riode du 19 septembre 2003 au 18 novembre 2003. Le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 pour cette p\u00e9riode est admis soit 5790.99$. Toutefois, l'intim\u00e9 soutient qu'en signant l'entente intervenue avec Industrie Canada, Mme Lavoie a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer toute perte de salaire pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent sa date d'entr\u00e9e en fonction \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, soit le 19 novembre 2003. Pour les m\u00eames raisons \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le cadre du moyen d'irrecevabilit\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9, je conclus que Mme Lavoie n'a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer la perte de salaire dont l'a priv\u00e9e la non-conversion de son poste.\n[191] J'ajouterai qu'en reconnaissant le droit \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9riode du 6 ao\u00fbt 2003 au 20 ao\u00fbt 2003, l'intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que Mme Lavoie n'a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer toute perte de revenu \u00e0 compter du 6 ao\u00fbt 2003, date \u00e0 laquelle elle aurait obtenu le droit \u00e0 la conversion de son poste.\n[192] Par cons\u00e9quent, je fais droit \u00e0 tous les redressements demand\u00e9s par Mme Lavoie en vertu des alin\u00e9as 53(2)b) et 53(2)c), y compris le montant de 5709.99$ correspondant \u00e0 la perte de salaire pour la p\u00e9riode du 19 septembre 2003 au 18 novembre 2003.\n[193] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 la plaignante, Mme Lavoie, la somme de 38 622.25 $ \u00e0 titre de perte d'avantages et de salaire aux termes des articles 53(2)b) et 53(2)c) de la Loi.\nC. L'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral [194] En vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), le Tribunal peut accorder une indemnit\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000$ pour la victime qui a souffert d'un pr\u00e9judice moral.\n[195] \u00c0 mon avis, bien que la preuve ne soit pas \u00e9toff\u00e9e quant aux r\u00e9percussions morales que les actes de l'intim\u00e9 ont eu sur la plaignante, il est \u00e9vident par son t\u00e9moignage que ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont ind\u00e9niablement affect\u00e9 Mme Lavoie et ont port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9. Le droit \u00e0 l'emploi est fondamental dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et constitue une composante importante de la dignit\u00e9 humaine. De plus, je retiens notamment, le stress reli\u00e9 aux responsabilit\u00e9s financi\u00e8res et au fait qu'elle savait que tout \u00e9tait fini \u00e0 compter du 6 ao\u00fbt 2003. Bref, les moments d'ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 v\u00e9cus par Mme Lavoie me semblent \u00e9vidents dans une p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle devait assumer ses responsabilit\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s de trois enfants.\n[196] Compte tenu de l'ensemble de ces circonstances, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 la plaignante, Mme Lavoie, la somme de 5 000.00$ au titre de l'indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi.\nD. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [197] Des int\u00e9r\u00eats sont payables \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toutes les r\u00e9clamations mon\u00e9taires accord\u00e9es en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision suivant le paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi. J'ordonne que les int\u00e9r\u00eats soient pay\u00e9s sur les sommes accord\u00e9es en vertu de cette d\u00e9cision, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9 (12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les sommes accord\u00e9es pour compenser les pertes d'avantages devront courir \u00e0 partir du 6 ao\u00fbt 2003, calcul\u00e9s en fonction du moment o\u00f9 les indemnit\u00e9s auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 payables. Pour la perte de salaire correspondant \u00e0 un montant de 5 790.99$, les int\u00e9r\u00eats devront courir \u00e0 compter du 19 septembre 2003, \u00e9galement calcul\u00e9 en fonction du moment o\u00f9 le salaire aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 payable \u00e0 Mme Lavoie. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l'indemnit\u00e9 devant \u00eatre vers\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9judice moral devront courir \u00e0 compter de la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, soit le 19 janvier 2004.\nVIII. LA D\u00c9CLARATION DE COMP\u00c9TENCE PAR LE TRIBUNAL [198] Le Tribunal conservera sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, \u00e0 entendre des arguments suppl\u00e9mentaires et \u00e0 rendre des ordonnances suppl\u00e9mentaires dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 les parties ne s'entendent pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'interpr\u00e9tation ou de la mise en application des redressements ordonn\u00e9s.\n[199] Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence en vertu du paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent pour une dur\u00e9e de soixante (60) jours \u00e0 compter de la date de r\u00e9ception de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision par les parties.\nsign\u00e9e par\nKathleen Cahill\nOTTAWA (Ontario) le 20 juin 2008\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1154\/3606\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nBrigitte Lavoie c.

Subsidiairement, les intim\u00e9es demandent que l'affaire soit rouverte et que les t\u00e9moins soient rappel\u00e9s pour un interrogatoire au sujet du fait que le plaignant, M. Richard Warman, et la Commission ont affich\u00e9 des messages sur les sites Web qui font l'objet de plaintes.\n[2] Les intim\u00e9es soutiennent qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission n'a pas divulgu\u00e9 des renseignements portant sur le fait que ses enqu\u00eateurs s'\u00e9taient cr\u00e9\u00e9s des comptes dans les forums de discussion qu'ils consid\u00e9raient controvers\u00e9s. Elles ajoutent que le fait de ne pas divulguer ces renseignements constitue un manquement aux principes de justice naturelle et d'\u00e9quit\u00e9, en plus d'\u00eatre un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[3] Les intim\u00e9es fondent leurs arguments sur une d\u00e9claration que Mme Margot Blight, l\u2019avocate principale de la Commission, a faite dans l'affaire Warman c. Lemire. Elles soutiennent que Mme Blight a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la politique explicite de la Commission \u00e9tait de ne pas communiquer de tels renseignements dans les demandes d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'information et dans le cadre de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales de divulgation.\n[4] De plus, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'affaire Warman c. Lemire, les intim\u00e9es font valoir que l'enqu\u00eateur principal de la Commission, Dean Steacy, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Commission n'avait pas de liste ni de registre central des comptes utilisateurs que la Commission et les services de police cr\u00e9aient dans les forums. En outre, les intim\u00e9es soutiennent que M. Steacy a reconnu, pendant son t\u00e9moignage, qu'une personne pouvait \u00eatre tenue responsable du contenu que les policiers ou les enqu\u00eateurs avaient affich\u00e9 sur les forums, puisqu'il n'existait pas de registre central. Les intim\u00e9es expliquent que M. Steacy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que dans certains cas, seuls un autre employ\u00e9 de la Commission et lui-m\u00eame \u00e9taient au courant de la pratique consistant \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un compte d\u2019infiltration sur les forums qui font l'objet d'une enqu\u00eate.\n[5] Les intim\u00e9es soutiennent enfin que, compte tenu du fait que l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce [Traduction] peut donner lieu \u00e0 l\u2019imposition d\u2019une lourde amende \u00e0 une personne monoparentale qui a un faible revenu, ainsi qu'une interdiction, possiblement \u00e0 vie, d'afficher des messages qui contreviennent \u00e0 une loi ridiculement vague, la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[6] Le plaignant est d'avis que la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate n'est fond\u00e9e sur aucune preuve et que le Tribunal ne peut pas rendre une ordonnance sans rouvrir l'affaire pour examiner les preuves.\n[7] Quant \u00e0 elle, la Commission est d'avis que rien dans les all\u00e9gations des intim\u00e9es ne justifie, de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, le rejet de la plainte ou la r\u00e9ouverture de l'affaire. Elle soutient qu'il serait plus appropri\u00e9 d'examiner les all\u00e9gations des intim\u00e9es dans le cadre d'une contestation constitutionnelle, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9es, que le Tribunal pourrait examiner une fois qu'il aura rendu une d\u00e9cision sur le fond en l'esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 ce sujet, la Commission fait valoir que la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9es est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e, qu'elle est sans fondement et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au mauvais tribunal.\n[8] Le Tribunal n'a pas encore rendu de d\u00e9cision sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de l'affaire. Il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9 que, lorsqu'une d\u00e9cision serait rendue sur le fond, s'il est conclu que les intim\u00e9es ont viol\u00e9 l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, il surseoirait \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de la d\u00e9cision et examinerait la contestation constitutionnelle des intim\u00e9es.\n[9] Le Tribunal est d'avis que, compte tenu de la nature des questions soulev\u00e9es par les intim\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, c'est-\u00e0-dire les mesures prises par la Commission qui violeraient les principes de la justice naturelle et de l'application r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de la loi, ainsi que le droit \u00e0 une audience \u00e9quitable, garantis par l'article 7 et l'alin\u00e9a 11d) de la Charte canadienne, il serait mieux de traiter ces questions dans le cadre d'une contestation constitutionnelle d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9es. L'avis de question constitutionnelle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9es mentionne d\u00e9j\u00e0 l'article 1, les alin\u00e9as 2a), b) et d), ainsi que l'article 7 de la Loi comme fondement de leur contestation constitutionnelle.\n[10] La proposition selon laquelle le Tribunal devrait rejeter la pr\u00e9sente plainte en raison de t\u00e9moignages entendus dans une autre affaire n'a pas de fondement juridique. De plus, rouvrir l'affaire pour entendre des t\u00e9moignages suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape ne ferait que prolonger une proc\u00e9dure qui dure d\u00e9j\u00e0 depuis trop longtemps.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate des intim\u00e9es en rejet de la plainte et, subsidiairement, en r\u00e9ouverture de l'affaire est rejet\u00e9e. Les intim\u00e9es pourront soulever \u00e0 nouveau les questions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce dans le cadre de la contestation constitutionnelle, que le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'entendre lorsque la d\u00e9cision sur le fond sera rendue.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 24 juin 2008\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1089\/7005 et T1090\/7105\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Richard Warman c.

Hadjis\n[1] La partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e la Canadian Association for Free Expression (la CAFE), a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate [traduction] exigeant ma r\u00e9cusation de la pr\u00e9sente affaire sur le fondement d'une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Dans sa requ\u00eate, la CAFE d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\n[traduction] R\u00e9cemment, \u00e0 la suite de recherches Internet, la CAFE s'est rendu compte que le membre Hadjis a, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, travaill\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Congr\u00e8s juif canadien, qui a obtenu le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance, malgr\u00e9 les solides objections de l'intim\u00e9.\n[2] Dans ses observations concernant la requ\u00eate de la CAFE, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il [traduction] appuyait l'argument de la CAFE selon lequel il y a une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9, mais qu'il ne voyait pas l'avantage de faire entendre ni la requ\u00eate ni l'affaire par un autre membre. Je crois comprendre, par cons\u00e9quent, que l'intim\u00e9 ne sollicite pas d'ordonnance visant ma r\u00e9cusation. La partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e la Canadian Free Speech League (la CFSL) a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle [traduction] appuie l'argument de la CAFE qu'il y a une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Aucune autre partie n'a appuy\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de la CAFE.\n[3] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la CAFE a demand\u00e9 qu'un autre membre du Tribunal entende la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Cependant, comme l'a soulign\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Nation et Bande des Indiens Samson c.

Canada, 1998 CanLII 7815 (C.A.F.), le juge contre lequel une demande de r\u00e9cusation est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e doit entendre la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation. Aucune jurisprudence n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui de l'assertion qu'un membre du Tribunal autre que celui vis\u00e9 par l'all\u00e9gation visant sa r\u00e9cusation devrait entendre la demande. Sara Blake d\u00e9clare ce qui suit dans Administrative Law in Canada, 4e \u00e9dition (Markham, LexisNexis Canada, 2006), aux pages 114 et 115 :\n[traduction] Lorsqu'une all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 est formul\u00e9e, le tribunal devrait statuer sur celle-ci. S'il juge qu'il n'est aucunement partial, il peut poursuivre l'audience. Il n'est pas tenu de suspendre la proc\u00e9dure. Un tribunal ne doit pas se retrouver paralys\u00e9 chaque fois qu'une personne formule une all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9.\nDans Flamborough (Ville) c. Canada (Office national de l'\u00e9nergie), [1984] A.C.F. no 526 (C.A.F.), le juge Mahoney a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nJ'aurais d\u00fb ajouter que la proposition selon laquelle un membre d'un tribunal faisant l'objet d'une all\u00e9gation de crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9, ne peut pas personnellement trancher cette question ni m\u00eame prendre part au processus d\u00e9cisionnel qui la concerne, est tout \u00e0 fait insens\u00e9e. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas selon la loi, quiconque voudrait all\u00e9guer la partialit\u00e9 pourrait, en pratique, paralyser les tribunaux et les cours de justice, au gr\u00e9 de sa fantaisie. Le contr\u00f4le judiciaire et le pourvoi en appel garantissent l'examen de telles all\u00e9gations, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, par des juges impartiaux.\nJe remarque que dans Arsenault-Cameron c. \u00cele-du-Prince-\u00c9douard, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 851, le juge Bastarache a examin\u00e9 personnellement la requ\u00eate visant sa r\u00e9cusation de l'affaire. Par le pass\u00e9, lorsque des all\u00e9gations de partialit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, les membres du Tribunal ont habituellement entendu les requ\u00eates en r\u00e9cusation d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre eux et statu\u00e9 sur celles-ci; voir, par exemple, Caza c. T\u00e9l\u00e9-M\u00e9tropole inc., (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/336; Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TCDP 46.\n[4] Par cons\u00e9quent, je rendrai une d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation de la CAFE.\nLe crit\u00e8re de la crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9\n[5] Le crit\u00e8re de la crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9, repris par la Cour supr\u00eame dans Bande indienne Wewaykum c. Canada, 2003 CSC 45, au paragraphe 74, et tir\u00e9 de son arr\u00eat ant\u00e9rieur Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. c. L'Office national de l'\u00e9nergie et al., [1978] 1 R.C.S. 369, est exprim\u00e9 ainsi :\n\u00c0 quelle conclusion arriverait une personne bien renseign\u00e9e qui \u00e9tudierait la question en profondeur, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique?\nLa Cour supr\u00eame, dans Wewaykum, a soulign\u00e9 que la norme fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une crainte de partialit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur des motifs s\u00e9rieux, tout en citant un extrait tir\u00e9 de l'arr\u00eat Committee for Justice and Liberty (p. 395), qui est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\nToutefois, les motifs de crainte doivent \u00eatre s\u00e9rieux et je suis compl\u00e8tement d'accord avec la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui refuse d'admettre que le crit\u00e8re doit \u00eatre celui d'une personne de nature scrupuleuse ou tatillonne.\n[6] Il importe de noter que la Cour supr\u00eame, dans Wewaykum, une affaire portant sur la partialit\u00e9 judiciaire, a appliqu\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Committee for Justice and Liberty, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 dans le contexte des tribunaux administratifs.\n[7] J'ai examin\u00e9 les points soulev\u00e9s par la CAFE dans sa requ\u00eate et je juge que le crit\u00e8re de la crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rempli, pour les motifs qui suivent.\nLes faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s [8] Bien qu'il soit mentionn\u00e9 dans la requ\u00eate de la CAFE que j'ai travaill\u00e9 [traduction] \u00e0 plusieurs reprises aupr\u00e8s du Congr\u00e8s juif canadien (le CJC), une seule circonstance y est cit\u00e9e :\n[traduction] Le 24 novembre 1997, Athanasios Hadjis a publi\u00e9 un communiqu\u00e9 de presse conjointement avec le Congr\u00e8s juif canadien dans lequel il d\u00e9non\u00e7ait Jacques Parizeau et d\u00e9clarait que M. Parizeau [traduction] bl\u00e2me certaines collectivit\u00e9s pour les r\u00e9sultats d'un processus d\u00e9mocratique. M. Hadjis a poursuivi en disant que [traduction] ce genre d'attitude est irresponsable parce qu'elle aggrave les tensions au sein de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Le Congr\u00e8s juif canadien affirme dans son communiqu\u00e9 de presse qu'il forme une [traduction] coalition avec le Congr\u00e8s hell\u00e9nique du Qu\u00e9bec de M. Hadjis.\n[9] La CAFE n'a fourni au Tribunal aucune copie du communiqu\u00e9 de presse en question et je ne m'en souviens pas particuli\u00e8rement. Je peux cependant affirmer qu'il ne pouvait pas s'agir d'un communiqu\u00e9 que j'aurais publi\u00e9 conjointement avec le CJC, et que le Congr\u00e8s hell\u00e9nique du Qu\u00e9bec (le CHQ) n'\u00e9tait manifestement pas le [traduction] congr\u00e8s de M. Hadjis. \u00c9videmment, des pr\u00e9cisions s'imposent. Le CHQ \u00e9tait une organisation-cadre pour diverses associations actives au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 grecque (hell\u00e9nique) du Qu\u00e9bec. Le mandat du CHQ, pour autant que je me rappelle, consistait \u00e0 exprimer les opinions des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois d'origine hell\u00e9nique sur des questions d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. J'ai si\u00e9g\u00e9 au conseil d'administration du CHQ \u00e0 compter d'environ 1993 jusqu'\u00e0 1999.\n[10] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 1990, comme tous les Canadiens le savent, les Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ont engag\u00e9 un d\u00e9bat public au sujet de l'avenir de la province au sein du Canada. Une partie de cette discussion concernait les opinions des minorit\u00e9s au Qu\u00e9bec sur la question et le r\u00f4le qu'elles jouaient; le CHQ a exprim\u00e9 sans h\u00e9sitation les opinions et pr\u00e9occupations de la collectivit\u00e9 hell\u00e9nique \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Par la suite, il est devenu \u00e9vident que d'autres collectivit\u00e9s culturelles (groupes ethniques) au Qu\u00e9bec avaient des opinions semblables. Par cons\u00e9quent, le CHQ a publi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occasion des d\u00e9clarations communes et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des notes d'information conjointement avec des organisations qui repr\u00e9sentaient ces autres collectivit\u00e9s, en particulier la collectivit\u00e9 italienne (Congr\u00e8s national des Italo-Canadiens) et la collectivit\u00e9 juive (Congr\u00e8s juif canadien, r\u00e9gion du Qu\u00e9bec). Il se peut que le communiqu\u00e9 de presse [traduction] publi\u00e9 conjointement mentionn\u00e9 dans la requ\u00eate de la CAFE ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'une de ces d\u00e9clarations communes. Les membres du conseil d'administration du CHQ assumaient par roulement le r\u00f4le de porte-parole du groupe. Outre ces d\u00e9clarations aux m\u00e9dias, les trois groupes ont organis\u00e9 des r\u00e9unions entre les membres de leurs collectivit\u00e9s et d'autres Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois en vue de favoriser le dialogue.\n[11] Alors que j'en \u00e9tais membre, ces organisations n'ont jamais discut\u00e9 des questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, soit la propagande haineuse, la libert\u00e9 d'expression, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. De plus, je ne connais pas les personnes qui ont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le CJC dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire et je n'ai pas eu affaire \u00e0 elles. Enfin, je d\u00e9sire souligner que je n'ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 membre du CJC et que je n'ai jamais agi comme avocat pour les membres de ce congr\u00e8s.\nAnalyse [12] Tout d'abord, comme l'a mentionn\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Wewaykum, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 85, l'\u00e9coulement du temps est un facteur important qui doit \u00e9clairer la personne raisonnable dans son appr\u00e9ciation de l'incidence de la participation d'un membre ou d'un juge. La Cour a soulign\u00e9 que, dans la plupart des cas o\u00f9 l'on plaide l'inhabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cideur, on invoque des circonstances contemporaines au processus d\u00e9cisionnel ou survenues peu avant celui-ci. Ma participation au CHQ remonte \u00e0 plus de neuf ans, et il y a encore plus longtemps que j'ai fait affaire avec le CJC de la r\u00e9gion du Qu\u00e9bec pour la derni\u00e8re fois. Il s'agit d'une longue p\u00e9riode de temps.\n[13] Dans Z\u00fcndel c. Citron, [2000] 2 C.F. 225, aux paragraphes 43 \u00e0 45, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a attir\u00e9 l'attention sur le fait que le membre du Tribunal en question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 du dossier neuf ans apr\u00e8s la publication d'un communiqu\u00e9 de presse sur lequel \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e la demande de r\u00e9cusation. La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que cet \u00e9coulement de temps, de m\u00eame que certains autres facteurs, \u00e9taient suffisants pour \u00e9liminer toute apparence de partialit\u00e9. Dans Weywaykum, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le fait donnant lieu \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation du juge Binnie remontait \u00e0 15 ans avant l'audience \u00e0 laquelle il si\u00e9geait. La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu qu'une personne raisonnable, consid\u00e9rant la question de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste, ne conclurait pas que le r\u00f4le ant\u00e9rieur jou\u00e9 par le juge Binnie pourrait influencer, m\u00eame inconsciemment, sa capacit\u00e9 de demeurer impartial (au paragraphe 90 de l'arr\u00eat).\n[14] La nature de la participation du d\u00e9cideur constitue aussi un facteur important. Dans l'arr\u00eat Arsenault-Cameron, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 4, le juge Bastarache a cit\u00e9 avec approbation la conclusion tir\u00e9e par une cour de l'Afrique du Sud selon laquelle aucune demande de r\u00e9cusation ne pouvait \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur le lien qui unit l'avocat \u00e0 son client, \u00e0 moins que l'avocat n'ait conseill\u00e9 une partie au litige devant \u00eatre tranch\u00e9. Cependant, m\u00eame lorsqu'il y a participation \u00e0 la m\u00eame affaire, l'\u00e9coulement du temps peut servir \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer la crainte de partialit\u00e9. Dans Wewaykum, la question en litige avait trait au r\u00f4le du juge Binnie, en tant que sous-ministre adjoint du minist\u00e8re de la Justice, dans l'affaire m\u00eame qui \u00e9tait port\u00e9e en appel et sur laquelle il devait alors se prononcer comme juge de la cour, et \u00e0 laquelle le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e9tait partie. N\u00e9anmoins, la cour a conclu qu'une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie et que le juge Binnie n'\u00e9tait pas inhabile \u00e0 entendre l'appel.\n[15] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, mon r\u00f4le aupr\u00e8s du CHQ et, ce qui est encore plus important, les rapports du CHQ avec le CJC de la r\u00e9gion du Qu\u00e9bec, n'\u00e9taient aucunement li\u00e9s aux questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Je conclus que ce facteur ainsi que l'\u00e9coulement d'une longue p\u00e9riode de temps inciteraient, pour ces seuls motifs, une personne bien renseign\u00e9e, examinant la question de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique, \u00e0 conclure qu'il n'existe aucune crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[16] Cependant, la CAFE a cit\u00e9 de nombreux faits survenus durant l'audience pour soutenir qu'il existe effectivement une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Avant de les aborder, je crois qu'il est important de noter les commentaires de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans Middelkamp c. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board, 1993 CanLII 2884, aux paragraphes 11 et 13, cit\u00e9s avec approbation dans le jugement Nation et Bande des Indiens Samson, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 (C.F. 1re inst.) :\n[traduction] Comme le juge en chef de notre Cour l'a dit je crois \u00e0 plus d'une reprise, un proc\u00e8s n'est pas une r\u00e9ception mondaine. Mais quand on parle de partialit\u00e9, on ne parle pas d'un juge qui ne ferait pas preuve d'une politesse ou d'une pr\u00e9venance absolue. La partialit\u00e9 s'entend d'un parti pris en faveur d'une partie ou d'une autre. Il ne s'agit pas d'une opinion sur le litige qui s'appuierait sur la preuve, ni d'un penchant, d'une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence, ou m\u00eame d'un sentiment avou\u00e9 de respect particulier envers un avocat ou un autre, ni d'un manque de respect manifeste envers un autre avocat, si le juge estime que celui-ci manque de professionnalisme.\n[. . .]\nIl ne faut pas confondre la partialit\u00e9 et un proc\u00e8s qui pourrait s'av\u00e9rer insatisfaisant en bout de ligne.\nJe laisse \u00e0 d'autres le soin de juger si j'ai fait preuve d'une politesse et d'une pr\u00e9venance absolue envers toutes les parties en l'esp\u00e8ce, mais m\u00eame le fait de ne pas respecter ces normes ne constitue pas n\u00e9cessairement une preuve de partialit\u00e9.\n[17] La CAFE donne \u00e0 entendre dans sa requ\u00eate que la d\u00e9cision que j'ai rendue pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la pr\u00e9sente audience de permettre au CJC de participer en tant que partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e malgr\u00e9 les [traduction] solides objections de l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9montre une partialit\u00e9. Ma d\u00e9cision d'autoriser le CJC \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ainsi que toutes les autres parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es (Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 8), a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise pour des raisons qui allaient de soi et qui, \u00e0 mon avis, n'inciteraient pas une personne bien renseign\u00e9e qui \u00e9tudierait la question de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique \u00e0 conclure qu'il existe une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. De plus, comme toute autre d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, ma d\u00e9cision est susceptible d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Je veux \u00e9galement faire remarquer en passant que le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la CAFE le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce malgr\u00e9 les tout aussi solides objections de la Commission.\n[18] La CAFE accorde aussi une grande importance \u00e0 ce qu'elle appelle [traduction] l'empressement du Tribunal de trancher la question bien qu'un certain nombre de documents aient \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] r\u00e9cemment divulgu\u00e9s. La CAFE affirme que cela d\u00e9montre qu'une partie [traduction] quelconque exerce une pression sur le Tribunal pour qu'il [traduction] mette fin \u00e0 l'audience. Les questions concernant l'\u00e9tablissement des dates d'audience de la pr\u00e9sente affaire et le traitement des documents produits depuis juin 2007 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es dans ma d\u00e9cision du 5 juin 2008, Warman c. Lemire, 2008 TCDP 20. Je crois qu'il ressort clairement du paragraphe 26 de cette d\u00e9cision, ainsi que des paragraphes suivants, quels facteurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en compte par le Tribunal pour l'\u00e9tablissement des dates d'audience dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. \u00c0 mon avis, ces paragraphes ne d\u00e9montrent pas une influence indue de la part d'une partie [traduction] quelconque en l'esp\u00e8ce ou un parti pris en faveur de celle-ci.\n[19] La CAFE d\u00e9clare \u00e9galement que j'ai d\u00e9montr\u00e9 de la partialit\u00e9 lorsque [traduction] la t\u00e2che enti\u00e8re d'expliquer pourquoi l'audience devait se poursuivre a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du 15 janvier 2008, en ce qui concerne la demande qu'elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en application de l'article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada. J'aimerais tout d'abord souligner que la Cour avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, sans fournir de d\u00e9tails, que l'information faisant l'objet de la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en application de l'article 37 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9e. Cela soulevait la possibilit\u00e9 que tout autre interrogatoire des personnes qui devaient t\u00e9moigner au sujet de cette information ne f\u00fbt plus n\u00e9cessaire. De plus, toutes les parties, et non seulement l'intim\u00e9, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter leurs observations sur la fa\u00e7on dont l'affaire devait se poursuivre. L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter en premier ses observations, en partie parce que son avocate avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, pendant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d'instance du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2008, qu'elle pr\u00e9voyait d\u00e9poser d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 ne s'est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e de proc\u00e9der ainsi durant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Quoi qu'il en soit, je ne vois pas comment ces circonstances peuvent d\u00e9montrer de la partialit\u00e9.\n[20] La CAFE fait une affirmation semblable quant \u00e0 ma d\u00e9cision de demander \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de me fournir une [traduction] montagne de documents. Il s'agissait en fait de copies num\u00e9riques de documents de la Commission comportant des suppressions auxquelles l'intim\u00e9 s'\u00e9tait oppos\u00e9, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es au Tribunal par courriel, en format PDF. Comme je l'ai expliqu\u00e9 dans ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, Warman c. Lemire, 2008 TCDP 16, au premier paragraphe, j'avais demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de me fournir ces copies pour que je puisse mieux comprendre l'objet du diff\u00e9rend qui avait donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un \u00e9change de nombreuses lettres entre les parties. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les documents, j'ai rendu la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate susmentionn\u00e9e dans laquelle j'ai ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de me fournir la version non expurg\u00e9e de ces documents pour que je puisse effectuer une comparaison et d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 des suppressions apport\u00e9es. Ici encore, je ne vois pas dans quelle mesure ces faits d\u00e9montrent une partialit\u00e9.\n[21] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je ne suis donc pas persuad\u00e9 que l'information et les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la CAFE inciteraient une personne bien renseign\u00e9e qui a examin\u00e9 la question en profondeur, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique, \u00e0 conclure qu'il existe une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Les motifs s\u00e9rieux qu'exige une telle crainte de partialit\u00e9 n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis.\n[22] Je soulignerais \u00e9galement l'affirmation faite par la CAFE dans sa requ\u00eate selon laquelle elle ne s'est rendue compte du [traduction] communiqu\u00e9 publi\u00e9 conjointement que [traduction] r\u00e9cemment \u00e0 la suite de recherches Internet. Rien n'indique que cette information n'\u00e9tait pas accessible au public sur Internet ou ailleurs depuis le d\u00e9but de la participation de la CAFE \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire (le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2006), ni m\u00eame depuis 1997, ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 le communiqu\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, il se peut que la CAFE ait implicitement renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 toute assertion d'une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9; voir Affaire int\u00e9ressant le Tribunal des droits de la personne et \u00c9nergie atomique du Canada Limit\u00e9e, [1986] 1 C.F 103 (C.A.F.).

INTRODUCTION [1] La plaignante, Jean Bignell-Malcolm, est une femme autochtone d'origine crie. Elle all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9e, la bande indienne Ebb and Flow, a refus\u00e9 de l'embaucher au poste de directrice de l'enseignement de l'\u00e9cole Ebb and Flow en raison de sa race et de son origine nationale ou ethnique, ce qui contrevient \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP).\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e, la bande indienne Ebb and Flow, est une bande autochtone constitu\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens du Canada. La collectivit\u00e9 Ebb and Flow est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 environ deux cents kilom\u00e8tres au nord de Winnipeg, au Manitoba, et est constitu\u00e9e de personnes de diff\u00e9rentes races, origines ethniques et origines nationales, quoique la majorit\u00e9 de la population soit ojibway.\n[3] L'audience a dur\u00e9 5 jours et a eu lieu en octobre 2007. La plaignante, l'intim\u00e9e et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des avocats.\nII. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [4] Les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte sont les suivantes :\nLa plaignante a-t-elle prouv\u00e9 prima facie que l'intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire en refusant de l'embaucher en raison de sa race ou de son origine nationale ou ethnique? Si la plaignante a \u00e9tabli prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire, l'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fourni une explication raisonnable justifiant l'acte apparemment discriminatoire? S'il est conclu que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, quelles r\u00e9parations convient-il d'accorder?\nIII. PREUVE ET ANALYSE [5] Lorsqu'un plaignant all\u00e8gue, comme l'a fait Mme Bignell-Malcolm, qu'on a refus\u00e9 de l'embaucher pour des motifs discriminatoires, au d\u00e9part, le fardeau de la preuve lui incombe. Le plaignant doit d'abord \u00e9tablir prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire. Si la preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie, il incombe alors \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de fournir une explication raisonnable.\na) La plaignante, Mme Bignell-Malcolm, a-t-elle prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire?\n[6] Il n'y a pas de crit\u00e8re rigide \u00e0 appliquer lorsqu'on examine si l'acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 prima facie dans une plainte o\u00f9 un refus d'embaucher est all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Le juge des faits doit se montrer souple et attentif aux faits propres \u00e0 chaque affaire. En derni\u00e8re analyse, la question sera de savoir si la partie plaignante a satisfait au crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpson-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 558 (O'Malley) : si on y ajoute foi, la preuve produite par le plaignant est-elle compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en sa faveur en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e?\n[7] Cela dit, dans les circonstances comme celles de l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant n'aura souvent qu'\u00e0 prouver les faits suivants. D'abord, il doit prouver qu'il a postul\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste pour lequel il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9, mais que sa candidature n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue. Ensuite, il doit montrer qu'une personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas une des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme un motif de distinction illicite selon la LCDP, a obtenu l'emploi ou que l'employeur a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher des candidats pour le poste (voir Shakes c. Rex Pak Ltd. (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001; Israeli c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Commission de la fonction publique (1983), 4 C.H.R.R.D., et Premakumar c. Air Canada, [2002] D.C.D.P. no 3, (au paragraphe 77).\n[8] La preuve pertinente produite par la plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce est la suivante.\nPreuve de la plaignante\n[9] Mme Bignell-Malcolm a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle r\u00e9sidait dans la collectivit\u00e9 Ebb and Flow depuis plus de 20 ans au moment o\u00f9 les faits en cause se sont produits. Elle a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans cette collectivit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9pous\u00e9 un membre de la bande indienne Ebb and Flow vers 1982 et elle est devenue membre de la bande en 1984.\n[10] Mme Bignell-Malcolm a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow en 1983, d'abord comme secr\u00e9taire. En 1992, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tudier pour obtenir un baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9ducation, avec une sp\u00e9cialisation en \u00e9ducation autochtone. Pendant qu'elle \u00e9tudiait pour obtenir son dipl\u00f4me, Mme Bignell-Malcolm a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow en tant que conseill\u00e8re. Elle a termin\u00e9 son baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9ducation en 1998 environ et elle a ensuite poursuivi ses \u00e9tudes pour obtenir un certificat de 5e ann\u00e9e en \u00e9ducation et administration, encore une fois avec une sp\u00e9cialisation en \u00e9ducation autochtone. Mme Bignell-Malcolm a enseign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow de 1995 \u00e0 1999 et elle ensuite commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour le conseil de bande de la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest, \u00e0 Dauphin, au Manitoba, en tant que directrice de l'enseignement. Mme Bignell-Malcolm a continu\u00e9 d'habiter \u00e0 Ebb and Flow et faisait la navette jusqu'\u00e0 Dauphin.\n[11] Vers mai 2003, Mme Bignell-Malcolm a appris que la bande indienne Ebb and Flow cherchait un directeur de l'enseignement pour son \u00e9cole. Une avis d'emploi vacant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9 dans la collectivit\u00e9. Mme Bignell-Malcolm a affirm\u00e9 avoir examin\u00e9 les exigences du poste \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans l'avis et avoir su qu'elle r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 chacune d'elles. Entre autres, il \u00e9tait exig\u00e9 dans l'avis un dipl\u00f4me universitaire en \u00e9ducation avec une 5e ann\u00e9e en \u00e9ducation et administration et quatre ans d'exp\u00e9rience pr\u00e9alable en administration de l'enseignement. Mme Bignell-Malcolm a pos\u00e9 sa candidature.\n[12] Le 23 juin 2003, Mme Bignell-Malcolm a eu droit \u00e0 une entrevue pour le poste. \u00c9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 cette entrevue le chef de bande, les quatre membres du conseil de bande, les quatre membres du comit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9ducation de la bande, ainsi qu'au moins un des a\u00een\u00e9s de la collectivit\u00e9. Mme Bignell-Malcolm a d\u00e9crit l'entrevue comme une exp\u00e9rience tr\u00e8s positive. Pendant pr\u00e8s d'une heure, elle a fait part de ses r\u00e9flexions et de sa vision pour l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow et le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9ducation. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que l'entrevue s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9e sur un ton tr\u00e8s amical.\n[13] Le 10 juillet 2003, Mme Bignell-Malcolm a appris qu'on lui offrait le poste. Ralph Beaulieu, le chef de la bande indienne Ebb and Flow, lui avait \u00e9crit pour l'informer qu'on lui offrait le poste de directrice de l'enseignement. Le chef a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 Mme Bignell-Malcolm qu'elle entrerait en fonction le 1er ao\u00fbt 2003 et qu'une r\u00e9union aurait lieu plus tard au mois de juillet pour discuter des conditions de son emploi, notamment son salaire. Il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question d'\u00e9chelle salariale dans l'avis ou l'offre d'emploi. Mme Bignell-Malcolm a \u00e9crit au conseil de bande de la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest pour remettre sa d\u00e9mission, laquelle prendrait effet le 1er ao\u00fbt 2003.\n[14] \u00c0 la mi-juillet 2003, Mme Bignell-Malcolm a re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique d'une amie et ancienne coll\u00e8gue de l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow. Son amie lui a communiqu\u00e9 des rumeurs qu'elle avait entendues selon lesquelles le chef et le conseil de bande auraient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'offrir \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm un salaire beaucoup moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui auquel elle pourrait s'attendre \u00e0 recevoir compte tenu du poste, de sa scolarit\u00e9 et de son exp\u00e9rience. Elle a de plus inform\u00e9 Mme Bignell-Malcolm qu'on lui ferait une offre salariale dans le but de la dissuader d'accepter le poste. Mme Bignell-Malcolm a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage n'avoir pas vraiment pris au s\u00e9rieux ces renseignements. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s avoir eu un entretien qui s'\u00e9tait si bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9 et s'\u00eatre vu offrir le poste et s'\u00eatre fait accueillir par le chef dans le syst\u00e8me scolaire d'Ebb and Flow, elle \u00e9tait certaine qu'on lui offrirait des conditions d'emploi \u00e9quitables, y compris pour ce qui est du salaire.\n[15] Le 23 juillet 2003, Mme Bignell-Malcolm s'est rendue \u00e0 une autre r\u00e9union o\u00f9 il devait \u00eatre discut\u00e9 de ses conditions d'emploi. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a affirm\u00e9 \u00eatre arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9union \u00e0 midi, heure \u00e0 laquelle la r\u00e9union devait d\u00e9buter selon ce qu'on lui avait dit, et avoir d\u00fb attendre pendant pr\u00e8s de deux heures avant d'\u00eatre invit\u00e9e \u00e0 entrer dans la salle o\u00f9 se tenait la r\u00e9union. Encore une fois, le chef, les conseillers de bande et les membres du comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9ducation \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents. Mme Houle, la directrice de l'enseignement par int\u00e9rim \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sente, ainsi qu'au moins un des a\u00een\u00e9s. Mme Bignell-Malcolm a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'atmosph\u00e8re de cette r\u00e9union, contrairement \u00e0 l'entretien du 23 juin 2003, \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s tendue. La r\u00e9union n'a pas commenc\u00e9 par une pri\u00e8re, alors que c'est la coutume dans la collectivit\u00e9. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que le chef Beaulieu l'a inform\u00e9e que la bande lui offrait un salaire de 52 000 $ par ann\u00e9e. Mme Bignell-Malcolm a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 estomaqu\u00e9e par cette offre. Elle gagnait 60 000 $ par ann\u00e9e en tant que directrice de l'enseignement pour le conseil de bande de la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest. Elle savait \u00e9galement que l'ancien directeur de l'enseignement de l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow recevait un salaire annuel sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 60 000 $ et elle savait qu'au moins un des conseillers scolaires de l'\u00e9cole, un employ\u00e9 beaucoup moins bien plac\u00e9 dans la hi\u00e9rarchie, gagnait 58 000 $ par ann\u00e9e. Mme Bignell-Malcolm a fait part de ses r\u00e9serves au sujet du niveau de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et a propos\u00e9 d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9e 72 000 $. On lui a demand\u00e9 de quitter la salle pour permettre aux autres personnes pr\u00e9sentes de discuter de la question de son salaire.\n[16] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Bignell-Malcolm, lorsqu'elle est revenue dans la salle de r\u00e9union, le chef Beaulieu lui a dit abruptement : [traduction] L'offre est de 55 000 $. C'est \u00e0 prendre ou \u00e0 laisser. Elle a affirm\u00e9 avoir accept\u00e9 l'emploi sur-le-champ. Elle avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste de directrice de l'enseignement pour le conseil de bande de la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest et elle sentait qu'elle n'avait pas le choix d'accepter le poste, bien qu'elle pens\u00e2t que le salaire \u00e9tait ind\u00fbment bas. Le chef lui a dit qu'il lui donnait jusqu'au vendredi 25 juillet 2003 pour accepter l'offre par \u00e9crit. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, le lendemain, le 24 juillet 2003, elle a donn\u00e9 sa lettre d'acceptation \u00e0 son mari, Robert Malcolm, qui travaillait au bureau du conseil de bande, et lui a demand\u00e9 de l'apporter au bureau du chef. Une copie de la lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite en preuve \u00e0 l'audience. La lettre comporte un sceau qui indique que le bureau du conseil de bande l'a re\u00e7ue le 24 juillet 2003.\n[17] Le 24 juillet 2003, \u00e0 23 h, selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Bignell-Malcolm, le chef Beaulieu lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 chez elle, ce qui l'a r\u00e9veill\u00e9e. Le chef l'a inform\u00e9e que l'offre d'emploi \u00e9tait annul\u00e9e. Il ne lui a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi. Par contre, il a mentionn\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u une p\u00e9tition de certains r\u00e9sidents de la collectivit\u00e9 en laissant entendre, selon ce qu'elle a compris, que cette p\u00e9tition \u00e9tait, du moins en partie, la raison pour laquelle il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'annuler l'offre d'emploi. Le chef ne lui a pas lu la p\u00e9tition et ne lui en a pas r\u00e9sum\u00e9 le contenu.\n[18] Le poste de directeur de l'enseignement a continu\u00e9 d'\u00eatre occup\u00e9 par Mme Houle, qui \u00e9tait alors directrice de l'enseignement par int\u00e9rim. Mme Houle d\u00e9tenait un dipl\u00f4me de quatre ans en \u00e9ducation et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conseill\u00e8re scolaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Mme Houle n'avait ni formation ni exp\u00e9rience en administration de l'\u00e9ducation. Elle \u00e9tait ojibway. La bande a continu\u00e9 d'annoncer le poste de directeur de l'enseignement et a finalement embauch\u00e9 Arlene Mousseau \u00e0 ce poste. Mme Mousseau avait un baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9ducation. Cependant, elle n'avait pas le certificat de 5e ann\u00e9e en \u00e9ducation et administration qu'avait Mme Bignell-Malcolm, une exigence annonc\u00e9e pour le poste, et elle n'avait pas autant d'exp\u00e9rience que Mme Bignell-Malcolm que ce soit en enseignement ou en administration. Mme Mousseau n'\u00e9tait pas crie. Elle \u00e9tait ojibway.\n[19] J'estime que l'acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 prima facie de ces seuls faits. La plaignante, Mme Bignell-Malcolm, a produit une preuve \u00e0 l'appui des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. D'abord, elle \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e pour le poste de directrice de l'enseignement de l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow. Ensuite, elle a postul\u00e9 au poste et sa candidature n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue. Mme Houle, qui a continu\u00e9 d'occuper le poste en tant que directrice de l'enseignement par int\u00e9rim, n'\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e et n'\u00e9tait pas d'origine crie. Mme Houle ne partageait pas la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique de Mme Bignell-Malcolm. L'intim\u00e9e a continu\u00e9 d'annoncer le poste vacant, auquel a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e Mme Mousseau. Cette derni\u00e8re n'\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e pour le poste et, encore une fois, parce qu'elle \u00e9tait ojibway, elle ne partageait pas la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique de Mme Bignell-Malcolm.\nPreuve suppl\u00e9mentaire\n[20] Bien que Mme Bignell-Malcolm n'en e\u00fbt pas besoin pour prouver prima facie l'acte discriminatoire, la plaignante a produit d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l'audience qui seront pertinents dans le cadre de mon analyse visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si l'explication de l'intim\u00e9e au sujet de son acte \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue discriminatoire \u00e9tait raisonnable. Je pr\u00e9sente ici ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 des fins de clart\u00e9 de l'expos\u00e9.\n[21] Mme Bignell-Malcolm, avant de d\u00e9poser la plainte en l'esp\u00e8ce, a retenu les services d'un avocat et a entam\u00e9 une poursuite civile pour cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l'annulation de l'offre d'emploi. Dans le cadre de cette proc\u00e9dure, Mme Bignell-Malcolm a re\u00e7u une copie de la p\u00e9tition mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. En outre, l'avocat de Mme Bignell-Malcolm a interrog\u00e9 Mme Houle dans le cadre de la divulgation pr\u00e9alable de la poursuite civile et la transcription de cet interrogatoire de m\u00eame que la p\u00e9tition ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites en preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Bignell-Malcolm a affirm\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Houle et apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincue qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination et elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte. Je n'ai pas entendu de t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9cisant o\u00f9 en \u00e9tait rendue la poursuite pour cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9 au moment de l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[22] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a soutenu que ni la p\u00e9tition ni la transcription n'\u00e9taient des preuves admissibles devant le Tribunal. J'estime cependant, pour les motifs suivants, que tant la p\u00e9tition que la transcription de l'interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable de Mme Houle sont admissibles.\n[23] Il existe un principe d'application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale au contentieux civil selon lequel la preuve obtenue dans le cadre d'une proc\u00e9dure est confidentielle et ne peut \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9e \u00e0 des fins autres que celles de la proc\u00e9dure dans le cadre de laquelle la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue (Lac d'Amiante du Qu\u00e9bec Lt\u00e9e c. 2858-0702 Qu\u00e9bec Inc., [2001] 2 R.C.S. 743 (Lac d' Amiante ), et J-Sons Inc. c. N.M. Paterson & Sons Ltd., [2003] M.J. no 461 (C.A.) (J-Sons ). Dans la province du Manitoba, o\u00f9 Mme Bignell-Malcolm a intent\u00e9 sa poursuite pour cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9, ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 codifi\u00e9 au paragraphe 30.1(3) des R\u00e8gles de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, R\u00e8glement du Manitoba 553\/88, modifi\u00e9. Selon cette disposition, toutes les parties et leurs avocats sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s s'\u00eatre engag\u00e9s \u00e0 ne pas utiliser \u00e0 d'autres fins les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus.\n[24] Au contentieux civil, le processus de communication entrepris avant le proc\u00e8s sur le fond permet aux parties adverses d'obliger l'autre \u00e0 divulguer des documents et \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des questions, qu'elle le veuille ou non. Cette atteinte au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est r\u00e9put\u00e9e n\u00e9cessaire avant le proc\u00e8s pour rendre justice. Cependant, les fruits de la communication pr\u00e9alable ne peuvent servir que dans le cadre de cette proc\u00e9dure et doivent par ailleurs demeurer confidentiels. Il est inacceptable de les utiliser \u00e0 toute autre fin ou dans le cadre de toute autre proc\u00e9dure (voir la d\u00e9cision J-Sons, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et l'arr\u00eat Lac d'Amiante, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9). Ce principe de confidentialit\u00e9 prot\u00e8ge les int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s des individus et pr\u00e9serve l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus du contentieux civil, car sans cette protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, les parties \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure pourraient ne pas divulguer tous les faits pertinents dans le cadre de la poursuite. Les personnes ayant contrevenu \u00e0 ce principe de confidentialit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9es coupables d'outrage au tribunal (N.M. Paterson & Sons Ltd. c. Corporation de gestion de la voie maritime du Saint-Laurent, [2002] A.C.F. no 1713, conf. par [2004]A.C.F. no 946 (C.A.F.)).\n[25] Bien que la LCDP dispense le Tribunal des r\u00e8gles habituelles du droit de la preuve (alin\u00e9a 50(3)c)), le paragraphe 50(4) pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal ne peut admettre en preuve les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui sont confidentiels devant les tribunaux judiciaires. D'apr\u00e8s ce que je comprends de l'arr\u00eat Lac d'Amiante, particuli\u00e8rement du paragraphe 42, le principe de confidentialit\u00e9 constitue un privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9. Le juge LeBel, quand il analyse l'origine en common law du principe de confidentialit\u00e9, \u00e9crit que, lorsque la preuve est pertinente et qu'elle n'est pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par quelque autre forme de privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9, elle peut \u00eatre produite et le principe de confidentialit\u00e9 est engag\u00e9. Aux fins de l'analyse suivante, je vais pr\u00e9sumer, sans en d\u00e9cider, que le principe de confidentialit\u00e9 est une forme de privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9.\n[26] Cependant, le principe de la confidentialit\u00e9 n'est pas sans limite. Dans l'arr\u00eat Lac d'Amiante, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, bien que le principe de confidentialit\u00e9 soit essentiel pour prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et pr\u00e9server l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me du contentieux civil, il convient de faire des exceptions en certaines circonstances.\n[27] Une exception au principe de confidentialit\u00e9 relev\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Lac d'Amiante se pr\u00e9sente dans le contexte d'une mise en cause. Il peut \u00eatre conclu que la r\u00e8gle de la confidentialit\u00e9 ne s'applique pas lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9montrer dans un autre proc\u00e8s qu'un t\u00e9moin a donn\u00e9 des versions contradictoires d'un m\u00eame fait (Lac d'Amiante, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 77). Cette exception a \u00e9t\u00e9 codifi\u00e9e dans les R\u00e8gles du Manitoba. Le paragraphe 30.1(6) des R\u00e8gles dispose que la pr\u00e9somption de confidentialit\u00e9 n'a pas pour effet d'interdire l'utilisation d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus au cours d'une instance afin que soit attaqu\u00e9e la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d'une personne qui t\u00e9moigne dans une autre instance.\n[28] La transcription de l'interrogatoire de Mme Houle a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite dans le but de mettre en cause son t\u00e9moignage et, en cons\u00e9quence, cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve est admissible en tant qu'exception au principe de confidentialit\u00e9.\n[29] Voici un extrait pertinent de la transcription de l'interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable de Mme Houle :\n[traduction]\nQ : Parlez-vous le saulteux?\nR : Oui, je le parle couramment.\nQ : Quelle langue utilisent les enseignants quand ils sont en classe? L'anglais ou le saulteux?\nR : L'anglais et nous avons un programme d'\u00e9tudes autochtones, de langue autochtone. Et c'est une des raisons pour lesquelles les a\u00een\u00e9s n'ont pas vraiment accept\u00e9 Jean, parce qu'elle est crie et personne d'entre nous n'est cri. Nous sommes tous ojibway.\nQ : Donc, les a\u00een\u00e9s n'aimaient pas l'id\u00e9e d'avoir une personne crie de culture crie en tant que directrice de l'enseignement?\nR : Oui, ils se demandaient aussi comment nous allions communiquer avec elle si elle ne parle m\u00eame pas notre langue.\nQ : Les a\u00een\u00e9s, je pr\u00e9sume, parlent au moins un peu l'anglais?\nR : Un peu.\n[30] Une deuxi\u00e8me exception \u00e0 ce principe veut qu'un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve puisse \u00eatre jug\u00e9 admissible dans une autre proc\u00e9dure lorsqu'il en va de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice (Lac d'Amiante, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 76). Cette exception a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 codifi\u00e9e dans les R\u00e8gles du Manitoba. Le paragraphe 30.1(8) des R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voit que le tribunal peut ordonner que la pr\u00e9somption de confidentialit\u00e9 ne s'applique pas s'il est convaincu que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice l'emporterait sur tout pr\u00e9judice que pourrait subir une partie.\n[31] J'estime que la p\u00e9tition est admissible, car elle sert l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice. D'abord, la p\u00e9tition est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve de nature \u00e0 tendre \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'une question de discrimination est entr\u00e9e en jeu dans la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e d'annuler l'offre d'emploi faite \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm. L'objet de la disposition pertinente de la LCDP est d'\u00e9liminer toute discrimination dans le domaine de l'emploi. Il est reconnu depuis longtemps que l'objet de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne est la protection des droits fondamentaux de la personne, un objet d'une importance capitale pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne (Zurich Insurance Corp. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [1992] 2 R.C.S. 321, au paragraphe 57). Admettre un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui tendrait \u00e0 montrer qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire sert un but d'importance capitale et sert l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice.\n[32] Apr\u00e8s avoir pond\u00e9r\u00e9 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice par rapport \u00e0 tout pr\u00e9judice que pourrait subir l'intim\u00e9e si ce document devait \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9, j'estime que la divulgation l'emporte. Pour tirer cette conclusion, je prends note que la p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement diffus\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s des a\u00een\u00e9s de la collectivit\u00e9 d'Ebb and Flow et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 un enfant pour \u00eatre remise au chef en public. Je remarque \u00e9galement que la p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 jointe en annexe au compte rendu de la r\u00e9union du chef et du conseil de bande qui a eu lieu le 25 juillet 2003, r\u00e9union au cours de laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'annuler l'offre d'emploi. Il ne semble pas que ce document ait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re donnant \u00e0 penser qu'il devait demeurer confidentiel.\n[33] En outre, une p\u00e9tition est un document de nature plut\u00f4t publique. Les p\u00e9titions, comme celles en l'esp\u00e8ce, sont une demande ou une pri\u00e8re adress\u00e9e par ses signataires \u00e0 une instance dirigeante, \u00e0 une collectivit\u00e9 publique, dans l'espoir que cette instance dirigeante, en l'esp\u00e8ce le chef et le conseil de bande, interviendra d'une certaine mani\u00e8re. Ce document n'est pas du type que l'on peut consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant confidentiel dans la plupart des circonstances. J'estime que l'intim\u00e9e subirait un faible pr\u00e9judice de la divulgation de la p\u00e9tition et que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice l'emporte sur tout pr\u00e9judice que l'intim\u00e9e pourrait subir. J'estime pour ces motifs que le document est admissible dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.\n[34] Une partie pertinente de la p\u00e9tition est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e ainsi : [traduction] Il a fallu de nombreuses ann\u00e9es au chef et au conseil pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents pour prendre en main notre syst\u00e8me scolaire et on nous a promis qu'il reviendrait toujours \u00e0 notre peuple d'administrer notre programme d'\u00e9ducation. Jean ne parle m\u00eame pas notre langue. En tant qu'a\u00een\u00e9s, nous prot\u00e9geons notre programme d'\u00e9ducation. Est-ce que l'interpr\u00e8te sera fourni quand nous aurons \u00e0 parler \u00e0 Jean?\n[35] Les R\u00e8gles du Manitoba concernant le principe de confidentialit\u00e9 pr\u00e9voient que la partie souhaitant produire la preuve devra demander \u00e0 l'avance l'autorisation du Tribunal pour d\u00e9poser un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 produit dans une autre instance. La plaignante ne l'a pas fait. Il est possible que l'intim\u00e9e puisse disposer d'un recours devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine du Manitoba. Cependant, je ne crois pas que le fait que la plaignante n'ait pas demand\u00e9 une telle autorisation au pr\u00e9alable signifie que le Tribunal ne peut pas admettre l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve s'il est convaincu que sont admission convient dans les circonstances, comme je l'ai fait compte tenu des faits dont je suis saisi.\nb) L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fourni une explication raisonnable pour son acte \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue discriminatoire?\n[36] Puisqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire, il incombe maintenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de fournir une explication raisonnable justifiant son acte apparemment discriminatoire. Il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9futer la preuve prima facie de la plaignante en fournissant une explication raisonnable justifiant sa d\u00e9cision d'annuler l'offre d'emploi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm. (Morris c. Canada (forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [2005] A.C.F. no 731, au paragraphe 36 (C.A.), Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., [2004] A.C.F. no 941, au paragraphe 23 (C.A.))\n[37] La preuve pertinente que l'intim\u00e9e a produite au sujet de son explication \u00e9tait la suivante.\nPreuve de l'intim\u00e9e\n[38] Charles Cochrane a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. M. Cochrane a \u00e9t\u00e9 le premier directeur de l'enseignement de l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 titulaire du poste de 1997 \u00e0 2003. D'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de M. Cochrane, la bande a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'administrer directement son syst\u00e8me scolaire. Le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord \u00e9tait auparavant charg\u00e9 de l'administration de l'\u00e9cole locale. M. Cochrane a affirm\u00e9 que, entre 1995 et 2003, de vastes consultations ont eu lieu dans la collectivit\u00e9 pendant que la politique en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9ducation de la collectivit\u00e9 \u00e9tait mise au point. Le guide de la politique d'\u00e9ducation a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 en janvier 2003.\n[39] M. Cochrane a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, durant cette p\u00e9riode de vastes consultations, la collectivit\u00e9 a clairement laiss\u00e9 savoir qu'elle voulait absolument que le directeur de l'enseignement de l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow parle couramment le saulteux.\n[40] Le chef Beaulieu a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Le chef a affirm\u00e9 que l'avis du poste de directeur de l'enseignement \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 inclure l'exigence de la ma\u00eetrise de la langue ojibway, mais que cette exigence avait \u00e9t\u00e9 omise. Le chef a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette exigence linguistique \u00e9tait une attente largement r\u00e9pandue dans la collectivit\u00e9 : la collectivit\u00e9 s'attend \u00e0 ce que le directeur de l'enseignement de l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow parle le saulteux. Le chef Beaulieu a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait l'administrateur de bande, Robert Malcolm, qui avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 l'avis et que le chef ne l'avait pas r\u00e9vis\u00e9 avant sa diffusion. Robert Malcolm est le mari de Mme Bignell-Malcolm et le chef a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, bien que cette omission ait pu \u00eatre une erreur, il soup\u00e7onnait M. Malcolm d'avoir d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment omis l'exigence linguistique pour que son \u00e9pouse puisse avoir une chance d'obtenir le poste m\u00eame si elle ne parlait pas saulteux et n'\u00e9tait donc pas qualifi\u00e9e.\n[41] Le chef Beaulieu a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lors de l'entretien avec les candidats, aucune question n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e quant \u00e0 leur ma\u00eetrise du saulteux. Le chef a affirm\u00e9 que chacun des intervieweurs avait re\u00e7u une liste des questions \u00e0 poser \u00e0 chacun des candidats. Cette liste ne comprenait aucune question o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait demand\u00e9 au candidat s'il parlait couramment le saulteux. La liste de questions avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dress\u00e9e par M. Malcolm, l'administrateur de bande, et, encore une fois, l'omission serait le fruit d'une erreur involontaire ou volontaire de M. Malcolm. Selon le chef, l'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm en raison de ses qualifications et de son rendement \u00e0 l'entrevue sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux des autres candidats. Puisque la question de la langue n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Mme Bignell-Malcolm \u00e9tait la personne la plus qualifi\u00e9e. Si une des personnes participant au processus d'entrevue et de s\u00e9lection des candidats s'\u00e9tait rappel\u00e9 que la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux \u00e9tait une exigence du poste de directeur de l'enseignement, Mme Bignell-Malcolm ne se serait pas vu offrir le poste.\n[42] Le chef a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la r\u00e9union du 23 juillet 2003 s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9e sur un ton acrimonieux. Le chef ne se rappelait pas si Mme Bignell-Malcolm avait d\u00fb attendre pendant deux heures avant d'\u00eatre invit\u00e9e \u00e0 entrer. Il a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Bignell-Malcolm s'\u00e9tait montr\u00e9e impolie d\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Bignell-Malcolm a annonc\u00e9 d\u00e8s son entr\u00e9e dans la pi\u00e8ce qu'elle ne collaborerait pas avec le comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9ducation. Selon le t\u00e9moignage du chef, elle l'a point\u00e9 du doigt agressivement en d\u00e9clarant : [traduction] Je ne parlerai qu'\u00e0 vous. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 choqu\u00e9 par la conduite de Mme Bignell-Malcolm \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Bignell-Malcolm s'\u00e9tait d'abord vu offrir 52 000 $ par an et que Mme Bignell-Malcolm a soutenu que le salaire \u00e9tait bien trop faible. Il en a discut\u00e9 plus amplement avec les autres personnes pr\u00e9sentes et a augment\u00e9 l'offre \u00e0 55 000 $ par an. Il a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Bignell-Malcolm n'a pas accept\u00e9 l'emploi lors de la r\u00e9union. Il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 jusqu'au vendredi 25 juillet 2003 pour examiner l'offre et donner une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite.\n[43] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le chef a affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne lui \u00e9tait pas venu \u00e0 l'esprit avant le soir du 24 juillet 2003 que, puisqu'elle ne parlait pas le saulteux, Mme Bignell-Malcolm n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9e pour le poste de directeur de l'enseignement. Ce soir-l\u00e0, selon ce qu'il a affirm\u00e9, il jouait au billard avec son fr\u00e8re. Une jeune fille de la collectivit\u00e9 est entr\u00e9e dans la salle de billard et lui a remis la p\u00e9tition dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs. Le chef a affirm\u00e9 que, en lisant la p\u00e9tition, il s'est rendu compte que l'erreur avait men\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation d'une offre d'emploi \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm. Le chef a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'est imm\u00e9diatement rendu chez son p\u00e8re. Celui-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le chef de la bande indienne Ebb and Flow pendant vingt ans avant que le chef Beaulieu prenne la rel\u00e8ve. Le p\u00e8re du chef Beaulieu avait sign\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition. Le chef Beaulieu a affirm\u00e9 avoir demand\u00e9 l'avis de son p\u00e8re et que ce dernier lui a conseill\u00e9 d'\u00e9couter les a\u00een\u00e9s. Le chef a affirm\u00e9 avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de suivre l'avis de son p\u00e8re : il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'\u00e9couter les a\u00een\u00e9s et d'annuler l'offre d'emploi parce que la p\u00e9tition lui a rappel\u00e9 que la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux \u00e9tait une exigence du poste de directeur de l'enseignement et que, pour cette raison, Mme Bignell-Malcolm n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9e pour le poste. Le chef nie avoir tenu compte de la race ou de l'origine nationale ou ethnique en prenant cette d\u00e9cision. La langue \u00e9tait la seule consid\u00e9ration.\n[44] Le chef Beaulieu a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 aux membres du conseil de bande. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de joindre deux des quatre conseillers et les deux auxquels il a parl\u00e9 \u00e9taient d'accord pour que l'offre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm soit annul\u00e9e parce que celle-ci ne ma\u00eetrisait pas l'ojibway. Le chef a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu l'approbation de la majorit\u00e9 du chef et du conseil de bande, il a imm\u00e9diatement t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm pour l'informer que l'offre \u00e9tait annul\u00e9e. Le lendemain, le chef et les conseillers se sont r\u00e9unis au bureau de la bande et ont ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 formellement la d\u00e9cision. Le chef a affirm\u00e9 ne pas avoir re\u00e7u la lettre dans laquelle Mme Bignell-Malcolm acceptait le poste avant le lundi 28 juillet 2003. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ne pas savoir pourquoi la lettre portait un sceau indiquant que le bureau de la bande l'avait re\u00e7ue le 24 juillet 2003. Il a affirm\u00e9 que M. Malcolm, l'administrateur de bande et le mari de Mme Bignell-Malcolm, a peut-\u00eatre appos\u00e9 sur la lettre un sceau comportant une date inexacte.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e est-elle raisonnable?\n[45] J'estime que, si l'explication de l'intim\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9dible, elle aurait pu \u00eatre raisonnable. Cependant, pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que l'explication pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e n'est pas cr\u00e9dible et que, par cons\u00e9quent, l'intim\u00e9e ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de r\u00e9futer la preuve prima facie de la plaignante \u00e9tablissant qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire.\n[46] L'explication fournie par l'intim\u00e9e comporte deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments cl\u00e9s. Le premier est que la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux \u00e9tait une exigence du poste de directeur de l'enseignement. Le second est que le chef et le conseil ont annul\u00e9 l'offre le 24 juillet 2003, car c'\u00e9tait la date \u00e0 laquelle le chef a lu la p\u00e9tition des a\u00een\u00e9s et s'est rappel\u00e9 que la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux \u00e9tait une exigence du poste. Pour les motifs qui suivent, j'estime d'abord que la preuve indique que la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux n'\u00e9tait pas une exigence du poste de directeur de l'enseignement quand le poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm. Ensuite, je conclus que la preuve indique que la d\u00e9cision d'annuler l'offre d'emploi n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise le 24 juillet 2003, comme l'a affirm\u00e9 le chef, mais avant cette date.\nLa ma\u00eetrise du saulteux n'est pas une exigence du poste\n[47] Pour conclure que, selon la preuve, la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux n'\u00e9tait pas une exigence du poste de directeur de l'enseignement au moment o\u00f9 l'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm, j'observe d'abord que le guide de la politique d'\u00e9ducation ne pr\u00e9cise pas que le poste de directeur de l'enseignement ne peut \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 une personne parlant couramment le saulteux. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Cochrane a \u00e9mis l'hypoth\u00e8se que l'exigence linguistique a probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 omise parce que, au moment des consultations avec la collectivit\u00e9, il \u00e9tait le directeur de l'enseignement et il parlait couramment le saulteux. On s'attendait \u00e0 ce qu'il occupe le poste pendant encore de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, alors l'exigence linguistique a \u00e9t\u00e9 oubli\u00e9e. Cependant, M. Cochrane, dans son t\u00e9moignage, a d\u00e9crit son r\u00f4le lors des consultations aupr\u00e8s de la collectivit\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant en grande partie celui d'un transcripteur. Il a affirm\u00e9 avoir \u00e9cout\u00e9 les consultations et avoir consign\u00e9 les conclusions tir\u00e9es et les orientations adopt\u00e9es. Si la collectivit\u00e9 avait express\u00e9ment affirm\u00e9 qu'elle souhaitait que le poste de directeur de l'enseignement soit obligatoirement occup\u00e9 par une personne parlant couramment le saulteux, et si le travail de M. Cochrane consistait, comme il l'a d\u00e9crit, en grande partie \u00e0 transcrire les directives de la collectivit\u00e9, on pourrait s'attendre \u00e0 ce que l'exigence se trouve dans le guide de politique.\n[48] J'estime \u00e9galement qu'il est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que la question de la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux en tant qu'exigence du poste de directeur de l'enseignement n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e en aucun temps entre la date \u00e0 laquelle Mme Bignell-Malcolm a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9e pour le poste, au d\u00e9but de mai 2003, et le 24 juillet 2003, date \u00e0 laquelle le chef, selon ce qu'il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, s'est finalement souvenu de l'exigence et a annul\u00e9 l'offre d'emploi avec l'approbation de son conseil. Compte tenu des circonstances, quelqu'un devait certainement s'\u00eatre souvenu de l'exigence avant le 24 juillet 2003. D'abord, le document sur la politique d'\u00e9ducation a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 en janvier 2003, \u00e0 peine quelques mois avant que ne soit annonc\u00e9 le poste de directeur de l'enseignement. On s'attendrait \u00e0 ce que le contenu de la politique soit suffisamment r\u00e9cent pour que les gens de la collectivit\u00e9 l'aient encore en m\u00e9moire. M\u00eame si le Tribunal acceptait que l'exigence linguistique ait \u00e9t\u00e9 malencontreusement omise de l'avis d'emploi et de la liste des questions \u00e0 l'entrevue, il est difficile de croire qu'aucune des personnes participant \u00e0 l'entrevue et au processus de s\u00e9lection des candidats ne se soit souvenue de l'exigence avant que le poste soit offert \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm le 10 juillet 2003.\n[49] Je prends note que pas moins d'une douzaine des dirigeants de la collectivit\u00e9 d'Ebb and Flow ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entrevue. Tous les membres du comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9ducation y \u00e9taient, de m\u00eame que le chef, les conseillers et au moins un a\u00een\u00e9. En outre, Mme Bignell-Malcolm habitait depuis longtemps \u00e0 Ebb and Flow, elle s'y impliquait activement et elle avait travaill\u00e9 pour l'\u00e9cole pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Il \u00e9tait sans doute de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique dans la collectivit\u00e9 que Mme Bignell-Malcolm ne parlait pas le saulteux. J'estime que la preuve de l'intim\u00e9e selon laquelle la question de l'exigence linguistique n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e parce qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 malencontreusement omise de l'avis d'emploi et de la liste des questions \u00e0 poser \u00e0 l'entrevue n'est pas cr\u00e9dible. Dans les circonstances, il me semble que, si la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux avait \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9ritablement une exigence du poste, quelqu'un participant \u00e0 l'entrevue et au processus de s\u00e9lection des candidats s'en serait souvenu et l'emploi n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm le 10 juillet 2003.\n[50] Il est \u00e9galement difficile de croire que deux autres semaines s'\u00e9couleraient, du 10 juillet 2003 au 24 juillet 2003, avant que le chef ne se souvienne enfin de l'exigence. J'estime que la conclusion qui peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e de l'ensemble de la preuve relative \u00e0 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'explication de l'intim\u00e9e est que la question de la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux en tant qu'exigence du poste de directeur de l'enseignement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e parce que la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux n'\u00e9tait pas une exigence du poste au moment pertinent.\nQuand l'intim\u00e9e a_t-elle d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Mme Bignell-Malcolm ne devrait pas \u00eatre nomm\u00e9e directrice de l'enseignement?\n[51] J'estime que la preuve est plus compatible avec une conclusion selon laquelle l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'annuler l'offre d'emploi avant le 24 juillet 2003, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'elle soutient.\n[52] Mme Houle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les nouvelles voyagent vite dans la petite collectivit\u00e9 d'Ebb and Flow. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir des appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques peu apr\u00e8s que le poste e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm. Les membres de la collectivit\u00e9, selon son t\u00e9moignage, \u00e9taient f\u00e2ch\u00e9s que le poste de directeur de l'enseignement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm. Elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle a parl\u00e9 au chef Beaulieu lorsqu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir ces appels et qu'il lui a confirm\u00e9 qu'il recevait \u00e9galement de tels appels. Le chef a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne se rappelait pas avoir re\u00e7u d'appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. J'estime que le t\u00e9moignage du chef \u00e0 ce sujet n'est pas cr\u00e9dible et je lui pr\u00e9f\u00e8re celui de Mme Houle. Je crois que le chef a appris peu apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de l'offre le 10 juillet 2003 que des membres de la collectivit\u00e9 n'\u00e9taient pas contents que le poste de directeur de l'enseignement soit offert \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm.\n[53] En outre, tant l'intim\u00e9e que la plaignante conviennent que la r\u00e9union du 23 juillet 2003, une r\u00e9union o\u00f9 devaient \u00eatre finalis\u00e9s les d\u00e9tails de l'embauche de Mme Bignell-Malcolm, s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 sur un ton acrimonieux. Le chef a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Bignell-Malcolm s'est montr\u00e9e impolie, exigeante et d\u00e9raisonnable et qu'elle recherchait la confrontation d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la r\u00e9union. Mme Bignell-Malcolm le nie. On se serait attendu que cette r\u00e9union se d\u00e9roule dans la bonne entente, particuli\u00e8rement au d\u00e9but. Mme Bignell-Malcolm venait de se voir offrir un emploi et devait entrer en fonction la semaine suivante. Pourquoi une personne, qui deviendrait bient\u00f4t la directrice de l'enseignement, lors d'une r\u00e9union \u00e0 laquelle prenaient part les membres du comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9ducation, profiterait de l'occasion pour annoncer qu'elle ne collaborerait pas avec le comit\u00e9? Pourquoi se montrerait-elle impolie et irrespectueuse? De plus, si sa conduite avait \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi inappropri\u00e9e que le d\u00e9crit le chef, on se serait attendu \u00e0 ce que le comit\u00e9 ait pens\u00e9 \u00e0 annuler l'offre \u00e0 ce moment plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 augmenter le salaire propos\u00e9 de 3 000 $ par an. J'estime que la preuve de l'intim\u00e9e au sujet de la conduite de Mme Bignell-Malcolm n'est pas cr\u00e9dible. Une explication plus raisonnable du ton acrimonieux de cette r\u00e9union est que l'intim\u00e9e avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pris la d\u00e9cision avant la r\u00e9union afin d'inciter Mme Bignell-Malcolm \u00e0 refuser le poste en lui offrant un salaire ind\u00fbment bas et en la traitant plut\u00f4t cavali\u00e8rement lors de la r\u00e9union.\n[54] J'estime \u00e9galement qu'il est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que la p\u00e9tition dat\u00e9e du 24 juillet 2003 et remise au chef ce soir-l\u00e0 comporte cette note \u00e0 la fin des signatures : [traduction] J'ai parl\u00e9 aux a\u00een\u00e9s de la collectivit\u00e9, mais en raison de l'AWAKE, de nombreux a\u00een\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e0 la maison. Donc, ils ont accept\u00e9 verbalement de signer, mais ils n'ont pas eu le temps en raison de l'urgence de cette lettre. Je n'ai pas entendu de t\u00e9moignage expliquant ce qu'\u00e9tait l'AWAKE, mais il semble que l'AWAKE soit un \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui ait fait en sorte que des a\u00een\u00e9s ne se trouvaient pas chez eux lorsqu'on a fait circuler la p\u00e9tition. On ne peut que se demander pourquoi la p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e si rapidement apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union acrimonieuse de n\u00e9gociation et pourquoi il y est question du manque de temps. Il semble raisonnable d'en conclure que cette p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union dans le but de fabriquer une excuse permettant au chef et au conseil d'annuler l'offre d'emploi \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm apr\u00e8s que l'intim\u00e9e n'e\u00fbt pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 lui faire refuser l'offre lors de la r\u00e9union du 23 juillet 2003. La mention du temps qui presse laisse entendre que la personne ou les personnes faisant circuler la p\u00e9tition savaient que Mme Bignell-Malcolm avait seulement jusqu'au lendemain pour pr\u00e9senter une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite.\n[55] En outre, j'estime qu'il est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que l'intim\u00e9e n'ait pas dit \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm que l'offre d'emploi \u00e9tait annul\u00e9e parce qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9e. Pourquoi l'intim\u00e9e ne l'aurait-elle pas inform\u00e9e de ce motif? Si la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux \u00e9tait une exigence du poste, une exigence que le comit\u00e9 charg\u00e9 des entretiens et de la s\u00e9lection des candidats a omis par erreur, on s'attendrait \u00e0 ce que l'intim\u00e9e soit franche, admette son erreur et dise \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9e parce qu'elle ne parlait pas le saulteux. L'intim\u00e9e ne l'a pas fait.\n[56] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas fourni d'explication raisonnable pour son acte discriminatoire prima facie. La preuve \u00e9taye la conclusion selon laquelle la ma\u00eetrise du saulteux n'\u00e9tait pas, comme l'affirmait l'intim\u00e9e, une exigence du poste de directeur de l'enseignement au moment pertinent. En outre, la preuve \u00e9taye la conclusion selon laquelle l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Mme Bignell-Malcolm ne serait pas directrice de l'enseignement de l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow, non pas le soir du 24 juillet 2003 comme l'a soutenu l'intim\u00e9e, mais au plus tard lors de la r\u00e9union du 23 juillet 2003. L'explication de l'intim\u00e9e n'est pas cr\u00e9dible et n'est donc pas raisonnable. J'estime que le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces seuls faits.\n[57] Il existe en l'esp\u00e8ce d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve laissant entendre plus express\u00e9ment que l'acte de l'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9sultait, au moins en partie, d'une intention discriminatoire. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont en l'occurrence la transcription de l'interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable de Mme Houle ainsi que la p\u00e9tition, deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n[58] Lors de son interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable, Mme Houle a reconnu que la collectivit\u00e9 acceptait difficilement Mme Bignell-Malcolm parce qu'elle \u00e9tait crie et parce qu'elle ne parlait pas la langue locale. Dans le cadre de son t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal, Mme Houle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle voulait dire lors de son interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable que les a\u00een\u00e9s s'inqui\u00e9taient du fait que Mme Bignell-Malcolm \u00e9tait crie uniquement parce qu'ils seraient incapables de communiquer avec elle.\n[59] J'estime que la transcription met effectivement en cause le t\u00e9moignage donn\u00e9 par Mme Houle \u00e0 l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce. La transcription contient le t\u00e9moignage sous serment donn\u00e9 par Mme Houle dans le cadre d'une proc\u00e9dure introduite avant que Mme Bignell-Malcolm ne d\u00e9pose sa plainte dans laquelle elle all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de sa race et de son origine nationale ou ethnique. Lors de l'interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable, Mme Houle n'aurait eu aucune raison de ne pas relater v\u00e9ridiquement et exactement les r\u00e9serves formul\u00e9es par les a\u00een\u00e9s. Pour ces motifs, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage donn\u00e9 par Mme Houle lors de l'interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. J'estime que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve soutient la conclusion selon laquelle la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e d'annuler l'offre d'emploi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, du moins en partie, sur des consid\u00e9rations d'ordre discriminatoire.\n[60] J'estime \u00e9galement que la p\u00e9tition \u00e9taye la conclusion d'intention discriminatoire. Dans la p\u00e9tition, les a\u00een\u00e9s ne font pas part d'une, mais de deux objections \u00e0 l'embauche de Mme Bignell-Malcolm au poste de directrice de l'enseignement. La p\u00e9tition fait part d'une premi\u00e8re objection concernant l'incapacit\u00e9 de Mme Bignell-Malcolm de parler le saulteux, mais elle pr\u00e9sente \u00e9galement une seconde objection d\u00e9coulant du fait que Mme Bignell-Malcolm [traduction] ne fait pas partie de notre peuple . En fait, les mots utilis\u00e9s \u00e9taient ceux-ci : [traduction] [...] il reviendrait toujours \u00e0 notre peuple d'administrer notre programme d'\u00e9ducation. Jean ne parle m\u00eame pas notre langue. Ce libell\u00e9 donne \u00e0 penser que le souci principal des a\u00een\u00e9s \u00e9tait la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique et que la langue \u00e9tait une pr\u00e9occupation secondaire. J'estime que cette p\u00e9tition est un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tayant la conclusion selon laquelle la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, du moins en partie, sur des consid\u00e9rations d'ordre discriminatoire.\nL'argument subsidiaire de l'intim\u00e9e : le programme d'embauche pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentielle des Autochtones\n[61] L'intim\u00e9e a soutenu que, m\u00eame si je concluais que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, en tout ou en partie, sur des consid\u00e9rations de race ou d'origine nationale ou ethnique, sa d\u00e9cision n'\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire en raison du programme d'embauche pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentielle des Autochtones cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Je conclus, pour les motifs qui suivent, que l'intim\u00e9e ne peut invoquer le programme d'embauche pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentielle des Autochtones.\n[62] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a r\u00e9cemment r\u00e9vis\u00e9 et mis \u00e0 jour son programme d'embauche pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentielle des Autochtones. Ce programme a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sur pied en vertu de l'article 16 de la LCDP, lequel autorise un employeur \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des programmes sp\u00e9ciaux destin\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir ou \u00e0 diminuer les d\u00e9savantages d\u00e9coulant de motifs de distinction illicites, comme la race et l'origine nationale ou ethnique. Le programme de la CCDP pr\u00e9voit qu'un employeur ne fait pas preuve de discrimination lorsqu'il r\u00e9serve un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel aux Autochtones dans l'embauche, la promotion ou tout autre aspect li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre essentiellement aux besoins de ces derniers. Le traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel des Autochtones est un moyen qu'un employeur peut invoquer s'il est vis\u00e9 par la plainte d'une personne all\u00e9guant s'\u00eatre vu refuser un emploi parce qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas autochtone.\n[63] J'estime que ce programme ne constitue pas un moyen de d\u00e9fense pour l'intim\u00e9e. D'abord, l'intim\u00e9e a express\u00e9ment ni\u00e9 dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Bignell-Malcolm que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait li\u00e9e de quelque fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique. L'explication avanc\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e uniquement sur la langue. Il est absurde pour l'intim\u00e9e d'affirmer avec insistance qu'elle n'a pas fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique pour ensuite soutenir \u00e0 titre subsidiaire que, si elle l'a fait, elle l'a fait en application d'un programme sp\u00e9cial qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 dans la collectivit\u00e9. Ces arguments ne peuvent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 titre subsidiaire l'un de l'autre, car ils sont totalement incompatibles.\n[64] En outre, le programme de la Commission pr\u00e9voit l'embauche pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentielle de personnes autochtones par rapport \u00e0 des personnes non autochtones. Le programme autorise les employeurs \u00e0 exiger des candidats \u00e0 un emploi qu'ils d\u00e9montrent leurs connaissances ou leur exp\u00e9rience en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la langue, la culture, l'histoire et les coutumes d'une Premi\u00e8re nation, d'une bande ou d'une tribu d\u00e9termin\u00e9e lorsque ces qualifications sont directement reli\u00e9es aux exigences du poste. Il n'est pas permis, en vertu de ce programme, d'accorder la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux membres d'une Premi\u00e8re nation, d'une bande ou d'une tribu d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. La Commission \u00e9tablit un juste \u00e9quilibre. Le programme reconna\u00eet les d\u00e9savantages historiques dont ont souffert les Autochtones ainsi que l'importance de redresser les torts pass\u00e9s et de pr\u00e9server le patrimoine culturel et l'autonomie des peuples des Premi\u00e8res nations. Cependant, le programme n'autorise pas les membres de Premi\u00e8res nations \u00e0 commettre des actes discriminatoires les uns envers les autres en raison de leur appartenance \u00e0 une Premi\u00e8re nation, \u00e0 une bande ou \u00e0 une tribu.\nL'argument subsidiaire de l'intim\u00e9e : l'exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e\n[65] L'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement soutenu \u00e0 titre subsidiaire que, si le Tribunal devait conclure que la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e de ne pas embaucher Mme Bignell-Malcolm avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise au moins en partie en raison de la race ou de l'origine nationale ou ethnique, exiger alors que le directeur de l'enseignement ma\u00eetrise le saulteux constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e du poste de directeur de l'enseignement. J'estime que ce moyen ne s'applique pas aux faits en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[66] La langue se distingue de la race et de l'origine nationale ou ethnique. Une personne d'origine ojibway peut parler ou non le saulteux. Une personne d'origine crie peut parler ou non le saulteux. La ma\u00eetrise d'une langue ne peut en soi constituer une exigence professionnelle justifiant un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique.\nConclusion\n[67] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessus, je conclus que la plainte est fond\u00e9e.\nIV. R\u00c9PARATIONS a) Indemnisation pour perte de salaire\n[68] Mme Bignell-Malcolm demande une indemnit\u00e9 pour le salaire qu'elle a perdu entre le 1er septembre 2003 et le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2006, comme le lui permet l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) autorise le Tribunal, s'il juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9 ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire.\n[69] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s'est r\u00e9cemment pench\u00e9e sur l'analyse qu'il convient d'utiliser pour fixer l'indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire. Dans l'arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2007] A.C.F. no 1134, le juge Pelletier, s'exprimant au nom de la Cour, a affirm\u00e9 que le principal \u00e9l\u00e9ment dont il faut tenir compte est d'\u00e9tablir s'il existe un lien de cause \u00e0 effet entre l'acte discriminatoire et les pertes de salaire qui en r\u00e9sulte. Les principes qui limitent le recouvrement par dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au contentieux civil, comme le caract\u00e8re indirect et la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9, ne s'appliquent pas. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) conf\u00e8re au Tribunal un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lorsqu'il examine une demande d'indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire. Cette disposition pr\u00e9cise que le Tribunal peut indemniser une victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction de ses pertes de salaire qui r\u00e9sultent de l'acte discriminatoire, bien qu'il faille user de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en conformit\u00e9 avec certains principes (Chopra, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 37). En outre, bien que le Tribunal puisse tenir compte du fait que la victime a pris des mesures pour limiter ses pertes, il n'est pas tenu de prendre ce facteur en consid\u00e9ration. Le Tribunal peut en tenir compte s'il juge que les circonstances le justifient.\n[70] Mme Bignell-Malcolm s'est trouv\u00e9e du travail peu apr\u00e8s que l'intim\u00e9e e\u00fbt refus\u00e9 de l'embaucher. Elle a d\u00fb trouver un emploi \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la collectivit\u00e9 d'Ebb and Flow et a d\u00fb faire la navette. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 moins bien r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e pour ces postes qu'elle l'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pour le poste de directeur de l'enseignement \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole d'Ebb and Flow, un poste qu'elle avait accept\u00e9 au salaire de 55 000 $. De septembre 2003 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2006, Mme Bignell-Malcolm a travaill\u00e9 pour cinq employeurs diff\u00e9rents. La seule interruption importante dans son emploi a eu lieu d'avril 2004 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2004. En avril 2004, selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Bignell-Malcolm, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9missionner de son emploi pour l'autorit\u00e9 scolaire de Sioux Valley. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, au printemps 2004, elle voulait aider sa filler \u00e0 planifier son mariage. De plus, elle s'ennuyait de chez elle et se sentait d\u00e9prim\u00e9e. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de quitter son emploi, de retourner chez elle et d'ouvrir un restaurant avec sa fille. Le restaurant n'a pas obtenu de succ\u00e8s et a ferm\u00e9 ses portes \u00e0 la fin de d\u00e9cembre 2004.\n[71] De septembre 2003 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2006, Mme Bignell-Malcolm a gagn\u00e9 un revenu total de 134 330,86 $. Si, pendant ce temps, elle avait travaill\u00e9 en tant que directrice de l'enseignement pour la bande indienne Ebb and Flow au salaire de 55 000 $ par ann\u00e9e, elle aurait gagn\u00e9 187 916,66 $ au total. J'estime \u00e9quitable que Mme Bignell-Malcolm re\u00e7oive une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire. Pour ce qui est du montant, j'ordonne qu'elle re\u00e7oive la diff\u00e9rence entre le revenu qu'elle a touch\u00e9 et celui qu'elle aurait touch\u00e9 du 1er ao\u00fbt 2003, date \u00e0 laquelle elle serait entr\u00e9e en fonction au poste de directrice de l'enseignement pour le syst\u00e8me scolaire d'Ebb and Flow, au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2006. Toutefois, je n'inclus pas d'indemnit\u00e9 pour les mois de mai 2004 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2004, puisque Mme Bignell-Malcolm a volontairement d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son emploi pour faire ce qui l'int\u00e9ressait. Bien qu'il ne soit pas requis, pour le pr\u00e9sent type d'indemnisation, de tenir compte de l'obligation d'att\u00e9nuer ses pertes, j'estime qu'il convient ici d'en tenir compte pour diminuer le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire.\nb) Indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral\n[72] Mme Bignell-Malcolm demande, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP, une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l'acte de l'intim\u00e9e, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 discriminatoire en l'esp\u00e8ce, lui a caus\u00e9 beaucoup de souffrances. Elle a affirm\u00e9 s'\u00eatre mise \u00e0 trembler et s'\u00eatre sentie en \u00e9tat de choc apr\u00e8s l'appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du chef, tard dans la soir\u00e9e, qui l'a r\u00e9veill\u00e9e. Elle a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 avoir souffert d'angoisse caus\u00e9e par l'acte discriminatoire. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que l'angoisse d\u00e9coulait en partie du fait qu'elle ne savait pas pourquoi on avait retir\u00e9 l'offre d'emploi si abruptement, emploi qu'elle d\u00e9sirait vraiment. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9prim\u00e9e, qu'elle a souffert parce qu'elle a encore une fois d\u00fb quitter sa propre collectivit\u00e9 pour trouver du travail. Elle s'ennuyait de chez elle et s'inqui\u00e9tait pour sa famille.\n[73] J'estime que l'acte de l'intim\u00e9e a caus\u00e9 un grave pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm. J'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm 7 000 $ d'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\nc) Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale\n[74] La plaignante r\u00e9clame une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale. Le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'accorder au plus 20 000 $ si le Tribunal vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte de la partie intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Je juge que l'acte commis par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et qu'il \u00e9tait inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Je crois que le chef et le conseil ont annul\u00e9 l'offre d'emploi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Bignell-Malcolm alors qu'ils savaient ou auraient d\u00fb savoir qu'ils commettaient un acte discriminatoire. J'estime que la mani\u00e8re trompeuse dont l'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 laisse croire que l'intim\u00e9e savait dans une certaine mesure que ce qu'elle faisait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. Il convient donc d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale et j'en fixe le montant \u00e0 5 000 $.\nd) Frais juridiques\n[75] La plaignante r\u00e9clame une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer les frais juridiques qu'elles a engag\u00e9es dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. La plaignante demande \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer les frais juridiques engag\u00e9s dans le cadre de sa poursuite pour cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9. Les alin\u00e9as 53(2)c) et 53(2)d) conf\u00e8rent tous deux au Tribunal, lorsqu'il juge une plainte fond\u00e9e, le pouvoir de rendre, entre autres, une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 d'indemniser la victime des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire.\n[76] Le pr\u00e9sident Sinclair a r\u00e9cemment proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen minutieux de la jurisprudence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale portant sur cette question (Mowat c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2006 TCDP 49). Il conclut qu'il se d\u00e9gage de la jurisprudence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour frais juridiques en vertu du paragraphe 53(2).\n[77] Je souscris \u00e0 cette conclusion et je suis de plus convaincu que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour frais juridiques pours les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish (aujourd'hui juge \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) dans sa d\u00e9cision Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel), [2001] D.C.D.P. no 29 (Nkwazi). La pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish note qu'il faut donner \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, compte tenu de son caract\u00e8re fondamental et quasi constitutionnel, une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale conforme \u00e0 son but, non seulement pour ce qui est des droits qu'elle prot\u00e8ge, mais \u00e9galement pour ce qui est des pouvoirs qu'elle conf\u00e8re au Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de redressement (Nkwazi, au paragraphe 13; voir \u00e9galement Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, \u00e0 la page 1136; Robichaud c. La Reine, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84.)\n[78] L'arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Chopra n'aborde pas express\u00e9ment la question des frais juridiques. Il porte sur une r\u00e9clamation pour perte de salaire. Cependant, cet arr\u00eat examine quelle est la bonne interpr\u00e9tation de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), qui est une des dispositions de la LCDP qui conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'octroyer une indemnit\u00e9 pour frais juridiques. Le juge Pelletier conclut que l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel dont il faut tenir compte en rendant une ordonnance en vertu de cette disposition est le lien de cause \u00e0 effet entre les d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es et l'acte discriminatoire. Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme le caract\u00e8re indirect ou la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 ne s'appliquent pas et l'obligation d'att\u00e9nuer ses pertes peut \u00eatre prise en compte, mais il ne s'agit pas d'un \u00e9l\u00e9ment obligatoire de l'analyse. Les d\u00e9cision rendues en vertu de cette disposition rel\u00e8vent toujours d'un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire.\n[79] Apr\u00e8s m'\u00eatre d'abord pench\u00e9 sur la r\u00e9clamation des frais juridiques engag\u00e9s dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, j'estime qu'il convient d'ordonner que certaines de ces d\u00e9penses soient pay\u00e9es. J'estime que l'acte discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9e a entra\u00een\u00e9 Mme Bignell-Malcolm \u00e0 retenir les services d'un avocat. Sans cet acte discriminatoire, Mme Bignell-Malcolm n'aurait pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte et n'aurait vraisemblablement pas retenu les services d'un avocat. Cependant, je crois que le fait que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ait \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience est un fait important. L'avocat de la Commission ne repr\u00e9sente pas le plaignant, il repr\u00e9sente l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Il \u00e9tait parfaitement raisonnable pour Mme Bignell-Malcolm d'engager un avocat pour d\u00e9fendre ses int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[80] Cependant, l'avocat de la Commission a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le actif dans l'interrogation des t\u00e9moins et dans la plaidoirie finale. L'avocat de la plaignante a grandement aid\u00e9 le Tribunal, mais il a partag\u00e9 une bonne part du travail lors de l'audience avec l'avocat de la Commission. Dans ces circonstances, j'estime que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e0 payer la totalit\u00e9 des frais juridiques de la plaignante. J'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer les frais juridiques raisonnablement engag\u00e9s par Mme Bignell-Malcolm dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, dans la mesure o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9e ne paiera que la moiti\u00e9 des frais juridiques engag\u00e9s par la plaignante du 22 octobre 2007 au 26 octobre 2007, soit les dates de l'audience.\n[81] Pour ce qui est des frais juridiques engag\u00e9s par la plaignante dans le cadre de sa poursuite pour cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9 introduite auparavant et dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question plus t\u00f4t, je d\u00e9cide d'exercer mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour ne pas ordonner le paiement de ces d\u00e9penses. Il semble que les d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es dans le cadre de la poursuite pour cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dans une certaine mesure entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire : si l'intim\u00e9e n'avait pas annul\u00e9 son offre d'emploi, Mme Bignell-Malcolm n'aurait pas intent\u00e9 de poursuite. Cependant, la raison pour laquelle la plaignante a commenc\u00e9 par une poursuite au civil plut\u00f4t que par une plainte relative aux droits de la personne n'\u00e9tait pas l'acte discriminatoire en soi, mais l'omission par l'intim\u00e9e d'avouer franchement les motifs de sa d\u00e9cision. Bien qu'il y ait un certain lien de cause \u00e0 effet entre l'acte discriminatoire et les frais juridiques, je refuse d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'indemniser la plaignante pour ces frais juridiques.\ne) Autres d\u00e9penses\n[82] La plaignante r\u00e9clame une indemnisation pour le loyer qu'elle a d\u00fb payer pendant qu'elle travaillait \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de sa collectivit\u00e9. Elle r\u00e9clame 1 218,91 $ de loyer pour les trois mois et demi pendant lesquels elle a travaill\u00e9 pour l'autorit\u00e9 scolaire de Sapotewak, 2 200 $ de loyer pour les quatre mois pendant lesquels elle a travaill\u00e9 pour l'autorit\u00e9 scolaire de Sioux Valley, et 1 500 $ de loyer pour les six mois pendant lesquels elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Winnipeg. Ces montants sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9s pour les frais de subsistance engag\u00e9s pendant la p\u00e9riode pour laquelle j'ai ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer le salaire perdu. Le revenu touch\u00e9 par la plaignante pour ces emplois \u00e9tant d\u00e9duit de sa r\u00e9clamation pour perte de salaire, il est raisonnable que les co\u00fbts engag\u00e9s pour obtenir ce revenu soit rembours\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e et c'est ce que je lui ordonne de faire. Cependant, je n'ordonne pas \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de rembourser \u00e0 la plaignante sa facture d'h\u00f4tel du 4 janvier 2004, ses frais de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire, le co\u00fbt de son abonnement \u00e0 un centre de culture physique, ses meubles (qu'elle poss\u00e8de toujours) ou les frais d'installation et de service du c\u00e2ble.\nf) Int\u00e9r\u00eats\n[83] Les int\u00e9r\u00eats s'appliquent \u00e0 tous les montants accord\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Aux termes du paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, les int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d'escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). Pour ce qui est de l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral et de l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, les int\u00e9r\u00eats commencent \u00e0 courir \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Pour ce qui est de l'indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire, les int\u00e9r\u00eats commencent \u00e0 courir le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2006. Pour les frais juridiques, les int\u00e9r\u00eats commencent \u00e0 courir le 26 octobre 2007, soit le dernier jour d'audience. Pour ce qui est des autres d\u00e9penses, les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont payables \u00e0 partir de la date o\u00f9 la d\u00e9pense a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e.\nf) R\u00e9tention de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal\n[84] Le Tribunal demeure saisi de l'affaire pour recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, entendre des observations additionnelles et rendre d'autres ordonnances si les parties sont incapables d'en venir \u00e0 une entente \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toute question relative aux r\u00e9parations accord\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Si les parties ont besoin de directives se rapportant \u00e0 toute question concernant les r\u00e9parations, ils peuvent en demander au plus tard 60 jours apr\u00e8s la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nJulie C.

Hadjis\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur les documents expurg\u00e9s dont il est question dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Lemire, 2008 TCDP 16, que j'ai rendue ant\u00e9rieurement. J'ai depuis pris connaissance des versions expurg\u00e9e et non expurg\u00e9e de ces documents, et j'ai donn\u00e9 aux parties un aper\u00e7u g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du contenu des parties expurg\u00e9es.\n[2] La Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 statuer sur des questions touchant la communication de certains renseignements, et ce, avant le 29 mai 2008 en ce qui concerne les questions soulev\u00e9es par le Tribunal dans sa d\u00e9cision, et avant le 2 juin 2008 en ce qui concerne les questions soulev\u00e9es par les autres parties. Seuls la Commission et l'intim\u00e9 ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations.\n[3] La Commission soutient qu'elle n'est tenue de communiquer que les renseignements jug\u00e9s potentiellement pertinents, et ajoute que les renseignements personnels ne sont pas potentiellement pertinents et que, en fait, il se peut que la communication des renseignements en question soit interdite par la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P-21. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que les documents ne contiennent aucun renseignement personnel, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui a trait aux noms et aux adresses de policiers en service. Il affirme que les policiers sont pleinement conscients du fait que les documents \u00e9tablis dans le cadre de leur travail peuvent \u00eatre produits devant les tribunaux et examin\u00e9s.\n[4] En l'esp\u00e8ce, j'estime que toute la question de la protection des renseignements personnels n'est qu'un faux d\u00e9bat. Afin de d\u00e9cider quels renseignements peuvent \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s en vertu des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, le premier crit\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9valuer est leur pertinence relativement \u00e0 une question en litige, \u00e0 une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e ou \u00e0 un fait soulev\u00e9 par les parties, c'est-\u00e0-dire leur pertinence potentielle dans l'affaire. Abstraction faite des motivations secondaires pouvant pousser une partie \u00e0 vouloir emp\u00eacher la communication d'un renseignement, si celui-ci n'est pas potentiellement pertinent, il n'a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9, et par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour en ordonner la communication.\n[5] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 laiss\u00e9 entendre au paragraphe 4 de la d\u00e9cision que j'ai rendue ant\u00e9rieurement, afin de d\u00e9cider si les renseignements en cause sont potentiellement pertinents, on doit se demander dans quelle mesure les noms, adresses \u00e9lectroniques, num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, poids et tailles, etc. des personnes dont il est question dans ces documents sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du crit\u00e8re de proportionnalit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103, sur lequel le Tribunal s'\u00e9tait au d\u00e9part fond\u00e9 pour rendre l'ordonnance de communication.\n[6] Les observations de l'intim\u00e9 n'apportent aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question, et ne sont par cons\u00e9quent pas convaincantes en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[7] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de l'intim\u00e9 voulant que la Commission lui communique les parties expurg\u00e9es des documents en cause est rejet\u00e9e.\n[8] En passant, je ferais remarquer que bien que l'intim\u00e9 ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une renonciation \u00e9crite d'Alexan Kulbashian, par laquelle ce dernier autorisait la Commission \u00e0 communiquer les parties non expurg\u00e9es de tous les documents contenant ses renseignements personnels, il n'en reste pas moins qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ces informations \u00e9taient potentiellement pertinentes eu \u00e9gard aux questions en litige. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n'ordonnera pas la communication des renseignements en cause.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n2008 TCDP 31\n2008\/07\/14\n[1] Il s'agit d'une ordonnance au sujet d'une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignantes, Cathy Murphy et l'Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (AFPC). La plainte porte sur des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles l'intim\u00e9e maintient une politique discriminatoire selon laquelle elle applique des int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s \u00e0 des taux sup\u00e9rieurs sur les arri\u00e9r\u00e9s d'imp\u00f4t th\u00e9orique sur le revenu re\u00e7u \u00e0 la suite d'une ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal dans le cadre d'une cause en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale. Pr\u00e8s de 250 000 personnes ont re\u00e7u des paiements \u00e0 la suite d'une ordonnance rendue le 29 octobre 1999 par le Tribunal.\n[2] La requ\u00eate vise l'obtention d'une ordonnance de disjonction de l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce de sorte que la partie de l'instruction concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre entendue et tranch\u00e9e en premier; la partie concernant la r\u00e9paration pourrait \u00eatre entendue lors d'une autre audience, s'il y a lieu. Le motif principal de la demande est que, si la plainte est fond\u00e9e, il faudra obtenir des preuves aupr\u00e8s de milliers de personnes afin de calculer le montant pr\u00e9cis d\u00fb aux 250 000 personnes (approximation) concern\u00e9es par la plainte. Selon les plaignantes, cela prendra \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de temps et retarderait ind\u00fbment l'audience sur la question de la responsabilit\u00e9.\n[3] La Commission appuie la demande des plaignantes de disjoindre l'audience.\n[4] L'intim\u00e9e s'oppose \u00e0 cette demande en estimant que cela n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire. Selon elle, les principes qui r\u00e9gissent la r\u00e9paration peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis au cours de l'audience sans avoir besoin de calculer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats individuels de chaque r\u00e9cipiendaire en cause. Le Tribunal peut traiter la question de la r\u00e9paration en fournissant le cadre n\u00e9cessaire pour calculer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats de chaque personne. L'intim\u00e9e est d'avis que le Tribunal pourrait demeurer saisi de la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats individuels afin de permettre aux parties de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau devant le Tribunal, s'il y a lieu.\n[5] Les plaignantes ont propos\u00e9 une autre solution \u00e0 la disjonction de l'audience : au lieu d'attendre et de traiter la question de la r\u00e9paration dans le cadre d'une deuxi\u00e8me audience, les parties devraient se pencher sur cette question lors de la partie principale de l'audience; les calculs individuels pourraient \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s plus tard, au besoin.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9e accepte cette deuxi\u00e8me demande. Cependant, elle affirme que Mme Murphy devrait \u00eatre oblig\u00e9e de justifier les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'elle a demand\u00e9 au cours de l'audience principale plut\u00f4t que de reprendre cette question dans le cadre d'une autre audience.\n[7] \u00c0 mon avis, la deuxi\u00e8me demande des plaignantes ne n\u00e9cessite pas, et ne devrait pas n\u00e9cessiter, la disjonction de l'audience. Les observations des plaignantes relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate r\u00e9v\u00e8lent clairement que, m\u00eame si le montant pr\u00e9cis des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats de chaque personne vis\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision variait, la formule ou le calcul utilis\u00e9 pour arriver au montant serait v\u00e9rifiable et s'appliquerait aux 250 000 personnes (approximation).\n[8] Par cons\u00e9quent, l'intim\u00e9e a raison de dire que, si des preuves sont soumises au sujet de la m\u00e9thode de calcul des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats individuels, le Tribunal pourrait se prononcer sur cette question et laisser les parties faire leurs propres calculs. De cette fa\u00e7on, la responsabilit\u00e9 et la r\u00e9paration seraient trait\u00e9es dans le cadre de la m\u00eame audience et le Tribunal demeurerait saisi de la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats individuels au cas o\u00f9 il serait n\u00e9cessaire de rendre une nouvelle d\u00e9cision. La cause de Mme Murphy pourrait constituer un exemple utile quant au calcul des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats individuels.\n[9] L'avocat des plaignantes fait remarquer que, bien qu'il ne puisse pas concevoir de r\u00e9paration pour le moment qui n\u00e9cessiterait une appr\u00e9ciation distincte et individuelle, il se r\u00e9serve le droit, dans le cas o\u00f9 il penserait \u00e0 une telle r\u00e9paration, de demander que cet aspect de la r\u00e9paration soit disjoint \u00e9galement. Je ne crois pas tout \u00e0 fait saisir le sens de ces propos. Cependant, en me fondant sur la documentation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 ce jour, je r\u00e9p\u00e8te que je ne vois pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de disjoindre l'audience. J'estime que la tenue d'une seule audience est le moyen le plus rapide et juste de r\u00e9gler la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n\"Sign\u00e9 par\"\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] Il s'agit d'une ordonnance au sujet du processus \u00e0 suivre pour terminer l'instruction de la plainte de Micheline Anne Montreuil contre les Forces canadiennes (FC).\n[2] Mme Montreuil se consid\u00e8re comme une personne transgenre. Elle est n\u00e9e de sexe masculin et s'est appel\u00e9e Pierre Montreuil jusqu'au milieu ou \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 90, lorsqu'elle a entam\u00e9 le processus pour devenir une femme. Elle n'a pas termin\u00e9 ce processus.\n[3] D'avril 1997 \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 1999, la plaignante a servi dans les FC comme membre masculin de la Premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve du R\u00e9giment des Voltigeurs de Qu\u00e9bec. En 1999, on a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante une lib\u00e9ration volontaire des FC. La m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, la plaignante a postul\u00e9, comme femme, pour un r\u00e9enr\u00f4lement dans les Forces canadiennes. Sa demande de r\u00e9enr\u00f4lement et d'emploi au sein des FC a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en 2002.\n[4] Mme Montreuil a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne le 23 octobre 2002 dans laquelle elle soutenait que sa demande de r\u00e9enr\u00f4lement et d'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en raison de son sexe ou d'une invalidit\u00e9 per\u00e7ue. Les FC ont r\u00e9pondu que Mme Montreuil ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences m\u00e9dicales du r\u00e9enr\u00f4lement et qu'elle n'avait pas \u00e9tabli que les circonstances avaient chang\u00e9 depuis sa lib\u00e9ration en 1999 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 justifier son r\u00e9enr\u00f4lement dans les FC.\n[5] Le membre du Tribunal, Pierre Deschamps, a commenc\u00e9 l'audience \u00e0 ce sujet le 23 octobre 2006. L'audience s'est termin\u00e9e le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2007. Le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2008, le statut de M. Deschamps \u00e0 titre de membre du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, attribu\u00e9 par d\u00e9cret, a pris fin. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renomm\u00e9 et le paragraphe 48.2(2) de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne (la Loi) n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en application par le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal pour permettre \u00e0 M. Deschamps de terminer l'instruction de l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[6] Le pr\u00e9sident a attribu\u00e9 l'affaire au vice-pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal pour qu'il g\u00e8re l'instance. Le 13 mai 2008, le vice-pr\u00e9sident a invit\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 examiner la possibilit\u00e9 de tenir une conf\u00e9rence de r\u00e8glement \u00e0 l'amiable pour discuter des options de r\u00e8glement du diff\u00e9rend. L'intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 l'invitation. Le vice-pr\u00e9sident a alors demand\u00e9 aux parties de pr\u00e9senter des observations au sujet de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour conclure l'instruction.\n[7] La plaignante et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) proposent que l'affaire soit instruite par un autre membre, qui se fonderait sur l'examen des transcriptions, de la preuve documentaire et des enregistrements vocaux des t\u00e9moignages. Si n\u00e9cessaire, certains des t\u00e9moins pourraient \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 nouveau pour t\u00e9moigner, si le membre estime que c'est indiqu\u00e9.\n[8] En revanche, l'intim\u00e9e est d'avis que les principes de justice naturelle, et particuli\u00e8rement la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher, exigent que l'affaire soit instruite au complet de novo. L'intim\u00e9e n'accepte pas que le nouveau membre instruise la plainte en se fondant sur la preuve documentaire, les transcriptions et les enregistrements vocaux de l'audience qui s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e devant le membre Deschamps.\n[9] Le principe selon lequel il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher exige que toute personne qui participe \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision doit avoir entendu les t\u00e9moignages et les observations des parties de la fa\u00e7on dont la loi le pr\u00e9voit (Doyle c. Canada (Commission sur les pratiques restrictives du commerce), 1 C.F. 362 (C.A.F.). Ce principe est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important de la r\u00e8gle audi alteram partem de la justice naturelle (au sujet de l'obligation d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 du tribunal) et personne ne s'oppose \u00e0 son application en l'esp\u00e8ce (Syndicat international des travailleurs du bois d'Am\u00e9rique, section locale 2-69 c. Consolidated-Bathurst Packaging Ltd., [1990] 1 R.C.S. 282).\n[10] Le principe selon lequel il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher exige-t-il la tenue d'une nouvelle audience, ou l'affaire peut-elle \u00eatre r\u00e9entendue en fonction du dossier ant\u00e9rieur? Tant les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents judiciaires que les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux administratifs penchent en faveur d'une instruction de novo lorsqu'une ou plus d'une partie n'accepte pas que la nouvelle audition se fasse en fonction du dossier de l'audience ant\u00e9rieure.\n[11] Par exemple, dans Beauregard c. Qu\u00e9bec (Commission de la fonction publique), 1987 CanLII 786 (Q.C. C.A.), la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec a conclu qu'il y avait eu manquement \u00e0 la justice naturelle parce que la Commission de la fonction publique avait nomm\u00e9 un nouveau commissaire pour entendre une plainte de cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9, alors que l'instruction \u00e9tait \u00e0 mi-chemin, m\u00eame si la transcription des t\u00e9moignages avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie au nouveau commissaire.\n[12] Dans Moyer c. Nouveau-Brunswick (Commission de la sant\u00e9, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de l'indemnisation des accidents du travail), 2008 CANB 41, la Cour d'appel du Nouveau-Brunswick a examin\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal d'appel du Nouveau-Brunswick. Le Tribunal d'appel avait entendu les observations au sujet de la r\u00e9ception de nouvelles preuves, puis il avait ajourn\u00e9 l'audience. Lorsque l'instruction a repris, deux des membres du tribunal original avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9s par deux nouveaux membres. La Cour d'appel a conclu que le fait qu'un nouveau tribunal rende une d\u00e9cision sur la plainte de M. Moyer, sans l'avoir avis\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable du changement dans la composition du tribunal, constituait un manquement \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et elle lui a donn\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de recommencer l'audience au complet.\n[13] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision d'un tribunal de la Commission nationale des lib\u00e9rations conditionnelles compos\u00e9 de sept membres dans O'Brien c. Canada (Commission nationale des lib\u00e9rations conditionnelles), [1984] 2 C.F. 314, parce que quatre des membres du tribunal n'\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9sents lors de l'entrevue. Les quatre membres avaient fond\u00e9 leur d\u00e9cision exclusivement sur le dossier \u00e9crit. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu'il s'agissait d'un manquement \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher.\n[14] Les tribunaux des droits de la personne ont appliqu\u00e9 cette jurisprudence pour d\u00e9cider s'ils avaient l'obligation de r\u00e9entendre une affaire de novo lorsqu'une partie refuse que l'affaire soit instruite sur la base du dossier ant\u00e9rieur. Par exemple, dans Salvadori c. British Columbia (Ministry of Health), [1996] B.C.C.H.R.D. no 33 (Q.L.), le Council of Human Rights de la Colombie-Britannique a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'instruction de la plainte d'un certain nombre de m\u00e9decins devait recommencer lorsqu'un membre qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent depuis le d\u00e9but de l'instruction s'est trouv\u00e9 incapable de continuer. Les t\u00e9moignages avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s et des transcriptions de l'audience \u00e9taient disponibles. Cependant, les parties n'\u00e9taient pas toutes pr\u00eates \u00e0 poursuivre en se fondant sur les transcriptions. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 attentivement toutes les observations et toute la jurisprudence, le membre Patch a conclu que le fait de poursuivre l'instruction en se fondant sur les transcriptions des t\u00e9moignages, sans le consentement de toutes les parties, constituerait un manquement aux r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle.\n[15] Dans Davis c. City of Toronto, 2008 HRTO 15, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le principe d'audi alteram partem exigeait la tenue d'une nouvelle instruction lorsque le membre ayant commenc\u00e9 l'instruction \u00e9tait incapable de la terminer. Les notes de l'avocat de la Commission et du membre qui avait instruit la premi\u00e8re partie de l'affaire constituaient le seul dossier \u00e9crit de la proc\u00e9dure. Les parties n'ont pas convenu que la nouvelle membre pouvait utiliser les notes au lieu d'instruire l'affaire de novo.\n[16] La nouvelle membre a mentionn\u00e9 que l'affaire soulevait des questions graves au sujet du droit du plaignant d'\u00eatre embauch\u00e9 comme pompier par la ville. L'affaire portait sur l'application de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, dont la nature quasi constitutionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue. Les faits portant sur le processus d'embauche, ainsi que l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant, \u00e9taient contest\u00e9s et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e9tait en question. La nouvelle membre a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce type d'affaire faisait toujours l'objet d'une audience orale devant le Tribunal, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin par la m\u00eame formation du tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle a conclu qu'il ne serait pas appropri\u00e9 de se fonder sur les notes manuscrites pour constituer un dossier officiel de l'instance. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas convaincue que la reprise de l'audience, \u00e0 mi-chemin dans les t\u00e9moignages, respecterait les principes de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[17] Je suis d'avis que les affaires Davis et Salvadori sont r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices. Comme pour les tribunaux de l'Ontario et de la Colombie-Britannique, le Tribunal a le mandat, pr\u00e9vu par la loi, de rendre une d\u00e9cision finale dans les plaintes portant sur des droits quasi constitutionnels. Les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal, ainsi que son processus de prise de d\u00e9cision, sont de nature semblable \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire.\n[18] La Commission et la plaignante soutiennent que, compte tenu de la ressemblance entre le processus de prise de d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et celui d'une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire, le Tribunal peut adopter l'approche utilis\u00e9e par les cours et les autres tribunaux d'instances quasi judiciaires lorsqu'ils se trouvent dans des situations semblables \u00e0 celle en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[19] Par exemple, les R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales permettent au juge en chef de remplacer un juge dans une affaire et d'ordonner une nouvelle audience ou instruction, selon les modalit\u00e9s qu'il estime \u00e9quitables (article 39 des R\u00e8gles des cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales). Cependant, il semble qu'\u00e0 ce jour, aucune jurisprudence n'existe dans laquelle cette r\u00e8gle a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e.\n[20] De plus, les R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ne contiennent pas de disposition l\u00e9gislative claire pour indiquer que le Tribunal, par opposition \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, a le pouvoir d'abroger les r\u00e8gles d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Dans un m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, les Rules of Court de la Colombie-Britannique, sur lesquelles la cour s'est fond\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Garbutt c. Burbank, 2000 BCSC 13, et le Code de proc\u00e9dure civile du Qu\u00e9bec, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Commission de reconnaissance des associations d'artistes et des associations des producteurs (13 janvier 2006, Dossier : 2000-0193 (AD) (non publi\u00e9e)), ne donnent pas au Tribunal le pouvoir d'abroger ou de modifier les r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle ou de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale sans l'accord des parties.\n[21] La Commission a invoqu\u00e9 ces deux d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l'appui de son argument selon lequel le Tribunal pouvait poursuivre l'instruction en se fondant sur les transcriptions, sans que toutes les parties ne donnent leur consentement. Cependant, la jurisprudence est claire : les r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle ne peuvent \u00eatre abrog\u00e9es que par une disposition l\u00e9gislative claire (Kane c. Le conseil d'administration de l'universit\u00e9 de la Colombie-Britannique (1980), 18 B.C.L.R. 124 (CSC), au paragraphe 135). Les r\u00e8gles applicables aux cours relevant d'autres ressorts ne donnent pas au Tribunal une comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative claire pour abroger les r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle.\n[22] Cependant, la question reste de savoir si le Tribunal peut instruire \u00e0 nouveau l'affaire en se fondant sur une partie, ou sur la totalit\u00e9, du dossier ant\u00e9rieur si les parties y consentent. L'intim\u00e9e, citant la d\u00e9cision Doyle, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, soutient que le Tribunal ne peut pas le faire. L'affaire Doyle portait sur le contr\u00f4le judiciaire d'un rapport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par une commission \u00e9tablie en vertu de la Loi sur les corporations canadiennes au sujet d'all\u00e9gations de fraude que M. Doyle aurait commise. M. Doyle n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent aux audiences, mais il \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat pendant une partie de la proc\u00e9dure. L'avocat de M. Doyle s'est absent\u00e9 lors de la derni\u00e8re partie de la proc\u00e9dure afin de protester contre la fa\u00e7on dont la proc\u00e9dure s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9e. M. Doyle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire du rapport dans lequel il \u00e9tait soutenu qu'il y avait eu de nombreux probl\u00e8mes lors de la proc\u00e9dure, entre autres le fait que deux des trois personnes qui avaient sign\u00e9 le rapport n'\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 toutes les audiences. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que ce manquement \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale suffisait \u00e0 annuler le rapport. Il y avait eu violation de la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher.\n[23] La Cour d'appel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher affecte la comp\u00e9tence du d\u00e9cideur. Pour cette raison, la violation de cette r\u00e8gle peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e m\u00eame par un plaideur qui a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 une audience devant la cour qui l'a jug\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, un d\u00e9fendeur qui volontairement ne se pr\u00e9sente pas \u00e0 l'audience renonce au droit d'\u00eatre entendu. Cependant, il ne renonce pas au droit d'\u00eatre jug\u00e9 par un d\u00e9cideur qui a entendu la preuve.\n[24] Dans le texte Practice and Procedure Before Administrative Tribunals (pratique et proc\u00e9dure devant les tribunaux administratifs), les auteurs Robert Macaulay et James Sprague sont d'avis que la d\u00e9cision Doyle ne d\u00e9fend pas l'id\u00e9e que les principes de justice naturelle ne permettent pas \u00e0 une partie de renoncer, par choix volontaire et inform\u00e9, \u00e0 une audience compl\u00e8te de l'affaire. En fait, la d\u00e9cision propose plut\u00f4t que le fait de renoncer au droit \u00e0 une audience ne constitue pas un renoncement \u00e0 l'obligation du d\u00e9cideur d'avoir lui-m\u00eame examin\u00e9 la preuve et les observations qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, m\u00eame si une partie a choisi de ne pas pr\u00e9senter de preuve ou d'observation elle-m\u00eame (aux pages 22-22 \u00e0 22-24). La d\u00e9cision fait aussi valoir que le renoncement \u00e0 certains aspects de la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher doit \u00eatre explicite.\n[25] Macaulay et Sprague soutiennent que, comme pour d'autres aspects du principe audi alteram partem, tels que la partialit\u00e9, il devrait \u00eatre possible de renoncer \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher. Ils expliquent :\n[traduction]\nLe franc-jeu est fonction des circonstances dans lesquelles il se trouve, et un manquement \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher peut difficilement \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une injustice envers une partie qui a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son application. Je ne vois aucune objection socio-politique au fait qu'un demandeur choisisse volontairement et sciemment qu'un d\u00e9cideur tranche sa demande sans avoir personnellement entendu la preuve. Par exemple, une personne pourrait accepter qu'un d\u00e9cideur examine les transcriptions des proc\u00e9dures ant\u00e9rieures. Ce choix peut \u00eatre louable lorsque les d\u00e9lais et les d\u00e9penses inh\u00e9rentes aux nouvelles auditions de plaintes peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9s, dans les instances o\u00f9 une nouvelle audience n'a pas d'objectif pratique. (Sprague et Macaulay, \u00e0 la page 22-23) (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.)\n[26] Je souscris \u00e0 cette explication. \u00c0 mon avis, rien n'emp\u00eache les parties de s'entendre pour que certaines parties de la transcription soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve. En effet, l'alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements par d\u00e9claration verbale ou \u00e9crite sous serment ou par tout autre moyen qu'il estime indiqu\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire.\n[27] Dans les d\u00e9cisions Davis et Salvadori, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario et le Council of Human Rights de la Colombie-Britannique ont soulign\u00e9 que leur d\u00e9cision ordonnant la tenue d'une audience de novo ne signifie pas qu'il faut un t\u00e9moignage oral pour chaque aspect de l'affaire si les parties ont convenu d'autres modalit\u00e9s. Les membres ont encourag\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 conclure une entente sur la fa\u00e7on dont la preuve serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au tribunal. Dans l'affaire Davis, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, parmi les choix qui s'ouvraient \u00e0 elles, les parties pouvaient utiliser les notes du membre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent comme fondement pour produire une preuve ou un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des faits conjoints, ou comme fondement pour pr\u00e9senter des affidavits \u00e0 titre de preuve principale. Dans les deux cas, les parties devaient pr\u00e9senter des preuves et effectuer des contre-interrogatoires sur les points sur lesquels elles ne s'\u00e9taient pas entendues. Dans l'affaire Salvadori, le membre Patch a propos\u00e9 que les documents et les t\u00e9moignages non litigieux de l'audience ant\u00e9rieure soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le dossier \u00e9crit de cette audience.\n[28] En l'esp\u00e8ce, il est \u00e9videmment dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de toutes les parties que l'affaire soit r\u00e9solue rapidement et de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable. L'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce a dur\u00e9 97 jours. Il ne fait aucun doute, \u00e0 mon avis, que l'affaire peut \u00eatre instruite de nouveau en un temps beaucoup plus court. Une grande partie des t\u00e9moignages et des documents n'est pas en litige. Il est m\u00eame possible que les parties arrivent \u00e0 s'entendre pour que l'interrogatoire principal des t\u00e9moins non experts soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des transcriptions et que le contre-interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins ait ensuite lieu verbalement. Les parties doivent toutes faire un effort de bonne foi pour arriver \u00e0 une entente au sujet de la preuve documentaire et des t\u00e9moignages qui ne sont pas contest\u00e9s et qui n'ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que lors de l'audience ant\u00e9rieure.\n[29] Le gestionnaire d'instance rencontrera les parties afin d'essayer d'en venir \u00e0 une entente quant aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience ant\u00e9rieure qui pourraient \u00eatre produits \u00e0 la nouvelle audience sans n\u00e9cessiter de t\u00e9moignages de vive voix.\nSign\u00e9e par\nKaren A.

INTRODUCTION [1] En guise d'introduction, il serait bon de revoir l'objet de la Loi, ainsi que le r\u00f4le du Tribunal.\n[2] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6 (version modifi\u00e9e) (la Loi) vise \u00e0 favoriser l'essor des droits individuels d'importance vitale. Compte tenu des termes puissants de son article 2, l'objet de la Loi est \u00e9vident. Pour que tous puissent avoir des chances \u00e9gales d' \u00e9panouissement, la Loi cherche \u00e0 interdire les consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de la famille, la d\u00e9ficience, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e et le sexe, qui priveraient un individu des opportunit\u00e9s d'emploi. C'est l'acte discriminatoire lui-m\u00eame que la Loi vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir. Elle n'a pas pour objet de punir la faute, mais bien de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination. (Voir : Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, au paras. 24 et 25.)\n[3] L'objet de la Loi n'est donc pas d'attribuer \u00e0 quelqu'un une responsabilit\u00e9 morale ou de punir. Il ne peut y avoir de doute que la l\u00e9gislation canadienne est normalement r\u00e9dig\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9viter toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'intention, mis \u00e0 part \u00e9videmment le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi o\u00f9 le l\u00e9gislateur a pr\u00e9vu que l'intention pouvait avoir un impact sur l'indemnit\u00e9 que l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire peut \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 de payer \u00e0 la victime.\n[4] Dans l'arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la p. 547, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s'est exprim\u00e9e clairement sur l'objet d'une telle Loi, jugeant que sa port\u00e9e va plus loin que la discrimination volontaire :\nC'est le r\u00e9sultat ou l'effet de la mesure dont on se plaint qui importe. Si elle cr\u00e9e effectivement de la discrimination, si elle a pour effet d'imposer \u00e0 une personne ou \u00e0 un groupe de personnes des obligations, des peines ou des conditions restrictives non impos\u00e9es aux autres membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, elle est discriminatoire.\n[5] L'importance d'une loi portant sur les droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue dans l'arr\u00eat Insurance Corporation of British Columbia c. Heerspink, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 145. Le juge Lamer, tel \u00e9tait alors son titre, souligne, \u00e0 la page 158, qu'une telle loi ne doit pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme n'importe quelle autre loi d'application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il faut [la] reconna\u00eetre pour ce qu' [elle] est, c'est-\u00e0-dire une loi fondamentale. Ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 davantage par le juge McIntyre, au nom d'une Cour supr\u00eame unanime, dans l'arr\u00eat Winnipeg School Division No. 1 c. Craton, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 150, \u00e0 la p. 156 :\nUne loi sur les droits de la personne est de nature sp\u00e9ciale et \u00e9nonce une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale applicable \u00e0 des questions d'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Elle n'est pas de nature constitutionnelle, en ce sens qu'elle ne peut pas \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e, r\u00e9vis\u00e9e ou abrog\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislature. Elle est cependant d'une nature telle que seule une d\u00e9claration l\u00e9gislative claire peut permettre de la modifier, de la r\u00e9viser ou de l'abroger, ou encore de cr\u00e9er des exceptions \u00e0 ses dispositions.\n[6] La jurisprudence a donc reconnu \u00e0 la Loi un caract\u00e8re fondamental et quasi-constitutionnel, ce qui lui assure une supr\u00e9matie de principe par rapport aux lois ordinaires. (Voir \u00e9galement : Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mossop, [1993] 1 R.C.S. 554.)\n[7] La l\u00e9gislation canadienne en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne envisage essentiellement la protection contre la discrimination. Dans le domaine de l'emploi, son objet plus particulier est de mettre fin \u00e0 une exclusion arbitraire bas\u00e9e sur des id\u00e9es pr\u00e9con\u00e7ues \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles qui, tout en tenant compte du devoir d'accommodement, n'affectent aucunement la capacit\u00e9 d'un individu de faire le travail.\n[8] Dans l'extrait suivant du Rapport de la Commission sur l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi (1984) (aussi appel\u00e9 \"Rapport Abella\"), \u00e0 la p. 2, (extrait reproduit dans Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville); Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Boisbriand (Ville), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665, au par. 37) la commission s'exprime \u00e9loquemment \u00e0 ce sujet :\nL'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi signifie que nul ne doit se voir refuser un d\u00e9bouch\u00e9 pour des raisons qui n'ont rien \u00e0 voir avec sa comp\u00e9tence. Elle signifie le libre acc\u00e8s sans barri\u00e8res arbitraires. La discrimination fait qu'un obstacle arbitraire vient souvent s'interposer entre la comp\u00e9tence d'une personne et sa possibilit\u00e9 d'en faire la preuve. Si quiconque d\u00e9sirant se r\u00e9aliser a v\u00e9ritablement la possibilit\u00e9 d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'emploi qui l'int\u00e9resse, on atteint alors une certaine \u00e9galit\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire le droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 sans aucune discrimination.\nDans ce contexte, la discrimination s'entend des pratiques ou des attitudes qui, de par leur conception ou par voie de cons\u00e9quence, g\u00eanent l'acc\u00e8s des particuliers ou des groupes \u00e0 des possibilit\u00e9s d'emplois, en raison de caract\u00e9ristiques qui leur sont pr\u00eat\u00e9es \u00e0 tort. L'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 n'est pas limit\u00e9 par ses capacit\u00e9s, mais par des barri\u00e8res artificielles qui l'emp\u00eachent de mettre \u00e0 profit son potentiel.\n[9] Dans ce contexte l\u00e9gislatif, la principale fonction du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne est de nature juridictionnelle. Il tient des audiences formelles sur les plaintes dont il est saisi par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission). Il d\u00e9tient plusieurs des pouvoirs d'une cour de justice. Il est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 statuer sur des faits, \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter et \u00e0 appliquer le droit aux faits qui lui sont soumis et \u00e0 accorder les redressements appropri\u00e9s. De plus, ses audiences sont structur\u00e9es sensiblement de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'un proc\u00e8s formel devant une cour de justice. Les parties en pr\u00e9sence devant le tribunal pr\u00e9sentent une preuve, font entendre et contre-interrogent des t\u00e9moins, et pr\u00e9sentent des observations sur l'application du droit aux faits. Le Tribunal ne m\u00e8ne pas ses propres enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendantes sur les plaintes : le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission les fonctions d'enqu\u00eater sur les plaintes.\n[10] L'audience devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a pour objectif de permettre au Tribunal d'entendre les preuves et les arguments pertinents afin de pouvoir d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu discrimination. \u00c0 l'audience, le plaignant ou la plaignante a l'occasion d'expliquer, par sa preuve, en quoi il ou elle a fait l'objet d'une discrimination et quel redressement il ou elle cherche \u00e0 obtenir. L'intim\u00e9 pour sa part aura l'occasion de r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations du plaignant et de contrer, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les demandes de redressement.\n[11] Ce n'est pas le r\u00f4le du Tribunal de pr\u00e9sumer des faits qui auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, de tirer des conclusions d'hypoth\u00e8ses non fond\u00e9es ou de refaire le travail des avocats. Le Tribunal prend le dossier tel qu'il est et rend la d\u00e9cision la plus \u00e9quitable \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits et arguments qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\nA. LE CADRE JURIDIQUE [12] Magaly Germain (la plaignante) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, le 12 septembre 2004, une plainte contre le Groupe Major Express Inc. (l' intim\u00e9). La plaignante all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit de la discrimination en mati\u00e8re d'emploi contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9voit l'article 7 de la Loi. Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en raison de sa grossesse en refusant de la reprendre \u00e0 son emploi \u00e0 la suite de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9, pour sa part, soutient qu'il n'a jamais refus\u00e9 de reprendre la plaignante et que c'est plut\u00f4t elle qui a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi en acceptant un poste ailleurs.\n[13] Depuis les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour supr\u00eame dans les arr\u00eats Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 [ appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement Meiorin ] et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 [ appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement Grismer ], la distinction classique entre la discrimination directe et la discrimination indirecte fait place \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode unifi\u00e9e d'analyse des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. Selon cette m\u00e9thode, il incombe d'abord \u00e0 la partie plaignante d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[14] La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. Les all\u00e9gations faites par la partie plaignante doivent \u00eatre dignes de foi afin de justifier la conclusion qu'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. (Voir : Singh c. Statistique Canada, [1998] T.C.D.P. no 7, confirm\u00e9e [2000] A.C.F. no 417 (C.F., 1re inst.), et Dhanjal c. Air Canada, [1997] A.C.F. no 1599, (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37.) Le d\u00e9cideur n'a pas \u00e0 tenir compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9 lorsqu'il d\u00e9termine si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie. (O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985], 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28; voir aussi Dhanjal c. Air Canada, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 6, et Moore c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes, 2007 TCDP 31, au paragraphe 85).\n[15] Une fois une preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie, le fardeau se d\u00e9place sur l'intim\u00e9e, qui doit alors fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e.\n[16] La norme de la preuve dans les causes de discrimination est la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Selon cette norme, l'on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible. (Premakumar c. Air Canada, [2002] D.C.D.P. N\u00b0 3, au par. 81.) Un plaignant n'a pas \u00e0 prouver que la discrimination \u00e9tait le seul facteur qui a influenc\u00e9 le comportement qui fait l'objet de la plainte. Il suffit que le plaignant \u00e9tablisse une preuve prima facie que la discrimination est l'un de ces facteurs. (Voir : Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029.)\nB. LES FAITS [17] L'intim\u00e9 est une entreprise de camionnage interprovinciale et internationale qui op\u00e8re essentiellement au Qu\u00e9bec, en Ontario et vers les \u00c9tats-Unis. Daniel Gaudreau en est le pr\u00e9sident. En 2002, l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers une proposition concordataire en vertu de Loi sur la faillite et l'insolvabilit\u00e9, L.R.C. (1985), ch. B-3. La premi\u00e8re assembl\u00e9e des cr\u00e9anciers a eu lieu le 18 octobre 2002. La proposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par les cr\u00e9anciers et a pris effet le 5 novembre 2003. (La question de l'effet de la proposition concordataire sur la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u00e0 l'objet d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire : Germain c. Groupe Major Express Inc., 2007 T.C.D.P. 57.)\n[18] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 le 1er juillet 2002. Les modalit\u00e9s de l'entente d'emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises par \u00e9crit et sign\u00e9es par les deux parties. Selon cette entente, la plaignante est embauch\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9partitrice dans les op\u00e9rations de la compagnie. L'entente pr\u00e9voit que ses t\u00e2ches consistent \u00e0 assister la direction dans la gestion journali\u00e8re des besoins de transport des clients et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 planifier les besoins des clients et le service de livraison avec les chauffeurs, \u00e0 surveiller les rapports des chauffeurs et \u00e0 subvenir \u00e0 leurs besoins, \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier les d\u00e9penses de routes et tout autre travail exig\u00e9 par la direction et reli\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition.\n[19] Pour ce travail, le contrat d'emploi pr\u00e9voit que la plaignante recevra un salaire hebdomadaire de 770 $, soit l'\u00e9quivalent d'un salaire annuel de 40 040 $. L'entente, r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, ne pr\u00e9voit ni p\u00e9riode de probation, ni p\u00e9riode de formation. Toutefois, en contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante dira qu'\u00e0 partir du 2 juillet, j'\u00e9tais en `training', reconnaissant ainsi qu'il y avait eu une p\u00e9riode de formation au d\u00e9but de son emploi. Lors de son interrogatoire, M. Gaudreau pr\u00e9cisera que d\u00e8s son embauche en juillet il a fallu [que la plaignante] se familiarise avec l'entreprise et avec les chauffeurs. La deuxi\u00e8me semaine, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre le dessus et \u00e0 mieux comprendre l'entreprise et le fonctionnement de notre syst\u00e8me d'informatique LINK. J'en conclus que s'il y a eu une p\u00e9riode de formation, celle-ci n'a pas d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les deux premi\u00e8res semaines d'embauche.\n[20] Vers la fin juillet, d\u00e9but ao\u00fbt 2002, la plaignante apprend qu'elle est enceinte. La date pr\u00e9vue pour l'accouchement est le 23 mars 2003. Elle dit en avoir inform\u00e9 son employeur imm\u00e9diatement, ce que M. Gaudreau ne nie pas.\n[21] Le premier mois de grossesse ne fut pas de tout repos. La plaignante souffre fr\u00e9quemment de naus\u00e9e. Elle dit ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 au meilleur de sa forme physique. Elle pr\u00e9cise avoir d\u00fb s'absenter de son travail \u00e0 quelques reprises au d\u00e9but du mois de septembre 2002. Le 26 septembre 2002, son m\u00e9decin lui donne un certificat m\u00e9dical qui atteste qu'elle sera absente du travail les 26 et 27 septembre pour raisons de sant\u00e9. Toutefois, elle ne reviendra pas au travail apr\u00e8s ces deux jours de cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n[22] Le 25 octobre 2002, son m\u00e9decin \u00e9met un nouveau certificat m\u00e9dical, pla\u00e7ant la plaignante en arr\u00eat de travail du 26 septembre 2002 jusqu'\u00e0 son accouchement. Sur le certificat, le m\u00e9decin indique que l'arr\u00eat de travail est pour raison de sant\u00e9 (stress important et insomnie secondaire \u00e0 son travail). Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante pr\u00e9cisera qu'elle \u00e9tait en retrait pr\u00e9ventif du travail en raison de complications du au fait que le placenta n'\u00e9tait pas en place ce qui pouvait \u00eatre dangereux pour le b\u00e9b\u00e9. Cependant, je constate que le certificat m\u00e9dical ne fait aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la condition m\u00e9dicale telle que d\u00e9crite par la plaignante et aucune preuve ne fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante pour \u00e9tayer cette affirmation. Quoi qu'il en soit, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas contest\u00e9 cette preuve.\n[23] Selon la plaignante, jusqu'\u00e0 son arr\u00eat de travail le 26 septembre 2002, ses relations avec son employeur \u00e9taient bonnes. Pour appuyer cette affirmation, elle pr\u00e9cisera qu'en d\u00e9cembre 2002, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle est invit\u00e9e au brunch de No\u00ebl de l'entreprise. Selon elle, sa date d'accouchement \u00e9tait alors connue de l'intim\u00e9, mais il n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 question de sa date pr\u00e9vue de retour au travail.\n[24] La plaignante a accouch\u00e9 comme pr\u00e9vu au mois de mars 2003. Au mois d'avril, elle se rend chez l'intim\u00e9 afin de pr\u00e9senter son nouveau-n\u00e9 \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de travail. Elle pr\u00e9cise que c'est \u00e0 ce moment qu'elle a laiss\u00e9 une lettre, dat\u00e9e du 14 avril 2003, indiquant le 12 janvier 2004 comme date de son retour au travail. C'est \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce moment qu'elle a rencontr\u00e9 son rempla\u00e7ant, M. Antoine Genest.\n[25] Au mois de juin 2003, la plaignante dit avoir re\u00e7u un appel de M. Gaudreau qui lui demande s'il n'est pas possible qu'elle revienne au travail plus t\u00f4t, car il d\u00e9sirait partir en vacance au mois de juillet. Elle ajoute qu'il lui aurait m\u00eame offert les services de sa belle-sur pour garder le b\u00e9b\u00e9. La plaignante pr\u00e9cise qu'il lui \u00e9tait impossible de revenir au travail \u00e0 ce moment, car son b\u00e9b\u00e9 n'avait que trois mois et qu'en plus elle devait l'allaiter.\n[26] Elle dit avoir eu une autre conversation avec M. Gaudreau au mois d'ao\u00fbt 2003. \u00c0 ce moment, M. Gaudreau voulait savoir quand elle reviendrait au travail. Elle ajoute qu'il insistait pour qu'elle revienne le plus t\u00f4t possible. Elle dit que l'insistance de M. Gaudreau la stressait; qu'elle ne voulait pas perdre son emploi. Elle pr\u00e9cise avoir essay\u00e9, mais sans succ\u00e8s, de trouver une gardienne pour son enfant. Elle dit avoir expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Gaudreau que tant et aussi longtemps qu'elle ne trouvait pas une gardienne fiable, elle s'en tenait \u00e0 la date de retour au travail pr\u00e9vue pour janvier 2004.\n[27] M. Gaudreau \u00e0 une version diff\u00e9rente de ce qui se serait produit apr\u00e8s l'accouchement de la plaignante. Tout en reconnaissant qu'elle \u00e9tait venue leur pr\u00e9senter son nouveau b\u00e9b\u00e9 en avril 2003, il ajoute : Elle nous appelait pour dire qu'elle s'ennuyait de son emploi et elle disait qu'elle avait h\u00e2te de revenir. Elle disait qu'elle reviendrait en juin si elle pouvait trouver une gardienne. Il ajoute qu'au mois d'ao\u00fbt 2003, elle l'aurait appel\u00e9 pour lui dire qu'elle avait su que \u00e7a n'allait pas bien financi\u00e8rement pour l'entreprise. Elle m'a demand\u00e9 si l'entreprise risquait de fermer. Selon M. Gaudreau, ce qui inqui\u00e9tait la plaignante \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque c'\u00e9tait sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi.\n[28] L'intim\u00e9 ajoute n'avoir pris connaissance qu'en septembre 2003 de la lettre du 14 avril 2003, dans laquelle la plaignante mentionne que son retour au travail est pr\u00e9vu pour janvier 2004. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Gaudreau ajoutera qu'il est tr\u00e8s surpris de voir la date d'avril sur cette lettre. C'est faux c'\u00e9tait en septembre que nous l'avons re\u00e7u et qu'elle nous a annonc\u00e9 qu'elle reviendrait pour le 12 janvier 2004. \u00c7a, on est cat\u00e9gorique. J'ai re\u00e7u cette lettre non en avril mais en septembre. Elle disait toujours qu'elle voulait revenir en juin, qu'elle avait h\u00e2te. Lorsque le Tribunal lui a demand\u00e9 s'il avait la copie de la lettre que l'entreprise avait re\u00e7ue avec la date de r\u00e9ception tamponn\u00e9e sur celle-ci, il a r\u00e9pondu que ce n'\u00e9tait pas la pratique de l'intim\u00e9 de tamponner la date de r\u00e9ception sur les lettres qu'il recevait. Il n'a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de produire une preuve pour \u00e9tayer ses accusations voulant que la plaignante ait antidat\u00e9 la lettre.\n[29] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Gaudreau t\u00e9moignera que la plaignante devait revenir au travail pour le mois de juin 2003. Il ajoute qu'en juin, elle aurait communiqu\u00e9 avec lui pour lui demander si elle pouvait revenir au travail en ao\u00fbt ou septembre, car elle n'arrivait pas \u00e0 trouver une gardienne pour son enfant. Finalement, il ajoute qu'en ao\u00fbt, elle aurait \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'employeur pour l'avertir de son retour pour le 12 janvier 2004. Or, cette lettre du mois d'ao\u00fbt, si elle existe, n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 produite en preuve \u00e0 l'audience et aucune explication n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e au Tribunal pour expliquer pourquoi elle n'\u00e9tait pas produite.\n[30] Bien qu'il ait contre-interrog\u00e9 la plaignante sur le contenu de sa lettre du 14 avril 2003, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 n'a jamais mentionn\u00e9 que son t\u00e9moin, M. Gaudreau, allait t\u00e9moigner ne l'avoir jamais re\u00e7ue avant septembre et qu'il allait m\u00eame all\u00e9guer que la date sur la lettre de la plaignante \u00e9tait fausse.\n[31] Quoi qu'il en soit, que l'intim\u00e9 ait re\u00e7u la lettre en avril ou, comme il l'all\u00e8gue, en septembre, il n'a jamais, soit par \u00e9crit, soit oralement, indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante qu'il n'acceptait pas sa date de retour au travail. Du moins, il n'a fourni aucune preuve \u00e0 cet effet.\n[32] M. Gaudreau pr\u00e9cise qu'en septembre 2003, Antoine Genest, le rempla\u00e7ant de la plaignante, \u00e9tant d\u00e9bord\u00e9, il a pris la d\u00e9cision d'embaucher un stagiaire pour lui venir en aide. Il ajoute m\u00eame : On a n\u00e9goci\u00e9 que s'il faisait l'affaire qu'on le garderait si [la plaignante] ne revenait pas.\n[33] Le 17 octobre 2003, la plaignante appelle M. Gaudreau afin de discuter de son \u00e9ventuel retour au travail en janvier 2004. C'est lors de cette conversation que M. Gaudreau lui aurait dit qu'elle n'avait plus sa place au sein de l'\u00e9quipe et qu'il avait embauch\u00e9 M. Genest pour occuper \u00e0 temps plein le poste de r\u00e9partiteur. Selon la plaignante, il aurait ajout\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 lui sugg\u00e9rer d'autres compagnies pour lesquelles elle pourrait travailler.\n[34] Apr\u00e8s cette conversation, la plaignante dit avoir appel\u00e9 les normes du travail du Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 on lui aurait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d'\u00e9crire une lettre \u00e0 son employeur afin de savoir si les liens d'emploi \u00e9taient v\u00e9ritablement rompus.\n[35] Le 22 octobre 2003, la plaignante fait parvenir une lettre \u00e0 M. Gaudreau confirmant leur conversation du 17 octobre. Dans cette lettre, qui se voulait, selon elle, un suivi \u00e0 leur conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, elle indique \u00e0 son employeur qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 surprise d'apprendre [...] qu'il l'avait attendu jusqu'en septembre et que puisqu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas revenue au travail, il avait d\u00fb engager Fran\u00e7ois [le stagiaire] car [il] n'en pouvait plus d'\u00eatre au dispatch. La plaignante ajoute dans sa lettre qu'elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Gaudreau si elle avait encore une place au sein de son entreprise et qu'il lui aurait r\u00e9pondue que son \u00e9quipe de r\u00e9partiteurs \u00e9tait maintenant compl\u00e8te [et] qu'il ne pouvait plus lui garantir un poste. Il aurait ajout\u00e9, selon elle, qu'il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable qu'elle commence \u00e0 se chercher un [nouveau] emploi. La plaignante \u00e9crit qu'elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Gaudreau s'il avait l'intention d'attendre au 10 janvier pour lui annoncer qu'elle n'avait plus d'emploi, ce \u00e0 quoi il aurait r\u00e9pondu, encore une fois selon la lettre, qu'il n'avait plus son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.\n[36] Elle \u00e9crit \u00e9galement dans sa lettre que l'employeur lui a dit que son rempla\u00e7ant gagnait 39 000 $, par ann\u00e9e, ce qui \u00e9tait moins que le salaire qu'il versait \u00e0 la plaignante et que cela justifiait en soi sa d\u00e9cision de ne plus lui garantir son poste. Elle \u00e9crit : Ce que vous oubliez c'est que le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 existe pour permettre \u00e0 la m\u00e8re de consacrer tout son temps et son \u00e9nergie \u00e0 son nouveau-n\u00e9. Par contre, dans la situation pr\u00e9sente, je vais passer les deux derniers mois et demi de mon cong\u00e9 \u00e0 m'inqui\u00e9ter, \u00e0 \u00eatre ins\u00e9cure et probablement \u00e0 me chercher un autre emploi, car durant cette m\u00eame discussion vous m'avez fait ressentir que vous ne pouviez me garantir une qualit\u00e9 de vie au travail \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 celle que j'avais avant mon d\u00e9part.\n[37] Finalement, elle demande \u00e0 son employeur de confirmer par \u00e9crit, avant le 5 novembre 2003, qu'elle pourra retourner \u00e0 son travail en janvier 2004 au m\u00eame poste et au m\u00eame salaire. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre de la plaignante.\n[38] En contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante pr\u00e9cisera avoir envoy\u00e9 cette lettre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 par courrier recommand\u00e9. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Gaudreau dira ne pas se souvenir d'avoir re\u00e7u cette lettre. Demand\u00e9 par l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 de produire une copie du re\u00e7u de la poste confirmant l'envoie, la plaignante lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un document qui a sembl\u00e9 satisfaire l'avocat puisqu'il n'a pas poursuivi sur cette ligne de questions. Lors des observations finales, l'intim\u00e9 n'est pas revenu sur ce point.\n[39] Malheureusement, le re\u00e7u de la poste n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en preuve et le Tribunal n'a donc pas pu en prendre connaissance. Cependant, je suis convaincu que s'il y avait eu un probl\u00e8me avec le document l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 n'aurait pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 le produire et ne l'ayant pas fait, je ne peux que d\u00e9duire qu'il confirme bel et bien l'envoi de la lettre.\n[40] N'ayant pas re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse de l'employeur, la plaignante dit avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se chercher un emploi. Le 3 novembre 2003, elle \u00e9tait embauch\u00e9e par une compagnie du nom de Liti\u00e8re Royale pour laquelle elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 avant son embauche chez l'intim\u00e9. La date de son embauche \u00e0 ce nouvel emploi est quelque peu \u00e9tonnante, consid\u00e9rant que dans sa lettre du 22 octobre, elle avait laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 son employeur jusqu'au 5 novembre pour lui confirmer si oui ou non il la reprendrait \u00e0 son poste en janvier 2004. Elle explique qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se chercher un emploi, car elle savait qu'en janvier il serait difficile de s'en trouver un \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec.\n[41] Selon M. Gaudreau, le 2 novembre, il appelle chez Liti\u00e8re Royale, un client de l'intim\u00e9, et, \u00e0 sa grande surprise, c'est la plaignante qui r\u00e9pond au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Il ajoute : Je lui dit qu'est-ce que tu fais l\u00e0? Si tu voulais revenir au travail pourquoi tu n'es pas revenu avec nous autres? Tout ce qu'elle m'a r\u00e9pondu c'est l'incertitude du Groupe Major Express. Elle ne sait pas si on va rester ouvert ou non. J'ai vu que [la plaignante] n'\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9e avec Groupe Major Express. Un peu plus loin, il ajoutera La discussion ne m'a pas marqu\u00e9e. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 plut\u00f4t surpris qu'elle \u00e9tait l\u00e0. On ne savait pas qu'elle \u00e9tait l\u00e0. Pour nous autres, elle \u00e9tait toujours malade, elle se cherchait une gardienne. Je ne savais absolument rien de ses efforts pour se chercher un emploi ailleurs. On ne l'a jamais cong\u00e9di\u00e9. On a \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris de voir...on voulait avoir une r\u00e9ponse pourquoi elle \u00e9tait all\u00e9e travailler ailleurs. On l'attendait \u00e0 Groupe Major Express depuis plus d'un an pass\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Pour donner suite \u00e0 cette conversation avec la plaignante et devant l'incertitude de son retour, M. Gaudreau dit qu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de confirmer la permanence de M. Genest au poste de r\u00e9partiteur principal.\n[42] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante n'a pas fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu'elle aurait eue avec M. Gaudreau au d\u00e9but novembre 2003. Je note \u00e9galement que l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas questionn\u00e9 la plaignante sur cette conversation.\n[43] M. Gaudreau fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une autre conversation qu'il aurait eue avec la plaignante en d\u00e9cembre 2003. Selon M. Gaudreau, la plaignante l'aurait appel\u00e9 pour l'informer qu'elle d\u00e9sirait revenir au travail le 12 janvier 2004. Il lui aurait alors dit qu'il fallait qu'elle se fasse une id\u00e9e. Tu travailles chez Liti\u00e8re Royale. Tu reviens, tu ne reviens pas.\n[44] Selon la plaignante, la conversation \u00e0 laquelle M. Gaudreau fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence n'aurait pas eu lieu en d\u00e9cembre 2003, mais plut\u00f4t en janvier 2004. Selon elle, c'est M. Gaudreau qui l'aurait appel\u00e9 pour lui offrir de revenir travailler chez l'intim\u00e9. Toujours selon la plaignante, il lui aurait offert un diff\u00e9rent poste \u00e0 un salaire de 23 000 $, ce qui est beaucoup inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui qu'elle gagnait avant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Il lui aurait aussi mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle n'occuperait plus le poste de r\u00e9partitrice principale. Selon la plaignante, cette offre \u00e9tait inacceptable, car, seulement du point de vue du salaire, elle gagnait plus chez Liti\u00e8re Royale, o\u00f9 elle recevait un salaire de 27 000 $. Elle pr\u00e9cise avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Gaudreau de lui faire parvenir son offre par \u00e9crit en ajoutant que de toute fa\u00e7on elle \u00e9tait de nouveau enceinte.\n[45] La plaignante ajoute n'avoir jamais re\u00e7u de confirmation \u00e9crite de l'offre que M. Gaudreau lui aurait faite en janvier 2004. Elle ajoute que pour sa part, elle n'a jamais donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cette conversation, car elle ne prenait pas l'offre au s\u00e9rieux.\n[46] M. Gaudreau ne niera pas avoir appel\u00e9 la plaignante chez elle, bien que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 ce sujet soit un peu confus : J'appelle [la plaignante] chez elle. C'est elle qui a appel\u00e9 pour savoir si son emploi est toujours l\u00e0 pour le 12 janvier. J'ai dit \u00e0 [la plaignante] vu ton exp\u00e9rience on va te faire une offre. On lui a offert 30 000 $ par ann\u00e9e. Le jeune [le stagiaire], il gagnait 27 000 $. Donc, elle avait plus d'exp\u00e9rience que le jeune donc je lui ai donn\u00e9 une majoration (sic). Au bout de trois mois on verra. Elle n'a jamais parl\u00e9 de mettre cela par \u00e9crit. Elle a dit OK, je te rappelle. Elle m'a rappel\u00e9 15 minutes apr\u00e8s pour me dire je refuse ton offre. Tu me donnes 40 000 $ par ann\u00e9e ou je ne reviens pas. Je lui ai dit que je ne pouvais pas lui payer 40 000 $ par ann\u00e9e. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 de faire son training de trois mois. Ton premier mois n'est m\u00eame pas fait. J'ai pas fini de te montrer la job. Elle a refus\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement. Elle m'a raccroch\u00e9 au nez. Elle a rappel\u00e9 et a dit qu'elle voulait 40 000 $. J'ai dit non je ne suis pas capable de te donner 40 000 $ et pas capable de te remettre \u00e0 ton poste comme avant tu n'as pas l'exp\u00e9rience pour \u00e7a. Elle a refus\u00e9 et a dit que de toute fa\u00e7on, je suis encore enceinte et elle m'a raccroch\u00e9 la ligne au nez.\n[47] En contre-interrogatoire, il ajoute qu'a la suite de cette conversation son refus [d'accepter son offre] devient lib\u00e9ratoire pour nous.\n[48] Apr\u00e8s leur conversation de janvier, M. Gaudreau aurait rappel\u00e9 la plaignante en mai ou juin 2004. D'apr\u00e8s la plaignante, il voulait savoir comment elle comptait lui rembourser un montant de 1 500 $ que l'employeur lui avait pay\u00e9 lors de son d\u00e9part en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. En effet, l'employeur avait alors pay\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante trois semaines de salaires dont deux devaient \u00eatre rembours\u00e9es par la Commission de la Sant\u00e9 et de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 au Travail du Qu\u00e9bec (la C.S.S.T.), du moins selon ce que les parties croyaient \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Toutefois, puisque l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait une entreprise f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la C.S.S.T. a refus\u00e9 de rembourser l'employeur. Dans une entente dat\u00e9e du 7 janvier 2003, la plaignante s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 rembourser ce montant par des paiements de 100 $ par semaine pendant quinze semaines d\u00e8s son retour au travail apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Selon la plaignante, lors de leur conversation de juin 2004, elle aurait dit \u00e0 son employeur qu'elle n'avait pas, \u00e0 ce moment, les moyens de rembourser cette somme. La question aurait finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e lors d'une sentence arbitrale rendue le 3 mars 2005 dans une proc\u00e9dure en vertu de la Section XVI de la Partie III du Code canadien du travail concernant les deux m\u00eames parties.\nC. APPLICATION DU DROIT AUX FAITS (i) La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins [49] Le fardeau initial incombe \u00e0 la plaignante d'\u00e9tablir un cas prima facie de discrimination. Une fois ce fardeau initial rencontr\u00e9, il incombe alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une justification ou une explication de la conduite discriminatoire qui lui est reproch\u00e9e. Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les parties s'est limit\u00e9e au t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante et \u00e0 celui de M. Gaudreau, pour l'intim\u00e9. Comme il fallait s'y attendre, ces deux t\u00e9moins n'avaient pas les m\u00eames souvenirs, ni la m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation des \u00e9v\u00e9nements pertinents. Sur plusieurs points, leurs t\u00e9moignages se sont contredits me for\u00e7ant de choisir lequel des deux t\u00e9moignages est le plus cr\u00e9dible, ce qui n'est jamais une t\u00e2che facile.\n[50] Sur la question de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, bien que son t\u00e9moignage ne fut pas exempt de contradictions et d'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9s, j'ai tendance, pour les raisons qui suivent, \u00e0 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer la preuve soumise par la plaignante. Entre autres, la plaignante a appuy\u00e9 plusieurs de ses affirmations avec une preuve \u00e9crite. Par exemple, elle a soumis en preuve une lettre dat\u00e9e du 14 avril 2003, qui informait son employeur qu'elle ne reviendrait au travail qu'en janvier 2004. Pour sa part, sur ce point, le t\u00e9moin de l'intim\u00e9 n'a fait qu'\u00e9mettre une accusation sans fondement voulant que la date de cette lettre e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 falsifi\u00e9e et que, quoi qu'il en soit, il ne l'ait re\u00e7u qu'au mois d'ao\u00fbt ou au mois de septembre 2003. Toutefois, il n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la copie de la lettre que son entreprise aurait re\u00e7ue et, \u00e0 ma question \u00e0 savoir si l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pas en sa possession une lettre avec un tampon indiquant la date de r\u00e9ception, il m'a r\u00e9pondu que ce n'\u00e9tait pas la pratique de l'intim\u00e9 d'apposer un tampon indiquant la date de r\u00e9ception sur les lettres qu'il recevait. Cette explication ne m'a pas convaincu et d'ailleurs elle n'explique pas pourquoi la lettre du mois d'ao\u00fbt ou septembre 2004 n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 produite.\n[51] Je constate \u00e9galement que lors de son contre-interrogatoire de la plaignante, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 ne l'a pas vraiment interrog\u00e9 sur le contenu de cette lettre et surtout il n'a pas attir\u00e9 l'attention de celle-ci sur le fait que son t\u00e9moin allait t\u00e9moigner qu'il n'avait pas re\u00e7u la lettre en avril et qu'il mettrait m\u00eame en doute la date qui \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9e sur celle-ci. \u00c0 cet effet, je rappelle que la r\u00e8gle \u00e9tablie dans l'arr\u00eat Browne c. Dunn (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L.), oblige l'avocat, \u00e0 moins que le t\u00e9moin n'ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u un avis que sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 serait mise en question, \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les t\u00e9moins dont il entend mettre en doute la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement. La justification de cette r\u00e8gle a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e ainsi par lord Herschell, aux pages 70-71, de la d\u00e9cision :\n[Traduction] Bien, vos Seigneuries, je ne peux m'emp\u00eacher d'affirmer qu'il m'appara\u00eet absolument essentiel au d\u00e9roulement r\u00e9gulier d'une instance, lorsqu'un avocat entend sugg\u00e9rer qu'un t\u00e9moin ne dit pas la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur un point en particulier, d'attitrer l'attention de ce t\u00e9moin sur ce fait en lui posant en contre-interrogatoire certains questions indiquant qu'on fera cette imputation, et non d'accepter son t\u00e9moignage et d'en faire abstraction comme s'il \u00e9tait absolument incontest\u00e9 puis, lorsqu'il lui est impossible d'expliquer - ce qu'il aurait peut-\u00eatre pu faire si ces questions lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es - les circonstances qui, pr\u00e9tend-on, montrent que sa version des faits ne doit pas \u00eatre retenu, de soutenir qu'il n'est pas un t\u00e9moin digne de foi. Vos Seigneuries, il m'a toujours sembl\u00e9 que l'avocat qui entend mettre en doute le t\u00e9moignage d'une personne doit, lorsque cette personne se trouve \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins, lui donner l'occasion d'offrir toute explication qu'elle est en mesure de pr\u00e9senter. De plus, il me semble qu'il ne s'agit pas seulement d'une r\u00e8gle de pratique professionnelle dans la conduite d'une affaire, mais \u00e9galement d'une attitude essentielle pour agir de fa\u00e7on loyale envers les t\u00e9moins. On souligne parfois le caract\u00e8re excessif du contre-interrogatoire auquel un t\u00e9moin est soumis, reprochant \u00e0 ce contre-interrogatoire d'\u00eatre abusif. Toutefois, il me semble qu'un contre-interrogatoire men\u00e9 par un avocat p\u00e9chant par exc\u00e8s de z\u00e8le peut se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler beaucoup plus \u00e9quitable pour le t\u00e9moin que le fait de ne pas le contre-interroger puis de sugg\u00e9rer qu'il ne dit pas la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, je veux dire sur un point \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard duquel il n'est par ailleurs pas clair qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement inform\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable qu'on entendait mettre en doute sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de sa version des faits.\n( Voir \u00e9galement : R. v. Lyttle, [2004] 1 R.C.S. 193 et Sopinka, Lederman et Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd ed., LexisNexis Butterworth, pp. 954-957. )\n[52] De plus, bien que sur certains aspects le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante ait \u00e9galement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 certaines contradictions, j'ai trouv\u00e9, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, son t\u00e9moignage beaucoup plus cr\u00e9dible que celui du t\u00e9moin de l'intim\u00e9.\n[53] En ce qui concerne la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 17 octobre 2003, la plaignante soumettra en preuve une lettre dat\u00e9e du 22 octobre 2003, confirmant la teneur des discussions qu'elle aurait eues alors avec M. Gaudreau. M. Gaudreau ne niera pas avoir re\u00e7u cette lettre, bien qu'il dise ne pas s'en souvenir. Je note \u00e9galement que lors du contre-interrogatoire de la plaignante, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 de voir le re\u00e7u de la poste confirmant l'envoi de cette lettre par courrier recommand\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 ce document, Me Jobidon ne posa aucune autre question au t\u00e9moin sur ce point, ni ne demandera que le re\u00e7u soit produit en preuve. J'en conclus que le document confirmait l'envoi de la lettre aux environs de la date pr\u00e9vue. J'en conclus \u00e9galement que le contenu de la lettre refl\u00e8te fid\u00e8lement la conversation qui a eu lieu entre ces deux individus, puisqu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9.\n[54] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Gaudreau a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 deux conversations qu'il dit avoir eues avec la plaignante, en novembre et en d\u00e9cembre 2003. La plaignante n'a jamais fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ces conversations et elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9e \u00e0 leur sujet. Selon M. Gaudreau, c'est lors de la conversation de novembre qu'il a appris que la plaignante travaillait chez Liti\u00e8re Royale. Il ajoute que suite \u00e0 cette conversation, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de confirmer la permanence de M. Genest, le rempla\u00e7ant de la plaignante, au poste de r\u00e9partiteur principal. Or, par la suite le t\u00e9moignage de M. Gaudreau devient difficile \u00e0 suivre. Selon lui, la plaignante l'aurait \u00e0 nouveau contact\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2003 pour l'informer qu'elle \u00e9tait toujours int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 revenir travailler pour l'intim\u00e9 en janvier 2004. M. Gaudreau lui aurait alors dit qu'il fallait qu'elle se fasse une id\u00e9e. Tu travailles chez Liti\u00e8re Royale. Tu reviens, tu ne reviens pas. Si l'intim\u00e9 avait appris, comme l'indique M. Gaudreau, au d\u00e9but du mois de novembre que la plaignante avait accept\u00e9 un poste ailleurs et que cela l'avait amen\u00e9 \u00e0 confirmer M. Genest dans le poste de r\u00e9partiteur principal, alors pourquoi a-t-il \u00e0 nouveau discut\u00e9 avec elle, en d\u00e9cembre, de son retour possible au travail?\n[55] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Gaudreau expliquera qu'il avait accept\u00e9 de reprendre la plaignante m\u00eame s'il venait d'accorder la permanence \u00e0 M. Genest. Il ajoute que le poste de second r\u00e9partiteur \u00e9tait toujours disponible car nous avions pris la d\u00e9cision de mettre \u00e0 pied le second r\u00e9partiteur [le stagiaire] pour le remplacer par la [plaignante]. Mais alors, pourquoi avoir agi ainsi, si d\u00e9j\u00e0 en novembre 2003, il consid\u00e9rait que la plaignante avait quitt\u00e9 son emploi? La d\u00e9cision de remercier le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2003, le stagiaire qui occupait le poste de deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9partiteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise, selon M. Gaudreau, en raison du retour possible de la plaignante. En cons\u00e9quence, cette conversation, si elle a eu lieu, doit donc s'\u00eatre d\u00e9roul\u00e9e avant le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2003, date \u00e0 laquelle le stagiaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 remerci\u00e9 de ses services. Dans ce cas, pourquoi M. Gaudreau n'a-t-il pas inform\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 ce moment que l'intim\u00e9 n'allait pas la reprendre au poste de r\u00e9partiteur principal, d'autant plus qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 confirm\u00e9 M. Genest \u00e0 ce poste?\n[56] La chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements telle que pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Gaudreau est difficile \u00e0 suivre. Bien qu'il affirme avoir parl\u00e9 avec la plaignante de son retour possible lors d'une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique en d\u00e9cembre 2003, il semble que ce n'est que lors d'une conversation en janvier 2004, qu'il l'aurait inform\u00e9 que l'entreprise \u00e9tait en train de revoir le salaire des employ\u00e9s en raison de ses difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res. Il aurait m\u00eame indiqu\u00e9 que tous les salaires sont r\u00e9duits de 15%. Il ajoute que lors de cette conversation : On a fait part \u00e0 [la plaignante] qu'on va la reprendre, mais qu'on va ren\u00e9gocier son salaire, car l'entreprise ne peut payer deux salaires de 40 000 $. Fran\u00e7ois [le stagiaire] est parti le 22 d\u00e9cembre. La plaignante a rappel\u00e9 le 10 janvier et a demand\u00e9 si le travail \u00e9tait pr\u00eat. J'ai dit oui, on est pr\u00eat \u00e0 te reprendre. Vu le training que tu n'as pu compl\u00e9ter au d\u00e9but de ton emploi, vu ton manque d'exp\u00e9rience, on te repart comme deuxi\u00e8me dispatch derri\u00e8re Antoine qui avait \u00e0 ce moment un an d'exp\u00e9rience. On ne peut pas te remettre premi\u00e8re avec deux semaines de training. En 2003, on \u00e9tait rendu \u00e0 30 camions et non 20 comme \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle avait d\u00e9but\u00e9.\n[57] Lorsque M. Gaudreau affirme que l'entreprise ne peut pas payer deux salaires de 40 000 $, il fait \u00e9videmment r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que M. Antoine Genest occupe maintenant le poste de premier r\u00e9partiteur et qu'il re\u00e7oit un salaire de 40 000 $. Pourtant en contre-interrogatoire, il pr\u00e9cisera : Il [Antoine Genest] a occup\u00e9 le poste de r\u00e9partiteur jusqu'en septembre 2004. Il a quitt\u00e9 le poste en raison de sa sant\u00e9. Il savait au d\u00e9but que c'\u00e9tait un poste temporaire, mais parce qu'on ne savait pas quand [la plaignante] reviendrait cela s'\u00e9ternisait. (C'est moi qui souligne.) Ainsi, M. Genest devait occuper ce poste sur une base temporaire jusqu'au retour de la plaignante. L'intim\u00e9 n'avait donc aucune intention au d\u00e9part de le confirmer dans ce poste sur une base permanente; il lui demandait de remplacer la plaignante pendant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Il n'\u00e9tait \u00e9galement aucunement question, lors de l'embauche de M. Genest, du fait que la plaignante n'avait pas termin\u00e9 sa p\u00e9riode d'entra\u00eenement.\n[58] M. Gaudreau ne niera pas avoir appel\u00e9 la plaignante chez elle en janvier 2004, bien que son t\u00e9moignage soit un peu confus : J'appelle [la plaignante] chez elle. C'est elle qui a appel\u00e9 pour savoir si son emploi est toujours l\u00e0 pour le 12 janvier. D'une phrase \u00e0 l'autre, il se contredit affirmant en premier avoir appel\u00e9 la plaignante, pour ajouter imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s que c'est la plaignante qui aurait appel\u00e9. Selon la teneur de cette conversation reproduite plus haut, l'intim\u00e9 voulait ren\u00e9gocier le salaire de la plaignante en soutenant qu'elle n'avait pas termin\u00e9 son entra\u00eenement. Or, le contrat d'embauche ne pr\u00e9voit pas de p\u00e9riode d'entra\u00eenement, ni la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9duction salariale en cas de cong\u00e9 prolong\u00e9.\n[59] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Gaudreau ajoute un commentaire int\u00e9ressant : Son refus devient lib\u00e9ratoire pour nous. J'interpr\u00e8te ce commentaire comme une indication qu'\u00e0 partir de ce moment l'intim\u00e9 consid\u00e9rait les liens d'emploi avec la plaignante comme \u00e9tant rompus. Cette affirmation est pour le moins \u00e9tonnante \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de son t\u00e9moignage un peu plus t\u00f4t voulant qu'il ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9, suite \u00e0 sa conversation de novembre 2003 avec la plaignante, de confirmer M. Genest dans le poste de r\u00e9partiteur principal, le poste qu'occupait la plaignante. Au moment o\u00f9 M. Gaudreau a confirm\u00e9 M. Genest dans le poste, il \u00e9tait conscient du fait que la plaignante s'attendait toujours \u00e0 revenir travailler pour l'intim\u00e9. Or, il semble maintenant que ce ne sont pas les conversations de novembre et d\u00e9cembre 2003 qui sont lib\u00e9ratoires, mais plut\u00f4t le refus de la plaignante, en janvier 2004, d'accepter un poste diff\u00e9rent \u00e0 un salaire moindre.\n[60] Pour toutes ces raisons, je n'accorde pas une grande cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 au t\u00e9moignage du t\u00e9moin de l'intim\u00e9 et lorsque celui-ci contredira celui de la plaignante, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8rerai le t\u00e9moignage de celle-ci.\n(ii) Le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 [61] Bien que la grossesse ne soit ni un accident, ni une maladie et qu'il s'agisse tr\u00e8s souvent d'un \u00e9tat voulu, il est incontestable qu'elle est un motif de sant\u00e9 valable pour s'absenter du travail. Pour l'employ\u00e9e, les cons\u00e9quences \u00e9conomiques de l'incapacit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches que son travail comporte sont les m\u00eames que cette incapacit\u00e9 r\u00e9sulte d'une grossesse ou d'un autre motif de sant\u00e9 entra\u00eenant l'absence du travail. Or, ne pas consid\u00e9rer la grossesse de cette fa\u00e7on va \u00e0 l'encontre de l'un des objets des lois anti-discrimination \u00e0 savoir la suppression des d\u00e9savantages injustes impos\u00e9s \u00e0 des personnes ou \u00e0 des groupes dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. (Voir l'article 2 de la Loi qui parle du droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement.) De plus, nous pouvons consid\u00e9rer ce d\u00e9savantage comme un d\u00e9savantage impos\u00e9 aux femmes, car elles sont les seules \u00e0 pouvoir donner naissance. D'ailleurs, le Parlement a codifi\u00e9 cette constatation au par. 3(2) de la Loi qui pr\u00e9voit sp\u00e9cifiquement qu' une distinction fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse ou l'accouchement est r\u00e9put\u00e9e fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[62] Il en ressort \u00e9galement qu'en concluant que les femmes, suite \u00e0 un accouchement, n'ont pas droit \u00e0 des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 sans subir d'effets n\u00e9fastes sur leur emploi, on saperait un des objectifs des lois anti-discrimination en cautionnant une des fa\u00e7ons les plus marqu\u00e9es de les d\u00e9savantager. Ce serait avaliser l'imposition aux femmes d'une part disproportionn\u00e9e des co\u00fbts de la grossesse. La suppression des fardeaux injustes impos\u00e9s aux femmes et aux autres groupes dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 constitue un objet clef des lois anti-discrimination. (Voir Brooks c. Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1219, aux paras 28 et 29.)\n[63] L'objet du cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 n'est pas l'encouragement de la constitution de familles. Il vise plut\u00f4t la protection de la sant\u00e9 et du bien-\u00eatre des femmes enceintes et des nouvelles m\u00e8res. Il va de soit que la grossesse et l'accouchement mettent la sant\u00e9 de la nouvelle m\u00e8re \u00e0 rude \u00e9preuve. Le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 vise \u00e0 leur permettre de se relever de leur \u00e9tat afin qu'elles puissent dans les meilleures conditions possibles retourner sur le march\u00e9 du travail. (Voir B.C. Government and Service Employees Union c. British Columbia (2002), 216 D.L.R. (4th) 322, au par. 17, tel que traduit dans Tomasson c. Canada (Procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 C.A.F. 265).\n[64] Dans le cas qui nous int\u00e9resse, la plaignante \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 parental lorsque son employeur l'avisa en octobre 2003 qu'elle n'avait plus sa place au sein de son entreprise et qu'elle devait se chercher un emploi ailleurs. Bien qu'il soit vrai qu'il a en janvier 2004, offert un poste \u00e0 la plaignante, ce poste n'\u00e9tait pas celui qu'elle avait occup\u00e9 avant de devoir prendre un cong\u00e9 de maladie en raison de sa grossesse. L'emploi qui lui \u00e9tait propos\u00e9 par l'employeur constituait une r\u00e9trogradation, accompagn\u00e9 d'une baisse substantielle de salaire.\n[65] De l'ensemble de la preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, je conclus que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une cause prima facie que l'intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en raison de sa grossesse en refusant de la reprendre \u00e0 son emploi, au m\u00eame poste et au m\u00eame salaire, \u00e0 la suite de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et de son cong\u00e9 parental.\n[66] Le fardeau se d\u00e9place maintenant sur l'intim\u00e9, qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve qui lui permet de rencontrer ce fardeau. En premier lieu, il donne comme explication que la plaignante avait accept\u00e9 un travail ailleurs en novembre 2003. Par la suite, il t\u00e9moigne qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e8s \u00e0 reprendre la plaignante en janvier 2004, mais dans un autre poste et \u00e0 un salaire moindre puisqu'elle n'avait pas termin\u00e9 sont entra\u00eenement et que son rempla\u00e7ant avait plus d'exp\u00e9rience qu'elle. Or, comme nous l'avons vu plus haut, cette explication n'\u00e9tait pas convaincante et contredisait la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante. Le caract\u00e8re incomplet et les contradictions de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure qu'il n'a pas fourni une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e.\n[67] J'en conclus donc que la plainte de Madame Germain \u00e0 l'encontre de son employeur, Groupe Major Express Inc. est fond\u00e9e.\nD. REDRESSEMENTS [68] Au niveau des redressements sollicit\u00e9s par la plaignante, je dois faire face au m\u00eame probl\u00e8me que j'avais lors de la d\u00e9cision sur le fond avec la preuve de l'intim\u00e9, mais cette fois-ci c'est la preuve de la plaignante qui est loin d'\u00eatre satisfaisante et concluante. Voici donc en r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\n[69] La plaignante ne r\u00e9clame pas sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration au sein de l'\u00e9quipe de l'intim\u00e9. Elle r\u00e9clame cependant le salaire qu'elle dit avoir perdu en raison de son cong\u00e9diement. Je constate toutefois qu'aucune preuve concr\u00e8te n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e pour \u00e9tayer cette r\u00e9clamation.\n[70] Tout au plus, m'a-t-elle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un historique de son emploi depuis novembre 2003. Ainsi, de novembre 2003 jusqu'\u00e0 mars 2004, la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 pour Liti\u00e8re Royale. En mars 2004, son m\u00e9decin l'a mise en retrait pr\u00e9ventif en raison de sa grossesse. Le 25 ao\u00fbt 2004, elle a accouch\u00e9 de son deuxi\u00e8me enfant. Suite \u00e0 son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, elle n'est pas retourn\u00e9e travailler chez Liti\u00e8re Royale. Elle explique qu'elle venait de se s\u00e9parer du p\u00e8re de son deuxi\u00e8me enfant et puisque celui-ci travaillait \u00e9galement pour Liti\u00e8re Royale, elle ne se sentait pas \u00e0 l'aise d'y retourner.\n[71] Apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 Liti\u00e8re Royale, elle dit avoir travaill\u00e9, \u00e0 partir de septembre 2005, pendant trois mois, pour une compagnie de courtage en transport nomm\u00e9 Voyageur 2000. Elle ajoute que c'\u00e9tait un travail \u00e0 temps plein et qu'elle recevait un salaire de 35 000 $ par ann\u00e9e. Elle explique avoir quitt\u00e9 ce poste puisque, en raison de sa r\u00e9cente s\u00e9paration, elle avait d\u00fb quitter le foyer familial et retourner vivre chez sa m\u00e8re.\n[72] Puisqu'elle avait \u00e9puis\u00e9 son assurance-emploi pendant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, elle dit avoir retir\u00e9 de l'assistance sociale pour la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi son d\u00e9part de chez Voyageur 2000. En juillet 2006, elle est all\u00e9e travailler pour Saint-Lambert Transport, un courtier en transport. Finalement, le 20 novembre 2006, elle s'est trouv\u00e9 un emploi \u00e0 temps partiel avec FEDEX. Bien qu'elle dit \u00eatre toujours \u00e0 l'emploi de FEDEX, elle ajoute \u00eatre en cong\u00e9 parental depuis le 2 mars 2008, puisqu'elle doit accoucher le 16 juin 2008. De plus, elle pr\u00e9cise que depuis septembre 2007, elle est en arr\u00eat de travail.\n[73] Je ne peux sur la base de cette preuve incompl\u00e8te conclure que la plaignante a subi une perte de salaire et je n'\u00e9mettrai donc aucune ordonnance \u00e0 cet effet.\n[74] La plaignante r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement un montant de 20 000 $ en dommages moraux, aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi soutenant que l'action de l'intim\u00e9 l'a priv\u00e9 de trois mois de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Elle pr\u00e9cise avoir d\u00fb se trouver une gardienne en catastrophe au mois de novembre, car elle devait se trouver un emploi et que cela avait chambard\u00e9 sa vie lui occasionnant du m\u00eame coup un certain stress.\n[75] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience pour soutenir cette r\u00e9clamation m'appara\u00eet pour le moins mince et certainement insuffisante pour justifier le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par la plaignante qui est le maximum pr\u00e9vu par la Loi. Cette preuve se limite au t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante voulant qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e par la conduite de l'intim\u00e9e. (Voir Transport Jeannot Gagnon c. Dumont 2002 CFPI 1280).\n[76] Toutefois, je conviens que la conduite de l'intim\u00e9e a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e0 la plaignante, si ce n'est qu'en terme d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. J'accorde donc une indemnit\u00e9 de 3 500 $ au titre de pr\u00e9judice moral.\n[77] La plaignante r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement un montant afin de pouvoir rembourser ses frais d'avocat. Pour appuyer cette r\u00e9clamation, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve un accord d'honoraire conditionnel qu'elle avait conclu avec son avocat. Je ne peux sur la base de cette preuve acquiescer \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante. Un accord d'honoraire conditionnel ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une preuve des honoraires que la plaignante devra vers\u00e9e \u00e0 son avocat.\n[78] L'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur le montant de 3 500 $ accord\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de redressement est payable en conformit\u00e9 du paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi. Il devra \u00eatre calcul\u00e9 selon la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits la personne (03-01-04) au taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d'escompte fix\u00e9 par la banque du Canada. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat courra \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte jusqu'\u00e0 la date du versement de l'indemnit\u00e9.\nsign\u00e9e par Michel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 25 juillet 2008\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1179\/6106\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nMagaly Germain c.

Grant Sinclair Date : Le 1er ao\u00fbt 2008 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2008 TCDP 34\n[1] La plaignante, l'Association des employ\u00e9s pour l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale de la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne le 27 novembre 2001, en vertu des articles 10 et 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Les intim\u00e9s sont le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada (le CT) et la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique (la CRTFP).\n[2] La plaignante introduit maintenant une requ\u00eate au Tribunal pour obtenir l'ajournement de la proc\u00e9dure en attendant la diffusion de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'action Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada et al c. Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine du Chef du Canada.\n[3] L'AFPC a introduit cette action \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le 8 novembre 2000. La demande de l'AFPC a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour le compte d'employ\u00e9s de sept minist\u00e8res ou organismes gouvernementaux distincts, employ\u00e9s qui n'avaient pas obtenu les m\u00eames salaires et avantages qui \u00e9taient offerts aux employ\u00e9s du CT apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal du 29 juillet 1998 en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale et l'ordonnance sur consentement du Tribunal du 16 novembre 1999. L'AFPC soutient que le d\u00e9faut d'offrir un salaire et des avantages \u00e9quitables viole l'article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[4] L'association qui est la plaignante ainsi que les intim\u00e9s, le CT et la CRTFP, ne sont pas parties dans l'action devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La CRTFP est un employeur distinct en vertu de la Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique.\n[5] Compte tenu des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, il semble que la question principale, sinon la seule question, dans l'action de l'AFPC est celle de savoir qui est l'employeur des employ\u00e9s des sept minist\u00e8res ou organismes distincts.\n[6] La plaignante soutient dans sa requ\u00eate que le r\u00e8glement de cette question dans l'action de l'AFPC sera persuasive, qu'elle permettra de restreindre les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi et pourra peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame permettre d'\u00e9viter la tenue d'une audience devant le Tribunal. La plaignante soutient que c'est le cas parce que [traduction] l'interpr\u00e9tation du terme employeur est la question fondamentale dans l'action de l'AFPC et dans la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[7] La plaignante ne donne aucune explication au sujet de la raison pour laquelle il s'agit d'une [traduction] question fondamentale pour le Tribunal, et il est impossible d'en d\u00e9duire une. Cependant, m\u00eame en supposant que c'est bien le cas, la plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 devant le Tribunal, lors de s\u00e9ances de gestion de l'instance avant l'audience, que si l'action de l'AFPC \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, elle poursuivrait tout de m\u00eame sa plainte devant le Tribunal. Dans un m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils souhaitent que la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal se poursuive, m\u00eame si l'action de l'AFPC est accueillie \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[8] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la jurisprudence du Tribunal est tr\u00e8s claire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 des requ\u00eates en ajournement de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal dans les affaires Leger c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada et Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pr\u00e9cisent que le Tribunal ne devrait exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re d'ajournement que lorsque les principes de la justice naturelle l'exigent. Les arguments qui pourraient justifier un ajournement comprennent le retard \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter la plainte, la non-disponibilit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moins ou de preuves, le besoin de trouver un avocat et la divulgation tardive, qui peuvent tous porter atteinte \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 d'une partie de parvenir \u00e0 une pleine repr\u00e9sentation devant le Tribunal. Compte tenu de cette jurisprudence, je ne rel\u00e8ve rien dans la requ\u00eate de la plaignante qui justifie un ajournement.\n[9] Le fait que le Tribunal n'a pas tenu d'audience dans l'affaire Thwaites et al, Boyes et al, Adamson et al, Bakker et al et Delf c. Air Canada et l'Association des pilotes d'Air Canada n'aide pas la plaignante. Ces plaintes soulevaient les m\u00eames questions que le Tribunal avait tranch\u00e9es dans Vilven & Kelly c. Air Canada et l'Association des pilotes d'Air Canada, d\u00e9cision qui fait pr\u00e9sentement l'objet d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Les faits soulev\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate de la plaignante sont compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rents.\n[10] L'audition de l'action de l'AFPC est pr\u00e9vue en octobre 2008 et devrait durer 40 jours. Compte tenu de cela, en plus du temps n\u00e9cessaire pour rendre une d\u00e9cision (en supposant qu'il n'y aura pas d'appel), l'audience du Tribunal pourrait \u00eatre report\u00e9e pendant une autre ann\u00e9e. Cela signifie que l'audience devant le Tribunal aurait lieu au moins huit ans apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, ce qui ne respecte certainement pas le mandat du Tribunal selon lequel les instances devant le Tribunal doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es rapidement.\n[11] Tel qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9cisions Leger et Baltruweit, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est l'instance appropri\u00e9e pour obtenir un ajournement \u00e0 une audience du Tribunal.

Jensen\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] Tout juste avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience visant \u00e0 trancher des questions relatives aux mesures de redressement, la Commission et les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant la production de documents qui se trouvent en la possession d'une personne que les intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9voyaient appeler comme t\u00e9moin expert. Les intim\u00e9s ont r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 que les documents \u00e9taient assujettis au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige.\n[2] J'ai report\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution de la question \u00e0 l'audience en d\u00e9clarant que je prendrais une d\u00e9cision au besoin, en temps et lieu. Au cours de l'audience, les avocats des plaignants m'ont demand\u00e9 de rendre une d\u00e9cision avant le t\u00e9moignage du t\u00e9moin expert des intim\u00e9s. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 que je n'\u00e9tais pas tenu d'attendre jusqu'au contre-interrogatoire du t\u00e9moin pour le faire, mais que je pouvais plut\u00f4t ordonner la production des documents en question.\n[3] Pour les motifs suivants, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il n'y a aucun droit d'exiger la production automatique du dossier de l'expert une fois que le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, comme les plaignants le pr\u00e9tendent. J'ai plut\u00f4t conclu que le Tribunal doit examiner les documents afin de d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu renonciation au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige. Si c'est le cas, il doit ordonner la production des documents. J'ai communiqu\u00e9 de vive voix un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de mes motifs.

Canada (Commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e), 2008 CSC 44, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que le Commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e n'avait pas la comp\u00e9tence pour examiner les documents pour lesquels le privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l'avocat a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9. La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que des termes explicites sont requis pour \u00e9carter le privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l'avocat parce que ce privil\u00e8ge est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 inviolable (Blood Tribe, au paragraphe 26).\n[5] La question dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire diff\u00e8re de celle dans l'arr\u00eat Blood Tribe. En l'esp\u00e8ce, il est question du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige. Comme l'a soulign\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame dans Blank c. Canada (Ministre de la Justice), 2006 CSC 39, le cadre l\u00e9gislatif du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige et du privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l'avocat est diff\u00e9rent. Ces deux privil\u00e8ges reposent sur des consid\u00e9rations de principe diff\u00e9rentes et entra\u00eenent des cons\u00e9quences juridiques diff\u00e9rentes. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne crois pas que le raisonnement \u00e9tabli dans Blood Tribe s'applique \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nII. Deuxi\u00e8me question : Y a-t-il automatiquement renonciation au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du dossier de l'expert une fois que celui-ci est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner? [6] Le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige signifie que les documents pr\u00e9par\u00e9s principalement aux fins du litige, y compris les rapports d'expert, n'ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s aux parties adverses sauf s'il y a renonciation au privil\u00e8ge; voir Blank, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. Cependant, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la partie qui a command\u00e9 un rapport d'expert renoncera au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige et d\u00e9posera le rapport aupr\u00e8s de la cour. \u00c0 la suite de la renonciation au privil\u00e8ge, les parties adverses ont le droit de voir ce rapport ainsi que tout autre document dans le dossier de l'expert; voir Lax Kw'alaams Indian Band c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 BCSC 909.\n[7] Les tribunaux canadiens ont adopt\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes approches pour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la renonciation au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige. Les intim\u00e9s affirment que par l'application des articles 2 et 40 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, le Tribunal est oblig\u00e9 d'appliquer la loi en Ontario. L'article 40 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada pr\u00e9voit que dans toutes les proc\u00e9dures qui rel\u00e8vent de l'autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative du Parlement, les lois sur la preuve qui sont en vigueur dans la province o\u00f9 ces proc\u00e9dures sont exerc\u00e9es s'appliquent \u00e0 ces proc\u00e9dures.\n[8] Je ne suis pas certaine que l'on puisse dire que les proc\u00e9dures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es en Ontario. Mme Walden n'a pas pris de chance en d\u00e9posant sa plainte en Ontario, mais elle n'est pas la seule plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il y a environ 400 autres plaignants qui habitent et travaillent dans diff\u00e9rentes provinces du Canada. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu aux plaintes se sont produits dans plus d'une province.\n[9] Les parties ont conclu une entente selon laquelle les plaignants, \u00e0 l'exception de Mme Walden, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme ayant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte lorsqu'ils ont communiqu\u00e9 avec un repr\u00e9sentant r\u00e9gional des plaignants, qui a inscrit leur nom sur une liste des plaignants. Sinon, les plaignants auraient probablement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes individuelles aupr\u00e8s des bureaux r\u00e9gionaux de la Commission partout au Canada.\n[10] Il faut \u00e9galement reconna\u00eetre que les proc\u00e9dures en cause sont de nature administrative et les premiers documents introductifs (les plaintes) n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s d'un palais de justice local, mais plut\u00f4t aupr\u00e8s d'un organisme f\u00e9d\u00e9ral (la Commission), qui a un mandat national. De plus, les demandes de la Commission pour la tenue d'une instruction sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal, qui a \u00e9galement un mandat national.\n[11] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, il est pratiquement impossible de cerner une seule province comme lieu o\u00f9 les proc\u00e9dures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es. Ainsi, m\u00eame s'il faut recourir \u00e0 la jurisprudence des cours sup\u00e9rieures provinciales, le droit de la preuve d'une province ne peut pas facilement suppl\u00e9er le droit d'une autre province. En outre, il semble ressortir de l'examen de la jurisprudence mentionn\u00e9e par les parties, de m\u00eame que des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents connexes, qu'un consensus sur l'\u00e9tat du droit dans une province donn\u00e9e n'est pas toujours perceptible. Pour ces motifs, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas limiter mon examen du droit \u00e0 la juridiction de l'Ontario.\n[12] Il existe au moins deux approches au Canada de renonciation au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige : l'une favorise une production accrue et l'autre penche vers une interpr\u00e9tation plus restrictive de la renonciation au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige.\n[13] L'affaire Vancouver Community College c. Phillips, Barratt, (1987), 20 B.C.L.R. (2d) 289, est un exemple de l'approche qui favorise une production accrue. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique a conclu que l'exception quant au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige s'\u00e9tend de fa\u00e7on large \u00e0 tous les documents qui se trouvent en la possession du t\u00e9moin et qui sont utiles \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration ou \u00e0 la formulation des opinions \u00e9mises, ainsi qu'\u00e0 la coh\u00e9rence, \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du t\u00e9moin et \u00e0 toute autre question portant sur sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9; voir \u00e9galement Jesionowski c. Gorecki, [1992] C.A.F. no 816; Browne (Litigation Guardian of) c. Lavery, [2002] O.J. no 564 (C.S.).\n[14] Ce ne sont pas tous les tribunaux qui se sont montr\u00e9s dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter d'une fa\u00e7on si large la renonciation au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige. Par exemple, dans Bell Canada c. Olympia and York Developments Ltd. (1989), 68 O.R. (2d) 103 (H.C.J.), la cour \u00e9tait saisie d'une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obliger un expert \u00e0 produire toute la correspondance entre l'avocat donnant instruction et lui-m\u00eame. La cour a refus\u00e9 d'ordonner la production demand\u00e9e et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en acceptant de le faire, le privil\u00e8ge avocat-client serait mis en p\u00e9ril. Ainsi, la cour a refus\u00e9 d'appliquer le raisonnement \u00e9tabli dans Vancouver Community College, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9; voir aussi Edmonton (City) c. Lovat Tunnel Equipment Inc., 2000 ABQB 182; R. c. 1278481 Ontario Ltd., 2007 NLTD 151; Highland Fisheries Ltd. c. Lynk Electric Ltd. (1989), 63 D.L.R. (4th) 493 (C.S. de la N.-\u00c9.); Martin c. Inglis, 2002 SKQB 24.\n[15] Je crois que l'approche adopt\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la common law sur le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige et la renonciation dans Lax Kw'alaams Indian Band c. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 BCSC 909, constitue une approche \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e pour trancher la question. Cette affaire concerne une demande visant la production des dossiers de travail de trois t\u00e9moins experts pour la d\u00e9fense, soit des biologistes. Les dossiers comprenaient des rapports provisoires, de la correspondance entre les avocats et les experts ainsi que d'autres types de rapports.\n[16] La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nJe ne crois pas que les d\u00e9clarations formul\u00e9es dans Vancouver Community College c. Phillips, Barratt par le juge Finch, tel \u00e9tait alors son titre, concernant les exceptions \u00e0 la renonciation au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des exceptions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qui s'appliqueront \u00e0 toutes les affaires quelles que soit les circonstances. Le juge \u00e9non\u00e7ait des exemples o\u00f9 il pouvait y avoir exception, mais le principe qu'il adoptait \u00e9tait celui selon lequel la cour doit trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre les politiques concurrentes de la divulgation et du privil\u00e8ge et d\u00e9terminer ce qui est juste dans chacun des cas (Lax Kw'alaams Indian Band, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 15).\n[17] Pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu renonciation au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige, le d\u00e9cideur doit tenir compte du principe suivant : lorsqu'un expert qui n'est pas une partie est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, ou lorsque son rapport est produit en preuve, il devra peut-\u00eatre produire des documents en sa possession qui se rapportent ou pourraient se rapporter \u00e0 des questions de fond quant \u00e0 sa preuve ou sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, sauf s'il est injuste ou incorrect d'exiger une telle production.\n[18] La Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 le diff\u00e9rend en examinant les documents de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige s'appliquait. La Cour a conclu que certains des documents devaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s parce qu'ils touchaient le fondement de l'opinion du t\u00e9moin ou de sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9; voir aussi Pich\u00e9 et als c. Lecours Lumber Co. Ltd. et al (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 193, o\u00f9 la Cour de l'Ontario (Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) a adopt\u00e9 une approche semblable pour r\u00e9soudre des r\u00e9clamations concernant le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige, mais en appliquant un diff\u00e9rent crit\u00e8re.\n[19] Il importe \u00e9galement de noter qu'un certain nombre de cours ayant adopt\u00e9 une approche semblable \u00e0 celle adopt\u00e9e par la cour dans Lax Kw'alaam Indian Band, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, se sont fond\u00e9es sur un passage tir\u00e9 du texte de Sopinka et Lederman intitul\u00e9 The Law of Evidence in Canada, dans lequel les auteurs font des observations sur le Coll\u00e8ge communautaire de Vancouver en d\u00e9clarant ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nQuant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l'expert, il faut faire preuve de prudence avant que cela ne devienne le fondement de la divulgation g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e de toute correspondance entre l'avocat et l'expert ainsi que des rapports provisoires. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, les avocats pourraient adopter la pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de d\u00e9truire les \u00e9bauches une fois qu'elles ne sont plus utiles pour simplement \u00e9viter le probl\u00e8me; voir Sopinka et Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Canada (2nd ed.), \u00e0 la page 763, cit\u00e9 dans Martin c. Inglis, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 10.\n[20] Je crois qu'il est important de ne pas oublier ces commentaires lorsqu'il s'agit d'\u00e9valuer s'il y a eu renonciation au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des documents qui se trouvent en la possession de l'expert.\n[21] J'ai demand\u00e9 aux parties de me fournir une copie des documents \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard desquels le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige est invoqu\u00e9. J'ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que je les examinerais afin de d\u00e9cider s'il y avait eu renonciation au privil\u00e8ge en tenant compte des principes susmentionn\u00e9s.\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] L'intim\u00e9e, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de l'Outaouais (STO), a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d'adjoindre la Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton (OC Transpo) et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec (le PGQ) \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9s dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Bob Brown contre la STO. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, OC Transpo et le PGQ s'opposent \u00e0 cette demande.\n[2] M. Brown est quadripl\u00e9gique et utilise un fauteuil roulant pour se d\u00e9placer. Il habite au cur du centre-ville d'Ottawa. Lors de la f\u00eate hivernale d'Ottawa (Bal de Neige) en 2005, il n'a pu monter \u00e0 bord d'un autobus de la STO qui se rendait \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s au parc Jacques-Cartier \u00e0 Gatineau, au Qu\u00e9bec, parce que l'autobus de la STO n'\u00e9tait pas adapt\u00e9 aux fauteuils roulants. Il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue que la STO a commis un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit, acte fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[3] En 2005, la STO et OC Transpo avaient conclu une entente par laquelle ils partageaient la prestation des services d'autobus pour les activit\u00e9s du Bal de Neige. Les activit\u00e9s se tenaient tant \u00e0 Ottawa qu'\u00e0 Gatineau, au Qu\u00e9bec, qui se situe en face d'Ottawa, de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re. OC Transpo affirme que les autobus desservant les lieux o\u00f9 se tenait le Bal de Neige en 2005 \u00e9taient des autobus \u00e0 plancher surbaiss\u00e9 adapt\u00e9s aux personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience. La STO soutient que les autobus qu'elle a utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque n'\u00e9taient pas adapt\u00e9s aux fauteuils roulants. La STO fournissait un service de transport adapt\u00e9, que M. Brown ne pouvait utiliser parce qu'il ne r\u00e9sidait pas au Qu\u00e9bec. Cependant, il pouvait faire appel au service de transport adapt\u00e9 d'OC Transpo.\n[4] Le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour adjoindre des parties. Cependant, il ne faut utiliser ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qu'avec prudence et uniquement lorsque c'est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher la plainte (Smith c. CN, 2005 TCDP 23; Desormeaux c. OC Transpo (d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 l'oral : le 2 octobre 2002 (T701\/0602)); Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone c. Telus Comunications, 2003 TCDP 31).\nL'adjonction d'OC Transpo \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9e\n[5] La STO soutient qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire qu'OC Transpo participe \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure en tant qu'intim\u00e9e pour que soit tranch\u00e9e la plainte. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les services d'autobus \u00e9taient fournis conjointement par les deux organisations, elles doivent toutes deux \u00eatre parties \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure, selon la STO.\n[6] Je ne suis pas d'accord. C'est le service de la STO qui fait l'objet de la plainte en l'esp\u00e8ce, et non l'ensemble de services d'autobus qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis durant le Bal de Neige. M. Brown all\u00e8gue que, contrairement aux autres r\u00e9sidants non handicap\u00e9s d'Ottawa qui voulaient se rendre aux activit\u00e9s ayant lieu du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, il n'a pas pu monter \u00e0 bord d'un autobus de la STO. Il ne critique pas les services d'autobus fournis par OC Transpo durant le Bal de Neige. Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait que les services d'autobus fournis durant le Bal de Neige en 2005 aient \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts conjointement par OC Transpo et la STO ne requiert pas l'adjonction d'OC Transpo \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9e.\n[7] L'intim\u00e9e soutient \u00e9galement qu'OC Transpo devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e en tant que partie parce qu'il incombe \u00e0 OC Transpo de fournir des services d'autobus aux Ontariens handicap\u00e9s. Cette affirmation laisse transpara\u00eetre un moyen de d\u00e9fense contre la plainte et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, peut-\u00eatre, d'appeler des t\u00e9moins d'OC Transpo \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. Cependant, cet argument ne soul\u00e8ve pas la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 d'OC Transpo puisque rien ne laisse croire qu'OC Transpo n'a pas fourni de services de transport \u00e0 M. Brown en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[8] Pour ce qui est de la r\u00e9paration, M. Brown demande les mesures d'accommodement n\u00e9cessaires pour lui permettre d'utiliser les services d'autobus de la STO pour se rendre \u00e0 certains endroits au Qu\u00e9bec, comme les voyageurs non handicap\u00e9s peuvent le faire. Si la plainte est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, la pr\u00e9sence d'OC Transpo en tant que partie n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour fournir de telles mesures de r\u00e9paration.\n[9] Pour ces motifs, la demande de la STO de faire adjoindre OC Transpo en tant qu'intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nL'adjonction du PGQ \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9\n[10] La STO demande que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec soit adjoint en tant qu'intim\u00e9 parce que la plainte de M. Brown pourrait mettre en question la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de transport en commun (la Loi) et la Politique d'admissibilit\u00e9 au transport adapt\u00e9 (la Politique). Selon la STO, la Loi et la Politique exigent que les utilisateurs du transport en commun adapt\u00e9 soient des r\u00e9sidants du Qu\u00e9bec. Puisque M. Brown demande d'\u00eatre desservi peu importe son lieu de r\u00e9sidence, il conteste les exigences de la Loi et de la Politique. Par cons\u00e9quent, la STO soutient que le PGQ doit \u00eatre intim\u00e9 pour d\u00e9fendre la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi et de la Politique.\n[11] Cet argument doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Ni M. Brown ni la Commission n'ont directement ou indirectement contest\u00e9 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi ou de la Politique. La question soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte est de savoir si le fait de n'avoir pas fourni de transport adapt\u00e9 aux fauteuils roulants \u00e0 M. Brown constituait ou non un acte discriminatoire. La STO peut choisir d'invoquer les exigences de r\u00e9sidence pour se d\u00e9fendre, mais la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi et de la Politique n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en cause.\n[12] En outre, m\u00eame si une question constitutionnelle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, les parties n'auraient eu qu'\u00e0 en aviser le PGQ pour qu'il puisse pr\u00e9senter une preuve et des observations, s'il le d\u00e9sire (article 57 de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales). En l'esp\u00e8ce, le PGQ ne consid\u00e8re pas qu'une question constitutionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e et choisit de ne pas participer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] Elizabeth Millar, une experte-conseil travaillant pour le compte de John Wiseman et de l'Association canadienne des surveillants correctionnels, demande au Tribunal de retarder ind\u00e9finiment l'audition de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Wiseman le 30 septembre 2003. Le motif de cette demande est que le plaignant ne dispose pas de ressources financi\u00e8res suffisantes pour d\u00e9frayer les co\u00fbts de l'instance devant le Tribunal.\n[2] Mme Millar a d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 que l'audience devant le Tribunal soit retard\u00e9e ind\u00e9finiment. Les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la demande le 25 juin 2007. Le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 au plaignant jusqu'au 16 novembre 2007 pour d\u00e9cider s'il d\u00e9sirait proc\u00e9der. Le plaignant a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 cette date qu'il d\u00e9sirait proc\u00e9der.\n[3] Le plaignant veut que l'audition de sa plainte soit report\u00e9e jusqu'au r\u00e8glement d'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le groupe CR en 1984 et d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le groupe PA en 2006. Aucune de ces deux plaintes n'a fait l'objet d'une enqu\u00eate de la part de la Commission. En ce qui concerne la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le groupe PA, Mme Millar mentionne que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale proc\u00e8dera \u00e0 une audience en 2009. On ne sait pas exactement quand les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par les groupes CR et PA seront r\u00e9gl\u00e9es ou, advenant qu'elles ne soient pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, quand elles seront renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal.\n[4] De plus, on ne sait pas exactement quelle incidence le r\u00e8glement de ces plaintes aura sur la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Wiseman. Dans sa lettre du 20 juin 2007, M. Hunt, l'avocat qui repr\u00e9sentait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque M. Wiseman, affirme qu'[traduction] [. . .] un r\u00e8glement conclu au nom de dizaines de milliers de personnes pr\u00e9sagerait vraisemblablement le r\u00e8glement \u00e9ventuel de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l'ACE. De m\u00eame, une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, favorable ou non \u00e0 l'AFPC ou \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, permettrait probablement de trancher la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l'ACE [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[5] Le paragraphe 48.9 (1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne mentionne que l'instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. La Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d'instruire la plainte et le Tribunal est tenu de proc\u00e9der le plus rapidement possible.\n[6] En effet, dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, 2008 CF 223, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a formul\u00e9 des commentaires quant au danger pos\u00e9 par les retards. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, en formulant ses observations quant \u00e0 la longueur de l'instance dans cette affaire, la Cour a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit aux paragraphes 264 et 265 :\n\u00c0 mon avis, le Tribunal a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation en vertu du paragraphe 53, et a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation d'accorder aux parties une audience \u00e9quitable. Une audience \u00e9quitable n'est pas un processus permanent. Une audience \u00e9quitable en est une o\u00f9 une partie sait ce qu'on lui reproche et a l'occasion d'y r\u00e9pondre dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable. \u00c0 ce stade, le Tribunal a l'obligation de trancher l'affaire.\nUne audience sans discipline ni \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers retarde la justice et constitue un d\u00e9ni de justice. Justice diff\u00e9r\u00e9e est justice refus\u00e9e. [. . .]\n[7] Il y a deux parties en l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement le droit de conna\u00eetre les all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre lui et le droit de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 celles-ci dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable.\n[8] Le Tribunal comprend le dilemme dans lequel se trouve le plaignant, mais il n'est pas raisonnable ou juste de demander au Tribunal d'ajourner ind\u00e9finiment l'instance en raison d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ne se produiront peut-\u00eatre que dans de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, si jamais ils se produisent.\n[9] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande en ajournement pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9finie de la pr\u00e9sente audience, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Millar au nom de John Wiseman, est rejet\u00e9e.\nJ.

L'ARTICLE 67 DE LA LOI CANADIENNE SUR LES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\n[1] Le plaignant, Perry Dennis, soutient que l'intim\u00e9, le Conseil de bande d'Eskasoni, a refus\u00e9 de l'embaucher comme matelot de pont sur un bateau de p\u00eache parce que le r\u00e9sultat de son test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'emploi \u00e9tait positif. Il soutient que l'intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination envers lui en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience (toxicomanie), au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, dans sa d\u00e9cision et que la politique de d\u00e9pistage de drogues de l'intim\u00e9 est elle-m\u00eame discriminatoire, au sens de l'article 10 de la Loi.\nI. La participation des parties \u00e0 l'audition de la plainte [2] Au d\u00e9part, la Commission avait renvoy\u00e9 cinq autres plaintes, en plus de celle de M. Dennis, au Tribunal. Peu avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience, quatre des plaignants ont r\u00e9gl\u00e9 leurs plaintes avec l'intim\u00e9. La Commission a alors avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle ne participerait pas \u00e0 l'audience. Deux jours apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l'audience, l'autre plaignante restant a aussi r\u00e9gl\u00e9 sa plainte.\n[3] M. Dennis n'\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat \u00e0 l'audition de sa plainte. Le sixi\u00e8me jour de l'audience, apr\u00e8s que M. Dennis a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 sa preuve, il a soudainement, et sans avis au Tribunal ou \u00e0 l'agent du greffe, recueilli ses choses et a quitt\u00e9 la salle d'audience pendant une pause dans la proc\u00e9dure, vers 11 h 45, accompagn\u00e9 de sa conjointe, Mary Lou Gould. Il n'est jamais revenu. J'ai ajourn\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure pour environ deux heures pendant que l'agent du greffe tentait de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner au domicile de M. Dennis. Il n'a eu aucune r\u00e9ponse. J'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les personnes pr\u00e9sentes, y compris \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e8te micmac attitr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'affaire, si M. Dennis avait mentionn\u00e9 pourquoi il avait quitt\u00e9 et pour combien de temps il serait absent. Personne n'a pu me donner de d\u00e9tails. Ils ont simplement vu M. Dennis ramasser ses papiers et quitter sans dire un mot. \u00c0 ce moment, l'intim\u00e9 en \u00e9tait rendu \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 de son interrogatoire principal d'un t\u00e9moin expert. Compte tenu des circonstances, et particuli\u00e8rement du fait que M. Dennis a quitt\u00e9 subitement sans donner de pr\u00e9avis, d'excuse ou d'explication, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de continuer en son absence. Le syst\u00e8me num\u00e9rique de l'enregistrement de la voix du Tribunal a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 enregistrer la proc\u00e9dure et une copie de l'enregistrement a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie aux deux parties.\n[4] Plus tard cet apr\u00e8s-midi l\u00e0, l'agent du greffe a envoy\u00e9 un message par courriel \u00e0 M. Dennis pour l'aviser que l'audience continuerait comme pr\u00e9vu le lendemain. Il a invit\u00e9 M. Dennis \u00e0 communiquer avec lui par courriel ou par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. M. Dennis a r\u00e9pondu par courriel \u00e0 l'agent du greffe ce soir l\u00e0. Il lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait senti [traduction] seul et d\u00e9pass\u00e9 par la proc\u00e9dure. Il a bl\u00e2m\u00e9 en partie la Commission parce qu'elle n'avait pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience et qu'elle l'avait [traduction] abandonn\u00e9 aux loups. Le lendemain matin, M. Dennis a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 l'agent du greffe pour lui demander si Mme Gould pouvait le repr\u00e9senter. Elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'audience depuis le d\u00e9but et elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 t\u00e9moign\u00e9. J'ai accueilli la demande de M. Dennis et Mme Gould s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e cet apr\u00e8s-midi l\u00e0. Elle n'est pas avocate. Elle a contre interrog\u00e9 les t\u00e9moins restants qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner par l'intim\u00e9 et elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations finales pour M. Dennis.\n[5] De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat pendant toute l'audience.\nII. Les faits \u00e0 l'origine de la pr\u00e9sente plainte A. L'accident de voiture de M. Dennis [6] M. Dennis est membre inscrit de la collectivit\u00e9 d'Eskasoni de la Premi\u00e8re nation micmaque, situ\u00e9e \u00e0 environ 40 km au sud de Sydney (Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse). L'intim\u00e9 est le Conseil de bande de la collectivit\u00e9 (la bande).\n[7] M. Dennis a grandi \u00e0 Eskasoni et y a pass\u00e9 la plupart de sa vie. Il a 38 ans. En 1989, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans un accident de voiture grave. Ses blessures comprenaient des fractures au cou. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les fractures lui ont laiss\u00e9 plusieurs probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 chroniques douloureux. De temps en temps, son cou enfle, ce qui restreint les rotations de la t\u00eate et lui cause des douleurs au cou et aux \u00e9paules, ainsi que des maux de t\u00eate s\u00e9v\u00e8res. Ses m\u00e9decins lui ont d'abord prescrit un m\u00e9dicament [traduction] fort pour traiter la douleur, mais il avait l'effet de rendre son visage [traduction] affaiss\u00e9 et triste, m\u00eame s'il se sentait bien. Lorsqu'il a tent\u00e9 de prendre des doses plus faibles, il soutient qu'il [traduction] en est devenu d\u00e9pendant, mais il n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9cision ou explication dans son t\u00e9moignage.\n[8] Vers 1990, M. Dennis a d\u00e9couvert que l'utilisation de la marijuana le relaxait et diminuait sa douleur dans ses \u00e9paules et son cou, sans qu'il n'y ait d'effets secondaires comme ceux mentionn\u00e9s plus haut, qui \u00e9taient caus\u00e9s par les m\u00e9dicaments prescrits par les m\u00e9decins. Il n'utilisait pas la marijuana tous les jours, mais seulement lorsqu'il \u00e9tait pris de [traduction] crises de douleur. Cependant, il y a certains jours o\u00f9, m\u00eame s'il souffrait d'importantes douleurs, il ne prenait pas de marijuana et il [traduction] vivait avec son \u00e9tat et sa douleur.\n[9] \u00c0 un moment en 2004, M. Dennis se souvient avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un m\u00e9decin de la clinique de sant\u00e9 d'Eskasoni de lui prescrire de la marijuana \u00e0 des fins m\u00e9dicales. M. Dennis soutient que bien que le m\u00e9decin n'ait pas contest\u00e9 son utilisation de la marijuana, il a dit \u00e0 M. Dennis qu'il n'avait pas l'autorisation de lui donner une telle prescription. Il semble que M. Dennis n'a pas tent\u00e9 de trouver un autre m\u00e9decin qui avait une telle autorisation. Plut\u00f4t, M. Dennis a continu\u00e9 de se procurer de la marijuana par des moyens qu'il n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s. Le m\u00e9decin n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nB. La p\u00eacherie d'Eskasoni [10] Avant l'an 2000, l'exploitation de p\u00eache de la bande \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s modeste. Elle \u00e9tait g\u00e9r\u00e9e par un d\u00e9partement de la bande qui portait le nom d'Eskasoni Fish & Wildlife Commission (EFWC). La plupart de ses activit\u00e9s portaient sur la recherche et la conservation de la p\u00eache. Il n'y avait qu'environ cinq employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein et entre 15 \u00e0 40 employ\u00e9s occasionnels pendant l'ann\u00e9e.\n[11] Dans deux d\u00e9cisions rendues en 1999 (R. c. Marshall, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 456 et R. c. Marshall, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 533), la Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 les droits issus de trait\u00e9s des Micmacs en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la chasse et \u00e0 la p\u00eache ainsi qu'au commerce des produits de ces activit\u00e9s, afin de gagner un salaire moyen pour eux-m\u00eames et pour leurs familles. \u00c0 la suite de ces d\u00e9cisions, le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans (MPO) f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a conclu des ententes avec les Premi\u00e8res nations pour leur donner les outils qui leur permettraient de d\u00e9velopper leurs propres p\u00eacheries commerciales. La bande a sign\u00e9 une telle entente en 2000 (l'entente Marshall), en vertu de laquelle le MPO fournirait un financement pour l'achat de permis de p\u00eache, de navires et d'autre \u00e9quipement, pour la construction d'immeubles et pour la formation des employ\u00e9s des p\u00eacheries.\n[12] Lorsque l'entente Marshall est entr\u00e9e en vigueur en 2000, peu de membres de la bande poss\u00e9daient les aptitudes requises pour p\u00eacher de fa\u00e7on commerciale. Par cons\u00e9quent, la bande a mis en place des programmes pour former ces personnes \u00e0 titre de matelots de pont, de seconds capitaines et de capitaines certifi\u00e9s. M. Dennis avait travaill\u00e9 de temps en temps comme matelot de pont pour des p\u00eacheurs qui n'\u00e9taient pas autochtones entre 1992 et 2000, mais il n'avait jamais obtenu sa certification. M. Dennis s'est donc inscrit \u00e0 la formation offerte par la bande et il a obtenu son certificat de matelot de pont en 2000.\n[13] Les t\u00e2ches d'un matelot de pont comprennent le nettoyage, l'entretien, la r\u00e9paration et le vidage des filets. Les matelots de pont placent aussi les prises, telles que les crevettes, dans des sacs sp\u00e9ciaux, ils vident et amorcent les pi\u00e8ges et ils nettoient le pont et la cale. Un matelot de pont suit les directives du capitaine qui, en plus de guider le bateau, actionne le vire ou le treuil qui servent \u00e0 soulever les pi\u00e8ges et les filets sur le bateau.\n[14] Pour la plupart des esp\u00e8ces captur\u00e9es par la bande, la saison de p\u00eache dure g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de mars \u00e0 novembre. Afin de distribuer les emplois de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale parmi les matelots de pont qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 Eskasoni, l'EFWC pr\u00e9pare une liste chaque ann\u00e9e sur laquelle les membres de la bande inscrivent leur nom et leur num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Alors qu'un bateau se pr\u00e9pare \u00e0 aller en mer, l'EFWC t\u00e9l\u00e9phone aux matelots de pont dont le nom se trouve sur la liste, en suivant une rotation. Les p\u00eacheurs sont pay\u00e9s en fonction de la taille de la prise et du prix de cette prise au march\u00e9. Ce type d'emploi est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un emploi saisonnier, ce qui permet au p\u00eacheur d'obtenir de l'assurance-emploi pendant la saison morte, si son salaire \u00e0 d\u00e9pass\u00e9 un seuil de base (environ 11 000 $). M. Dennis a inscrit son nom sur la liste et on l'a appel\u00e9 pour travailler en 2001, en 2002 et en 2003. Son salaire de 2003 se trouvait juste sous la barre des 30 000 $. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Dennis et les autres matelots de pont de l'EFWC n'\u00e9taient ni des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein, ni des employ\u00e9s ind\u00e9termin\u00e9s de l'EFWC. Leur emploi \u00e9tait occasionnel. En 2005, l'EFWC a confi\u00e9 la gestion de la p\u00eacherie commerciale \u00e0 une entreprise du nom de Crane Cove Seafoods, qui appartenait en entier \u00e0 la bande. \u00c0 tous \u00e9gards, la bande \u00e9tait toujours en charge de sa p\u00eacherie commerciale.\n[15] D'apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages du chef actuel et de plusieurs conseillers de la bande, au cours des deux premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es d'op\u00e9ration de la p\u00eacherie commerciale, c'est-\u00e0-dire 2001 et 2002, des rapports ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s selon lesquels des p\u00eacheurs allaient en mer alors qu'ils \u00e9taient sous l'influence de drogues ou d'alcool. Par cons\u00e9quent, le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2002, le Conseil de bande a pris une r\u00e9solution selon laquelle les p\u00eacheurs commerciaux devaient subir un d\u00e9pistage de drogues obligatoire. Au cours des mois suivants, la bande a nomm\u00e9 Jim Maloney comme responsable de l'\u00e9laboration d'une politique de d\u00e9pistage de drogues. M. Maloney \u00e9tait membre d'une autre collectivit\u00e9 de Premi\u00e8re nation en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. Par le pass\u00e9, la bande lui avait donn\u00e9 la t\u00e2che d'\u00e9laborer d'autres programmes. \u00c0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2003, la politique propos\u00e9e, qui portait le nom de Eskasoni Fit to Work (Drug and Alcohol) Program Policy ([traduction] la politique de programme Apte au travail d'Eskasoni (Drogues et Alcool)), \u00e9tait pr\u00eate.\n[16] M. Maloney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait tenu un certain nombre de s\u00e9ances d'information pour les p\u00eacheurs commerciaux d'Eskasoni, afin de leur pr\u00e9senter la nouvelle politique. Des affiches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 coll\u00e9es afin d'en faire la publicit\u00e9 et une lettre d'une page, qui r\u00e9sumait la politique, a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'adresse de toute personne qui \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de l'EFWC. La m\u00eame lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9e \u00e0 toutes les personnes qui se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance d'information. La lettre portait le titre de Open Letter to the Community of Eskasoni - Fit to Work (Drug and Alcohol) Program ([traduction] Lettre ouverte \u00e0 la collectivit\u00e9 d'Eskasoni - Programme Apte au travail (Drogues et Alcool)). Elle indiquait que le peuple d'Eskasoni avait cibl\u00e9 l'abus d'alcool et de drogues comme probl\u00e8me s\u00e9rieux qui affectait la vie de tous dans la collectivit\u00e9 et que le chef et le Conseil de bande s'\u00e9taient engag\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me. La lettre expliquait aussi que la politique \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour l'op\u00e9ration de la p\u00eacherie commerciale d'Eskasoni, puisque la p\u00eacherie commerciale \u00e9tait [traduction] reconnue comme l'une des professions les plus dangereuses, ce qui rend la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en milieu de travail essentielle \u00e0 la protection des vies des personnes qui y travaillent.\n[17] La lettre notait aussi que la politique pr\u00e9voyait une s\u00e9rie [traduction] d'\u00e9tapes progressives, li\u00e9es au traitement, pour les gens dont le r\u00e9sultat du d\u00e9pistage \u00e9tait positif, afin que ces gens puissent retourner au travail.\nC. La politique Apte au travail [18] Le 16 septembre 2003, la politique propos\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e officiellement par le Conseil de bande. Sa mise en uvre devait commencer au cours de la saison de p\u00eache de 2004. La politique \u00e9nonce que son objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est de garantir que les employ\u00e9s de l'EFWC [traduction] se conforment aux r\u00e8gles et qu'ils montrent l'exemple \u00e0 la collectivit\u00e9 en travaillant sans \u00eatre sous l'influence de la drogue ou de l'alcool, dans un environnement de travail s\u00e9curitaire o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de drogue ni d'alcool. La politique touche aussi les sous-traitants et les travailleurs \u00e0 contrat. Certains des objectifs pr\u00e9cis mentionn\u00e9s dans la politique comprennent :\n\u00e9viter que les employ\u00e9s se trouvent dans une position o\u00f9 leurs facult\u00e9s sont affaiblies et o\u00f9 leur travail devient un risque pour eux-m\u00eames et pour le bon fonctionnement des installations et de l'\u00e9quipement de l'EFWC;\npr\u00e9venir les accidents et les blessures d\u00e9coulant de l'utilisation de drogues ou de l'alcool;\nencourager et appuyer les travailleurs qui ont un probl\u00e8me de toxicomanie ou d'alcoolisme afin qu'ils atteignent et maintiennent une [traduction] qualit\u00e9 de vie sans alcool et sans drogue.\n[19] La politique oblige les gestionnaires et les employ\u00e9s de l'EFWC \u00e0 lire, \u00e0 comprendre et \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre la politique. Les employ\u00e9s doivent se conformer \u00e0 une norme [traduction] d'aptitude au travail, qui est d\u00e9finie comme la capacit\u00e9 et l'aptitude \u00e0 faire leur travail. Cela comprend le fait qu'ils ne doivent pas \u00eatre sous l'influence de l'alcool, de drogues illicites, de m\u00e9dicaments ou de substances qui peuvent affecter leur rendement. On s'attend \u00e0 ce que les employ\u00e9s demandent de l'aide et suivent un traitement appropri\u00e9 s'ils croient qu'ils ont ou qu'ils d\u00e9veloppent un probl\u00e8me de toxicomanie.\n[20] La politique pr\u00e9voit que tous les employ\u00e9s de l'EFWC doivent se soumettre \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues et d'alcool avant de pouvoir \u00eatre embauch\u00e9s. Toute offre d'emploi est conditionnelle au r\u00e9sultat de ce test de d\u00e9pistage. De plus, il peut y avoir des tests surpris, \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion de l'employeur, tout au long de l'ann\u00e9e, sans pr\u00e9avis. Il peut aussi y avoir des tests de d\u00e9pistage s'il y a eu un [traduction] accident important qui cause, ou qui aurait pu causer, la mort, des blessures, la perte ou la destruction d'\u00e9quipement. En outre, si les gestionnaires ont de bonnes raisons de croire que les actions, l'apparence ou le comportement d'un employ\u00e9, alors qu'il se trouve au travail, peuvent indiquer qu'il a consomm\u00e9 de la drogue ou de l'alcool, ils peuvent exiger que l'employ\u00e9 se soumette \u00e0 un test, mais cette d\u00e9cision doit \u00eatre prise avec l'approbation d'une deuxi\u00e8me personne, si possible.\n[21] Les substances qui sont recherch\u00e9es dans le test de d\u00e9pistage sont :\ndans la cat\u00e9gorie des drogues - les cannabino\u00efdes (marijuana, hachisch, de l'huile de cannabis), les stimulants (la coca\u00efne, les opiac\u00e9s, les amph\u00e9tamines) et les anesth\u00e9siques de v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire (phencyclidine (PCP));\ndans la cat\u00e9gorie de l'alcool - l'alcool de bouche, l'alcool \u00e9thylique ou d'autres alcools de faible poids mol\u00e9culaire, y compris le m\u00e9thanol ou l'alcool isopropylique.\nLa politique pr\u00e9cise comment les tests de d\u00e9pistage se d\u00e9rouleront afin de d\u00e9terminer si des drogues ou de l'alcool se trouvent en quantit\u00e9s d\u00e9passant certains niveaux de concentration (qui sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans un tableau). Un r\u00e9sultat positif (c'est-\u00e0-dire qui d\u00e9passe le seuil d'inclusion) est soumis \u00e0 un deuxi\u00e8me test plus avanc\u00e9 afin d'obtenir confirmation. Les tests de confirmation qui sont positifs sont alors envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 un agent d'examen m\u00e9dical pour une autre \u00e9valuation et pour [traduction] garantir qu'on ne donne pas \u00e0 la personne un faux r\u00e9sultat positif en laboratoire.\n[22] Lorsque l'\u00e9valuation de l'agent d'examen m\u00e9dical confirme le premier r\u00e9sultat et \u00e9limine la possibilit\u00e9 d'un faux r\u00e9sultat positif, une s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9valuations et d'options de traitement sont offertes en vertu de la politique. S'il s'agit de la premi\u00e8re fois o\u00f9 l'employ\u00e9 a un r\u00e9sultat positif, on lui recommandera d'obtenir une \u00e9valuation ou un traitement pour consommation de drogue ou d'alcool, mais il s'agit d'une option tout \u00e0 fait volontaire. Les num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de la Native Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselling Association (NADACA) et de la tente micmaque, o\u00f9 l'on peut obtenir des conseils au sujet de la toxicomanie, se trouvent dans la politique. Toute personne qui veut poser sa candidature ou retourner au travail doit se soumettre \u00e0 un autre test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues de [traduction] retour au travail, et obtenir un r\u00e9sultat n\u00e9gatif, avant de pouvoir obtenir un emploi.\n[23] Si la personne obtient un deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9sultat positif, elle devra \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e par un conseiller en toxicomanie \u00e0 la NADACA, mais le traitement sera volontaire, et non obligatoire. La personne reste inapte \u00e0 travailler. Apr\u00e8s un troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9sultat positif, l'\u00e9valuation et le traitement deviennent obligatoires. La personne doit terminer le traitement avant de pouvoir \u00eatre r\u00e9embauch\u00e9e, et cette embauche est conditionnelle aux conclusions et aux recommandations positives du conseiller en toxicomanie ou de l'\u00e9tablissement de traitement.\n[24] Apr\u00e8s un quatri\u00e8me r\u00e9sultat positif, la personne sera mise \u00e0 pied et ne pourra pas pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau sa candidature pendant un an, jusqu'\u00e0 [traduction] preuve de sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Thomas Johnston, le directeur ex\u00e9cutif de l'EFWC, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'EFWC interpr\u00e9tait cette p\u00e9riode comme n'\u00e9tant pas exactement douze mois, mais plut\u00f4t comme une p\u00e9riode qui allait jusqu'\u00e0 la prochaine saison de p\u00eache. Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame si certains p\u00eacheurs ne r\u00e9ussissaient pas le quatri\u00e8me test de d\u00e9pistage en octobre, ils pouvaient n\u00e9anmoins se pr\u00e9senter au processus de d\u00e9pistage du printemps suivant, avec les autres p\u00eacheurs.\n[25] La politique pr\u00e9cise que l'EFWC d\u00e9fraierait les co\u00fbts du premier test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues d'une personne dont le r\u00e9sultat est positif, mais les co\u00fbts de tout autre \u00e9valuation ou traitement ne seront pas couverts par l'EFWC. Tous les r\u00e9sultats de tests sont confidentiels et ne doivent pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s, sauf au gestionnaire de l'EFWC appropri\u00e9. La communication et l'envoi des r\u00e9sultats positifs des tests de d\u00e9pistage sont faits par code, plut\u00f4t que par nom de la personne, et la gestion de l'EFWC doit garder dans un endroit s\u00e9curitaire la liste qui pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 quels noms correspondent les codes.\n[26] Toute personne qui enfreint la politique pendant qu'elle est [traduction] sur appel ou pendant qu'elle travaille sur les lieux, sur les bateaux ou avec de l'\u00e9quipement qui appartient \u00e0 l'EFWC, est imm\u00e9diatement, \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion de l'EFWC, renvoy\u00e9e, suspendue de son travail sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, escort\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur des navires ou des lieux appartenant \u00e0 l'EFWC, rapport\u00e9e \u00e0 la police lorsqu'il y a pr\u00e9sence de drogues ill\u00e9gales ou plac\u00e9e au statut de [traduction] retour au travail. Dans ce dernier cas, la personne pourra retourner au travail apr\u00e8s avoir subi un autre examen, comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ci-dessus.\nD. Le d\u00e9pistage de 2004 [27] M. Maloney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pour la saison de p\u00eache de 2004, la bande a embauch\u00e9 une firme externe, East Coast Mobile Medical Inc. (East Coast), pour effectuer les tests de d\u00e9pistage de drogues sur place \u00e0 Eskasoni en l'espace d'une journ\u00e9e. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait envoy\u00e9 des avis \u00e0 tous les p\u00eacheurs pour leur pr\u00e9ciser qu'ils devaient s'inscrire en vertu du programme Apte au travail au plus tard le 8 mars 2004, sur une liste qui se trouvait au bureau de l'EFWC. Ces avis ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s sur le poste de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision communautaire local.\n[28] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Dennis a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais re\u00e7u cet avis et qu'il n'a eu connaissance de la tenue du test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues que quelques jours avant qu'il ait lieu, le 14 mai 2004. La preuve met en doute cette d\u00e9claration. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait en mer en janvier et en f\u00e9vrier, au moment o\u00f9 les avis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9s, m\u00eame si la preuve attestait que les \u00e9quipages ne quittaient le port habituellement que pour trois jours \u00e0 la fois. De plus, la feuille d'enregistrement pour le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve, contredit la d\u00e9claration de M. Dennis selon laquelle il n'\u00e9tait pas au courant. Son nom appara\u00eet sur la liste, ainsi que son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, son num\u00e9ro de membre de la bande et une note indiquant [traduction] apr\u00e8s 17 h. M. Maloney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il se souvenait que M. Dennis lui ait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour s'inscrire et pour mentionner qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait se soumettre au test de d\u00e9pistage apr\u00e8s 17 h. M. Maloney a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande, puisque l'EFWC essayait d'\u00eatre aussi souple que possible afin de garantir que chaque p\u00eacheur subirait le test de d\u00e9pistage.\n[29] En outre, la preuve d\u00e9montre qu'en mars 2004, apr\u00e8s que l'EFWC ait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 inscrire des personnes pour le test de d\u00e9pistage, plusieurs p\u00eacheurs ont form\u00e9 un groupe qui s'opposait \u00e0 l'imposition de la politique Apte au travail. M. Dennis a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 organiser ce groupe et son nom appara\u00eet \u00e0 titre de partisan dans une lettre ouverte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e avant le 15 mars 2004. La lettre invite tous les r\u00e9sidents d'Eskasoni \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une r\u00e9union organis\u00e9e par le groupe qui portait sur la politique Apte au travail. La r\u00e9union a eu lieu le 22 mars 2004 et le proc\u00e8s-verbal d\u00e9montre que M. Dennis \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne semble pas cr\u00e9dible que M. Dennis d\u00e9clare qu'il n'a su que quelques jours avant la tenue du test de d\u00e9pistage que celui-ci aurait lieu.\n[30] M. Dennis n'approuvait pas la politique. Il \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il s'agissait d'une attaque du chef et du Conseil de bande contre certains membres de la bande, pour les emp\u00eacher de gagner un bon salaire. Apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre soumis au test de d\u00e9pistage le 14 mai 2004 (analyse d'urine et alcootest), il a communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Johnston, qui \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque \u00e9tait directeur des op\u00e9rations \u00e0 l'EFWC, et il a appris qu'il avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 l'analyse d'urine parce qu'on y d\u00e9cel\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence de cannabis. M. Dennis a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en interrogatoire principal qu'on ne lui a pas dit qu'il pouvait subir un autre test cette saison l\u00e0. Il soutient que M. Johnston lui a dit qu'on ne lui donnerait pas de travail cet \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 et qu'il ne pouvait se pr\u00e9senter pour un autre test que l'ann\u00e9e suivante, \u00e0 ses propres frais.\n[31] La d\u00e9claration de M. Dennis \u00e0 ce sujet est contraire \u00e0 la preuve de M. Maloney et au dossier d'entreprise d'East Coast. M. Maloney se souvient avoir discut\u00e9 au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec M. Dennis apr\u00e8s qu'il ait \u00e9chou\u00e9 le premier test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'emploi. Il se souvient que M. Dennis a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait h\u00e2te de se soumettre \u00e0 un autre test et qu'il esp\u00e9rait pouvoir retourner au travail cet \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0.\n[32] M. Maloney a alors entrepris de prendre un nouveau rendez-vous pour le test de d\u00e9pistage de M. Dennis, qui devait avoir lieu \u00e0 l'installation d'East Coast \u00e0 North Sydney (Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse). M. Maloney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait avis\u00e9 M. Dennis par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone qu'un rendez-vous avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pris pour le 18 juin 2004. M. Dennis ne s'est jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 son rendez-vous. M. Maloney a alors pris un deuxi\u00e8me rendez-vous pour M. Dennis, le 6 ao\u00fbt 2004. M. Maloney se souvient avoir averti M. Dennis qu'il \u00e9tait important qu'il se pr\u00e9sente, puisque East Coast avait factur\u00e9 la bande pour le premier rendez-vous, m\u00eame si M. Dennis ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Les dossiers d'East Coast d\u00e9montent que M. Dennis avait un rendez-vous pour ces deux dates, mais qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune d'elles.\n[33] \u00c0 mon avis, cette preuve est convaincante, alors que je ne suis pas convaincu par la d\u00e9claration de M. Dennis selon laquelle on lui a dit de revenir l'ann\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s pour subir un deuxi\u00e8me test. Je note qu'une telle r\u00e9ponse ne correspond pas \u00e0 la politique, qui pr\u00e9cise qu'une personne peut se soumettre \u00e0 un nouveau test jusqu'\u00e0 quatre fois. Si la personne \u00e9choue le quatri\u00e8me test, elle peut tout de m\u00eame se soumettre au test une fois de plus l'ann\u00e9e suivante. Il s'agit de la seule limite de temps mentionn\u00e9e dans la politique. Il n'existe aucune limite de temps attach\u00e9e au deuxi\u00e8me test. Pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment, d\u00e8s qu'une personne se sent pr\u00eate \u00e0 se resoumettre au test, elle peut le faire. Le processus complet de test et de tests subs\u00e9quents, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la politique, vise \u00e0 \u00eatre termin\u00e9 avant la fin de la saison annuelle de p\u00eache, conform\u00e9ment au processus de r\u00e9embauche qui a lieu au d\u00e9but de chaque saison de p\u00eache. Par cons\u00e9quent, tous les p\u00eacheurs doivent se soumettre \u00e0 un test chaque ann\u00e9e, m\u00eame si leur r\u00e9sultat \u00e9tait n\u00e9gatif lors de la saison pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. De plus, la politique pr\u00e9voit que m\u00eame dans les pires cas, lorsqu'une personne \u00e9choue le test quatre fois, elle n'est inapte \u00e0 l'emploi que jusqu'\u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e suivante.\n[34] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Dennis a soulign\u00e9 qu'East Coast ne venait \u00e0 Eskasoni qu'une fois par ann\u00e9e pour faire subir le test de d\u00e9pistage \u00e0 tous les p\u00eacheurs. Il s'agit possiblement de la source du malentendu au sujet de la date \u00e0 laquelle il pouvait se soumettre \u00e0 nouveau au test. La preuve laisse entendre qu'il ait pu refuser de se rendre ailleurs pour se soumettre au test. Cependant, il n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9raisonnable que la bande demande \u00e0 une personne qui souhaite obtenir un emploi, mais qui a \u00e9chou\u00e9 le premier test sur place, de se rendre au bureau d'East Coast \u00e0 North Sydney (\u00e0 environ une heure en voiture d'Eskasoni) pour qu'elle se soumettre \u00e0 un nouveau test, plut\u00f4t que de payer East Coast pour que la compagnie ram\u00e8ne son \u00e9quipement \u00e0 Eskasoni, simplement pour faire subir le test \u00e0 une seule personne.\n[35] Bien que M. Dennis ne se soit pas rendu \u00e0 l'installation d'East Coast \u00e0 North Sydney pour subir le test, il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Centre de sant\u00e9 communautaire d'Eskasoni le 23 juin 2004, o\u00f9 un m\u00e9decin l'a examin\u00e9. Le m\u00e9decin a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la main une note de cinq lignes pour M. Dennis adress\u00e9e [traduction] \u00e0 qui de droit, dans laquelle il d\u00e9clarait que, en fonction de son examen, M. Dennis semblait [traduction] Apte au travail. Il n'a inscrit aucun autre commentaire et, en particulier, il n'y a aucune mention d'un quelconque test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues ou d'alcool que le m\u00e9decin aurait effectu\u00e9\n[36] Comme M. Dennis ne s'est pas soumis \u00e0 un autre test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues en 2004, il n'a pas pu travailler comme p\u00eacheur pour l'EFWC cette ann\u00e9e l\u00e0.\n[37] Apr\u00e8s avoir appris qu'il avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues, M. Dennis a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une [traduction] lettre de grief devant la bande, dans laquelle il se plaignait de [traduction] tests injustes de la part de l'EFWC. Dans sa lettre, il faisait allusion \u00e0 une manifestation que les p\u00eacheurs membres du groupe de protestation avaient tenue \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur des bureaux de l'EFWC pendant plusieurs jours en mai 2004. Suppos\u00e9ment, le chef les avait rencontr\u00e9s et avait accept\u00e9 de permettre aux p\u00eacheurs de travailler, m\u00eame si les r\u00e9sultats de leur test \u00e9taient positifs. Cependant, plusieurs jours apr\u00e8s la suppos\u00e9e entente, le Conseil de bande s'est r\u00e9uni et a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 que la politique serait en vigueur. M. Dennis mentionne dans son grief la politique de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne sur les tests de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool et de drogues, qu'il avait cens\u00e9ment examin\u00e9e. Il a soutenu que la politique de la Commission [traduction] indique clairement qu'on a enfreint ses droits.\n[38] Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que M. Dennis ne mentionne pas dans sa lettre son besoin d'utiliser la marijuana comme m\u00e9dicament antidouleur pour son cou et ses \u00e9paules. Il a mentionn\u00e9 avoir souffert de maux de t\u00eate, de fatigue, de d\u00e9pression, d'insomnie et de perte d'app\u00e9tit, mais il a attribu\u00e9 ces probl\u00e8mes aux [traduction] divers stresseurs qu'il vivait en raison de l'application de la politique, qui a caus\u00e9 son [traduction] incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler. M. Dennis a annex\u00e9 la note du m\u00e9decin, susmentionn\u00e9e, dans sa lettre de grief.\n[39] Le 7 juillet 2004, M. Dennis a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, dans laquelle il d\u00e9clarait qu'on lui avait refus\u00e9 un emploi [traduction] en raison du fait [qu'il] souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience physique et [qu'il prend] la drogue marijuana. Cependant, dans son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 conjointement avec la Commission, il ne fait aucune mention d'une d\u00e9ficience physique; il soutient en fait que la bande a fait preuve de discrimination envers lui, fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience ou sur la perception d'une d\u00e9ficience, qu'il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e \u00eatre la d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue. Il n'a fait aucune all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur toute d\u00e9ficience li\u00e9e \u00e0 ses blessures au dos et au cou. Il a expos\u00e9 son affaire conform\u00e9ment aux all\u00e9gations qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. La bande, quant \u00e0 elle, \u00e9tait d'avis que la d\u00e9ficience en question \u00e9tait la d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue et elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son dossier en cons\u00e9quence. Bien que la plainte comme telle est un peu ambigu\u00eb dans la description de la suppos\u00e9e discrimination, \u00e0 mon avis, il serait injuste envers la bande de traiter cette affaire comme \u00e9tant une affaire autre qu'une plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue, compte tenu de la fa\u00e7on dont l'affaire s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e.\nE. Le d\u00e9pistage de 2005-2006 [40] Le d\u00e9pistage de drogues a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 pour tous les p\u00eacheurs \u00e0 nouveau en 2005 et M. Dennis s'est soumis au test de d\u00e9pistage le 22 avril 2005. Il a eu un r\u00e9sultat positif pour les cannabino\u00efdes. En contre-interrogatoire, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Dennis s'il avait demand\u00e9 de subir un autre test en 2005. Il ne s'en souvenait pas, mais il a dit qu'il [traduction] devait avoir fait quelque chose. Aucune preuve au dossier n'indique qu'il a demand\u00e9 un autre test en 2005.\n[41] Alors que la saison de p\u00eache de 2006 approchait, M. Dennis a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prendre des mesures afin de garantir qu'il pouvait r\u00e9ussir le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues. Il a compl\u00e8tement arr\u00eat\u00e9 l'utilisation de marijuana. Cependant, il est devenu tr\u00e8s d\u00e9prim\u00e9 en raison de l'angoisse qu'il ressentait du fait qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de gagner sa vie et de s'occuper du bien-\u00eatre de sa famille. Un soir, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 boire de l'alcool, m\u00eame s'il \u00e9tait sobre depuis sept ans. Il a bu de fa\u00e7on excessive, \u00e0 un point tel que la GRC a d\u00fb intervenir et l'amener au d\u00e9tachement, o\u00f9 il a pass\u00e9 la nuit.\n[42] Heureusement pour M. Dennis, un ancien de la collectivit\u00e9 a eu vent de ses troubles et s'est interpos\u00e9 pour aider M. Dennis en l'amenant \u00e0 une suerie. On a administr\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Dennis des m\u00e9thodes de gu\u00e9rison traditionnelles pour l'aider avec sa douleur, y compris l'application de gras d'ours. M. Dennis a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ces m\u00e9thodes de gu\u00e9rison l'ont aid\u00e9 \u00e0 mieux endurer sa douleur.\n[43] Le 24 mars 2006, M. Dennis s'est soumis \u00e0 nouveau au test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues. Cette fois, les r\u00e9sultats \u00e9taient n\u00e9gatifs. Son nom a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la liste des p\u00eacheurs disponibles et il a travaill\u00e9 durant cette saison.\n[44] En 2007, M. Dennis ne s'est pas inscrit pour subir le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues de l'EFWC. Il semblerait que M. Dennis croyait, avec erreur, qu'il n'avait pas besoin de s'inscrire officiellement pour les tests de 2007 puisqu'il avait obtenu un r\u00e9sultat n\u00e9gatif l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Il croyait qu'il pouvait simplement se pr\u00e9senter le jour du test de d\u00e9pistage et donner son \u00e9chantillon. Il avait tort. M. Dennis (et tous les p\u00eacheurs) doivent s'inscrire officiellement chaque ann\u00e9e pour subir le test de d\u00e9pistage. Comme M. Dennis ne s'\u00e9tait pas inscrit, il n'avait pas le droit de se pr\u00e9senter pour le test de d\u00e9pistage en 2007.\n[45] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la saison de p\u00eache de 2008, l'audience s'est termin\u00e9e alors que la saison de p\u00eache allait commencer. Le gestionnaire de la p\u00eacherie de l'EFWC a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Dennis ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour son rendez-vous pour le d\u00e9pistage de drogues pr\u00e9vu le 28 mars 2008. La preuve dont je suis saisi au sujet de cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement et de la saison 2008 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est, cependant, insuffisante pour que je puisse tirer de conclusion.\nIII. LES PRINCIPES JURIDIQUES APPLICABLES EN L'ESP\u00c8CE [46] La plainte de M. Dennis est soulev\u00e9e en vertu des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L'article 7 pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu. L'article 10 pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait, pour l'employeur, de fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite.\n[47] L'article 3 pr\u00e9voit que la d\u00e9ficience fait partie des motifs de distinction illicite. L'article 25 de la Loi pr\u00e9cise que le terme d\u00e9ficience comprend la d\u00e9pendance, pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, envers l'alcool ou la drogue.\n[48] Le premier fardeau revient au plaignant, qui doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination (Comm. ont. des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28 (O'Malley)). La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[49] Lorsque le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, il revient \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication raisonnable pour justifier la pratique qui autrement serait discriminatoire (Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au paragraphe 18). Le comportement d'un employeur ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 discriminatoire s'il peut \u00e9tablir que le refus, l'exclusion, l'expulsion, la suspension, la restriction, la condition ou la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence par rapport \u00e0 tout emploi \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi). Pour qu'une pratique soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que l'accommodement des besoins de l'individu ou du groupe d'individus affect\u00e9s imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 la personne qui devrait accommoder ces besoins, par rapport \u00e0 la sant\u00e9, \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et aux co\u00fbts (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\nIV. La plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 7 A. Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie fond\u00e9e sur l'article 7? (i) M. Dennis \u00e9tait il d\u00e9ficient (c'est-\u00e0-dire toxicomane) au sens de la Loi? [50] Je conclus que M. Dennis n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9ficient au sens de la Loi. La preuve \u00e9tablit indiscutablement que M. Dennis consommait de la marijuana, mais elle n'est pas suffisante pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qu'il avait une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue.\n[51] M. Dennis a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il souffre de douleurs chroniques, depuis l'accident de voiture qu'il a subi en 1988. Plusieurs documents qui datent de 1988 et 1989 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Ces documents pr\u00e9cisaient certains des traitements que M. Dennis a re\u00e7us apr\u00e8s son accident. Sa conjointe a confirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage les signes externes de douleur que M. Dennis montre encore aujourd'hui. \u00c0 mon avis, il n'y a aucune raison de douter des d\u00e9clarations de M. Dennis au sujet de la douleur physique qu'il ressent.\n[52] De fa\u00e7on plus importante, cependant, aucune preuve ne m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e selon laquelle il avait une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la marijuana lorsqu'il a \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues en 2004 et lorsqu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte. Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e doit \u00eatre suffisante pour porter sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites. M. Dennis all\u00e8gue qu'il est dependent \u00e0 la drogue et qu'il est donc d\u00e9ficient. Cependant, je conclus que cette preuve ne fait que d\u00e9montrer qu'il consomme cette drogue, et non qu'il en est d\u00e9pendant. La d\u00e9finition du New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary pour le mot d\u00e9pendant, dans un contexte pertinent quant \u00e0 l'article 25 de la Loi, est la suivante :\nResting entirely on someone or something for maintenance, support, or other requirement; obliged to use something; unable to do without someone or something, especially a drug; maintained at another's cost.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[traduction]\nSe fier enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 quelqu'un ou \u00e0 quelque chose pour subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins, pour obtenir un soutien, ou pour tout autre besoin; \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 d'utiliser quelque chose; \u00eatre incapable de fonctionner sans quelqu'un ou quelque chose, particuli\u00e8rement une drogue; subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins aux frais de quelqu'un d'autre.\nLa version fran\u00e7aise de l'article 25 utilise l'expression la d\u00e9pendance [...] envers l'alcool ou la drogue. Le Petit Robert de la langue fran\u00e7aise, 2006 d\u00e9finit la d\u00e9pendance, dans ce contexte, comme :\n\u00c9tat r\u00e9sultant de la consommation r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e d'une substance toxique, qui se caract\u00e9rise par le besoin de continuer la prise et d'augmenter les doses.\n[53] Ces deux d\u00e9finitions, \u00e0 mon avis, capturent le sens du terme tel qu'il est utilis\u00e9 dans l'article 25. En appliquant ces d\u00e9finitions \u00e0 l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que la preuve est insuffisante pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie que M. Dennis \u00e9tait d\u00e9pendant \u00e0 la marijuana (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de fonctionner sans cette drogue, ou subsidiairement, qu'il \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat dans lequel il devait continuer la prise et augmenter les doses de cette drogue).\n[54] Il n'a appel\u00e9 aucun m\u00e9decin (m\u00eame le m\u00e9decin du Centre communautaire de sant\u00e9 d'Eskasoni, qu'il a vu le 23 juin 2004) \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner du fait qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9pendant \u00e0 la marijuana, et il n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun rapport d'expert \u00e0 ce sujet. Aucun t\u00e9moin n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 pour confirmer l'\u00e9tendue de sa consommation de marijuana, m\u00eame si M. Dennis a d'abord d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son interrogatoire principal que [traduction] tout le monde dans la collectivit\u00e9 \u00e9tait au courant de son [traduction] \u00e9tat et de son [traduction] habitude. Cependant, en contre-interrogatoire, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la majorit\u00e9 des gens dans la collectivit\u00e9 ne savait pas qu'il fumait de la marijuana. Il s'est plaint du fait qu'en refusant de l'embaucher, la bande avait effectivement rendu public le fait qu'il avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues et d'alcool, et il a vu cela comme un manquement \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e. Tout compte fait, il me semble que sa consommation de marijuana, en fait, n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9vidente.\n[55] M. Dennis a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il utilisait la marijuana comme m\u00e9dicament antidouleur, qu'il en consommait en quantit\u00e9s vari\u00e9es et qu'il tentait [traduction] d'\u00e9tirer les doses autant que possible. Le fait que la politique le for\u00e7ait \u00e0 changer son mode de vie et \u00e0 utiliser d'autres moyens de composer avec sa douleur au cou et aux \u00e9paules le d\u00e9rangeait. Il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait utiliser la marijuana plut\u00f4t que d'autres m\u00e9dicaments antidouleur, que ses m\u00e9decins lui avaient prescrits par le pass\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il se demandait pourquoi la bande exigeait qu'il abandonne sa consommation de marijuana. Cependant, je note \u00e0 nouveau qu'il n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 de d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue dans la lettre de grief qu'il a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la bande avant de d\u00e9poser la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[56] M. Dennis a confirm\u00e9 qu'en utilisant les m\u00e9thodes traditionnelles de gu\u00e9rison, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable d'accepter la douleur caus\u00e9e par les blessures qu'il avait subies dans l'accident de voiture de 1988 et de composer avec celle-ci. Il a donc cess\u00e9 d'utiliser la marijuana pour composer avec la douleur et il a ainsi r\u00e9ussi le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'emploi de l'EFWC en 2006. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas ressenti de sympt\u00f4mes de manque apr\u00e8s avoir arr\u00eat\u00e9 de consommer de la marijuana. Rien n'indiquait dans son t\u00e9moignage ou dans la preuve que les m\u00e9thodes de gu\u00e9rison traditionnelles qu'il avait re\u00e7ues \u00e0 la suerie avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es afin de traiter sa d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue ou \u00e0 l'alcool. Il ne s'agissait pas d'un traitement de r\u00e9adaptation pour les alcooliques ou les toxicomanes.\n[57] Pour d\u00e9terminer si M. Dennis \u00e9tait d\u00e9ficient en raison d'une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue, je tiens compte du fait que la notion de d\u00e9ficience ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on restreinte. La d\u00e9ficience peut exister m\u00eame s'il n'y a aucune preuve de limite physique ou aucune pr\u00e9sence de malaise (Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Ville de Montr\u00e9al, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665, au paragraphe 76). N\u00e9anmoins, dans les circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce, la preuve au sujet de la consommation de drogues de M. Dennis n'appuie pas sa d\u00e9claration selon laquelle il avait une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue. (La question de savoir si la bande a per\u00e7u M. Dennis comme une personne d\u00e9ficiente sera trait\u00e9e dans la prochaine section de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision).\n[58] La d\u00e9claration de M. Dennis selon laquelle il consommait de la marijuana r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite et les r\u00e9sultats des tests de d\u00e9pistage de drogues pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'emploi de 2004 et 2005 n'emp\u00eachent pas une telle conclusion. Cependant, la consommation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de marijuana ne constitue pas n\u00e9cessairement un usage fr\u00e9quent. Comme j'expliquerai plus tard dans la d\u00e9cision, des preuves d'expert ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es qui d\u00e9montraient que m\u00eame une seule consommation de marijuana serait d\u00e9tect\u00e9e dans un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues, jusqu'\u00e0 dix jours apr\u00e8s la consommation. Des consommations plus fr\u00e9quentes peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9tect\u00e9es m\u00eame un ou deux mois plus tard.\n[59] Je ne suis pas convaincu que la simple pr\u00e9sence de drogue dans son syst\u00e8me, ni m\u00eame le reste de la preuve au sujet de sa consommation de marijuana, \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie qu'il avait une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue au sens de la Loi (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il ne pouvait pas fonctionner sans drogue ou qu'il avait le besoin de continuer la prise et d'augmenter les doses).\n(ii) La bande a-t-elle per\u00e7u M. Dennis comme \u00e9tant d\u00e9pendant \u00e0 la drogue? [60] Cependant, comme la jurisprudence dans des cas semblables nous le d\u00e9montre, le fait qu'un tribunal ne soit pas persuad\u00e9 qu'un plaignant ait une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience, n'est pas fatal \u00e0 la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de ce plaignant (voir Milazzo c. Autocar Connaisseur Inc., 2003 TCDP 37, aux paragraphes 82 \u00e0 88, Alberta (H.R.C.C.) c. Kellogg Brown and Root (Canada) Company, 2007 ABCA 426, aux paragraphes 29 et 30, demande de pourvoi \u00e0 la CSC rejet\u00e9e le 29 mai 2008 (dossier no 32505)). L'interdiction contre la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendue aux affaires dans lesquelles un employeur refuse d'employer un individu en raison d'une perception que l'individu a une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 l'alcool ou la drogue.\n[61] On ne m'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve qui laisse entendre que la bande a r\u00e9ellement per\u00e7u M. Dennis comme \u00e9tant d\u00e9pendant \u00e0 la drogue. M. Dennis n'a certainement pas appel\u00e9 de t\u00e9moins ou produit de document qui affirmait l'existence d'une telle opinion. Rien dans la preuve dont je suis saisi n'indique que des questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es ou que des enqu\u00eates ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprises par la bande afin de d\u00e9terminer si M. Dennis avait une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue (voir Milazzo, au paragraphe 90). En fait, M. Maloney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la bande n'a jamais suppos\u00e9 qu'un individu, dont le r\u00e9sultat est positif au premier test (comme M. Dennis), avait une d\u00e9pendance, comme le d\u00e9montre le fait qu'on n'a pas exig\u00e9 que M. Dennis et d'autres personnes comme lui subissent une \u00e9valuation ou un traitement pour la d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue ou \u00e0 l'alcool avant qu'ils puissent se soumettre au test pour une deuxi\u00e8me fois.\n[62] Aucun des employ\u00e9s de la bande qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience n'ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils savaient que M. Dennis consommait de la marijuana. M. Dennis a soutenu dans son propre t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 au travail, dans les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, alors qu'il \u00e9tait sous l'influence de la marijuana. Par cons\u00e9quent, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 ment, l'EFWC et la bande n'avaient pu avoir aucun signe externe de sa consommation de marijuana. L'EFWC et la bande avaient encore moins d'indications qui pouvaient les porter \u00e0 percevoir que M. Dennis avait une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue.\n[63] Comme le Tribunal l'a conclu dans Milazzo, au paragraphe 92, afin de pouvoir se pr\u00e9valoir des protections de la Loi, un plaignant doit d\u00e9montrer l'intervention d'un ou de plusieurs motifs de distinction illicite \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi. Comme M. Dennis n'a pas \u00e9tabli, m\u00eame en preuve prima facie, qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9ficient en raison d'une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue ou que la bande le percevait comme \u00e9tant d\u00e9ficient, il n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination et, par cons\u00e9quent, sa plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 7 est rejet\u00e9e.\nV. La plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10 [64] Contrairement aux plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l'article 7, qui porte sur les actions d'un employeur qui affecte des individus pr\u00e9cis, nomm\u00e9s, l'article 10 traite des effets discriminatoires que les politiques ou les pratiques d'un employeur pourraient avoir ou auraient tendance \u00e0 avoir sur un individu ou un groupe d'individus (Milazzo, au paragraphe 94). La question n'est donc pas uniquement centr\u00e9e sur la situation de M. Dennis.\nA. Une preuve prima facie a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au sens de l'article 10? [65] Une preuve d\u00e9taill\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sujet du probl\u00e8me r\u00e9pandu de consommation de drogues et d'alcool \u00e0 Eskasoni. Je note que l'un des objectifs que la bande a d\u00e9clar\u00e9s lors de l'adoption de la politique \u00e9tait d'encourager et d'appuyer les personnes toxicomanes \u00e0 \u00e9tablir et \u00e0 garder une [traduction] qualit\u00e9 de vie sans drogue et sans alcool. Le nombre de r\u00e9sidents d'Eskasoni qui s'inscrivent pour devenir p\u00eacheurs a augment\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on importante au cours des ans. Comme la proportion de la population d'Eskasoni qui rejoint les rangs des p\u00eacheurs commerciaux augmente, il devient plus probable que les personnes qui vivent avec un abus d'alcool ou d'autres drogues, et qui ont donc une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue ou \u00e0 l'alcool (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'ils ont une d\u00e9ficience au sens de l'article 25), voudront obtenir un tel travail, mais ils \u00e9choueront le test de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool et de drogues. Ceux qui \u00e9chouent le test seront, au moins temporairement, priv\u00e9s de la possibilit\u00e9 de travailler comme p\u00eacheurs. Comme c'\u00e9tait le cas dans Milazzo, \u00e0 mon avis, la politique dans l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce affectera donc in\u00e9vitablement les personnes qui souffrent de d\u00e9ficiences li\u00e9es \u00e0 la toxicomanie.\n[66] Une politique de d\u00e9pistage de drogues qui a pour effet de priver ces individus, qui rel\u00e8vent de la cat\u00e9gorie prot\u00e9g\u00e9e des personnes d\u00e9ficientes, de possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi, est donc discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue au sens de l'article 10 de la Loi. Je note en passant que l'avocat de la bande a reconnu dans ses observations finales qu'une [traduction] grande quantit\u00e9 de jurisprudence laisse entendre que les [traduction] affaires portant sur le d\u00e9pistage de drogues de ce genre sont, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, discriminatoires (voir Milazzo, au paragraphe 97).\nB. La bande s'est elle acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de pr\u00e9senter une explication raisonnable? [67] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, lorsqu'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, le fardeau revient alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication raisonnable. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la bande a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer qu'il existait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e pour l'adoption de la politique de d\u00e9pistage de drogues (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi). Pour ce faire, la bande doit \u00e9tablir que le fait d'accommoder ces individus, qui sont soit d\u00e9pendants \u00e0 la drogue ou qui sont per\u00e7us comme tel, imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 la bande, compte tenu de la sant\u00e9, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et du co\u00fbt (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\n[68] La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 une approche \u00e0 trois volets \u00e0 suivre lorsqu'on cherche \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie (voir Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin)). Un intim\u00e9 peut justifier la pratique contest\u00e9e en prouvant, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s :\nque l'employeur a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause; que l'employeur a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu'il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l'employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\n(i) La bande a-t-elle adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause? [69] Cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l'analyse ne vise pas la validit\u00e9 de la norme, mais plut\u00f4t la validit\u00e9 de son objectif plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (Meiorin, au paragraphe 59). Je suis convaincu, compte tenu de la preuve, que l'objectif de l'adoption de la politique Apte au travail de la bande \u00e9tait d'\u00e9viter que des employ\u00e9s soient bless\u00e9s, ainsi que d'\u00e9viter les dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la bande, en raison d'une d\u00e9ficience caus\u00e9e par la drogue ou l'alcool. \u00c0 mon avis, ces objectifs sont rationnellement li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail des p\u00eacheurs (matelots de pont, second capitaines, capitaines) dans un environnement s\u00e9curitaire, ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'assurance d'une viabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme de leurs emplois.\n(ii) La bande a-t-elle adopt\u00e9 la norme de bonne foi? [70] \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape de l'analyse, l'intim\u00e9 doit \u00e9tablir qu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme en croyant honn\u00eatement et de bonne foi qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'accomplissement de son objectif, sans aucune intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le plaignant (Meiorin, au paragraphe 60). Si l'imposition de la norme n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire ou si elle \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par une intention discriminatoire, elle ne peut alors pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\n[71] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, peu de temps apr\u00e8s l'ouverture de la p\u00eacherie commerciale d'Eskasoni en 2001, des rapports ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au sujet du fait que certains p\u00eacheurs se trouvaient en mer alors qu'ils \u00e9taient sous l'influence de drogues ou d'alcool. Le chef actuel de la bande Eskasoni est Charles Joseph Dennis. Il \u00e9tait le directeur de la p\u00eacherie commerciale \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait re\u00e7u de nombreuses plaintes de personnes qui travaillaient sur les navires de la bande et qui \u00e9taient inqui\u00e8tes pour leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9 personnelle parce que d'autres p\u00eacheurs travaillaient sous l'influence de drogues ou d'alcool. Le chef Dennis se souvient d'un capitaine qui lui a dit qu'un jour, alors qu'il \u00e9tait en mer, il croyait que tout son \u00e9quipage \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 par-dessus bord. Au moment o\u00f9 il allait appeler la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re, il a remarqu\u00e9 des volutes de fum\u00e9e qui venaient de l'int\u00e9rieur du canot de sauvetage du navire. Ses trois matelots de pont s'\u00e9taient gliss\u00e9s \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur pour fumer de la drogue.\n[72] Thomas Johnston, qui \u00e9tait le directeur de l'exploitation de l'EFWC jusqu'en 2004, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'une fois, un capitaine \u00e9tait si saoul alors qu'il p\u00eachait qu'il s'est \u00e9vanoui. L'un des matelots de pont \u00e0 d\u00fb ramener le navire au port et ce faisant, il a frapp\u00e9 le navire contre le quai. M. Johnston a aussi entendu parler du fait que certains p\u00eacheurs faisaient du trafic de drogue sur les navires de p\u00eache de la bande. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, il y a une consommation et un abus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9s d'alcool et de drogues au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 d'Eskasoni.\n[73] Par cons\u00e9quent, la bande soutient qu'elle a adopt\u00e9 la politique Apte au travail en croyant honn\u00eatement et de bonne foi que cette politique aiderait \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir ou \u00e0 r\u00e9duire la consommation d'alcool ou de drogues par ses employ\u00e9s et ainsi les emp\u00eacher de se blesser ou de causer des dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la bande. La bande esp\u00e9rait aussi que la politique aurait l'avantage d'aider \u00e0 freiner la consommation de drogues ou d'alcool au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[74] M. Dennis semblait laisser entendre dans son t\u00e9moignage que la politique avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour un tout autre objectif : celui d'affecter d\u00e9favorablement certains individus ou certaines familles au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 d'Eskasoni. Cependant, la preuve n'appuie pas cette interpr\u00e9tation. Les proc\u00e8s-verbaux d'un certain nombre de r\u00e9unions du Conseil de bande ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience. Ils font part de l'appui g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des conseillers pour l'adoption de la politique. Ils ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que leurs motifs pour l'appui de cette politique sont tous li\u00e9s \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en milieu de travail et \u00e0 l'encouragement \u00e0 vivre sans toxicomanie dans la collectivit\u00e9. Aucun autre motif n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9. M. Dennis a laiss\u00e9 entendre que certains des conseillers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9s d'adopter cette position d'appui envers la politique, mais il n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve de cette interpr\u00e9tation. Aucun t\u00e9moin et aucune preuve n'a confirm\u00e9 sa d\u00e9claration. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Maloney a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que des [traduction] probl\u00e8mes de famille existent dans toute petite collectivit\u00e9 et que des [traduction] guerres de clans et des factions peuvent avoir [traduction] jou\u00e9 un petit r\u00f4le, mais que la question principale pour la bande \u00e9tait celle de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et du maintien de la productivit\u00e9 et de la viabilit\u00e9 de la p\u00eacherie. Il n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont ces guerres se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es. M. Johnston a reconnu qu'il y a eu une dispute entre certaines familles au sujet de la politique, mais cela n'est arriv\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s l'adoption de la politique, alors que les groupes au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre des positions au sujet de sa mise en uvre. Il convient de noter qu'aucune des cibles all\u00e9gu\u00e9es de la politique Apte au travail n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es comme t\u00e9moin afin de pr\u00e9ciser si elles avaient per\u00e7u la situation de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que M. Dennis.\n[75] De fa\u00e7on peut-\u00eatre plus importante, comme la question porte sur le deuxi\u00e8me des trois volets \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l'analyse Meiorin, il n'y a eu aucune affirmation ou preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e selon laquelle l'intention de la bande, telle que l'a exprim\u00e9e la Cour supr\u00eame dans Meiorin, \u00e9tait de faire preuve de discrimination envers certaines personnes qui avaient une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elles \u00e9taient d\u00e9ficientes). M. Dennis soutient dans sa plainte que c'est ce groupe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vis\u00e9 par la discrimination.\n[76] Je conclus que la preuve au sujet des all\u00e9gations de motifs cach\u00e9s de la bande quant \u00e0 l'adoption de la politique n'est pas convaincante. Il ne s'agit de rien de plus que des hypoth\u00e8ses de la part de M. Dennis. Je suis convaincu que la bande a \u00e9tabli que la politique a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en croyant de bonne foi qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'atteinte des objectifs pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l'analyse Meiorin.\n(iii) La norme est-elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail? [77] Afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ce volet de l'analyse, la bande doit d\u00e9montrer qu'elle ne pouvait pas accommoder les personnes qui avaient une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue ou \u00e0 l'alcool (c'est-\u00e0-dire les personnes d\u00e9ficientes) qui obtenaient des r\u00e9sultats positifs quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence de drogues ou d'alcool dans leur corps, sans qu'elles ne subissent de contraintes excessives au sujet de la sant\u00e9, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et du co\u00fbt (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi). La bande soutient qu'elle aurait subi des contraintes excessives dans ce cas, tant sur le plan du facteur de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 que du facteur du co\u00fbt.\na) La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 comme pr\u00e9occupation - un environnement de travail s\u00e9curitaire [78] La bande soutient qu'elle doit faire tous les efforts possibles afin d'\u00e9viter que les employ\u00e9s sous l'influence de l'alcool et de la drogue travaillent sur ses navires, pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de ces m\u00eames employ\u00e9s. La bande doit donc exiger que ses travailleurs subissent un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues et d'alcool. Tout accommodement qui emp\u00eacherait la bande d'interdire l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses navires aux employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9chouent le test imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 la bande.\n[79] Quant \u00e0 la question de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en milieu de travail, M. Dennis a reconnu dans son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, pr\u00e9par\u00e9 conjointement avec la Commission, que le travail d'un capitaine d'un navire de p\u00eache commerciale est [traduction] essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. M. Dennis n'a pas fait une telle concession quant aux autres emplois disponibles sur les navires de p\u00eache de la bande. Quant \u00e0 elle, la bande soutient que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est une pr\u00e9occupation majeure pour tous les employ\u00e9s qui p\u00eachent sur ses navires (capitaines, second capitaines et matelots de pont).\n[80] Aux fins de cette analyse, je ne crois pas qu'il est important de faire une distinction entre le travail suppos\u00e9ment essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le travail qui n'est pas essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Ce qu'il faut r\u00e9ellement d\u00e9terminer, c'est si le fait d'accommoder le groupe d'individus en question (les personnes qui ont une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue ou \u00e0 l'alcool) imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 la bande au sujet de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, comme la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[81] Greg Johnstone, le conseiller qui a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer l'\u00e9bauche de la politique Apte au travail, a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e par la bande \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 titre d'expert en gestion du risque en milieu de travail, en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et sant\u00e9 au travail, ainsi qu'en toxicologie. Son expertise dans ces domaines a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l'audience. M. Johnstone a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en ce qui a trait au devoir de tout employeur d'assurer la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de tous les [traduction] partis \u00e0 l'environnement de travail, la r\u00e8gle ou le principe directeur en est un de pr\u00e9vention. L'un des principaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'un syst\u00e8me de gestion de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est l'identification, l'\u00e9valuation et le contr\u00f4le des dangers. Plus l'exposition au danger qui pourrait entra\u00eener des accidents ou des dommages est grande, plus la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 devient une pr\u00e9occupation pour l'emploi, ce qui justifie le besoin d'une reconnaissance, d'une \u00e9valuation, d'un contr\u00f4le et d'une pr\u00e9vention efficaces des dommages associ\u00e9s au danger.\n[82] Dans le cas d'une exploitation commerciale de p\u00eache telle que celle de la bande, la nature m\u00eame des activit\u00e9s et de l'exposition aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments cr\u00e9e beaucoup de dangers, de risques et de probabilit\u00e9s de dommages qui, d'apr\u00e8s M. Johnstone, rendent le travail [traduction] en terme de postes hautement critiques pou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Dans ce contexte, je pr\u00e9sume qu'il veut dire que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 devient donc une question plus pr\u00e9occupante en raison des conditions de travail dominantes. M. Johnstone a not\u00e9 que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 devient une pr\u00e9occupation m\u00eame en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'emploi le plus banal sur un navire qui est en mer et loin des c\u00f4tes parce que, si une situation d'urgence se pr\u00e9sente (par exemple une mer agit\u00e9e, un feu \u00e0 bord, r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer une personne qui est pass\u00e9e par-dessus bord, etc.), on s'attend \u00e0 ce que tous les employ\u00e9s aident. M. Maloney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les navires de p\u00eache se rendent de 100 \u00e0 200 km au loin de la c\u00f4te, o\u00f9 le temps et les conditions de l'oc\u00e9an changent rapidement. Il arrive que des fen\u00eatres soient d\u00e9truites par une mer agit\u00e9e sur les bateaux et il arrive que les \u00e9quipages aient \u00e0 couper leurs lignes de p\u00eache et \u00e0 retourner rapidement au port.\n[83] M. Johnstone a mentionn\u00e9 un certain nombre d'\u00e9tudes au sujet de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des navires de p\u00eache qui confirmaient la nature dangereuse de la p\u00eache commerciale. Il a aussi cit\u00e9 le Nova Scotia Workers' Compensation Board Rate Book, qui \u00e9num\u00e8re les primes payables par les employeurs. Ces primes varient selon les niveaux d'indemnisation que la commission \u00e0 d\u00fb payer aux employ\u00e9s par le pass\u00e9. D'apr\u00e8s M. Johnstone, le risque de dommages r\u00e9el associ\u00e9 \u00e0 certains types d'emplois est refl\u00e9t\u00e9 par l'importance des primes. Les primes pour les emplois dans le domaine de la p\u00eacherie commerciale (en mer) se trouvent pr\u00e8s du maximum de l'\u00e9chelle pour la province. M. Johnstone est d'avis que d\u00e8s qu'un employ\u00e9 embarque sur un navire et quitte le port, la nature m\u00eame de l'emploi devient dangereuse en raison de nombreux risques et des circonstances dans lesquelles ces risques peuvent entra\u00eener des dommages et m\u00eame la mort.\n[84] M. Dennis a mentionn\u00e9 certains de ces risques dans son propre t\u00e9moignage. Son navire est tomb\u00e9 en panne quatre fois en un an et a d\u00fb \u00eatre remorqu\u00e9 jusqu'au port. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que le service de Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re ne laissait pas les p\u00eacheurs quitter le port lors de journ\u00e9es plus [traduction] venteuses, il est parfois all\u00e9 en mer alors qu'elle \u00e9tait agit\u00e9e. Lorsqu'il travaille sur des navires qui p\u00eachent du crabe des neiges, l'\u00e9quipement qu'il utilise comprend une vire qui est compos\u00e9 d'un syst\u00e8me de poulies et d'installations hydrauliques, qui sort les pi\u00e8ges de l'eau. Le capitaine contr\u00f4le le vire, alors que les matelots de pont attrapent les cordes, vident les pi\u00e8ges, mettent d'autres app\u00e2ts et placent les pi\u00e8ges \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du navire pour qu'ils soient jet\u00e9s \u00e0 l'eau. Les navires qui p\u00eachent la crevette utilisent un treuil qui soul\u00e8ve un filet. Les matelots de pont vident le filet lorsqu'il est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 bord et ils placent les crevettes dans des sacs. M. Dennis a reconnu que si l'\u00e9quipement utilis\u00e9 dans la p\u00eache commerciale n'est pas entretenu correctement, les p\u00eacheurs pourraient \u00eatre bless\u00e9s si, par exemple, un c\u00e2ble est endommag\u00e9 ou l'une des poulies se d\u00e9tache.\n[85] M. Dennis \u00e9tait le seul matelot de pont sur les navires pour lesquels il a travaill\u00e9 qui portait un gilet de sauvetage (qu'il s'\u00e9tait achet\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame). Les matelots de pont ne sont pas oblig\u00e9s de porter un gilet de sauvetage en mer, ce qui les expose \u00e0 un plus grand risque de danger s'ils passent par-dessus bord et qui, on pourrait le croire, risquerait de rendre la t\u00e2che difficile pour le reste de l'\u00e9quipage qui tenterait de les sauver. M. Dennis se souvient aussi d'un incident lors duquel un autre matelot de pont a plong\u00e9 dans l'eau pour d\u00e9m\u00ealer une corde qui \u00e9tait prise dans le propulseur du bateau. Cette personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 gravement bless\u00e9e en faisant cela.\n[86] \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve est plus que convaincante que les conditions de travail mettent encore plus \u00e0 risque la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de tous les employ\u00e9s qui travaillent sur les navires de p\u00eache de la bande, y compris les matelots de pont.\nb) Le travail avec les facult\u00e9s affaiblies pose un danger \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 [87] D'apr\u00e8s M. Johnstone, une personne dont la capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle et l'aptitude au travail dangereux est compromise en raison de consommation de drogues ou d'alcool pose un danger important pour sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et celle des autres dans ce type d'environnement de travail. Il faut approcher un tel danger avec la m\u00eame prudence et diligence raisonnable qu'on utiliserait dans la pr\u00e9sence, par exemple, d'\u00e9quipement d\u00e9fectueux ou inad\u00e9quat, d'un manque de comp\u00e9tence de la part des employ\u00e9s ou dans des conditions de travail ins\u00e9cures. Dans ces circonstances, un employeur doit appliquer les m\u00eames principes et mesures de gestion saine de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne, qui au fond repr\u00e9sente un danger, qu'il appliquerait \u00e0 un danger qui n'est pas de nature humaine. C'est-\u00e0-dire que l'employeur doit activement chercher, \u00e9valuer, surveiller et contr\u00f4ler les dangers respectifs afin de pr\u00e9venir les r\u00e9sultats d\u00e9favorables qui pourraient raisonnablement d\u00e9couler de la situation si elle n'\u00e9tait pas contr\u00f4l\u00e9e. M. Johnstone compare cette approche au concept de gestion du risque connu sous le nom de principe de pr\u00e9caution, qui pr\u00e9voit que des mesures de protection doivent \u00eatre prises par les intervenants lorsqu'il y a des preuves raisonnables que l'omission de le faire entra\u00eenerait des dommages.\n[88] La politique Apte au travail adopt\u00e9e par la bande pr\u00e9voyait que le test de d\u00e9pistage porterait sur la pr\u00e9sence de l'alcool et de cinq types de drogue (connu sous le nom de test Panel V) :\nCannabis (marijuana, hachisch, huile de cannabis);\nAmph\u00e9tamines (par exemple le speed, la crystal meth);\nLes opio\u00efdes ou les opiac\u00e9s (par exemple la morphine, l'oxycodone);\nLa coca\u00efne (y compris le crack);\nLa phencyclidine (PCP) (un anesth\u00e9sique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires).\nM. Johnstone a mentionn\u00e9 que le test Panel V \u00e9tait un test [traduction] typique et qu'il s'agissait de la [traduction] norme de l'industrie. Toutes ces drogues peuvent affecter les fonctions d'une personne dans la p\u00e9riode suivant imm\u00e9diatement la consommation.\n[89] D'apr\u00e8s M. Johnstone, la simple pr\u00e9sence d'une drogue qui est reconnue comme une substance pouvant affecter les fonctions du travailleur devrait \u00eatre un fondement suffisant pour avoir recours au principe de pr\u00e9caution, c'est-\u00e0-dire en retirant l'employ\u00e9 en question du lieu de travail o\u00f9 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est essentielle, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'une \u00e9valuation ad\u00e9quate et une gestion des risques associ\u00e9s soit termin\u00e9e, particuli\u00e8rement dans les cas o\u00f9 la quantit\u00e9 de drogue d\u00e9tect\u00e9e d\u00e9passe les niveaux acceptables.\n[90] Cette preuve est convaincante. \u00c0 mon avis, il est \u00e9vident qu'un employ\u00e9 qui travaille sous l'influence d'une drogue ou de l'alcool pose un danger important \u00e0 sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 celle des autres dans un environnement de travail comme celui des navires de p\u00eache de l'EFWC.\nc) Le test de de d\u00e9pistage de drogues et d'alcool est-il un moyen efficace de d\u00e9tecter la pr\u00e9sence d'un danger en milieu de travail? [91] M. Dennis soutient que le processus de d\u00e9pistage de drogues et d'alcool est inefficace comme moyen de d\u00e9tecter la pr\u00e9sence en milieu de travail d'un danger li\u00e9 aux facult\u00e9s affaiblies des travailleurs. Il all\u00e8gue, par exemple, que le d\u00e9pistage des cannabino\u00efdes ne mesure pas l'affaiblissement actuel des facult\u00e9s, mais simplement la pr\u00e9sence de la drogue dans le corps de l'individu caus\u00e9e par une consommation ant\u00e9rieure. M. Johnstone a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le cannabis est une drogue qui est absorb\u00e9e par le gras corporel. Bien que le niveau de pr\u00e9sence de la drogue dans le sang puisse diminuer, une quantit\u00e9 continue de s'\u00e9chapper du gras corporel. Une seule consommation de marijuana peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cel\u00e9e (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle d\u00e9passera les niveaux \u00e9tablis par la politique Apte au travail) jusqu'\u00e0 dix jours plus tard. Une consommation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re (toutes les semaines ou tous les jours) peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cel\u00e9e un ou m\u00eame deux mois plus tard.\n[92] Par cons\u00e9quent, est-il utile d'effectuer un test de d\u00e9pistage pour des drogues telles que les cannabino\u00efdes si la consommation peut avoir eu lieu des semaines plus t\u00f4t et si le test de d\u00e9pistage n'est pas effectu\u00e9 alors que la personne se trouve au travail? M. Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il reste des effets persistants et r\u00e9siduels associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la consommation de drogues, y compris les cannabino\u00efdes. Ces effets comprennent des perturbations continues dans les fonctions du corps (des perturbations au niveau du sommeil et des hormones), des d\u00e9ficiences nutritionnelles, des dommages en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 ou de toxicit\u00e9 caus\u00e9s aux organes, des pr\u00e9occupations avec des difficult\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de relations et m\u00eame des probl\u00e8mes financiers ou juridiques associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la consommation de drogues. M\u00eame si une personne a suspendu ou a arr\u00eat\u00e9 sa consommation de substances, l'un ou plusieurs de ces sympt\u00f4mes peuvent contribuer \u00e0 une rechute ou \u00e0 un retour \u00e0 la consommation, possiblement alors que la personne se trouve sur le navire. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'alcool, M. Johnstone a mentionn\u00e9 les gueules de bois, qui peuvent se poursuivre m\u00eame si l'alcool n'est plus pr\u00e9sent dans le sang d'un individu. Les effets persistants tels que les maux de t\u00eate et la fatigue continueront d'affaiblir les facult\u00e9s d'une personne et lui causeront ainsi des risques.\n[93] M. Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que certaines drogues comme le PCP, la coca\u00efne ainsi que la marijuana, lorsqu'elles sont prises en fortes doses, peuvent causer au consommateur des flashbacks longtemps apr\u00e8s la consommation. Ces flashbacks entra\u00eenent des perceptions sensorielles qui peuvent porter le consommateur \u00e0 devenir pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par des fantasmes, de mauvais souvenirs ou d'autres distractions, qui affaiblissent ses facult\u00e9s. De tels flashbacks sont particuli\u00e8rement importants dans le cas de consommation de drogues comme le PCP. M. Johnstone a not\u00e9 que de nos jours, du PCP est parfois ajout\u00e9 aux drogues de la rue comme la marijuana afin d'en augmenter les effets, simulant ainsi un produit de [traduction] bonne qualit\u00e9.\n[94] Dans un sens plus large, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la signification du d\u00e9pistage positif chez certaines personnes, m\u00eame si elles n'ont plus les facult\u00e9s affaiblies, M. Johnstone mentionne que la d\u00e9tection d'une drogue qui est reconnue pour mettre en danger la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'un employ\u00e9 peut et devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'un policier est alert\u00e9 \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'examiner le taux d'alcool\u00e9mie d'un conducteur lorsqu'il sent de l'alcool dans son haleine. Comme M. Johnstone le note, le grave probl\u00e8me du point de vue de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est le haut niveau d'incertitude associ\u00e9e \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat positif, sans savoir la port\u00e9e de l'affaiblissement des facult\u00e9s, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, du travailleur et de la fa\u00e7on dont cela pourrait augmenter les risques. \u00c0 son avis, le d\u00e9pistage de drogues est une mesure efficace et utile qui donne un certain fondement objectif \u00e0 partir duquel il est possible de prendre d'autres mesures qui pourraient efficacement traiter le probl\u00e8me. Comme le Tribunal l'a conclu dans Milazzo, au paragraphe 171, bien qu'un r\u00e9sultat positif de d\u00e9pistage de drogues n'indique pas que les facult\u00e9s de l'employ\u00e9 \u00e9taient r\u00e9ellement affaiblies alors qu'il se trouvait au travail, il sert de drapeau rouge qui peut aider \u00e0 cibler les employ\u00e9s qui posent un risque plus grand.\n[95] Y a-t-il d'autres moyens d'\u00e9valuer le risque? La bande pourrait-elle se fier aux p\u00eacheurs eux-m\u00eames pour qu'ils refusent de travailler sur un navire lorsqu'ils sont sous l'influence de drogues ou d'alcool? M. Dennis a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais travaill\u00e9 alors qu'il \u00e9tait sous l'influence de la marijuana. Une telle assurance, cependant, n'emp\u00eache pas la possibilit\u00e9 que les p\u00eacheurs continuent de subir les effets persistants apr\u00e8s usage que M. Johnstone a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage. De fa\u00e7on plus importante, M. Johnstone a not\u00e9 que les consommateurs de drogues risquaient peu d'\u00eatre enclins \u00e0 aviser leurs superviseurs de leur consommation de drogues ou de l'affaiblissement de leurs facult\u00e9s et qu'en fait, il est plus probable qu'ils nient leur consommation ainsi que les effets de la drogue sur eux. Lorsqu'un consommateur de drogues atteint un niveau avanc\u00e9 de consommation ou d'accoutumance (\u00e9tapes qui, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment, rel\u00e8veraient de la d\u00e9finition de d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue au sens de l'article 25 de la Loi), de nombreuses manifestations de cet \u00e9tat contribuent \u00e0 la n\u00e9gation et \u00e0 leur incapacit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuer leur propre niveau d'aptitudes.\n[96] Peut-on se fier aux superviseurs pour remarquer les facult\u00e9s affaiblies en raison de consommation de drogues parmi les employ\u00e9s? La politique Apte au travail avait pr\u00e9vu cette possibilit\u00e9. Dans la liste de responsabilit\u00e9s de la gestion pr\u00e9vues dans la politique, les gestionnaires ont la directive de confronter les employ\u00e9s au sujet de tout affaiblissement des capacit\u00e9s qu'ils ont remarqu\u00e9 et de sugg\u00e9rer \u00e0 ces employ\u00e9s de se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation et \u00e0 un traitement appropri\u00e9, ou m\u00eame de les r\u00e9f\u00e9rer directement. Les gestionnaires peuvent envoyer les employ\u00e9s qu'ils soup\u00e7onnent avoir consomm\u00e9 de la drogue ou de l'alcool \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9pistage. Dans la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la mise en uvre de la politique, la bande a fourni une formation, pendant les s\u00e9ances d'information qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es exclusivement aux capitaines, sur la fa\u00e7on de cibler les employ\u00e9s qui ont consomm\u00e9 des drogues.\n[97] M. Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, bien que les observations subjectives puissent \u00eatre utiles, il ne s'agit pas d'un moyen efficace d'\u00e9valuer les risques. Tout d'abord, les interactions entre le superviseur et l'employ\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre insuffisantes pour permettre au superviseur de remarquer un affaiblissement des facult\u00e9s. \u00c9videmment, les navires de p\u00eache de la bande ne constituent pas un environnement de travail tr\u00e8s large, mais n\u00e9anmoins, on a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au moins un capitaine a \u00e9t\u00e9 tellement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par ses propres t\u00e2ches qu'il n'a pas remarqu\u00e9 que son \u00e9quipage complet s'\u00e9tait cach\u00e9 dans un canot de sauvetage pour consommer de la drogue. Ce qui est le plus inqui\u00e9tant, c'est l'\u00e9tat des superviseurs eux-m\u00eames. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9, on a rapport\u00e9 certains incidents au cours desquels des capitaines avaient les facult\u00e9s affaiblies par des drogues ou de l'alcool. En mer, il n'y a personne pour les surveiller. Finalement, m\u00eame le superviseur le mieux form\u00e9 peut \u00eatre d\u00e9jou\u00e9 efficacement par un employ\u00e9 qui a consomm\u00e9 de la drogue. M. Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que malgr\u00e9 ses nombreuses ann\u00e9es de formation et d'exp\u00e9rience dans les domaines de la toxicologie et de l'affaiblissement des facult\u00e9s, il peut \u00eatre manipul\u00e9 par une personne exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e qui a des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de consommation de drogues. Le d\u00e9pistage de drogues et d'alcool, par cons\u00e9quent, sert d'outil scientifique objectif qui ne peut pas \u00eatre d\u00e9jou\u00e9 comme une personne qui tirerait des conclusions fond\u00e9es uniquement sur une observation subjective des yeux ou du comportement d'une personne, par exemple.\n[98] Certains peuvent aussi douter de l'efficacit\u00e9 du d\u00e9pistage, compte tenu de la possibilit\u00e9 qu'un individu pourrait \u00e9viter de consommer des drogues ou de l'alcool avant de se soumettre au test, pourrait r\u00e9ussir le test de d\u00e9pistage, mais ensuite consommer des drogues ou de l'alcool par apr\u00e8s et m\u00eame travailler alors qu'il en subit encore les effets. M. Johnstone a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9occupation en mentionnant que le test de d\u00e9pistage pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'emploi est une occasion d'examiner un employ\u00e9 avant de placer cette personne et ses coll\u00e8gues dans une situation dangereuse. Cependant, il est possible que cette personne obtienne un r\u00e9sultat n\u00e9gatif et qu'elle consomme ensuite des drogues et se rende au travail avec les facult\u00e9s affaiblies. N\u00e9anmoins, le processus en vaut la peine puisqu'il aide \u00e0 cibler les personnes qui ont une telle d\u00e9pendance qu'ils en ont perdu toute ma\u00eetrise de soi et qui ne peuvent plus g\u00e9rer leur consommation, m\u00eame pour la seule p\u00e9riode du test de d\u00e9pistage.\n[99] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu que le processus de d\u00e9pistage de drogues et d'alcool de la bande est un moyen efficace de d\u00e9tecter la pr\u00e9sence de dangers \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en milieu de travail et, en d\u00e9finitive, d'atteindre l'objectif d'emp\u00eacher les p\u00eacheurs de travailler lorsque leurs facult\u00e9s sont affaiblies.\nd) Le facteur du co\u00fbt - les r\u00e9percussions sur la p\u00eacherie commerciale de la bande [100] La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 n'est pas la seule raison pour laquelle la bande est pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par les dangers et les risques cr\u00e9\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sence en milieu de travail d'employ\u00e9s dont les facult\u00e9s sont affaiblies. La bande compte \u00e9norm\u00e9ment sur les profits de la p\u00eacherie commerciale pour garantir le bien-\u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la collectivit\u00e9 et de ses membres. La bande \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par les pertes financi\u00e8res qu'elle subirait si les op\u00e9rations de la p\u00eacherie devaient \u00eatre interrompues.\n[101] Les finances de la bande d'Eskasoni sont dans un \u00e9tat critique depuis des ann\u00e9es. En 1995, son d\u00e9ficit accumul\u00e9 avait atteint 14 millions de dollars. Le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien (MAINC) est intervenu et a impos\u00e9 un syst\u00e8me de cogestion de la bande, en fonction duquel une entreprise ind\u00e9pendante de v\u00e9rification a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e comme Co-gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations de la bande. Depuis 2001, Alan Simpson, un comptable agr\u00e9\u00e9, occupe le poste de Co-gestionnaire de la bande. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'un plan de 15 ans a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en place afin de r\u00e9duire le d\u00e9ficit \u00e0 raison de 875 000 $ par ann\u00e9e. La bande doit atteindre cet objectif tout en continuant de fournir des services \u00e0 la collectivit\u00e9, services qui comprennent l'aide sociale (environ 10 millions de dollars par ann\u00e9e), l'\u00e9ducation (un autre 10 millions de dollars par ann\u00e9e) et le logement (environ 1 million de dollars par ann\u00e9e). Le budget total d'exploitation de la bande est d'environ 50 millions de dollars. D'apr\u00e8s M. Simpson, le financement du MAINC et d'autres gouvernements ne d\u00e9passe pas 30 millions de dollars. La bande se fie donc sur d'autres sources de financement pour \u00e9quilibrer son budget et atteindre ses objectifs de r\u00e9duction du d\u00e9ficit. Ces autres sources comprennent le jeu, la vente de tabac et la p\u00eacherie commerciale. Cette derni\u00e8re contribue environ 2 millions de dollars net annuellement au budget. Sans l'infusion des revenus de la p\u00eacherie commerciale, la bande serait incapable de respecter ses objectifs. Elle devrait donc couper du financement dans des secteurs tels que le logement ou l'aide sociale. Le fait que la bande se fie sur les revenus de la p\u00eacherie commerciale et sur d'autres sources locales de financement est accentu\u00e9 par le fait que la population de la bande, d'apr\u00e8s le gestionnaire de la bande, Gerard Francis, augmente \u00e0 un taux beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que le taux d'augmentation de financement du gouvernement.\n[102] La bande a fait face \u00e0 des d\u00e9fis importants en ce qui a trait au maintien de son revenu d\u00e9coulant de la p\u00eacherie commerciale. Les prix des fruits de mer ont grandement diminu\u00e9 depuis 2001, lorsque, suivant l'entente Marshall, la p\u00eacherie commerciale de l'EFWC a lanc\u00e9 ses op\u00e9rations. Il n'y a eu qu'une augmentation tr\u00e8s modeste des prix au cours de la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, uniquement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 quelques-unes des esp\u00e8ces captur\u00e9es. De plus, l'augmentation des frais d'exploitation, notamment le carburant pour les navires, menace de diminuer les profits, bien que ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne n'\u00e9tait probablement pas un facteur aussi important en 2004, auquel moment M. Dennis a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte. Le fait est que la viabilit\u00e9 de la p\u00eacherie commerciale de la bande est fragile; beaucoup de facteurs peuvent mettre cette viabilit\u00e9 en jeu. En m\u00eame temps, la bande se fie \u00e9norm\u00e9ment aux revenus qui en d\u00e9coulent, sans compter que pr\u00e8s de cent p\u00eacheurs et leur famille d\u00e9pendent du revenu qu'ils obtiennent du travail saisonnier et des prestations d'assurance-emploi auxquelles ils ont droit lors de la saison morte. Les possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi \u00e0 Eskasoni sont limit\u00e9es et le taux de ch\u00f4mage est \u00e9lev\u00e9. Par contre, le fait que cet emploi r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur existe diminue la demande en mati\u00e8re d'aide sociale aupr\u00e8s de la bande.\n[103] La bande soutient que si elle permet la consommation d'alcool et de drogues sur ses navires, sans la contr\u00f4ler, cette source de revenu sera en danger. M. Maloney a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'en 2003, des probl\u00e8mes ont fait surface en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la disponibilit\u00e9 des \u00e9quipages. Les appels au travail pour les matelots de pont se font \u00e0 toute heure de la journ\u00e9e, m\u00eame la nuit, en raison des changements au niveau du temps et de la mar\u00e9e. Les navires d'Eskasoni partent de ports qui se trouvent \u00e0 une certaine distance de la collectivit\u00e9 (par exemple de Louisbourg ou d'Arichat), ce qui signifie que les \u00e9quipages ont besoin d'un peu de temps pour se rendre aux navires. La [traduction] p\u00e9riode propice est donc courte. Selon M. Maloney, beaucoup de membres d'\u00e9quipage ne r\u00e9pondaient pas \u00e0 ces appels au travail, souvent en raison d'une consommation de drogues ou d'alcool. Ils n'\u00e9taient simplement pas en \u00e9tat de travailler. En 2003, beaucoup de marchandise a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e en mer, y compris 300 000 lbs de crevettes, ce qui repr\u00e9sente environ 600 000 $. D'autres bandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9es \u00e0 p\u00eacher ces crevettes.\n[104] Gerard Francis, le gestionnaire de la bande, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il craignait que le MPO enl\u00e8ve les permis de p\u00eache de la bande et qu'il saisisse ses navires s'il d\u00e9couvrait des \u00e9quipages qui consommaient des drogues ou de l'alcool alors qu'ils \u00e9taient en mer. Une autre pr\u00e9occupation dont la bande \u00e9tait au courant lorsque la politique a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e, d'apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9clarations de plusieurs t\u00e9moins, \u00e9tait la possibilit\u00e9 de responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle, conform\u00e9ment aux modifications au Code criminel qui sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur apr\u00e8s la mort tragique qui a eu lieu \u00e0 la mine Westray en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. Le projet de loi C-45 a impos\u00e9 une obligation explicite \u00e0 ceux qui ont la responsabilit\u00e9 de diriger le travail d'autres personnes, soit l'obligation de prendre des mesures raisonnables afin de pr\u00e9venir les blessures corporelles ou les blessures mortelles parmi les employ\u00e9s. Si un employeur ne respecte pas cette obligation, l'organisation et ses cadres sup\u00e9rieurs pourraient \u00eatre accus\u00e9s d'un acte criminel, puni par des amendes \u00e9lev\u00e9es. L'avocat de la bande \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque avait inform\u00e9 le Conseil de bande de l'existence de ces nouvelles dispositions.\n[105] Par cons\u00e9quent, en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances, \u00e0 mon avis, la bande a \u00e9tabli qu'elle subirait des contraintes tant au niveau de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 que du co\u00fbt si elle ne mettait pas en uvre une politique visant \u00e0 emp\u00eacher les membres des \u00e9quipages de travailler sur ses navires alors qu'ils sont sous l'influence de drogues et d'alcool. Cependant, il reste une question \u00e0 trancher : cette contrainte est-elle excessive?\ne) La contrainte de la bande est-elle excessive? [106] Pour trouver une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question, les tribunaux doivent tenir compte des diverses fa\u00e7ons dont les capacit\u00e9s de chaque individu peuvent \u00eatre accommod\u00e9es. Ils doivent aussi \u00eatre innovateurs tout en \u00e9tant pratiques lorsqu'ils \u00e9tudient la meilleure fa\u00e7on de le faire dans les circonstances en cause (Meiorin, au paragraphe 64).\n[107] L'une des approches qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e dans Meiorin quant \u00e0 l'exploration de l'accommodement des capacit\u00e9s d'un individu est d'examiner s'il existe diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons d'effectuer le travail qui est disponible. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la preuve d\u00e9montre que c'est impossible. Le seul travail qui peut \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 par les p\u00eacheurs est en mer, \u00e0 titre de matelots de pont, de seconds capitaines ou de capitaines. Les dangers et les risques li\u00e9s \u00e0 la p\u00eache en mer ne peuvent pas \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9s des t\u00e2ches li\u00e9es \u00e0 ces emplois. M. Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que m\u00eame les employ\u00e9s qui ont d'autres t\u00e2ches sur les navires de p\u00eache commerciale, tels que les cuisiniers, sont expos\u00e9s aux m\u00eames dangers et risques que les autres membres de l'\u00e9quipage. On s'attend \u00e0 ce qu'ils aident les autres membres de l'\u00e9quipage s'il y a une urgence en mer. De plus, ils peuvent faire face aux dangers particuliers li\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs emplois sp\u00e9cifiques, tels que le feu ou l'explosion de carburant et d'ingr\u00e9dients utilis\u00e9s pour cuisiner. Quoi qu'il en soit, aucune preuve ne m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l'existence d'emplois autres que ceux de matelots de pont, de second capitaines et de capitaines qui sont disponibles sur les navires de l'EFWC.\n[108] M. Dennis soutient que l'EFWC devrait offrir d'autres emplois dans des postes qui ne sont pas essentiels \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour les employ\u00e9s dont le r\u00e9sultat du test de d\u00e9pistage est positif, au moins pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle ces employ\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent des conseils ou des traitements pour leur d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue ou \u00e0 l'alcool. Il a m\u00eame sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que si aucun autre emploi n'\u00e9tait disponible, ces p\u00eacheurs devraient continuer de recevoir une certaine [traduction] compensation pendant leur traitement.\n[109] M. Johnston, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'EFWC, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 part les \u00e9quipages de p\u00eache, la p\u00eacherie commerciale employait environ dix personnes pendant la haute saison de p\u00eache, dont la plupart \u00e9taient mises \u00e0 pied \u00e0 la fin de la saison. Ces postes comprennent deux [traduction] surveillants, qui s'occupent de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sur les quais, deux r\u00e9partiteurs ou [traduction] personnes qui s'occupent des appels au travail, une personne qui organise l'horaire de travail et une personne qui d\u00e9place les pi\u00e8ges et les lignes de p\u00eache sur le quai. Un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s qui ont de l'exp\u00e9rience en science travaillent aussi dans la section de recherche et l'EFWC emploie aussi trois commis comptables et comptables \u00e0 temps plein. M. Leonard Denny, le gestionnaire de la p\u00eacherie commerciale, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que m\u00eame en \u00e9t\u00e9, la p\u00eacherie commerciale est tr\u00e8s rigoureuse en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la dotation, qui est compos\u00e9e des p\u00eacheurs et des quelques employ\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9s. Il n'y a aucun autre emploi disponible.\n[110] En fonction de la preuve que la bande a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, je suis convaincu qu'il n'existe aucun emploi substitut qui peut \u00eatre offert, dans la p\u00eacherie commerciale, aux personnes qui ont \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues, et il serait d\u00e9raisonnable de s'attendre \u00e0 ce que la bande cr\u00e9e de tels emplois ou paye simplement les p\u00eacheurs pendant qu'ils suivent un traitement pour leur d\u00e9pendance (voir Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d'Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP-FTQ), 2000 CSC 43, aux paragraphes 15 \u00e0 18; Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Tribunal des droits de la personne), [1997] A.C.F. no 1734 (Q.L.)(1re inst.) (Dumont-Ferlatte), au paragraphe 44). Il convient de noter que les p\u00eacheurs comme M. Dennis ne sont pas des employ\u00e9s permanents, m\u00eame s'ils ont la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre r\u00e9embauch\u00e9s chaque ann\u00e9e. Le salaire que ces p\u00eacheurs re\u00e7oivent est g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 par la vente des fruits de mer qu'ils p\u00eachent. La p\u00eacherie commerciale n'a aucune autre source de revenu. De fa\u00e7on plus importante, la preuve d\u00e9montre clairement que la p\u00eacherie commerciale a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en vue de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer de l'emploi et des revenus pour la bande et ses membres; elle ne visait pas \u00e0 servir de remplacement pour le programme d'aide sociale de la bande.\nf) La politique impose-t-elle un fardeau excessif aux employ\u00e9s? [111] M. Dennis a soutenu que la politique en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9pistage de drogues de la bande imposait un fardeau excessif aux personnes \u00e0 qui elle s'appliquait. Selon Meiorin, au paragraphe 65, il s'agit d'un des facteurs dont on peut tenir compte lorsqu'on \u00e9value si une politique \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire. Il a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que la politique \u00e9tait injuste envers les personnes comme lui qui obtenaient un r\u00e9sultat positif au test de d\u00e9pistage et \u00e0 qui on refusait un emploi, mais qui r\u00e9ellement n'avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pris \u00e0 travailler alors que leurs facult\u00e9s \u00e9taient affaiblies.\n[112] Cependant, m\u00eame si certaines personnes croient qu'une politique d'un employeur est [traduction] injuste, elle ne constitue pas n\u00e9cessairement un manquement \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Comme le Tribunal l'a soulign\u00e9 dans Milazzo, au paragraphe 180, le fait qu'un employ\u00e9 ait un r\u00e9sultat positif dans un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues impos\u00e9 par un employeur ne signifie pas automatiquement que l'employ\u00e9 a une d\u00e9ficience et qu'il a donc droit \u00e0 la protection de la Loi.\n[113] La possibilit\u00e9 qui existe en vertu de la politique Apte au travail, qui permet \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de se soumettre \u00e0 un autre test de d\u00e9pistage, d'obtenir une \u00e9valuation et de recevoir un traitement, contraste nettement avec la composante de la politique dans la d\u00e9cision Milazzo, en fonction de laquelle le Tribunal a conclu que cette politique ne respectait pas les exigences de la Loi. Dans cette affaire, on a simplement enlev\u00e9 les offres d'emploi aux employ\u00e9s \u00e9ventuels qui souffraient de d\u00e9ficiences li\u00e9es \u00e0 la drogue, sans que l'employeur ait d'abord examin\u00e9 la question de l'accommodement. Le Tribunal a conclu que les employeurs n'avaient pas le droit de mettre en uvre une telle pratique. Le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 le contraste entre le traitement des employ\u00e9s \u00e9ventuels et la possibilit\u00e9 que l'employeur donne \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s existants qui, de leur propre gr\u00e9, l'informaient de leur probl\u00e8me quant \u00e0 la drogue ou \u00e0 l'alcool. L'employeur permettait \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s existants de se r\u00e9adapter et de revenir au travail. Le Tribunal a fait valoir qu'\u00e0 tout le moins, l'employeur devait offrir un type semblable d'accommodement aux employ\u00e9s \u00e9ventuels.\n[114] En l'esp\u00e8ce, je note que la politique Apte au travail offre beaucoup plus d'accommodement aux employ\u00e9s \u00e9ventuels que la politique dont il \u00e9tait question dans l'affaire Milazzo. Par cons\u00e9quent, la politique refl\u00e8te la directive qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e dans Meiorin, au paragraphe 68, selon laquelle la norme \u00e9tablie par l'employeur devrait offrir un accommodement individuel, si cela est raisonnablement possible. La politique pr\u00e9voit que les personnes qui obtiennent un r\u00e9sultat positif au test de d\u00e9pistage peuvent se soumettre \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 ce test. M. Maloney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ces personnes ont re\u00e7u un document qui expliquait la nature du test de d\u00e9pistage et les circonstances qui entra\u00eeneraient un r\u00e9sultat positif. Ce document donnait aux employ\u00e9s \u00e9ventuels l'information dont ils avaient besoin afin d'ajuster leurs habitudes, de r\u00e9ussir le prochain test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues et de pouvoir retourner au travail. Un employ\u00e9 qui \u00e9chouait le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues pouvait s'y soumettre encore deux fois avant d'\u00eatre refus\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement, mais le refus \u00e0 l'emploi ne durait que jusqu'\u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e suivante. Entre-temps, on encouragerait ou on obligerait l'employ\u00e9, en fonction du nombre d'\u00e9checs de test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues, \u00e0 obtenir une \u00e9valuation ou un traitement pour son probl\u00e8me. On esp\u00e9rait ainsi que le traitement de l'employ\u00e9 serait couronn\u00e9 de succ\u00e8s et que cet employ\u00e9 n'aurait plus de r\u00e9sultats positifs au test de d\u00e9pistage \u00e0 l'avenir.\n[115] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que la bande subirait une contrainte excessive fond\u00e9e sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le co\u00fbt si on exigeait qu'elle permette aux personnes qui obtenaient un r\u00e9sultat positif au d\u00e9pistage de drogues de travailler sur ses navires. Il \u00e9tait impossible d'accommoder ces personnes en leur offrant un autre emploi sur terre ou sur la mer, puisqu'il n'existait pas de tels emplois. De plus, il serait d\u00e9raisonnable d'exiger que la bande paie un salaire \u00e0 un p\u00eacheur qui ne travaille pas (et qui, par cons\u00e9quent, ne rapporte aucun revenu \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie). \u00c0 mon avis, ces deux types d'accommodement auraient in\u00e9vitablement impos\u00e9 une contrainte excessive \u00e0 la bande. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, les proc\u00e9dures d'accommodement que la bande a pr\u00e9vues dans sa politique \u00e9taient plus que raisonnables. Elles offraient aux individus suffisamment de possibilit\u00e9s de se soumettre \u00e0 un autre test au cours de la saison de p\u00eache et, peu importe le r\u00e9sultat, ces individus pouvaient toujours se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau au test de d\u00e9pistage l'ann\u00e9e suivante.\n[116] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que la bande a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'adoption de la politique Apte au travail \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour qu'elle puisse atteindre ses objectifs en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la protection de ses employ\u00e9s contre les blessures et de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 contre les dommages. Il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait au troisi\u00e8me volet de l'analyse Meiorin. La bande s'est ainsi acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte de M. Dennis fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10 est rejet\u00e9e.\nVI. L'article 67 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne [117] Dans sa d\u00e9fense concernant la plainte, la bande a soutenu que sa politique Apte au travail \u00e9tait une mesure d'autonomie gouvernementale qu'elle exer\u00e7ait en vertu des dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle \u00e9tait exempt\u00e9e des dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 67. Comme j'ai rejet\u00e9 la plainte pour d'autres motifs, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'examiner cet argument.\nAthanasios D.

R\u00c9PARATIONS\nV. ORDONNANCE\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le 11 f\u00e9vrier 2004, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte H47521 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, lui demandant, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 49 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, d'instruire la plainte.\n[2] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, deux formulaires de plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au Tribunal. Le formulaire initial, dat\u00e9 du 13 mai 1998, indique \u00e0 partir de 1992 comme date de la conduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, tandis que le formulaire dat\u00e9 du 12 janvier 1999 et modifiant le formulaire du 13 mai 1998 indique \u00e0 partir de 1993 comme date de la conduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[3] Dans sa plainte, le plaignant, le Dr Shiv Chopra, qui, durant toutes les dates en cause, \u00e9tait \u00e9valuateur de m\u00e9dicaments \u00e0 la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la protection de la sant\u00e9, \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, affirme que Sant\u00e9 Canada a exerc\u00e9 une discrimination contre lui en le traitant d\u00e9favorablement dans son emploi, plus exactement en lui refusant des possibilit\u00e9s de promotion, \u00e0 cause de sa race, de sa couleur et de son origine nationale ou ethnique (il est originaire de l'Inde), contrevenant ainsi aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le dossier montre que le plaignant a plus tard affirm\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement et de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de Sant\u00e9 Canada, all\u00e9gations qui font entrer en jeu les articles 14 et 14.1 de la Loi.\n[4] La Commission n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'audience. Le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par leurs avocats.\n[5] Cette plainte soul\u00e8ve des questions de droit qui vont au-del\u00e0 d'un constat de discrimination selon les articles 7 et 10 de la Loi, et au-del\u00e0 d'un constat de harc\u00e8lement et de repr\u00e9sailles selon les articles 14 et 14.1 de la Loi.\n[6] Le dossier montre que, en 1992, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, une plainte portant sur des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui avaient eu lieu avant le 16 septembre 1992. Cette plainte fut d'abord instruite par une formation de trois membres de ce tribunal, le tribunal Soberman, lequel tira des conclusions de fait qui allaient au-del\u00e0 du 16 septembre 1992.\n[7] Le dossier montre que la d\u00e9cision rendue par le tribunal Soberman fut plus tard annul\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada, et qu'un autre membre du tribunal, M. Athanasios Hadjis, fut charg\u00e9 d'entendre des preuves nouvelles. Le tribunal Hadjis a tir\u00e9 des conclusions de fait sur des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui s'\u00e9taient produits apr\u00e8s le 16 septembre 1992 et tranch\u00e9 des questions qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es apr\u00e8s le 16 septembre 1992.\n[8] \u00c0 l'audience, l'objet de la plainte est devenu un point \u00e0 \u00e9claircir puisqu'il fallait savoir sur quelle p\u00e9riode portait la plainte. En outre, vu les conclusions et d\u00e9cisions du tribunal Soberman et du tribunal Hadjis, la question de l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e fut soulev\u00e9e puisqu'il fallait savoir quelles questions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par ces deux tribunaux.\n[9] Avant de s'interroger sur le fond de la plainte, c'est-\u00e0-dire sur la violation possible, par l'intim\u00e9, des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, ainsi que des articles 14 et 14.1 de la Loi, le Tribunal examinera un certain nombre de questions pr\u00e9liminaires qui pourraient influer sur la solution des questions de fond.\nII. LES QUESTIONS PR\u00c9LIMINAIRES [10] Avant d'examiner le fond de la plainte, il faut r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cinq questions pr\u00e9liminaires : A. l'objet de la plainte, B. les conclusions et d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux ant\u00e9rieurs, C. la carri\u00e8re du Dr Chopra \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, D. le traitement injuste r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au Dr Chopra \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada et E. la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du Dr Chopra.\nA. L'objet de la plainte [11] Le dossier montre que, le 13 mai 1998, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, un formulaire de plainte portant le num\u00e9ro H47521. Dans sa plainte initiale, le plaignant affirme que, \u00e0 partir de 1992, Sant\u00e9 Canada a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en le d\u00e9favorisant au cours de son emploi, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en lui refusant des possibilit\u00e9s de promotion, \u00e0 cause de sa race, de sa couleur et de son origine nationale ou ethnique, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[12] Le 12 janvier 1999, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me formulaire de plainte qui modifiait le formulaire de plainte sign\u00e9 le 13 mai 1998, portant le num\u00e9ro H47521. Dans le deuxi\u00e8me formulaire, le plaignant \u00e9crit que, \u00e0 partir de 1993, Sant\u00e9 Canada a exerc\u00e9 contre lui une discrimination en le d\u00e9favorisant au cours de son emploi, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en lui refusant des possibilit\u00e9s de promotion, \u00e0 cause de sa race, de sa couleur et de son origine nationale ou ethnique, contrevenant ainsi aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[13] \u00c0 l'audience, le plaignant a fait valoir que le formulaire modifi\u00e9 de plainte ne rempla\u00e7ait pas le formulaire initial, mais le modifiait par l'ajout de l'article 10 de la Loi comme motif additionnel de distinction illicite. Selon le plaignant, la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte restait la m\u00eame et cette p\u00e9riode d\u00e9butait en 1992.\n[14] L'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que la seconde plainte rempla\u00e7ait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re et que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte \u00e9tait celle qui d\u00e9butait en 1993. Il a aussi fait valoir que les incidents qui avaient eu lieu en 1992 avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s par des formations ant\u00e9rieures, \u00e0 savoir le tribunal Soberman et le tribunal Hadjis, et qu'ils ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre rejug\u00e9s.\n[15] Il se trouve que les deux formulaires de plainte, le formulaire initial dat\u00e9 du 13 mai 1998 et le formulaire modifi\u00e9 dat\u00e9 du 12 janvier 1999, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au Tribunal. La question de savoir ce qui a pu conduire le Dr Chopra \u00e0 signer un formulaire modifi\u00e9 de plainte et d'indiquer une autre date dans la case p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, devient donc th\u00e9orique; il en va de m\u00eame de la question de savoir si le formulaire modifi\u00e9 \u00e9tait ou non cens\u00e9 remplacer le formulaire initial. Comme je l'ai dit, les deux formulaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au Tribunal.\n[16] Par ailleurs, le dossier montre que, apr\u00e8s un long \u00e9change avec l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 au cours de son contre-interrogatoire, le plaignant a admis que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u00e9tait la p\u00e9riode allant de 1993 \u00e0 1999.\n[17] Le Tribunal estime donc qu'il est validement saisi des deux formulaires de plainte, \u00e0 savoir le formulaire initial et le formulaire modifi\u00e9, et que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte s'\u00e9tend de 1993 \u00e0 1999.\nB. Les conclusions et d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux ant\u00e9rieurs [18] Le dossier montre que plusieurs incidents mentionn\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente instance ont fait l'objet, de la part de formations ant\u00e9rieures, \u00e0 savoir le tribunal Soberman et le tribunal Hadjis, de conclusions et d\u00e9cisions se rapportant \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant contre l'intim\u00e9 le 16 septembre 1992, ainsi qu'\u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Sant\u00e9 Canada par l'Alliance de la capitale nationale sur les relations inter-raciales (l'ACNRI). Ainsi, le dossier montre que le tribunal Hadjis a admis des preuves et tir\u00e9 des conclusions se rapportant \u00e0 des incidents, notamment des incidents survenus en 1993 et 1994, qui en th\u00e9orie n'\u00e9taient pas vis\u00e9s par la plainte de 1992, laquelle portait sur des incidents n'allant pas au-del\u00e0 de septembre 1992.\n[19] Avant le d\u00e9but de la pr\u00e9sente audience, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate priant le Tribunal de radier certains aspects de la plainte, compte tenu des conclusions tir\u00e9es par M. Hadjis dans la d\u00e9cision Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), [2001] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 20 (QL), ainsi que dans la d\u00e9cision Alliance de la capitale nationale sur les relations inter-raciales c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), [1997] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 3 (QL). Le Tribunal s'est montr\u00e9 peu dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 supprimer certains aspects de la plainte. Cependant, il a examin\u00e9 diverses all\u00e9gations et rendu une s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions.\n[20] Le Tribunal estime qu'il est li\u00e9 par les conclusions et d\u00e9cisions de ses formations ant\u00e9rieures, notamment par celles des membres instructeurs suivants : Soberman, Sinclair, Hadjis et Groarke, et que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 des aspects ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9s et jug\u00e9s par d'autres membres instructeurs, ils ne peuvent \u00eatre rejug\u00e9s. Ils font cependant partie int\u00e9grante de l'historique du litige entre Dr Chopra et Sant\u00e9 Canada. Ils constituent la toile de fond de la plainte actuelle. Cela dit, m\u00eame s'ils constituent la toile de fond ou le contexte de la plainte actuelle, cela ne veut pas dire qu'il faut trancher \u00e0 nouveau des questions qui l'ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9.\n[21] Apr\u00e8s examen attentif des d\u00e9cisions Soberman et Hadjis, et compte tenu des points qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, le Tribunal croit devoir se pencher sur les incidents suivants pour savoir s'il convient de les inclure ou non dans les questions sur lesquelles il doit se prononcer : 1. la plainte Drennan, 2. les commentaires du Dr Liston, 3. l'incident Gunner, 4. la nomination du Dr Scott.\n(i) La plainte Drennan [22] Dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions annex\u00e9 \u00e0 sa plainte modifi\u00e9e, le plaignant \u00e9crit que, au cours de 1993 (sic), le Dr W.G. Drennan, le Dr M.S. Wong (sic), le Dr L. Ritter et un agent non d\u00e9sign\u00e9 des ressources humaines ont r\u00e9solu de le diffamer en lan\u00e7ant contre lui une accusation fallacieuse de n\u00e9gligence professionnelle. Selon le plaignant, l'accusation devait servir dans l'\u00e9valuation de son rendement et s'est sold\u00e9e par deux griefs et une enqu\u00eate externe. Le plaignant affirme aussi que, lorsque cela fut d\u00e9couvert, les auteurs de la diffamation n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9s et qu'on ne lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune excuse.\n[23] Le dossier montre que, dans sa d\u00e9cision de 2001, M. Hadjis s'est exprim\u00e9 sur la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le Dr Drennan contre le Dr Chopra en 1990. Selon le dossier, le Dr Chopra n'a eu connaissance de l'existence de la plainte qu'en 1993, \u00e0 la suite d'une demande d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'information qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[24] Au sujet de la plainte Drennan, le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, le 23 juillet 1990, le Dr Drennan, qui travaillait au Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre le Dr Chopra \u00e0 propos de la mise en circulation d'urgence d'un m\u00e9dicament. La plainte \u00e9tait inscrite dans une note de service adress\u00e9e au Dr Yong, chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e dans le dossier personnel du Dr Chopra. Selon la plainte, le Dr Drennan avait, le 11 juillet 1990, interpell\u00e9 le Dr Chopra au motif que celui-ci n'avait pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 promptement \u00e0 la mise en circulation d'un certain m\u00e9dicament destin\u00e9 \u00e0 traiter des volailles en Saskatchewan. Le dossier montre que le Dr Yong aurait conclu \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque que la plainte \u00e9tait sans fondement et que le Dr Chopra n'avait pas agi mal \u00e0 propos. Le Dr Yong n'avait donc pas, selon le dossier, donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la note de service, mais, malheureusement, celle-ci \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e dans le dossier du Dr Chopra. Plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s l'envoi de la note de service, le Dr Yong a inform\u00e9 le Dr Chopra de la plainte, durant la pr\u00e9paration de son \u00e9valuation de rendement de l'ann\u00e9e 1990-1991, mais le Dr Chopra ne savait apparemment pas que la note avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e dans son dossier personnel (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, paragraphe 144).\n[25] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, M. Hadjis \u00e9crit que l'inqui\u00e9tude du Dr Chopra par suite de cet incident, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il concernait la plainte dont il \u00e9tait saisi, tenait au fait que la dispute qui avait eu lieu entre lui et le Dr Drennan, en juillet 1990, \u00e9tait survenue seulement deux jours apr\u00e8s que le Dr Chopra eut fait parvenir au pr\u00e9sident de la Commission de la fonction publique une lettre, avec copie au sous-ministre Catley-Carlson, dans laquelle il lui faisait conna\u00eetre ses pr\u00e9occupations au regard de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi dans la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, ainsi que sa frustration caus\u00e9e par le fait que ni Sant\u00e9 Canada ni aucun autre organisme public ne l'avaient pressenti pour un poste de cadre (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, paragraphe 146).\n[26] Au sujet des pr\u00e9occupations du Dr Chopra, M. Hadjis a jug\u00e9 que, hormis le court intervalle entre les deux \u00e9v\u00e9nements, rien ne semblait \u00e9tablir de lien entre eux, et il a relev\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau que le tribunal Soberman n'avait nullement \u00e9voqu\u00e9 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans sa d\u00e9cision. M. Hadjis a alors rejet\u00e9 l'id\u00e9e qu'une discrimination \u00e0 l'encontre du Dr Chopra f\u00fbt \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte du Dr Drennan ou que cette plainte f\u00fbt li\u00e9e aux plaintes du Dr Chopra et \u00e0 ses accusations de discrimination (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, paragraphe 290).\n[27] Le Tribunal estime que les questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte Drennan ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es \u00e0 fond par le tribunal Hadjis. L'avocat du plaignant a reconnu au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instance que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le Dr Drennan en 1990, plainte dont l'existence a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverte en d\u00e9cembre 1993, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'une d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis. Au reste, dans la d\u00e9cision qu'il a rendue dans l'affaire Bassude c. Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2005 TCDP 21, paragraphe 11, le membre instructeur Groarke a soulign\u00e9 que les parties \u00e9taient li\u00e9es par les conclusions de M. Hadjis.\n[28] Le Tribunal ne revisitera donc pas les questions, conclusions et d\u00e9cisions se rapportant \u00e0 la plainte Drennan ni ne tirera d'autres conclusions de fait, notamment sur les questions suivantes : ladite plainte a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e en repr\u00e9sailles au rapport du Dr Chopra sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi? S'agissait-il d'une tentative de Sant\u00e9 Canada de discr\u00e9diter le Dr Chopra? \u00c9tait-elle ou non le signe d'une attitude raciste de la direction, ainsi que l'affirme l'avocat du plaignant? Enfin, quelles auraient pu \u00eatre les raisons de la direction, \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, de ne pas informer le Dr Chopra de l'existence de la plainte et de ne pas se prononcer sur la plainte? Les conclusions (ou non-conclusions) tir\u00e9es par M. Hadjis dans sa d\u00e9cision concernant la plainte Drennan sont toutes aujourd'hui chose jug\u00e9e.\n(ii) Les commentaires du Dr Liston [29] Le dossier montre que les commentaires formul\u00e9s par le Dr Liston \u00e0 propos du Dr Chopra en septembre 1992, commentaires qui sont reproduits dans une note r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par Mme Shirley Cuddihy, appel\u00e9e la note Cuddihy, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s par le tribunal Hadjis.\n[30] Il ressort de la d\u00e9cision Hadjis que, en septembre 1992, le sous-ministre de Sant\u00e9 Canada avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Direction des ressources humaines l'avis de la haute direction sur les raisons pour lesquelles le Dr Chopra n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 promu \u00e0 un poste de direction, et Mme Shirley Cuddihy, chef des relations de travail et op\u00e9rations \u00e0 la Direction des ressources humaines, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e de r\u00e9diger l'avis.\n[31] Le dossier montre que Mme Cuddihy avait rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Liston, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque sous-ministre adjoint de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la protection de la sant\u00e9, et que le Dr Liston avait fait les commentaires suivants, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans la note de service que Mme Cuddihy a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 son surveillant, M. Rod Ballantyne :\n[traduction]\nComme promis, voici les notes que j'ai prises lors de mes conversations avec les Drs Liston et Somers.\nLe Dr Liston a \u00e9mis \u00e0 la fois des commentaires de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des commentaires portant particuli\u00e8rement sur S. Chopra.\nG\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s :\nLes employ\u00e9s que l'on pressent uniquement pour des postes de nature technique semblent mieux s'en tirer que lorsqu'on les pressent pour des postes de gestion. Les diff\u00e9rences culturelles sont r\u00e9duites au minimum lorsqu'il est uniquement question de la d\u00e9marche scientifique. Toutefois, lorsqu'on se met \u00e0 examiner les comp\u00e9tences non techniques comme l'aptitude \u00e0 communiquer, \u00e0 influencer, \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier, tr\u00e8s souvent, leur patrimoine culturel n'a pas mis l'accent sur ces questions et ces gens sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s.\nLa capacit\u00e9 d'interagir avec divers intervenants comme les repr\u00e9sentants de l'industrie, de m\u00eame que sur le plan interne avec les coll\u00e8gues, les subordonn\u00e9s et les sup\u00e9rieurs, est importante. En outre, nous faisons des affaires \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on nord-am\u00e9ricaine : nous appliquons le mod\u00e8le consensuel, qui est tr\u00e8s \u00e9tranger \u00e0 certaines cultures.\nIl semble que le Dr Liston ait eu un certain nombre d'entretiens avec Ivy Williams \u00e0 ce sujet. Il y a cependant un l\u00e9ger paradoxe dans le fait de mettre l'accent sur ce qu'il faut \u00e0 notre avis changer, parce que nous courons le risque d'avoir \u00e0 nous d\u00e9fendre contre des accusations d'assimilation. Il affirme que nous devons offrir une formation aux membres des groupes minoritaires - nous devons leur pr\u00e9senter un miroir, et leur dire : \u00c0 cause de votre origine culturelle, vous devez mieux communiquer pour en venir \u00e0 adopter un style moins autoritaire. Ce n'est pas un probl\u00e8me de couleur, mais bien de culture, et ce n'est pas un probl\u00e8me de la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ni m\u00eame du Minist\u00e8re, mais cela semble se produire le plus souvent dans des minist\u00e8res comme le n\u00f4tre qui sont \u00e0 vocation technique ou scientifique.\nD\u00e9tails relatifs \u00e0 S. Chopra.\nIl est autoritaire.\nIl voyait dans [Shiv Chopra] une grande connaissance th\u00e9orique et pensait qu'il avait avantage \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir des comp\u00e9tences non techniques. [Shiv Chopra] avait un style port\u00e9 \u00e0 l'affrontement dont les effets ne se sont manifest\u00e9s que quelque temps apr\u00e8s son affectation au poste de consultation rattach\u00e9 au Dr Liston. Apr\u00e8s un certain temps, les gens pr\u00e9f\u00e9raient l'\u00e9viter plut\u00f4t que de se voir pris \u00e0 partie par lui.\n[Shiv Chopra] n'est pas un n\u00e9gociateur - il ne se fait pas d'alli\u00e9s facilement.\nIl ne s'est pas plac\u00e9 dans une situation qui le pr\u00e9parerait \u00e0 occuper des postes au niveau de la haute direction.\n[32] Le dossier montre que la note Cuddihy n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque au Dr Chopra. Le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de son existence et en a obtenu une copie \u00e0 la suite d'une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'information. Le dossier montre que M. Hadjis s'est exprim\u00e9 longuement sur les commentaires faits par le Dr Liston en 1992 et a tir\u00e9 des conclusions de fait, de m\u00eame que certains enseignements, sur l'incidence de ces commentaires sur la carri\u00e8re du Dr Chopra.\n[33] En ce qui a trait de la note Cuddihy, le tribunal Hadjis a estim\u00e9 que l'on pouvait raisonnablement d\u00e9duire des opinions exprim\u00e9es par le sous-ministre adjoint, dans la note Cuddihy, qu'un lien avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli entre les d\u00e9cisions prises par l'intim\u00e9 portant sur la nomination au poste de directeur et un motif de distinction illicite (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, paragraphe 269). Le tribunal Hadjis a aussi estim\u00e9 que la note Cuddihy rendait compte exactement de la substance de la conversation de Mme Cuddihy avec le Dr Liston et que les propos du Dr Liston montraient qu'il tenait fondamentalement pour acquis que les personnes de culture diff\u00e9rente n'ont peut-\u00eatre pas les aptitudes n\u00e9cessaires pour occuper un poste de haute direction, et cela parce que, dans leur culture, on n'a pas mis l'accent sur leurs comp\u00e9tences comportementales, telles que la communication, la persuasion et la n\u00e9gociation, ce qui jouerait contre elles (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, paragraphes 269 et 272).\n[34] Le tribunal Hadjis a conclu que les remarques du Dr Liston visaient de toute \u00e9vidence les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles travaillant \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, dont les origines nationales ou ethniques sont vari\u00e9es, y compris les personnes originaires de l'Asie du Sud comme le Dr Chopra (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, paragraphe 271). Selon M. Hadjis, les commentaires formul\u00e9s par le Dr Liston au sujet du Dr Chopra rendaient compte de sa perception selon laquelle ce dernier comptait parmi les employ\u00e9s issus des minorit\u00e9s visibles qui n'avaient pas les comp\u00e9tences comportementales n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 un bon gestionnaire (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, paragraphe 275).\n[35] Le Tribunal ne revisitera donc pas les questions, conclusions et d\u00e9cisions se rapportant \u00e0 la note Cuddihy, ni ne tirera de conclusions factuelles additionnelles, notamment sur les aspects suivants : Sant\u00e9 Canada a-t-il ou non pris les mesures qu'il fallait \u00e0 l'endroit du Dr Liston? La conduite des gestionnaires de Sant\u00e9 Canada traduit-elle ou non une attitude raciste de la direction? Toutes les conclusions (ou non-conclusions) tir\u00e9es par M. Hadjis dans sa d\u00e9cision et portant sur la note Cuddihy sont chose jug\u00e9e et ne peuvent \u00eatre remises en cause devant le Tribunal. Statuer autrement signifierait que des parties qui ne sont pas satisfaites de la d\u00e9cision d'un tribunal pourraient, \u00e0 loisir, faire rejuger tel ou tel aspect \u00e0 l'infini. Cela est contraire \u00e0 la bonne administration de la justice.\n(iii) L'incident Gunner [36] M\u00eame si l'incident Gunner ne faisait pas partie de l'objet de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le Dr Chopra en septembre 1992, le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le tribunal Hadjis s'est prononc\u00e9 sur cet incident.\n[37] Dans sa d\u00e9cision de 2001, M. Hadjis s'est exprim\u00e9 ainsi sur l'incident Gunner :\nParagraphe 143\nLe Dr Chopra a soutenu que le Dr Gunner avait fait en 1993 un commentaire diffamatoire \u00e0 son endroit, apr\u00e8s qu'il eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne; il consid\u00e8re cet incident comme une preuve circonstancielle suppl\u00e9mentaire de l'[Traduction] attitude raciste de la direction, derri\u00e8re des portes closes. Apparemment, quelque temps apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de faire relever le Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires de la Direction des aliments, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le Dr Gunner, a rencontr\u00e9 le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical de l'IPFPC, D.R. Casorso; \u00e0 cette occasion, il s'est enquis de l'existence de [Traduction] probl\u00e8mes syndicaux au Bureau. Durant cet entretien, le Dr Gunner a pos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Casorso des questions au sujet de l'affaire Chopra. (Qu'en est-il de Shiv Chopra?) Lors d'une r\u00e9union subs\u00e9quente \u00e0 laquelle ont particip\u00e9 plusieurs membres du syndicat, M. Casorso a fait \u00e9tat des points abord\u00e9s lors de cette discussion et notamment de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au plaignant. Le Dr Chopra s'est offusqu\u00e9 du fait qu'on n'ait pas abord\u00e9 directement avec lui les questions qui le concernaient; par cons\u00e9quent, il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief demandant qu'on juge [Traduction] inconvenante la conduite du Dr Gunner \u00e0 son endroit. M. Casorso lui ayant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses excuses, le Dr Chopra a ult\u00e9rieurement retir\u00e9 son grief [Traduction] en signe de bonne foi.\nParagraphe 289\nEn outre, aucune preuve n'\u00e9taie la pr\u00e9tention du Dr Chopra voulant que la discrimination ait jou\u00e9 dans l'incident de 1993 mettant en cause un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical, voire m\u00eame qu'on ait exerc\u00e9 contre lui des repr\u00e9sailles en raison des plaintes qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 l'encontre de l'intim\u00e9. Certes, les questions soulev\u00e9es par le Dr Chopra et d'autres fonctionnaires, par l'entremise de l'ACNRI, avaient \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 cr\u00e9\u00e9 certaines frictions entre ces employ\u00e9s et leurs employeurs. Dans ce contexte, il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inopportun qu'un directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral nouvellement nomm\u00e9 fasse enqu\u00eate sur ces questions ou m\u00eame qualifie ces diff\u00e9rends de probl\u00e8me. C'est l\u00e0 une autre question \u00e0 propos de laquelle le tribunal Soberman n'a pas tir\u00e9 de conclusions.\n[38] Le dossier montre que le tribunal Hadjis s'est exprim\u00e9 en profondeur sur l'incident Gunner et a tir\u00e9 des conclusions que le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal ne saurait ignorer. Cette affaire est \u00e0 toutes fins utiles chose jug\u00e9e et le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal ne s'y attardera pas davantage, si ce n'est dans le contexte de la plainte actuelle. Le Tribunal rel\u00e8ve ici que le tribunal Hadjis a conclu que la conduite du Dr Gunner n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoire.\n(iv) La nomination du Dr Scott [39] M\u00eame si la nomination du Dr Scott au poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires ne faisait pas partie de l'objet de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le Dr Chopra en septembre 1992, le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le tribunal Hadjis a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la question.\n[40] Les paragraphes suivants de la d\u00e9cision Hadjis doivent \u00eatre reproduits pour bien faire ressortir les conclusions et d\u00e9cisions de M. Hadjis au regard de la nomination Scott :\nParagraphe 136\nDans sa plainte, le Dr Chopra a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 injustement en raison de la mani\u00e8re dont ses \u00e9valuations de rendement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies durant la p\u00e9riode 1990-1992. \u00c0 son avis, ce traitement dont il a fait l'objet est attribuable \u00e0 sa couleur, \u00e0 race et \u00e0 son origine nationale ou ethnique. Dans sa plaidoirie finale, l'avocat de la Commission a \u00e9galement fait \u00e9tat d'un autre concours tenu en 1993, ainsi que d'un incident mettant en cause un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical et d'un grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre le plaignant apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne, afin de d\u00e9montrer le caract\u00e8re permanent du traitement discriminatoire. Je ferai remarquer qu'\u00e0 part la question des \u00e9valuations de rendement, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision du tribunal Soberman, et ce m\u00eame si tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui s'y rattachent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le cadre de la premi\u00e8re audience.\nParagraphe 141\nEn d\u00e9cembre 1993, le Dr Chopra s'est port\u00e9 candidat au poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, classifi\u00e9 au niveau EX-02. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a dit avoir vu l'avis annon\u00e7ant ce concours avant de pr\u00e9senter sa candidature. Le jury de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection a rejet\u00e9 sa candidature pour le motif qu'il ne satisfaisait pas \u00e0 deux des trois facteurs d'exp\u00e9rience mentionn\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s : i) exp\u00e9rience dans la gestion d'un organisme scientifique, m\u00e9dical ou v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire dont les programmes sont polyvalents; et ii) exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant minist\u00e9riel aupr\u00e8s d'organismes ext\u00e9rieurs, y compris les m\u00e9dias et les organismes internationaux. En ce qui concerne le premier crit\u00e8re, on a jug\u00e9 que son exp\u00e9rience n'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9cente, comme l'exigeait le guide de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection \u00e9labor\u00e9 par le jury de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. Pour ce qui est du deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re, on a estim\u00e9 que rien ne d\u00e9montrait qu'il avait eu de l'exp\u00e9rience sur le plan des relations avec les m\u00e9dias \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant de Sant\u00e9 Canada. On a jug\u00e9 que le Dr Timothy Scott \u00e9tait le seul candidat parfaitement comp\u00e9tent, et c'est lui qui a obtenu le poste.\nParagraphe 142\nLe Dr Chopra en a appel\u00e9 (sic) de la nomination, all\u00e9guant que ses comp\u00e9tences et celles du Dr T. Scott n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 bien \u00e9valu\u00e9es. Le 14 novembre 1994, Mme Helen Barkley, du Comit\u00e9 d'appel de la Commission de la fonction publique, a rejet\u00e9 l'appel. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, Mme Barkley a conclu que c'est \u00e0 titre de simple citoyen et non \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant minist\u00e9riel, que le Dr Chopra avait eu des rapports avec les m\u00e9dias, et que, de toute fa\u00e7on, ces rapports avec eu trait \u00e0 des questions sociales. Donc, [Traduction] il ne poss\u00e9dait pas l'exp\u00e9rience de gestion qu'exigeait le poste. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait d\u00e9cel\u00e9 aucune preuve de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 de la part de l'un ou l'autre des membres du jury de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, Mme Francine Krueger, de la CFP, et le Dr Saul Gunner, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Direction des aliments, dont faisait partie le Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires.\nParagraphe 288\nPar ailleurs, le Dr Chopra n'a pas \u00e0 mon avis fait l'objet d'un traitement d\u00e9favorable dans le cadre du concours tenu en d\u00e9cembre 1993 pour doter le poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires. Bien que sa candidature ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection en raison de son manque d'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion, on a \u00e9galement jug\u00e9 qu'il ne r\u00e9pondait pas au deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re sur le plan de l'exp\u00e9rience, \u00e0 savoir les relations avec les organismes externes. On n'a produit aucune preuve indiquant que le Dr Chopra satisfaisait en fait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re ou que le fait qu'il ne poss\u00e9dait pas cette exp\u00e9rience \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 un comportement discriminatoire de la part de l'intim\u00e9. Je suis convaincu que le Dr Chopra n'\u00e9tait pas comp\u00e9tent pour le poste et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le crit\u00e8re Shakes n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait.\n[41] Dans la d\u00e9cision Bassude c. Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2005 TCDP 21, le membre instructeur Groarke a estim\u00e9, s'agissant de la nomination Scott, que la question avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e.\n[42] \u00c0 l'audience, l'avocat du plaignant a fait valoir cependant que le tribunal Hadjis n'avait pas examin\u00e9 ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite des mesures correctives qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9es quand le Dr Casorso a obtenu gain de cause dans son appel, et il a pri\u00e9 le Tribunal d'\u00e9tudier la question. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cet argument, l'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que toute la question de la nomination du Dr Scott \u00e9tait maintenant chose jug\u00e9e, affirmant que les faits \u00e9taient essentiellement les m\u00eames dans les deux cas (concours initial et concours ult\u00e9rieur). Le plaignant a ni\u00e9 que la question f\u00fbt chose jug\u00e9e, parce que les points litigieux n'\u00e9taient pas les m\u00eames, m\u00eame si les faits \u00e9taient sans doute les m\u00eames.\n[43] Le dossier montre que, le 3 mars 2006, une formation du Tribunal a statu\u00e9 sur une objection formelle \u00e9lev\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre du d\u00e9p\u00f4t, par le plaignant, de preuves int\u00e9ressant le processus de s\u00e9lection qui avait conduit \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Timothy Scott au poste de directeur, BMV (Basudde c. Sant\u00e9 Canada), 2006 TCDP 10 :\n[28] Cela dit, le Tribunal ne peut cependant pas omettre de tenir compte du fait que M. Hadjis dans sa d\u00e9cision a effectivement tir\u00e9 des conclusions de fait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations de discrimination se rapportant \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus \u00e0 un moment autre que durant la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 1992, \u00e0 savoir la nomination du Dr Scott au poste de directeur, BMV.\n[29] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, M. Hadjis a conclu que le Dr Chopra n'avait pas fait l'objet d'un traitement qui l'avait d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 dans le cadre du concours de d\u00e9cembre 1993 visant \u00e0 doter le poste de directeur, BMV. M. Hadjis a, en outre, conclu qu'il n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni aucune preuve indiquant que le Dr Chopra avait, en fait, l'exp\u00e9rience requise pour traiter avec des organismes externes (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, au paragraphe 288). Sur cette base, M. Hadjis a conclu que le Dr Chopra n'avait pas les comp\u00e9tences requises pour occuper le poste et qu'il n'y avait aucune preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[30] M\u00eame si on peut dire que ces conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es par M. Hadjis ne sont qu'accessoires \u00e0 la question fondamentale qu'il devait trancher, c'est-\u00e0-dire la dotation du poste de directeur, BMHP, je ne peux omettre d'en tenir compte.\n[...]\n[33] Le Tribunal conclut par cons\u00e9quent ce qui suit : La p\u00e9riode trait\u00e9e par la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra \u00e9tait la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 1992, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment jusqu'au 16 septembre 1992, date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. La dotation du poste de directeur, BMHP, \u00e9tait au cur de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992. Des all\u00e9gations additionnelles de discrimination ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es au cours de la deuxi\u00e8me audience tenue par M. Hadjis \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992, notamment des all\u00e9gations de discrimination se rapportant au processus de s\u00e9lection de d\u00e9cembre 1993 qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Scott au poste de directeur, BMV. Ces all\u00e9gations, m\u00eame si elles \u00e9taient accessoires et ne faisaient pas partie de la port\u00e9e de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992, ont amen\u00e9 M. Hadjis \u00e0 tirer certaines conclusions de fait. Le Tribunal ne peut pas omettre de tenir compte de ces conclusions, mais elles doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es dans le contexte de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 et de l'analyse effectu\u00e9e par M. Hadjis \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du concours de d\u00e9cembre 1993.\n[34] Dans son analyse de la preuve se rapportant au concours de 1993 (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, aux paragraphes 141 et 142), M. Hadjis a pris en compte seulement les faits se rapportant au concours initial. Il n'a pas trait\u00e9 des mesures correctives qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en application apr\u00e8s que M. Casorso eut gain de cause dans son appel. Il n'a pas trait\u00e9 non plus des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s la mise en application de ces mesures correctives ni de toute all\u00e9gation de discrimination se rapportant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont suivi la mise en application des mesures correctives.\n[35] Le Tribunal conclut, par cons\u00e9quent, que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s qu'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue la d\u00e9cision du CACFP en novembre 1994 n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en compte par M. Hadjis et que ce dernier n'a pas rendu une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Ses conclusions de fait se limitent au concours initial de 1993 et ne traitent pas de l'ensemble du processus se rapportant \u00e0 la dotation du poste de directeur, BMV.\n[36] Sur ce point, le Tribunal ne souscrit pas \u00e0 l'affirmation de l'intim\u00e9 selon laquelle les mesures correctives mises en application apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision Casorso sont incluses dans l'ensemble du processus de s\u00e9lection d'un directeur du BMV, processus qui a d\u00e9but\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 1993 et qui s'est termin\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 1995 par la confirmation du Dr Scott au poste de directeur, BMV.\n[44] Vu cette d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure sur la question de la nomination du Dr Scott, le Tribunal examinera, comme partie int\u00e9grante de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, les incidents survenus \u00e0 la suite des mesures correctives qui furent ordonn\u00e9es apr\u00e8s que le Dr Carsoso eut obtenu gain de cause dans son appel.\nC. La carri\u00e8re du Dr Chopra \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada [45] Le Dr Chopra est originaire de l'Inde. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada en 1969. En 1987, il est devenu \u00e9valuateur de m\u00e9dicaments \u00e0 la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, au niveau VM-4. Son emploi \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada a pris fin en 2004.\n[46] Le dossier montre que, durant son emploi \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, le Dr Chopra a occup\u00e9 deux fois des postes int\u00e9rimaires, en 1988 et en 1996. La premi\u00e8re fois, selon la preuve, le Dr Chopra a occup\u00e9 \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, en 1988, durant environ six semaines, avant que le Dr Yong ne f\u00fbt nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 ce poste, puis ensuite, par intervalles, lorsqu'on le lui demandait, jusqu'en 1992 environ. La deuxi\u00e8me fois, selon la preuve, le Dr Chopra a occup\u00e9 \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le poste de chef de la Division du syst\u00e8me nerveux central et des m\u00e9dicaments endocriniens durant une p\u00e9riode de quatre mois \u00e0 la fin de 1996 et au d\u00e9but de 1997 (du 7 octobre 1996 au 7 f\u00e9vrier 1997) et que, en tant que chef de cette division, il agissait \u00e0 l'occasion, durant quelques jours ici et l\u00e0, comme directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires.\n[47] Appel\u00e9 \u00e0 dire si quelqu'un au sein du minist\u00e8re avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9mis des doutes sur son rendement lorsqu'il a occup\u00e9 \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire, \u00e0 quelques reprises, le poste de chef ou de directeur, le Dr Chopra a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'en \u00e9tait rien, que personne, au sein du minist\u00e8re ou en dehors, ne s'\u00e9tait plaint \u00e0 son sujet lorsqu'il a agi comme directeur ou chef.\n[48] Le dossier montre que, d\u00e8s 1979, le Dr Chopra s'\u00e9tait montr\u00e9 d\u00e9sireux d'avoir des occasions d'acqu\u00e9rir une exp\u00e9rience de la gestion \u00e0 des niveaux plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s. Ses \u00e9valuations annuelles, avant qu'il n'int\u00e8gre le Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, et alors qu'il travaillait au Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments, mentionnent que des programmes de formation \u00e0 la gestion sont recommand\u00e9s pour cet employ\u00e9 afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses aspirations professionnelles et qu'il avait re\u00e7u une formation approfondie en gestion.\n[49] Les observations suivantes apparaissent dans son \u00e9valuation de 1979, sign\u00e9e par le Dr Ian Henderson : [TRADUCTION] Il est \u00e9vident que cet employ\u00e9 consid\u00e8re que son avenir se trouve dans les domaines de l'\u00e9laboration de politiques et de la gestion. Il agit de facto comme chef de section pour la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 de l'immunologie, mais ceci n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli formellement dans sa description de t\u00e2ches, ni dans sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Il est quelque peu frustr\u00e9 par son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 progresser au sein de la structure de direction de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la protection de la sant\u00e9 et, \u00e0 l'heure actuelle, il est \u00e0 la recherche d'une occasion de s'engager sur la voie d'une carri\u00e8re de gestionnaire, tout en tentant de maintenir son expertise dans la discipline scientifique de l'immunologie.\n[50] Dans son \u00e9valuation de l'ann\u00e9e 1980-1981, il est \u00e9crit que le Dr Chopra a re\u00e7u une formation approfondie en gestion, tandis que son \u00e9valuation de 1981-1982 mentionne qu'il a acquis une formation approfondie en gestion.\n[51] Dans le cadre de son \u00e9valuation de 1981-1982, il est mentionn\u00e9 que cet employ\u00e9 a re\u00e7u une formation approfondie en techniques de gestion, notamment un dipl\u00f4me en perfectionnement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de la Commission de la fonction publique et que son plein potentiel reste sous-utilis\u00e9, que, en d\u00e9pit d'une formation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re approfondie et d'une exp\u00e9rience des syst\u00e8mes de gestion et en d\u00e9pit d'une connaissance intime du contr\u00f4le r\u00e9glementaire international des produits de soins de sant\u00e9, aucun avancement professionnel v\u00e9ritable n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible. N\u00e9anmoins, l'employ\u00e9 a pu ma\u00eetriser sa frustration et il continue de montrer de l'initiative et de l'\u00e9nergie comme il sied \u00e0 un professionnel. Ces observations sont r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es dans son \u00e9valuation de 1982-1983.\n[52] Dans son \u00e9valuation de 1986-1987, il est \u00e9crit que, lorsque l'occasion lui en est donn\u00e9e, le Dr Chopra se comporte en gestionnaire comp\u00e9tent. Dans son avant-derni\u00e8re \u00e9valuation annuelle avant qu'il n'int\u00e8gre le Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, celle de 1987-1988, il est \u00e9crit que le Dr Chopra poss\u00e8de une vaste exp\u00e9rience des affaires de r\u00e9glementation et a prouv\u00e9 son aptitude \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les situations d\u00e9licates qui requi\u00e8rent \u00e0 la fois des connaissances scientifiques, du tact et des comp\u00e9tences en \u00e9criture, qu'il pourrait obtenir un avancement \u00e0 un niveau sup\u00e9rieur au sein du service et que ses aspirations devraient \u00eatre prises en compte. Dans son \u00e9valuation de l990, sign\u00e9e par les Drs Yong et Messier, il est \u00e9crit que le Dr Chopra a la capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser ses aspirations professionnelles (postes de direction). On l'encourage \u00e0 participer au Programme d'affectations minist\u00e9rielles. Ses \u00e9valuations ult\u00e9rieures sont moins d\u00e9taill\u00e9es.\n[53] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, en 1991, le Dr Chopra avait de nouveau manifest\u00e9, \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sentants de Sant\u00e9 Canada, M. Ballantyne et le Dr Liston, son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour des occasions d'acqu\u00e9rir une exp\u00e9rience de la gestion \u00e0 des niveaux sup\u00e9rieurs. La preuve montre que le Dr Chopra s'\u00e9tait dit pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que, selon lui, on lui refusait cette possibilit\u00e9. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, il a exprim\u00e9 l'avis que le minist\u00e8re offrait cette possibilit\u00e9 (c'est-\u00e0-dire l'exp\u00e9rience de la gestion hi\u00e9rarchique) \u00e0 tout le monde sauf \u00e0 lui.\n[54] Le Dr Chopra a dit \u00e0 maintes reprises, durant son t\u00e9moignage, qu'il r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 toutes les conditions requises pour un poste de direction et que, \u00e0 son avis, vu ses \u00e9valuations ant\u00e9rieures, il \u00e9tait plus \u00e0 m\u00eame que n'importe qui d'autre d'occuper des postes de direction, c'est-\u00e0-dire des postes de chef ou de directeur. La preuve montre que le Dr Chopra s'\u00e9tait laiss\u00e9 dire, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, qu'il lui fallait une exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente de la gestion hi\u00e9rarchique.\n[55] Il convient de noter, \u00e0 propos de l'avancement professionnel du Dr Chopra, que M. Hadjis a tir\u00e9 les conclusions suivantes dans sa d\u00e9cision de 2001 :\n[261] Le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que, au cours de cette m\u00eame p\u00e9riode (1969-1987), il n'a pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de la part de son employeur des conseils et de l'aide qui lui auraient permis d'acqu\u00e9rir l'exp\u00e9rience en gestion n\u00e9cessaire pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 un poste de gestion sup\u00e9rieur. D\u00e8s 1974, on a conseill\u00e9 au Dr Chopra de s'inscrire \u00e0 des programmes de perfectionnement professionnel tels que le CAP; plus tard, on lui a conseill\u00e9 de s'inscrire au PAM. La preuve montre que le plaignant n'a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 ces recommandations.\n[262] Le tribunal Soberman a conclu que de telles responsabilit\u00e9s ne peuvent \u00eatre laiss\u00e9es totalement \u00e0 la seule attention de l'employ\u00e9 dans une bureaucratie aussi grande et que l'insensibilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 a aggrav\u00e9 la frustration du Dr Chopra et, en fin de compte, a fait na\u00eetre chez lui des soup\u00e7ons quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 que la discrimination raciale ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le fait qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ignor\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, le premier tribunal a jug\u00e9 que ces conclusions ne permettaient pas d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Toutefois, j'ajouterai que les nouvelles preuves qui m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ont \u00e9tay\u00e9 l'argument voulant que, en fin de compte, c'est \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 qu'il incombe de chercher et d'obtenir de telles occasions de formation et d'avancement. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime qu'on ne peut \u00e0 partir de ces circonstances conclure qu'il y a eu discrimination de la part de l'intim\u00e9.\nD. Le traitement injuste r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au Dr Chopra [56] Au soutien des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles le plaignant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, l'avocat du plaignant a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 plusieurs cas o\u00f9, affirme-t-il, Sant\u00e9 Canada l'a trait\u00e9 injustement par comparaison avec d'autres employ\u00e9s de Sant\u00e9 Canada. Dans ses conclusions, l'avocat du plaignant affirmait que ces cas devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des cas allant au-del\u00e0 du traitement injuste dont le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime par rapport \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s, pour englober les repr\u00e9sailles ou le harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[57] Vu que le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas examiner les incidents ou aspects qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par des formations ant\u00e9rieures, les incidents qui, selon le Tribunal, int\u00e9ressent la pr\u00e9sente instance sont 1. la plainte Zohair, 2. la plainte Elanco, 3. la suspension impos\u00e9e au Dr Chopra par le Dr Lachance en 1999, 4. l'exclusion du Dr Chopra de certains projets.\n[58] \u00c0 l'exception de la plainte Elanco, la plainte Zohair, la suspension du Dr Chopra et son exclusion de certains projets ne sont pas indiqu\u00e9es comme des cas de discrimination dans les formulaires de plainte ni dans les all\u00e9gations additionnelles, la plainte Zohair et la suspension du Dr Chopra \u00e9tant post\u00e9rieures au d\u00e9p\u00f4t des formulaires de plaintes et des all\u00e9gations additionnelles en juin 1999.\n(i) La plainte Zohair [59] Le dossier montre que, en juillet 1999, Mme Shaida Zohair, secr\u00e9taire du chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, o\u00f9 le Dr Chopra travaillait comme \u00e9valuateur, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 l'encontre du Dr Chopra. Sant\u00e9 Canada a ordonn\u00e9 l'ouverture d'une enqu\u00eate ind\u00e9pendante. L'enqu\u00eateur a conclu que le Dr Chopra s'\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre rendu coupable d'arrogance, d'insensibilit\u00e9 ou de comportement condescendant, mais ni la fr\u00e9quence - trois incidents seulement sur une p\u00e9riode d'un an - ni la nature - ils n'\u00e9taient ni importants ni graves - des actes commis n'attestaient un comportement pouvant constituer du harc\u00e8lement. Selon la preuve, le Dr Chopra s'est vu imposer une r\u00e9primande par le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Direction des aliments et qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief contre cette d\u00e9cision. La preuve montre aussi que le grief du Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par le sous-ministre adjoint, qui a ordonn\u00e9 que la lettre de r\u00e9primande soit enlev\u00e9e du dossier du Dr Chopra.\n[60] L'avocat du plaignant a dit, dans ses conclusions orales, que, s'il avait \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la plainte Zohair, c'\u00e9tait pour deux raisons pr\u00e9cises : d'abord, pour montrer comment le Dr Chopra avait eu connaissance de la plainte - la plainte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en juillet 1999 et le Dr Chopra n'en a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 qu'en septembre 1999 - et ensuite pour montrer comment les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre le Dr Chopra \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par rapport aux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par lui.\n[61] \u00c0 ce sujet, la preuve montre que le Dr Chopra a eu connaissance de la plainte par l'entremise de l'enqu\u00eateur. Il semble que personne au sein du minist\u00e8re ne l'en avait inform\u00e9. Aucune explication n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e de cette omission. La preuve montre aussi que le Dr Chopra avait le droit d'\u00eatre inform\u00e9 de la plainte aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n[62] Dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance, le Tribunal ne saurait tirer de cet incident davantage que les constatations suivantes : le minist\u00e8re a fait enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, une r\u00e9primande a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e contre le Dr Chopra puis celui-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief contre la r\u00e9primande et a obtenu gain de cause. Vu les conclusions de l'avocat du plaignant, le Tribunal devra examiner si la plainte Zohair constitue des repr\u00e9sailles ou du harc\u00e8lement de la part de Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[63] Plus troublante cependant est l'affirmation que le Dr Chopra a faite au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, lorsqu'il a dit que la plainte de Mme Zohair avait \u00e9t\u00e9 maniganc\u00e9e par le minist\u00e8re, c'est-\u00e0-dire que le minist\u00e8re avait incit\u00e9 Mme Zohair \u00e0 entrer en conflit avec lui. Cette affirmation est rest\u00e9e tout au long de l'audience une all\u00e9gation non prouv\u00e9e qui, de ce fait, mine la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant au regard de certaines de ses affirmations.\n(ii) La plainte Elanco [64] Dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions annex\u00e9 \u00e0 sa plainte modifi\u00e9e, le plaignant \u00e9crit que, au d\u00e9but de 1997, il a encore une fois fait l'objet de calomnies et de diffamation de la part des Drs G. Paterson et D. Landry, qui l'ont accus\u00e9 faussement d'avoir manifest\u00e9 un comportement inacceptable envers Elanco, une entreprise pharmaceutique, lors d'une r\u00e9union du BMV. Les accusations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies d'une plainte reconventionnelle et d'une menace de poursuites judiciaires, le plaignant ajoutant qu'aucune sanction n'a, encore une fois, \u00e9t\u00e9 prise contre les auteurs des fausses accusations.\n[65] L'incident Elanco a pour origine une lettre envoy\u00e9e par le repr\u00e9sentant d'une entreprise pharmaceutique, le Dr Dick, qui se plaignait d'une r\u00e9union \u00e0 laquelle avaient assist\u00e9 le Dr Chopra et des \u00e9valuateurs du BMV, \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 le Dr Chopra \u00e9tait le chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division du syst\u00e8me nerveux central en f\u00e9vrier 1997. Le Dr Chopra a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la lettre comme une atteinte \u00e0 sa r\u00e9putation. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ensuite que non seulement le minist\u00e8re ne l'a pas appuy\u00e9 pas, mais encore que, en envoyant copie de la lettre \u00e0 plusieurs personnes \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de Sant\u00e9 Canada, il a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 noircir sa r\u00e9putation. La preuve montre que le Dr Chopra a appris que la lettre ne serait pas utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 son d\u00e9triment. En fait, le Dr Chopra n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de cet incident.\n[66] La preuve montre que, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la lettre de plainte, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le Dr Paterson, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Elanco, lui disant que l'affaire ne devrait pas \u00eatre exacerb\u00e9e. La d\u00e9cision de Sant\u00e9 Canada de tenter de d\u00e9samorcer la situation n'a pas eu l'heur de plaire au Dr Chopra, qui voulait que le minist\u00e8re sanctionne le Dr Dick et l'oblige \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des excuses. Devant l'inaction de Sant\u00e9 Canada, le Dr Chopra a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief, demandant l'ouverture d'une enqu\u00eate. Le minist\u00e8re a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, apr\u00e8s l'instruction du grief, de faire un compl\u00e9ment d'enqu\u00eate. Cependant, le minist\u00e8re a mis un terme \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate lorsque le Dr Chopra a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il n'y participerait pas pleinement.\n[67] Le Tribunal a du mal \u00e0 voir en quoi la diffamation peut int\u00e9resser la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cela dit, l'incident Elanco a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'un intense \u00e9change de vues dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. Durant l'audience, le Dr Chopra a \u00e9tabli un lien entre le traitement de la plainte par le minist\u00e8re et la question de la discrimination. L'acte discriminatoire serait l'absence d'une r\u00e9action ad\u00e9quate de Sant\u00e9 Canada devant la plainte du Dr Dick. Selon l'avocat du plaignant, l'attitude adopt\u00e9e par le minist\u00e8re dans la plainte Elanco s'inscrit dans le climat de discrimination dont le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime au fil des ans \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada. Lorsqu'il est port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 la carri\u00e8re du Dr Chopra par des commentaires d\u00e9favorables, de dire l'avocat du plaignant, rien n'est fait, ou presque rien.\n[68] Le Tribunal estime que l'accusation initiale de diffamation port\u00e9e contre l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de la plainte Elanco n'entre pas dans le champ de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Par ailleurs, le Tribunal rel\u00e8ve que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, le Dr Chopra ne s'est jamais plaint d'une quelconque discrimination de la part de quiconque. N\u00e9anmoins, vu l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant, le Tribunal examinera l'incident de la plainte Elanco au regard des questions de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles.\n(iii) La suspension impos\u00e9e au Dr Chopra par le Dr Lachance [69] Le dossier montre que, le 26 mars 1999, le Dr Chopra a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de conf\u00e9rencier \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence annuelle sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi de Patrimoine Canada. Selon le sommaire des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve, le Dr Chopra a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait intervenu personnellement dans la lutte contre le racisme au sein de la fonction publique au cours des dix ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures et que, durant cette p\u00e9riode, il n'avait constat\u00e9 aucune am\u00e9lioration malgr\u00e9 ce que les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s avaient pu entendre de la bouche d'autres pr\u00e9sentateurs au cours de cette conf\u00e9rence annuelle. Le Dr Chopra a dit, dans son t\u00e9moignage, qu'il avait exprim\u00e9 alors une inqui\u00e9tude, tir\u00e9e de ses exp\u00e9riences personnelles \u00e0 la suite de la d\u00e9cision ACNRI, ainsi que sa profonde insatisfaction \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la mani\u00e8re dont le minist\u00e8re appliquait l'ordonnance issue de ladite d\u00e9cision. Selon lui, la situation n'\u00e9voluait pas.\n[70] Le dossier montre aussi que le Dr Chopra avait envoy\u00e9 aux organisateurs de la conf\u00e9rence un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de cinq lignes dans lequel il \u00e9crivait que les r\u00e9sultats obtenus depuis 1987 montraient que la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi et les autres lois de m\u00eame nature avaient eu pour effet de perp\u00e9tuer un racisme sans freins. Le Dr Chopra ajoutait dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 que tout donnait \u00e0 penser qu'il en serait ainsi bien au-del\u00e0 de l'an 2000.\n[71] Le dossier montre que, quelques mois apr\u00e8s la conf\u00e9rence, le Dr Lachance a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au Dr Chopra portant la date du 21 juillet 1999. Dans sa lettre, le Dr Lachance se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 des propos tir\u00e9s, semble-t-il, d'un enregistrement sonore des travaux de la conf\u00e9rence, o\u00f9 le Dr Chopra aurait dit : [traduction] Apr\u00e8s trois ans \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, vous avez eu des nouvelles de notre directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Ressources humaines hier, Bob Joubert. Tout ce que je puis vous dire maintenant, je n'y \u00e9tais pas, chaque mot \u00e9tait un mensonge parce que rien ne change \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, et nous, \u00e0 l'Alliance de la capitale nationale sur les relations inter-raciales [il convient de noter ici que le Dr Chopra fut \u00e0 une certaine \u00e9poque membre de l'Alliance] envisageons de d\u00e9poser une accusation d'outrage au tribunal contre les trois minist\u00e8res, \u00e0 savoir le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, la Commission de la fonction publique et Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[72] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Chopra n'a pas ni\u00e9 qu'il avait pu dire qu'il n'avait constat\u00e9 aucune am\u00e9lioration. Il a cependant ni\u00e9 tout d'abord avoir dit que M. Joubert \u00e9tait un menteur, puis il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait pas nier ou confirmer s'il l'avait dit ou non, parce qu'il n'avait aucun moyen de le savoir. Le Dr Chopra a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 cependant que, si quelqu'un du minist\u00e8re avait dit que tout avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 et qu'il n'y avait plus aucun probl\u00e8me, alors c'\u00e9tait un mensonge.\n[73] La preuve montre que, \u00e0 la suite de cet incident, le Dr Lachance a impos\u00e9 au Dr Chopra une suspension de cinq jours sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et que le Dr Chopra a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique un grief se rapportant audit incident. La preuve montre que le grief du Dr Chopra est all\u00e9 en arbitrage, que son grief a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 par le sous-ministre adjoint, mais plus tard re\u00e7u par la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique. L'arbitre a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'employeur d'annuler la suspension, de verser au Dr Chopra le manque \u00e0 gagner entra\u00een\u00e9 par ladite suspension et d'enlever du dossier du Dr Chopra tous les documents s'y rapportant. Le Dr Chopra a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le minist\u00e8re ne lui a jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'excuses pour l'avoir sanctionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite des propos qu'il avait tenus.\n[74] Dans ses conclusions, l'avocat du plaignant a dit que la question soulev\u00e9e ici concerne la mani\u00e8re dont le minist\u00e8re r\u00e9pond aux pr\u00e9occupations du Dr Chopra. Il s'agit ici d'un cas o\u00f9 le Dr Chopra parle du racisme qui a cours dans la fonction publique, et o\u00f9 le minist\u00e8re, par l'entremise du Dr Lachance, lui impose une sanction au lieu de s'asseoir avec lui pour examiner la question. Pour l'avocat du plaignant, le message envoy\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re est que ce dernier ne tol\u00e9rera aucun d\u00e9bat public ni aucune critique sur les questions de discrimination.\n[75] L'avocat du plaignant a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 au Tribunal que, selon lui, en imposant au Dr Chopra une suspension de cinq jours, le minist\u00e8re, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le Dr Lachance, a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 l'encontre du Dr Chopra pour des propos qu'il avait tenus \u00e0 la faveur d'une tribune. L'avocat du plaignant a ajout\u00e9 que, selon lui, le minist\u00e8re n'a pas aim\u00e9 ce que le Dr Chopra avait dit sur le minist\u00e8re et que, pour cette raison, le minist\u00e8re lui a impos\u00e9 une suspension. Pour l'avocat du plaignant, c'est l\u00e0 une marque de discrimination.\n[76] Vu ces all\u00e9gations, le Tribunal examinera si la suspension impos\u00e9e par le Dr Lachance au Dr Chopra en 1999 \u00e9tait un acte discriminatoire et constituait des repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es en r\u00e9action contre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte.\n(iv) L'exclusion du Dr Chopra de certains projets [77] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu de certains examens scientifiques men\u00e9s en 1991 (Ractopamine) et en 1993 (Flumequine) au sein de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, au Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires. Le Dr Chopra a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'on ne lui a jamais expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi exclu.\n[78] Au cours de son contre-interrogatoire portant sur ces incidents, le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 de dire s'il consid\u00e9rait ou non son exclusion comme une marque de discrimination ou de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de Sant\u00e9 Canada. Le Tribunal croit que la r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e alors par le Dr Chopra \u00e9tait pour le moins impr\u00e9cise, encore que le Dr Chopra ait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au cours de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait pas vu cela comme une discrimination, mais comme des repr\u00e9sailles, ajoutant qu'il avait eu le sentiment d'\u00eatre cibl\u00e9 par Sant\u00e9 Canada pour s'\u00eatre plaint de racisme. L'avocat du plaignant a fait valoir que l'exclusion du Dr Chopra de l'\u00e9tude Flumequine repr\u00e9sente un exemple de certaines des possibilit\u00e9s qui, sans raison apparente, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es au Dr Chopra.\n[79] Le tribunal Soberman et le tribunal Hadjis ne semblent pas avoir examin\u00e9 cet aspect, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'exclusion du Dr Chopra de certains projets men\u00e9s sous l'\u00e9gide du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, son exclusion du projet Ractopamine aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre examin\u00e9e par le tribunal Soberman, qui s'\u00e9tait prononc\u00e9 sur la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le Dr Chopra en septembre 1992. Quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude Flumequine, elle entre dans le champ de la plainte actuelle. Vu la nature de l'all\u00e9gation faite par le Dr Chopra concernant le motif de son exclusion, le Tribunal se prononcera sur cette question dans le contexte d'une accusation de repr\u00e9sailles.\nE. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du Dr Chopra [80] D\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de ses observations, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a soutenu que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait ici la question centrale, affirmant que le Dr Chopra n'\u00e9tait pas un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible, compte tenu de son attitude durant le contre-interrogatoire, de son comportement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, de ses g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations h\u00e2tives, de la preuve contradictoire qu'il a produite, enfin des all\u00e9gations de complot qu'il a faites.\n[81] Au soutien de ces affirmations, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que le Dr Chopra avait refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 certaines questions et s'\u00e9tait montr\u00e9 \u00e9vasif dans ses r\u00e9ponses, qu'il avait donn\u00e9 des explications qui n'avaient aucun sens, qu'une partie de sa preuve \u00e9tait inexacte et que, tr\u00e8s souvent, il n'avait pas r\u00e9agi et s'\u00e9tait montr\u00e9 raisonneur. Pour l'avocat du plaignant, c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 une attaque frontale men\u00e9e contre le Dr Chopra.\n[82] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'attaque frontale de l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 contre la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du Dr Chopra, l'avocat du plaignant a entrepris de placer dans le contexte des questions pos\u00e9es l'attitude, les commentaires, les \u00e9clats et le t\u00e9moignage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Dr Chopra.\n[83] Au cours de ses observations, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a renvoy\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 l'affaire Dhanjal (Dhanjal c. Air Canada, [1996] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 4), \u00e0 l'affaire Martin (Martin c. Gouvernement de la bande Saulteaux, D.T. 07\/02), \u00e0 l'affaire Hill (Hill c. Air Canada, [2003] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 3) et \u00e0 l'affaire Singh (Singh c. Canada (Statistique Canada), [1998] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 7), affirmant que nombre des commentaires faits dans ces pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents \u00e0 propos du plaignant s'appliquaient directement au Dr Chopra. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 s'est plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 aux passages suivants :\nDhanjal\nL'attitude du plaignant en contre-interrogatoire, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 relativement bref et men\u00e9 correctement par l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e, a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice de sa personnalit\u00e9. Il s'est montr\u00e9 agressif, tentant souvent d'\u00e9viter de r\u00e9pondre aux questions, argumentant souvent avec le procureur et allant m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 refuser de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 certaines questions. Le Tribunal a d\u00fb le rappeler \u00e0 l'ordre en lui ordonnant de r\u00e9pondre aux questions pos\u00e9es et de cesser d'argumenter avec le procureur plus d'une fois. Le plaignant a m\u00eame manqu\u00e9 de respect envers le procureur au moins une fois en traitant sa question d'idiote au lieu d'y r\u00e9pondre. Bref, par son attitude, le plaignant a accr\u00e9dit\u00e9 pleinement la th\u00e8se de l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 savoir que M. Dhanjal est un individu irascible, peu coop\u00e9ratif et manipulateur et que ce sont ces traits de personnalit\u00e9 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause v\u00e9ritable de ses probl\u00e8mes de relations de travail avec Guy Goodman. (D\u00e9cision Dhanjal, paragraphe 181.)\nMartin\nJ'ai \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 peu convaincue par la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Julia Night. L'attitude de celle-ci \u00e9tait fort diff\u00e9rente lors de son t\u00e9moignage en interroga[toire] principal et de son contre-interrogatoire. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage en interrogatoire principal, Mme Night semblait agr\u00e9able et amicale, tandis que durant le contre-interrogatoire, elle \u00e9tait souvent sur la d\u00e9fensive et parfois tr\u00e8s agressive. Mme Night a fait preuve d'un degr\u00e9 surprenant d'hostilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit de l'avocat de la Commission, compte tenu que son r\u00f4le dans les \u00e9v\u00e9nements ayant men\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte \u00e9tait marginal, et que sa conduite n'\u00e9tait pas en cause en l'esp\u00e8ce. (D\u00e9cision Martin, paragraphe 102.)\nHill\nM. Hill a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin partial; sa perception des faits \u00e9tait souvent influenc\u00e9e par ses sentiments. Il a eu tendance \u00e0 tout ramener \u00e0 un d\u00e9nominateur commun : le traitement injuste dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet. [...] J'ai n\u00e9anmoins constat\u00e9 que le comportement de M. Hill dans la salle d'audience \u00e9tait fonci\u00e8rement agressif. Je comprends son sentiment d'injustice, mais il s'est nettement tromp\u00e9 ou m\u00e9pris sur un certain nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments et n'a pas voulu faire la part des choses. (D\u00e9cision Hill, paragraphes 11 et 12.)\nSingh\nLe tribunal n'entretient aucun doute en ce qui concerne la bonne foi de M. Singh qui est convaincu d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime de discrimination en fonction de l'\u00e2ge et de son origine nationale ou ethnique durant la presque totalit\u00e9 de son emploi \u00e0 Statistique Canada : en fait, pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de son t\u00e9moignage, le sentiment de l'outrage ressenti \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du traitement que lui aurait inflig\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait perceptible. Pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de son t\u00e9moignage, toutefois, M. Singh a souvent fait des affirmations p\u00e9remptoires lorsqu'il a sembl\u00e9 qu'il pensait que cela pourrait faire avancer sa cause. M\u00eame s'il retirait habituellement ces affirmations lorsqu'on l'encourageait \u00e0 le faire, cette tendance suscite n\u00e9anmoins des inqui\u00e9tudes concernant la fiabilit\u00e9 de M. Singh comme t\u00e9moin. (D\u00e9cision Singh, paragraphe 169.)\n[84] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Chopra, le Tribunal ne doute nullement que le Dr Chopra ressent de la col\u00e8re et de l'amertume contre Sant\u00e9 Canada et qu'il a le sentiment d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un traitement injuste, de discrimination, de repr\u00e9sailles et de harc\u00e8lement. Il a l'impression qu'une conspiration a \u00e9t\u00e9 foment\u00e9e contre lui \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada et que Sant\u00e9 Canada a orchestr\u00e9 certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements dans le dessein de le faire mal para\u00eetre.\n[85] Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que, durant son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Chopra a fait des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations h\u00e2tives qui portent atteinte \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, \u00e0 son objectivit\u00e9 ou qui donnent \u00e0 penser qu'il n'a pas le sens des proportions. Ainsi, le Dr Chopra disait, \u00e0 propos des commentaires du Dr Gunner (Qu'en est-il de Shiv Chopra?), qu'il croyait - il le croyait alors et il le croit maintenant - que les Canadiens sont aujourd'hui un peuple raciste. Mais il y a du racisme \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada et au sein du gouvernement du Canada. Comme je l'ai dit plus haut, le tribunal Hadjis a estim\u00e9 que les commentaires du Dr Gunner n'\u00e9taient nullement discriminatoires, m\u00eame si le Dr Chopra en a pris ombrage.\n[86] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Chopra a exprim\u00e9 l'avis que toute nomination faite \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada depuis 1977 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoire. Il est all\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 affirmer, s'agissant de savoir s'il y avait ou non des conflits interpersonnels entre lui et ses coll\u00e8gues, que les conflits en question \u00e9taient en fait des plaintes fabriqu\u00e9es de toutes pi\u00e8ces contre lui par la direction ou au nom de la direction.\n[87] Naturellement, le Dr Chopra a droit \u00e0 ses propres opinions, par exemple sur la question de savoir si le minist\u00e8re, ou sa division, \u00e9tait ou non fonctionnel, sur la question de savoir si les plaintes \u00e9taient ou non port\u00e9es contre lui personnellement ou contre le minist\u00e8re, ou sur la question de savoir s'il s'entendait ou non avec les gens ou avec ses coll\u00e8gues. Tout cela est affaire d'opinion. Comme l'a dit l'avocat du plaignant, il s'agit l\u00e0 des mani\u00e8res de voir du Dr Chopra, et il peut avoir raison comme il peut avoir tort. Cela dit, le Tribunal ne saurait ignorer le fait que les vues exprim\u00e9es sans r\u00e9serve par le Dr Chopra sont enracin\u00e9es dans de solides convictions qui n\u00e9cessairement influencent l'opinion qu'il a de Sant\u00e9 Canada, de la direction de Sant\u00e9 Canada, de ses coll\u00e8gues ainsi que de la discrimination.\n[88] Le Tribunal a aussi observ\u00e9 que, durant le contre-interrogatoire du Dr Chopra, ses r\u00e9ponses allaient le plus souvent bien au-del\u00e0 de ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question et que le Dr Chopra avait tendance \u00e0 donner sa propre interpr\u00e9tation des choses. Naturellement, le Dr Chopra a le droit de donner une r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te aux questions qui lui sont pos\u00e9es. N\u00e9anmoins, ses r\u00e9ponses prenaient parfois la forme d'un long discours sur la discrimination au sein du minist\u00e8re, sur l'absence de changements, etc. Maintes et maintes fois, le Tribunal a d\u00fb lui rappeler qu'il devait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question qui lui \u00e9tait pos\u00e9e et que, s'il voulait donner des renseignements additionnels, il devait le faire apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la question.\n[89] Le Tribunal a remarqu\u00e9 aussi que, parfois, le Dr Chopra n'h\u00e9sitait pas \u00e0 faire des d\u00e9clarations qui n'avaient aucun fondement dans la preuve, par exemple \u00e0 propos du travail du Dr Alexander (son travail consistait \u00e0 harceler les gens), de la plainte Zohair (le minist\u00e8re a incit\u00e9 Mme Zohair \u00e0 entrer en conflit avec lui), de la plainte Elanco (c'est Sant\u00e9 Canada qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte) et de l'incident Casorso (qu'en est-il de Shiv Chopra?), que le Dr Chopra rattachait aux commentaires du Dr Liston. Les d\u00e9clarations de ce genre minent la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'un t\u00e9moin et, dans le cas du Dr Chopra, le Tribunal se doit d'\u00eatre tr\u00e8s prudent quant aux opinions qu'il a exprim\u00e9es, plus particuli\u00e8rement quant \u00e0 sa mani\u00e8re d'interpr\u00e9ter les raisons pouvant expliquer les actions et d\u00e9cisions de Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[90] Apr\u00e8s examen des extraits pertinents du t\u00e9moignage du Dr Chopra, le Tribunal croit que le Dr Chopra avait tendance \u00e0 faire des conjectures ou des suppositions sur certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements, au lieu de dire qu'il ne savait pas, et \u00e0 se targuer de conna\u00eetre certains sujets ou \u00e0 amplifier sa connaissance de certains sujets, par exemple les titres de comp\u00e9tence, les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents et l'exp\u00e9rience de coll\u00e8gues ou de gestionnaires. Souvent, dans ses r\u00e9ponses, le Dr Chopra ajoutait des petites observations qui \u00e9taient sans rapport avec la question pos\u00e9e.\n[91] Le Tribunal voit le Dr Chopra comme une personne dogmatique, p\u00e9remptoire, tr\u00e8s s\u00fbre d'elle, fi\u00e8re, soucieuse de se faire entendre, une personne qui d\u00e9fend ses droits, qui a tr\u00e8s \u00e0 cur les questions d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, qui n'acceptera aucune forme de discrimination, flagrante ou subtile, qui d\u00e9posera un grief d\u00e8s qu'il aura l'impression de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 \u00e9quitablement ou que l'on a pris des d\u00e9cisions qu'il juge d\u00e9raisonnables. Il c\u00e9dera rarement, m\u00eame devant une preuve incontestable contredisant ses affirmations. La preuve montre aussi que, d'apr\u00e8s son exp\u00e9rience pass\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de Sant\u00e9 Canada, et d'apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures de tribunaux des droits de la personne, le Dr Chopra est d'avis que les repr\u00e9sentants de Sant\u00e9 Canada sont des racistes, et que toute la population du Canada l'est aussi.\n[92] Mais le Dr Chopra est \u00e9galement quelqu'un qui a travaill\u00e9 dans un minist\u00e8re qui, selon les conclusions d'un tribunal des droits de la personne, a agi d'une mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des minorit\u00e9s visibles (la d\u00e9cision ACNRI) et auquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 d'appliquer des mesures correctives, temporaires et permanentes, visant \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les questions de discrimination. Par ailleurs, le dossier montre que le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame victime de discrimination de la part de Sant\u00e9 Canada (le tribunal Hadjis), que des \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s dans son dos alors qu'il travaillait \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada et que des commentaires d\u00e9favorables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9s \u00e0 son sujet sans qu'il en soit inform\u00e9 (la plainte Drennan, la note Cuddihy et le Dr Liston).\n[93] Le Tribunal est d'avis que, vu la mani\u00e8re dont le Dr Chopra s'est conduit durant son contre-interrogatoire, sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 est un aspect important, sinon crucial, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ainsi que l'a affirm\u00e9 l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9. Cela dit, le Tribunal est n\u00e9anmoins d'avis que, vu le contexte particulier dans lequel cette plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision ACNRI et la d\u00e9cision Hadjis, le Tribunal doit examiner plus avant les all\u00e9gations faites par le Dr Chopra au regard des articles 7, 10, 14 et 14.1 de la Loi et consid\u00e9rer l'ensemble de la preuve, qu'elle soit testimoniale, documentaire ou circonstancielle, pour voir si les dispositions en cause ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transgress\u00e9es.\nIII. LES QUESTIONS DE FOND [94] La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le Dr Chopra contre Sant\u00e9 Canada contient plusieurs all\u00e9gations qui se rapportent \u00e0 la discrimination, aux repr\u00e9sailles et au harc\u00e8lement. Avant d'analyser chacune de ces all\u00e9gations, il importe d'\u00e9noncer les dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne qui int\u00e9ressent l'analyse desdites all\u00e9gations, ainsi que les principes juridiques applicables.\nA. Les dispositions applicables de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne [95] La plainte du Dr Chopra se r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le Dr Chopra all\u00e8gue que son employeur s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement et \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles, aux articles 14 et 14.1 de la Loi.\n(i) Article 7 [96] Dans sa plainte, le Dr Chopra \u00e9crit qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur son origine ethnique, puisqu'il est originaire de l'Inde. L'article 7 de la Loi dispose que Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects : a) de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu; b) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi. Les motifs de distinction illicite, qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi, sont la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n(ii) Article 10 [97] Dans sa plainte, le Dr Chopra all\u00e8gue que Sant\u00e9 Canada s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique et la violation par Sant\u00e9 Canada de l'article 10 de la Loi, ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 : Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait, pour l'employeur, l'association patronale ou l'organisation syndicale : a) de fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite; b) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l'engagement, les promotions, la formation, l'apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d'un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n(iii) Article 14 [98] Le Dr Chopra affirme que certaines des mesures prises par Sant\u00e9 Canada \u00e0 son encontre constituent du harc\u00e8lement. L'alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi : Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\n(iv) Article 14.1 [99] Le Dr Chopra soutient que nombre des mesures prises par Sant\u00e9 Canada constituaient des repr\u00e9sailles. Au sujet des repr\u00e9sailles, l'article 14.1 de la Loi est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi : Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d'exercer ou de menacer d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n(v) Article 65 [100] L'article 65 de la Loi m\u00e9rite \u00e9galement d'\u00eatre mentionn\u00e9 au regard des dispositions susmentionn\u00e9es de la Loi. Le paragraphe 65(1) dispose ainsi : Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les actes ou omissions commis par un employ\u00e9, un mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant dans le cadre de son emploi sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s, pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par la personne, l'organisme ou l'association qui l'emploie. Quant au paragraphe 65(2) de la Loi, il est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 : La personne, l'organisme ou l'association vis\u00e9 au paragraphe (1) peut se soustraire \u00e0 son application s'il \u00e9tablit que l'acte ou l'omission a eu lieu sans son consentement, qu'il avait pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l'emp\u00eacher et que, par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 d'en att\u00e9nuer ou d'en annuler les effets.\nB. Les principes juridiques applicables [101] Il importe d'entr\u00e9e de jeu d'exposer les principes juridiques applicables \u00e0 l'examen des points soulev\u00e9s par le plaignant contre l'intim\u00e9 qui concernent la discrimination, les repr\u00e9sailles et le harc\u00e8lement.\n(i) Discrimination [102] Dans les affaires portant sur les droits de la personne, de m\u00eame que dans les affaires civiles, il incombe au plaignant, ou au demandeur, d'\u00e9tablir ce qu'il avance, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve. Celui qui r\u00e9clame l'ex\u00e9cution d'une obligation doit la prouver. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons Sears Ltd. (O'Malley), [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536.\n[103] Cela dit, dans les proc\u00e9dures port\u00e9es devant les tribunaux des droits de la personne, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination avant que la charge de la preuve soit transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, lequel doit alors donner une explication raisonnable, autre qu'un simple pr\u00e9texte, propre \u00e0 convaincre le Tribunal que, par exemple, la raison pour laquelle une personne n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste n'avait absolument rien \u00e0 voir avec un motif de distinction illicite. Comme l'\u00e9crivait le juge McIntyre dans l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, la preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve du contraire est une preuve qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffit \u00e0 justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9. Autrement dit, la preuve prima facie est une preuve qui, si elle est jug\u00e9e cr\u00e9dible, et si l'intim\u00e9 n'y r\u00e9pond pas d'une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante, suffira au plaignant pour avoir gain de cause.\n[104] Dans la d\u00e9cision Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [2005] A.C.F. n\u00b0 731, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re O'Malley \u00e9tait le crit\u00e8re juridique de la preuve prima facie de discrimination dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Selon ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, est une question mixte de droit et de fait la question de savoir si la preuve produite dans un cas donn\u00e9 suffit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une diff\u00e9rence pr\u00e9judiciable de traitement fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite, lorsque cette preuve est jug\u00e9e cr\u00e9dible et que l'intim\u00e9 n'y a pas r\u00e9pondu d'une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante (d\u00e9cision Morris, paragraphe 27).\n[105] Le Tribunal partage l'opinion exprim\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Singh c. Canada (Statistique Canada), [1998] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 7, au paragraphe 197, opinion selon laquelle, pour que soit \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le plaignant doit offrir davantage que des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations h\u00e2tives. Par ailleurs, comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Bobb, une simple all\u00e9gation selon laquelle telle ou telle conduite \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par des consid\u00e9rations raciales ne saurait remplacer une preuve des faits (Bobb v. Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission), [2004] A.J. No. 117, paragraphe 76). Le Tribunal partage \u00e9galement l'opinion selon laquelle un tribunal devrait s'abstenir de conclure \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite lorsque la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par le plaignant peut raisonnablement avoir une autre explication.\n[106] La conviction, si ferme soit-elle, qu'une personne est victime de discrimination ne permet pas en droit de conclure \u00e0 l'existence de discrimination ni n'\u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination (Singh c. (Statistique Canada) [1998] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 7, paragraphe 206). Comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., [2005] TCDP 32, au paragraphe 40, il doit exister une preuve, c'est-\u00e0-dire des faits mat\u00e9riels qui, s'ils sont jug\u00e9s cr\u00e9dibles, rendront la discrimination plus probable que l'absence de discrimination, compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances.\n[107] Finalement, pour qu'il y ait preuve prima facie de discrimination, il ne suffit pas au plaignant d'affirmer qu'il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 ou plus qualifi\u00e9, qu'il faisait partie d'un groupe qui a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible de la discrimination et qu'il n'a pas obtenu le poste (Potocnik c. Thunder Bay (City), 1996 O.H.R.B.I.D. No 29, paragraphe 13).\n[108] Au fil des ans, les tribunaux des droits de la personne ont reconnu que les plaignants disposent rarement d'une preuve directe attestant que la discrimination \u00e9tait le facteur \u00e0 l'origine d'une d\u00e9cision ou d'un comportement, et cela parce que la discrimination n'est pas une attitude que l'on manifeste en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ouvertement. Comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1988] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 2, il est rare que l'on puisse \u00e9tablir la discrimination au moyen d'une preuve directe.\n[109] Un plaignant qui all\u00e8gue la discrimination doit donc le plus souvent s'en remettre \u00e0 une preuve circonstancielle, et notamment \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont telle personne ou telle organisation s'est comport\u00e9e envers lui (Brooks c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans), 2006 A.C.F. n\u00b0 1569, paragraphe 27). Le crit\u00e8re est le suivant : la preuve circonstancielle, si elle est jug\u00e9e cr\u00e9dible, va-t-elle dans le sens de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e?\n[110] Dans la d\u00e9cision Brooks, le Tribunal \u00e9crivait, au sujet de la preuve circonstancielle, qu'il ne suffit pas que la preuve circonstancielle soit compatible avec une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination. Cela ne fait qu'\u00e9tablir la possibilit\u00e9 de discrimination, ce qui ne suffit pas \u00e0 prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de la cause. La preuve doit \u00eatre incompatible avec d'autres possibilit\u00e9s. (D\u00e9cision Brooks, paragraphe 114.)\n[111] Cela dit, comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Wall c. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, [1997] D.C.D.P. no 6, la norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination reste la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s et, s'agissant de la preuve circonstancielle, le crit\u00e8re est le suivant : on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se (B. Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Carwell, 1987, page 142).\n[112] Partant, pour savoir si une conduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est ou non discriminatoire, le Tribunal doit analyser et examiner attentivement la conduite en soi ainsi que le contexte dans lequel elle s'est manifest\u00e9e, en gardant \u00e0 l'esprit, comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Marinaki c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines), [2000] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 2, que, pour qu'un plaignant obtienne gain de cause, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit l'unique raison de l'acte reproch\u00e9, il suffit qu'elle l'explique en partie (d\u00e9cision Marinaki, paragraphe 191). L'intention d'exercer de la discrimination ne permet pas de conclure \u00e0 l'existence de discrimination (Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission) v. Play it Again Sports Ltd, [2004] N.S.J. No 403, paragraphe 37).\n[113] Quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des chances qu'a une personne d'obtenir un poste int\u00e9rimaire ou un poste permanent, l'avocat du plaignant a renvoy\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 un arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan, [1992] 2 C.F. 401, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'opinion du juge Marceau, en faisant valoir que, pour \u00e9tablir qu'une personne aurait obtenu un certain poste, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver que, sans l'acte discriminatoire, elle aurait certainement obtenu le poste. Selon l'avocat du plaignant, il suffit de prouver que, sans l'acte discriminatoire, il est fort possible qu'elle l'aurait obtenu (d\u00e9cision Morgan, page 412).\n(ii) Repr\u00e9sailles [114] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, dans sa forme actuelle, ne consid\u00e8re les repr\u00e9sailles ou les menaces de repr\u00e9sailles que dans le cadre d'une plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et d'une conduite qui fait suite \u00e0 la plainte ainsi d\u00e9pos\u00e9e (Witwicky c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [2007] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 28). La source des repr\u00e9sailles doit donc \u00eatre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte et non, par exemple, un \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui est survenu avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. La loi est claire. L'article 14.1 ne consid\u00e8re les repr\u00e9sailles qu'en rapport avec le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte. Par ailleurs, comme l'\u00e9crivait le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Marinaki c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines), [2000] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 2, paragraphe 224, l'article 14.1 de la Loi est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 30 juin 1998, sans effet r\u00e9troactif. Appliquer la nouvelle disposition de la Loi concernant les repr\u00e9sailles aux actes survenus avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la disposition, ce serait attacher des cons\u00e9quences nouvelles \u00e0 des incidents qui ont eu lieu avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la disposition. On donnerait ainsi, selon le Tribunal, un effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 la Loi, ce qui n'est pas en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral admissible et ce que le libell\u00e9 du texte l\u00e9gislatif n'autorise pas.\n[115] Le dossier montre que la plainte initiale du Dr Chopra porte la date du 13 mai 1998. Ainsi, pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles aux termes de l'article 14.1 de la Loi, le fait invoqu\u00e9 dans une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles doit avoir eu lieu apr\u00e8s le 30 juin 1998. Il s'ensuit que le Tribunal ne saurait consid\u00e9rer comme repr\u00e9sailles les actes ou faits ant\u00e9rieurs au 30 juin 1998, \u00e0 savoir la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e exclusion du Dr Chopra du projet Flumequine en 1993, la nomination Scott en 1994, l'incident Elanco en 1997, et la nomination du Dr Lachance en f\u00e9vrier 1998. Les seuls faits auxquels l'article 14.1 de la Loi puisse s'appliquer sont la plainte Zohair de 1999, la nomination du Dr Butler et du Dr Alexander en 1999 \u00e0 des postes int\u00e9rimaires et la suspension impos\u00e9e au Dr Chopra par le Dr Lachance en ao\u00fbt 1999.\n(iii) Harc\u00e8lement [116] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne d\u00e9finit pas le harc\u00e8lement, mais la jurisprudence donne une telle d\u00e9finition. Dans la d\u00e9cision Hill c. Air Canada, 2003 TCDP 9, le Tribunal \u00e9crivait que le harc\u00e8lement r\u00e9side essentiellement dans la cr\u00e9ation d'un climat de travail hostile qui porte atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 personnelle du plaignant. Dans la d\u00e9cision Marinaki c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines), [2002] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 2, le Tribunal examinait les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui doivent \u00eatre pris en compte lorsqu'il s'agit de savoir s'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement au sens de l'article 14 de la Loi.\n[117] Dans l'affaire Marinaki, le Tribunal exprimait l'avis que les victimes de harc\u00e8lement n'ont pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'elles ont subi des pertes financi\u00e8res, et que, pour qu'un comportement soit assimilable \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement, il faut une certaine r\u00e9p\u00e9tition ou persistance, encore que, dans certains cas, un seul incident grave suffise \u00e0 constituer du harc\u00e8lement (d\u00e9cision Marinaki, paragraphes 188-191). Comme on peut le lire dans le jugement Bobb v. Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission), [2004] A.J. No 117, un seul incident peut, dans certains cas, suffire \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile. Dans ces cas, la nature de la conduite doit \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e selon la r\u00e8gle des donn\u00e9es inversement proportionnelles : plus graves sont la conduite et ses cons\u00e9quences, moins la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de cette conduite sera n\u00e9cessaire; \u00e0 l'inverse, moins grave sera la conduite, plus elle devra avoir persist\u00e9.\nC. Les all\u00e9gations en cause [118] Vu la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal concernant la plainte Drennan, les commentaires Liston et l'incident Gunner, ces sujets ne font pas partie des questions sur lesquelles le Tribunal doit se prononcer au regard de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[119] Les questions \u00e0 examiner dans le cadre de la plainte actuelle sont de trois ordres : premi\u00e8rement, le Tribunal examinera les aspects li\u00e9s \u00e0 divers postes \u00e0 pourvoir, \u00e0 savoir la nomination du Dr Scott au regard des mesures correctives qui furent ordonn\u00e9es (1995), la nomination du Dr Lachance au poste de directeur, BMV (1997), l'autonomination du Dr Paterson au poste de directeur, BMV (1998), et les nominations du Dr Alexander et du Dr Butler comme chefs par int\u00e9rim (1999). Deuxi\u00e8mement, le Tribunal examinera les incidents que le plaignant a d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme porteurs de discrimination ou de repr\u00e9sailles, \u00e0 savoir les propos tenus par le Dr Lachance lors d'une r\u00e9union du BMV (1998), la suspension impos\u00e9e au Dr Chopra par le Dr Lachance (1999), la plainte Zohair (1999) et la plainte Elanco (1997). Troisi\u00e8mement, le Tribunal examinera l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique faite par le plaignant.\n[120] Comme je l'ai dit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le plaignant affirme, dans ses formulaires de plainte, ainsi que dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions annex\u00e9 \u00e0 l'un des formulaires de plainte et dans ses all\u00e9gations additionnelles, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de Sant\u00e9 Canada et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9 et discr\u00e9dit\u00e9 par Sant\u00e9 Canada. Le Tribunal \u00e9valuera lesdites all\u00e9gations au regard des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants : discrimination, repr\u00e9sailles et harc\u00e8lement.\n[121] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, l'avocat du plaignant \u00e9crit que, bien que la plainte du Dr Chopra soit fond\u00e9e sur une preuve de discrimination se rapportant \u00e0 plusieurs incidents particuliers, tous ces incidents doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur contexte et comme partie d'un sch\u00e9ma qui est le r\u00e9sultat de discrimination raciale syst\u00e9mique. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est imp\u00e9ratif que les incidents d\u00e9crits dans la plainte soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s globalement et les uns par rapport aux autres, pour que les rapprochements requis puissent \u00eatre faits et pour que des conclusions soient tir\u00e9es concernant l'incidence de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique en milieu de travail.\n[122] Dans ses observations finales, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que, pour nombre des all\u00e9gations de discrimination faites par le Dr Chopra, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne permet de conclure \u00e0 la discrimination, si ce n'est de simples all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de racisme, rien de plus, en tout cas rien qui puisse autoriser le Tribunal \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 la discrimination. Pour l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9, les all\u00e9gations du Dr Chopra ne sont pas cr\u00e9dibles et aucune n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par qui que ce soit. Selon lui, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 est le facteur d\u00e9cisif en l'esp\u00e8ce. Par ailleurs, il soutient que les all\u00e9gations qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es promptement devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es avec suspicion.\n[123] Dans ses observations orales, l'avocat du plaignant a invit\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 examiner l'historique de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, affirmant que l'historique en question comprend notamment les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures rendues dans l'affaire Alliance de la capitale nationale sur les relations inter-raciales (la d\u00e9cision ACNRI), et l'affaire Chopra (la d\u00e9cision Hadjis), et que lesdites d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9sentent le contexte dans lequel s'inscrit la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Pour l'avocat du plaignant, le Tribunal ne saurait ignorer les conclusions tir\u00e9es par les formations ant\u00e9rieures, ni le contexte dans lequel elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9es, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elles l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de certains des faits se rapportant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte et qu'elles auraient influ\u00e9 sur les perspectives de carri\u00e8re du Dr Chopra.\n[124] Sur ce point, l'avocat du plaignant a fait valoir qu'il sera extr\u00eamement utile pour le Tribunal de savoir qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que le minist\u00e8re s'\u00e9tait livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires \u00e0 une \u00e9poque imm\u00e9diatement ant\u00e9rieure aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui int\u00e9ressent le Tribunal, ou \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque que lesdits \u00e9v\u00e9nements. L'avocat du plaignant a aussi fait valoir que, s'il y a eu discrimination en 1991, alors, vu le pass\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re, il y aura eu discrimination \u00e9galement apr\u00e8s cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0.\n[125] Le dossier montre que, dans la d\u00e9cision Hadjis, le Tribunal avait estim\u00e9 que le candidat qui avait obtenu en 1991 le poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments humains prescrits n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9, que le Dr Chopra avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination au regard de cette nomination et que, si le Dr Chopra avait exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque les fonctions de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments humains prescrits, il aurait pu justifier d'une exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion, condition pr\u00e9alable pour franchir l'\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, paragraphe 266).\n[126] Dans la d\u00e9cision Alliance de la capitale nationale sur les relations inter-raciales (la d\u00e9cision ACNRI), le Tribunal avait fait plusieurs constatations, \u00e0 savoir les suivantes :\nil y a une importante sous-repr\u00e9sentation des minorit\u00e9s visibles dans la haute direction \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada; le fait que les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles n'acc\u00e8dent pas aux postes de direction ne peut pas s'expliquer par un manque d'int\u00e9r\u00eat ni un manque de comp\u00e9tences techniques ou professionnelles de leur part; le fait que les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada n'ont pas l'exp\u00e9rience requise en gestion pour pouvoir \u00eatre promus \u00e0 des postes de haute direction a \u00e9t\u00e9 un th\u00e8me courant dans les t\u00e9moignages; l'exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaire en gestion peut \u00eatre obtenue par la nomination \u00e0 des postes int\u00e9rimaires, par l'exercice de responsabilit\u00e9s de supervision et par des programmes de formation en gestion; les nominations int\u00e9rimaires ont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une tr\u00e8s forte proportion de l'ensemble des mesures de dotation \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada entre 1991 et 1995; les nominations int\u00e9rimaires ont souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es sans concours et selon un processus officieux. En cons\u00e9quence, on ne prend pas en consid\u00e9ration des personnes potentiellement qualifi\u00e9es pour le poste ou, lorsqu'une nomination int\u00e9rimaire est contest\u00e9e, le processus de s\u00e9lection ult\u00e9rieur est influenc\u00e9 par un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 involontaire de telle sorte que la personne nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 l'origine est habituellement maintenue en fonction; les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles obtenaient proportionnellement moins de postes int\u00e9rimaires que les autres employ\u00e9s; les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e9taient d\u00e9savantag\u00e9s dans la fa\u00e7on dont ils prenaient connaissance des postes int\u00e9rimaires \u00e0 pourvoir. Les employ\u00e9s n'appartenant pas aux minorit\u00e9s visibles se voyaient plus souvent demand\u00e9s par leurs gestionnaires de poser leur candidature, tandis que les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles devaient \u00eatre plus dynamiques afin de d\u00e9couvrir les possibilit\u00e9s de nominations int\u00e9rimaires; les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles recevaient une formation moindre en gestion que les employ\u00e9s n'appartenant pas aux minorit\u00e9s visibles; les employ\u00e9s n'appartenant pas aux minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e9taient plus souvent inform\u00e9s des possibilit\u00e9s de formation en gestion par leurs gestionnaires, tandis que les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles devaient compter beaucoup plus sur eux-m\u00eames pour prendre connaissance de ces possibilit\u00e9s; les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e9taient d\u00e9savantag\u00e9s dans le domaine de la supervision d'autres employ\u00e9s. La formation en gestion et le fait d'avoir auparavant occup\u00e9 un poste par int\u00e9rim accroissaient la probabilit\u00e9 d'exercer des responsabilit\u00e9s de supervision tant pour les employ\u00e9s n'appartenant pas aux minorit\u00e9s visibles que pour les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles. Cependant, dans le cas des employ\u00e9s n'appartenant pas aux minorit\u00e9s visibles et ayant re\u00e7u une formation en gestion, ou ayant occup\u00e9 des postes par int\u00e9rim, il y avait augmentation notable de la probabilit\u00e9 d'exercer des fonctions de supervision comparativement aux membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles; la haute direction consid\u00e8re les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles comme culturellement diff\u00e9rents au sein de Sant\u00e9 Canada et comme inaptes \u00e0 occuper des postes de direction.\n[127] Dans l'affaire ACNRI, le Tribunal a conclu que Sant\u00e9 Canada s'\u00e9tait livr\u00e9 \u00e0 certaines pratiques de dotation en personnel qui \u00e9taient contraires \u00e0 l'article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et il a ordonn\u00e9 au minist\u00e8re d'adopter et d'appliquer un programme sp\u00e9cial de mesures correctives, certaines d'entre elles de nature permanente et d'autres de nature temporaire.\n(i) Questions se rapportant aux divers postes \u00e0 pourvoir [128] Dans ses formulaires de plainte dat\u00e9s du 13 mai 1998 et du 12 janvier 1999, ainsi que dans ses all\u00e9gations additionnelles dat\u00e9es du 27 juin 1999, le plaignant \u00e9crit que, tout au long de sa carri\u00e8re \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, on lui a refus\u00e9 des perspectives d'avancement. Il donne une s\u00e9rie d'exemples pour montrer qu'on lui a refus\u00e9 de telles perspectives, qu'aucun de ses coll\u00e8gues de race blanche n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et que, s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des autres, c'est en raison de sa race, de sa couleur et de son origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[129] Le plaignant affirme aussi que Sant\u00e9 Canada a toujours \u00e9vit\u00e9 d'offrir des postes de direction \u00e0 des candidats qualifi\u00e9s qui sont membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles et que la pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du minist\u00e8re consiste \u00e0 recruter ses EX \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur m\u00eame de Sant\u00e9 Canada, sauf si des candidats qualifi\u00e9s et membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9s par ces postes, auquel cas le minist\u00e8re proc\u00e8de \u00e0 un recrutement externe.\n[130] Le Tribunal analysera donc les divers postes \u00e0 pourvoir qui ont pu \u00e9chapper au plaignant durant la p\u00e9riode allant de 1993 \u00e0 1999, dans la mesure o\u00f9 d'autres tribunaux ne se sont pas prononc\u00e9s sur les nominations en question.\na) La nomination du Dr Scott (1995) [131] Dans les pr\u00e9cisions jointes \u00e0 sa plainte modifi\u00e9e, le Dr Chopra \u00e9crit qu'il y a au moins deux exemples r\u00e9cents o\u00f9 des perspectives d'avancement lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es. Puis il \u00e9crit que le premier de ces exemples remonte \u00e0 1997 (1993 apr\u00e8s correction), lorsqu'il a rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Gunner, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Direction des aliments, lequel lui avait demand\u00e9 ce qu'il convenait de faire pour qu'il soit trait\u00e9 avec \u00e9quit\u00e9. Le Dr Chopra lui avait r\u00e9pondu qu'il souhaitait se voir offrir le poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires (BMV), qui \u00e9tait vacant. Le Dr Chopra avait alors pos\u00e9 sa candidature, mais elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9e. Quand il a fait appel de cette d\u00e9cision de dotation, on a rejet\u00e9 son appel en lui disant que, s'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu, c'\u00e9tait parce qu'il ne pouvait pas justifier d'une exp\u00e9rience de la gestion et des m\u00e9dias, ni d'une exp\u00e9rience internationale.\n[132] Le plaignant affirme, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, que rien de tout cela n'\u00e9tait vrai, qu'il pouvait justifier d'une exp\u00e9rience en gestion, acquise avant son int\u00e9gration \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada et depuis qu'il avait int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le minist\u00e8re, le plus r\u00e9cemment en 1996, durant quatre mois, en tant que chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division des m\u00e9dicaments endocriniens, antiparasitaires et du syst\u00e8me nerveux central. S'agissant de l'exp\u00e9rience des m\u00e9dias, le plaignant affirme qu'il a une grande exp\u00e9rience des m\u00e9dias, acquise \u00e0 la faveur de son travail communautaire en mati\u00e8re de racisme et \u00e0 la faveur de ses plaintes. S'agissant de l'exp\u00e9rience internationale, le plaignant dit qu'il est un boursier de l'Organisation mondiale de la sant\u00e9.\n[133] Le plaignant explique ensuite que le candidat retenu pour le poste de directeur du BMV fut le Dr Tim Scott, que le Dr Scott est de race blanche et qu'il vient d'Agriculture Canada. Le plaignant \u00e9crit que, peu apr\u00e8s que le Dr Scott fut nomm\u00e9 au poste, il est devenu \u00e9vident qu'il n'avait pas les comp\u00e9tences ni les connaissances requises pour le poste. Le plaignant affirme ensuite que le Dr Scott a obtenu \u00e0 un certain moment une affectation sp\u00e9ciale aupr\u00e8s du directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Direction des aliments, le Dr George Paterson, et que celui-ci s'\u00e9tait lui-m\u00eame d\u00e9sign\u00e9 directeur int\u00e9rimaire, tout en restant \u00e9galement directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et en conservant le Dr Scott en affectation sp\u00e9ciale aupr\u00e8s de lui. Le plaignant se dit alors convaincu que cela fut fait pour l'emp\u00eacher de pr\u00e9senter sa candidature au poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires.\n[134] Finalement, dans sa plainte, le plaignant \u00e9voque le fait que le poste de chef de la Division des m\u00e9dicaments endocriniens, antiparasitaires et du syst\u00e8me nerveux central a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 1997 \u00e0 la faveur d'une fusion, et il se dit convaincu que le poste de chef fut aboli pour l'emp\u00eacher, lui ainsi que les autres membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles au sein du BMV, de poser leur candidature \u00e0 ce poste \u00e0 la faveur d'un concours public.\n[135] Comme je l'ai dit plus haut, le Tribunal n'examinera que les faits post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d'ordonner des mesures correctives apr\u00e8s que le Dr Casorso eut obtenu gain de cause dans son appel, il ne revisitera pas les questions examin\u00e9es et tranch\u00e9es par le tribunal Hadjis.\n[136] Le plaignant est d'avis que les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s que le minist\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu de corriger auraient d\u00fb avoir pour r\u00e9sultat une nouvelle prise en compte de sa candidature au poste, outre celle du Dr Casorso, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9 d'appel de la Commission de la fonction publique profite \u00e0 chacun des candidats, et, si le minist\u00e8re n'a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec le plaignant, alors il faut consid\u00e9rer cela comme une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[137] Selon l'avocat du plaignant, le Dr Chopra aurait d\u00fb se voir offrir la possibilit\u00e9 de participer au nouveau concours, et, si le plaignant avait eu la possibilit\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des mesures correctives, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 admis dans le concours et aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 au poste en question apr\u00e8s les mesures correctives.\n[138] D'apr\u00e8s la preuve, le Dr Breton, de m\u00eame que le Dr Chopra et le Dr Casorso, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9s du premier concours parce qu'ils n'avaient pas l'exp\u00e9rience de la gestion ni l'exp\u00e9rience de repr\u00e9sentant du minist\u00e8re aupr\u00e8s des m\u00e9dias, deux conditions essentielles pour qu'un candidat f\u00fbt admis dans le concours. Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le aussi que le Dr Chopra et le Dr Casorso ont fait appel de la d\u00e9cision et que l'appel du Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9, tandis que celui du Dr Casorso a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli.\n[139] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le aussi que, apr\u00e8s que le Dr Casorso eut obtenu gain de cause dans son appel, le Dr Scott fut inform\u00e9 des mesures correctives destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux conclusions du comit\u00e9 d'appel. La preuve montre que nul n'a rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Chopra apr\u00e8s que le Dr Casorso eut obtenu gain de cause dans son appel. En fait, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, \u00e0 l'exception du Dr Casorso, aucun des candidats qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9s la premi\u00e8re fois n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9. Le Dr Breton, qui n'est pas membre d'une minorit\u00e9 visible, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lui-m\u00eame n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que l'appel du Dr Casorso fut accueilli.\n[140] Dans ses observations orales, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir qu'il n'y avait aucune raison pour l'intim\u00e9 de communiquer avec le Dr Breton ou le Dr Chopra. Ce dernier s'\u00e9tait plaint de partialit\u00e9 devant le comit\u00e9 d'appel. Le dossier montre que, devant le comit\u00e9 d'appel, il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir acquis de l'exp\u00e9rience consid\u00e9rable aupr\u00e8s des m\u00e9dias dans le secteur priv\u00e9. Le comit\u00e9 d'appel avait relev\u00e9 que l'exp\u00e9rience requise pour le poste \u00e9tait une exp\u00e9rience en tant que repr\u00e9sentant minist\u00e9riel aupr\u00e8s d'organismes externes. Le comit\u00e9 avait rejet\u00e9 l'id\u00e9e selon laquelle l'exp\u00e9rience acquise par le Dr Chopra aupr\u00e8s des m\u00e9dias en tant que particulier avait la m\u00eame valeur que l'exp\u00e9rience en tant que repr\u00e9sentant minist\u00e9riel aupr\u00e8s des m\u00e9dias. Dans le cas du Dr Chopra, l'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente et notable acquise au cours des cinq \u00e0 dix ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur d\u00e9cisif.\n[141] Selon le dossier, l'une des mesures correctives avait trait \u00e0 l'\u00e9limination des crit\u00e8res temporels d'apr\u00e8s lesquels l'exp\u00e9rience de la gestion d'une organisation scientifique, m\u00e9dicale ou v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire dot\u00e9e de programmes \u00e0 volets multiples devait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise au cours des dix ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures et avoir dur\u00e9 au moins cinq ans.\n[142] Appel\u00e9 \u00e0 dire si, avec l'\u00e9limination des crit\u00e8res, c'est-\u00e0-dire des exigences susmentionn\u00e9es de dix ans et cinq ans, il pensait qu'il aurait r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l'exigence relative \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9rience, c'est-\u00e0-dire s'il avait l'exp\u00e9rience de la gestion d'une organisation scientifique, m\u00e9dicale ou v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire dot\u00e9e de programmes \u00e0 volets multiples, le Dr Chopra a dit qu'on aurait d\u00fb lui donner l'occasion, comme au Dr Casorso, de se pr\u00e9senter devant le comit\u00e9 pour lui expliquer en quoi il r\u00e9pondait aux qualifications \u00e0 l'origine de son \u00e9limination, et qu'il poss\u00e9dait de l'exp\u00e9rience pr\u00e9alable, une formation en gestion et une exp\u00e9rience pratique dans la formation de gestionnaires afin d'en faire de meilleurs gestionnaires dans une organisation scientifique et m\u00e9dicale. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Chopra a aussi fait valoir qu'une exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire parce qu'il avait fait le travail, qu'il avait re\u00e7u une formation et avait les connaissances requises, qu'il r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 l'exigence d'une exp\u00e9rience des m\u00e9dias et qu'il avait une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licate de composer avec les situations.\n[143] Il convient de noter ici que, dans sa d\u00e9cision de 2001, M. Hadjis avait conclu que le Dr Chopra n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime d'un traitement d\u00e9favorable au regard du concours pour le poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Scott. M. Hadjis avait estim\u00e9 sur ce point que, m\u00eame s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection en raison de son manque d'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion, on a \u00e9galement jug\u00e9 qu'il ne r\u00e9pondait pas au deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re sur le plan de l'exp\u00e9rience, \u00e0 savoir les relations avec les organismes externes. On n'a produit aucune preuve indiquant que le Dr Chopra satisfaisait en fait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re ou que le fait qu'il ne poss\u00e9dait pas cette exp\u00e9rience \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 un comportement discriminatoire de la part de l'intim\u00e9. M. Hadjis avait conclu que, selon lui, le Dr Chopra n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste (d\u00e9cision Hadjis, paragraphe 288). Durant son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Chopra a dit qu'il ne partageait pas les conclusions de M. Hadjis au regard de son exp\u00e9rience des m\u00e9dias.\n[144] Le Tribunal estime que, m\u00eame si l'on avait communiqu\u00e9 avec le Dr Chopra apr\u00e8s que le Dr Casorso eut obtenu gain de cause dans son appel, il n'aurait pas pour autant r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l'une des conditions essentielles du poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, compte tenu de la conclusion de M. Hadjis.\n[145] Le Tribunal estime donc que le plaignant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 prima facie la discrimination au regard de cet aspect de la nomination du Dr Scott. Le simple fait que l'on n'ait pas communiqu\u00e9 avec le Dr Chopra ne suffit pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Le Tribunal estime que, m\u00eame si le plaignant a raison de dire qu'on aurait d\u00fb communiquer avec lui apr\u00e8s la mise en uvre des mesures correctives, aucun fait mat\u00e9riel \u00e9tabli n'ajoute foi \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle, si l'on n'a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec lui, c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 cause de son origine ethnique. La preuve montre que le Dr Breton, qui n'est pas membre d'une minorit\u00e9 visible, n'a pas lui non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la mise en uvre des mesures correctives.\n[146] Le Tribunal estime en outre que, si l'on n'a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec le Dr Chopra apr\u00e8s que le Dr Casorso eut obtenu gain de cause dans son appel, il ne saurait pour autant s'agir d'une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de Sant\u00e9 Canada. Comme je le disais plus haut, l'article 14.1 de la Loi n'est entr\u00e9 en vigueur que le 30 juin 1998 et il n'avait aucun effet r\u00e9troactif.\n[147] Finalement, le Tribunal estime qu'aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e concernant l'\u00e9limination du poste de chef de la Division du syst\u00e8me nerveux central et concernant le pr\u00e9tendu objet de cette \u00e9limination, c'est-\u00e0-dire la volont\u00e9 d'emp\u00eacher le plaignant et d'autres membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires de poser leur candidature pour le poste \u00e0 la faveur d'un concours public. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n'examinera pas cet aspect.\nb) L'autonomination du Dr Paterson au poste de directeur du BMV (1997) [148] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, le 12 novembre 1996, le Dr Scott a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9, \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire, par le Dr Landry, chef de la Division de l'\u00e9valuation pharmaceutique, comme directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires. Le dossier montre que le Dr Yong avait occup\u00e9 ce poste durant quatre mois avant le Dr Landry.\n[149] Le Dr Chopra, qui, en f\u00e9vrier 1997, avait achev\u00e9 une affectation int\u00e9rimaire de quatre mois comme chef de la Division du syst\u00e8me nerveux central, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'on ne lui a pas donn\u00e9 l'occasion d'occuper ce poste par la suite, parce que, selon le Dr Chopra, le Dr Paterson, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, s'\u00e9tait nomm\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame directeur int\u00e9rimaire du Bureau. Selon le Dr Chopra, le Dr Paterson cumulait les deux postes, celui de directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et celui de directeur int\u00e9rimaire du BMV, jusqu'\u00e0 la nomination du Dr Lachance au poste de directeur en f\u00e9vrier 1998. Le Dr Chopra a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'aucun concours n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu pour doter le poste de directeur.\n[150] Les Drs Paterson et Lachance n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Cela dit, il s'agit de savoir, dans le cadre de la plainte actuelle, si les mesures prises par le minist\u00e8re \u00e9taient ou non discriminatoires, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment si la d\u00e9cision de ne pas doter le poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires ou d'attribuer des nominations int\u00e9rimaires \u00e0 d'autres personnes, y compris \u00e0 des \u00e9valuateurs du Bureau, \u00e9tait ou non discriminatoire.\n[151] Il convient de noter ici, au sujet du concours ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Scott, que le Dr Yong et le Dr Landry avaient tous deux \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9s en 1993 du concours tenu pour le poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, comme l'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le Dr Chopra, mais qu'ils ont n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9s \u00e0 occuper le poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires pour une certaine p\u00e9riode. La diff\u00e9rence qui retient l'attention, c'est que le Dr Yong et le Dr Landry \u00e9taient tous deux chefs, ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas le cas du Dr Chopra, et avaient une plus grande exp\u00e9rience de la gestion que le Dr Chopra, qui venait de terminer une affectation int\u00e9rimaire de quatre mois.\n[152] Par ailleurs, si le Dr Chopra \u00e9tait devenu directeur int\u00e9rimaire, il serait devenu le patron de son patron, le Dr Yong, une situation qui, du strict point de vue de la gestion, aurait pu \u00eatre probl\u00e9matique puisque, une fois achev\u00e9e l'affectation int\u00e9rimaire, le Dr Chopra serait retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste d'\u00e9valuateur de m\u00e9dicaments au sein de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains.\n[153] Le Tribunal est d'avis que la proc\u00e9dure normale consiste \u00e0 nommer le subalterne imm\u00e9diat, en l'occurrence le Dr Yong et le Dr Landry, qui \u00e9taient chefs, et ce, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'aucun des coll\u00e8gues du Dr Chopra, c'est-\u00e0-dire aucun des autres \u00e9valuateurs, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 occuper \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires. Le Tribunal convient avec l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 qu'il n'y a rien de fautif ou d'inhabituel en soi \u00e0 ce que la direction d\u00e9cide d'\u00e9liminer temporairement un niveau de gestion.\n[154] Cela dit, le Tribunal n'a pas \u00e0 se demander, quant \u00e0 la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l'occupation simultan\u00e9e de deux postes par le Dr Paterson, si Sant\u00e9 Canada se conformait ou non \u00e0 l'ordonnance rendue auparavant par le membre instructeur Groarke dans l'affaire ACNRI. Par ailleurs, la preuve montre que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'autonomination du Dr Paterson au poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, la Commission \u00e9tait en train de v\u00e9rifier si Sant\u00e9 Canada se conformait \u00e0 ladite ordonnance. La preuve montre que, selon la Commission, Sant\u00e9 Canada se conformait \u00e0 l'ordonnance. Aucune preuve du contraire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite.\n[155] Le Tribunal estime donc que, vu les circonstances, la d\u00e9cision du minist\u00e8re de n'inviter \u00e0 agir comme directeur du Bureau aucun des \u00e9valuateurs de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains ou de la Division de l'\u00e9valuation pharmaceutique, les deux seules divisions qui existaient \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque au sein du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 raisonnable et ne saurait \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de discriminatoire.\n[156] Le Tribunal estime donc que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination en ce qui concerne l'autonomination du Dr Paterson comme directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires pour une certaine p\u00e9riode en 1997.\nc) La nomination du Dr Lachance (1998) [157] Dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions annex\u00e9 \u00e0 sa plainte modifi\u00e9e, le plaignant \u00e9crit qu'on lui a une deuxi\u00e8me fois, le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998, refus\u00e9 des perspectives d'avancement. \u00c0 cette date, le Dr Paterson avait annonc\u00e9 que le Dr Andr\u00e9 Lachance occuperait le poste de directeur \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Dr Scott avait pris sa retraite. Selon le plaignant, le Dr Lachance venait lui aussi d'Agriculture Canada et n'avait pas la formation requise ni l'exp\u00e9rience des domaines d'activit\u00e9 du Bureau, \u00e0 savoir la science v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire et la r\u00e9glementation des m\u00e9dicaments. Le plaignant ajoute que l'Alliance de la capitale nationale sur les relations inter-raciales (l'ACNRI) s'\u00e9tait oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 sa nomination qui, selon elle, contrevenait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal rendue \u00e0 propos de la plainte de l'ACNRI.\n[158] Au sujet de la nomination du Dr Lachance, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations additionnelles le 27 juin 1999. Dans ces all\u00e9gations additionnelles, il \u00e9crit qu'il maintient que le Dr Lachance, qui est de race blanche, n'avait pas re\u00e7u la formation n\u00e9cessaire, comme un dipl\u00f4me en sciences v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, pour occuper le poste, et qu'il avait adress\u00e9 une objection au directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, George Paterson, \u00e0 propos de cette nomination. Le plaignant affirme ensuite que, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 son objection \u00e0 la nomination, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral avait ni\u00e9 qu'une telle sp\u00e9cialisation f\u00fbt requise.\n[159] Dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions annex\u00e9 \u00e0 sa plainte modifi\u00e9e, le plaignant \u00e9voque le fait qu'une p\u00e9tition avait circul\u00e9 concernant une remarque du Dr Lachance, remarque qui attestait une m\u00e9connaissance de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 culturelle. Au moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 officiellement aux employ\u00e9s du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998, le Dr Lachance avait dit qu'il aimait bien les minorit\u00e9s visibles. Le plaignant affirme dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions que, l\u00e0 encore, lui et d'autres candidats membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9s de poser leur candidature \u00e0 un poste pour lequel ils \u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9s, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de candidats de race blanche moins qualifi\u00e9s qui ont obtenu le poste sans devoir se soumettre \u00e0 un concours.\n[160] Les Drs Paterson, Scott et Lachance n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. S'agissant du Dr Lachance, on s'est interrog\u00e9 sur l'opportunit\u00e9 de l'appeler \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, au d\u00e9but, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 voulait produire un rapport m\u00e9dical qui aurait \u00e9tabli l'impossibilit\u00e9 pour le Dr Lachance de t\u00e9moigner, vu son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Le Tribunal n'a jamais vu le rapport. L'avocat du plaignant s'est oppos\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t du rapport et a exig\u00e9 que le m\u00e9decin qui l'avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 soit tenu de t\u00e9moigner afin d'\u00eatre contre-interrog\u00e9 par l'avocat du plaignant. Finalement, ni le Dr Lachance ni son m\u00e9decin n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Dans ses observations finales, l'avocat du plaignant a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de consid\u00e9rer d\u00e9favorablement le fait que l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pas appel\u00e9 le Dr Lachance \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et avait refus\u00e9 d'appeler son m\u00e9decin \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[161] La preuve montre que, s'agissant de la nomination du Dr Lachance, une p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, selon les auteurs de la p\u00e9tition, la nomination du Dr Lachance \u00e9tait l'une des nombreuses nominations et promotions o\u00f9 le principe du m\u00e9rite n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9. Les auteurs de la p\u00e9tition se plaignaient de ce que le Dr Lachance arrivait d'Agriculture Canada pour remplacer sans concours le Dr Scott, alors que le Dr Scott avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d'un concours.\n[162] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s la nomination du Dr Lachance, il avait \u00e9mis des doutes sur sa nomination. Ses doutes portaient d'abord sur les titres de comp\u00e9tence du Dr Lachance et ensuite sur les remarques qu'il avait formul\u00e9es lors d'une r\u00e9union apr\u00e8s sa nomination. Le Dr Chopra a dit aussi qu'il s'\u00e9tait plaint au Dr Paterson \u00e0 propos d'une culture organisationnelle insensible \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 raciale, une culture qui, malgr\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dans l'affaire ACNRI, demeurait pr\u00e9sente au sein de la haute direction du minist\u00e8re. Le Dr Chopra a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le Dr Paterson n'avait pas \u00e9voqu\u00e9 avec lui la question de savoir si la nomination du Dr Lachance s'accordait ou non avec l'ordonnance rendue dans l'affaire ACNRI. Selon le Dr Chopra, le Dr Paterson faisait partie du probl\u00e8me \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[163] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa conviction que le Dr Lachance n'avait pas la formation requise ni l'exp\u00e9rience des domaines d'activit\u00e9 du Bureau, \u00e0 savoir la science v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire et la r\u00e9glementation des m\u00e9dicaments. Il a aussi exprim\u00e9 la conviction que lui et d'autres candidats membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9s de poser leur candidature \u00e0 un poste pour lequel ils \u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9s, et cela au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de candidats de race blanche moins qualifi\u00e9s, qui avaient obtenu le poste sans passer par un concours.\n[164] Le Dr Chopra a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'on ne l'avait jamais rencontr\u00e9 pour savoir s'il \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par le poste de directeur, \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire, avant que la nomination ne soit faite et il a exprim\u00e9 l'avis qu'on aurait d\u00fb penser \u00e0 lui.\n[165] Au sujet de l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s aff\u00e9rent au poste de directeur, le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 dire s'il r\u00e9pondait aux conditions de candidature pour la p\u00e9riode de 1996 \u00e0 1998. Le Dr Chopra a r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait le niveau d'\u00e9tudes requis, ainsi que le niveau d'exp\u00e9rience requis. Fort de l'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion qu'il avait acquise comme chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division du syst\u00e8me nerveux central, durant quatre mois, d'octobre 1996 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 1997, il estimait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toutes les conditions de candidature au regard de l'exp\u00e9rience.\n[166] Le Dr Chopra a aussi soutenu qu'il avait \u00e9galement les connaissances requises, ainsi que la formation requise. Il a affirm\u00e9, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au Programme de perfectionnement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs (PPCS), que personne n'avait re\u00e7u la formation structur\u00e9e qu'il avait re\u00e7ue. S'agissant de la connaissance des techniques de gestion, le Dr Chopra a invoqu\u00e9 son exp\u00e9rience en dehors du minist\u00e8re, ajoutant qu'il \u00e9tait pleinement au fait de l'\u00e9valuation et du suivi des r\u00e9sidus de m\u00e9dicaments, qu'il avait une connaissance approfondie des programmes et activit\u00e9s existants de 1996 \u00e0 1998, ainsi que de la Loi sur les aliments et drogues et de son r\u00e8glement d'application. Le Dr Chopra a dit aussi qu'il avait une exp\u00e9rience consid\u00e9rable de la gestion des ressources tant humaines que financi\u00e8res et la capacit\u00e9 de g\u00e9rer ces ressources, \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit, et qu'il r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 toutes les autres caract\u00e9ristiques li\u00e9es aux aptitudes requises pour le poste, sans oublier les qualit\u00e9s personnelles.\n[167] Pour l'avocat du plaignant, la pr\u00e9sente affaire aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'occasion id\u00e9ale de promouvoir les minorit\u00e9s visibles, d'appliquer les principes de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi et de donner \u00e0 un membre des minorit\u00e9s visibles de l'exp\u00e9rience en gestion au lieu de permuter deux autres employ\u00e9s. Pour lui, les droits de la personne supplantent toute autre consid\u00e9ration.\n[168] \u00c0 propos de la nomination du Dr Lachance au poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, le Tribunal a entendu le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Gail Mclean. Mme Mclean \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque directrice des services ex\u00e9cutifs, \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[169] Mme Mclean a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le Dr Scott, un EX-2, voulait prendre sa retraite, mais qu'il ne voulait pas \u00eatre p\u00e9nalis\u00e9 financi\u00e8rement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas atteint l'\u00e2ge de la retraite ni ne poss\u00e9dait le nombre requis d'ann\u00e9es de service. Mme McLean a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, il existait un programme, le Programme d'\u00e9change de postes, qui permettait \u00e0 une personne sur le point de perdre son poste de prendre le poste d'une autre qui souhaitait prendre sa retraite. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, \u00e0 Agriculture Canada, le poste du Dr Lachance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 exc\u00e9dentaire. Mme McLean a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsque la d\u00e9cision fut prise de permuter le Dr Lachance et le Dr Scott, le minist\u00e8re n'avait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l'effet sur les minorit\u00e9s visibles. Mme Mclean a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 aussi que l'on avait jug\u00e9 que le Dr Lachance r\u00e9pondait aux exigences du poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires.\n[170] Mme Mclean a expliqu\u00e9 que, pour \u00eatre admissible \u00e0 une permutation, les deux candidats devaient \u00eatre du m\u00eame niveau de gestion. D'apr\u00e8s la preuve, le Dr Lachance \u00e9tait EX-2 \u00e0 Agriculture Canada. Mme Mclean a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le minist\u00e8re devait consid\u00e9rer une permutation avant d'effectuer une op\u00e9ration de dotation d'une autre nature, que ce soit une mutation ou un concours. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, le poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires n'\u00e9tait pas vacant. Mme Mclean a affirm\u00e9 aussi que la d\u00e9cision de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une permutation \u00e9tait sans rapport avec le Dr Chopra et que c'est le Dr Scott qui en avait eu l'id\u00e9e. Le Tribunal juge cr\u00e9dible le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Mclean. M\u00eame si le Dr Paterson n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, la preuve montre que Mme Mclean est intervenue directement et imm\u00e9diatement dans la permutation du Dr Landry et du Dr Scott.\n[171] La preuve montre que la permutation a pris effet le 31 mars 1998, apr\u00e8s que le Dr Scott eut quitt\u00e9 Sant\u00e9 Canada et que le Dr Lachance eut accept\u00e9 l'offre de devenir directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires.\n[172] Le Tribunal juge que, vu la proc\u00e9dure de permutation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e pour nommer le Dr Lachance, vu le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Mclean sur les raisons qui avaient motiv\u00e9 le recours \u00e0 cette proc\u00e9dure, c'est-\u00e0-dire le d\u00e9sir du Dr Scott de prendre sa retraite, vu son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel la d\u00e9cision de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une permutation \u00e9tait sans aucun rapport avec le Dr Chopra, le plaignant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination. Le contexte et les circonstances entourant le d\u00e9part du Dr Scott de Sant\u00e9 Canada et l'arriv\u00e9e du Dr Lachance ne laissent voir aucune volont\u00e9 de discrimination de la part de Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[173] Le Tribunal estime donc qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire de la part du minist\u00e8re de ne pas offrir au Dr Chopra la possibilit\u00e9 de poser sa candidature au poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires et que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise pour v\u00e9ritablement rendre service au Dr Scott.\nd) La nomination du Dr Alexander (1999) [174] Dans ses all\u00e9gations additionnelles dat\u00e9es du 26 juin 1999, le plaignant \u00e9crit que, lors d'une r\u00e9union tenue le 2 juin 1999 avec Mme Kerrie Strachan, agente des ressources humaines pour la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (et ancienne coordonnatrice des droits de la personne), il a \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9 que le minist\u00e8re proc\u00e9derait \u00e0 une nomination de quatre mois qui n'\u00e9tait assortie d'aucun droit d'appel. Le plaignant ajoute que Mme Strachan avait annonc\u00e9 que, \u00e0 la fin des quatre mois, le poste serait ouvert et un concours, avec examen et jury de s\u00e9lection, aurait lieu. Il ajoute que, lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9e sur l'ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal dans l'affaire ACNRI et sur la transgression de cette ordonnance, Mme Strachan a refus\u00e9 de d\u00e9battre la question et la r\u00e9union a alors pris fin.\n[175] Le plaignant \u00e9crit ensuite qu'il croit que cette nomination, de m\u00eame que les possibilit\u00e9s qui lui furent refus\u00e9es auparavant, en 1997 et 1998, sont manifestement discriminatoires et contreviennent d'une mani\u00e8re flagrante \u00e0 l'ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dans l'affaire ACNRI, qui obligeait Sant\u00e9 Canada \u00e0 \u00e9laborer des pratiques propres \u00e0 supprimer les barri\u00e8res syst\u00e9miques \u00e0 l'avancement des employ\u00e9s membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles et propres \u00e0 corriger la discrimination pass\u00e9e. Pour le plaignant, il est clair qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas pressenti pour les postes, que le minist\u00e8re n'allait pas annuler la nomination du Dr Alexander et que le minist\u00e8re avait pris des mesures qui constituaient des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son encontre parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de violation des droits de la personne, en ce sens qu'il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour occuper les postes en question et qu'il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9 en raison de la plainte de harc\u00e8lement qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[176] Dans ses all\u00e9gations additionnelles dat\u00e9es du 26 juin 1999, le plaignant r\u00e9affirme que, en mai 1999, le Dr Lachance a nomm\u00e9 le Dr Ian Alexander chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, pour une p\u00e9riode de quatre mois. Le plaignant fait aussi part de sa conviction que le Dr Alexander, qui est de race blanche, n'avait ni l'exp\u00e9rience ni les \u00e9tudes requises pour le poste.\n[177] La preuve montre que, le 6 mai 1999, on a annonc\u00e9, lors d'une r\u00e9union de tout le personnel, que le Dr Yong, chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, serait en affectation durant un an et que, \u00e0 compter du 5 mai 1999, le Dr Ian Alexander serait le chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, durant une p\u00e9riode de quatre mois. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, au sein du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, le Dr Alexander \u00e9tait \u00e9valuateur \u00e0 la Division de l'\u00e9valuation pharmaceutique et relevait du Dr Landry, tandis que le Dr Chopra \u00e9tait \u00e9valuateur \u00e0 la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains et relevait du Dr Yong. La preuve montre aussi que, avant d'\u00eatre offert au Dr Alexander, le poste int\u00e9rimaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 un membre d'une minorit\u00e9 visible, \u00e0 savoir le Dr Sharma, \u00e9valuateur \u00e0 la Division de l'\u00e9valuation pharmaceutique, mais qu'il a refus\u00e9 l'affectation int\u00e9rimaire.\n[178] La preuve montre que, s'agissant du poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, Sant\u00e9 Canada avait d'abord song\u00e9 \u00e0 pourvoir ce poste en y affectant un employ\u00e9 participant au Programme Cours et affectations de perfectionnement (CAP), que le seul candidat qualifi\u00e9 et disponible n'\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par ce poste en tant qu'affectation CAP, que la d\u00e9cision fut prise de conduire un concours interne pour un poste int\u00e9rimaire d'environ un an, ainsi que de nommer quelqu'un au poste durant une br\u00e8ve p\u00e9riode pendant l'administration du concours, et que, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de certaines modifications projet\u00e9es au sein de l'organisation, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, avant de faire conna\u00eetre cette affectation int\u00e9rimaire, la classification du poste serait pass\u00e9e en revue.\n[179] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Chopra a affirm\u00e9 qu'aucun avis n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 pour le poste int\u00e9rimaire de chef, qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de la proposition d'organiser un concours pour la nomination int\u00e9rimaire, qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 poser sa candidature et qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pressenti pour le poste. Le Dr Chopra a soutenu avoir eu connaissance apr\u00e8s coup de la nomination du Dr Alexander. Le Dr Chopra a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 aussi que le Dr Alexander n'avait pas travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, qu'il n'avait pas les qualit\u00e9s requises pour les postes et n'avait aucune exp\u00e9rience s'y rapportant et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 sans concours, par d\u00e9cision du Dr Lachance. Le Dr Chopra a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par ailleurs, durant son t\u00e9moignage, qu'il \u00e9tait le plus qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste, qu'il avait r\u00e9cemment acquis de l'exp\u00e9rience de la gestion hi\u00e9rarchique, puisqu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 chef, durant quatre mois, au sein de l'une des Divisions de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les animaux. Le Dr Chopra a \u00e9galement ajout\u00e9 que le poste se trouvait directement dans son domaine imm\u00e9diat de comp\u00e9tence, qu'il \u00e9tait le sp\u00e9cialiste dans ce domaine et qu'il justifiait d'une exp\u00e9rience internationale puisqu'il avait obtenu une bourse de l'OMS.\n[180] Le Dr Chopra a affirm\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage qu'il aurait bien voulu occuper en 1999 le poste de chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait trouv\u00e9 \u00e9trange que, dans une note de K. Strachan, des Ressources humaines, le 30 avril 2003, plusieurs ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la nomination du Dr Alexander comme chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, on puisse lire, s'agissant des raisons pour lesquelles des employ\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis en mai 1999 pour occuper le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, que le Dr Lachance essayait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de s'assurer que les employ\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9s \u00e0 occuper le poste n'entendaient pas poser leur candidature au poste quand il allait \u00eatre pourvu en permanence, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 garantir l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la nomination permanente. Selon le Dr Chopra, on proc\u00e8de aux nominations int\u00e9rimaires et ensuite, le plus souvent, dans 93 p. 100 des cas, celui qui occupe le poste int\u00e9rimaire obtient la permanence.\n[181] La preuve montre que le Dr Chopra s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Alexander, la jugeant discriminatoire et en contradiction flagrante avec l'ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal dans l'affaire ACNRI. Une lettre en ce sens, dat\u00e9e du 31 mai 1999, sign\u00e9e par le Dr Chopra et deux autres \u00e9valuateurs, a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e au pr\u00e9sident de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Dans la lettre, le Dr Chopra et ses coll\u00e8gues demandent que la nomination du Dr Alexander soit annul\u00e9e et que la m\u00eame nomination soit offerte \u00e0 des membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles travaillant \u00e0 la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains.\n[182] \u00c0 l'audience, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a contest\u00e9 l'affirmation du Dr Chopra selon laquelle Sant\u00e9 Canada avait transgress\u00e9 l'ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal dans l'affaire ACNRI, et il s'est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue ant\u00e9rieurement par le membre instructeur Groarke, o\u00f9 celui-ci avait jug\u00e9 que toute question de conformit\u00e9 devait \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Pour sa part, l'avocat du plaignant a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas dans son intention de poser la question de savoir si l'ordonnance rendue dans l'affaire ACNRI avait \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9e ou non.\n[183] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 8 juin 1999, le bureau du pr\u00e9sident de la CCDP avait r\u00e9pondu que l'ordonnance rendue dans l'affaire ACNRI obligeait Sant\u00e9 Canada \u00e0 \u00e9laborer des programmes et pratiques propres \u00e0 supprimer les obstacles syst\u00e9miques qui avaient emp\u00each\u00e9 l'avancement des employ\u00e9s membres de minorit\u00e9s visibles et \u00e0 lancer des initiatives propres \u00e0 corriger la discrimination pass\u00e9e. Le pr\u00e9sident ajoutait que l'objectif global de l'ordonnance \u00e9tait de veiller \u00e0 ce que les minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada soient suffisamment repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. On peut lire ensuite dans la lettre que l'ordonnance du Tribunal n'interdit pas la promotion de candidats n'appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible. La lettre mentionne ensuite que l'objet de la fonction de suivi exerc\u00e9e par la Commission d'apr\u00e8s l'ordonnance du Tribunal est d'\u00e9valuer si Sant\u00e9 Canada fait des progr\u00e8s acceptables en vue de l'observation des mesures permanentes et temporaires d\u00e9crites dans l'ordonnance du Tribunal et que, \u00e0 la date de la lettre, l'analyse de la Commission montrait que, dans l'ensemble, un tel progr\u00e8s se voyait.\n[184] Compte tenu de la lettre envoy\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne au Dr Chopra, o\u00f9 il est clairement indiqu\u00e9 que Sant\u00e9 Canada, en nommant le Dr Alexander chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, ne transgressait pas l'ordonnance du Tribunal rendue dans l'affaire ACNRI, le Tribunal prend note du fait que Sant\u00e9 Canada n'a pas contrevenu \u00e0 l'ordonnance ACNRI lorsque le minist\u00e8re a nomm\u00e9 le Dr Alexander chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains.\n[185] Par ailleurs, le Tribunal estime que le plaignant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination au regard de la nomination, en mai 1999, du Dr Alexander au poste de chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains. Le dossier montre que le Dr Alexander avait l'exp\u00e9rience et la formation requises pour occuper ce poste. Le Dr Chopra a pu penser qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, mais une simple impression ne suffit pas \u00e0 constituer une preuve prima facie de discrimination\n[186] Cela dit, le Tribunal estime qu'il convient de noter que le Dr Chopra a \u00e9crit dans un document que le Dr Alexander avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 chef int\u00e9rimaire pour harceler les employ\u00e9s de la division. Cette id\u00e9e montre clairement que, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, le Dr Chopra \u00e9tait mal dispos\u00e9 envers le Dr Alexander. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du Dr Chopra s'en trouve amoindrie au regard de toute all\u00e9gation de discrimination r\u00e9sultant de la nomination du Dr Alexander.\n[187] S'agissant de l'affirmation du Dr Chopra selon laquelle la nomination constituait une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles, le Tribunal estime que le Dr Chopra n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 en quoi la nomination du Dr Alexander avait valeur de repr\u00e9sailles. Selon le Tribunal, le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9tabli que la nomination du Dr Alexander en mai 1999 comme chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains constitue de la part de Sant\u00e9 Canada une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles en r\u00e9ponse au d\u00e9p\u00f4t, par le Dr Chopra, d'une plainte relative aux droits de la personne.\ne) La nomination du Dr Butler (1999) [188] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, en juillet 1999, le Dr Kelly Butler, chef de la Banque nationale de produits biologiques \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, s'est vu offrir une mutation au poste de chef de la nouvelle Division des politiques et des programmes. Selon la preuve, une mutation est le d\u00e9placement d'un employ\u00e9 d'un poste \u00e0 un autre poste du m\u00eame groupe professionnel. La preuve montre que le Dr Chopra et certains de ses coll\u00e8gues ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief devant la Commission de la fonction publique du Canada \u00e0 l'encontre de la mutation du Dr Butler et que leur grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli, l'enqu\u00eateur dans le dossier \u00e9tant arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion, le 9 novembre 2000, que la mutation du Dr Butler n'\u00e9tait pas conforme \u00e0 la Loi sur l'emploi dans la fonction publique.\n[189] La preuve montre aussi que, \u00e0 compter du 20 septembre 1999 et pour une p\u00e9riode de quatre mois, jusqu'au 17 janvier 2000, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9e chef de la nouvelle Division des politiques et des programmes, le Dr Butler avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains par le Dr Lachance. Le Dr Butler rempla\u00e7ait le Dr Alexander dans le poste int\u00e9rimaire. La preuve montre aussi que le Dr Butler a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 nouveau chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, du 17 janvier 2000 au 16 mai 2000, en attendant la classification de ce poste entreprise en d\u00e9cembre 1999, et qu'elle devait occuper le poste de directrice int\u00e9rimaire du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires durant l'absence du Dr Lachance, c'est-\u00e0-dire de janvier 2000 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2000.\n[190] Appel\u00e9 \u00e0 dire pourquoi il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 nouveau, le 20 septembre 1999, de pourvoir le poste occup\u00e9 par le Dr Alexander, le Dr Chopra a dit que c'\u00e9tait parce que l'int\u00e9rim du Dr Alexander avait expir\u00e9, de telle sorte qu'il devait \u00eatre prolong\u00e9 ou que quelqu'un d'autre devait \u00eatre nomm\u00e9. Le Dr Chopra a affirm\u00e9 aussi, dans son t\u00e9moignage, que le Dr Butler venait de l'ext\u00e9rieur du Bureau, qu'elle n'avait jamais travaill\u00e9 au sein du Bureau, qu'elle n'avait aucune id\u00e9e ni aucune connaissance du travail de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains et que, selon lui, elle n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9e. Appel\u00e9 \u00e0 dire s'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 occup\u00e9 le poste de chef de la Division, le Dr Chopra a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait occup\u00e9 ce poste en 1988 durant environ six semaines, avant la nomination du Dr Yong, et par la suite, \u00e0 certaines reprises, lorsqu'on le lui demandait, jusqu'en 1992 environ.\n[191] Appel\u00e9 \u00e0 dire ce qu'il pensait de la nomination du Dr Butler, le Dr Chopra a soutenu qu'il n'approuvait pas cette nomination parce que c'\u00e9tait lui qui \u00e9tait le scientifique ayant le plus d'anciennet\u00e9 au sein de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, mais on ne lui avait jamais demand\u00e9 d'occuper le poste, c'\u00e9tait toujours quelqu'un qui \u00e9tait de race blanche et qui venait de l'ext\u00e9rieur de la Division, d'abord le Dr Alexander, puis le Dr Butler, lesquels n'\u00e9taient, ni l'un ni l'autre, selon le Dr Chopra, qualifi\u00e9s pour travailler dans cette Division.\n[192] Selon le Dr Chopra, le Dr Butler n'\u00e9tait pas bilingue alors que le titulaire du poste devait \u00eatre bilingue. Appel\u00e9 \u00e0 dire si, selon lui, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 pour occuper le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, le Dr Chopra a r\u00e9pondu que, puisqu'il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 en 1988 et avait occup\u00e9 le poste par intervalles, alors, m\u00eame du point de vue de Sant\u00e9 Canada, il aurait certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9.\n[193] Le Dr Chopra a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait le candidat le plus qualifi\u00e9, qu'il avait, selon ses \u00e9valuations, toutes les qualit\u00e9s scientifiques, l'entregent et les aptitudes \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation, qu'il \u00e9tait courtois et bilingue, qu'il avait de l'exp\u00e9rience internationale, qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 boursier de l'OMS, qu'il avait une formation en gestion, procur\u00e9e par la Commission de la fonction publique, qu'il avait travaill\u00e9 comme formateur de gestionnaires \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada durant trois ans. Le Dr Chopra a fait observer aussi que le Dr Lachance, qui avait formul\u00e9 des remarques racistes, nommait une personne de race blanche au poste m\u00eame qui se trouvait dans son voisinage imm\u00e9diat et relevait de son autorit\u00e9 imm\u00e9diate.\n[194] Au sujet des nominations du Dr Alexander et du Dr Kelly faites par le Dr Lachance, l'avocat du plaignant a fait valoir que, les deux fois, le Dr Chopra s'\u00e9tait vu refuser l'occasion d'occuper un poste de direction. L'avocat du plaignant a aussi fait valoir qu'il \u00e9tait troublant que le minist\u00e8re refuse au Dr Chopra l'occasion d'occuper ce poste, en accordant ce poste au Dr Butler, alors que celle-ci occupait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un autre poste, voire deux autres postes, et qu'elle \u00e9tait nouvelle au Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires. Pour lui, la question \u00e0 laquelle il faut r\u00e9pondre est la suivante : pourquoi ne donnerait-on pas dans ces conditions le poste int\u00e9rimaire au Dr Chopra? Pour l'avocat du plaignant, la conduite des gestionnaires de Sant\u00e9 Canada soul\u00e8ve des doutes sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re et sur la question de la discrimination.\n[195] L'avocat du plaignant affirme qu'il y avait un poste \u00e0 la disposition du Dr Chopra, que le Dr Chopra \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour l'occuper, que d'autres se sont vu accorder le poste \u00e0 plusieurs reprises et que ces nominations \u00e9taient motiv\u00e9es par des consid\u00e9rations raciales. Par ailleurs, pour l'avocat du plaignant, le minist\u00e8re n'a pas donn\u00e9 d'explication valide des raisons pour lesquelles le Dr Chopra n'avait pas eu la chance d'occuper le poste. L'avocat du plaignant affirme \u00e9galement que tout cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 de la discrimination et il souligne que les conclusions tir\u00e9es par le tribunal dans l'affaire ACNRI et par le tribunal Hadjis avaient clairement \u00e9tabli le fait que Sant\u00e9 Canada \u00e9tait une organisation o\u00f9 existait de la discrimination raciale \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque des faits vis\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[196] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9, pour sa part, a fait valoir que, m\u00eame si la preuve montre que le Dr Chopra n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 poser sa candidature au poste int\u00e9rimaire et qu'aucun concours n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9, cela ne signifie pas qu'il y a eu discrimination. Tout comme le Dr Chopra n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 poser sa candidature au poste int\u00e9rimaire, aucun de ses coll\u00e8gues de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains ne l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 non plus, ni d'ailleurs aucun autre employ\u00e9, qu'il f\u00fbt partie ou non des minorit\u00e9s visibles. Tout le monde a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on.\n[197] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a fait aussi valoir que Sant\u00e9 Canada n'\u00e9tait pas tenu d'offrir au Dr Chopra n'importe quel poste int\u00e9rimaire qui pouvait se pr\u00e9senter et le fait que le poste ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 offert, qu'il f\u00fbt qualifi\u00e9 ou non pour l'occuper, ne constitue pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Pour une raison quelconque, de dire l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9, Sant\u00e9 Canada n'a offert le poste \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 aucun des employ\u00e9s de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains et une preuve prima facie n'est pas pour autant \u00e9tablie.\n[198] La question ici n'est pas de savoir si le Dr Chopra aurait d\u00fb ou non devenir, ou serait ou non devenu, chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, au sein du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, mais de savoir s'il s'est vu ou non refuser un poste int\u00e9rimaire en raison de sa race ou de son origine ethnique. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'importe pas de savoir si les deux personnes qui ont occup\u00e9 par int\u00e9rim le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains en 1998 ont obtenu le poste plus tard. La question est la suivante : le Dr Chopra, qui manifestait depuis des ann\u00e9es de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les postes de direction et qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 occup\u00e9 par int\u00e9rim le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains (1988) ainsi que le poste de chef de la Division des m\u00e9dicaments endocriniens, antiparasitiques et du syst\u00e8me nerveux central (1996-1997), s'est-il vu refuser le poste int\u00e9rimaire en raison de son origine ethnique?\n[199] La nomination du Dr Butler au poste de chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains soul\u00e8ve plusieurs questions. Le Dr Butler a \u00e9t\u00e9, en juillet 1999, nomm\u00e9e chef d'une nouvelle division, la Division des politiques et des programmes. Le Dr Butler venait de l'ext\u00e9rieur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, ce qui, d'apr\u00e8s le dossier, n'est pas en soi inhabituel. Cela dit, il lui aurait fallu quelque temps pour s'adapter \u00e0 ses nouvelles t\u00e2ches et pour g\u00e9rer la division efficacement.\n[200] Or, le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, d\u00e8s septembre 1999, le Dr Butler a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 occuper le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains durant une p\u00e9riode de quatre mois, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait chef de la Division des politiques et des programmes. Par ailleurs, selon le dossier, en janvier 2000, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 occuper le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains tout en demeurant chef de la Division des politiques et des programmes et, en outre, elle devait agir simultan\u00e9ment en tant que directrice du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires en l'absence du Dr Lachance.\n[201] Le Tribunal trouve \u00e9trange qu'autant de t\u00e2ches aient pu \u00eatre confi\u00e9es simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 une personne nouvellement arriv\u00e9e au Bureau. Le Dr Butler n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, ni le Dr Lachance, pour expliquer au Tribunal pourquoi elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme la seule personne pouvant combler les vacances temporaires du poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains. Vu que le Dr Lachance a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 ces nominations, et puisque le Dr Lachance n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, le Tribunal n'a pu se faire expliquer la logique et le fondement de l'attribution de ces divers postes int\u00e9rimaires \u00e0 une seule personne, nouvelle au Bureau, si ce n'est la raison donn\u00e9e quatre ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s le fait par Mme Strachan, dans une note dat\u00e9e du 30 avril 2003. Comme je l'ai dit plus haut, dans sa note, Mme Strachan, qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, \u00e9crit, \u00e0 propos de la raison pour laquelle des employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis en mai 1999 pour occuper le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, que le Dr Lachance essayait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque d'inviter \u00e0 ce poste des employ\u00e9s qui ne souhaitaient pas poser leur candidature au poste lorsqu'il serait pourvu en permanence, pour que la nomination permanente paraisse \u00e9quitable. Le Tribunal juge \u00e9trange qu'une telle explication soit donn\u00e9e quatre ans apr\u00e8s le fait et, franchement, il trouve l'explication difficile \u00e0 croire.\n[202] Cela dit, le Tribunal ne saurait ignorer que les nominations int\u00e9rimaires \u00e9taient effectu\u00e9es par le Dr Lachance et que celui-ci \u00e9tait en d\u00e9saccord avec le Dr Chopra sur de nombreux points. En outre, le Tribunal ne saurait ignorer que le Dr Chopra avait montr\u00e9 peu de temps auparavant qu'il souhaitait acqu\u00e9rir de l'exp\u00e9rience en gestion, qu'il avait occup\u00e9 le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains en 1988, durant une p\u00e9riode de six semaines, qu'il avait occup\u00e9 le poste de chef de la Division du syst\u00e8me nerveux central durant une p\u00e9riode de quatre mois \u00e0 la fin de 1996 et au d\u00e9but de 1997, et qu'il avait donc acquis r\u00e9cemment de l'exp\u00e9rience en gestion. Le Tribunal ne saurait ignorer non plus que le Dr Lachance avait formul\u00e9 des commentaires \u00e0 connotation raciste lors d'une r\u00e9union du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires en f\u00e9vrier 1998. Finalement, le Tribunal ne saurait ignorer non plus que Sant\u00e9 Canada avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu de discrimination \u00e0 l'encontre du Dr Chopra et avait aussi fait l'objet d'une ordonnance dans l'affaire ACNRI, le tribunal saisi de ladite affaire ayant jug\u00e9 que les membres de minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e9taient victimes de discrimination dans leur acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des postes de direction. Ce sont l\u00e0 toutes des circonstances que le Tribunal ne peut laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[203] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, la preuve prima facie est la preuve qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9 (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons Sears Ltd. (O'Malley), [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536). Autrement dit, il s'agit d'une preuve qui, si elle est jug\u00e9e cr\u00e9dible et si elle n'est pas suivie d'une explication convaincante de la part de l'intim\u00e9, suffira au plaignant pour obtenir gain de cause.\n[204] Comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1988] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 2, si l'on conclut \u00e0 la discrimination \u00e0 partir de preuves circonstancielles \u00e0 l'appui du plaignant, la conclusion doit \u00eatre en accord avec l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination et en contradiction avec toute autre explication rationnelle. Dans des cas comme celui-ci, ainsi qu'on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Basi, tout d\u00e9pendra de la capacit\u00e9 d'un tribunal de tirer des conclusions (qui seront raisonnables, voire incontournables) de la conduite de l'employeur. Une fois lesdites conclusions tir\u00e9es, l'employeur a la charge d'expliquer ce qu'\u00e9taient ses motivations, plut\u00f4t que ce qu'elles semblaient \u00eatre.\n[205] Le Tribunal sait que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du Dr Chopra au regard des all\u00e9gations de discrimination qu'il a faites est en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cela dit, le Tribunal doit n\u00e9anmoins se demander si lesdites all\u00e9gations sont fond\u00e9es eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'ensemble de la preuve, y compris la preuve circonstancielle.\n[206] Le Tribunal croit que le Dr Chopra a produit une preuve prima facie de discrimination en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Butler comme chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains en septembre 1999. Le Tribunal rel\u00e8ve que le Dr Butler a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 nouveau chef de la Division en janvier 2000. Le Tribunal ne tirera cependant aucune conclusion sur cette nouvelle nomination, puisqu'elle ne fait pas partie de l'objet de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[207] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments probants et les preuves circonstancielles \u00e9tablissant prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination se rapportent au fait que le Dr Chopra avait affirm\u00e9 qu'il souhaitait acqu\u00e9rir de l'exp\u00e9rience en gestion, qu'il avait deux fois, par le pass\u00e9, occup\u00e9 le poste de chef, qu'il avait acquis r\u00e9cemment de l'exp\u00e9rience en gestion, qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9 victime de discrimination \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada en raison de son origine ethnique, que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, Sant\u00e9 Canada avait r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu, dans l'affaire ACNRI, de discrimination \u00e0 l'encontre des minorit\u00e9s visibles, que le Dr Lachance avait par le pass\u00e9 formul\u00e9 des commentaires \u00e0 caract\u00e8re raciste ou du moins \u00e0 connotation raciste, comme l'a conclu le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal, que le Dr Chopra et le Dr Lachance \u00e9taient en d\u00e9saccord sur les questions de discrimination et finalement que la raison donn\u00e9e dans la note de Mme Strachan pour justifier la conduite du Dr Lachance est difficile \u00e0 croire. Le Tribunal est d'avis que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s ensemble, suffisent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Le Tribunal croit qu'il y a ici un l\u00e9ger relent de discrimination.\n[208] Vu ces conclusions, l'intim\u00e9 avait la charge d'apporter une explication raisonnable, autre qu'un simple pr\u00e9texte, pouvant amener le Tribunal \u00e0 croire que la discrimination n'avait eu aucune part dans la d\u00e9cision de nommer le Dr Butler, en septembre 1999, au poste de chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains. Le Tribunal croit que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas apport\u00e9 cette explication.\n[209] Le Dr Lachance n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, ni le Dr Butler. Il ne suffit pas \u00e0 l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 de dire que Sant\u00e9 Canada peut nommer \u00e0 un poste qui bon lui semble. Il est possible que la d\u00e9cision de ne pas nommer le Dr Chopra f\u00fbt sans rapport aucun avec la discrimination et avec le bagage ethnique du Dr Chopra et f\u00fbt attribuable par exemple au fait que le Dr Chopra ne s'entendait pas avec ses coll\u00e8gues ou qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas disponible. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 affirme que personne d'autre, \u00e0 la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, ne s'est vu offrir le poste. Cela n'est pas une preuve convaincante que la s\u00e9lection n'\u00e9tait pas entach\u00e9e de discrimination. Il est possible que certains employ\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9s \u00e0 poser leur candidature et ont d\u00e9clin\u00e9 l'invitation. Qui sait? Qui peut le dire? L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas apport\u00e9 au Tribunal de preuve concr\u00e8te, il s'est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 invoquer diverses possibilit\u00e9s.\n[210] Le Tribunal estime donc que le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, en violation de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, parce qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 occuper le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains en septembre 1999.\n[211] Cette conclusion ne tranche pas cependant la question suivante : si le Dr Chopra avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains en septembre 1999, aurait-il \u00e9t\u00e9 plus tard nomm\u00e9 chef de cette division?\n[212] Dans ses observations finales, l'avocat du plaignant s'est fond\u00e9 sur l'arr\u00eat Morgan, ainsi que sur l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Chopra c. Canada (P.G.), 2007 CAF 268, pour affirmer que le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 employer afin de savoir si le Dr Chopra aurait ou non \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 plus tard \u00e0 un poste de chef ou de directeur est le suivant : il doit y avoir un rapport ou un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre le poste qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu et la discrimination (arr\u00eat Morgan, page 432).\n[213] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 cette question, le Tribunal ne saurait laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le fait que, en 2000, le Dr Chopra a \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve du courrier n\u00b0 810 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 administr\u00e9e pour le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains. Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le Dr Chopra a contest\u00e9 l'\u00e9preuve, qu'il disait discriminatoire, mais il n'a pas obtenu gain de cause. Le Dr Chopra n'a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de se faire valoir pour le poste permanent de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains.\n[214] Le Tribunal ne peut donc pas \u00e9tablir de lien de causalit\u00e9 entre le fait que le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination pour le poste de chef int\u00e9rimaire de la Division et le fait qu'il n'a pas obtenu le poste permanent de chef de la Division en 2000.\n(ii) Questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 des incidents pouvant \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s de discriminatoires [215] Dans sa plainte, le plaignant mentionne plusieurs incidents qui, dit-il, \u00e9taient discriminatoires. Ce sont les \u00e9v\u00e9nements suivants : les commentaires du Dr Lachance formul\u00e9s lors d'une r\u00e9union du personnel du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, la suspension de cinq jours que lui a impos\u00e9e le Dr Lachance dans le sillage de la conf\u00e9rence de Patrimoine Canada, la plainte Zohair, la plainte Elanco et le projet Flumequine. Le Tribunal examinera successivement chacun de ces incidents pour savoir s'ils ont valeur de discrimination, de repr\u00e9sailles ou de harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 l'encontre du Dr Chopra.\na) Les commentaires du Dr Lachance [216] Dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions accompagnant sa plainte, le plaignant mentionne qu'une p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9e, concernant une remarque du Dr Lachance qui traduisait une m\u00e9connaissance de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 culturelle. Lorsqu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998, le Dr Lachance avait dit qu'il aimait bien les minorit\u00e9s visibles. Dans ses all\u00e9gations additionnelles dat\u00e9es du 27 juin 1999, le plaignant ajoute qu'il avait discut\u00e9 des commentaires du Dr Lachance avec le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le Dr Paterson, et que celui-ci avait minimis\u00e9 la gravit\u00e9 des commentaires qui, selon le Dr Chopra, l'avaient bless\u00e9, lui et certains de ses coll\u00e8gues du Bureau.\n[217] Selon la preuve, le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998, le Dr Lachance, qui venait d'\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au personnel du Bureau par le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le Dr Paterson, comme futur directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, en remplacement du Dr Scott.\n[218] Selon le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Chopra, le Dr Lachance, au moment de se pr\u00e9senter, aurait dit, en regardant son auditoire, qu'il aimait bien les minorit\u00e9s visibles. Le Dr Chopra a affirm\u00e9, durant son t\u00e9moignage, qu'il avait trouv\u00e9 la remarque vexante, vu la d\u00e9cision rendue par un tribunal ant\u00e9rieur dans l'affaire ACNRI. Le Dr Chopra a exprim\u00e9 l'avis qu'il s'agissait l\u00e0 une remarque raciste.\n[219] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, le 10 f\u00e9vrier 1998, le Dr Chopra a envoy\u00e9 au Dr Paterson une note de service o\u00f9 il \u00e9crivait que les propos tenus par le Dr Lachance \u00e9taient des remarques de nature raciste, profond\u00e9ment insensibles, \u00e0 l'endroit des employ\u00e9s du Bureau qui \u00e9taient membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles. Le Dr Chopra ajoute dans sa note qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un exemple typique de la culture organisationnelle, une culture peu sensible \u00e0 la diversit\u00e9 raciale, qui, malgr\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure rendue dans l'affaire ACNRI, se retrouve encore parmi les cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de ce minist\u00e8re. Le Dr Chopra termine sa lettre en demandant que soit r\u00e9examin\u00e9e la nomination du Dr Lachance.\n[220] Le dossier montre \u00e9galement que, dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la note du Dr Chopra, le Dr Paterson a \u00e9mis un doute sur l'exactitude des propos cens\u00e9ment tenus par le Dr Lachance, en tentant de les placer dans leur contexte. Selon le Dr Paterson, le Dr Lachance voulait \u00e9tablir une bonne relation avec son nouveau personnel. Le Dr Paterson soulignait aussi le fait que les doutes du Dr Chopra concernant les commentaires du Dr Lachance n'\u00e9taient pas partag\u00e9s par l'ensemble des employ\u00e9s du Bureau. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le d'ailleurs que deux personnes qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 la r\u00e9union se sont d\u00e9solidaris\u00e9es des vues exprim\u00e9es par le Dr Chopra.\n[221] Le Dr Chopra a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas trouv\u00e9 satisfaisante la r\u00e9ponse du Dr Paterson. Il a aussi affirm\u00e9 qu'il avait eu le sentiment que le Dr Paterson prenait le parti du Dr Lachance et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s contrari\u00e9 par la mani\u00e8re dont l'affaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e, car selon lui cela montrait qu'il existait encore une mentalit\u00e9 raciste \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[222] Dans une note envoy\u00e9e au Dr Paterson, le Dr Lachance a expliqu\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance la note adress\u00e9e au Dr Lachance par le Dr Chopra, que ce qu'il avait voulu faire, lors de la r\u00e9union en question, c'\u00e9tait \u00e9tablir imm\u00e9diatement une bonne relation avec le plus d'employ\u00e9s possible du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, que, dans son poste ant\u00e9rieur, nombre de ses subalternes \u00e9taient membres de minorit\u00e9s visibles et que le contexte de la r\u00e9union du 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998 l'avait conduit \u00e0 dire au personnel que son auditoire ressemblait \u00e0 son ancien groupe d'employ\u00e9s, o\u00f9 les minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e9taient largement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, et que cette situation lui plaisait particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 lui. Finalement, le Dr Lachance \u00e9crivait que, contrairement \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration sans indulgence formul\u00e9e par le Dr Chopra le 10 f\u00e9vrier 1998 \u00e0 propos de l'intention qu'il avait pu avoir cet apr\u00e8s-midi-l\u00e0, ses commentaires attestaient un niveau \u00e9lev\u00e9 de sensibilit\u00e9 culturelle envers les minorit\u00e9s visibles du Bureau.\n[223] Au cours de l'audience, le Tribunal a entendu le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tang, conseill\u00e8re en ressources humaines \u00e0 la Section des services \u00e0 la haute direction, \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada. Mme Tang a parl\u00e9 de la formation que le Dr Lachance avait re\u00e7ue \u00e0 propos de la diversit\u00e9 en milieu de travail, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union du 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998. Mme Tang a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le Dr Lachance avait particip\u00e9 le 8 d\u00e9cembre 1998 \u00e0 un atelier appel\u00e9 Entrevues de s\u00e9lection impartiale fond\u00e9e sur les comp\u00e9tences, puis, le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1998, \u00e0 un autre cours de formation intitul\u00e9 Construire des \u00e9quipes de travail diversifi\u00e9es. Selon la preuve, Mme Tang ignorait le contenu ou la substance de ces cours et elle n'a pu confirmer si le Dr Lachance avait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l'un ou l'autre des cours auxquels il s'\u00e9tait inscrit.\n[224] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'affaire Lachance a abouti devant le Comit\u00e9 s\u00e9natorial permanent des privil\u00e8ges, du R\u00e8glement et de la proc\u00e9dure, o\u00f9 M. David Dodge, alors sous-ministre \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, a comparu comme t\u00e9moin et a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 propos des commentaires du Dr Lachance. Le dossier montre que M. David Dodge, qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 devant le Comit\u00e9 s\u00e9natorial, le 29 f\u00e9vrier 2000, au sujet des propos tenus par le Dr Lachance selon lesquels [traduction] il aimait bien les minorit\u00e9s visibles ou selon lesquels [traduction] tout cela est impr\u00e9gn\u00e9 d'une mentalit\u00e9 ax\u00e9e sur les minorit\u00e9s visibles, que le Dr Lachance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que, quelles que f\u00fbt son intention, il s'agissait l\u00e0 de propos inopportuns. Le Tribunal n'a aucune raison de croire que la transcription de la r\u00e9union du Comit\u00e9 s\u00e9natorial qui se rapportent au t\u00e9moignage de M. Dodge ne sont pas exactes.\n[225] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Dodge et le Dr Paterson n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, le Tribunal doit s'en remettre \u00e0 sa propre interpr\u00e9tation des vues qu'ils ont exprim\u00e9es \u00e0 propos des commentaires formul\u00e9s par le Dr Lachance lors de la r\u00e9union du 9 f\u00e9vrier 1999. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le Dr Lachance n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, le Tribunal est d'avis que l'intim\u00e9 aurait pu, outre les documents produits comme preuve, appeler le Dr Paterson \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner pour qu'il explique comment le minist\u00e8re avait donn\u00e9 suite aux commentaires du Dr Lachance. Il en va de m\u00eame pour M. Dodge.\n[226] Dans ses observations orales, l'avocat du plaignant a fait valoir que les propos tenus par le Dr Lachance lors de la r\u00e9union du 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998 \u00e9taient plus qu'imprudents ou d\u00e9plac\u00e9s; c'\u00e9taient des propos tout \u00e0 fait racistes et offensants et il n'importe pas que certaines personnes ne s'en soient pas offusqu\u00e9es. Pour l'avocat du plaignant, ce sont des propos qui non seulement sont discriminatoires, mais constituent du harc\u00e8lement.\n[227] Pour sa part, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que le Tribunal ne peut d\u00e9duire des propos du Dr Lachance que celui-ci \u00e9tait raciste et que, par cons\u00e9quent, toutes ses d\u00e9cisions futures prises dans le cadre de son poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires devraient \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es de discriminatoires ou racistes. Pour l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9, le Dr Chopra a jug\u00e9 hors contexte les commentaires du Dr Lachance. S'agissant de savoir si les commentaires en question constituent du harc\u00e8lement, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir qu'ils ne correspondent pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de ce qui constitue du harc\u00e8lement en droit. Une remarque unique ne satisfait pas au crit\u00e8re applicable au harc\u00e8lement.\n[228] Le Tribunal juge que les commentaires formul\u00e9s par le Dr Lachance lors de la r\u00e9union du 6 f\u00e9vrier 1998 \u00e9taient offensants pour le Dr Chopra et qu'ils \u00e9taient, quelle que soit la norme appliqu\u00e9e, de caract\u00e8re raciste, m\u00eame si certaines personnes qui se trouvaient l\u00e0 ne les ont pas jug\u00e9s ainsi. M\u00eame si le Dr Lachance a pu les formuler dans le dessein, pour ainsi dire, de rompre la glace avec ses nouveaux coll\u00e8gues ou m\u00eame s'ils pouvaient passer pour une marque d'amiti\u00e9 envers le groupe, ils attestent n\u00e9anmoins un manque de sensibilit\u00e9 de la part du Dr Lachance envers les gens dont la peau n'est pas blanche et qui sont vus comme diff\u00e9rents des personnes de race blanche. Le Dr Lachance ne voulait peut-\u00eatre pas faire montre de discrimination envers les minorit\u00e9s visibles. N\u00e9anmoins, la jurisprudence est claire : l'intention d'une personne est sans rapport avec la question de savoir si elle a fait preuve ou non de discrimination envers quelqu'un d'autre (Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission) v. Play it Again Sports Ltd, [2004] N.S.J. No. 403, paragraphe 36).\n[229] Le Tribunal estime donc que le Dr Chopra non seulement a prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination au regard des propos tenus par le Dr Lachance lors de la r\u00e9union du 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998, mais encore il a apport\u00e9 une preuve convaincante que le Dr Lachance a exerc\u00e9 contre lui de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa race ou son origine ethnique, en violation de l'article 7 de la Loi. Comme il est \u00e9crit plus haut, l'intention d'exercer ou non de la discrimination est sans rapport avec la preuve de discrimination. Le crit\u00e8re est, d'abord et avant tout, le caract\u00e8re raciste des propos en tant que tels, que la personne all\u00e9guant la discrimination ait \u00e9t\u00e9 offens\u00e9e ou non par les propos (Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission) v. Play it Again Sports Ltd, [2004] N.S.J. No. 403).\n[230] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments que le Tribunal juge concluants au regard de la preuve prima facie sont le pass\u00e9 r\u00e9cent de discrimination \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, le caract\u00e8re intrins\u00e8quement raciste des propos tenus - les Blancs par opposition aux non-Blancs, le fait que le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 offens\u00e9 par les propos et l'a fait savoir au directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le manque de sensibilit\u00e9 du Dr Lachance et du Dr Paterson en r\u00e9ponse aux inqui\u00e9tudes du Dr Chopra, enfin le fait que le Dr Lachance a re\u00e7u, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union de f\u00e9vrier 1998, une formation sur la diversit\u00e9 en milieu de travail. L'intim\u00e9 avait donc la charge de prouver que les propos du Dr Lachance n'\u00e9taient d'aucune fa\u00e7on discriminatoires. Le Tribunal croit que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas apport\u00e9 cette preuve.\n[231] Le Tribunal estime \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que les lettres \u00e9chang\u00e9es entre le Dr Paterson et le Dr Lachance, ainsi qu'entre le Dr Paterson et le Dr Chopra, visent davantage \u00e0 justifier ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit, qu'\u00e0 admettre que les propos ont pu \u00eatre offensants et discriminatoires. Le Dr Lachance et le Dr Paterson n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et n'ont donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'\u00e9clairer davantage le Tribunal sur les propos qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenus lors de la r\u00e9union du 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998. Le Tribunal croit que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas donn\u00e9 d'explication cr\u00e9dible de la nature v\u00e9ritable des propos tenus par le Dr Lachance, et, comme ils n'ont pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9, il ne croit pas que leurs explications \u00e9crites sont convaincantes.\n[232] Ici encore, le Tribunal ne perd pas de vue que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du Dr Chopra est sujette \u00e0 caution. Cela dit, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le clairement que, le lendemain du jour o\u00f9 le Dr Lachance a tenu ses propos, le Dr Chopra a fait savoir au directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu'il s'\u00e9tait senti bless\u00e9 par les propos en cause. Le Tribunal ne voit aucune raison de penser que la contrari\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9prouv\u00e9e par le Dr Chopra \u00e0 la suite des propos tenus par le Dr Lachance n'\u00e9tait pas authentique et qu'elle \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par le d\u00e9sir d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le Dr Lachance.\n[233] Le Tribunal croit cependant que, vu le contexte dans lequel le Dr Lachance s'\u00e9tait exprim\u00e9, ses propos, bien que d\u00e9plac\u00e9s et racistes, ne constituent pas du harc\u00e8lement, parce qu'ils ne r\u00e9pondent pas aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Marinaki et Bobb. Le Tribunal est d'avis que les propos tenus lors de la r\u00e9union du 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998 constituent un incident isol\u00e9. Il n'y a ici ni persistance ni r\u00e9p\u00e9tition et nous n'avons pas affaire \u00e0 un comportement syst\u00e9matique. Le Tribunal rel\u00e8ve qu'aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite montrant que le Dr Lachance a tenu les m\u00eames propos \u00e0 une autre occasion.\n[234] Cela dit, le Tribunal est d'avis que, compte tenu du pass\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 Canada, un pass\u00e9 marqu\u00e9 par la discrimination et une m\u00e9connaissance de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 raciale, et vu la d\u00e9cision ACNRI en particulier et les conclusions qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9es, le minist\u00e8re aurait d\u00fb agir plus \u00e9nergiquement et aurait d\u00fb faire savoir publiquement qu'il n'approuvait pas la conduite du Dr Lachance, et qu'il ne tol\u00e9rerait pas de commentaires de cette nature au sein du minist\u00e8re.\n[235] Le Tribunal juge que le Dr Paterson a trait\u00e9 avec peu d'\u00e9gards la plainte du Dr Chopra. Sa premi\u00e8re r\u00e9action a \u00e9t\u00e9 de jeter le doute sur le souvenir qu'avait le Dr Chopra de l'incident, plut\u00f4t que de prendre l'incident au s\u00e9rieux et de demander un compl\u00e9ment d'enqu\u00eate. Le Dr Paterson aurait d\u00fb voir dans la note de service du Dr Chopra un sujet de pr\u00e9occupation, compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision ACNRI. Le Tribunal est d'avis que l'affaire Lachance n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre ainsi mont\u00e9e en \u00e9pingle et que, si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9r\u00e9e convenablement, elle aurait conduit \u00e0 un mot d'excuse du Dr Lachance ou, du moins, \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration de sa part selon laquelle, s'il avait offens\u00e9 quelqu'un par ses propos, alors il le regrettait et lui pr\u00e9sentait ses excuses. Il semble que des excuses n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es.\nb) La suspension de cinq jours [236] L'avocat du plaignant a fait valoir que la suspension de cinq jours impos\u00e9e au Dr Chopra par le Dr Lachance \u00e9tait une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 l'encontre du Dr Chopra, qui n'avait pas m\u00e2ch\u00e9 ses mots sur l'existence de pratiques racistes au sein de la fonction publique, en particulier \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, et que ladite suspension \u00e9tait \u00e9galement discriminatoire.\n[237] Pour sa part, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la suspension de cinq jours lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e, le Dr Chopra ne l'avait pas qualifi\u00e9e d'acte discriminatoire, mais de mesure de repr\u00e9sailles. \u00c0 son avis, il n'y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de discrimination ou de repr\u00e9sailles dans la d\u00e9cision de suspendre le Dr Chopra. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a admis cependant que Sant\u00e9 Canada avait eu tort de consid\u00e9rer l'acte du Dr Chopra comme un manquement \u00e0 son obligation de loyaut\u00e9 envers son employeur, compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision rendue le 12 mars 2001 par la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique.\n[238] Le Tribunal ne peut ignorer le fait que celui qui a suspendu le Dr Chopra \u00e9tait le Dr Lachance et que la suspension a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e apr\u00e8s que le Dr Chopra eut sign\u00e9 une p\u00e9tition o\u00f9 \u00e9tait contest\u00e9e la nomination du Dr Lachance, en f\u00e9vrier 1998, au poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires et apr\u00e8s que le Dr Chopra se fut plaint par \u00e9crit au directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des propos tenus par le Dr Lachance lors de sa premi\u00e8re rencontre avec le personnel du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998, ainsi qu'apr\u00e8s que le Dr Chopra eut ajout\u00e9 le 27 juin 1999 d'autres all\u00e9gations \u00e0 sa plainte initiale, all\u00e9gations qui faisaient explicitement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la conduite discriminatoire du Dr Lachance.\n[239] Le Tribunal ne peut ignorer non plus que, \u00e0 la suite des propos que le Dr Lachance a tenus lors de la r\u00e9union du 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998, celui-ci, dans une note envoy\u00e9e au Dr Paterson, a rendu la pareille au Dr Chopra en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation faite par celui-ci dans sa note du 10 f\u00e9vrier 1998 adress\u00e9e au Dr Paterson. Dans sa note au Dr Paterson, le Dr Chopra \u00e9voque le fait que le Dr Lachance avait fait une remarque d\u00e9sobligeante \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des minorit\u00e9s visibles. La preuve montre que, dans sa propre note au Dr Paterson, le Dr Lachance \u00e9voque l'affirmation d\u00e9sobligeante faite par le Dr Chopra le 10 f\u00e9vrier 1998 concernant ses motivations cet apr\u00e8s-midi-l\u00e0. Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re la r\u00e9ponse du Dr Lachance comme le signe sans \u00e9quivoque qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 tenir t\u00eate au Dr Chopra et que la table \u00e9tait mise pour de futures hostilit\u00e9s.\n[240] Le Tribunal estime que ces divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments, outre le fait que le Dr Lachance aurait pu r\u00e9agir diff\u00e9remment \u00e0 la situation, comme l'a dit l'avocat du plaignant, et qu'il semblait persuad\u00e9 qu'aucune discrimination ne r\u00e9gnait \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, suffisent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles, mais ne suffisent pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Par ailleurs, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que le Dr Lachance devait avoir eu vent de l'existence de la plainte du Dr Chopra et des all\u00e9gations additionnelles faites contre lui en juin 1999.\n[241] Le Tribunal est conscient cependant que, dans sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 11 ao\u00fbt 1999, le Dr Lachance \u00e9crit, \u00e0 propos de la conf\u00e9rence de Patrimoine Canada, qu'il consid\u00e8re que le Dr Chopra a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de loyaut\u00e9 envers le minist\u00e8re et que son inconduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e est totalement inacceptable pour le minist\u00e8re, et qu'il a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de suspendre le Dr Chopra pour une p\u00e9riode de cinq jours ouvrables.\n[242] Selon le dossier, l'intim\u00e9 a choisi de ne pas faire t\u00e9moigner le Dr Lachance. Comme on l'a vu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, hormis les \u00e9changes qui ont eu lieu entre les parties et l'information qu'elles ont communiqu\u00e9e au Tribunal, le Tribunal n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement inform\u00e9 des raisons pour lesquelles le Dr Lachance n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Le Tribunal devrait-il donc, sans entendre le Dr Lachance ou quelqu'un d'autre de Sant\u00e9 Canada, s'en remettre uniquement \u00e0 la lettre adress\u00e9e par le Dr Lachance au Dr Chopra le 11 ao\u00fbt 1999, et d\u00e9duire que l'unique raison qui a conduit le Dr Lachance \u00e0 imposer au Dr Chopra une suspension de cinq jours \u00e9tait l'inconduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e du Dr Chopra, et devrait-il conclure, vu le contexte dans lequel la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise, que les repr\u00e9sailles n'avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec sa d\u00e9cision?\n[243] Comme on le sait, la discrimination ainsi que les repr\u00e9sailles, souvent, n'apparaissent pas d'embl\u00e9e. C'est souvent par l'interrogatoire direct d'un t\u00e9moin que la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 se fait jour. Sur ce point, il convient de citer l'ouvrage de Sopinka et al., The Law of Evidence in Canada, 1999, au paragraphe 6.321, o\u00f9 les auteurs \u00e9crivent ce qui suit : [traduction] Dans le m\u00eame esprit, une conclusion d\u00e9favorable peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e \u00e0 l'encontre d'une partie qui, sans se justifier, n'assigne pas un t\u00e9moin important sur lequel elle exerce un contr\u00f4le exclusif. Cela \u00e9quivaut en effet \u00e0 un aveu implicite que la d\u00e9position du t\u00e9moin absent serait contraire aux arguments de la partie concern\u00e9e, ou du moins ne les appuierait pas.\n[244] Le Tribunal estime que l'intim\u00e9, en n'assignant pas les t\u00e9moins concern\u00e9s, n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 prouver que l'esprit de vengeance n'\u00e9tait pas l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont conduit le Dr Lachance \u00e0 imposer au Dr Chopra une suspension de cinq jours, vu les circonstances entourant l'imposition de la suspension. Le Tribunal estime donc que, vu le contexte, les repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9taient, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, l'une des raisons ayant men\u00e9 le Dr Lachance \u00e0 imposer au Dr Chopra une suspension de cinq jours, le 11 ao\u00fbt 1999, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 14.1 de la Loi.\nc) La plainte Zohair [245] Dans ses observations soumises au Tribunal, l'avocat du plaignant affirmait que la mani\u00e8re dont Sant\u00e9 Canada avait trait\u00e9 la plainte Zohair, ainsi que l'incident de la conf\u00e9rence de Patrimoine Canada, atteste le harc\u00e8lement exerc\u00e9 par Sant\u00e9 Canada envers le Dr Chopra. L'avocat du plaignant a soulign\u00e9 le fait que, alors que Sant\u00e9 Canada \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 agir promptement contre le plaignant, le minist\u00e8re agissait moins promptement contre d'autres employ\u00e9s de Sant\u00e9 Canada dont la conduite, aux yeux du Dr Chopra, \u00e9tait condamnable.\n[246] Le Tribunal ne voit pas, dans la mani\u00e8re dont Sant\u00e9 Canada a trait\u00e9 la plainte Zohair, une preuve de harc\u00e8lement de la part de Sant\u00e9 Canada. Le Tribunal croit que le plaignant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 que cet incident r\u00e9pond au crit\u00e8re juridique permettant de conclure au harc\u00e8lement selon l'article 10 de la Loi. Par ailleurs, le Tribunal ne voit pas en quoi la mani\u00e8re dont Sant\u00e9 Canada a trait\u00e9 la plainte Zohair peut \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles de la part de Sant\u00e9 Canada au motif que le Dr Chopra avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de violation des droits de la personne. La preuve sur ce point est tout simplement inexistante.\nd) La plainte Elanco [247] Le Tribunal estime que le Dr Chopra n'a produit en preuve aucun fait important \u00e9tablissant que la mani\u00e8re dont le minist\u00e8re a donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la plainte Elanco \u00e9tait discriminatoire et \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par l'origine ethnique du Dr Chopra. Le Tribunal estime donc que le plaignant n'a pas ici prouv\u00e9 prima facie la discrimination au regard de la plainte Elanco. De simples all\u00e9gations de discrimination, sans plus, ne constituent pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[248] Cela dit, puisque l'incident Elanco s'est produit en 1997, avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l'article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l'action ou l'inaction de Sant\u00e9 Canada au regard de cet incident ne saurait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles selon la Loi.\ne) L'exclusion du Dr Chopra du projet Flumequine [249] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son exclusion du projet Flumequine en 1993 ne constituait pas une discrimination directe, mais une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son encontre parce qu'il avait soulev\u00e9, au sein du Bureau, des questions touchant les droits de la personne.\n[250] Vu que le projet Flumequine a eu lieu en 1993, bien avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l'article 14.1 de la Loi, le Tribunal juge que le plaignant n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la condition juridique qui permettrait au Tribunal de dire qu'il y a eu repr\u00e9sailles en raison d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant.\n(iii) La question de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique [251] Dans son formulaire de plainte dat\u00e9 du 12 janvier 1999, le plaignant \u00e9crit qu'aucun de ses coll\u00e8gues de race blanche n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 et que, s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente, c'est \u00e0 cause de sa race, de sa couleur et de son origine nationale ou ethnique. Le plaignant \u00e9crit aussi que, pour pourvoir les postes de direction, Sant\u00e9 Canada trouve toujours le moyen de ne pas recourir \u00e0 des candidats qualifi\u00e9s qui sont membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles et que le minist\u00e8re a pour habitude de recruter les EX \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur m\u00eame de Sant\u00e9 Canada, sauf si des candidats qualifi\u00e9s membres de minorit\u00e9s visibles sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9s par ces postes, auquel cas le minist\u00e8re proc\u00e8de \u00e0 un recrutement externe.\n[252] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant \u00e9crit aussi que, s'il jamais eu de promotion \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, c'est en partie \u00e0 cause de l'existence d'une discrimination raciale syst\u00e9mique exerc\u00e9e par la haute direction de Sant\u00e9 Canada \u00e0 l'encontre des minorit\u00e9s visibles et il nomme ensuite les cadres sup\u00e9rieurs qui, selon lui, pratiquent une discrimination raciale syst\u00e9mique.\n[253] Le plaignant \u00e9crit aussi, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, que le minist\u00e8re ne lui a pas procur\u00e9 la formation n\u00e9cessaire ni les autres moyens de perfectionner ses aptitudes et ses comp\u00e9tences. D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, affirme-t-il, Sant\u00e9 Canada trouve toujours le moyen d'\u00e9viter que des candidats appartenant aux minorit\u00e9s visibles acc\u00e8dent \u00e0 des postes de direction. Finalement, le plaignant soutient que ces pratiques attestent l'existence d'une discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, en violation de l'article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[254] Les all\u00e9gations du plaignant concernant l'existence de discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada durant la p\u00e9riode allant de 1993 \u00e0 1999 ont une vaste port\u00e9e. Comme je l'\u00e9crivais plus haut, celui qui all\u00e8gue une chose doit la prouver, et il ne suffit pas d'all\u00e9guer simplement l'existence de discrimination sans en apporter la preuve, ni d'avoir la ferme conviction que la discrimination r\u00e8gne \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[255] La discrimination syst\u00e9mique en milieu de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie ainsi dans l'arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, aux pages 1139 et 1143 : discrimination qui r\u00e9sulte de la simple application de proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tablies de recrutement, d'embauchage et de promotion, dont aucune n'est n\u00e9cessairement con\u00e7ue pour promouvoir la discrimination. La discrimination syst\u00e9mique est souvent involontaire. Elle r\u00e9sulte de l'application de pratiques et politiques \u00e9tablies qui ont une incidence n\u00e9gative sur l'embauchage et les perspectives d'avancement d'un groupe donn\u00e9. Elle est accentu\u00e9e par les attitudes des gestionnaires et des coll\u00e8gues qui acceptent des visions st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9es conduisant \u00e0 la ferme conviction que les membres du groupe concern\u00e9 sont incapables d'accomplir telle ou telle t\u00e2che, m\u00eame si cette conclusion est objectivement fausse. La Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9crivait en outre que, pour combattre la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, il est essentiel d'instaurer un climat dans lequel les pratiques et attitudes n\u00e9gatives puissent \u00eatre combattues et d\u00e9courag\u00e9es.\n[256] Le Tribunal est conscient que, par le pass\u00e9, Sant\u00e9 Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la tra\u00eene s'agissant de la nomination de membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e0 des postes de direction. Les conclusions tir\u00e9es par le Tribunal dans l'affaire ACNRI, ainsi que sa d\u00e9cision dans cette affaire, montrent clairement que Sant\u00e9 Canada ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux conditions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne au regard des perspectives d'emploi offertes aux minorit\u00e9s visibles.\n[257] Le Tribunal ne peut non plus laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le fait que, par le pass\u00e9, le Dr Chopra a connu nombre de difficult\u00e9s au sein du minist\u00e8re : une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui sans qu'il soit inform\u00e9 de son existence (Drennan), une note r\u00e9dig\u00e9e \u00e0 son sujet sans qu'il soit inform\u00e9 de sa teneur (Cuddihy), son exclusion de projets auxquels ses coll\u00e8gues \u00e9taient invit\u00e9s \u00e0 prendre part, et cela sans qu'on lui donne aucune explication (projet Flumequine), la suspension de cinq jours qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par le Dr Lachance (conf\u00e9rence de Patrimoine Canada), la r\u00e9primande qu'il a re\u00e7ue du Dr Le Magueur (plainte Zohair). En outre, le dossier montre que le Dr Chopra a vu de nombreuses nominations et postes int\u00e9rimaires lui \u00e9chapper : la nomination du Dr Scott (1993-1995), la nomination du Dr Lachance (1998), la nomination du Dr Alexander (1999), la nomination du Dr Butler (1999), toutes des nominations qui selon lui \u00e9taient entach\u00e9es de discrimination. Tous ces incidents ont pes\u00e9 sur le Dr Chopra, qui en est venu \u00e0 penser que la discrimination r\u00e9gnait au sein de Sant\u00e9 Canada. Tous ces incidents qui ont concern\u00e9 une seule personne permettent-ils au Tribunal de conclure qu'il y avait, \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, durant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte (1993-1999), une forme de discrimination syst\u00e9mique qui impr\u00e9gnait toute l'organisation?\n[258] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, en septembre 2002, la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans pr\u00e9vue pour l'application de l'ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dans l'affaire ACNRI \u00e9tait achev\u00e9e et que, par lettre dat\u00e9e du 13 mai 2003, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e9crivait que Sant\u00e9 Canada s'\u00e9tait pleinement conform\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les mesures \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l'ordonnance du Tribunal. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Commission \u00e9crivait, dans sa lettre au sous-ministre de Sant\u00e9 Canada, que l'analyse faite par la Commission montrait que, durant la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans, la repr\u00e9sentation des minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada avait nettement augment\u00e9 dans les cat\u00e9gories et aux niveaux int\u00e9ressant l'ordonnance du Tribunal. La Commission ajoutait que le net progr\u00e8s constat\u00e9 n'aurait pas pu \u00eatre accompli sans l'engagement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de Sant\u00e9 Canada. La lettre mentionnait \u00e9galement que, d'apr\u00e8s les donn\u00e9es sur le recrutement dans l'\u00e9chelon administratif sup\u00e9rieur EX et dans les groupes de rel\u00e8ve pour cet \u00e9chelon, les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles recevaient une part \u00e9quitable de telles nominations, et recevaient \u00e9galement, pour les niveaux indiqu\u00e9s dans l'ordonnance du Tribunal, une part des postes int\u00e9rimaires qui \u00e9tait conforme aux attentes. Dans sa lettre, la pr\u00e9sidente de la Commission reconna\u00eet que Sant\u00e9 Canada se conforme aujourd'hui pleinement \u00e0 toutes les mesures indiqu\u00e9es dans l'ordonnance du Tribunal dans l'affaire ACNRI.\n[259] Le Tribunal ne peut laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ces faits et constatations. Il convient de noter ici que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par l'ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal dans l'affaire ACNRI va de 1997 \u00e0 2002 et englobe certaines des all\u00e9gations de discrimination qui sont faites par le plaignant.\n[260] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a contest\u00e9 que Sant\u00e9 Canada se conformait pleinement \u00e0 toutes les mesures indiqu\u00e9es dans l'ordonnance accompagnant la d\u00e9cision ACNRI. Comme je l'\u00e9crivais plus haut, le plaignant a droit \u00e0 ses opinions. Cela dit, des all\u00e9gations, si fermes soient-elles, qui pr\u00e9tendent contredire des faits av\u00e9r\u00e9s et non contest\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9es.\n[261] Le Tribunal croit que le plaignant n'a pas, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, \u00e9tabli que Sant\u00e9 Canada n'est pas venu \u00e0 bout de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique apr\u00e8s l'ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal dans l'affaire ACNRI, ni \u00e9tabli que la discrimination syst\u00e9mique existait encore \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada durant la p\u00e9riode allant de 1997 \u00e0 2002.\n[262] Puisque le plaignant n'a pas apport\u00e9 de preuve contredisant les constatations de la Commission, le Tribunal n'a aucune raison de conclure que la discrimination syst\u00e9mique existe encore \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada, ni d'ordonner \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada de prendre d'autres mesures pour r\u00e9gler des questions de discrimination g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ou syst\u00e9mique.\n[263] Cela dit, il ne s'ensuit pas que la discrimination n'a pas exist\u00e9 ou n'aurait pu exister dans un pass\u00e9 r\u00e9cent au sein de Sant\u00e9 Canada, ni que des personnes au sein du minist\u00e8re n'ont pu agir, \u00e0 l'occasion, comme l'indique le dossier, d'une mani\u00e8re discriminatoire. Des incidents pass\u00e9s de discrimination peuvent, avec raison, donner \u00e0 penser que la discrimination existe encore dans le milieu de travail. Cependant, ils ne prouvent pas en tant que tels l'existence de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Un ou plusieurs constats de discrimination ne suffisent pas en soi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l'existence d'une discrimination syst\u00e9mique au sein d'une organisation telle que Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[264] Le plaignant affirme que tous les gestionnaires \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada exercent une discrimination raciale syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l'encontre des membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles et que toutes les nominations faites au sein du minist\u00e8re au cours des 20 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoires. Le Tribunal ne peut non plus ignorer le fait que ces all\u00e9gations du plaignant demeurent non \u00e9tay\u00e9es tant que des faits concrets ne sont pas port\u00e9s \u00e0 son attention. Des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations h\u00e2tives comme celles qu'a faites le plaignant, sans en apporter la preuve, nuisent en d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sur la question de savoir si Sant\u00e9 Canada s'est ou non conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ordonnance rendue dans l'affaire ACNRI, et elles se r\u00e9percutent d\u00e9favorablement sur la promotion des droits de la personne.\n[265] Le Tribunal estime donc que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, que Sant\u00e9 Canada a contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 10 de la Loi.\nIV. R\u00c9PARATIONS [266] Le Tribunal croit que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le Dr Chopra est \u00e9tay\u00e9e sous trois aspects :\nles propos tenus par le Dr Lachance le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1998 \u00e9taient des propos discriminatoires \u00e0 l'endroit du Dr Chopra ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'endroit des personnes qui travaillaient \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque au sein du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires et qui n'\u00e9taient pas de race blanche, et les propos en question \u00e9taient contraires \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi; la suspension de cinq jours impos\u00e9e le 11 ao\u00fbt 1999 au Dr Chopra par le Dr Lachance \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat d'une forme de repr\u00e9sailles contre le Dr Chopra parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de violation des droits de la personne, et ladite suspension \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 l'article 14.1 de la Loi; le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'une discrimination parce qu'on ne lui a pas offert en septembre 1999 le poste int\u00e9rimaire de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, ce qui contrevenait \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi.\n[267] L'avocat du plaignant a demand\u00e9, dans ses observations orales, que le Dr Chopra soit d\u00e9dommag\u00e9 pour les atteintes morales li\u00e9es \u00e0 la discrimination et aux repr\u00e9sailles dont il a pu \u00eatre la victime. Vu les conclusions tir\u00e9es par le Tribunal au regard des incidents que le Tribunal a assimil\u00e9s \u00e0 de la discrimination et \u00e0 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles, le Tribunal est d'avis qu'une somme de 4 000 $ pour les atteintes morales est une somme raisonnable. Le Tribunal est conscient que deux des trois incidents qu'il a assimil\u00e9s \u00e0 de la discrimination ou \u00e0 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles se sont produits apr\u00e8s le 30 juin 1998, date \u00e0 laquelle le plafond de l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral a \u00e9t\u00e9 hauss\u00e9 \u00e0 20 000 $.\n[268] Dans ses observations finales, l'avocat du plaignant a demand\u00e9 que le plaignant soit indemnis\u00e9 pour tout manque \u00e0 gagner li\u00e9 \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire. Vu que le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que le Dr Chopra avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'une discrimination en 1999 pour le poste int\u00e9rimaire de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains, le Dr Chopra a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 correspondant \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre ce qu'il aurait gagn\u00e9 comme chef int\u00e9rimaire et ce qu'il aurait gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque comme \u00e9valuateur.\n[269] Les parties ont indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu'elles \u00e9tabliraient entre elles la somme li\u00e9e au manque \u00e0 gagner. Le Tribunal demeure cependant saisi de la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats si les parties ne parviennent pas \u00e0 s'entendre.\nV. ORDONNANCE [270] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, le Tribunal d\u00e9clare que l'intim\u00e9 a port\u00e9 atteinte aux droits du plaignant prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les articles 7 et 14.1 de la Loi, et il ordonne ce qui suit :\nle plaignant a droit \u00e0 la somme de 4 000 $ pour atteintes morales; le plaignant a droit, au titre du manque \u00e0 gagner, \u00e0 une somme correspondant \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre ce qu'il aurait gagn\u00e9 s'il avait occup\u00e9 le poste de chef de la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains durant une p\u00e9riode de quatre mois en septembre 1999 et ce qu'il aurait gagn\u00e9 comme \u00e9valuateur; le plaignant a droit aux int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les sommes susmentionn\u00e9es, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (ONTARIO)\nle 12 septembre 2008\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT901\/2104\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nShiv Chopra c.

Hadjis\n[1] Dans un jugement dat\u00e9 du 16 octobre 2007, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision que j'ai rendue en l'esp\u00e8ce et a renvoy\u00e9 l'affaire au Tribunal pour nouvel examen (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Buffett, 2007 CF 1061). L'ordonnance de la Cour pr\u00e9cise qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour le Tribunal de tenir une autre audience et que la d\u00e9cision relativement \u00e0 la plainte de M. Buffett doit \u00eatre prise [traduction] conform\u00e9ment aux motifs de la Cour, en particulier les paragraphes 55, 56 et suivants .\n[2] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans le jugement que, s'il s'\u00e9tait agi d'un appel de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal plut\u00f4t que d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait ordonn\u00e9 aux Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (FAC) de financer le volet injection intracytoplasmique de spermatozo\u00efdes (IICS) de M. Buffett jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de trois cycles. La Cour a cependant not\u00e9 que, lors de l'audition du contr\u00f4le judiciaire, M. Buffett a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, compte tenu de son \u00e2ge et de celui de son \u00e9pouse, la f\u00e9condation in vitro (FIV) et l'IICS n'\u00e9taient plus des traitements recommand\u00e9s. En cons\u00e9quence, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que rendre une ordonnance en ce sens serait maintenant th\u00e9orique . Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision ne comporte pas de telle ordonnance.\n[3] En outre, les parties ont confirm\u00e9 au Tribunal que les FAC avaient pay\u00e9 int\u00e9gralement l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral que j'avais accord\u00e9e dans ma d\u00e9cision du 15 septembre 2006, laquelle indemnit\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans son jugement du 16 octobre 2007. Je ne crois donc pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire que je rende \u00e0 nouveau cette ordonnance.\n[4] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour les motifs expos\u00e9s par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, je prononce l'ordonnance suivante :\nEn vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, j'ordonne aux Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 ses objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures pour modifier sa ligne de conduite de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que ses membres de sexe masculin re\u00e7oivent du financement pour le volet injection intracytoplasmique de spermatozo\u00efdes (IICS) de leurs traitements contre l'infertilit\u00e9 tant que les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes continueront de financer les traitements de f\u00e9condation in vitro (FIV) de ses membres de sexe f\u00e9minin.\nAthanasios D.

Richard Warman, le plaignant, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre Mme Melissa Guille. Il all\u00e8gue dans sa plainte que, le 21 juillet 2002 et par la suite, celle-ci a commis un acte discriminatoire contre des personnes ou des groupes de personnes en raison de leur orientation sexuelle, de leur race, de leur religion, de leur couleur et de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, en utilisant un site Web sur Internet de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e pour aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les homosexuels et les lesbiennes, les Juifs, les Musulmans, les Autochtones, les Noirs, les Arabes, d'autres personnes non-blanches et les Roms (aussi appel\u00e9s Gitans), ce qui contrevient au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] La plainte comporte huit \u00e9chantillons repr\u00e9sentatifs, selon le plaignant, de textes discriminatoires affich\u00e9s sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance (CHA). Le plaignant conclut \u00e0 partir de ces exemples que Mme Melissa Guille a commis un acte discriminatoire contre des personnes ou des groupes de personnes en raison de leur orientation sexuelle, de leur race, de leur religion, de leur couleur et de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, en utilisant un site Web sur Internet de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e pour aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les homosexuels et les lesbiennes, les Juifs, les Musulmans, les Autochtones, les Noirs, les Arabes, d'autres personnes non-blanches et les Roms (aussi appel\u00e9s Gitans), ce qui contrevient au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[3] Le 11 ao\u00fbt 2004, M. Richard Warman, le plaignant, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte distincte contre la Canadian Heritage Alliance. Il all\u00e8gue dans sa plainte que, le 21 juillet 2002 et par la suite, celle-ci a commis un acte discriminatoire contre des personnes ou des groupes de personnes en raison de leur orientation sexuelle, de leur race, de leur religion, de leur couleur et de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, en utilisant un site Web sur Internet de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e pour aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les homosexuels et les lesbiennes, les Juifs, les Musulmans, les Autochtones, les Noirs, les Arabes, d'autres personnes non-blanches et les Roms (aussi appel\u00e9s Gitans), ce qui contrevient au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[4] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les similitudes entre les deux plaintes, le Tribunal les examinera ensemble.\n[5] La Commission a pleinement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience concernant la plainte et \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une avocate. Le plaignant, qui est avocat, s'est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame. En ce qui concerne les intim\u00e9es, elles \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par deux mandataires, d\u00fbment reconnus comme tels par le Tribunal. Le Tribunal a entendu deux t\u00e9moins : M. Warman et Mme Guille.\nII. LES DISPOSITIONS PERTINENTES DE LA LOI CANADIENNE SUR LES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE [6] L'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, qui porte sur la propagande haineuse, pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, d'utiliser ou de faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement pour aborder ou faire aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3. Il demeure entendu que le paragraphe (1) s'applique \u00e0 l'utilisation d'un ordinateur, d'un ensemble d'ordinateurs connect\u00e9s ou reli\u00e9s les uns aux autres, notamment d'Internet, ou de tout autre moyen de communication semblable mais qu'il ne s'applique pas dans les cas o\u00f9 les services d'une entreprise de radiodiffusion sont utilis\u00e9s. Pour l'application du pr\u00e9sent article, le propri\u00e9taire ou exploitant d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication ne commet pas un acte discriminatoire du seul fait que des tiers ont utilis\u00e9 ses installations pour aborder des questions vis\u00e9es au paragraphe (1).\n[7] L'article 3 de la Loi d\u00e9finit les motifs de distinction illicite. Il est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\nPour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience. Une distinction fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse ou l'accouchement est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\nIII. LES QUESTIONS PR\u00c9LIMINAIRES [8] Avant d'analyser les questions de fond soulev\u00e9es dans les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes, le Tribunal doit se pencher sur un certain nombre de questions pr\u00e9liminaires. Elles sont les suivantes : A. les exemples additionnels de violations possibles de l'article 13 de la Loi produits en preuve par le plaignant et la Commission; B. la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Warman; C. le statut de la Canadian Heritage Alliance; D. la participation de Mme Guille au site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance; E. la contestation constitutionnelle; F. les mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui ont d\u00fb \u00eatre prises \u00e0 l'audience.\nA. Les exemples additionnels [9] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Warman a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 37 messages qu'il a t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9s du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance et qui, selon lui, contreviennent \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Ces messages peuvent \u00eatre class\u00e9s en deux cat\u00e9gories : 1. les articles \u00e9crits par diff\u00e9rents individus sur diff\u00e9rents sujets; 2. des discussions dans lesquelles des individus expriment leur point de vue par rapport au point de vue exprim\u00e9 par d'autres individus capables d'afficher des articles sur le site Web de la CHA.\n[10] \u00c0 l'audience, le Tribunal a d\u00fb se pencher sur la question de savoir s'il \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 aux huit exemples repr\u00e9sentatifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans les deux formulaires de plainte ou s'il pouvait \u00e9galement tenir compte des 37, ou \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, messages et articles figurant \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C, du cahier de preuve documentaire de la Commission. Les intim\u00e9es s'opposaient \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal tienne compte des documents figurant \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s dans les formulaires de plainte. Le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 que les messages figurant \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C, \u00e9taient admissibles, mais il a pris l'objection des intim\u00e9es en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[11] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, au moment o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses plaintes contre Mme Guille et la Canadian Heritage Alliance, M. Warman a mentionn\u00e9 express\u00e9ment dans ses formulaires de plainte huit messages affich\u00e9s sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance lesquels, selon lui, contrevenaient \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[12] Les preuves montrent que le plaignant et la Commission ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve des exemples additionnels plus tard dans le processus. Selon le dossier, les deux formulaires de plainte qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9s au Tribunal n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 incorporer les exemples additionnels de violation possible de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[13] Les intim\u00e9es soutiennent qu'il s'agit d'une violation des principes de justice naturelle voulant que l'intim\u00e9, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 son identit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations qui sont port\u00e9es, doive automatiquement savoir, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, quelle est la preuve qu'on lui oppose de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu'il puisse \u00eatre en mesure de se d\u00e9fendre ad\u00e9quatement. Le Tribunal est d'accord.\n[14] Dans Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18, le Tribunal a d\u00fb d\u00e9cider si les documents dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi peu avant l'audience \u00e9taient admissibles. La Commission avait demand\u00e9 que soient d\u00e9pos\u00e9s les documents, malgr\u00e9 le fait que les documents n'eussent pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 avant l'audience. Le Tribunal a autoris\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des documents \u00e0 l'audience, sans toutefois se prononcer sur la valeur, s'il y a lieu, qu'il fallait leur attribuer. Le Tribunal, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le plaignant avait bel et bien all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les actes discriminatoires n'avaient pas cess\u00e9, a jug\u00e9 que cela ne r\u00e9pondait pas \u00e0 la question et a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les documents additionnels ajoutaient peu \u00e0 la plainte, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils ne constituaient que d'autres exemples du type de propagande d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9crit.\n[15] Dans Warman c. Winnicki, 2006 TCDP 20, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que les plaintes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal soient modifi\u00e9es pour y inclure des motifs de discrimination additionnels. Le Tribunal a accueilli la demande, la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e pour que soient ajout\u00e9s les motifs de distinction additionnels et les nouveaux documents, appel\u00e9s la preuve apr\u00e8s renvoi, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte r\u00e9vis\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision que, \u00e0 la suite de sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, des passages de la preuve apr\u00e8s renvoi avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plainte modifi\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a en outre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la plainte modifi\u00e9e pr\u00e9voyait express\u00e9ment la possibilit\u00e9 que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e9tayant la violation du paragraphe 13(1) allaient \u00eatre produits en incluant les mots et par la suite \u00e0 la date de l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Il faut noter ici que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas soulev\u00e9 d'objection quand la Commission a introduit la preuve apr\u00e8s renvoi, ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[16] Dans Warman c. Kouba, 2006 TCDP 50, cependant, des documents qui \u00e9taient post\u00e9rieurs au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en preuve de la violation continue de l'article 13 de la Loi qui \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans le formulaire de plainte, sans que soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9e de requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire modifier la plainte. Le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la preuve qui \u00e9tait post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Il a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur le fait que l'intim\u00e9 ne s'\u00e9tait pas oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la production des documents post\u00e9rieurs au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, que la preuve portait sur le caract\u00e8re continu des violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es de la Loi et que l'intim\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 au moyen du formulaire de plainte et de la divulgation de la preuve que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels seraient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience.\n[17] Dans une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure, Le Blanc c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, (1992) 18 C.H.R.R. D\/57, la Commission a produit une preuve relative \u00e0 des incidents de pr\u00e9tendue discrimination qui n'\u00e9taient pas expos\u00e9s dans le formulaire de plainte. Le Tribunal a entendu cette preuve. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que la Commission ait fourni \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e les pr\u00e9cisions concernant chacun des incidents de discrimination qui \u00e9tait invoqu\u00e9 dans le formulaire de plainte. Cependant, il a par la suite affirm\u00e9 que, dans le cadre d'une audience administrative comme celle-l\u00e0, la Commission et le plaignant ne doivent pas n\u00e9cessairement s'en tenir \u00e0 ce qui est explicitement \u00e9crit dans le formulaire de plainte. Le Tribunal a en outre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la nouvelle preuve devait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e sous l'angle de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de son admission et a conclu que, dans cette affaire, l'intim\u00e9e connaissait la preuve qu'on allait lui opposer.\n[18] Les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 13 de la Loi ne sont pas des plaintes ordinaires en mati\u00e8re de discrimination dans la mesure o\u00f9 la Loi pr\u00e9voit, depuis 1998, que l'intim\u00e9 peut se voir oblig\u00e9 de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire pouvant s'\u00e9lever \u00e0 dix mille dollars. L'ajout d'un \u00e9l\u00e9ment p\u00e9nal \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne n'est pas, comme on peut le constater, sans cons\u00e9quence pour un intim\u00e9.\n[19] Le Tribunal est d'avis que, dans toute plainte relative aux droits de la personne, l'intim\u00e9 a le droit de se voir communiquer tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants sur lesquels le plaignant et la Commission ont l'intention de s'appuyer pour prouver la violation de la Loi. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants doivent non seulement faire partie de la communication de la preuve, mais \u00e9galement de la plainte elle-m\u00eame, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que l'intim\u00e9 sache pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment quelle est la preuve qu'on lui oppose et soit en mesure de se d\u00e9fendre pleinement.\n[20] Le fait qu'on ait \u00e9crit dans les formulaires de plainte, au sujet de la date de l'acte all\u00e9gu\u00e9, et par la suite ne signifie pas que la Commission ou le plaignant peut, \u00e0 son gr\u00e9, ajouter des incidents ou des documents \u00e0 la plainte sans respecter les principes de justice naturelle et d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[21] Le Tribunal est d'avis que, si la Commission ou le plaignant estime que d'autres documents contreviennent possiblement \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, ils doivent, comme le montre la jurisprudence, demander une modification de la plainte de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que soient introduits les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels des actes discriminatoires potentiels. Affirmer que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pris par surprise par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de documents additionnels ne satisfait pas aux principes de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale d'une audience et ne respecte pas le droit qu'a l'intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re contre toute all\u00e9gation de mauvaise conduite qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e contre lui en vertu de l'article 13 de la Loi.\n[22] En outre, il est important de noter que, si un intim\u00e9 est inform\u00e9 que certains messages ou articles pr\u00e9cis posent probl\u00e8me et contreviennent possiblement \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, il aura la possibilit\u00e9 de les retirer, r\u00e9duisant ainsi les risques d'exposer les groupes vis\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris.\n[23] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le plaignant a fait savoir dans ses formulaires de plainte qu'il croyait, [traduction] \u00e0 partir de ces exemples, qui sont au nombre de huit, que Mme Guille contrevenait au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Si c'est le cas, alors l'ajout d'une nouvelle preuve ne fera que fournir des exemples suppl\u00e9mentaires des actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. En d'autres mots, les huit exemples relev\u00e9s dans les formulaires de plainte suffiraient quand m\u00eame \u00e0 eux seuls \u00e0 prouver les all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es par la Commission et le plaignant contre les intim\u00e9es.\n[24] Le Tribunal est conscient du fait que l'article 48.9 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne dispose que l'instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Toutefois, le Tribunal est d'avis que les principes de justice naturelle et d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale priment la rapidit\u00e9 du processus et n\u00e9cessitent que les intim\u00e9es soient enti\u00e8rement inform\u00e9es, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but et tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure, de la preuve qui leur sera oppos\u00e9e.\n[25] La preuve montre, comme on le verra, que Mme Guille, quand elle a appris que certains des messages ou articles posaient probl\u00e8me, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de les retirer du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance d\u00e8s qu'elle a appris leur existence. On peut donc supposer que, si elle l'avait su plus t\u00f4t, c'est-\u00e0-dire au moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, elle aurait probablement retir\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t les messages du site Web, r\u00e9duisant ainsi les risques que le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral soit expos\u00e9 \u00e0 des documents qui violent l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[26] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que l'objection des intim\u00e9es concernant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de documents additionnels par la Commission sans avoir modifi\u00e9 les formulaires de plainte est fond\u00e9e. Le Tribunal ne tiendra donc pas compte des documents additionnels figurant \u00e0 l'annexe 1.\nB. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Warman [27] En l'esp\u00e8ce, les intim\u00e9es ont attaqu\u00e9 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Warman sur plusieurs fronts.\n[28] Premi\u00e8rement, les intim\u00e9es ont affirm\u00e9 que M. Warman est un activiste des droits de la personne qui se sp\u00e9cialise dans le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 pour la Commission. Deuxi\u00e8mement, les intim\u00e9es ont soutenu que M. Warman n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 honn\u00eate \u00e0 propos de son identit\u00e9 quand il a utilis\u00e9 le pseudonyme David Mclean dans ses discussions avec Mme Guille et la Canadian Heritage Alliance. Troisi\u00e8mement, les intim\u00e9es ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Warman avait lui-m\u00eame contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, lorsqu'il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des comptes sur des sites Web racistes en utilisant le nom Lucie Aubrack et the90sareover et a affich\u00e9 des messages, sous des pseudonymes comme axetogrind, qui pourraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme haineux. Quatri\u00e8mement, les intim\u00e9es ont soutenu que M. Warman a donn\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses \u00e9vasives.\n[29] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. Warman, au fil des ans, a plaid\u00e9 dans de nombreuses affaires de plaintes renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Le Tribunal ne peut faire fi du fait que M. Warman est un activiste des droits de la personne et que cela peut parfois fausser son t\u00e9moignage. Cela dit, le Tribunal, lorsqu'il jugera s'il y a eu ou non violation de l'article 13 de la Loi et si les documents produits en preuve constituaient ou non de la propagande haineuse, prendra en consid\u00e9ration non seulement le t\u00e9moignage de M. Warman, mais \u00e9galement la preuve documentaire soumise.\n[30] En outre, le Tribunal est d'avis que le fait que M. Warman ait utilis\u00e9 un pseudonyme, c'est-\u00e0-dire David Mclean, dans ses communications avec Mme Guille et la Canadian Heritage Alliance ne doit pas \u00eatre une surprise. C'est une pratique habituelle sur le Web. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les gens ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent pas leur v\u00e9ritable identit\u00e9.\n[31] Quant au fait que M. Warman puisse avoir affich\u00e9 sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance ou sur d'autres sites Web des documents qui pourraient contrevenir \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, le Tribunal estime qu'aucune preuve convaincante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite. Cela dit, si les intim\u00e9es estiment que M. Warman a contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, elles peuvent \u00e0 leur tour d\u00e9poser une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[32] Pour ce qui est des r\u00e9ponses vagues donn\u00e9es par M. Warman dans son t\u00e9moignage, le Tribunal constate que les r\u00e9ponses de M. Warman n'\u00e9taient pas toujours directes et il prend note qu'il existait une certaine animosit\u00e9 entre M. Warman et les mandataires des intim\u00e9es, ce qui a conduit M. Warman \u00e0 s'opposer \u00e0 des questions qu'on lui posait parce qu'il les jugeait d\u00e9pourvues de pertinence. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, le Tribunal prendra en consid\u00e9ration l'ensemble de la preuve, qu'elle soit testimoniale, documentaire ou indirecte, pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision sur la question de savoir si les intim\u00e9es ont contrevenu ou non \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.\nC. Le statut de la Canadian Heritage Alliance [33] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Guille a affirm\u00e9 que le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance \u00e9tait un moyen pour les gens de faire conna\u00eetre leur point de vue sur la libert\u00e9 d'expression et les politiques du gouvernement, que les gens pouvaient consulter le site Web et afficher leurs articles et leurs opinions, qu'ils pouvaient commencer une discussion dans la section forum et \u00e9changer des points de vue, qu'on encourageait le d\u00e9bat.\n[34] Mme Guille a d'abord affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les individus affichant des messages dans la section forum devaient s'inscrire, mais qu'ils n'y \u00e9taient plus oblig\u00e9s par la suite. Cependant, elle a ajout\u00e9 que, parce que des propos d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 tenus dans les discussions, les personnes ont finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9es de s'inscrire pour pouvoir afficher des messages dans la section forum. Ainsi, elle a pu conna\u00eetre l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique et l'adresse IP de ces personnes. Mme Guille a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cela n'\u00e9quivalait pas \u00e0 se joindre \u00e0 un groupe, mais \u00e0 se joindre \u00e0 un site Web.\n[35] Mme Guille a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, si un individu souhaitait afficher un article sur le site Web, il devait cliquer sur un lien pr\u00e9cis sur le site Web et que cela ferait appara\u00eetre une page o\u00f9 figurait un champ pour inscrire un nom d'utilisateur et un autre champ pour inscrire un mot de passe. L'individu cliquerait alors sur [traduction] valider et que cela l'am\u00e8nerait \u00e0 un formulaire o\u00f9 il inscrirait son message. Une fois valid\u00e9s, les messages \u00e9taient affich\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement.\n[36] Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les individus se joignant au site Web devaient accepter des conditions d'utilisation, lesquelles pr\u00e9cisaient que les gens \u00e9taient responsables de ce qu'ils \u00e9crivaient dans les discussions et qu'ils ne pouvaient pas afficher des messages qui \u00e9taient ouvertement haineux ou grossiers. Selon Mme Guille, le nombre de personnes qui se sont jointes au forum s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9 au d\u00e9but \u00e0 100, puis a diminu\u00e9 pour s'\u00e9tablir vers 20 ou 30, et le nombre variait d'une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 l'autre.\n[37] Mme Guille a dit \u00eatre d'avis que le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance \u00e9tait seulement un site Web. Lorsqu'on l'a interrog\u00e9e \u00e0 propos des membres, elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait plus d'une adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 un site Web, qu'en fait, il n'y avait pas de liste de membres. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il fallait s'inscrire comme membre, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait pour fournir \u00e0 ceux qui \u00e9taient int\u00e9ress\u00e9s au site Web une trousse de renseignements expliquant \u00e0 quoi servait le site Web.\n[38] Les documents soumis en preuve par le plaignant et la Commission, lesquels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance, ainsi que les documents produits par la Canadian Heritage Alliance, comme le Guide des membres, montrent que la Canadian Heritage Alliance se d\u00e9crit elle-m\u00eame comme un [traduction] regroupement d'\u00e9crivains dissidents et de Canadiens inquiets qui souhaitent faire revivre les libert\u00e9s civiles des citoyens canadiens, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9touff\u00e9es par la voix de groupes d'int\u00e9r\u00eat. La documentation montre que la Canadian Heritage Alliance se situe principalement dans le sud de l'Ontario, mais qu'elle a des membres dans tout le Canada et aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Les renseignements se trouvant sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance mentionnent \u00e9galement que la CHA est un [traduction] groupe de pression politique canadien, form\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2000, pour donner aux citoyens canadiens une voix politique.\n[39] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le aussi que la Canadian Heritage Alliance publie un bulletin d'information (Canadian Heritage News) et emploie des journalistes, que Mme Guille est la directrice des publications ainsi que l'\u00e9ditrice en chef du Canadian Heritage News et que des cartes de membres sont d\u00e9livr\u00e9es de m\u00eame qu'une trousse de renseignements.\n[40] Que la Canadian Heritage Alliance ait ou non des membres dans le sens traditionnel du terme, c'est-\u00e0-dire des individus qui font partie d'une organisation, \u00e0 qui est d\u00e9livr\u00e9e une carte de membre, qui ont le droit d'\u00e9lire des membres \u00e0 un conseil d'administration, qui paient une cotisation et qui re\u00e7oivent un bulletin d'information, est d'une certaine fa\u00e7on sans int\u00e9r\u00eat ou du moins ne permet pas en l'esp\u00e8ce d'\u00e9tablir si la Canadian Heritage Alliance constitue ou non un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord. La Canadian Heritage Alliance se d\u00e9crit elle-m\u00eame comme un regroupement d'\u00e9crivains dissidents et de Canadiens inquiets ainsi que comme un groupe de pression politique. Le Tribunal estime que ces affirmations suffisent \u00e0 elles seules \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que la Canadian Heritage Alliance constitue un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord au sens du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[41] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que la Canadian Heritage Alliance est plus qu'un site Web, comme l'ont soutenu les intim\u00e9es, et qu'il s'agit en fait d'un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord aux fins de l'application du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. Le Tribunal estime donc qu'il convient de consid\u00e9rer la Canadian Heritage Alliance comme une partie intim\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce et que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance la visant.\nD. La participation de Mme Guille \u00e0 la Canadian Heritage Alliance [42] Sans l'ombre d'un doute, le dossier \u00e9tablit que Mme Guille est la gestionnaire Web ou la webmestre du site de la Canadian Heritage Alliance. Une recherche WHO-IS effectu\u00e9e par le plaignant r\u00e9v\u00e8le que Mme Guille \u00e9tait, au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, la personne ressource pour les nouveaux membres, ainsi que la personne ressource pour l'administration, les questions techniques et la facturation relatives au site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance. Un message affich\u00e9 sur le forum de la Canadian Heritage Alliance par Mme Guille pr\u00e9cise qu'elle est l'administratrice du site.\n[43] Dans un courrier \u00e9lectronique envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 David Mclean, alias Richard Warman, Mme Guille d\u00e9clare qu'elle est l'une des trois personnes ayant cr\u00e9\u00e9 la Canadian Heritage Alliance. Elle a en outre t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir enregistr\u00e9 l'adresse URL du site Web et avoir cr\u00e9\u00e9 le site Web, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle a cr\u00e9\u00e9 la page affich\u00e9e avec les liens, la page titre et les cat\u00e9gories.\n[44] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Guille a reconnu qu'elle \u00e9tait la personne qui avait le pouvoir d'enlever ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur le site Web, qui r\u00e9visait les messages et les articles et qui d\u00e9signait les mod\u00e9rateurs pour le site Web. Cependant, elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle ne connaissait pas l'identit\u00e9 des mod\u00e9rateurs et qu'elle n'avait aucune autorit\u00e9 sur eux.\n[45] Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 quelle m\u00e9thode elle utilisait pour d\u00e9cider qui deviendrait un mod\u00e9rateur, Mme Guille a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle examinait les messages que les personnes avaient affich\u00e9s dans les discussions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes et qu'elle prenait sa d\u00e9cision de les choisir ou non comme mod\u00e9rateur. Elle a affirm\u00e9 avoir choisi des individus qui affichaient des messages depuis longtemps dans les discussions et avec qui elle n'avait jamais eu de probl\u00e8me. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les mod\u00e9rateurs pouvaient retirer ou censurer des articles. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 s'il n'y aurait pas eu lieu d'obtenir des renseignements plus substantiels sur l'identit\u00e9 de ces personnes, Mme Guille a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne le croyait pas n\u00e9cessaire.\n[46] Mme Guille a en outre t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne connaissait pas l'identit\u00e9 des individus affichant des messages sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les gens ne donnent pas leur v\u00e9ritable identit\u00e9, que le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression et que cela signifie que des questions controvers\u00e9es seraient abord\u00e9es, des questions qui ne font peut-\u00eatre pas l'objet de conversations de tous les jours. Mme Guille a affirm\u00e9 que les questions controvers\u00e9es, pour elle, \u00e9taient l'immigration, la libert\u00e9 d'expression, la race, la culture, l'origine ethnique, la religion et l'orientation sexuelle.\n[47] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait en charge du forum du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que personne n'\u00e9tait express\u00e9ment en charge, mais que, en tant que webmestre, elle s'occupait du contenu c\u00f4t\u00e9 serveur et que, si elle lisait quelque chose qui devait \u00eatre retir\u00e9 ou censur\u00e9, elle le retirait.\n[48] Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il y a eu quelques plaintes au sujet de certains articles, que, si quelqu'un s'offensait fortement d'un article, cela lui faisait plaisir parce que cela amor\u00e7ait une discussion et que, si quelqu'un portait \u00e0 son attention quelque chose pouvant poser probl\u00e8me, la d\u00e9cision de retirer le document d\u00e9pendrait de la nature du probl\u00e8me. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu'elle utilisait pour se guider, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle se fiait \u00e0 son jugement, qu'elle ne pouvait pas embaucher un avocat et que, lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u la plainte, elle s'est rendue compte qu'elle devait tenir compte d'autres dispositions en plus de l'article 319 du Code criminel.\n[49] Compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Guille, le Tribunal conclut que celle-ci avait pleine autorit\u00e9 sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance.\n[50] Soit dit en passant, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que Mme Guille entretenait des liens \u00e9troits avec des n\u00e9onazis et des sympathisants de la supr\u00e9matie blanche ce qui, de nos jours, est plut\u00f4t d\u00e9concertant. Tout au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, elle a qualifi\u00e9 d'associ\u00e9s ses amis, qui apparaissent comme des sympathisants n\u00e9onazis sur des photographies soumises en preuve par la Commission. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'aise de s'asseoir dans une pi\u00e8ce o\u00f9 un drapeau nazi \u00e9tait accroch\u00e9 au mur, elle a affirm\u00e9 candidement qu'elle ne consid\u00e9rait pas cela comme un probl\u00e8me.\n[51] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait une tenante de la supr\u00e9matie blanche ou une n\u00e9onazie, ce \u00e0 quoi elle a r\u00e9pondu que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas, qu'elle traitait tout le monde \u00e9galement, que, lorsqu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9, elle devait faire affaire avec des personnes d'origines raciales et d'orientations sexuelles diverses et qu'aujourd'hui, dans sa collectivit\u00e9 ou dans son milieu de travail, elle n'avait aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 s'entendre avec des personnes d'origines diff\u00e9rentes.\n[52] Il ne fait aucun doute pour le Tribunal que, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance soit un lieu o\u00f9 sont abord\u00e9s des sujets tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licats et controvers\u00e9s, selon la jurisprudence, les associ\u00e9s de Mme Guille avaient des liens \u00e9troits avec les mouvements n\u00e9onazis et de supr\u00e9matie blanche et ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s coupables de violations de l'article 13 de la Loi. Le Tribunal est toutefois conscient que ce fait en tant que tel ne prouve pas que Mme Guille et la Canadian Heritage Alliance ont contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.\n[53] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que Mme Guille avait des opinions bien arr\u00eat\u00e9es au sujet de son patrimoine culturel europ\u00e9en et qu'elle est pr\u00eate \u00e0 se battre pour le conserver. Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu'elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la notion de culture, elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la culture europ\u00e9enne et, quand elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la culture europ\u00e9enne, elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ses origines familiales. Pour elle, les individus ayant un patrimoine culturel europ\u00e9en sont les personnes qui proviennent de diff\u00e9rents endroits en Europe et comprennent celles qui ont grandi en Europe ou dont les anc\u00eatres proviennent d'Europe.\n[54] Mme Guille a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, pour elle, la culture europ\u00e9enne est diff\u00e9rente de la foi musulmane, que, pour elle, l'Europe est une r\u00e9gion g\u00e9ographique constitu\u00e9e de diff\u00e9rentes races, comme les Italiens. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle incluait les gens provenant d'Afrique dans sa d\u00e9finition de la culture europ\u00e9enne, Mme Guille a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'incluait pas les immigrants des Cara\u00efbes en Angleterre et elle a ajout\u00e9 que ceux-ci ne se consid\u00e9raient pas eux-m\u00eames comme des Europ\u00e9ens parce qu'ils souhaitaient garder leur propre patrimoine culturel.\n[55] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Guille s'est d\u00e9crite comme une nationaliste qui exprime ses inqui\u00e9tudes sur la fa\u00e7on dont \u00e9volue le Canada, sur l'immigration et sur la libert\u00e9 d'expression. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 constater que les Canadiens sont opprim\u00e9s, alors que les minorit\u00e9s ont le droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression, qu'ils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de plus d'indulgence et que les Canadiens n'ont pas le droit de s'\u00e9lever contre ce qui se passe. Elle a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre fi\u00e8re de son pays; elle a dit croire que chaque culture a ses propres droits, y compris le droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 au sein de sa propre culture. Mme Guille a de plus fait savoir qu'elle s'inqui\u00e9tait des co\u00fbts \u00e9lev\u00e9s li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'int\u00e9gration des immigrants, que l'argent n'\u00e9tait pas utilis\u00e9 pour l'\u00e9ducation ou les soins de sant\u00e9.\n[56] Mme Guille a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle s'opposait au mariage gai et qu'elle devrait avoir le droit d'\u00eatre pour ou contre le mariage gai. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu'elle s'\u00e9tait rendue \u00e0 une manifestation contre le mariage gai, il y avait des gens d'autres groupes religieux pr\u00e9sents. Elle a dit croire que tout le monde a droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression, qu'il devrait exister un droit sans \u00e9quivoque \u00e0 la libre expression, exception faite des menaces de mort et des actes criminels.\n[57] Mme Guille a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de l'existence de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ni que les articles et les messages affich\u00e9s sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance contrevenaient \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, bien qu'elle ait suivi de pr\u00e8s le proc\u00e8s Z\u00fcndel, comme le r\u00e9v\u00e8le la preuve. Mme Guille a reconnu \u00eatre au courant des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par M. Warman contre M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson de m\u00eame que contre M. Winnicki.\n[58] En outre, Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sente audience, elle ne savait toujours pas ce qui contrevenait \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, que l'audience ne lui avait pas donn\u00e9 d'indication sur ce qui contrevenait \u00e0 la Loi, que la Loi est vague et ne pr\u00e9cise vraiment pas clairement ce qui constitue de la propagande haineuse \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'existe aucune ligne directrice claire. Esp\u00e9rons qu'apr\u00e8s avoir lu la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, Mme Guille le saura.\nE. La contestation constitutionnelle [59] En ao\u00fbt 2007, l'intim\u00e9e, Melissa Guille, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de contestation constitutionnelle relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Dans son avis, l'intim\u00e9e indique qu'elle a l'intention de contester l'applicabilit\u00e9, la validit\u00e9 et l'effet de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne en regard de la Constitution. Le Tribunal a alors statu\u00e9 qu'il trancherait d'abord le fond de l'affaire, qu'il rendrait une d\u00e9cision et suspendrait l'ex\u00e9cution de sa d\u00e9cision pour permettre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de pr\u00e9senter en bonne et due forme son avis de contestation constitutionnelle devant le Tribunal.\n[60] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, en novembre 2007, le mandataire de Mme Guille a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une autre requ\u00eate dans laquelle il demandait au Tribunal d'examiner l'avis de contestation constitutionnelle avant la reprise de l'audience le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2007. Dans une lettre envoy\u00e9e aux parties le 20 novembre 2007, le Tribunal a rendu les directives suivantes, lesquelles sont encore valides : conform\u00e9ment aux directives rendues par le Tribunal le 27 ao\u00fbt 2007, le Tribunal entendra la question constitutionnelle soulev\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e plus tard, apr\u00e8s avoir tranch\u00e9 le fond de la plainte.\nF. Les mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 prises \u00e0 l'audience [61] Selon le dossier, des mesures extraordinaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises \u00e0 l'audience pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de tous : du Tribunal, des parties et de leurs avocats ou de leurs mandataires. L'audience s'est tenue dans diff\u00e9rents endroits. Pendant la majeure partie de l'audience, deux agents de police de Toronto \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents, l'un \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur, l'autre \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la salle d'audience. Le Tribunal a embauch\u00e9 deux agents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour v\u00e9rifier les objets personnels. \u00c0 l'exception du membre du Tribunal et de l'agent du greffe, les gens ont d\u00fb se soumettre \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9tection de m\u00e9tal effectu\u00e9 avec un d\u00e9tecteur manuel. En outre, il semble que des gardes du corps aient \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s pour assurer la protection des avocats de la Commission et du plaignant. Les mesures mises en place par le Tribunal \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer la protection de toutes les personnes pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 l'audience. Cependant, elles ont parfois cr\u00e9\u00e9 de la tension entre les parties dans la salle d'audience.\nIV. IV. LES QUESTIONS PRINCIPALES [62] Comme l'a statu\u00e9 le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Warman, 2005 TCDP 36, au paragraphe 41, [l]'objet vis\u00e9 par l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne consiste \u00e0 retirer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'expression dangereux du d\u00e9bat public. Le retrait de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'expression du d\u00e9bat public favorise l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, la tol\u00e9rance et la dignit\u00e9 de la personne. Il prot\u00e8ge \u00e9galement les membres des minorit\u00e9s du pr\u00e9judice psychologique caus\u00e9 par la diss\u00e9mination d'opinions raciales. Ces opinions sont in\u00e9vitablement source de pr\u00e9judice, de discrimination et risquent d'engendrer la violence physique.\nA. Les questions juridiques [63] Il incombe aux plaignants et \u00e0 la Commission de prouver la violation de l'article 13 de la Loi. CELUI QUI R\u00c9CLAME L'EX\u00c9CUTION D'UNE OBLIGATION DOIT LA PROUVER. Afin que soit prouv\u00e9e une violation de l'article 13 de la Loi, les questions suivantes doivent obtenir une r\u00e9ponse affirmative :\nLes documents mentionn\u00e9s dans les plaintes sont-ils susceptibles d'exposer une personne ou un groupe de personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite? Les documents en cause ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, en tout ou en partie, sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance? Les intim\u00e9es, Melissa Guille et la Canadian Heritage Alliance, ont-elles utilis\u00e9 ou fait utiliser Internet pour communiquer les messages en cause? de la Loi?\nLe Tribunal analysera ces diff\u00e9rentes questions l'une apr\u00e8s l'autre.\nB. L'analyse juridique (i) Les documents mentionn\u00e9s dans les plaintes sont-ils susceptibles d'exposer une personne ou un groupe de personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite? [64] Le Tribunal doit d'abord \u00e9tablir si les documents trouv\u00e9s sur le site Web de la CHA sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres de groupes identifiables \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n[65] Les termes comme susceptibles, exposer, haine ou m\u00e9pris ont pris une signification particuli\u00e8re dans le contexte de l'article 13 de la Loi \u00e0 mesure que la jurisprudence a \u00e9volu\u00e9. Une des d\u00e9cisions ayant fait jurisprudence est la d\u00e9cision Nealy c. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D6450, dans laquelle le Tribunal a analys\u00e9 le libell\u00e9 de l'article 13 de la Loi. Depuis ce temps, le Tribunal a conserv\u00e9 l'interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy aux termes susceptibles, exposer, haine ou m\u00e9pris.\n[66] Dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy c. Johnston, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'expression susceptibles d'exposer une personne ou un groupe de personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris signifiait qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de produire une preuve qu'un individu ou un groupe particulier a pris les messages au s\u00e9rieux et a en fait dirig\u00e9 sa haine ou son m\u00e9pris contre d'autres personnes, qu'il suffisait simplement d'\u00e9tablir que les questions expos\u00e9es dans les messages sont plus susceptibles qu'autrement de provoquer une r\u00e9action positive chez quelques-uns des auditeurs, r\u00e9action qui se manifestera \u00e0 son tour par la haine et le m\u00e9pris envers les cibles vis\u00e9es par les messages.\n[67] Pour ce qui est de la haine, le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 que le terme connote un ensemble d'\u00e9motions et de sentiments comportant une malice extr\u00eame envers une autre personne ou un autre groupe de personnes. Quand on dit qu'on hait quelqu'un, c'est que l'on ne trouve aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te ses d\u00e9fauts. Le Tribunal a par la suite affirm\u00e9 que, par contraste, m\u00e9pris est un terme qui sugg\u00e8re le processus mental consistant \u00e0 regarder quelqu'un de haut ou \u00e0 le traiter comme inf\u00e9rieur.\n[68] Quant au terme exposer, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il semble indiquer que la personne qui transmet le message n'a pas l'intention de susciter une r\u00e9action violente chez la personne qui le re\u00e7oit, qu'exposer \u00e0 la haine implique \u00e9galement un genre de communication plus subtile et indirecte que l'insulte vulgaire ou le langage injurieux non d\u00e9guis\u00e9. Pour le Tribunal, exposer signifie laisser une personne sans protection, la laisser sans abri ou d\u00e9fense, la soumettre au danger, au ridicule, \u00e0 la censure, etc.\n[69] Aucun expert n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner en l'esp\u00e8ce. Les intim\u00e9es ont soutenu que le Tribunal ne pouvait pas juger la v\u00e9ritable nature des documents affich\u00e9s sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance sans avoir entendu de t\u00e9moignage d'expert. Le fait est qu'il incombe au Tribunal de rendre, en fonction des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans la jurisprudence, une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sur la question de savoir si un message ou un article contrevient ou non \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.\n[70] Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kouba, 2006 TCDP 50, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli une liste non exhaustive de onze th\u00e8mes distinctifs de la propagande haineuse, chacun \u00e9tant bri\u00e8vement expliqu\u00e9. Ces th\u00e8mes distinctifs sont les suivants :\nLe th\u00e8me de la puissante menace : le groupe identifiable est d\u00e9crit comme constituant une puissante menace qui prend le contr\u00f4le des principales institutions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui prive les autres de leur gagne-pain, de leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de leur libert\u00e9 de parole et de leur bien-\u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral; Le th\u00e8me des faits authentiques : dans les messages en litige, on utilise des faits authentiques, des informations de presse, des photos et des propos provenant de sources cens\u00e9ment dignes de confiance pour faire des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 propos du groupe identifiable; Le th\u00e8me du pr\u00e9dateur : le groupe identifiable est d\u00e9crit comme un groupe qui s'en prend aux enfants, aux personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es, aux personnes vuln\u00e9rables, etc.; Le th\u00e8me de la cause des probl\u00e8mes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 : le groupe identifiable est tenu responsable des probl\u00e8mes actuels de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et du monde; Le th\u00e8me du fonci\u00e8rement dangereux ou violent : le groupe identifiable est d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant fonci\u00e8rement dangereux ou violent; Le th\u00e8me de l'absence de qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te les d\u00e9fauts : les messages transmettent l'id\u00e9e que les membres des groupes identifiables n'ont aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te leurs d\u00e9fauts et qu'ils sont fonci\u00e8rement mauvais; Le th\u00e8me du bannissement : les messages v\u00e9hiculent l'id\u00e9e que seuls le bannissement, la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation ou l'\u00e9radication du groupe de personnes en question \u00e9pargneront aux autres les pr\u00e9judices caus\u00e9s par ce groupe; Le th\u00e8me du sous-homme : on d\u00e9shumanise le groupe identifiable en comparant ses membres \u00e0 des animaux, \u00e0 de la vermine, \u00e0 des excr\u00e9ments et \u00e0 d'autres substances nocives; Le th\u00e8me du langage incendiaire : un langage incendiaire et m\u00e9prisant est utilis\u00e9 dans les messages afin de cr\u00e9er un climat de haine et de m\u00e9pris extr\u00eame; Le th\u00e8me de la banalisation ou de la glorification des trag\u00e9dies du pass\u00e9 : les messages banalisent ou glorifient les pers\u00e9cutions ou les trag\u00e9dies dont ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes les membres du groupe identifiable dans le pass\u00e9; Le crit\u00e8re de l'appel \u00e0 la violence : on appelle \u00e0 la violence contre le groupe identifiable.\n[71] La preuve du plaignant et de la Commission \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9e principalement d'extraits, vers\u00e9s au dossier par M. Warman, de conversations \u00e9lectroniques trouv\u00e9es sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance ainsi que d'extraits ou du texte entier d'articles trouv\u00e9s sur le site Web.\n[72] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qu'il a statu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le Tribunal n'analysera que les huit exemples mentionn\u00e9s dans les formulaires de plainte originaux. Le Tribunal a cependant reproduit dans une annexe \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision les extraits pertinents des autres exemples que lui ont fournis la Commission et le plaignant.\n[73] M. Warman a affirm\u00e9 avoir appris l'existence du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance au d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e 2000. Il a affirm\u00e9 avoir conclu qu'il s'agissait d'un site Web n\u00e9onazi et tenant de la supr\u00e9matie blanche non seulement \u00e0 partir du contenu du site, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 partir de ce qu'il savait des individus impliqu\u00e9s et de leurs activit\u00e9s ext\u00e9rieures au site Web.\n[74] Dans ses formulaires de plainte, M. Warman mentionne huit exemples tir\u00e9s du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance qu'il consid\u00e8re comme des documents vis\u00e9s par l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les discussions et les articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9s du forum du site Web de la CHA.\n1. http:\/\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/forum\/viewtopic.php?t=492 [75] Dans ses formulaires de plainte, le plaignant \u00e9crit que cette adresse Internet est celle d'un forum contenant des messages selon lesquels l'Holocauste n'a jamais eu lieu, les chambres \u00e0 gaz dans les camps de concentration n'ont pas exist\u00e9, les m\u00e9dias sont domin\u00e9s par les Juifs et les entreprises qui sont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Juifs devraient \u00eatre boycott\u00e9es. Il affirme aussi que Mme Guille a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 cette discussion. Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le titre de cette discussion \u00e9tait : [traduction] Auschwitz : mythes et faits. Ce document est la pi\u00e8ce HR-1, C-1.\n[76] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier les messages suivants affich\u00e9s par diff\u00e9rents individus utilisant un pseudonyme. M. Warman a not\u00e9 que l'un de ces individus, Fearless Beaver, s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un mod\u00e9rateur. M. Warman a affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'est limit\u00e9 ici \u00e0 ce qu'il jugeait r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 comment il avait pu consulter ces messages, M. Warman a r\u00e9pondu qu'il s'\u00e9tait rendu dans la section forum du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance et avait pu les consulter directement. Il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00eatre membre pour acc\u00e9der au site, selon ses dires.\n[traduction]\nPanzer-dragoon Presque tout le monde a entendu parler d'Auschwitz, le camp de concentration allemand en temps de guerre o\u00f9 de nombreux prisonniers - la plupart d'entre eux des Juifs - auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 extermin\u00e9s, particuli\u00e8rement dans des chambres \u00e0 gaz. Auschwitz est largement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le plus terrible des centres d'extermination nazis. Cependant, l'horrible r\u00e9putation du camp ne peut pas concorder avec les faits.\nR\u00e9cits bizarres\nIl y a un certain temps, il \u00e9tait s\u00e9rieusement pr\u00e9tendu que les Juifs \u00e9taient syst\u00e9matiquement \u00e9lectrocut\u00e9s \u00e0 Auschwitz. Des journaux am\u00e9ricains, citant les propos d'un Sovi\u00e9tique ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de la lib\u00e9ration d'Auschwitz, ont affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs lecteurs en f\u00e9vrier 1945 que les Allemands, m\u00e9thodiques, avaient tu\u00e9 des Juifs en utilisant un transporteur \u00e0 courroie \u00e9lectrique sur lequel des centaines de personnes pouvaient \u00eatre \u00e9lectrocut\u00e9es simultan\u00e9ment [et] ensuite transport\u00e9es dans des fournaises. Elles \u00e9taient br\u00fbl\u00e9es presque instantan\u00e9ment, produisant ainsi de l'engrais pour les champs de choux \u00e0 proximit\u00e9.\nAux proc\u00e8s de Nuremberg, le procureur en chef am\u00e9ricain Robert Jackson a soutenu que les Allemands avaient utilis\u00e9 une nouvelle invention pour pulv\u00e9riser instantan\u00e9ment 20 000 Juifs pr\u00e8s d'Auschwitz d'une mani\u00e8re telle qu'il n'en restait aucune trace. Aujourd'hui, aucun historien s\u00e9rieux n'accepte l'un ou l'autre de ces r\u00e9cits fantasques.\nIl (Fred A. Leuchter) a conclu en d\u00e9clarant haut et fort qu'il \u00e9tait impossible que les pr\u00e9tendues chambres \u00e0 gaz aient pu \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour tuer des gens. Entre autres choses, il a soulign\u00e9 que les pi\u00e8ces qu'on appelle les chambres \u00e0 gaz n'\u00e9taient pas assez bien scell\u00e9es ou ventil\u00e9es pour tuer des \u00eatres humains sans aussi tuer le personnel allemand des camps.\nLe Dr William B. Lindsey, un chercheur-chimiste employ\u00e9 pendant 33 ans par la Dupont Corporation, a donn\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage semblable dans une affaire entendue en 1985 et a affirm\u00e9 que l'extermination au gaz \u00e0 Auschwitz \u00e9tait techniquement impossible. \u00c0 partir d'un examen minutieux des chambres \u00e0 gaz effectu\u00e9 sur les lieux \u00e0 Auschwitz, \u00e0 Birkenau et \u00e0 Majdanek, ainsi qu'\u00e0 partir de ses ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : J'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que personne n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment ou intentionnellement tu\u00e9 avec du zyklon B (acide cyanhydrique gazeux) de cette mani\u00e8re. Je consid\u00e8re la chose absolument impossible.\nJe m'int\u00e9resse personnellement \u00e0 cette histoire depuis 6 ans. J'ai lu, j'ai \u00e9cout\u00e9 et j'ai vu presque tout ce sur quoi je pouvais mettre la main, des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de la cl\u00f4ture. Ma conclusion principale : cette histoire en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est une supercherie, probablement la plus grande escroquerie de l'histoire de l'humanit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce jour. Consid\u00e9rez-la comme les armes de destruction massive des ann\u00e9es 1940.\nFearless Beaver L'holocanular est une grande entreprise et l'atout le plus important du sionisme international. Que ce soit vrai ou non, c'est sans importance. Tout ce qui importe, c'est que ce soit important.\nAngry taxpayer C'est juste une connerie sioniste juive. Les m\u00e9dias sont domin\u00e9s et ne sont pas libres.\nLe monde est sous la domination des sionistes juifs. Ils ont tout l'argent et le pouvoir et l'influence et \u00e7a prendra tout un homme ou toute une femme ou tout un groupe pour \u00eatre capable de les exposer et de les d\u00e9truire. Un dur combat en effet.\n[77] Finalement, M. Warman a soulign\u00e9 que Mme Guille a affich\u00e9 un message en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette s\u00e9rie de messages. Le message de Mme Guille, qui r\u00e9pond au message suivant affich\u00e9 par Panzer-Dragoon, [traduction] Je suis un caucasien qui est fier de sa race, l'\u00eates-vous?, est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\n[traduction]\nM\u00eame si la gauche voudrait que nous nous sentions coupables de notre culture, de nos anc\u00eatres et de notre histoire, il est important de ne pas oublier que nous n'avons AUCUNE RAISON de nous sentir coupables. Et il n'y a PAS de honte \u00e0 \u00eatre fier de son identit\u00e9.\n[78] Au sujet du premier message, lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu'elle a fait quand elle a vu que l'article \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 dans le formulaire de plainte, Mme Guille a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, au moment o\u00f9 elle a re\u00e7u la plainte, ces messages n'apparaissaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 plus dans le forum, car ils faisaient partie d'une ancienne discussion.\n[79] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9, au sujet de ce th\u00e8me, si elle croyait que l'Holocauste devrait \u00eatre remis en question, elle a r\u00e9pondu que, selon elle, tout fait historique pouvait \u00eatre discut\u00e9 et faire l'objet d'un d\u00e9bat, car tout le monde a un point de vue diff\u00e9rent sur ce qui s'est produit. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 de commenter ce qu'elle avait \u00e9crit \u00e0 propos de ce th\u00e8me, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait peut-\u00eatre pas lu le premier message parce qu'il \u00e9tait trop long. Elle a en outre affirm\u00e9 que le contenu des discussions pouvait s'\u00e9loigner du contenu du premier message.\n2. http:\/\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/forum\/viewtopic.php?t=303 [80] Dans ses formulaires de plainte, M. Warman \u00e9crit que les messages suivants, qui se trouvaient sur le forum, laissent entendre que les femmes non-blanches qui ont des relations avec des hommes noirs ont piti\u00e9 de ces n\u00e8gres, que la plupart des Blanches qui ont des relations avec des hommes noirs attrapent le sida ou de nombreuses maladies transmises sexuellement, que les femmes blanches qui ont des relations sexuelles avec des hommes noirs m\u00e9ritent d'en mourir et que leurs enfants auront aussi le sida. M. Warman a ensuite affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'agit de la version assainie, celle que Mme Guille a censur\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame, car elle s'inqui\u00e9tait de la conformit\u00e9 des messages avec les lois canadiennes sur la propagande haineuse. Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le titre de cette discussion est : [traduction] Ce qui m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 parler du m\u00e9lange des races. Ce document a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en tant que pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-5.\n[81] Il faut noter aussi que, dans cette discussion, Kwazimodo est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme un mod\u00e9rateur et que, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'un des messages affich\u00e9s par cyanid_assassin, Mme Guille invoque les r\u00e8gles du forum. En outre, il faut souligner que Mme Guille se pr\u00e9sente comme la webmestre du site.\n[82] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier les messages suivants :\n[traduction]\nSonofthesun Beaucoup de gens diraient que ce n'est pas important, mais je crois que ce l'est.

Est-ce que vous ach\u00e8teriez une voiture qui est \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 Ford et \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 Chevrolet? Est-ce que vous m\u00e9langez du jus de raisin avec du jus d'orange?

Mes enfants, quand j'en aurai, iront \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole avec ces affaires-l\u00e0 et, \u00e0 ce rythme, il devrait y en avoir encore plus dans cinq ans. Nous allons \u00eatre infest\u00e9s.

Que sont devenus les instincts naturels comme rester avec ses semblables?\nCyanide_assassin Peu importe ce que nous faisons, nous avons devant nous une longue et lente bataille qui pourrait ne jamais \u00eatre gagn\u00e9e.

Ils ont fait leur choix, tous leurs petits enfants merdeux auront le sida aussi.\nEncore une chose. Pourquoi pensez-vous que ces soi-disant surs ne reprennent pas leurs hommes noirs de ces stupides n\u00e9gresses blanches? Je suis s\u00fbr qu'elles ont besoin d'une queue, mais personne ne veut baiser une fille noire, sauf un homme noir, mais ils sont trop occup\u00e9s \u00e0 baiser les poules blanches.

Warman a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Guille avait affich\u00e9 un message \u00e0 la suite de cette discussion, sans toutefois le verser au dossier. Le message \u00e9tait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\n[traduction]\nJe ne regarde vraiment pas beaucoup la t\u00e9l\u00e9, encore moins depuis que les \u00e9missions et les publicit\u00e9s semblent toutes avoir un point de vue politique. MAIS seulement un point de vue. Notre point de vue est censur\u00e9. (Qu'est devenue la libert\u00e9 d'expression?) Tout ce que je peux dire, c'est que je suis heureuse d'\u00eatre capable de bloquer des cha\u00eenes de t\u00e9l\u00e9.\n[85] Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, \u00e0 propos de cette discussion, que la personne qui commence une discussion cr\u00e9e le titre. Mme Guille a ajout\u00e9 que chaque culture ou la plupart des cultures ressent la m\u00eame chose \u00e0 propos de la perte de son identit\u00e9, qu'elle ne voyait pas pourquoi les peuples europ\u00e9ens ne devraient pas avoir le droit de discuter de ce sujet. Elle a reconnu qu'il s'agissait d'un sujet d\u00e9licat. Elle a reconnu avoir lu quelques-uns des messages au sujet des relations interraciales.\n[86] Au sujet du message affich\u00e9 par cyanide_assassin, Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle se rappelait avoir modifi\u00e9 ce message, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que la personne puisse faire valoir son point de vue, mais en enlevant une bonne part des descriptions choquantes qu'il contenait. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle croyait que ce message faisait partie d'une ancienne discussion et qu'il n'apparaissait plus sur le site au moment o\u00f9 elle a re\u00e7u la plainte. Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la frustration exprim\u00e9e par cyanide_ assassin, elle a senti qu'elle devait lui rappeler les r\u00e8gles du forum, notamment qu'aucun commentaire appelant \u00e0 la violence ne serait tol\u00e9r\u00e9 sur le forum et qu'il serait modifi\u00e9 et pourrait mener \u00e0 l'expulsion.\n[87] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer le terme n\u00e8gres blancs ( wiggers en anglais), elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait de personnes blanches qui avaient adopt\u00e9 la culture noire, qui \u00e9coutaient de la musique rap, qui s'identifiaient \u00e0 la culture noire et aux caract\u00e9ristiques sociales qui y sont associ\u00e9es. Au sujet de son propre message, lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu'elle voulait dire par [traduction] marcher sur des ufs, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle faisait allusion au fait que les lois sur la rectitude politique au Canada sont tr\u00e8s contraignantes et emp\u00eachent les gens de discuter de questions qu'ils jugent importantes, que ces lois sont la source d'une certaine col\u00e8re.\n[88] Pour Mme Guille, les gens ont besoin de parler de certaines choses pour trouver un exutoire. Elle a \u00e9galement reconnu qu'elle devait interdire aux gens d'\u00e9crire certaines choses, mais elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne s'offusquait pas facilement. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle r\u00e9visait ce qu'elle pensait qui pouvait \u00eatre offensant. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle censurait les commentaires \u00e0 propos de la violence parce qu'elle les trouvait offensants ou inappropri\u00e9s, elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle les jugeait inappropri\u00e9s et qu'il n'y avait aucune raison de parler de blesser des gens.\n[89] En contre-interrogatoire, quand on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Warman s'il jugeait que les messages affich\u00e9s par Mme Guille ici \u00e9taient contraires \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, il a r\u00e9pondu qu'on ne pouvait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question de mani\u00e8re isol\u00e9e, et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Guille commettait des actes discriminatoires contre les personnes non blanches lorsque l'on consid\u00e9rait les messages dans leur ensemble et dans leur totalit\u00e9.\n3. http:\/\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/news_opinion\/articles\/pierce\/hell.html [90] Dans ses formulaires de plainte, M. Warman affirme que cet article est la version assainie affich\u00e9e par Mme Guille qui tentait de se prot\u00e9ger contre la l\u00e9gislation canadienne interdisant la propagande haineuse. Selon M. Warman, cet article pr\u00e9tend que l'esclavage est l\u00e9gal en Isra\u00ebl, que l'une des ambassades d'Isra\u00ebl a dirig\u00e9 un r\u00e9seau de prostitution juv\u00e9nile, que les Juifs dominent les m\u00e9dias, que trois Juifs \u00e9taient \u00e0 la t\u00eate d'un \u00e9norme r\u00e9seau de pornographie juv\u00e9nile bas\u00e9 \u00e0 Moscou montrant des enfants qui \u00e9taient viol\u00e9s, tortur\u00e9s et tu\u00e9s, que ceux qui contr\u00f4lent les m\u00e9dias doivent \u00eatre extermin\u00e9s du premier au dernier en tant que groupe, que les Russes ont une bonne raison de d\u00e9tester les Juifs, que les Juifs sont responsables du crime organis\u00e9 en Russie, que les Juifs ont assassin\u00e9 des dizaines de millions de Russes, que les Juifs ont oblig\u00e9 des milliers de jeunes femmes russes \u00e0 se prostituer et qu'ils enl\u00e8vent maintenant des enfants russes pour les violer et les torturer sexuellement \u00e0 mort pour faire des films de pornographie juv\u00e9nile. Cet article affirme aussi que les Juifs qui ne participent pas \u00e0 la pornographie juv\u00e9nile couvrent ceux qui y participent. M. Warman note que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a jug\u00e9 que la version enti\u00e8re de cet article constituait de la propagande haineuse dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18.\n[91] Selon le dossier, cet article s'intitule [traduction] Ils le paieront cher et est \u00e9crit par le Dr William Pierce. Ce document a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en tant que pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-11. M. Warman a fait observer encore une fois \u00e0 l'audience que le Tribunal avait jug\u00e9, dans Warman c. Kyburz, que cet article contrevenait \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi. M. Warman a mentionn\u00e9 que la Canadian Heritage Alliance pr\u00e9cisait que l'article avait d\u00fb \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 pour le rendre conforme aux lois canadiennes et que le plein article pouvait \u00eatre lu sur un autre site, et un lien menait au texte en entier. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier de longs extraits de cet article. Voici quelques-uns des extraits les plus r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs :\n[traduction]\nL'esclavage blanc est florissant en Isra\u00ebl parce que, dans ce pays, l'esclavage n'est pas ill\u00e9gal (...)\nLes Juifs exercent une emprise sur les m\u00e9dias d'information plus puissante aux \u00c9tats-Unis que presque n'importe o\u00f9 ailleurs dans le monde et r\u00e9ussissent assez bien \u00e0 cacher leurs entourloupettes \u00e0 la plupart des Am\u00e9ricains.\nCes malades, je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9 de le dire, ne sont pas tous Juifs, mais les Juifs sont en nombre (...) parmi eux. En fait, ils sont en majorit\u00e9 des Gentils. Je ne sais pas qu'est-ce qui rend des personnes perverses au point qu'elles aiment regarder un film o\u00f9 une fillette de cinq ans se fait violer et torturer sexuellement.\nSelon moi, ces gens-l\u00e0 devraient simplement \u00eatre tu\u00e9s sur-le-champ, peu importe l'endroit o\u00f9 ils se trouvent. Qui plus est, les gens qui favorisent et encouragent ce genre d'individualisme extr\u00eame, de par la supr\u00e9matie qu'ils exercent sur les m\u00e9dias, devraient \u00eatre extermin\u00e9s, du premier au dernier en tant que groupe. Est-ce que \u00e7a sonne exag\u00e9r\u00e9?\nVingt mille dollars pour un film dans lequel une fillette russe, blonde aux yeux bleus, se fait violer \u00e0 mort; 1 700 clients pour un tel film. Et bien, j'imagine qu'il y a des cin\u00e9astes (...) plut\u00f4t riches \u00e0 Moscou. Et vous n'en avez jamais entendu parler avant que j'en parle aujourd'hui, n'est-ce pas? Pouvez-vous imaginer ce qui se serait pass\u00e9 si de vrais Russes au lieu de gangsters (...) avaient enlev\u00e9 et assassin\u00e9 des petits enfants juifs \u00e0 Moscou pour pouvoir filmer les meurtres et vendre des copies du film aux riches Gentils pervers? On en aurait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et on aurait averti s\u00e9rieusement le gouvernement russe qu'il devait en faire plus pour attraper les Gentils responsables et pour prot\u00e9ger les Juifs de ces personnes. Les Juifs se plaindraient encore de l'Holocauste et tendraient la main pour obtenir des r\u00e9parations du gouvernement russe.\nEt c'est pourquoi j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment de r\u00e9examiner tout le sujet des meurtres rituels juifs, parce que, vous savez, \u00e7a fonctionnait dans le pass\u00e9 de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que \u00e7a fonctionne aujourd'hui. Un petit groupe de pervers (...) ou de fanatiques religieux (...) ex\u00e9cute un quelconque commandement haineux du Talmud et se fait attraper pour avoir assassin\u00e9 un enfant gentil, puis un autre (...) essaie de soudoyer les autorit\u00e9s.\nBien, comme je l'ai dit, un de ces jours, ils le paieront cher et ce jour ne peut pas arriver trop t\u00f4t.\n[92] Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le Dr Pierce l'avait inform\u00e9e que le texte devait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 pour le rendre conforme aux lois canadiennes. Mme Guille a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les modifications qu'elle a apport\u00e9es se voyaient par les points de suspension qui apparaissaient entre parenth\u00e8ses.

Warman \u00e9crit que, selon cet article, l'immigration de personnes non blanches et le m\u00e9tissage constituent un g\u00e9nocide contre les Blancs qui est encore plus grave que la Peste noire qui a frapp\u00e9 l'Europe au Moyen \u00c2ge, le m\u00e9tissage est comme le sida et l'immigration de personnes non blanches annonce l'\u00e9radication de tous les Europ\u00e9ens.\n[95] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que cet article s'intitule [traduction] La Peste noire et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par H. Millard et affich\u00e9 par Joe. Ce document est la pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-13. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Warman a vers\u00e9 de longs extraits de cet article au dossier. Voici quelques-uns des passages les plus r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs :\n[traduction]\nIl existe diff\u00e9rents noms pour d\u00e9crire divers aspects de cette nouvelle Peste noire : l'immigration de personnes non blanches, le croisement, le m\u00e9tissage, le m\u00e9lange, l'assimilation, le g\u00e9nocide, le faible taux de natalit\u00e9. Nommez-la comme vous le voulez. C'est la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Les Blancs sont un peuple mourant et nous, qui sommes vivants actuellement, regardons notre mort se produire sous nos yeux. Notre peuple est en train de se faire effacer de la Terre.\nMalheureusement, de nombreuses personnes blanches n'ont jamais entendu parler de la nouvelle Peste noire ou, si elles en ont entendu parler, souvent, elles ne se sentent pas concern\u00e9es. Les esprits blancs sont tellement infect\u00e9s que les Blancs sont souvent \u00e9trangers \u00e0 qui ils sont et \u00e0 ce qu'ils sont, et en sont compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9tach\u00e9s, de sorte que, lorsqu'ils entendent parler de l'extinction des Blancs, ils ne sont pas choqu\u00e9s. Et alors, se disent-ils. Il y a plein de gens sur la plan\u00e8te.\nLa nouvelle Peste noire est bien plus insidieuse et infecte les g\u00e8nes d'une personne, qui la passe ensuite \u00e0 chaque enfant qui na\u00eet. Elle an\u00e9antit des lign\u00e9es familiales enti\u00e8res qui existaient depuis des centaines de milliers d'ann\u00e9es et enl\u00e8ve au peuple son droit naturel d'exister en tant que peuple blanc. Cette nouvelle Peste noire transforme les personnes blanches en personnes non blanches et, en une seule g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, elle peut d\u00e9truire une lign\u00e9e familiale et transformer tous ces membres en porteurs de la Peste noire.\nUne fois que les g\u00e8nes d'une famille sont infect\u00e9s, on n'en gu\u00e9rit pas. Vous pouvez r\u00e9ellement regarder des familles blanches enti\u00e8res devenir de plus en plus noires.\nLa Peste noire transforme les personnes blanches en personnes non blanches. La peau blanche devient plus fonc\u00e9e. Les cheveux deviennent fonc\u00e9s. Les traits du visage changent. Les yeux deviennent fonc\u00e9s. La voix change. Le cerveau change. Ce ne sont plus des personnes blanches. Certains soutiennent que ce n'est pas une mauvaise chose et que ce n'est que naturel, mais personne ne peut contester qu'il s'agit de la mort du peuple blanc alors qu'elle se produit.\nVous pouvez \u00eatre s\u00fbr que personne n'essaiera de sauver les personnes blanches de l'extinction, si les personnes blanches ne le font pas elles-m\u00eames.\nLa Peste noire se cache dans les g\u00e8nes et, comme le sida, elle se r\u00e9pand par le contact sexuel. Chaque fois qu'une personne blanche s'accouple avec une personne non blanche, elle aide \u00e0 r\u00e9pandre la Peste noire et tue avec des g\u00e8nes.\nProt\u00e9gez votre famille de la Peste noire.\nEnseignez \u00e0 vos enfants la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur les g\u00e8nes, la race, l'histoire et les personnes qui d\u00e9testent les Blancs avec virulence et qui font avancer la Peste noire sous le masque de l'antiracisme, de la tol\u00e9rance et de la diversit\u00e9.\nEnseignez \u00e0 vos enfants comment survivre et comment \u00e9viter le g\u00e9nocide, l'extinction et le non-\u00eatre.\n[96] Mme Guille a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que cet article se trouvait sur le site Web, mais qu'elle n'en \u00e9tait pas l'auteur et qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas la personne qui l'avait affich\u00e9. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 s'\u00eatre rendue compte pour la premi\u00e8re fois que cet article posait probl\u00e8me quand elle a re\u00e7u la plainte et elle a soutenu l'avoir enlev\u00e9 dans la semaine suivant la r\u00e9ception de la plainte.\n[97] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle jugeait que quelque chose \u00e9tait offensant dans l'article, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas lu l'article avant d'avoir eu \u00e0 l'enlever, qu'elle-m\u00eame ne le trouvait pas offensant, que chaque culture avait un sens de l'autoconservation et qu'il s'agissait d'une opinion. Mme Guille a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle trouvait l'article int\u00e9ressant et ne voyait pas en quoi il aurait pu contrevenir \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi ou aux lois en mati\u00e8re criminelle.\n[98] Mme Guille a fait valoir qu'elle \u00e9tait d'avis que le sujet de l'article \u00e9tait ouvert \u00e0 discussion. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait d'accord sur le fait que les Blancs sont un peuple mourant, elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle \u00e9tait d'accord avec cette affirmation et a ensuite affirm\u00e9 qu'elle croyait que cette d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait vraie, c'est-\u00e0-dire que notre peuple (le peuple blanc) est en train de se faire effacer de la Terre.\n5. http:\/\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/news_opinion\/articles\/gullet\/christian-identity.html [99] Dans ses formulaire de plainte, M. Warman \u00e9crit que cet article affirme que les Juifs ont assassin\u00e9 J\u00e9sus et sont l'ant\u00e9christ, que les Juifs sont litt\u00e9ralement les enfants de Satan, que les Juifs font l'apologie de l'immigration non blanche et du m\u00e9tissage afin de servir Satan et de d\u00e9truire l'homme occidental, que c'est notre devoir de chasser les Juifs, que les Juifs sont m\u00e9chants et que nous devons commencer la destruction \u00e9ternelle des m\u00e9chants. Le titre de cet article est [traduction] Notre identit\u00e9 chr\u00e9tienne et a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par le pasteur Morris L. Gullet. Le document est la pi\u00e8ce portant le num\u00e9ro HR-1, onglet C-14. L'article comporte de longues citations de la Bible, entrecoup\u00e9es de commentaires personnels. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier de longs extraits de cet article. Voici les passages les plus r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs.\n[traduction]\nPour les Juifs, la Torah correspond aux cinq premiers livres de la Bible. Selon eux, c'est tout ce qui est valide. Mais, voyez-vous, ils accordent plus de valeur \u00e0 leur propre Talmud et \u00e0 leur loi orale qu'\u00e0 la Torah. Consultez le commentaire sur le pragmatisme astucieux. Cela veut dire que les Juifs prennent ce qui fonctionne pour eux. Et ils peuvent changer leurs lois comme bon leur semble pour parvenir \u00e0 leurs fins. Pragmatisme astucieux, ha! Ce n'est qu'une autre fa\u00e7on d'\u00eatre trompeurs. Ils jouent sur les mots, c'est ce qu'ils font. Mais \u00e0 quoi pouvez-vous vous attendre d'un peuple de qui J\u00e9sus a dit qu'ils \u00e9taient le diable, le p\u00e8re de tous les mensonges.\n(...)\nMaintenant, nous avons identifi\u00e9 ce qu'est Isra\u00ebl et ce qu'il n'est pas. Nous avons \u00e9tabli que les ennemis de Dieu vivant sont les Juifs ant\u00e9christs, les descendants de Satan. Le peuple contre qui Yahv\u00e9 entretenait une indignation \u00e9ternelle. C'est en effet une b\u00e9n\u00e9diction de maintenant conna\u00eetre et comprendre la parole de Dieu et de savoir que nous faisons partie de ses appel\u00e9s et de ses quelques \u00e9lus. Nous avons beaucoup de travail \u00e0 faire. Alors il est temps de s'occuper du travail de nos anc\u00eatres. L'\u00e9veil de notre fr\u00e8re Isra\u00ebl, la destruction \u00e9ternelle des m\u00e9chants et la venue du r\u00e8gne de notre P\u00e8re et Dieu, Yahv\u00e9...\n[100] Mme Guille a reconnu que cet article avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance, mais elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas la personne qui l'avait affich\u00e9. Elle a en outre affirm\u00e9 que, lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u la plainte, elle a retir\u00e9 l'article.\n[101] Au sujet de cet article, Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle savait que cet article avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 et elle a ajout\u00e9 que, sur le site Web, il y avait d'autres articles portant sur la religion et refl\u00e9tant diff\u00e9rents points de vue.\n6. http:\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/news_opinion\/articles\/francis\/shocked.html [102] Dans ses formulaires de plainte, M. Warman \u00e9crit qu'il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans cet article que les immigrants africains en France sont en train d'annihiler la civilisation parisienne et fran\u00e7aise, que des millions d'immigrants africains et musulmans mettent Paris \u00e0 feu et \u00e0 sang et que leurs cousins \u00e0 Londres, en Angleterre, consid\u00e8rent les excr\u00e9ments de rats comme un mets d\u00e9licat.

Voici quelques passages r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs :\n[traduction]\nPendant que les millions d'immigrants africains et musulmans sont en train de mettre Paris \u00e0 feu et \u00e0 sang, leurs cousins \u00e0 Londres se r\u00e9galent. Dans cette ville, dont la population non blanche devrait \u00eatre majoritaire d'ici 2010, la police fait enqu\u00eate sur un myst\u00e9rieux torse humain r\u00e9cemment d\u00e9couvert flottant sur la Tamise. Elle soup\u00e7onne que de la chair humaine se vend dans les march\u00e9s locaux, selon le journal Observer de la semaine derni\u00e8re. ([traduction] Chair humaine en vente \u00e0 Londres, Antony Barnett, Paul Harris et Tony Thompson, Observer, le dimanche 3 novembre 2002.)\nIl ne fait aucun doute que des mets d\u00e9licats aussi rares que les t\u00eates de crocodiles, la viande de chimpanz\u00e9 et (celui que je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re) le rat de brousse d'Afrique de l'Ouest sont - comment dire? - gob\u00e9s \u00e0 des prix fantastiques \u00e0 Londres par des immigrants africains dont les descendants h\u00e9riteront de la ville de Johnson et de Dickens. Le torse en tant que tel serait celui d'un gar\u00e7on africain de cinq ans qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un meurtre rituel associ\u00e9 \u00e0 une forme ouest-africaine d'une religion semblable au vaudou. Les t\u00eates de crocodiles sont m\u00e9dicinales, car on croit qu'elles font augmenter la virilit\u00e9.\nComme \u00e0 Paris, bien s\u00fbr, il existe une r\u00e9ponse g\u00e9ographique ou quelque chose du genre pour expliquer pourquoi la future population de la Grande-Bretagne adopte soudainement le cannibalisme, la sorcellerie et le sacrifice humain. C'est la r\u00e9ponse que la plupart des journaux, des commentateurs, des professeurs et m\u00eame des policiers vous donneront.\nEt puis, il y a la v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9ponse : si vous permettez \u00e0 des millions de sauvages d'envahir votre pays, votre pays deviendra une terre de sauvages.\n[105] Mme Guille a reconnu que cet article avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle a eu connaissance que cet article posait probl\u00e8me quand elle a re\u00e7u la plainte et elle l'a ensuite retir\u00e9 du site Web. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir lu l'article apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la plainte, mais pas au complet.\n[106] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle avait vu dans l'article quelque chose qu'elle consid\u00e9rait comme haineux, elle a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative, qu'il s'agissait de quelque chose qui se produisait en France et dont on pouvait discuter. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 de commenter le paragraphe qui commence par [traduction] Il ne fait aucun doute, Mme Guille a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle ne croyait pas qu'il y avait quelque chose de haineux dans ce paragraphe, qu'il s'agissait d'une opinion fond\u00e9e sur des articles tir\u00e9s de journaux comme The Observer. Elle a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon elle, si une nouvelle pouvait \u00eatre rapport\u00e9e dans un journal, elle ne voyait pas pourquoi il serait haineux d'en discuter.\n7. http:\/www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/news_opinion\/articles\/kwazimodo\/911.html [107] Dans ses formulaires de plainte, M. Warman mentionne que, selon cet article, aucun Juif n'est mort dans les attaques \u00e0 New York le 11 septembre 2001 parce qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 avertis \u00e0 l'avance de se tenir loin, Oussama ben Laden est juif et les attaques faisaient en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 partie d'un complot juif. L'article s'intitule [traduction] Le 11-Septembre dissimul\u00e9 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par Kwazimodo. Le document est la pi\u00e8ce portant le num\u00e9ro HR-1, onglet C-34B. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier les passages suivants de l'article :\n[traduction]\nSelon le dernier d\u00e9compte officiel, le bilan des morts \u00e9tait quelque chose comme Gentils : 2 800, Juifs : 0. Ce fait incite \u00e0 soup\u00e7onner que certaines personnes connaissaient \u00e0 l'avance les plans concernant le 11-Septembre de mani\u00e8re qu'une partie de la population normalement pr\u00e9sente dans les tours jumelles puisse \u00eatre avertie de se tenir loin, pendant que le reste de la population demeurait b\u00e9atement ignorante. La question, comme elle se pose ici, est de savoir comment une op\u00e9ration aussi d\u00e9licate que le 11-Septembre, dont la planification et l'ex\u00e9cution \u00e9taient hautement secr\u00e8tes, puisse \u00eatre connue des int\u00e9r\u00eats juifs?\nOn a fait \u00e0 votre humble serviteur une r\u00e9v\u00e9lation. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 dans une publication que, selon les renseignements d'une source australienne hautement cr\u00e9dible, la m\u00e8re d'Oussama ben Laden \u00e9tait juive. Une autre source en Angleterre a fourni le renseignement selon lequel il a une sur qui habite dans un quartier de Londres, en Angleterre, qui est fortement juif. Maintenant, selon la loi juive, si la m\u00e8re est juive, alors l'enfant est juif. Cela donne lieu au syllogisme suivant :\nSelon la loi juive, si la m\u00e8re est juive, alors l'enfant est juif.\nLa m\u00e8re d'Oussama ben Laden est juive.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, Oussama ben Laden est juif.\nMaintenant, je vous le demande, si vous faites le rapprochement, voyez-vous le lien entre Oussama ben Laden (paragraphe 2) et les int\u00e9r\u00eats juifs (paragraphe 1) qui pourrait expliquer le bilan des morts du 11-Septembre? D\u00e9sol\u00e9 d'avoir mis autant de temps \u00e0 regrouper les morceaux, mais votre serviteur peu connu ne dispose pas des ressources du magnat de l'information M. Asper.\n[108] Mme Guille reconna\u00eet que cet article \u00e9tait affich\u00e9 sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance au moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, mais elle affirme qu'elle ne l'a pas \u00e9crit et que, lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u la plainte, elle l'a retir\u00e9, ainsi qu'un autre article semblable. Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, avant d'avoir re\u00e7u la plainte, elle n'avait pas lu cet article.\n[109] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle croyait que cet article pouvait poser probl\u00e8me, Mme Guille a dit que non, pas \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, qu'il s'agissait d'une opinion, mais elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas d'accord avec l'article. Elle a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y avait beaucoup de points de vue affich\u00e9s sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance au sujet du 11-Septembre. Mme Guille a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle ne savait pas qui \u00e9tait Kwazimodo m\u00eame si elle l'avait nomm\u00e9 comme mod\u00e9rateur.\n8. www.canadianheritagealliance.com\/news_opinion\/articles\/unknown\/crimes.html [110] Dans ses formulaires de plainte, M. Warman soutient que cet ensemble de messages r\u00e9p\u00e8te de la propagande haineuse antis\u00e9mite du pass\u00e9 qui pr\u00e9tend montrer les crimes des Juifs au cours des derniers si\u00e8cles, que le juda\u00efsme est d\u00e9moniaque et am\u00e8ne les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres sur les nations, que les Juifs, o\u00f9 qu'ils soient, cherchent \u00e0 envahir et \u00e0 dominer le pays ainsi qu'\u00e0 r\u00e9duire leur population en esclavage, dans le but de soumettre le monde \u00e0 la domination juive (page 1 de 14), que le juda\u00efsme est [...] une infection pernicieuse qui d\u00e9truit le corps qu'il a envahi (page 3). M.

Le destin imp\u00e9rial ultime que les Juifs s'efforcent d'accomplir, ind\u00e9pendamment des \u00e9preuves temporaires et des \u00e9checs en cours de route, demeurera toujours la victoire inconditionnelle d'Isra\u00ebl, laquelle inaugurera le r\u00e8gne ultime d'Isra\u00ebl sur le monde \u00e0 plat ventre qu'il aura enfin conquis et r\u00e9duit \u00e0 l'esclavage, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proph\u00e9tie expresse d'Isa\u00efe.\nLe juda\u00efsme est insidieux, tenace et myst\u00e9rieux, il est une entit\u00e9 qui cro\u00eet et qui se r\u00e9pand dans l'ancien monde comme une infection pernicieuse qui d\u00e9truit le corps qu'il a envahi.

Notre antis\u00e9mitisme sera concr\u00e9tis\u00e9 par des r\u00e8glements ex\u00e9cutoires et des lois inflexibles qui devront \u00eatre et qui seront - que cela vous plaise ou non! - mis en uvre avec les pleins pouvoirs de l'\u00c9tat!\nJoris-Karl Huysmans On doit se demander ce qui diable se passe ici dans le ghetto de Francfort, qui ressemble si peu \u00e0 la Foelistrat \u00e0 Amsterdam, un lazaret o\u00f9 se trouvent les types les plus familiers du Juif, o\u00f9 tant les hommes que les femmes arborent une abondante crini\u00e8re de fils de fer, des yeux larmoyants, des nez en forme de museau de tapir, des bouches b\u00e9antes et des fronts luisants perp\u00e9tuellement enfarin\u00e9s de pellicules.\nDarquier de Pellepoix Versez une larme pour les morts d'Auschwitz.

Les Juifs!\n[112] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Guille a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas la personne qui avait affich\u00e9 l'article qui figurait dans la base de donn\u00e9es d'articles de la Canadian Heritage Alliance. Elle a en outre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la plainte, elle avait retir\u00e9 l'article. Pour elle, cet article semble \u00eatre un recueil l\u00e9gitime de citations historiques illustrant une chronologie et elle ne voit pas quel est le probl\u00e8me.\n[113] Selon la preuve, Mme Guille, \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception du formulaire de plainte qui cite huit exemples ainsi qu'\u00e0 la divulgation additionnelle qui fait mention d'environ 37 messages et articles, a retir\u00e9 les documents du site Web de la CHA. Le Tribunal n'a aucune raison de douter que Mme Guille a bel et bien retir\u00e9 les articles et messages en question ci-dessus. M. Warman et la Commission n'ont pas produit de preuve du contraire.\n[114] Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 un certain moment, il y avait pr\u00e8s de 1 000 articles sur le site Web et que le nombre se situait maintenant autour de 300 ou 350 et que les huit messages ou articles mentionn\u00e9s dans les formulaires de plainte ne faisaient pas partie des articles qui restaient. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Guille a reconnu que les articles affich\u00e9s sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance sont controvers\u00e9s.\n[115] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle avait retir\u00e9 tous ces messages, Mme Guille a affirm\u00e9 que, si c'\u00e9tait \u00e9videmment un probl\u00e8me, l'id\u00e9e qu'elle se fait de ce qui est acceptable n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement la m\u00eame que celle que d'autres se font de ce qui est acceptable, qu'en tout temps n'importe qui aurait pu communiquer avec elle et lui faire savoir qu'il y avait un probl\u00e8me avec un des messages ou un des articles et elle l'aurait sans aucun doute enlev\u00e9, mais que, malheureusement, cette communication est venue sous la forme d'une plainte et que la seule fa\u00e7on qu'elle pouvait compenser pour avoir bless\u00e9 ou offens\u00e9 quelqu'un \u00e0 cause d'un des articles \u00e9tait de l'enlever. Mme Guille a reconnu qu'il y avait parfois eu des plaintes par le pass\u00e9 et qu'elle retirait l'article si quelqu'un s'en offensait. Mme Guille a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'y a eu qu'une poign\u00e9e de plaintes.\n[116] Pour \u00e9tablir si un intim\u00e9 a contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si les documents affich\u00e9s sont susceptibles d'exposer une personne ou un groupe de personnes \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris en raison du fait que cette personne ou ce groupe de personnes est identifiable sur la base d'un des motifs de distinction illicite. Le facteur d\u00e9terminant n'est pas le nombre de messages ou d'articles qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur le site Web, mais plut\u00f4t le contenu des documents et le contexte dans lequel ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus publics.\n[117] Apr\u00e8s avoir appliqu\u00e9 les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par le Tribunal dans Warman c. Kouba aux messages et articles mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus, et particuli\u00e8rement aux passages qui, selon le plaignant et la Commission, contreviendraient \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, le Tribunal conclut que les passages suivants sont de nature \u00e0 exposer les Juifs et les Noirs \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris :\n[traduction] Selon moi, ces gens-l\u00e0 devraient simplement \u00eatre tu\u00e9s sur-le-champ, peu importe l'endroit o\u00f9 ils se trouvent. Qui plus est, les gens qui favorisent et encouragent ce genre d'individualisme extr\u00eame, de par la supr\u00e9matie qu'ils exercent sur les m\u00e9dias, devraient \u00eatre extermin\u00e9s, du premier au dernier en tant que groupe. Est-ce que \u00e7a sonne exag\u00e9r\u00e9? (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-11) [traduction] Ceux qui contr\u00f4lent les m\u00e9dias (les Juifs) doivent \u00eatre extermin\u00e9s du premier au dernier en tant que groupe. (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-11) [traduction] Bien, comme je l'ai dit, un de ces jours, ils le paieront cher et ce jour ne peut pas arriver trop t\u00f4t. (Au sujet des Juifs) (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-11) [traduction] Maintenant, nous avons identifi\u00e9 ce qu'est Isra\u00ebl et ce qu'il n'est pas. Nous avons \u00e9tabli que les ennemis de Dieu vivant sont les Juifs ant\u00e9christs, les descendants de Satan. Le peuple contre qui Yahv\u00e9 entretenait une indignation \u00e9ternelle. C'est en effet une b\u00e9n\u00e9diction de maintenant conna\u00eetre et comprendre la parole de Dieu et de savoir que nous faisons partie de ses appel\u00e9s et de ses quelques \u00e9lus. Nous avons beaucoup de travail \u00e0 faire. Alors il est temps de s'occuper du travail de nos anc\u00eatres. L'\u00e9veil de notre fr\u00e8re Isra\u00ebl, la destruction \u00e9ternelle des m\u00e9chants et la venue du r\u00e8gne de notre P\u00e8re et Dieu, Yahv\u00e9. (HR-1, onglet C-14) [traduction] Et puis, il y a la v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9ponse : si vous permettez \u00e0 des millions de sauvages d'envahir votre pays, votre pays deviendra une terre de sauvages. (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-22) [traduction] Par cons\u00e9quent, la secte juive doit \u00eatre arrach\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 la racine du sol allemand, puisqu'il est bien \u00e9vident que, de toutes les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s politiques secr\u00e8tes, la plus dangereuse est la juiverie, tout comme le plus dangereux de tous les \u00c9tats au sein de l'\u00c9tat est la juiverie. (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-36) [traduction] L'un ou l'autre. Nous devons r\u00e9soudre le plus urgent de tous les probl\u00e8mes, c'est-\u00e0-dire, bien s\u00fbr, le probl\u00e8me juif. Il n'y a que deux possibilit\u00e9s : nous devons les expulser ou nous devons les massacrer. (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-36)\n[118] Ce ne sont pas les seuls passages des articles et discussions mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus qui peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme g\u00e9n\u00e9rant de l'hostilit\u00e9 et de la violence pouvant cr\u00e9er des conditions propices \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. Ce sont les plus flagrants. Sans aucun doute, ils menacent le bien-\u00eatre et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des Juifs ainsi que des Noirs. Ils constituent un appel clair \u00e0 l'\u00e9limination de certains groupes d'individus ou \u00e0 leur expulsion de l'endroit o\u00f9 ils habitent.\n[119] D'autres messages et articles d\u00e9peignent certains groupes de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 attiser un sentiment de r\u00e9pulsion envers eux qui compromet leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9, leur bien-\u00eatre et leur dignit\u00e9 :\n[traduction] H\u00e9, je suis tout \u00e0 fait d'accord avec toi. Tout ce que je vois dans ma ville, c'est des n\u00e8gres blancs et des b\u00e2tards. \u00c7a ne devrait m\u00eame pas exister. Mes enfants, quand j'en aurai, iront \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole avec ces affaires-l\u00e0. (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-5) [traduction] Vous n'\u00eates pas une menace. Vous \u00eates une putain de maladie.

Ils baisent tous les uns avec les autres, et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sans protection. Je propose qu'on les laisse tous mourir. Au diable les n\u00e8gres blancs. Ils ont fait leur choix, tous leurs petits enfants merdeux auront le sida aussi. (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-5)\n4. [traduction] La nouvelle Peste noire, contrairement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, ne s'infiltre pas sur le dos de rats, mais arrive par avion, en voiture et \u00e0 pied. Il existe diff\u00e9rents noms pour d\u00e9crire divers aspects de cette nouvelle Peste noire : l'immigration de personnes non blanches, le croisement, le m\u00e9tissage, le m\u00e9lange, l'assimilation, le g\u00e9nocide, le faible taux de natalit\u00e9. (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-13)\n5. [traduction] Versez une larme pour les morts d'Auschwitz. Les seuls \u00eatres vivants que les Allemands ont extermin\u00e9s \u00e0 Auschwitz sont... les poux. (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-36)\n6. [traduction] Les types les plus familiers du Juif, o\u00f9 tant les hommes que les femmes arborent une abondante crini\u00e8re de fils de fer, des yeux larmoyants, des nez en forme de museau de tapir, des bouches b\u00e9antes et des fronts luisants perp\u00e9tuellement enfarin\u00e9s de pellicules. (Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet C-36)\n[120] Les documents m\u00eames mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus, le langage utilis\u00e9 par les auteurs, le ton des documents affich\u00e9s, le contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des messages, ensemble, laissent ind\u00e9niablement para\u00eetre un air de rancur, de haine et de m\u00e9pris manifestes envers certains groupes d'individus identifiables sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite.\n[121] La libert\u00e9 d'expression est une valeur importante au Canada. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite dans la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s. Cependant, au m\u00eame titre que toute autre libert\u00e9, elle n'est pas absolue. Faire l'apologie des valeurs europ\u00e9ennes traditionnelles n'est pas un crime. Cependant, faire l'apologie de l'extermination des non-Blancs, des personnes qui ne sont pas europ\u00e9ennes, constitue une menace \u00e0 leur existence et \u00e0 leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Faire l'apologie de l'expulsion d'un pays de certains groupes ethniques constitue \u00e9galement une menace \u00e0 leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 leur bien-\u00eatre.\n[122] Si Mme Guille est honn\u00eate envers elle-m\u00eame, c'est-\u00e0-dire si elle d\u00e9fend ce qu'elle appelle les valeurs europ\u00e9ennes, alors elle n'a pas \u00e0 diffamer ou \u00e0 laisser d'autres personnes diffamer les gens provenant d'autres r\u00e9gions g\u00e9ographiques ou ayant des origines ethniques autres qu'europ\u00e9ennes. \u00c0 moins que d\u00e9fendre les valeurs europ\u00e9ennes commande l'extermination de tous les groupes ethniques qui ne sont pas originaires de la Vieille Europe ainsi que l'expulsion du Canada de toute personne qui n'est pas originaire d'Europe.\n[123] Le Tribunal est d'avis que Mme Guille ne peut se justifier en affirmant qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9crit ou affich\u00e9 sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance les articles qui contreviendraient \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi. En tant qu'administratrice du site ou webmestre, elle est responsable de ce qui est affich\u00e9 sur le site Web qu'elle administre et sur lequel elle exerce, comme l'a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 la preuve, une pleine autorit\u00e9. Elle a la responsabilit\u00e9 de mettre en place les contr\u00f4les appropri\u00e9s qui feront en sorte que, si des messages, des discussions ou des articles de haine sont affich\u00e9s, ils ne contreviendront pas \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et ne violeront pas les libert\u00e9s fondamentales dont jouit chaque Canadien, peu importe son origine ethnique, c'est-\u00e0-dire le droit \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9, le droit \u00e0 la vie et le droit \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de sa personne.\n[124] Dans le cadre de la d\u00e9fense des intim\u00e9es, M. Kulbashian, le mandataire de Mme Guille, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve un certain nombre d'articles qui portent sur le conflit isra\u00e9lo-palestinien, ainsi que des articles portant sur la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation raciale. Il a aussi soumis en preuve les paroles d'une chanson d'Eminem, que M. Kulbashian a t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9es d'Internet et qui, \u00e0 son avis, sont violentes, racistes et homophobes.\n[125] Le Tribunal convient avec l'avocat de la Commission que l'usage de paroles r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles et violentes, m\u00eame par un groupe rap c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, ne l\u00e9gitime pas l'utilisation du m\u00eame type de langage dans un autre contexte ou un autre lieu. Cela ne peut servir de crit\u00e8re pour \u00e9tablir si des documents affich\u00e9s sur un site Web contreviennent ou non \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.\n[126] Le Tribunal conclut donc que les documents mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris une personne ou un groupe de personnes identifiables sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite et contreviennent ainsi \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.\n(ii) Les documents en cause ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, en tout ou en partie, sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance? [127] Dans la d\u00e9cision Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc, 2002 TCDP 11\/02, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le terme de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e qui se trouve au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi donne \u00e0 penser que cet article vise, non pas les communications priv\u00e9es entre amis, mais plut\u00f4t une s\u00e9rie de messages qui constituent un plan public de grande \u00e9chelle pour la diffusion de certaines id\u00e9es ou opinions, plan con\u00e7u pour convertir des membres du public.\n[128] Les dossiers r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance comportait une section forum dans laquelle des individus pouvaient commencer des discussions et afficher des articles. Ce forum n'\u00e9tait pas priv\u00e9 et toute personne ayant acc\u00e8s au site Web pouvait y lire les documents affich\u00e9s. La nature publique du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance appara\u00eet clairement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Guille, tel que mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Mme Guille a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance \u00e9tait un moyen de permettre aux gens d'exprimer leurs points de vue sur la libert\u00e9 d'expression et les politiques du gouvernement, que les gens pouvaient consulter le site Web et afficher leurs articles et opinions, qu'ils pouvaient commencer une discussion dans la section forum et \u00e9changer des points de vue et qu'on faisait r\u00e9ellement la promotion du d\u00e9bat.\n[129] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance n'\u00e9tait pas priv\u00e9 et que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 sa nature ainsi que la fa\u00e7on d'y acc\u00e9der, les intim\u00e9es ont communiqu\u00e9 et fait communiquer de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e les messages et articles trouv\u00e9s par M. Warman sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance et qui font partie de sa plainte.\n(iii) Les intim\u00e9es, Melissa Guille et la Canadian Heritage Alliance, ont-elles utilis\u00e9 ou fait utiliser Internet pour communiquer les messages en cause? [130] Il ne fait aucun doute, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la preuve produite par le plaignant et la Commission, que le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance \u00e9tait accessible par Internet, tout comme les documents en cause. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Guille ainsi que celui de M. Warman sont concluants \u00e0 ce sujet.\n(iv) L'intim\u00e9e, la Canadian Heritage Alliance, est-elle un groupe de personnes au sens du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi? [131] La preuve \u00e9tablit clairement que la Canadian Heritage Alliance est un groupe de personnes au sens du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. Comme le Tribunal l'a constat\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce, la Canadian Heritage Alliance se d\u00e9crit comme un [traduction] regroupement d'\u00e9crivains dissidents et de Canadiens inquiets qui souhaitent faire revivre les libert\u00e9s civiles des citoyens canadiens, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9touff\u00e9es par la voix de groupes d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, ainsi que comme un [traduction] groupe de pression politique canadien , form\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2000 pour donner une voix politique aux citoyens canadiens. La Canadian Heritage Alliance est donc assujettie \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 du Tribunal et celui-ci a le pouvoir de prononcer une ordonnance contre elle.\n[132] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que Mme Guille et la Canadian Heritage Alliance ont contrevenu au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles sont une personne et un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord qui ont utilis\u00e9 ou fait utiliser Internet pour aborder ou faire aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite.\nV. R\u00c9PARATIONS [133] Le plaignant et la Commission souhaitent obtenir les r\u00e9parations suivantes :\nUne ordonnance selon laquelle les intim\u00e9es et quiconque agissant d'un commun accord avec elles mettent fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne; Une ordonnance imposant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, Melissa Guille, une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c).\nA. Injonction [134] Le plaignant et la Commission demandent une injonction permanente conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) de la Loi afin que Mme Guille et la Canadian Heritage Alliance mettent fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire qui consiste \u00e0 communiquer de la propagande haineuse au moyen d'Internet ou d'une autre entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[135] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) de la Loi est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\nLe membre instructeur qui juge fond\u00e9e une plainte tombant sous le coup de l'article 13 peut rendre :\na) l'ordonnance pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a).\nQuant \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a), il est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\n\u00c0 l'issue de l'instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire :\na) de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables.\n[136] De mani\u00e8re plus pr\u00e9cise, la Commission et le plaignant demandent une ordonnance dont le libell\u00e9 sera le m\u00eame que celui utilis\u00e9 par le membre instructeur Doucet au paragraphe 169(1) de la d\u00e9cision Tremaine, mais en substituant au nom de M. Tremaine celui de Mme Guille et de la Canadian Heritage Alliance. La Commision et le plaignant demandent \u00e9galement que l'expression [traduction] et quiconque agissant d'un commun accord avec Mme Guille et la CHA soit incluse.\n[137] Le paragraphe 169(1) de la d\u00e9cision Tremaine est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\n[...] que Terry Tremaine, et les autres personnes qui agissent en concertation avec lui, mettent fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire consistant \u00e0 utiliser ou \u00e0 faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement, pour communiquer des messages du genre de ceux qui ont ici \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s contraires au paragraphe 13(1), ou tout autre message pr\u00e9sentant un contenu sensiblement analogue, qui sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable en raison d'un motif de distinction illicite, contrevenant ainsi au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[138] Les intim\u00e9es ont soutenu dans leurs observations \u00e9crites que, si le Tribunal devait conclure d\u00e9favorablement en l'esp\u00e8ce, il devrait imposer une injonction limit\u00e9e \u00e0 un an. Selon les intim\u00e9es, une injonction sans limite \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une peine \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9. Les intim\u00e9es ont soutenu qu'une injonction \u00e0 vie ferait en sorte qu'il serait tr\u00e8s risqu\u00e9 pour Mme Guille de jamais aborder un jour les questions controvers\u00e9es qui sont le sujet de la pr\u00e9sente plainte sur l'Internet et ont fait savoir que la demande d'une telle injonction laisse fortement croire que le but r\u00e9el de la plainte est de museler un opposant politique et non de r\u00e9parer un acte discriminatoire.\n[139] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 le r\u00f4le r\u00e9parateur de la Loi et les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s au Tribunal par l'article 54 de la Loi, le Tribunal rendra une injonction et exigera que Mme Guille, en consultation avec la Commission, prenne des mesures pour mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire ou emp\u00eacher que le m\u00eame acte ou un acte semblable se produise \u00e0 l'avenir.\nB. Ordonnance de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire [140] Le plaignant et la Commission demandent qu'il soit ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Guille de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) de la Loi. Dans leurs observations finales conjointes, la Commission et le plaignant ont soutenu qu'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 7 500 $, semblable \u00e0 celle impos\u00e9e dans l'affaire Kyburz, serait appropri\u00e9e.\n[141] Selon l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) de la Loi, le Tribunal peut rendre une ordonnance imposant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 qui a contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire d'au plus 10 000 $.\n[142] Le paragraphe 54(1.1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit les \u00e9l\u00e9ments que le Tribunal doit prendre en consid\u00e9ration lorsqu'il ordonne le paiement de cette sanction. Le Tribunal doit tenir compte :\nde la nature et de la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que des circonstances l'entourant; de la nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte, des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de son auteur et de sa capacit\u00e9 de payer.\n[143] Un examen de la jurisprudence r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le Tribunal a impos\u00e9 les sanctions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s aux intim\u00e9s jug\u00e9s coupables d'avoir contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.\n1. Warman c. Tremaine, 2007 TCDP 2 : 4 000 $\n[144] Le Tribunal a conclu dans la d\u00e9cision Tremaine que l'intim\u00e9 avait lui-m\u00eame affich\u00e9 de nombreux messages haineux qui \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s m\u00e9prisants et tr\u00e8s blessants. Ceux-ci qualifiaient de mauvais et de criminels les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s. Ils qualifiaient les Juifs de parasites et de vermines. Ils pr\u00e9tendaient que les Noirs avaient une intelligence inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle des Blancs. Ils appelaient \u00e0 l'expulsion des Juifs, des Noirs et des autres non-Blancs du Canada. Ces messages \u00e9taient malicieux, malveillants et extr\u00eames dans le caract\u00e8re violent de leur r\u00e9sonance.\n[145] Le Tribunal a fait observer, au cr\u00e9dit de l'intim\u00e9, que rien ne donnait \u00e0 penser qu'il s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires avant de commencer \u00e0 afficher des articles sur le site Web Stormfront en 2004. Dans l'\u00e9tablissement de la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire \u00e0 imposer, le Tribunal a aussi pris en compte le fait que, durant une p\u00e9riode d'environ dix mois, apr\u00e8s que la plainte lui fut signifi\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9 s'\u00e9tait abstenu d'afficher des messages et qu'il avait m\u00eame, \u00e0 un certain moment, d\u00e9savou\u00e9 et r\u00e9pudi\u00e9 tous ses messages.\n[146] Quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue des messages haineux, le Tribunal a conclu que l'intim\u00e9 avait, au 28 juillet 2006, affich\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de 1 900 messages sur le site Stormfront. Comme le Tribunal n'avait pas vu ni lu tous ces messages, il n'aurait pu, en toute justice pour l'intim\u00e9, conclure que tous renfermaient des messages haineux de la nature de ceux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 produits comme preuve. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n'aurait pu arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que le nombre de messages affich\u00e9s militait en faveur d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e du registre.\n[147] Le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que la volont\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'intim\u00e9 de commettre les actes discriminatoires \u00e9tait \u00e9vidente, vu le ton malveillant des messages eux-m\u00eames. L'intim\u00e9 avait r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience qu'il s'en tenait \u00e0 tout ce qu'il avait \u00e9crit dans ses articles, il avait refus\u00e9 d'exprimer le moindre remords et il n'avait montr\u00e9 aucun signe d'une quelconque intention de mettre fin \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s.\n[148] Dans l'affaire Tremaine, l'intim\u00e9 a expos\u00e9 sa situation financi\u00e8re. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait ni voiture ni maison et qu'il avait perdu son emploi \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de la Saskatchewan. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il travaillait 20 heures par semaine au salaire minimum, pour un revenu net d'environ 600 $ par mois. Cette preuve n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e, et l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 sur cet aspect, ni par la Commission, ni par le plaignant. Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la nature, aux circonstances, \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 et au caract\u00e8re intentionnel des communications, et compte tenu de tous les autres facteurs, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 qu'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 4 000 $ serait raisonnable dans les circonstances.\n2. Warman c. Winniki, 2006 TCDP 20 : 6 000 $\n[149] Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que les messages affich\u00e9s par M. Winnicki \u00e9taient d\u00e9prav\u00e9s et d\u00e9shumanisants. Selon le Tribunal, on pouvait conclure, en se fondant uniquement sur le libell\u00e9 des messages, que l'intim\u00e9 voulait exposer les membres des groupes cibles \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris et qu'il voulait rallier les gens \u00e0 ses opinions.\n[150] Le Tribunal a not\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 avait demand\u00e9 l'expulsion forc\u00e9e des personnes qui n'\u00e9taient pas de race blanche, qu'il avait menac\u00e9 de commettre des actes de violence contre les cibles de sa haine et qu'il avait appuy\u00e9 avec enthousiasme l'id\u00e9e d'une guerre sainte raciale au cours de laquelle tous les hommes qui n'appartenaient pas \u00e0 la race blanche p\u00e9riraient. Il avait utilis\u00e9 des images photographiques particuli\u00e8rement horribles pour mobiliser ses lecteurs et pour diffuser ses messages de haine avec beaucoup plus de force.\n[151] Selon le Tribunal, l'intim\u00e9 avait clairement diffus\u00e9 ses messages avec une indiff\u00e9rence d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e quant aux cons\u00e9quences possibles de ses actes. Il s'\u00e9tait servi d'Internet, un moyen de communication puissant et omnipr\u00e9sent dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, pour perp\u00e9trer ses actes. Le Tribunal a toutefois jug\u00e9 que rien ne prouvait que l'intim\u00e9 avait commis des actes discriminatoires auparavant.\n[152] Dans l'affaire Winnicki, l'intim\u00e9 a choisi de ne pas t\u00e9moigner. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne poss\u00e9dait aucun renseignement quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de payer, si ce n'est un message dans lequel il d\u00e9clarait \u00eatre relativement ais\u00e9, occuper un emploi stable, avoir peu de d\u00e9penses et payer sans difficult\u00e9s toutes ses factures \u00e0 temps. Le Tribunal a fait observer qu'il se pouvait que l'intim\u00e9 ne soit plus relativement ais\u00e9. Toutefois, en l'absence de preuve de la part de l'intim\u00e9, le Tribunal a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucune raison de r\u00e9duire la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 parce que celui-ci serait incapable de la payer. Compte tenu de l'ensemble de ces facteurs, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 6 000 $.\n3. Warman c. Kulbashian, 2006 TCDP 11 : 1 000 $\n[153] Dans Kulbashian, la Commission et M. Warman n'avaient pas \u00e9tabli que M. Kulbashian participait \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction ou au montage de la propagande haineuse figurant sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com. En fait, il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il avait contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 quelque partie des messages de haine figurant sur le site Web wpcect.com ou dans le bulletin d'information Vinland Voice, avant l'arrestation de M. Richardson. Cependant, le Tribunal a conclu que M. Kulbashian avait contribu\u00e9 par la suite au contenu du bulletin d'information en r\u00e9digeant plusieurs messages, notamment le message visant directement M. Warman personnellement.\n[154] Par contre, tous les messages de haine (notamment ceux sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s sur Internet par la participation directe de M. Kulbashian, en tant que fournisseur d'un h\u00e9bergement Web et de services techniques connexes. Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si sa participation n'incluait pas la r\u00e9daction de la majorit\u00e9 des messages de haine, l'intim\u00e9 avait fait communiquer tous les messages de haine et qu'il l'avait fait de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[155] M. Kulbashian a pr\u00e9tendu que sa sanction p\u00e9cuniaire devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duite compte tenu du comportement qu'il avait adopt\u00e9 apr\u00e8s qu'il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la nature de la documentation affich\u00e9e. Ainsi, lorsque le coll\u00e8gue policier de M. Wilson a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Kulbashian pour se plaindre de l'article paru dans le bulletin d'information qui nommait personnellement M. Wilson, M. Kulbashian a fait enlever du site Web la mention dans les heures qui ont suivi.\n[156] Le Tribunal a not\u00e9 que, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, M. Kulbashian conteste le fait que M. Wilson, M. Warman et la Commission ne l'avaient pas inform\u00e9, avant de d\u00e9poser des accusations criminelles contre lui ou de d\u00e9poser une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, qu'il y avait de la documentation r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible figurant sur le site Web. M. Kulbashian a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il \u00e9tait trop occup\u00e9 pour v\u00e9rifier la documentation affich\u00e9e sur Internet par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son serveur Web. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que, si on lui avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte concernant les messages de haine, il aurait fait retirer la documentation affich\u00e9e sur Internet aussi rapidement qu'il l'avait fait pour l'article du Vinland Voice sur M. Wilson.\n[157] Le Tribunal a cependant statu\u00e9 que cette pr\u00e9tention supposait une fausse na\u00efvet\u00e9 de la part de M. Kulbashian. Il savait qu'un bon nombre de ses clients \u00e9taient racistes. Ils partageaient la m\u00eame case postale que son entreprise, Affordable Space.com. Il \u00e9tait un membre cl\u00e9 du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. Il avait reconnu avoir con\u00e7u le mod\u00e8le de son site Web wpcect.com. De plus, M. Kulbashian avait \u00e9crit des articles et des commentaires dans son bulletin d'information, le Vinland Voice. \u00c0 lui seul, le nom de ce groupe aurait d\u00fb \u00e9veiller son attention sur la possibilit\u00e9 que les messages affich\u00e9s sur le site Web pussent contrevenir \u00e0 la Loi. En outre, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que, en tant que membre en r\u00e8gle du groupe Tri-City Skins, il connaissait vraisemblablement le site Web de l'organisation. En fait, il \u00e9tait si conscient de la probabilit\u00e9 que ses clients affichent de la propagande haineuse que l'une des raisons pour lesquelles il avait choisi d'utiliser un serveur \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du Canada \u00e9tait de se soustraire \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.\n[158] Par cons\u00e9quent, selon le Tribunal, c'\u00e9tait de la na\u00efvet\u00e9 pour M. Kulbashian de se pr\u00e9senter devant le Tribunal et de feindre l'ignorance quant \u00e0 la nature des documents qui \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s au moyen des services d'h\u00e9bergement Web qu'il offrait. Le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de d\u00e9montrait au contraire qu'il \u00e9tait au courant du contenu des documents et qu'il avait consciemment et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment donn\u00e9 le moyen de les diffuser. D'apr\u00e8s le Tribunal, il s'agissait d'un comportement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 au sens de la Loi.\n[159] \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de l'existence d'ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires, m\u00eame s'il y avait une certaine mention dans la preuve qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 pour des voies de fait qui auraient eu un lien avec la haine, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 n'avoir pas suffisamment de renseignements lui permettant de tirer quelque conclusion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[160] Le Tribunal a fait valoir que la Commission n'avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la capacit\u00e9 de payer de M. Kulbashian. Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, le Tribunal avait sembl\u00e9 accepter la proposition selon laquelle il peut appartenir \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer sa capacit\u00e9 de payer la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire. Cependant, dans cette affaire, le Tribunal avait pris en compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n'avaient pas fait l'objet d'une d\u00e9claration sous serment ni d'un contre-interrogatoire. Dans Warman c. Kulbashian, m\u00eame si M. Kulbashian n'avait pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9, il \u00e9tait ressorti, au cours de l'audience, qu'il \u00e9tait un \u00e9tudiant au coll\u00e8ge dans la mi-vingtaine qui vivait chez ses parents et qui \u00e9levait seul un jeune enfant.\n[161] Bien que les renseignements disponibles ne fussent pas concluants, le Tribunal \u00e9tait d'avis que les ressources financi\u00e8res de M. Kulbashian \u00e9taient passablement limit\u00e9es et que sa capacit\u00e9 de payer \u00e9tait par cons\u00e9quent restreinte. En prenant tous ces facteurs en compte, le Tribunal a impos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Kulbashian une sancion p\u00e9cuniaire de 1 000 $.\n4. Warman c. Richardson, 2006 TCDP 11 : 1 000 $\n[162] Le Tribunal a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant que M. Richardson avait un lien avec le site Web tri-cityskins.com. Cependant, le Tribunal a conclu que, jusqu'\u00e0 son arrestation, l'intim\u00e9 participait directement \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction, au montage et \u00e0 l'affichage des messages de haine dans le bulletin d'information du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. La communication de ces messages de haine \u00e9tait de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. Le Tribunal ne disposait d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant que l'intim\u00e9 avait des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de discrimination.\n[163] Le Tribunal a not\u00e9 qu'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni officiellement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la capacit\u00e9 de M. Richardson de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire, mais compte tenu des renseignements glan\u00e9s au cours de l'audience, le Tribunal a conclu que l'intim\u00e9 avait des ressources financi\u00e8res tr\u00e8s modestes. Il avait mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait un [traduction] revenu fixe en raison d'une incapacit\u00e9 non d\u00e9voil\u00e9e. Lorsque le Tribunal avait examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de tenir une portion de l'audience \u00e0 Ottawa, M. Richardson avait \u00e9tabli clairement qu'il n'avait pas les ressources pour payer les d\u00e9penses de voyage et de logement. Il avait besoin de l'aide d'un parent pour son transport de la maison familiale \u00e0 Hamilton au lieu de l'audience \u00e0 Oakville. Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, le Tribunal a impos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Richardson une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 1 000 $.\n5. Warman c. Harrison, 2006 TCDP 28 : 1 000 $\n[164] En ce qui concerne la nature et la gravit\u00e9, le Tribunal a conclu que M. Harrison avait diffus\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e des messages concernant des personnes qui n'\u00e9taient pas de religion chr\u00e9tienne, n'\u00e9taient pas de race blanche et n'\u00e9taient pas de descendance anglaise et que ces messages \u00e9taient d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables, cruels et excessifs. Les personnes susmentionn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9es au ridicule, au ressentiment, \u00e0 l'hostilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la violence, ce qui cr\u00e9e un climat favorable au d\u00e9veloppement de la haine ou du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que les messages portaient atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et \u00e9taient m\u00e9prisants. Ils servaient \u00e0 d\u00e9shumaniser les personnes qui appartiennent aux groupes vis\u00e9s. L'utilisation de propos racistes et de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes d\u00e9gradants \u00e9tait malveillante et insultante. L'appel r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la violence contre les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s r\u00e9v\u00e9lait des sentiments de malice extr\u00eame. Les d\u00e9clarations exhortant \u00e0 la violence et au meurtre donnaient \u00e0 penser que les victimes n'avaient aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rachetait leurs d\u00e9fauts, ce qui avait pour effet de les d\u00e9shumaniser. Ces propos exposaient incontestablement les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine, au m\u00e9pris et \u00e0 un danger physique r\u00e9el en donnant \u00e0 penser qu'ils constituaient des cibles l\u00e9gitimes de violence aveugle. Les messages ne servaient qu'\u00e0 engendrer et \u00e0 encourager l'envie, la m\u00e9fiance ou le ressentiment envers les personnes et les groupes vis\u00e9s, et, par cons\u00e9quent, ils engendraient la haine envers eux.\n[165] Selon le Tribunal, les messages d\u00e9montraient clairement que leur auteur \u00e9tait guid\u00e9 par ses opinions mal fond\u00e9es sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et par son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter les autres. La preuve \u00e9tablissait clairement que l'intim\u00e9 cherchait \u00e0 exposer les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris et qu'il cherchait \u00e0 convaincre les gens \u00e0 penser comme lui. Il avait clairement diffus\u00e9 ses messages avec une indiff\u00e9rence d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e quant aux cons\u00e9quences possibles de ses actes. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement tenu compte du fait que l'intim\u00e9 avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d'avoir commis des voies de fait sur une personne en raison de la race de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[166] Comme facteur att\u00e9nuant, le Tribunal a conclu que les messages d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s au cours d'une p\u00e9riode de temps relativement courte et qu'aucun autre message ne semblait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 depuis 2004. De plus, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas en charge des sites Web en question; il ne faisait que participer \u00e0 ces divers sites Web. On n'avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucune preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'il existait une possibilit\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 affiche \u00e0 nouveau des messages comme ceux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s.\n[167] Au sujet de la capacit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire, le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 que, comme il l'avait mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le fardeau de la preuve relatif \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de payer incombait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9 de ne pas participer \u00e0 l'audience et de ne pr\u00e9senter aucune preuve, le Tribunal n'\u00e9tait saisi d'aucune preuve donnant \u00e0 penser que M. Harrison poss\u00e9dait des moyens financiers limit\u00e9s.\n[168] Compte tenu de l'ensemble de ces facteurs, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une amende de 1 000 $. L'ordonnance portant que l'intim\u00e9 paye cette amende \u00e9tait impos\u00e9e essentiellement en raison de la nature violente des messages.\n6. Warman c. Kouba, 2006 TCDP 50 : 7 500 $\n[169] Le Tribunal a conclu que les nombreux messages haineux en litige qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s au cours d'une p\u00e9riode de pr\u00e8s de trois ans \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s m\u00e9prisants et tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9judiciables. Ils d\u00e9crivaient les membres des groupes identifiables comme \u00e9tant inf\u00e2mes et fonci\u00e8rement criminels. Ce qui \u00e9tait le plus inqui\u00e9tant avec les messages de l'intim\u00e9, c'\u00e9tait que non seulement ils \u00e9taient profond\u00e9ment fanatiques, mais ils exhortaient \u00e9galement sciemment et intentionnellement les lecteurs \u00e0 partager les exp\u00e9riences n\u00e9gatives qu'ils avaient eues avec les membres des groupes identifiables avec les autres lecteurs du groupe de discussion. Ce faisant, l'intim\u00e9 encourageait les lecteurs \u00e0 participer \u00e0 une campagne visant \u00e0 convaincre le monde blanc que les membres des groupes identifiables ne m\u00e9ritaient rien de plus que la plus grande haine et le plus grand m\u00e9pris.\n[170] Pour le Tribunal, cette fomentation active de la haine et du m\u00e9pris envers les membres des groupes identifiables \u00e9tait fondamentalement incompatible avec l'objet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, lequel consiste \u00e0 favoriser l'existence d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans laquelle personne n'est victime de discrimination et dans laquelle tous jouissent d'une chance \u00e9gale, et ce, nonobstant ses caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles comme la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur et l'orientation sexuelle.\n[171] Le Tribunal a toutefois fait observer que rien n'indiquait que l'intim\u00e9 avait commis dans le pass\u00e9 des actes discriminatoires. N\u00e9anmoins, compte tenu de la nature, des circonstances, de la gravit\u00e9 et du caract\u00e8re intentionnel de la diffusion en l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que la sanction envisag\u00e9e de 7 500 $ semblait appropri\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9 n'avait fourni aucun renseignement au Tribunal quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de payer la sanction envisag\u00e9e de 7 500 $. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pas fourni ce renseignement, le Tribunal a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucune raison de r\u00e9duire le montant de la sanction et a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 7 500 $.\n7. Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18 : 7 500 $\n[172] En ce qui concerne la nature et la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que les circonstances l'entourant, le Tribunal a conclu que M. Kyburz avait communiqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e des messages m\u00e9chants, vicieux et radicaux au sujet des Juifs. Non seulement ces messages attribuaient des actes criminels multiples et vari\u00e9s aux adeptes de la foi juive, qu'ils d\u00e9crivaient comme des \u00eatres fonci\u00e8rement corrompus et d\u00e9viants, mais certains d'entre eux allaient jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00f4ner l'extermination pure et simple des Juifs comme groupe. Le Tribunal a fait valoir que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment militait fortement en faveur de l'imposition d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire importante.\n[173] Le Tribunal a conclu que M. Kyburz \u00e9tait responsable des messages communiqu\u00e9s au moyen du site Web des Patriots on Guard. Pour le Tribunal, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident, compte tenu des messages proprement dits, que l'intim\u00e9 avait communiqu\u00e9 cette information en connaissance de cause, en sachant qu'elle bouleverserait beaucoup de gens. Toutefois, au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal, rien n'indiquait que M. Kyburz se f\u00fbt adonn\u00e9 auparavant \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires, ce qui constituait une circonstance att\u00e9nuante.\n[174] Le dernier \u00e9l\u00e9ment que devait examiner le Tribunal \u00e9tait la capacit\u00e9 de M. Kyburz de payer une indemnit\u00e9 tenant lieu de sanction p\u00e9cuniaire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal a fait observer que les seuls renseignements dont il disposait \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9taient la d\u00e9claration non asserment\u00e9e qu'on retrouvait dans un des messages publi\u00e9s par M. Kyburz sur le Web, \u00e0 savoir qu'il est sans le sou. D'apr\u00e8s certains t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce, qui n'avaient cependant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis sous serment et qui n'avaient pas donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un contre-interrogatoire, M. Kyburz avait peut-\u00eatre certaines ressources. Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la preuve avait \u00e9t\u00e9 produite, le Tribunal n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'y attribuer beaucoup de poids, bien qu'il l'e\u00fbt examin\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement tenu compte du fait qu'il s'agissait, de toute \u00e9vidence, d'une premi\u00e8re infraction commise par M. Kyburz. M\u00eame si la gravit\u00e9 du manquement \u00e0 l'article 13 aurait sans doute justifi\u00e9 l'imposition de la peine maximale pr\u00e9vue par la Loi ou d'une peine se rapprochant de celle-ci, ces facteurs ont persuad\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'il convenait d'imposer une sanction un peu moins s\u00e9v\u00e8re. Au regard de l'ensemble des circonstances \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 54(1.1), le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Kyburz de verser la somme de 7 500 $ en guise de sanction p\u00e9cuniaire.\n8. Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TCDP 52 : 5 000 $\n[175] En ce qui concerne la nature et la gravit\u00e9 des actes discriminatoires ainsi que les circonstances les entourant, le Tribunal a conclu que M. Bahr avait diffus\u00e9 ou fait diffuser de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e des messages concernant les Juifs, les homosexuels, les personnes atteintes de d\u00e9ficience mentale, les Noirs et les autres personnes non blanches, messages qui \u00e9taient cruels et excessifs dans leur caract\u00e9risation. Les messages affich\u00e9s exprimaient de la haine et du m\u00e9pris envers les membres de ces diff\u00e9rents groupes et incitaient les autres personnes \u00e0 les ha\u00efr et \u00e0 les m\u00e9priser. Certains des messages consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans les motifs appellent \u00e0 l'extermination du peuple juif, des homosexuels et des personnes atteintes de d\u00e9ficience mentale. Le Tribunal \u00e9tait d'avis que ces facteurs militaient fortement en faveur de l'imposition d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire importante.\n[176] Aucune preuve produite ne donnait \u00e0 penser que l'intim\u00e9 avait commis auparavant des actes discriminatoires. Le Tribunal a pris note du fait que les accusations port\u00e9es contre M. Bahr en vertu du paragraphe 319(2) du Code criminel d\u00e9coulaient des m\u00eames documents, ou \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s dans cette proc\u00e9dure et non d'un acte discriminatoire distinct. Le Tribunal a en outre estim\u00e9 que le fait que M. Bahr ait ferm\u00e9 le site Web presque imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l'ex\u00e9cution d'un mandat de perquisition par le sergent Camp \u00e0 son appartement \u00e9tait une circonstance att\u00e9nuante.\n[177] Le Tribunal n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'aucune preuve directe concernant la situation financi\u00e8re de M. Bahr. Cependant, le Tribunal a fait observer que le paragraphe 50(3) de la LCDP autorisait le Tribunal \u00e0 accepter toute preuve ou information qu'il estime indiqu\u00e9e, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire. M. Bahr, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son repr\u00e9sentant, avait clairement fait savoir que les frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience \u00e9taient on\u00e9reux pour l'intim\u00e9. Le Tribunal a conclu que M. Bahr \u00e9tait un individu aux moyens modestes et que sa capacit\u00e9 de payer \u00e9tait limit\u00e9e.\n[178] Bien que la gravit\u00e9 de la violation de l'article 13 aurait demand\u00e9 en d'autres circonstances l'imposition d'une amende correspondant au maximum permis par la loi, ou s'y approchant, soit 10 000 $, ces facteurs ont convaincu le Tribunal qu'il convenait plut\u00f4t d'imposer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire moins \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bahr de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 5 000 $.\n9. Warman c. Beaumont, 2007 TCDP 49 : 1 500 $\n[179] Dans la d\u00e9cision Beaumont, le Tribunal a conclu que la plupart des messages en cause \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris un certain nombre de groupes identifiables. Le Tribunal a not\u00e9 que Mme Beaumont avait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souciait pas de l'effet que ses messages pouvaient avoir sur les membres de ces groupes ou sur la collectivit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[180] Le Tribunal a conclu que, par rapport \u00e0 d'autre propagande haineuse qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal par le pass\u00e9, la propagande de Mme Beaumont n'avait pas la m\u00eame gravit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que ses messages continssent des \u00e9pith\u00e8tes n\u00e9gatives au sujet de certains groupes identifiables, ces termes n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s aussi fr\u00e9quemment que dans d'autres cas. Mme Beaumont ne s'\u00e9tait pas lanc\u00e9e dans des descriptions explicites de violence contre les groupes identifiables. Sa propagande \u00e9tait pour la majeure partie faite sous forme de messages relativement courts affich\u00e9s sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique. Elle n'avait pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 un site Web entier d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 la propagande haineuse, ou qui en regorgeait, comme nous l'avons vu dans d'autres affaires.\n[181] Le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que la Commission avait mentionn\u00e9 que Mme Beaumont avait affich\u00e9 au moins 1 000 messages sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org, en plus de ceux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve. Cependant, puisque le Tribunal ne les a pas examin\u00e9s, il ne pouvait pas supposer que ces autres messages violaient l'article 13. En effet, comme le Tribunal l'avait mentionn\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision, ce n'\u00e9tait pas tous les messages en cause pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve qui constituaient de la propagande haineuse au sens de la Loi.\n[182] Selon le Tribunal, Mme Beaumont a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas [traduction] all\u00e9e sur Stormfront.org depuis juillet 2006 et que ses pages sur EveryonesSpace.com et MySpace avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9es. Cependant, M. Warman avait fait remarquer qu'apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t contre elle de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, Mme Beaumont avait affich\u00e9 d'autres messages de propagande haineuse qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve dans cette affaire.\n[183] Le Tribunal a en outre fait observer que Mme Beaumont avait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que peu importe la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, elle ne changerait pas ses opinions ni ses id\u00e9es. Cependant, elle avait aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle [traduction] cesserait d'utiliser l'Internet si le Tribunal le lui ordonnait.\n[184] Le Tribunal a constat\u00e9 que, au moment o\u00f9 l'audience a eu lieu, Mme Beaumont n'habitait plus en Colombie-Britannique; elle \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 Calgary. Elle avait 21 ans et habitait chez ses parents. Elle avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle payait un loyer \u00e0 ses parents, bien qu'aucune preuve n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des talons de ch\u00e8que de paye d\u00e9montrant qu'elle travaillait comme vendeuse dans un magasin de d\u00e9tail et qu'elle avait un salaire horaire de 10,50 $. Le Tribunal a de plus fait remarquer qu'aucune preuve selon laquelle l'intim\u00e9e avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 commis des actes de discrimination auparavant n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Compte tenu de tous ces facteurs, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Beaumont de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 1 500 $.\n[185] Compte tenu du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 54(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et apr\u00e8s avoir soigneusement examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence ainsi que les diff\u00e9rentes circonstances aggravantes et att\u00e9nuantes dont le Tribunal doit tenir compte en imposant une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire, le Tribunal n'ordonnera pas \u00e0 Mme Guille de payer une sanction. En aucune fa\u00e7on il ne faut d\u00e9duire de cette d\u00e9cision que le Tribunal tol\u00e8re la conduite de Mme Guille en tant qu'administratrice du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance. Mme Guille ainsi que la Canadian Heritage Alliance ont sans aucun doute viol\u00e9 l'article 13 de la Loi. Cela dit, il est important de mentionner en l'esp\u00e8ce que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne joue d'abord et avant tout un r\u00f4le de r\u00e9paration et non de punition, m\u00eame si la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'imposer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire.\n[186] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la preuve montre que le plaignant et la Commission ont d\u00e9sign\u00e9 seulement quelques-uns des messages de Mme Guille, et non pas chacun d'entre eux, comme pouvant contrevenir \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi. Le Tribunal prend note qu'aucun de ces messages n'appelait \u00e0 l'extermination, \u00e0 l'expulsion ou \u00e0 l'assassinat de groupes de personnes et qu'ils ne tournaient pas en ridicule certaines personnes ou certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements comme l'Holocauste.\n[187] Toutefois, le Tribunal est conscient du fait que Mme Guille \u00e9tait la webmestre qui a autoris\u00e9 que des messages soient affich\u00e9s sur le site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance et qui avait la capacit\u00e9 d'enlever ces messages. Cependant, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que Mme Guille, d\u00e8s qu'elle \u00e9tait inform\u00e9e qu'un message ou un article posait probl\u00e8me, enlevait le message ou les articles en question du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance. \u00c9galement selon la preuve, Mme Guille a modifi\u00e9 certains des articles et des messages qui, selon le plaignant et la Commission, contrevenaient \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi. La preuve montre en outre qu'il y avait des r\u00e8gles applicables au forum et que, au moins une fois, Mme Guille a rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 un participant l'existence de r\u00e8gles et l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il pouvait \u00eatre expuls\u00e9 s'il ne s'y conformait pas. Qui plus est, Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'approuvait pas la violence et qu'elle n'approuvait pas les menaces de mort ni aucune conduite criminelle. Tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments mis ensemble m\u00e8nent le Tribunal \u00e0 conclure, comme il l'a indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, que, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que Mme Guille, en tant qu'administratrice du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance, avait contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, les circonstances ne justifient pas l'imposition d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[188] Cela dit, le Tribunal estime en outre que Mme Guille a peu de moyens financiers et que lui imposer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire lui causerait, \u00e0 ce moment-ci dans sa vie, une difficult\u00e9 injustifi\u00e9e. Mme Guille a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle est une secr\u00e9taire administrative, qu'elle travaille 40 heures par semaine au salaire de 14 $ l'heure, qu'elle re\u00e7oit une pension alimentaire de 325 $ par mois, qu'elle n'est pas mari\u00e9e, que son loyer est de 750 $ par mois plus les services publics et qu'elle \u00e9l\u00e8ve seule un adolescent.\n[189] En outre, le Tribunal ne dispose d'aucune preuve \u00e9tablissant que Mme Guille a commis auparavant un acte discriminatoire. La preuve d\u00e9montre aussi que, lorsqu'on lui a signifi\u00e9 la plainte, Mme Guille a imm\u00e9diatement retir\u00e9 du site Web de la Canadian Heritage Alliance les documents qui pouvaient contrevenir \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.\n[190] Le Tribunal est d'avis que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du public sera mieux servi si le Tribunal ordonne une injonction accompagn\u00e9e d'une ordonnance obligeant Mme Guille \u00e0 travailler avec la Commission pour mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme tel par le Tribunal, comme le pr\u00e9voit l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi. Ainsi, Mme Guille aura les lignes directrices qu'elle pr\u00e9tendait ne pas avoir quant au type de documents qui risquent de contrevenir \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.\nVI. ORDONNANCES [191] En ce qui a trait au fond, pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal conclut que les plaintes qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es et que les intim\u00e9es ont contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.

La d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'accorder des permis de mariage aux couples de m\u00eame sexe n'est rien de plus qu'une moquerie publique des lois de Dieu et du peuple am\u00e9ricain dans son ensemble. Ces permis de mariage civil sont une tentative frauduleuse de reconna\u00eetre les mariages de personnes de m\u00eame sexe sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 avec les mariages traditionnels et cela menace un des piliers de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nL'homosexualit\u00e9 est un mode de vie pervers et inacceptable qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 de tout temps - cette affirmation tient sa v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de Dieu et non de l'homme. L'homosexualit\u00e9 est clairement et irr\u00e9futablement condamn\u00e9e dans la Bible, malgr\u00e9 les tentatives de ministres du culte non conformistes et de groupes religieux apostats de lui accorder acceptation et respectabilit\u00e9.\nLe rejet de l'homosexualit\u00e9 dans la doctrine chr\u00e9tienne est fond\u00e9 sur le comportement en tant que tel qui est une force destructive de l'individu et un mode de vie contraire au bien-\u00eatre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. La doctrine n'exige pas un ch\u00e2timent contre les individus qui pratiquent l'homosexualit\u00e9, mais leur offre plut\u00f4t de l'amour et des conseils dans le but de les faire changer. Par contre, les la\u00efcistes acceptent sans h\u00e9sitation le mode de vie homosexuel. Pour eux, Dieu et ses lois ne sont pas pertinents et n'existent pas : l'\u00e9quivalence morale est leur outil de raisonnement, lequel m\u00e8ne \u00e9ventuellement \u00e0 l'acceptation de tous les comportements, qu'ils soient bons ou mauvais, dans un m\u00eame ensemble.\nVous pouvez gager que nos ennemis au sein de la nation de l'Islam se r\u00e9jouissent de ce pas de plus que l'Am\u00e9rique a pris dans sa descente au fond du puits de la conduite immorale; ils sont toujours pr\u00eats \u00e0 utiliser n'importe quel exemple d'immoralit\u00e9 contre nous dans leur esprit mauvais rempli de haine.

Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier de longs extraits de l'article. Voici les plus r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs :\n[traduction]\nLes fermiers blancs sont convaincus que les attaques dont ils sont victimes sont plus que de simples crimes. Si les Noirs qui attaquent leurs fermes n'avaient que le vol en t\u00eate, ils n'auraient pas \u00e0 torturer et \u00e0 tuer leurs victimes blanches. Les Blancs croient que l'objectif des bandes de Noirs est le terrorisme et une note laiss\u00e9e sur la sc\u00e8ne des meurtres Delafield vient soutenir cette th\u00e9orie. Les fermiers blancs remarquent aussi que les fermiers qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9s \u00e9taient dans de nombreux cas ceux qui \u00e9taient reconnus pour leur g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9 envers leurs travailleurs noirs. Ils soup\u00e7onnent que le but des meurtriers est de vider l'Afrique du Sud de ces fermiers blancs, alors les terroristes frappent pr\u00e9f\u00e9rablement les Blancs qui ont de bonnes relations avec les Noirs.\nCependant, de nombreux Noirs sont plus int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 s'accaparer de la richesse des Blancs maintenant qu'\u00e0 assurer la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 de leur pays plus tard. En outre, l'id\u00e9e d'expulser les Blancs est attrayante pour de nombreux Noirs au plan \u00e9motionnel. Le fait d'\u00eatre d\u00e9pendants de la productivit\u00e9 des fermiers blancs est exasp\u00e9rant pour les Noirs et ils sont plus enclins \u00e0 tuer la poule maintenant qu'\u00e0 continuer de recueillir les ufs d'or.\nEt bien s\u00fbr, les Noirs sont all\u00e9s tuer les Blancs d'une fa\u00e7on typiquement noire, avec beaucoup de viols collectifs et de mutilations. Des femmes blanches se sont fait trancher les seins \u00e0 la machette. Des petites filles blanches ont litt\u00e9ralement \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9es \u00e0 mort par de longues files de Noirs souriants, pendant que leurs parents \u00e9taient forc\u00e9s \u00e0 la pointe du fusil de regarder. Les petits gar\u00e7ons blancs \u00e9taient \u00e9ventr\u00e9s et se faisaient arracher les entrailles.\nLes Sud-Africains ont trahi les Rhod\u00e9siens en 1976 en partie parce que les Juifs de l'Afrique du Sud avaient toujours eu une forte influence sur le gouvernement sud-africain au moyen des m\u00e9dias qu'ils contr\u00f4laient et de leur argent. Harry Oppenheimer, avec ses vastes possessions en diamants, en or et en autres min\u00e9raux avait plus d'argent avec lequel corrompre les politiciens que quiconque en Afrique du Sud. Et les Juifs, bien s\u00fbr, \u00e9taient aussi implacablement hostiles envers les Blancs de la Rhod\u00e9sie qu'ils l'avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 contre les autres Blancs partout ailleurs depuis toujours.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me le\u00e7on que nous devons tirer de l'exp\u00e9rience sud-africaine est que nous ne pouvons permettre \u00e0 nos m\u00e9dias de masse de demeurer aux mains des Juifs ou aux mains de ceux qui sont sous l'influence des Juifs. Les Sud-Africains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assez b\u00eates pour se faire manipuler et c'\u00e9tait les m\u00e9dias de masse plus que toute autre chose qui les ont manipul\u00e9s.\nLa troisi\u00e8me chose que nous devons apprendre de l'exp\u00e9rience des Blancs en Afrique est que la seule fa\u00e7on pour notre peuple de survivre et de prosp\u00e9rer est de vivre avec les siens. Les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s multiraciales ne fonctionnent pas et ne peuvent pas fonctionner. Si nous permettons que les Blancs deviennent une minorit\u00e9 en Am\u00e9rique au cours du prochain si\u00e8cle, comme les adeptes de Clinton le planifient, alors nous subirons un sort semblable \u00e0 celui des Blancs partout ailleurs o\u00f9 ils ont accept\u00e9 de devenir une minorit\u00e9. Ce que nous devons faire pour \u00e9viter de devenir une minorit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre extraordinairement difficile, mais nous devons le faire pour survivre. L'extinction de notre peuple est l'autre solution.\nHR-1, onglet C-15\nCet article s'intitule [traduction] La solution finale des Juifs pour les Blancs. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier les extraits suivants :\n[traduction]\nCependant, ce m\u00eame groupe de personnes essaie de d\u00e9truire l'instinct de race de sa population d'accueil une fois pour toute, en encourageant le m\u00e9lange des races ainsi qu'en faisant la promotion de l'invasion des patries blanches par des nu\u00e9es de non-Blancs qui se reproduisent plus vite. Le m\u00e9lange des races et l'engloutissement num\u00e9rique entra\u00eeneraient l'\u00e9radication ethnique des Blancs et leur remplacement subs\u00e9quent par une masse ab\u00e2tardie de races m\u00e9lang\u00e9es.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, le probl\u00e8me de la fiert\u00e9 raciale des Blancs, qui historiquement a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 le fl\u00e9au des Juifs, sera neutralis\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s. C'est la solution finale des Juifs pour le probl\u00e8me historique de l'instinct de race des Blancs : la dissolution des Blancs par le m\u00e9tissage et par le surnombre des non-Blancs. En d'autres mots, le probl\u00e8me de la fiert\u00e9 blanche est r\u00e9solu une fois pour toute par le g\u00e9nocide des Blancs eux-m\u00eames.\nEn inondant les anciennes patries blanches de non-Blancs et en favorisant le m\u00e9tissage, le probl\u00e8me de l'instinct de race des Blancs sera effectivement r\u00e9solu pour tous les temps par la dissolution. Apr\u00e8s, les Juifs pourront sans doute assumer leur position traditionnelle de domination et de contr\u00f4le de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, mais pour la premi\u00e8re fois, il n'y aura pas d'opposition, car la population ab\u00e2tardie ne pourra pas affirmer sa fiert\u00e9 raciale, parce que par d\u00e9finition, elle n'en n'aura pas. D\u00e9pourvue d'un sens profond de fiert\u00e9 raciale, la population mul\u00e2tre ne sera pas capable de s'opposer au r\u00e9gime juif ou de le renverser.\nLes Juifs ont utilis\u00e9 le pouvoir de leurs m\u00e9dias et de leur argent pour appeler racisme l'instinct de race naturel et sain qu'ont tous les gens et ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le racisme blanc pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment est \u00e0 l'origine de presque tous les maux du monde. Il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 que les Blancs se sont sentis coupables d'avoir un instinct naturel en eux, tout comme certaines sectes chr\u00e9tiennes incitaient leurs adeptes \u00e0 se sentir coupables d'avoir des instincts sexuels.\nLa r\u00e9ussite la plus spectaculaire des Juifs dans leur effort pour que les Blancs se sentent coupables est le r\u00e9cit de l'Holocauste.\nDans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s blanches, les Juifs ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 traditionnellement consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme suspects et esth\u00e9tiquement ind\u00e9sirables. \u00c9galement, bien que de nombreux Juifs aujourd'hui aient obtenu des g\u00e8nes blancs comme des yeux bleus, le prototype du Juif aux cheveux noirs, au teint basan\u00e9, aux yeux de koala et au grand nez crochu demeure encore r\u00e9pandu. Ainsi on pouvait distinguer le Juif au sein de sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'accueil, particuli\u00e8rement dans les pays du nord de l'Europe. Aujourd'hui, des milliers de Juifs paient chaque ann\u00e9e pour camoufler leurs propres traits afin de ressembler \u00e0 des Aryens en recourant \u00e0 la chirurgie pour rendre leur nez conforme aux normes europ\u00e9ennes d'esth\u00e9tique.\nBref, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, la civilisation europ\u00e9enne historiquement s'est m\u00e9fi\u00e9e des Juifs, les a fuis et les a marginalis\u00e9s. Il est probable qu'il existe un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de rancur et d'envie, voire m\u00eame de revanche, dans l'effort des Juifs pour dissoudre la race blanche.\nLes Blancs qui se pr\u00e9occupent de leur race peuvent renverser cette tendance. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape est de prendre conscience de son existence et de d\u00e9velopper la volont\u00e9 d'y survivre - principalement en adoptant une strat\u00e9gie d'organisation. [...] Il est d'une importance primordiale pour le succ\u00e8s de cette strat\u00e9gie que les m\u00e9dias de masse, tant sous leur forme non conventionnelle que, plus tard sous leur forme traditionnelle, puissent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s afin de racialiser, de mobiliser et d'unifier le peuple blanc et de recruter des membres pour des organisations et des groupes tactiques.\nHR-1, onglet C-16\nLe titre de cet article est [traduction] Aux racistes blancs . \u00c0 l'audience, M.

La population de la race blanche (et PAS la population des soi-disant nations blanches, dont presque toute la croissance est due aux immigrants brun-noir et brun-jaune) est actuellement en D\u00c9CROISSANCE au rythme d'environ 1 % par ann\u00e9e. Cela signifie que d'ici l'an 2050, la population mondiale sera d'environ 12 milliards, mais seulement 500 millions auront un patrimoine g\u00e9n\u00e9tique principalement blanc, et il y aura encore moins de Blancs purs.\nSubir un avortement [...] vaut mieux dans la plupart des cas que d'avoir un enfant non d\u00e9sir\u00e9.

Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par un non-Blanc qui soutient activement et encourage la d\u00e9possession des personnes blanches; un homme qui, lorsqu'on lui parle de m\u00e9tissage, affirme qu'il est tout \u00e0 fait en faveur. N\u00e9anmoins, ce type d'homme est rare en Am\u00e9rique de nos jours : c'est un homme qui dit franchement ce que les autres n'osent pas dire ou m\u00eame penser. Ainsi, nous sommes chanceux d'en entendre parler. Ses v\u00e9rit\u00e9s sont un avertissement pour tous les Am\u00e9ricains blancs. Faites attention \u00e0 son avertissement \u00e0 l'Occident :\nD'ici 2030, les immigrants, leurs conjoints blancs et d'autres minorit\u00e9s constitueront 70 % de la population am\u00e9ricaine. \u00c0 la demande g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les organismes d'application de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rechercheront tous les Blancs qui r\u00e9sistent et les am\u00e8neront dans des camps de concentration.\nEn 2050, les Blancs constitueront 15 % de la population des \u00c9tats-Unis. Les Nations Unies remplaceront le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral des \u00c9tats-Unis. D'autres nations occidentales seront oblig\u00e9es, sous la surveillance des Nations Unies, d'accepter des millions d'Africains, d'Asiatiques et de citoyens du Moyen-Orient. La plan\u00e8te deviendra un enjeu entre Africains et Asiatiques seulement. Devinez qui gagnera la partie.\nLes Am\u00e9ricains blancs ont en moyenne 1,8 enfant par couple et ce nombre est en baisse. Le nombre de couples est \u00e9galement en baisse, car l'homosexualit\u00e9 et le fait de ne pas avoir d'enfant devient de plus en plus \u00e0 la mode chez les Blancs. Je pr\u00e9dis que, au m\u00eame moment, 10 % des Caucasiens \u00e9pouseront des non-Blancs, pendant que les immigrants non blancs continueront \u00e0 affluer en grand nombre et \u00e0 avoir plus d'enfants par couple.\nCe n'est qu'une question de temps avant que \u00c9.-U.A. ne veuille dire \u00c9tats-Unis d'Asie.\nIl se peut que nous ne soyons jamais capable de vaincre l'Occident militairement, mais nous pouvons tr\u00e8s certainement le battre g\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement.\nLes enfants am\u00e9ricains apprennent d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole que les autochtones des Premi\u00e8res nations - les Mongols - sont les vrais propri\u00e9taires de ce continent. Ils sont maintenant en train d'apprendre que les Europ\u00e9ens ont commis des crimes en tant qu'envahisseurs et qu'usurpateurs et bient\u00f4t, tous les enfants am\u00e9ricains qui vont \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole apprendront quel est leur destin ultime et le but derri\u00e8re tout cela; les nouveaux \u00c9tats-Unis d'Asie.\nLe mot racisme a \u00e9t\u00e9 transform\u00e9 en un synonyme de mal. Mais le racisme signifie seulement avoir un instinct de race - un sentiment d'affinit\u00e9 avec ses fr\u00e8res et surs de race, un sentiment de compr\u00e9hension et d'appartenance, le sentiment de faire partie d'une culture, d'\u00eatre partie \u00e0 quelque chose de plus grand que sa personne.\nL'instinct de race est inn\u00e9 en nous. Il est bon et naturel. Et c'est l'un des mensonges les plus horribles de notre si\u00e8cle que de le d\u00e9crire comme quelque chose de mauvais. Si vous d\u00e9sirez qualifier notre instinct de race normal de racisme, qu'il en soit ainsi. Nous appellerons cet instinct racisme.\nTant qu'il y aura des races, il y aura du racisme. C'est inn\u00e9, cela a un but \u00e9volutionnaire et une valeur de survie et il existe m\u00eame chez les esp\u00e8ces non humaines. L'instinct de race a autant de chances de dispara\u00eetre que l'instinct sexuel.\n\u00c0 l'heure actuelle, le racisme est bon et n\u00e9cessaire pour que les souches existantes d'\u00eatres humains continuent \u00e0 cr\u00e9er de nouvelles branches. L'\u00e9volution, \u00e0 ce que nous sachions, s'effectue principalement par de telles ramifications et l'instinct de race est une partie importante de ce qui garde ces branches distinctes. \u00c0 un certain point, l'homo sapiens sapiens a refus\u00e9 de se reproduire avec les sous-hommes qui l'entouraient.\nLes lib\u00e9raux sont tr\u00e8s influen\u00e7ables et sont r\u00e9ellement les victimes et non les cr\u00e9ateurs de l'id\u00e9e que les races n'existent pas, mais cette escroquerie avantagera certaines races. Il est pratique de d\u00e9moniser et de d\u00e9shumaniser les peuples contre lesquels vous allez commettre un g\u00e9nocide. Et il est plus facile de commettre un g\u00e9nocide quand vous convainquez vos hommes de main que les victimes n'existent pas r\u00e9ellement. C'est \u00e0 \u00e7a que sert r\u00e9ellement l'arnaque selon laquelle la race blanche n'existe pas. C'est un mandat pour le g\u00e9nocide.\nUn concept bien plus important dans le m\u00e9lange des races humaines est la r\u00e9gression \u00e0 la moyenne. Cela signifie que, m\u00eame si vous accouplez un g\u00e9nie n\u00e8gre avec une personne blanche, le fruit en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pr\u00e9sentera des caract\u00e9ristiques n\u00e9gro\u00efdes plus typiques du n\u00e8gre moyen, et pas n\u00e9cessairement les caract\u00e9ristiques de ce g\u00e9nie noir en particulier, et cela est encore plus vrai pour les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations successives.\nLa r\u00e9gression \u00e0 la moyenne dans le cas de m\u00e9tissage avec les Africains signifie la r\u00e9gression \u00e0 la moyenne africaine, avec des Asiatiques, la r\u00e9gression \u00e0 la moyenne asiatique. Ni l'un ni l'autre ne tient la promesse d'\u00e9lever le niveau de la moiti\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure ou de notre courbe en forme de cloche - c'est plut\u00f4t le contraire. Les autres races se sont m\u00e9lang\u00e9es avec les Europ\u00e9ens et partout, les r\u00e9sultats sont pour le moins peu impressionnants. Ils n'ont rien \u00e0 nous offrir.\nLa race europ\u00e9enne a toute la diversit\u00e9 dont elle a besoin pour sa sant\u00e9 et pour poursuivre son d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9volutif. C'est un crime moral et environnemental du plus grand ordre que de la d\u00e9truire en abolissant toutes ses d\u00e9fenses contre le m\u00e9tissage.\nLes Blancs devraient avoir le droit de remettre en place leurs barri\u00e8res traditionnelles contre l'accouplement et le contact social avec les non-Blancs afin de pr\u00e9server leur race. Ne pas le faire serait du g\u00e9nocide.\nEt notre race est menac\u00e9e. Nulle part notre taux de natalit\u00e9 est sup\u00e9rieur au taux de remplacement. Partout, nos fronti\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvertes et la nouvelle \u00e9lite enseigne \u00e0 nos enfants que les mariages interraciaux sont bons et d\u00e9sirables. Partout, la nouvelle \u00e9lite enseigne \u00e0 nos enfants que d\u00e9fendre notre patrimoine g\u00e9n\u00e9tique est la d\u00e9finition m\u00eame du mal.\nLe r\u00e9sultat final, si la tendance se maintient, sera le g\u00e9nocide. Le r\u00e9sultat final sera la mort d'un peuple singuli\u00e8rement beau, intelligent et cr\u00e9atif nomm\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9esse Europa.\nHR-1, onglet C-19\nCet article s'intitule [traduction] Les Indiens obtiennent un statut sp\u00e9cial et l'auteur est une certaine Michele Gagnon. \u00c0 l'audience, M.

Qui mettra fin au racisme?!\nLe Canada est rempli de personnes qui viennent de partout au monde, qui sont venues ici au fil du temps pour travailler fort et b\u00e2tir une nation forte. Des millions de gens ont d\u00fb faire face \u00e0 de grandes trag\u00e9dies, \u00e0 la mort et \u00e0 des temps difficiles, pourtant, ils ont TOUS r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 travailler en harmonie, \u00e0 cr\u00e9er de la richesse et \u00e0 payer le percepteur d'imp\u00f4ts pour maintenir les collectivit\u00e9s de notre nation. TOUS sauf les Indiens des Premi\u00e8res nations autochtones du Canada.\nBien que nous ayons fourni des sommes d'argent ahurissantes pour soutenir les collectivit\u00e9s et les individus de leur race, ils ne l'ont pas fait pour le reste des peuples du Canada. Quelques Indiens des Premi\u00e8res nations autochtones ont utilis\u00e9 leur \u00e9ducation universitaire gratuite (celle \u00e0 laquelle le reste d'entre nous n'a pas droit) pour obtenir des dipl\u00f4mes en droit et soutenir, encore une fois \u00e0 nos frais, que nous leur devons encore des milliards, que nos enfants leur doivent encore des milliards, et qu'ils veulent maintenant TOUTES les terres et les ressources.\nApparemment, seule cette race peut \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire du Canada et seule cette race n'a pas \u00e0 travailler ou \u00e0 payer des taxes pour d'autres races, et seule cette race peut pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des ressources de la terre et des cours d'eau et de l'argent qu'ils g\u00e9n\u00e8rent.

Nous les payons pour qu'ils nous bl\u00e2ment pour des choses que nous ne leur avons pas faites personnellement et, si nous n'acceptons pas le bl\u00e2me et la responsabilit\u00e9, NOUS sommes les racistes. Leur histoire est moins pire que celle de la plupart des peuples dont le territoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 colonis\u00e9 par de nouveaux arrivants, pourtant, ils nous escroquent comme si nous les avions personnellement massacr\u00e9s et comme si nous continuions \u00e0 le faire. Ce qui est encore plus troublant dans cela, c'est que nous sommes tomb\u00e9s dans le pi\u00e8ge et nous avons permis \u00e0 notre crainte du racisme de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer leur racisme.

Il faudrait sans doute le modifier ainsi : si tu hais ton ennemi comme on t'a enseign\u00e9 \u00e0 le percevoir, un jour, tu deviendras cet ennemi, comme tu croyais faussement qu'il \u00e9tait, et pas n\u00e9cessairement comme il est v\u00e9ritablement.\nLes Juifs, par leurs actes, ont prouv\u00e9 cet axiome. Ils ont non seulement \u00e9gal\u00e9 les exc\u00e8s attribu\u00e9s, par leur propre propagande, aux SS et \u00e0 la Gestapo, mais ils les ont surpass\u00e9s par leur traitement des Palestiniens et de leurs voisins arabes.\nPendant des mill\u00e9naires, les Juifs ont constitu\u00e9 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9litiste exclusive pr\u00e9sente partout dans le monde. Dans chaque pays o\u00f9 ils ont habit\u00e9, ils sont demeur\u00e9s, souvent pendant de nombreuses g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, s\u00e9par\u00e9s et \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart, des \u00e9trangers parmi les gens \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de qui ils habitaient.

Entre eux, ils ont acquis un quasi-monopole dans de nombreuses professions, un pouvoir et une richesse aucunement proportionnels \u00e0 leur nombre. LEUR communaut\u00e9 (la nation d'Isra\u00ebl) transcendait les fronti\u00e8res nationales et faisait trembler les gouvernements nationaux. Il faut souligner que la nation d'Isra\u00ebl englobe la totalit\u00e9 des Juifs du monde entier et pas seulement l'\u00c9tat d'Isra\u00ebl situ\u00e9 au Moyen-Orient.\nLe r\u00e9sultat \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable. Les peuples et les gouvernements, au cours de l'histoire, ont pris des mesures pour se prot\u00e9ger de ceux dont la loyaut\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas fiable et dont le pouvoir et la richesse constituaient une menace. Les Juifs ont appel\u00e9 cette r\u00e9action compr\u00e9hensible de l'oppression, de la discrimination et de l'antis\u00e9mitisme. Ils se sont d\u00e9crits comme opprim\u00e9s en m\u00eame temps qu'ils saignaient \u00e0 blanc les ressources financi\u00e8res de leurs bienfaiteurs.\nEn pr\u00e9textant une revendication territoriale vieille de deux mille ans, par des actes de terrorisme et de gu\u00e9rilla, ils ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la force l'\u00c9tat d'Isra\u00ebl.

Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier les passages suivants de l'article :\n[traduction]\nD\u00e8s le milieu des ann\u00e9es 60, le clan du nouvel ordre mondial, dont les membres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s \u00e0 des postes au gouvernement des \u00c9tats-Unis ou proches du gouvernement des \u00c9tats-Unis, avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9couvert Colin Powell, alors membre du Council on Foreign Relations et de la Commission trilat\u00e9rale. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9loquent. Il aimait la haute soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il suivait bien les ordres. Il ne faisait pas de vagues. Il ne provenait pas d'une acad\u00e9mie; il \u00e9tait Noir, du moins en apparence. Il n'avait rien fait de bien avant l'arm\u00e9e, n'ayant jamais pu vraiment s'int\u00e9grer ailleurs. Ses notes \u00e9taient \u00e0 peine dans la moyenne, ou plus faibles. N\u00e9 dans South Bronx, Powell n'avait aucun point de vue politique particulier (sauf sur la race, o\u00f9 il est aussi antiadamite que le Noir typique en politique) - n'avoir aucune opinion stable et in\u00e9branlable est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par les initi\u00e9s comme une qualit\u00e9 pour un homme de paille possible. Il pouvait donc \u00eatre entra\u00een\u00e9 - et utilis\u00e9.\nC'est alors que l'ascension fulgurante de Colin Powell \u00e0 la t\u00eate du Joint Chiefs of Staff am\u00e9ricain a commenc\u00e9, sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 un g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur le terrain, sans avoir re\u00e7u la formation militaire historique rigoureuse \u00e0 West Point ou \u00e0 une autre acad\u00e9mie militaire. D'autres g\u00e9n\u00e9raux beaucoup plus qualifi\u00e9s (blancs et chr\u00e9tiens bien s\u00fbr) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ignor\u00e9s comme des hors-d'uvre moisis sur un plateau \u00e0 une f\u00eate.\nC'est ce genre de personne (c'est-\u00e0-dire le pr\u00e9sident George Bush Ier) que la foule d'initi\u00e9s du nouvel ordre mondial adore. Dites-leur oui et faites-leur la r\u00e9v\u00e9rence et vous pouvez obtenir le monde.\nJe suis habitu\u00e9, tout comme vous, \u00e0 voir des animaux de compagnie noirs \u00eatre promus simplement parce qu'ils sont capables de se rendre devant une foule sans se faire vomir dessus. Mais ce que je n'aime pas \u00e0 propos de lui, c'est qu'il affiche fi\u00e8rement une menorah derri\u00e8re son bureau, parce que, dit-il, c'est un rappel constant pour lui de la souffrance et de la pers\u00e9cution que ces deux peuples ont subies. Mais il y a un peu plus que cette origine raciale, qui l'a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 filer en haut de l'\u00e9chelle des initi\u00e9s; en plus d'\u00eatre noir, il a un serpent dans ses anc\u00eatres, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de sa m\u00e8re en Jama\u00efque. Par cons\u00e9quent, la menorah repr\u00e9sente plus qu'un simple symbole de la pers\u00e9cution de la race noire et de la race juive; c'est sans aucun doute racial et possiblement religieux, parce que Powell a rejet\u00e9 la christianit\u00e9.\nAlors oui, Powell a subi un lavage de cerveau. Oui, il est un b\u00e9ni-oui-oui et un laquais pour les partisans d'un monde unique. Oui, il est une tapette de marionnette qui suivra la parade pour faire partie de la parade. Toutes ces caract\u00e9ristiques de Powell sont typiques de la classe des personnes nomm\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats-Unis; mais la menorah et le patrimoine cach\u00e9 font de lui seulement un autre serpent sournois.\nHR-1, onglet C-24\nCet article s'intitule [traduction] Paysans d\u00e9termin\u00e9s - un choix v\u00e9n\u00e9rable et a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par Carol on the Web. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier les extraits suivants :\n[traduction]\nJ'ai ma carte de membre de cette caste banlieusarde post-d\u00e9pressionaire connue sous le nom de boomers, dont la mobilit\u00e9 est ascendante, mais la culture descendante. Nous avons v\u00e9cu avec plus de choix que de bon sens. Et notre mobilit\u00e9 n'a pas toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 vers le haut ou vers l'int\u00e9rieur - seulement vers l'ext\u00e9rieur. Trop d'entre nous sommes perdus dans une mer de choix de valeurs - un pr\u00e9texte malicieux des m\u00e9dias juifs.\nMais pas avant que je partage un r\u00e9cent exemple de no 5 - \u00c9crivez des lettres aux journaux et aux magazines. Charles Krauthammer du Washington Post aborde le nouvel antis\u00e9mitisme en disant :\nCette fois, cependant, la haine des Juifs est plus sophistiqu\u00e9e. Ce n'est pas une haine sans nuance des Juifs. Ils peuvent \u00eatre tol\u00e9r\u00e9s, m\u00eame accept\u00e9s, mais ils doivent rester \u00e0 leur place. Les Juifs sont acceptables dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils sont impuissants, passifs et pittoresques. Ce qui est intol\u00e9rable est l'assurance des Juifs, leur refus d'accepter d'\u00eatre victimis\u00e9s. Et rien ne repr\u00e9sente cela plus que l'\u00c9tat juif.\nCette affirmation est effront\u00e9ment hypocrite. C'est \u00e9galement une moquerie des gens au grand cur qui ont accueilli des Juifs \u00e0 des postes haut plac\u00e9s de pouvoir dans la culture, les affaires et le gouvernement. Les Juifs sont certainement puissants et agressifs - s'ils ne sont pas pittoresques. C'est NOUS, les non-Juifs, qui devons tol\u00e9rer le Juif-en-tant-que-victime, dans toutes ses manifestations profitables. Krauthammer continue :\nCe qui offense tellement les Europ\u00e9ens est le Juif arm\u00e9, le Juif qui refuse de subir sept attentats suicide \u00e0 la bombe dans les sept jours de P\u00e2que et qui r\u00e9plique. Ce Juif \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9monis\u00e9 dans la presse europ\u00e9enne comme jamais depuis, bien... depuis les ann\u00e9es 30. Le quotidien lib\u00e9ral italien La Stampa a publi\u00e9 une caricature de l'enfant J\u00e9sus, assi\u00e9g\u00e9 par des chars d'assaut isra\u00e9liens, qui dit : Ne me dites pas qu'ils veulent me tuer une autre fois.\nLes caricatures italiennes ne sont pas pires que les piques antiarabes de la presse juive\/am\u00e9ricaine. La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 est que les chars d'assaut juifs rasent des villages entiers \u00e0 la poursuite de soldats de la R\u00e9sistance. Les Juifs d\u00e9racinent d'anciens oliviers pour se d\u00e9barrasser des r\u00e9coltes palestiniennes. Les soldats juifs d\u00e9f\u00e8quent sur les planchers de salles d'urgence apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9truit l'\u00e9quipement m\u00e9dical des h\u00f4pitaux non juifs. Et c'est la presse, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8re des Juifs, qui est obs\u00e9d\u00e9e par les p\u00e9dophiles catholiques, au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 ils ne prennent pas en compte le nombre croissant de crimes sexuels commis par des rabbins (noms non reproduits) pour n'en nommer que quelques-uns - les lecteurs int\u00e9ress\u00e9s devraient lire l'article en entier de ce lien. C'est long, mais EXTR\u00caMEMENT instructif sur les rabbins pr\u00e9dateurs sexuels. Krauthammer poursuit :\nEncore. Et cette fois, les tueurs de Christ arrivent en char d'assaut. Juste au moment o\u00f9 l'Europe s'\u00e9tait r\u00e9concili\u00e9e avec la tol\u00e9rance pour le Juif passif - le survivant de l'Holocauste qu'on pouvait prendre en piti\u00e9, \u00e9lev\u00e9 au rang de star, et \u00e0 qui on pouvait accorder un prix litt\u00e9raire occasionnel - s'am\u00e8ne l'\u00c9tat juif, grossier et essentiel et, par-dessus tout, refusant de demander pardon pour sa propre existence.\nSe r\u00e9concilier avec sa tol\u00e9rance pour le Juif passif? Il y a des Juifs passifs? Et le prix litt\u00e9raire occasionnel? Charles se met lui-m\u00eame dans l'embarras \u00e0 ce moment, mais il ne semble pas entendre les bruits qui courent partout autour du monde. LA TERRE \u00c0 CHARLES : les Juifs accordent des prix aux Juifs qui accordent des prix aux Juifs pour n'importe quoi d'exemplaire. Mais il a raison sur un point. L'\u00c9tat juif est GROSSIER, mais essentiel \u00e0 personne, sauf \u00e0 d'autres Juifs. En conclusion, Charles lance une autre bombe puante aux Europ\u00e9ens, cette fois, aux redoutables Fran\u00e7ais :\nPour ceux d'entre nous qui croient que les Juifs ont beaucoup trop de pouvoir sur tout ce qui touche \u00e0 nos vies... je demande QUI D'AUTRE se qualifie?\nEn Am\u00e9rique, les Juifs sont totalement hors de contr\u00f4le dans la politique, la publication, les universit\u00e9s, les m\u00e9dias, le droit et la m\u00e9decine ... dois-je poursuivre?\n\u00c7a suffit - les sentiments antijuifs sont le produit de la domination juive combin\u00e9e \u00e0 la frustration d'\u00eatre trait\u00e9s de bigots et de personnes haineuses si nous nous plaignons. L'antis\u00e9mitisme traditionnel est \u00e0 propos de ce que les Juifs FONT pour obtenir et d\u00e9fendre le pouvoir disproportionn\u00e9 qu'ils exercent sur les populations qu'ils exploitent. C'est une question de pouvoir, de son utilisation bonne ou mauvaise - et NON une question de religion - \u00e0 moins que le pouvoir SOIT leur religion.\nHR-1, onglet C-25\nCet article s'intitule [traduction] R\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour vivre avec d'autres personnes. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier les passages suivants :\n[traduction]\nParmi les bons exemples d'ennemis que les nationalistes blancs rencontrent se trouvent souvent les antiracistes - qu'ils soient communistes, lib\u00e9raux ou chr\u00e9tiens (ou les trois), membres de groupes juifs, membres de la police, membres des m\u00e9dias, agents d'un tribunal, ou autre chose du genre. Ces personnes ne veulent aucun mal aux nationalistes blancs; si vous les traitez en amis, ils vous utiliseront jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils voient un avantage \u00e0 se d\u00e9barrasser de vous. Les nationalistes blancs comptent parmi leurs amis presque tout le reste du monde et certaines des personnes nomm\u00e9es ci-dessus lorsqu'elles n'agissent pas dans le cadre de leurs fonctions officielles.\n2) Vous avez des obligations morales envers vos amis; vous n'avez aucune obligation morale envers vos ennemis.\nLes Juifs corrompent activement les organisations nationalistes blanches en ayant recours \u00e0 des informateurs, \u00e0 de fausses arrestations, en r\u00e9pandant des mensonges \u00e0 propos de la nature et de l'intention de l'organisation, en publiant de fausses nouvelles, en faisant constamment de la propagande, en commettant des actes de harc\u00e8lement criminel, en commettant des actes criminels de violence et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en utilisant tous les moyens \u00e0 leur disposition.

Maintenant, des ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s sa mort, je suis enfin parvenu \u00e0 accepter mon h\u00e9ritage sans honte et sans excuses, et j'ai finalement compris la tromperie monstrueuse inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 mon p\u00e8re, \u00e0 notre famille et \u00e0 notre nation de Gentils qui \u00e9tait jadis belle et blanche.\nVoici quelle \u00e9tait l'Am\u00e9rique quand mon p\u00e8re, avec 15 millions d'autres soldats am\u00e9ricains presque tous blancs, est parti combattre les Nazis, dans une guerre qui a tu\u00e9 405 399 soldats et en a bless\u00e9 671 278 :\nune politique d'immigration n'acceptant que les Blancs; une politique de naturalisation n'acceptant que les Blancs; la loi permettait seulement aux Blancs et aux Noirs n\u00e9s en Am\u00e9rique de voter, tandis que les exigences en mati\u00e8re de lecture et d'\u00e9criture et la discrimination emp\u00eachaient en fait la plupart des Noirs de voter (les Africains en Afrique ne pouvaient pas voter non plus); les Chinois, les Hispaniques ou d'autres non-Blancs n\u00e9s en Am\u00e9rique n'avaient pas le droit de vote (les Chinois en Chine et les Hispaniques vivant dans de nombreuses nations de l'Am\u00e9rique latine n'avaient pas le droit de vote non plus; d'ailleurs, les femmes mexicaines n'ont pas vot\u00e9 au Mexique avant 1953); il y avait de la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation dans les \u00e9coles; les mariages interraciaux \u00e9taient interdits par la loi; des zones r\u00e9sidentielles \u00e9taient r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux Blancs; la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation \u00e9tait appliqu\u00e9e dans l'arm\u00e9e, les transports, les h\u00f4tels, les restaurants, les salles de bain, les fontaines \u00e0 eau potable, etc.; les non-Blancs ne pouvaient pas devenir policier; la pri\u00e8re \u00e9tait obligatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole; nous professions publiquement \u00eatre une nation chr\u00e9tienne; l'antis\u00e9mitisme \u00e9tait direct et socialement acceptable; le pr\u00e9sident Eisenhower, notre c\u00e9l\u00e8bre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui avait combattu les Nazis, \u00e9tait le m\u00eame homme qui a plus tard autoris\u00e9 l'arm\u00e9e \u00e0 mettre en uvre l'op\u00e9ration Wetback en 1954 dans laquelle des Mexicains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ramass\u00e9s et renvoy\u00e9s au Mexique.\nAujourd'hui, quiconque oserait sugg\u00e9rer un retour \u00e0 ces politiques draconiennes serait trait\u00e9 de nazi. La question se soul\u00e8ve : si l'Am\u00e9rique qui mettait en uvre ces politiques n'\u00e9tait pas diff\u00e9rente des Nazis qu'elle combattait, alors pourquoi diable les avons-nous combattus? Pourquoi avons-nous essay\u00e9 de d\u00e9truire un peuple qui \u00e9tait essentiellement comme le n\u00f4tre? Avec le recul, il semble que nous ayons fait une erreur fatale en d\u00e9truisant nos semblables dans le but de sauver un peuple tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9tranger qui, par gratitude envers leurs sauveurs gentils \u00e9tourdis, sont maintenant en train de nous faire ce qu'ils ont fait aux Allemands.\nLorsque vous examinez les objectifs des Nazis, tr\u00e8s peu d'Am\u00e9ricains se seraient offusqu\u00e9s de la vaste majorit\u00e9 d'entre eux.

Cette foi, qui a jadis \u00e9t\u00e9 la pierre d'assise de la civilisation occidentale, est devenue une source de culpabilit\u00e9 et d'autoflagellation typique du lib\u00e9ralisme. Aujourd'hui, l'expression publique de la christianit\u00e9 diff\u00e8re seulement par des d\u00e9tails du marxisme dans ses attitudes envers la redistribution \u00e9conomique, l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 et l'int\u00e9gration raciale.\nComment la christianit\u00e9 a-t-elle pu tomber si bas - et emporter notre peuple avec elle? La r\u00e9ponse est qu'elle a corrompu l'altruisme inn\u00e9 qui aidait les familles et les tribus \u00e0 survivre et a transform\u00e9 cette caract\u00e9ristique en agent de passivit\u00e9 et de reddition. La christianit\u00e9 a universalis\u00e9 l'altruisme, ce qui nous a d\u00e9pouill\u00e9s de nos moyens de d\u00e9fense contre le multiculturalisme.

Et les cons\u00e9quences de leurs actions se font sentir aujourd'hui.\nLe divorce de la christianit\u00e9 d'avec la conscience raciale est \u00e0 la fois soudain et r\u00e9cent. Ce n'est qu'au 20e si\u00e8cle que les humanistes la\u00efques ont infiltr\u00e9 presque toutes les principales organisations chr\u00e9tiennes. D\u00e8s les ann\u00e9es 1960, la christianit\u00e9 organis\u00e9e travaillait main dans la main avec le juda\u00efsme organis\u00e9 pour abattre le mur de hi\u00e9rarchie raciale que le Sud avait \u00e9rig\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'autoprotection.

Le fondateur de la Coalition chr\u00e9tienne, Pat Robertson, est en faveur de l'augmentation de l'immigration provenant du sud de la fronti\u00e8re parce que les nouveaux arrivants sont principalement chr\u00e9tiens, d\u00e9fendent les valeurs familiales et sont notre sorte d'\u00e9lecteurs.\nAvec des ministres du culte qui pr\u00eachent le suicide racial, la christianit\u00e9 peut aujourd'hui repr\u00e9senter une plus grande menace \u00e0 notre survie que le lib\u00e9ralisme.\nLes d\u00e9fauts de la christianit\u00e9 ne nous ont pas menac\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la technologie et l'id\u00e9ologie fassent sentir leurs cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle mondiale. Aujourd'hui notre code moral doit renoncer \u00e0 l'universalisme et insister sur notre propre survie. \u00c0 moins que nous adoptions des croyances morales qui tiennent compte de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 d\u00e9mographique actuelle, nous ne survivrons pas \u00e0 la vague montante de l'immigration du Tiers Monde, de la procr\u00e9ation et du m\u00e9tissage. C'est dans ce sens que, comme l'a dit Jean Raspail, la charit\u00e9 chr\u00e9tienne se r\u00e9v\u00e8lera impuissante, la charit\u00e9 chr\u00e9tienne peut difficilement mettre fin \u00e0 un d\u00e9placement d\u00e9mographique qu'elle a mis en branle.\nHR-1, onglet C-31\nCet article s'intitule : [traduction] Est-ce qu'un culte satanique domine le monde? Il est \u00e9crit par Henry Makow. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Warman a vers\u00e9 au dossier les passages suivants :\n[traduction]\nQui sont les Illuminati? Nous vivons encore sous les derniers rayons de la civilisation occidentale, laquelle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la christianit\u00e9. La civilisation a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur une religion, un id\u00e9al. Le Christ a enseign\u00e9 que Dieu est immanent et son plan est de se manifester \u00e0 travers sa cr\u00e9ation. Nous devons accomplir ses volont\u00e9s plut\u00f4t que de satisfaire nos propres d\u00e9sirs \u00e9go\u00efstes. Les rois tenaient leur pouvoir de Dieu et devaient lui en rendre compte.\nLes Pharisiens juifs on rejet\u00e9 le Christ. Ils pratiquaient une religion naturaliste qui a mis le message du Christ \u00e0 l'envers.\nLa franc-ma\u00e7onnerie est enseign\u00e9e \u00e0 vos enfants. Par exemple, un sondage aupr\u00e8s des \u00e9coles dans ma ville r\u00e9v\u00e8le que 75 % d'entre elles n'utilisent plus le mot No\u00ebl pour d\u00e9crire les f\u00eates d'hiver. \u00c0 la place, No\u00ebl a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par du jargon comme concerts d'hiver et c\u00e9l\u00e9bration internationale des f\u00eates.\nL'arbre de No\u00ebl du Parlement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renomm\u00e9 arbre multiculturel jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'une temp\u00eate de protestations force les politiciens \u00e0 changer d'avis.\nNous devons abandonner notre culture afin de respecter celle des autres? C'est un peu b\u00eate, comme s'est plaint un des parents.\nMais c'est justement cela l'objectif : d\u00e9truire la christianit\u00e9, comme ils ont d\u00e9truit des empires, des nations, l'identit\u00e9 h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuelle et les cellules familiales. L'objectif est de nous d\u00e9pouiller de notre pouvoir et de notre identit\u00e9, ce qui nous laissera sans d\u00e9fense face \u00e0 la tyrannie d'un monde unique.\nHR-1, onglet C-32\nCet article s'intitule [traduction] Les Noirs g\u00e2t\u00e9s : nous n'osons pas en parler et est \u00e9crit par Robert Rocher. \u00c0 l'audience, M.

Et ce quelqu'un dont je parle inclus ceux qui se font passer pour nos leaders religieux.\nSoit dit entre parenth\u00e8ses, si un groupe a besoin d'un mouvement de lib\u00e9ration de la femme, ce sont les femmes noires. Des types noirs calleux psychopathes les utilisent sans vergogne, les engrossent, les abandonnent avec les enfants, puis en rient. Certains d'entre eux, les types cools de la rue, reviennent m\u00eame plus tard pour vendre de la drogue aux enfants qu'ils ont con\u00e7us. Les femmes noires devraient se lever et tout bonnement massacrer la moiti\u00e9 des hommes noirs du pays sans piti\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il ne reste aucune trace de la musique gangsta rap dans le monde. Jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elles le fassent, il y aura peu d'avenir pour la race noire.

R\u00c9PARATIONS\nV. ORDONNANCE\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Mme Dawson est une personne autiste. Le 9 ao\u00fbt 2002, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, contre l'intim\u00e9e. Il s'agit de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte que Mme Dawson a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l'intim\u00e9e. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re plainte, le dossier d\u00e9montre que l'intim\u00e9e et la plaignante en \u00e9taient arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 une entente le 16 ao\u00fbt 2001. Le dossier d\u00e9montre aussi que la mise en application de cette entente a caus\u00e9 beaucoup d'irritation \u00e0 Mme Dawson, qui \u00e9tait d'avis que l'intim\u00e9e ne respectait pas l'entente et m\u00eame qu'elle la violait.\n[2] Dans sa plainte du 9 ao\u00fbt 2002, Mme Dawson soutient que l'intim\u00e9e a fait preuve envers elle de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience, en contravention \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, parce que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas pris des mesures d'accommodement pour la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Dawson (l'autisme). Mme Dawson soutient aussi que l'intim\u00e9e a fait preuve envers elle de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience, en contravention \u00e0 l'article 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Finalement, Mme Dawson soutient que l'intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle parce qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, repr\u00e9sailles qui contreviennent \u00e0 l'article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[3] L'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00e9nonce que [c]onstitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de [...] d\u00e9favoriser [un individu] en cours d'emploi. L'alin\u00e9a 14c) de la Loi \u00e9nonce que [c]onstitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Quant \u00e0 l'article 14.1 de la Loi, il pr\u00e9voit que [c]onstitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d'exercer ou de menacer d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e. En ce qui a trait aux motifs de distinction illicite, ils sont d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi comme \u00e9tant ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n[4] \u00c0 l'audience, Mme Dawson s'est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame sans l'aide d'un avocat. La Commission \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, tout comme l'intim\u00e9e.\n[5] Il convient de noter tout d'abord que la plaignante, dans ses observations finales ainsi que tout au long de l'audience, a beaucoup critiqu\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont le Tribunal avait trait\u00e9 ses demandes d'accommodement en cours d'audience. La plaignante \u00e9tait d'avis que le Tribunal \u00e9tait plus dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 faire preuve d'accommodement pour les besoins de personnes qui n'\u00e9taient pas autistes qu'\u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins \u00e0 elle.\n[6] Par exemple, Mme Dawson n'a cess\u00e9 de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter au d\u00e9but de l'audience que celle-ci n'\u00e9tait pas accessible aux personnes autistes comme elle. Elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'on ne lui a pas donn\u00e9 les renseignements ni les r\u00e9ponses dont elle avait besoin. Elle a aussi fait valoir que le type d'horaire qu'on lui a impos\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire de longues p\u00e9riodes de repas, de longues heures, ne respectait pas ses besoins, que ce dont elle avait besoin \u00e9tait d'une journ\u00e9e rapide tr\u00e8s concentr\u00e9e avec de courtes pauses et aucun repas. \u00c0 ce sujet, Mme Dawson a reconnu qu'elle avait des probl\u00e8mes logistiques assez importants. Mme Dawson a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Commission avait agi de fa\u00e7on largement accusatoire en l'esp\u00e8ce, et qu'en fait, elle n'avait pas eu la collaboration de la Commission.\n[7] Le Tribunal ne pr\u00e9sentera aucune justification judiciaire pour les d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en ce qui a trait au d\u00e9roulement de l'audience et il laissera le dossier servir d'explication. Cela dit, dans ses observations finales, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l'identit\u00e9 de ses m\u00e9decins traitants reste confidentielle afin de prot\u00e9ger sa propre vie priv\u00e9e. Le Tribunal ne voit aucun pr\u00e9judice envers les autres parties au fait de ne pas mentionner le nom des m\u00e9decins traitants de Mme Dawson ou le nom du psychologue qui a \u00e9tabli le diagnostic de son \u00e9tat.\nII. CONSID\u00c9RATIONS PR\u00c9LIMINAIRES [8] Avant d'analyser les questions de fond soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte, un certain nombre de questions pr\u00e9liminaires doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es. Il s'agit de : A. les \u00e9v\u00e9nements pass\u00e9s; B. la carri\u00e8re de Mme Dawson \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes; C. l'\u00e9tat m\u00e9dical de Mme Dawson.\nA. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements pass\u00e9s [9] Le Tribunal est d'avis qu'afin de comprendre les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, il est important de tenir compte des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Le Tribunal tient compte du fait que ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s dans la premi\u00e8re plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Dawson, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'une entente entre les parties. Bien que ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements ne fassent pas partie de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, on y a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence et on en a discut\u00e9 tout au long de l'audience. Ils fournissent un contexte \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Cependant, ils ne peuvent absolument pas \u00eatre d\u00e9terminants quant aux conclusions qui sont tir\u00e9es au sujet des \u00e9v\u00e9nements vis\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente plainte, \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont eu lieu entre septembre 2001 et juin 2002. Le Tribunal examinera d'abord le Rapport Cantin et ensuite, l'entente de 2001.\n[10] Mme Dawson et Mme Daoust, un t\u00e9moin qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements. De novembre 1998 \u00e0 novembre 2002, Mme Daoust \u00e9tait gestionnaire en sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et elle \u00e9tait responsable de la gestion des accidents de travail ainsi que de la pr\u00e9vention de tels accidents.\n(i) Le Rapport Cantin [11] Pendant l'audience, Mme Daoust a expliqu\u00e9 au Tribunal \u00e0 quel moment et de quelle fa\u00e7on elle a particip\u00e9 au dossier de Mme Dawson. \u00c0 ce sujet, elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en juillet 1999, elle a re\u00e7u un appel de l'un des superviseurs de Mme Dawson, M. Schetagne, qui l'avisait que certains des employ\u00e9s de la succursale postale de Pierrefonds (qui ne faisaient pas partie de la gestion) \u00e9taient all\u00e9s voir les gestionnaires et leurs avaient mentionn\u00e9 leurs pr\u00e9occupations au sujet d'une employ\u00e9e qu'ils avaient vue entrer au travail avec des blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es et leur crainte qu'un jour ils soient bless\u00e9s par cette personne. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, ces employ\u00e9s se demandaient si cette personne repr\u00e9sentait un danger pour leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9. M. Schetagne a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Daoust d'envoyer quelqu'un \u00e0 la succursale postale de Pierrefonds qui pourrait parler aux employ\u00e9s et r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leurs inqui\u00e9tudes. Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 surprise et choqu\u00e9e de savoir que ses coll\u00e8gues avaient pens\u00e9 qu'elle pouvait devenir violente et qu'elle pouvait poser un danger pour leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[12] Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle a alors envoy\u00e9 Mme Johanne Cantin, qui \u00e9tait la directrice du Programme d'aide aux employ\u00e9s (PAE), \u00e0 la succursale postale de Pierrefonds pour rencontrer les employ\u00e9s. Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsqu'elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cantin de se rendre \u00e0 la succursale postale, c'\u00e9tait dans le but de rassurer les employ\u00e9s et non d'effectuer une enqu\u00eate au sujet de Mme Dawson. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, Mme Cantin a rencontr\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s, a \u00e9crit un rapport et lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ce rapport en juillet 1999.\n[13] Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de mentionner en l'esp\u00e8ce le contenu exact du rapport, mais il convient de pr\u00e9ciser que le rapport contenait les observations et les recommandations de Mme Cantin, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain nombre de personnes \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et que Mme Dawson n'a eu connaissance de l'existence du rapport qu'\u00e0 la fin 2000. Mme Dawson a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le fait qu'autant de personnes \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avaient obtenu une copie du rapport avait eu des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur leur opinion \u00e0 son sujet.\n[14] Mme Daoust a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu'elle a envoy\u00e9 Mme Cantin \u00e0 la succursale postale de Pierrefonds pour enqu\u00eater, elle ne savait pas qui Mme Dawson \u00e9tait ni que Mme Cantin avait une relation professionnelle avec Mme Dawson. La preuve d\u00e9montre que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a un contrat avec un organisme externe qui fournit les services du PAE et que c'est cet organisme qui d\u00e9cide qui sera la personne qui r\u00e9pondra \u00e0 toute demande de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a d\u00e9couvert la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Dawson apr\u00e8s l'enqu\u00eate de Mme Cantin.\n[15] La preuve d\u00e9montre que le Rapport Cantin a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Medisys, une firme qui s'occupe des questions m\u00e9dicales de l'intim\u00e9e et qu'il s'est aussi retrouv\u00e9 dans le dossier administratif de Mme Dawson \u00e0 la succursale postale de Pierrefonds. En raison du contenu du rapport de Mme Cantin, Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait d'avis qu'un suivi devait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 pour cette question. La d\u00e9cision a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 prise d'envoyer une infirmi\u00e8re de Medisys, Madeleine Dufour, au lieu de travail de Mme Dawson afin de rassurer les employ\u00e9s de la succursale postale. Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'on ne l'a jamais avis\u00e9e de cette mesure. Mme Daoust a soutenu que le syndicat a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 ainsi que le chef d'unit\u00e9 de Mme Dawson.\n[16] Les mesures additionnelles que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a prises ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que Mme Dawson ne repr\u00e9sentait aucun danger pour ses coll\u00e8gues et qu'elle ne s'\u00e9tait jamais inflig\u00e9 de blessures devant ses coll\u00e8gues. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que toutes les personnes qui ont re\u00e7u une copie du Rapport Cantin ont re\u00e7u la directive de ne pas en tenir compte.\n[17] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 de nombreuses fois qu'elle avait per\u00e7u l'initiative d'envoyer Mme Cantin \u00e0 la succursale postale de Pierrefonds comme une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 son sujet apr\u00e8s que des all\u00e9gations s\u00e9rieuses aient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par des coll\u00e8gues au sujet de son comportement violent.\n[18] Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsque Mme Dawson a eu connaissance de l'existence du Rapport Cantin, en novembre 2000, elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s en col\u00e8re de savoir qu'une telle enqu\u00eate avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e sans qu'elle ne le sache. Elle ne comprenait pas pourquoi une telle enqu\u00eate avait eu lieu et elle ne comprenait pas pourquoi les renseignements contenus dans le rapport avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s au sein de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes.\n[19] Pendant son contre-interrogatoire, Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que tout de suite apr\u00e8s d\u00e9cembre 2000, Mme Dawson lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 de trois \u00e0 cinq fois, peut-\u00eatre quatre. Cependant, elle \u00e9tait incapable de fournir des dates. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, les appels portaient sur le Rapport Cantin. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, pendant le premier appel, Mme Dawson s'est plainte du contenu du rapport. Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Dawson ne lui avait jamais mentionn\u00e9 que Mme Cantin \u00e9tait sa psychologue. Mme Daoust se souvient que Mme Dawson lui a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de retirer la lettre de son dossier et d'aviser ses coll\u00e8gues que le contenu du rapport \u00e9tait faux. Mme Daoust a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au cours d'une des conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques portant sur le Rapport Cantin, elles ont eu une discussion au sujet de ce que Mme Daoust ferait si elle apprenait que quelqu'un \u00e0 la succursale postale poss\u00e9dait un fusil.\n[20] Le dossier d\u00e9montre qu'apr\u00e8s que Mme Dawson a d\u00e9couvert l'existence du Rapport Cantin, Mme Daoust a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 deux lettres d'excuses.\n[21] La premi\u00e8re lettre, dat\u00e9e du 18 janvier 2001, porte sur le rapport produit par Mme Cantin, la coordonnatrice du PAE de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, en juillet 1999. Le dossier d\u00e9montre que cette \u00e9bauche de lettre ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux attentes de Mme Dawson. Dans la lettre, Mme Daoust reconna\u00eet que le rapport s'\u00e9tait retrouv\u00e9 dans le dossier personnel de Mme Dawson, o\u00f9 il n'aurait jamais d\u00fb \u00eatre plac\u00e9, que le rapport n'\u00e9tait pas de nature disciplinaire mais \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des observations de Mme Cantin et des faits qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9s par certains des employ\u00e9s de la succursale postale de Pierrefonds. Mme Daoust a aussi \u00e9crit dans la lettre que le rapport avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour que la gestion comprenne mieux la situation et aide \u00e0 informer les coll\u00e8gues ad\u00e9quatement, au besoin, et elle a assur\u00e9 Mme Dawson que le rapport serait d\u00e9truit imm\u00e9diatement. Finalement, Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, au moment o\u00f9 le rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9, Mme Cantin avait fait un rapport verbal plus complet et avait avis\u00e9 la gestion de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes que personne travaillant dans la m\u00eame zone de travail que Mme Dawson ne devrait s'inqui\u00e9ter de sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail.\n[22] La deuxi\u00e8me lettre, qui est dat\u00e9e du 4 juin 2001 et qui a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par Mme Dawson, porte sur une r\u00e9union qui a eu lieu le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2001 avec Mme Dawson. La lettre explique qu'aucune plainte n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au sujet de son travail et que son travail \u00e9tait exemplaire, qu'elle n'avait pas eu un certain type de comportement, qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas dangereuse envers d'autres personnes et qu'elle n'attaquerait jamais physiquement quelqu'un.\n(ii) L'entente de 2001 [23] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que la premi\u00e8re plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante contre l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e le 16 ao\u00fbt 2001. La premi\u00e8re plainte portait sur le Rapport Cantin. Selon les conditions de l'entente, l'intim\u00e9e a accept\u00e9 de payer un certain montant d'argent \u00e0 un organisme de bienfaisance et de s'excuser aupr\u00e8s de Mme Dawson.\n[24] Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a souvent fait allusion aux probl\u00e8mes auxquels elle a fait face en ce qui a trait au respect de l'entente convenue pour la premi\u00e8re plainte et \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par Mme Huguette Demers, directrice des Ressources humaines de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes pour la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le retard dans le paiement du montant pr\u00e9vu dans l'entente est devenu tr\u00e8s frustrant pour Mme Dawson. Ce qui semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement frustrant pour Mme Dawson est le fait que Mme Demers lui a dit que le paiement du montant pr\u00e9vu dans l'entente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, alors que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas.\n[25] La preuve d\u00e9montre que Mme Dawson a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable d'expliquer l'entente \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues au cours d'une r\u00e9union d'\u00e9tage de cinq minutes le 6 septembre 2001. Mme Dawson a not\u00e9 que la r\u00e9union a eu lieu apr\u00e8s la diffusion, en f\u00e9vrier 2001, d'un documentaire \u00e0 Radio-Canada dans lequel elle apparaissait. D'apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, 100 personnes se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Lors de cette r\u00e9union, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait autiste, elle a inform\u00e9 les gens pr\u00e9sents de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui venait tout juste d'\u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e et elle a parl\u00e9 un peu de la formation en droits de la personne effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. De fa\u00e7on plus pr\u00e9cise, Mme Dawson a not\u00e9 que la discrimination envers les autistes n'est pas caus\u00e9e par les autistes, que le probl\u00e8me n'est pas l'autisme et qu'il n'existe pas un ensemble de droits pour les personnes qui sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es folles et un autre ensemble pour le reste de la population.\n[26] Quant \u00e0 elle, Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en 2001, apr\u00e8s le r\u00e8glement de la premi\u00e8re plainte, des r\u00e9unions ont eu lieu avec Mme Dawson. Mme Daoust \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 deux de ces r\u00e9unions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues \u00e0 la succursale postale de Pierrefonds.\n[27] Le dossier d\u00e9montre qu'une r\u00e9union a eu lieu le 21 septembre 2001. Richard Paradis, Danielle Daoust, Jacques Th\u00e9roux, Christian Potvin et Michel Couture \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 un certain moment pendant la r\u00e9union, Mme Dawson a dit \u00e0 Richard Paradis de se taire et qu'il n'avait pas le droit de parler. Cependant, Mme Daoust a reconnu qu'elle ne se souvenait pas des mots exacts qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s. Mme Daoust a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvenait pas de l'objet de la r\u00e9union ni de la personne qui l'avait organis\u00e9e.\n[28] N\u00e9anmoins, Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'au cours de la r\u00e9union, on avait discut\u00e9 du contenu des deux lettres d'excuses susmentionn\u00e9es. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait Mme Dawson qui avait demand\u00e9 que la lettre contienne une d\u00e9claration au sujet du fait qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas violente. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait besoin que cela soit \u00e9crit afin de garantir sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, il semble que Mme Daoust ne voulait pas reconna\u00eetre que sa deuxi\u00e8me lettre \u00e9tait mal formul\u00e9e, en particulier l'endroit o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en conclusion, [traduction] la gestion et vos coll\u00e8gues savent maintenant que bien que vous souffrez d'autisme, votre \u00e9tat ne repr\u00e9sente aucun danger \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des autres. Mme Dawson a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au cours de la r\u00e9union, on lui a dit que si elle avait des inqui\u00e9tudes \u00e0 propos de quoi que ce soit, elle devait parler \u00e0 Richard Paradis.\n[29] Il convient de noter que Mme Boucher, gestionnaire des droits de la personne \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, l'une des deux t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que c'est dans le contexte de l'application de l'entente pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la suite de la premi\u00e8re plainte qu'une personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9e pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions de Mme Dawson et que cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise afin de r\u00e9duire au minimum le nombre de personnes qui devaient traiter avec elle. D'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Boucher, cette personne a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 Richard Paradis, puis il a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par Huguette Demers. Il semble que cela ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait afin de mieux comprendre Mme Dawson et de mieux r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses questions.\n[30] Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s le r\u00e8glement de la premi\u00e8re plainte, elle a re\u00e7u des appels de la part de Mme Dawson qui \u00e9tait toujours pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par l'entente. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, toutes les conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques ont dur\u00e9 entre 30 \u00e0 45 minutes. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que la raison pour laquelle Mme Dawson lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phonait \u00e9tait qu'elle avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 ses patrons et qu'ils n'avaient pas retourn\u00e9 ses appels. Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que pendant les appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, Mme Dawson levait parfois la voix, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'elle n'obtenait pas la r\u00e9ponse qu'elle voulait, mais qu'elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 insultante.\n[31] Le dossier d\u00e9montre qu'il a fallu quelques mois de plus pour r\u00e9soudre compl\u00e8tement la question de l'entente. En fait, cette question n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue qu'en d\u00e9cembre 2001.\n[32] Il convient de noter que pendant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s juillet 1999, elle a re\u00e7u beaucoup d'appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de la part de Mme Dawson. Elle a reconnu qu'elle n'avait jamais pris note de ces conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, ces conversations, qui avaient lieu \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e, duraient tr\u00e8s longtemps, entre une demi-heure et une heure. Cependant, Mme Daoust a reconnu que certaines des conversations \u00e9taient plus courtes, mais que la plupart duraient probablement 30 minutes ou plus.\n[33] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, Mme Dawson parlait sans s'arr\u00eater et, parfois, elle se f\u00e2chait. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas la seule qui recevait des appels de Mme Dawson. D'autres employ\u00e9s, tels que Carman Lapointe-Young, Raymond Poirier, Huguette Demers, Richard Paradis et Louise Lefebvre, ont tous v\u00e9cu ce type de situation, qui n'\u00e9tait pas toujours facile \u00e0 g\u00e9rer. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, les personnes \u00e0 qui Mme Dawson t\u00e9l\u00e9phonait devaient lui raccrocher au nez afin de mettre fin \u00e0 la conversation.\n[34] En ce qui a trait aux appels, Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait pas se souvenir \u00e0 quel moment Mme Dawson a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler \u00e0 Mme Traversy, gestionnaire, Relations du travail, ni combien de fois elle lui a parl\u00e9. Cependant, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de se souvenir que Mme Traversy lui avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 et lui avait dit que Mme Dawson l'avait appel\u00e9e et que ses questions devaient \u00eatre trait\u00e9es au niveau local et non au niveau national. Le dossier d\u00e9montre que Mme Traversy s'est occup\u00e9e du dossier de Mme Dawson au cours du r\u00e8glement de la premi\u00e8re plainte, qui a eu lieu en ao\u00fbt 2001.\n[35] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, Mme Dawson lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 parce qu'elle craignait de perdre son emploi \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait venue travailler alors qu'elle \u00e9tait bless\u00e9e et parce qu'elle avait peur d'\u00eatre vue comme une mauvaise employ\u00e9e. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, ces conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques auraient eu lieu au moment o\u00f9 la restructuration de la succursale postale de Pierrefonds a eu lieu. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, cette restructuration a eu lieu en avril 1999 et d'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, en juillet 1999. Les pr\u00e9occupations de Mme Dawson portaient notamment sur son casier de facteur. Cependant, Mme Daoust a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de se souvenir exactement si ces appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques avaient eu lieu au moment de la restructuration ou en d\u00e9cembre 2000, lorsque Mme Dawson a obtenu une copie du Rapport Cantin.\n[36] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a contredit avec v\u00e9h\u00e9mence le fait qu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 Mme Daoust en 1999. D'apr\u00e8s elle, il s'agit d'une pure fabrication. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle travaillait \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes depuis 1988 et qu'elle trouvait incroyable la supposition qu'elle aurait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 Mme Daoust apr\u00e8s juillet 1999 pour quelque raison que ce soit.\n[37] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'a appris l'existence de Mme Daoust que lorsqu'elle a eu connaissance du Rapport Cantin en novembre 2000. Le dossier d\u00e9montre que Mme Daoust a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Dawson le 18 janvier 2001 au sujet du Rapport Cantin. Mme Dawson a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Daoust pour la premi\u00e8re fois le 21 septembre 2001 dans le contexte du r\u00e8glement de sa premi\u00e8re plainte.\n[38] Lorsque que Mme Dawson lui a demand\u00e9 s'il \u00e9tait possible qu'elle ait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner apr\u00e8s le 7 ao\u00fbt 2001, apr\u00e8s la signature du proc\u00e8s-verbal du r\u00e8glement, Mme Daoust a r\u00e9pondu que tout \u00e9tait possible, qu'elle n'avait pas les dates. Lorsque le pr\u00e9sident lui a demand\u00e9 s'il fallait comprendre qu'entre 1999 et septembre 2001, elle avait re\u00e7u beaucoup d'appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de la part de Mme Dawson au cours desquelles celle-ci parlait de probl\u00e8mes qu'elle avait au travail, Mme Daoust a donn\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse suivante : [traduction] Bien, j'ai l'impression qu'on s'est parl\u00e9 peu de temps apr\u00e8s l'enqu\u00eate. \u00c9videmment, apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9couverte du rapport (\u00e0 la fin 2000), le nombre d'appels a augment\u00e9, les questions ont augment\u00e9es, mais \u00e0 quelles dates, comme j'ai dit, Mme Dawson est bonne avec les dates parce qu'elle \u00e9crit tout, elle sait quand, ainsi de suite; je n'ai pris aucune note.\n[39] La preuve d\u00e9montre que Mme Daoust a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de se souvenir pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment du moment o\u00f9 elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec Mme Dawson. De plus, compte tenu du d\u00e9roulement des \u00e9v\u00e9nements, du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Dawson ainsi que du t\u00e9moignage du Dr M., ci-dessous, selon lequel les personnes autistes sont [traduction] extraordinairement pr\u00e9cises au sujet des choses dont ils se plaignent, le Tribunal conclut que selon toute probabilit\u00e9, Mme Dawson a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 Mme Daoust apr\u00e8s qu'elle ait d\u00e9couvert le Rapport Cantin, c'est-\u00e0-dire en novembre 2000.\n[40] Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, c'est-\u00e0-dire le Rapport Cantin ainsi que le r\u00e8glement de 2001, fournissent un contexte pour la deuxi\u00e8me plainte de Mme Dawson et pr\u00e9sentent des renseignements importants quant \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui constituent une partie de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte de Mme Dawson.\nB. La carri\u00e8re de Mme Dawson \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes [41] Mme Dawson a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes en d\u00e9cembre 1988 comme factrice \u00e0 temps plein. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes pendant 15 ans, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle quitte en cong\u00e9 de maladie. Elle soutient qu'elle se sent maintenant comme si elle a un peu perdu son travail \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et qu'elle n'est pas motiv\u00e9e \u00e0 y retourner. Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle aimait beaucoup son travail et qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s important pour elle.\n[42] Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle \u00e9tait une tr\u00e8s bonne employ\u00e9e. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait un dossier de travail parfait \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes : elle ne prenait pas de journ\u00e9e de maladie; elle ne faisait pas de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire sur sa route; elle ne d\u00e9clarait aucun accident de travail; elle ne se plaignait pas lorsqu'on violait ses droits, aucune mesure disciplinaire n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 prise contre elle, m\u00eame pour des questions mineures; elle faisait tout ce dont la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes s'attendait de la part de ses employ\u00e9s. La preuve ne contredit pas ces affirmations. Aucun des t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes n'a mis en doute son dossier de travail parfait \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, au contraire.\n[43] Par exemple, dans la deuxi\u00e8me lettre \u00e9crite par Mme Daoust, qui portait sur la premi\u00e8re plainte et que Mme Dawson a rejet\u00e9e, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes reconna\u00eet clairement que son travail \u00e0 titre de factrice \u00e9tait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, exemplaire et qu'aucun client n'avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de plainte. Dans la lettre d'excuses qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e le 7 ao\u00fbt 2001 sur le tableau d'affichage de la succursale postale de Pierrefonds, Mme Traversy, gestionnaire des Relations du travail \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, reconna\u00eet clairement la confiance de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 envers les capacit\u00e9s de Mme Dawson et envers son engagement \u00e0 maintenir un travail de haute qualit\u00e9. Dans la lettre d'excuses, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes reconna\u00eet aussi que Mme Dawson n'a rien fait qui m\u00e9rite une plainte de la part de la gestion, de ses coll\u00e8gues ou des clients.\n[44] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que beaucoup de personnes sur son \u00e9tage de travail faisaient des choses tr\u00e8s gentilles pour elle et qu'elle les aidait. Cependant, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait des probl\u00e8mes avec ses superviseurs, principalement M. Schetagne et M. Potvin. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 des incidents pr\u00e9cis dans son t\u00e9moignage, dont l'un d'eux serait survenu la journ\u00e9e o\u00f9 M. Potvin est venu la voir et lui a dit qu'elle n'obtiendrait pas les choses qu'elle avait demand\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement et o\u00f9 il avait jet\u00e9 son casier de tri. Mme Dawson a aussi mentionn\u00e9 un incident o\u00f9 M. Schetagne l'a empoign\u00e9e et l'a pouss\u00e9e en dehors de son bureau.\n[45] Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait tent\u00e9 d'accommoder Mme Dawson de nombreuses fa\u00e7ons, que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, d'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, avait contourn\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles, ou n'en avait pas tenu compte, afin d'accommoder Mme Dawson. Mme Dawson a contest\u00e9 avec v\u00e9h\u00e9mence cette affirmation.\n[46] Par exemple, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la restructuration de la succursale postale de Pierrefonds qui, d'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, a eu lieu au printemps 1999, Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait tent\u00e9 de changer le moins possible la route de livraison de Mme Dawson, compte tenu du fait qu'elle \u00e9tait autiste, que tout changement \u00e0 la route de livraison de Mme Dawson entra\u00eenait beaucoup d'adaptation pour elle et qu'au cours de la restructuration des routes de livraison \u00e0 la succursale postale de Pierrefonds, la route de Mme Dawson n'avait pas fait partie du processus d'adjudication afin de lui permettre de garder la majeure partie de sa route et de r\u00e9duire au minimum tout changement.\n[47] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, afin d'accommoder Mme Dawson, on lui a permis de commencer \u00e0 travailler avant ses coll\u00e8gues, puisqu'on lui a permis de ramasser son courrier avant les autres facteurs. Mme Daoust a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a modifi\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9clairage afin de r\u00e9pondre au besoin de Mme Dawson ou \u00e0 sa demande de diminuer la luminosit\u00e9.\n[48] Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'on lui a dit que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait aussi permis \u00e0 Mme Dawson de laisser la configuration de son casier de tri comme elle \u00e9tait, m\u00eame si elle ne respectait pas les normes nationales, et qu'elle lui avait permis de trier son courrier d'une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente de tous les autres employ\u00e9s. Pour Mme Daoust, il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une autre mesure d'accommodement fournie par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes.\n[49] Mme Daoust a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'on lui a dit que le casier de Mme Dawson avait \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 parce qu'elle ne pouvait pas travailler correctement avec les normes existantes. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les facteurs pouvaient apporter des ajustements mineurs \u00e0 la conception de leur casier. Cependant, ils \u00e9taient tenus de respecter les normes nationales. Si un facteur n'\u00e9tait pas satisfait des normes nationales, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il pouvait porter appel, mais qu'autrement, sauf pour des changements mineurs, il devait s'adapter \u00e0 la conception du casier qui correspondait aux normes nationales. Les griefs \u00e9taient r\u00e9gl\u00e9s en fonction de la convention collective.\n[50] Dans le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Daoust, Mme Dawson a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Daoust qu'elle avait pu modifier son casier parce que celui-ci \u00e9tait plein d'erreurs. Mme Daoust a r\u00e9pondu que Mme Dawson n'aimait pas les normes nationales et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle supposait que Mme Dawson avait eu la permission d'avoir un casier sp\u00e9cial en raison de son \u00e9tat et qu'autrement, elle n'aurait pas eu le droit d'installer son casier de la fa\u00e7on dont elle l'avait fait. Elle aurait eu \u00e0 respecter les normes nationales.\n[51] Mme Dawson s'est fortement oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle le casier qu'on lui avait donn\u00e9 \u00e9tait un bon casier qui respectait les normes nationales. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait rejet\u00e9 au pied lev\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de la conception de son casier, qu'elle n'avait pas cru qu'il s'agissait de pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes et qu'elle avait suppos\u00e9 que les modifications qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es afin d'accommoder son \u00e9tat. Mme Dawson a exprim\u00e9 l'avis selon lequel les modifications qu'elle avait apport\u00e9es \u00e0 son casier n'avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec son \u00e9tat, mais qu'elles portaient plut\u00f4t sur la conception d\u00e9fectueuse ou probl\u00e9matique du casier.\n[52] Mme Dawson a aussi all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l'accommodement est devenu un probl\u00e8me lorsque la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a eu connaissance de son diagnostic en 1999 et qu'avant cela, de son entr\u00e9e en poste en 1988 jusqu'en 1999, cela n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 un probl\u00e8me. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait demand\u00e9 des mesures d'accommodement deux fois en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que ses demandes portaient sur la flexibilit\u00e9 de son horaire et sur le besoin d'enregistrer les conversations dans un environnement hostile. En ce qui a trait aux autres mesures susmentionn\u00e9es, \u00e0 son avis, elles ne portaient pas sur son \u00e9tat. Selon elle, d'autres facteurs avaient demand\u00e9 des accommodements semblables.\nC. L'\u00e9tat m\u00e9dical de Mme Dawson [53] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son premier diagnostic d'autisme a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90, par M. T., qui avait un doctorat en psychologie et \u00e9tait chercheur \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et par la Dre K.\n[54] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 9 avril 1999, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Christian Potvin, M. T. d\u00e9clare ce qui suit : [traduction] L'autisme se caract\u00e9rise par des d\u00e9ficiences qualitatives en mati\u00e8re d'interactions sociales, des difficult\u00e9s qualitatives en communication, un besoin intense de structure ainsi que certains comportements qui pourraient \u00eatre per\u00e7us comme bizarres. Il ajoute : [traduction] En raison de ce trouble, Mme Dawson a besoin d'un environnement hautement structur\u00e9 et constant afin de bien fonctionner et elle aura donc des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 s'adapter aux changements dans sa routine de travail. Mme Dawson est une femme intelligente qui semble \u00eatre capable de composer avec son environnement et d'adapter celui-ci afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins sp\u00e9ciaux que sa d\u00e9ficience cr\u00e9e. \u00c0 la fin de sa lettre, M. T. d\u00e9clare qu'il reste \u00e0 la disposition de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toute question qu'elle puisse avoir au sujet du trouble autistique et qu'avec la permission de Mme Dawson, il lui ferait plaisir de r\u00e9pondre aux questions portant sur son cas pr\u00e9cis.\n[55] Dans une note \u00e9crite le 7 avril 1999, \u00e0 qui de droit, la Dre K. d\u00e9clare que Michelle Dawson est l'une de ses patientes depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, que Mme Dawson est autiste et qu'afin qu'elle puisse continuer d'effectuer ses t\u00e2ches correctement, elle a besoin de souplesse en mati\u00e8re d'horaires et de zones de travail.\n[56] La preuve d\u00e9montre que les services de sant\u00e9 de Medisys, la firme externe qui s'occupe des questions m\u00e9dicales des employ\u00e9s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, ont re\u00e7u la lettre de M. T. ainsi que la note de la Dre K. le 14 avril 1999. Il convient de noter que Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle croyait que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait pris connaissance de son \u00e9tat en avril 1999.\n[57] Le Tribunal conclut que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a clairement \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de l'\u00e9tat de Mme Dawson en avril 1999. Quant \u00e0 elle, Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle a eu connaissance de l'\u00e9tat de Mme Dawson en juillet 1999, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le Rapport Cantin.\n[58] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s qu'elle a avis\u00e9 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes de son diagnostic, tout a mal tourn\u00e9. Avant cela, m\u00eame si Mme Dawson se pr\u00e9sentait au travail avec des blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es, cela ne semblait pas cr\u00e9er de questions ou de pr\u00e9occupations pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les choses ont chang\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que certains employ\u00e9s de Pierrefonds se sont sentis menac\u00e9s par elle et qu'ils ont envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 Mme Daoust en juillet 1999.\n[59] Cependant, le dossier d\u00e9montre que le 6 septembre 2001, Mme Dawson a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de parler \u00e0 environ 100 de ses coll\u00e8gues dans le contexte du r\u00e8glement de sa premi\u00e8re plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s ce jour, elle n'a eu aucun probl\u00e8me avec ses coll\u00e8gues. M\u00eame les quelques personnes qui la regardaient encore d'un air suspect ne se moquaient plus d'elle. Les nouveaux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la succursale postale ont obtenu des renseignements justes \u00e0 son sujet et ses coll\u00e8gues s'assuraient d'aviser les nouveaux employ\u00e9s de la fa\u00e7on dont ils devaient se comporter envers elle. Il semble que ses coll\u00e8gues se soient donn\u00e9s beaucoup de mal afin d'avertir les nouveaux employ\u00e9s de l'\u00e9tat de Mme Dawson et du fait qu'il fallait parfois la traiter diff\u00e9remment des autres employ\u00e9s. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, la r\u00e9union d'\u00e9tage avait eu un effet remarquable sur ses coll\u00e8gues. Cette r\u00e9union de 5 minutes avait constitu\u00e9, pour Mme Dawson, un tournant d\u00e9cisif dans la fa\u00e7on dont ses coll\u00e8gues la percevaient. D'apr\u00e8s elle, la cl\u00e9 de ce tournant \u00e9tait le fait que ses coll\u00e8gues avaient obtenu des renseignements justes \u00e0 son sujet et qu'ils avaient maintenant une certaine id\u00e9e des cons\u00e9quences de leurs actions.\nIII. ASPECTS JURIDIQUES [60] La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Dawson soul\u00e8ve un certain nombre de questions juridiques ainsi que des questions pr\u00e9cises en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[61] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, par cette plainte, elle tentait d'obtenir une d\u00e9cision qui \u00e9tablisse que les personnes autistes sont des humains prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et qui statue sur la question de savoir si les personnes autistes sont humaines au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et que la Loi les prot\u00e9ge .\n[62] Quant \u00e0 la Commission, dans ses observations finales, elle soutient que les questions que le Tribunal doit trancher par rapport \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte sont :\nSi l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas garanti \u00e0 la plaignante un environnement de travail libre de tout harc\u00e8lement parce qu'elle n'a pas r\u00e9pondu de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e aux pr\u00e9occupations et aux besoins de la plaignante ou parce qu'elle l'a trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on intol\u00e9rante et paternaliste et qu'elle n'a pas fait preuve de diligence raisonnable afin de garantir que l'environnement de travail de la plaignante \u00e9tait libre de tout harc\u00e8lement; Si l'intim\u00e9e a fait preuve envers la plaignante de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience parce qu'elle n'a pas r\u00e9pondu de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9occupations et \u00e0 ses besoins ou parce qu'elle l'a trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on intol\u00e9rante et paternaliste et qu'elle n'a pas fait preuve de diligence raisonnable afin de garantir que l'environnement de travail de la plaignante \u00e9tait libre de tout harc\u00e8lement; Si l'intim\u00e9e a fait preuve envers la plaignante de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience parce que, lorsqu'on lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande appuy\u00e9e par des recommandations m\u00e9dicales, elle n'a pas accommod\u00e9 les besoins de la plaignante en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'enregistrement des conversations avec la gestion; Si l'employeur a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre la plaignante parce qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 l'une de ses plaintes, ou les deux, aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[63] Le Tribunal traitera tour \u00e0 tour chacune de ces questions, c'est-\u00e0-dire si les personnes autistes sont des humains et sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, si on a fait preuve de discrimination envers Mme Dawson dans le cadre de son emploi, si la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle parce qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, ainsi que si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail.\nA. Les principes juridiques applicables [64] Il importe d'entr\u00e9e de jeu d'exposer les principes juridiques applicables \u00e0 l'examen des points soulev\u00e9s par la plaignante contre l'intim\u00e9e en ce qui concerne la discrimination, les repr\u00e9sailles et le harc\u00e8lement.\n(i) Discrimination [65] Dans les affaires portant sur les droits de la personne, de m\u00eame que dans les affaires civiles, il incombe au plaignant, ou au demandeur, d'\u00e9tablir ce qu'il avance, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve. Celui qui r\u00e9clame l'ex\u00e9cution d'une obligation doit la prouver. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons Sears Ltd. (O'Malley), [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536.)\n[66] Cela dit, dans les proc\u00e9dures port\u00e9es devant les tribunaux des droits de la personne, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination avant que la charge de la preuve soit transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, lequel doit alors donner une explication raisonnable, autre qu'un simple pr\u00e9texte, propre \u00e0 convaincre le Tribunal que, par exemple, la raison pour laquelle une personne n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste n'avait absolument rien \u00e0 voir avec un motif de distinction illicite. Comme l'\u00e9crivait le juge McIntyre dans l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, la preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve du contraire est une preuve qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffit \u00e0 justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9. Autrement dit, la preuve prima facie est une preuve qui, si elle est jug\u00e9e cr\u00e9dible, et si l'intim\u00e9 n'y r\u00e9pond pas d'une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante, suffira au plaignant pour avoir gain de cause.\n[67] Dans la d\u00e9cision Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [2005] A.C.F. n\u00b0 731, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re O'Malley \u00e9tait le crit\u00e8re juridique de la preuve prima facie de discrimination pr\u00e9vue par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Selon ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, est une question mixte de droit et de fait la question de savoir si la preuve produite dans un cas donn\u00e9 suffit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une diff\u00e9rence pr\u00e9judiciable de traitement fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite, lorsque cette preuve est jug\u00e9e cr\u00e9dible et que l'intim\u00e9 n'y a pas r\u00e9pondu d'une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante (d\u00e9cision Morris, paragraphe 27).\n[68] Le Tribunal partage l'opinion exprim\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Singh c. Canada (Statistique Canada), [1998] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 7, au paragraphe 197, opinion selon laquelle, pour que soit \u00e9tablie une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le plaignant doit offrir davantage que des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations h\u00e2tives. Par ailleurs, comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Bobb, une simple all\u00e9gation selon laquelle telle ou telle conduite \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par des distinctions illicites ne saurait remplacer une preuve des faits (Bobb c. Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission), [2004] A.J. no 117, paragraphe 76). Le Tribunal partage \u00e9galement l'opinion selon laquelle un tribunal devrait s'abstenir de conclure \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite lorsque la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par le plaignant peut raisonnablement avoir une autre explication.\n[69] La conviction, si ferme soit-elle, qu'une personne est victime de discrimination ne permet pas en droit de conclure \u00e0 l'existence de discrimination ni n'\u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination (Singh c. (Statistique Canada) [1998] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 7, paragraphe 206). Comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., [2005] TCDP 32, au paragraphe 40, il doit y avoir une certaine preuve, c'est-\u00e0-dire quelque chose qui fait en sorte qu'il est plus probable qu'une pr\u00e9tention particuli\u00e8re soit vraie qu'il est probable qu'elle ne le soit pas.\n[70] Au fil des ans, les tribunaux des droits de la personne ont reconnu que les plaignants disposent rarement d'une preuve directe attestant que la discrimination \u00e9tait le facteur \u00e0 l'origine d'une d\u00e9cision ou d'un comportement, et cela parce que la discrimination n'est pas une attitude que l'on manifeste en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ouvertement. Comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1988] C.C.D.P. n\u00b0 2, il est rare qu'on puisse prouver par des preuves directes qu'un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis.\n[71] Un plaignant qui all\u00e8gue la discrimination doit donc le plus souvent s'en remettre \u00e0 une preuve circonstancielle, et notamment \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont telle personne ou telle organisation s'est comport\u00e9e envers lui (Brooks c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans), 2006 A.C.F. n\u00b0 1569, paragraphe 27). Le crit\u00e8re est le suivant : la preuve circonstancielle, si elle est jug\u00e9e cr\u00e9dible, va-t-elle dans le sens de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e?\n[72] Dans la d\u00e9cision Brooks, le Tribunal \u00e9crivait, au sujet de la preuve circonstancielle, qu' il ne suffit pas que la preuve circonstancielle soit compatible avec une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination. Cela ne fait qu'\u00e9tablir la possibilit\u00e9 de discrimination, ce qui ne suffit pas \u00e0 prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de la cause. La preuve doit \u00eatre incompatible avec d'autres possibilit\u00e9s. (D\u00e9cision Brooks, paragraphe 114.)\n[73] Cela dit, comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Wall c. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, [1997] C.C.D.P. no 6, la norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination reste la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s et, s'agissant de la preuve circonstancielle, le crit\u00e8re est le suivant : on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se (B. Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Carwell, 1987, page 142).\n[74] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour savoir si une conduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est discriminatoire, le Tribunal doit analyser et examiner attentivement la conduite en soi ainsi que le contexte dans lequel elle s'est manifest\u00e9e, en gardant \u00e0 l'esprit, comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Marinaki c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines), [2000] C.C.D.P. n\u00b0 2, que, pour qu'un plaignant obtienne gain de cause, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit l'unique raison de l'acte reproch\u00e9, il suffit qu'elle l'explique en partie (d\u00e9cision Marinaki, paragraphe 191). L'intention d'exercer de la discrimination ne permet pas de conclure \u00e0 l'existence de discrimination (Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission) c. Play it Again Sports Ltd, [2004] N.S.J. no 403, paragraphe 37.)\n(ii) Repr\u00e9sailles [75] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, dans sa forme actuelle, ne consid\u00e8re les repr\u00e9sailles ou les menaces de repr\u00e9sailles que dans le cadre d'une plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et d'une conduite qui fait suite \u00e0 la plainte ainsi d\u00e9pos\u00e9e (Witwicky c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [2007] C.C.D.P. n\u00b0 28). La source des repr\u00e9sailles doit donc \u00eatre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte et non, par exemple, un \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui est survenu avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[76] La loi est claire. L'article 14.1 ne consid\u00e8re les repr\u00e9sailles qu'en rapport avec le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte. Par ailleurs, comme l'\u00e9crivait le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Marinaki c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines), [2000] C.C.D.P. n\u00b0 2, paragraphe 224, l'article 14.1 de la Loi est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 30 juin 1998, sans pr\u00e9voir d'effet r\u00e9troactif. Appliquer la nouvelle disposition relative aux mesures de repr\u00e9sailles de la Loi \u00e0 des actes qui sont survenus avant que l'article entre en vigueur serait d'accorder de nouvelles cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui sont survenus avant la promulgation. On donnerait ainsi un effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 la Loi, ce qui n'est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas admissible et ce qui n'est pas appuy\u00e9 par le libell\u00e9 de la Loi.\n(iii) Harc\u00e8lement [77] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne d\u00e9finit pas le harc\u00e8lement, mais la jurisprudence donne une telle d\u00e9finition. Dans la d\u00e9cision Hill c. Air Canada, 2003 TCDP 9, le Tribunal \u00e9crivait que le harc\u00e8lement r\u00e9side essentiellement dans la cr\u00e9ation d'un climat de travail hostile qui porte atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 personnelle du plaignant. Dans la d\u00e9cision Marinaki c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines), [2002] C.C.D.P. n\u00b0 2, le Tribunal examinait les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui doivent \u00eatre pris en compte lorsqu'il s'agit de savoir s'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement au sens de l'article 14 de la Loi.\n[78] Dans l'affaire Marinaki, le Tribunal exprimait l'avis que les victimes de harc\u00e8lement n'ont pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'elles ont subi des pertes financi\u00e8res, et que, pour qu'un comportement soit assimilable \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement, il faut une certaine r\u00e9p\u00e9tition ou persistance, encore que, dans certains cas, un seul incident grave suffise \u00e0 constituer du harc\u00e8lement (d\u00e9cision Marinaki, paragraphes 188 \u00e0 191). Comme on peut le lire dans le jugement Bobb c. Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission), [2004] A.J. no 117, un seul incident peut, dans certains cas, suffire \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile. Dans ces cas, la nature de la conduite doit \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e selon la r\u00e8gle des donn\u00e9es inversement proportionnelles : plus graves sont la conduite et ses cons\u00e9quences, moins la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de cette conduite sera n\u00e9cessaire; \u00e0 l'inverse, moins grave sera la conduite, plus elle devra avoir persist\u00e9.\nB. Les all\u00e9gations en cause [79] Mme Dawson croit sinc\u00e8rement que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a fait preuve de discrimination, de repr\u00e9sailles et de harc\u00e8lement envers elle. Le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'elle a subi porte sur plus que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements pr\u00e9cis qui ont eu lieu au travail. Il touche aussi la fa\u00e7on dont la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a trait\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9occupations.\n[80] Dans son formulaire de plainte, Mme Dawson souligne le fait que tout au long de la p\u00e9riode en cause, chaque fois qu'elle a discut\u00e9 avec un membre de l'intim\u00e9e, celle-ci a non seulement d\u00e9fendu ses employ\u00e9s, mais elle a fait l'\u00e9loge et a f\u00e9licit\u00e9 ceux qui, d'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, l'avaient insult\u00e9e, menac\u00e9e et bless\u00e9e et qui avaient viol\u00e9 ses droits. Elle soutient qu'elle a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises de d\u00e9couvrir, aupr\u00e8s de l'intim\u00e9e, ce qu'elle avait fait de mal. Elle fait valoir que l'intim\u00e9e continue de refuser de lui r\u00e9pondre.\n[81] Mme Dawson est d'avis que les actions de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur la croyance que les autistes sont incapables de s'exprimer eux-m\u00eames et de prendre leurs propres d\u00e9cisions, que seuls les experts et les personnes qui ne sont pas autistes ont des connaissances au sujet de cette maladie, que les autistes sont bizarres et qu'ils sont difficiles \u00e0 g\u00e9rer. Dans son formulaire de plainte, Mme Dawson d\u00e9clare qu'\u00e0 son travail, on la traitait comme une non-personne, m\u00eame si son dossier de travail restait excellent. Elle soutient qu'elle n'a jamais directement approch\u00e9 un membre de la gestion de la succursale postale de Pierrefonds pour quoi que ce soit, qu'elle a eu recours \u00e0 des interm\u00e9diaires afin de pr\u00e9venir des vagues d'intol\u00e9rance, de menaces et d'accusations de la part de l'intim\u00e9e et que tous les efforts qu'elle a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s afin de r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 et fortement ancr\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s \u00e9puisants pour elle, se sont effondr\u00e9s en raison de la mauvaise foi de la gestion. Elle exprime aussi l'opinion selon laquelle sa situation s'est aggrav\u00e9e depuis qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re plainte et que cela la porte \u00e0 croire qu'elle est victime de repr\u00e9sailles parce qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[82] Au-del\u00e0 de ces all\u00e9gations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, Mme Dawson et la Commission ont cibl\u00e9 certains employ\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e qui, ils soutiennent, ont fait preuve de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles contre Mme Dawson et l'ont harcel\u00e9e, et ont mentionn\u00e9 certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements au cours desquels l'intim\u00e9e, par les agissements de certains employ\u00e9s, a fait preuve de discrimination, de repr\u00e9sailles et de harc\u00e8lement envers Mme Dawson.\n[83] Le Tribunal analysera chacune des all\u00e9gations li\u00e9es aux employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9cis et \u00e0 certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Cependant, avant d'effectuer une telle analyse, le Tribunal tranchera la question de savoir si les autistes sont des personnes et sont ainsi prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question devrait donner des renseignements importants en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la situation des autistes, notamment celle de Mme Dawson.\n(i) Les autistes et la LCDP [84] \u00c0 ce sujet, le Tribunal a entendu le t\u00e9moignage du Dr M., qui est le seul m\u00e9decin qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, ainsi que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Dawson. L'intim\u00e9e n'a appel\u00e9 aucun expert.\na) Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Dawson [85] \u00c0 l'audience, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 une objection quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de Mme Dawson de parler de l'autisme en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Le Tribunal a conclu que, m\u00eame si Mme Dawson n'\u00e9tait pas une experte qualifi\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d'autisme, le fait qu'elle \u00e9tait autiste la rendait particuli\u00e8rement consciente de toutes les questions touchant l'autisme et il lui a permis de discuter de questions qui n'\u00e9taient pas limit\u00e9es \u00e0 son propre \u00e9tat.\n1. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Dawson sur l'autisme [86] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'autisme est une d\u00e9ficience neurologique et que les gens n'ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas une bonne compr\u00e9hension de cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Mme Dawson a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que l'autisme n'\u00e9tait pas une maladie mentale. D'apr\u00e8s elle, une maladie mentale a un d\u00e9but, divers traitements et il y a plus ou moins un retour \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat initial. Tant Mme Dawson que le Dr M., comme on le verra, ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la notion de gu\u00e9rir l'autisme \u00e9tait un non-sens. Pourtant, de nombreuses personnes veulent gu\u00e9rir l'autisme.\n[87] Mme Dawson a not\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'on ne permet pas aux autistes de parler de l'autisme, alors que les parents d'enfants autistes sont automatiquement consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des experts en la mati\u00e8re, non seulement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 \u00eatre parent d'un enfant autiste, mais en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'autisme comme tel. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, lorsqu'on prend des d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de politiques, on consulte in\u00e9vitablement les parents, mais rarement les personnes autistes. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation des autistes au Canada, Mme Dawson soutient que les associations sur l'autisme ne repr\u00e9sentent pas les personnes autistes. Ces associations ou ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s repr\u00e9sentent les familles de personnes autistes.\n[88] Mme Dawson a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les parents dirigent d'importants organismes de financement, y compris la Fondation Cure Autism Now, d\u00e9montrant ainsi que leurs objectifs peuvent contredire ce que la science dicte, puisque leur objectif est un monde o\u00f9 l'autisme n'existe pas, donc l'obtention d'un rem\u00e8de pour l'autisme, m\u00eame si c'est scientifiquement impossible et, d'apr\u00e8s elle, tr\u00e8s troublant sur le plan de l'\u00e9thique.\n[89] Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a pos\u00e9 la question \u00e0 savoir si c'\u00e9tait mal d'\u00eatre autiste, si l'autisme \u00e9tait une maladie qui devait \u00eatre \u00e9limin\u00e9e et si les personnes autistes devaient \u00eatre trait\u00e9es afin de les gu\u00e9rir de leur d\u00e9ficience. Elle a pos\u00e9 la question suivante : pourquoi r\u00e9agit-on \u00e0 l'autisme de cette fa\u00e7on? Elle a aussi demand\u00e9, compte tenu des divers comportements humains que nous acceptons, pourquoi l'autisme semble sortir de ces limites.\n2. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Dawson sur les autistes [90] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les autistes, par rapport aux personnes qui ne sont pas autistes, assimilent l'information de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente, \u00e0 un niveau de base profond, \u00e0 un niveau tr\u00e8s bas. D'apr\u00e8s elle, les processus cognitifs des autistes sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents, tout comme la fa\u00e7on dont ces processus cognitifs fonctionnent ensemble. Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le cerveau des autistes fonctionne diff\u00e9remment. Les personnes autistes ont besoin de types diff\u00e9rents d'information. Elle a soulign\u00e9 le fait qu'il y a des types d'information avec lesquels les autistes ne peuvent pas du tout travailler, mais que d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, il y a des types d'information avec lesquels les gens ordinaires ne peuvent pas travailler, alors que les autistes le peuvent.\n[91] Mme Dawson a aussi mentionn\u00e9 qu'il y a des moyens de communication qui permettent aux autistes de fonctionner, alors que d'autres rendent le fonctionnement impossible. D'apr\u00e8s elle, les autistes font ce qu'on leur demande de faire. \u00c0 son avis, peu de gens sont aussi faciles \u00e0 accommoder que les personnes autistes, il est tr\u00e8s facile d'accommoder un autiste.\n[92] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les personnes autistes comme elle ont besoin de savoir quelles r\u00e8gles s'appliquent et, si ces r\u00e8gles ne s'appliquent pas, elles ont besoin de le savoir. Il ne faut pas que les r\u00e8gles changent jour apr\u00e8s jour. Elle a aussi mentionn\u00e9 qu'on croit souvent que les autistes ont un mauvais comportement et qu'ils sont volontairement difficiles.\n[93] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, l'une des pires choses que l'on peut faire \u00e0 une personne autiste est de d\u00e9clarer que l'on n'a pas dit ce qu'on a r\u00e9ellement dit. Selon elle, cela cause une importante confusion \u00e0 la personne autiste parce qu'il est extr\u00eamement difficile pour elle de parler.\n[94] Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a mentionn\u00e9 l'affaire de Charles-Antoine Blais, un enfant autiste de six ans qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 assassin\u00e9 en 1996 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ce meurtre avait eu un fort impact sur elle, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'elle a appris que tout le monde croyait que c'\u00e9tait compr\u00e9hensible de tuer un enfant autiste.\n[95] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a aussi mentionn\u00e9 les personnes atteintes du syndrome de Down. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le syndrome de Down est dans la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie que l'autisme. Ce sont tous les deux des troubles du d\u00e9veloppement ou des troubles neurologiques du d\u00e9veloppement. Les personnes atteintes du syndrome de Down ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incluses dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avec toute l'aide et l'accommodement dont elles ont besoin, ce qui ne semble pas \u00eatre le cas pour les personnes autistes. Mme Dawson a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion selon laquelle les droits des personnes autistes ne seront jamais \u00e9tablis ou d\u00e9fendus.\n[96] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, il existe beaucoup de personnes autistes. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le taux prudent de pr\u00e9valence est de 60 pour 10 000, ce qui veut dire 1 personne sur 166. Cela signifie qu'il y aurait 197 000 personnes autistes au Canada. Aucune preuve documentaire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui de ces chiffres, mais Mme Dawson a mentionn\u00e9 l'estim\u00e9 du recensement de 2006 \u00e0 l'appui de ses all\u00e9gations. D'apr\u00e8s elle, 150 000 de ces 197 000 personnes autistes seraient des adultes et 47 000 seraient des enfants.\n3. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Dawson \u00e0 son sujet [97] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a parl\u00e9 des blessures qu'elle s'auto-infligeait. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au pire, il y avait probablement une semaine ou deux au cours desquelles, pendant deux semaines de suite, elle avait une blessure, elle s'\u00e9tait bless\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame. Cependant, elle a ajout\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait rare. D'apr\u00e8s elle, elle s'auto-infligeait des blessures environ une fois par mois, jamais plus. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pour les coupures, il n'y avait jamais plus qu'une petite zone affect\u00e9e et jamais plus qu'une ou deux coupures, mais elles se trouvaient au m\u00eame endroit.\n[98] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, bien avant que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes apprenne qu'elle \u00e9tait autiste, elle se pr\u00e9sentait au travail avec des blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es, que les signes de blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es n'ont pas commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 appara\u00eetre en 1999. D'apr\u00e8s elle, n'importe quand apr\u00e8s 1990, elle a montr\u00e9, \u00e0 certains moments, des signes de blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es, \u00e0 certains moments plus qu'\u00e0 d'autres, parfois avec de longs \u00e9carts.\nb) Le t\u00e9moignage du Dr M. [99] Au d\u00e9but de son t\u00e9moignage, le Tribunal a reconnu que le Dr M., qui est psychiatre, est un expert en mati\u00e8re d'autisme. Le Dr M. a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un rapport ainsi que trois lettres qui portaient sur l'\u00e9tat de Mme Dawson.\n[100] Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de la nature de l'autisme, des personnes autistes ainsi que de l'\u00e9tat de Mme Dawson. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du Dr M., ainsi que la justesse de ses d\u00e9clarations et de ses opinions, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9e. Le Tribunal conclut que le t\u00e9moignage du Dr M. est hautement cr\u00e9dible, m\u00eame si la preuve d\u00e9montre qu'au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, Mme Dawson a travaill\u00e9 avec lui et a co\u00e9crit des articles scientifiques avec le Dr M.\n1. Le t\u00e9moignage du Dr M. sur l'autisme [101] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr M. explique que l'autisme n'est pas un trouble mental, qu'il s'agit en fait d'une diff\u00e9rence neurobiologique plut\u00f4t que d'une d\u00e9ficience mentale. L'autisme est un \u00e9tat inn\u00e9. Il ne s'agit pas d'un \u00e9tat qu'une personne d\u00e9veloppe.\n[102] L'autisme se caract\u00e9rise par la pr\u00e9sence d'un certain nombre de sympt\u00f4mes qui d\u00e9passent un certain seuil. D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., ce qui est sp\u00e9cial avec l'autisme, c'est qu'il y a des niveaux extr\u00eamement diff\u00e9rents d'adaptation et d'intelligence apparente, que le niveau de d\u00e9ficience qui para\u00eet peut \u00eatre compl\u00e8tement incompatible avec le niveau r\u00e9el d'intelligence d'une personne autiste. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'autisme a de nombreuses caract\u00e9ristiques uniques, c'est-\u00e0-dire que c'est un \u00e9tat qui donne clairement certains avantages cognitifs aux personnes qui sont autistes.\n[103] Pour le Dr M., l'id\u00e9e de gu\u00e9rir l'autisme n'a aucun sens. La violence n'est absolument pas un probl\u00e8me attach\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autisme. D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., l'autisme se caract\u00e9rise par le fait que la partie pr\u00e9cise du cerveau qui s'occupe des activit\u00e9s sociales est bris\u00e9e dans le cerveau d'une personne autiste. Selon lui, les blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'autisme.\n2. Le t\u00e9moignage du Dr M. au sujet des personnes autistes [104] Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que plus de 90 % des personnes autistes ont une intelligence normale. D'apr\u00e8s lui, l'autisme sans maladie ou d\u00e9ficience mentale est d\u00e9sormais reconnu comme le portrait r\u00e9el des personnes autistes. Pour le Dr M., les autistes sont vuln\u00e9rables \u00e0 la malice de leurs pairs et ils sont d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9s par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les autistes ne sont pas violents par d\u00e9finition. Cependant, le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait certain que la plupart des gens sont r\u00e9ellement convaincus que la plupart des personnes autistes sont violentes, m\u00eame si ce n'est pas le cas. Selon lui, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les personnes qui ne sont pas autistes ont une mauvaise compr\u00e9hension de l'autisme.\n[105] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il passe beaucoup de temps en clinique \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par des personnes autistes et qu'il est toujours surpris par la pr\u00e9cision extraordinaire des choses dont elles se plaignent. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le mensonge est exceptionnel chez les personnes autistes et aussi que l'exag\u00e9ration et l'exploitation de leur handicap afin d'obtenir certains avantages leur sont \u00e9trang\u00e8res.\n[106] D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., un comportement compl\u00e8tement arbitraire ou qui semble \u00eatre compl\u00e8tement arbitraire est une chose avec laquelle les personnes autistes ne peuvent pas composer. Elles r\u00e9agissent tr\u00e8s bien \u00e0 une situation o\u00f9 il y a un ensemble de r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9es.\n[107] Le Dr M. partageait l'avis de Mme Dawson selon lequel les personnes autistes apprennent comment g\u00e9rer leurs r\u00e9actions en se fiant, par exemple, \u00e0 un endroit s\u00e9curitaire o\u00f9 elles peuvent aller, o\u00f9 elles peuvent s'\u00e9loigner de situations stressantes et qu'il est alors possible pour les autistes de composer avec des \u00e9v\u00e9nements tr\u00e8s difficiles, m\u00eame si ceux-ci provoquent de fortes r\u00e9actions. Le Dr M. souscrit aussi \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration selon laquelle si une personne autiste sait qu'elle peut avoir recours \u00e0 son m\u00e9canisme d'adaptation dans une situation de stress, il devient alors peut probable, et m\u00eame improbable, qu'elle se trouvera en situation de difficult\u00e9. Les autistes expriment leurs \u00e9motions ainsi que leur anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des personnes normales, soutient-il.\n[108] Selon le Dr M., les autistes g\u00e8rent l'information d'une fa\u00e7on beaucoup plus pr\u00e9cise que les personnes qui ne sont pas autistes. De plus, d'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., les personnes autistes n'enregistrent pas l'information de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que celles qui ne le sont pas. Les autistes sont \u00e0 leur meilleur lorsqu'ils travaillent avec de l'information. Pour les autistes qui sont plus \u00e9duqu\u00e9s, ils sont extr\u00eamement bons en science et en droit. En fait, selon le Dr M., le traitement de l'information chez les personnes autistes est sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui des personnes qui ne sont pas autistes, dans certaines conditions. Cependant, pour de nombreux aspects de la vie quotidienne, les autistes ont un certain d\u00e9savantage. Ainsi, le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les autistes vivent en fait dans un monde qui n'est pas fait pour eux.\n[109] Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les autistes n'ont aucun probl\u00e8me avec la hi\u00e9rarchie tant que cette hi\u00e9rarchie est constante et juste. Ils commencent \u00e0 avoir des probl\u00e8mes lorsque la hi\u00e9rarchie est intrins\u00e8quement contradictoire. Les autistes ne sont pas aussi rigides qu'on pourrait le croire. Ils peuvent s'adapter \u00e0 de nouvelles situations tant que les r\u00e8gles sont claires et tant que le cadre est constant. Dans un environnement o\u00f9 il y a peu ou pas de r\u00e8gles, ils ne fonctionneront pas correctement. D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., les personnes autistes fonctionneront mieux dans un environnement r\u00e9glement\u00e9. Le Dr M. a appuy\u00e9 la proposition selon laquelle tant qu'il y a un cadre constant en place, m\u00eame s'il arrive des \u00e9v\u00e9nements impr\u00e9vus, les autistes r\u00e9ussiront \u00e0 composer avec ces situations impr\u00e9vues et s'en sortiront bien.\n[110] Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, bien qu'une personne ordinaire puisse devenir agressive lorsqu'elle est anxieuse, les personnes autistes s'infligeront parfois des blessures. C'est particuli\u00e8rement le cas, d'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., lorsqu'une personne autiste ne comprend pas une situation ou n'obtient pas une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question. Selon le Dr M., les blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es sont la r\u00e9ponse la plus extr\u00eame \u00e0 une impasse psychologique pour laquelle il n'y a aucune solution. Il s'agit d'une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la d\u00e9sorganisation du monde. C'est une fa\u00e7on pour une personne autiste de r\u00e9pondre aux situations n\u00e9gatives, alors qu'une personne qui n'est pas autiste d\u00e9montrera de la col\u00e8re. Le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait connaissance de l'habitude de Mme Dawson de s'infliger des blessures. Il a vu l'une des blessures qu'elle s'\u00e9tait inflig\u00e9e. Pour le Dr M., une blessure auto-inflig\u00e9e est un signe de souffrance psychologique intense.\n[111] D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., les autistes auront aussi tendance \u00e0 se blesser intentionnellement lorsqu'elles souffrent de m\u00e9contentement physique ou psychologique interne. Donc, si une personne autiste se retrouve dans une situation o\u00f9 elle ne peut s'enfuir, ou si elle ressent un trouble, elle pourrait s'auto-infliger une blessure, par exemple se mordre le bras ou la main. Le Dr M. a ajout\u00e9 qu'il est tr\u00e8s difficile pour une personne qui n'est pas autiste de comprendre ce type de comportement.\n[112] Le Dr M. a aussi exprim\u00e9 l'opinion selon laquelle les personnes autistes sont rarement agressives. Les blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es, d'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., sont un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne mal compris au niveau scientifique. Il semble que les blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es puissent r\u00e9soudre certaines situations au niveau psychologique.\n[113] D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., les autistes se trouvent dans leur pire \u00e9l\u00e9ment lorsqu'ils doivent deviner tr\u00e8s rapidement la bonne fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9agir \u00e0 une certaine situation. Ils se trouvent dans leur meilleur \u00e9l\u00e9ment lorsqu'ils traitent de l'information complexe et lorsqu'ils effectuent du travail ou une action logique. Les personnes autistes sont tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cises. La routine est tr\u00e8s importante pour elles.\n[114] Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, si l'on accepte un certain nombre de conventions, les autistes seront en mesure de fonctionner. Ces personnes sont diff\u00e9rentes des personnes qui ne sont pas autistes parce que leurs sens sont diff\u00e9rents, les couleurs sont diff\u00e9rentes, les attributions au cerveau sont diff\u00e9rentes et la sollicitation d'une certaine fonction ou d'une certaine r\u00e9gion du cerveau pour certaines t\u00e2ches est diff\u00e9rente.\n[115] D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., les personnes autistes comprennent mal ce que d'autres personnes attendent d'elles, elles ont l'impression de ne pas \u00eatre correctes, de ne pas \u00eatre ad\u00e9quates, parce qu'elles font des choses simplement parce qu'elles ont besoin et qu'elles ont envie de les faire. Elles r\u00e9alisent que, lorsqu'elles ont une r\u00e9action spontan\u00e9e, cela cr\u00e9e des remous autour d'elles. Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, pour une personne autiste, l'abus verbal a un effet adverse. Si elle le peut, la personne autiste pr\u00e9f\u00e9rera se retirer en elle-m\u00eame.\n[116] Le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il est absolument faux de dire que les personnes autistes n'acceptent pas le changement et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il a re\u00e7u comme commentaire pour toutes les personnes autistes qu'il conna\u00eet et qui ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir un emploi que ces personnes sont les meilleurs employ\u00e9s. D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., si une personne autiste est employ\u00e9e en fonction de son niveau d'excellence, sa d\u00e9ficience devient une preuve d'excellence. D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., en milieu de travail, la nature sans formalit\u00e9 de certaines activit\u00e9s, telles que l'entr\u00e9e au travail, l'habillement, les pauses et les blagues peuvent pr\u00e9senter des difficult\u00e9s pour une personne autiste.\n[117] Le Dr M. a reconnu que pour les personnes autistes, l'accommodement se traduit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par des changements de comportement et d'interaction avec les personnes autistes. Cela dit, selon le Dr M., la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'est pas tr\u00e8s tol\u00e9rante envers l'accommodement des personnes autistes.\n[118] Le Dr M. soutient que les autistes devraient \u00eatre avis\u00e9s \u00e0 l'avance de ce qu'on attend d'eux et on devrait arriver \u00e0 une entente \u00e0 ce sujet. Le Dr M. a reconnu qu'il est parfois difficile d'arriver \u00e0 ce type de relations en milieu de travail. Il croit qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire d'avoir un type d'entente ou d'accord contractuel initial dans lequel toutes les attentes sont clairement expliqu\u00e9es et accept\u00e9es.\n[119] En contre-interrogatoire, le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que m\u00eame s'il arrive des situations inattendues en milieu de travail, il ne faut pas limiter ces situations, mais les rendre plus pr\u00e9visibles. Le Dr M. a donn\u00e9 comme exemple un changement de route : ce qui est important, c'est de fournir les bonnes explications. D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., l'inconnu soul\u00e8ve plus de probl\u00e8mes que l'impr\u00e9vu. Ainsi, en ce qui a trait aux autistes, l'une des fa\u00e7on d'accommoder une telle personne est de lui dire \u00e0 l'avance quels sont les changements qui seront apport\u00e9s et de lui expliquer afin qu'elle puisse se pr\u00e9parer. Les changements doivent \u00eatre explicites et compr\u00e9hensibles.\n[120] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsqu'une personne qui ne conna\u00eet pas l'autisme fait face \u00e0 un autiste, cette personne percevra l'autiste comme \u00e9tant impoli ou manipulateur. Le Dr M. explique que si les autistes agissent diff\u00e9remment dans une situation sociale, ce n'est peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e0 cause du caract\u00e8re social de la situation, mais de la quantit\u00e9 et du type d'information en cause.\n[121] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr M. a reconnu que si on suppose simplement que les autistes ont un mauvais comportement, cela explique beaucoup des difficult\u00e9s sociales auxquelles les autistes font face. D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., une grande partie de leur \u00e9tranget\u00e9 apparente d\u00e9coule de ce type d'absence de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9. Pour le Dr M., on peut tr\u00e8s bien vivre en harmonie avec une personne autiste en apportant quelques accommodements mineurs. Il t\u00e9moigne aussi que les personnes autistes ont parfois besoin de se retirer pour un certain temps et qu'il faut leur permettre de le faire. Il reconna\u00eet qu'il est impossible de satisfaire \u00e0 certaines des mesures d'accommodement que les autistes demandent.\n[122] D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., la plupart du temps, les autistes savent ce qu'ils doivent faire pour prendre soin d'eux-m\u00eames. Ils savent aussi ce qu'ils doivent \u00e9viter. Le Dr M. soutient que les autistes ont une na\u00efvet\u00e9 sociale.\n3. Le t\u00e9moignage du Dr M. au sujet de Mme Dawson [123] Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Dawson pour la premi\u00e8re fois apr\u00e8s l'avoir vue \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9e Enjeux en 2001. \u00c0 l'audience, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'avant la diffusion de l'\u00e9mission Enjeux, elle avait tent\u00e9 de fr\u00e9quenter la clinique du Dr M., mais elle ne s'\u00e9tait jamais rendue plus loin qu'\u00e0 la r\u00e9ception. La preuve d\u00e9montre que Mme Dawson a rencontr\u00e9 le Dr M. en avril 2001. \u00c0 ce moment, il a rendu un diagnostic d'autisme au sujet de Mme Dawson. D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., Mme Dawson est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une personne qui a un haut niveau de fonctionnement.\n[124] Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9crit une premi\u00e8re lettre pour Mme Dawson en 2002. La preuve d\u00e9montre que Mme Dawson a travaill\u00e9 avec le Dr M. pendant quelques ann\u00e9es et qu'ils ont co\u00e9crit des articles. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa relation de travail avec Mme Dawson, le Dr M. a pu d\u00e9clarer dans son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Dawson disait les choses comme elle les voyait, qu'elle avait un bon jugement et qu'elle prenait de bonnes d\u00e9cisions. Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il croyait que les d\u00e9cisions que Mme Dawson prenait \u00e0 son travail \u00e9taient bonnes, puisqu'il ne l'avait jamais vue prendre une d\u00e9cision avec laquelle il \u00e9tait en d\u00e9saccord d'apr\u00e8s son jugement. Le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cela ne signifie pas que Mme Dawson ne peut jamais avoir tort.\n[125] D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., Mme Dawson a la capacit\u00e9 d'accepter les erreurs d'un autre point de vue que le sien. Il a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les deux principales difficult\u00e9s de Mme Dawson sont li\u00e9es au sentiment d'urgence et au sentiment d'\u00e9puisement. Donc, d'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., lorsque Mme Dawson veut quelque chose, elle le veut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement imm\u00e9diatement. Alors que les personnes qui ne sont pas autistes feront quelque chose s'ils y croient \u00e0 98 %, les autistes doivent y croire \u00e0 100 %. Cela peut cr\u00e9er l'impression ou le sentiment que Mme Dawson n'est jamais satisfaite et qu'elle n'est jamais heureuse.\n[126] Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'accommodement de Mme Dawson et \u00e0 son fonctionnement en milieu de travail, il est important de consulter Mme Dawson. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi c'\u00e9tait important, le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait parce que Mme Dawson en savait plus que les personnes qui ne sont pas des experts en mati\u00e8re d'autisme.\n[127] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne comprenait pas tr\u00e8s bien ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 au travail de Mme Dawson et qu'il ne s'int\u00e9ressait pas \u00e0 la question de l'emploi de celle-ci. En fait, compte tenu de la mauvaise atmosph\u00e8re qui r\u00e9gnait au travail de Mme Dawson, le Dr M. a \u00e9t\u00e9 prudent dans son \u00e9valuation de Mme Dawson, parce qu'il croyait qu'il \u00e9tait possible qu'elle tente d'obtenir des profits. Son int\u00e9r\u00eat principal visait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si Mme Dawson \u00e9tait autiste ou non.\n[128] Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas particuli\u00e8rement au courant des mesures que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait prises afin d'accommoder Mme Dawson. Cela dit, le dossier d\u00e9montre que le Dr M. a \u00e9crit deux lettres dans lesquelles il d\u00e9clarait que Mme Dawson est autiste et dans lesquelles il donnait des renseignements au sujet de son \u00e9tat. Lorsqu'il a sign\u00e9 ces lettres, le Dr M. ne savait pas exactement \u00e0 quoi elles serviraient ou comment Mme Dawson les utiliserait. D'apr\u00e8s le Dr M., ces lettres \u00e9taient de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et Mme Dawson d\u00e9ciderait de l'utilisation qu'elle souhaitait en faire.\n[129] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que la deuxi\u00e8me lettre porte sur les blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es de Mme Dawson. Dans sa lettre, le Dr M. r\u00e9p\u00e8te que Mme Dawson est autiste et il mentionne le fait que son \u00e9quilibre psychologique est maintenu par des actes de blessures auto-inflig\u00e9es \u00e0 la maison, que c'est une fa\u00e7on pour elle de composer psychologiquement avec de fortes r\u00e9actions \u00e9motionnelles et qu'il ne faut pas voir ces actions comme une expression de col\u00e8re.\n[130] Le Dr M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Dawson lui avait dit que les blessures qu'elle s'auto-infligeait l'aidaient psychologiquement. Pour le Dr M., Mme Dawson avait l'habitude de s'auto-infliger des blessures. Il interpr\u00e9tait ces actes comme un signe de souffrance psychologique majeure, comme un moyen que les autistes utilisaient afin de composer avec l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait personnellement vu l'une des blessures que Mme Dawson s'\u00e9tait inflig\u00e9e et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la blessure \u00e9tait impressionnante et qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionnante pour ses coll\u00e8gues.\n[131] Dans sa deuxi\u00e8me lettre, le Dr M. d\u00e9clare que, comme toutes les personnes autistes qui ont une grande intelligence, Mme Dawson est particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rable \u00e0 la malveillance de ses pairs et elle peut avoir de fortes r\u00e9actions \u00e9motionnelles. Pour Mme Dawson, certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements impr\u00e9vus peuvent causer un type de d\u00e9sorganisation psychologique, m\u00eame du chaos et de la confusion, et peuvent g\u00e9n\u00e9rer une forte r\u00e9action qui peut se traduire par une blessure auto-inflig\u00e9e.\n[132] Le Tribunal conclut que les points de vue exprim\u00e9s par Mme Dawson et par le Dr M. au sujet de l'autisme et des personnes autistes servent de contexte ad\u00e9quat pour l'analyse des all\u00e9gations de discrimination, de harc\u00e8lement et de repr\u00e9sailles que Mme Dawson a \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans sa plainte.\n[133] Cela dit, le Tribunal ne doute aucunement que les personnes autistes sont des personnes, qu'elles ne sont malheureusement pas bien accept\u00e9es dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qu'on les per\u00e7oit souvent comme des cr\u00e9atures sp\u00e9ciales qui n'en font pas enti\u00e8rement partie et qu'on croit que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 serait mieux sans elles. Le Tribunal est aussi d'avis que les autistes doivent \u00eatre mieux respect\u00e9s et prot\u00e9g\u00e9s dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Ils doivent avant tout \u00eatre mieux compris et mieux accept\u00e9s. Les t\u00e9moignages de Mme Dawson et du Dr M. offrent une meilleure compr\u00e9hension de l'autisme et des personnes autistes.\n[134] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal est d'avis que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne offre aux autistes la m\u00eame protection qu'aux personnes qui ne sont pas autistes et qu'ils sont tous \u00e9gaux devant la loi.\n(ii) Les all\u00e9gations portant sur certaines personnes [135] Dans son formulaire de plainte, Mme Dawson mentionne certaines personnes qui, elle soutient, ont fait preuve de discrimination, de repr\u00e9sailles et de harc\u00e8lement envers elle.\n[136] Mme Dawson d\u00e9clare donc dans son formulaire de plainte que, comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, elle a souvent tent\u00e9 de demander \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e ce qu'elle avait fait de mal et que, le 27 mai 2002, Christian Potvin, surintendant de la succursale postale de Pierrefonds, l'a r\u00e9primand\u00e9e parce qu'elle avait pos\u00e9 cette question. Mme Dawson soutient aussi que le 24 mai 2002, Mme Louise Lefebvre, secteur des Op\u00e9rations de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, lui a dit que le probl\u00e8me n'\u00e9tait pas qu'elle avait fait quelque chose de mal; le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait qu'elle \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente. Il convient de noter que ni M. Christian Potvin, ni Mme Louise Lefebvre n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[137] Mme Dawson d\u00e9clare aussi que le 22 octobre 2001, la conseill\u00e8re en \u00e9thique de l'intim\u00e9e, Carman Lapointe-Young, lui a dit qu'elle \u00e9tait violente, que les probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 son lieu de travail d\u00e9coulaient enti\u00e8rement de sa d\u00e9ficience et que si elle n'\u00e9tait pas autiste, il n'y aurait aucun probl\u00e8me. Mme Dawson soutient aussi que le 24 octobre 2002, Mme Huguette Demers, la directrice des Ressources humaines de l'intim\u00e9e au Qu\u00e9bec, a aussi mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle supposait que Mme Dawson \u00e9tait violente, \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle avait peu de renseignements \u00e0 son sujet, mais o\u00f9 elle savait qu'elle \u00e9tait une personne qui avait une d\u00e9ficience. Ni Mme Huguette Demers, ni Mme Lapointe-Young n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[138] Dans sa preuve, Mme Dawson mentionne en particulier une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu'elle a eue avec Mme Carman Lapointe-Young. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, pendant la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, Mme Lapointe-Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Dawson avait commis des actes violents, dont une effusion de sang sur le plancher \u00e0 son lieu de travail devant ses coll\u00e8gues, et qu'elle s'\u00e9tait mutil\u00e9e devant ses coll\u00e8gues. Selon le t\u00e9moignage Mme Dawson, Mme Lapointe-Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle croyait que c'\u00e9tait vrai. De plus, d'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, Mme Lapointe-Young avait dit, au cours de la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, que le probl\u00e8me majeur \u00e9tait l'autisme.\n[139] De plus, dans son formulaire de plainte, Mme Dawson mentionne M. Raymond Poirier, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Op\u00e9rations au Qu\u00e9bec, qui, selon elle, lui a dit qu'elle n'avait pas droit \u00e0 la mesure d'accommodement au sujet de l'enregistrement des conversations parce que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes n'aimait pas l'id\u00e9e. Elle mentionne aussi M. Christian Potvin, chef de la succursale postale de Pierrefonds, qui, selon elle, l'avait r\u00e9primand\u00e9e le 27 mai 2002 parce qu'elle avait demand\u00e9 ce qu'elle avait fait de mal. Elle mentionne aussi Mme Lefebvre, du secteur des Op\u00e9rations de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, qui, selon elle, lui a dit le 24 mai 2002 que son probl\u00e8me n'\u00e9tait pas qu'elle faisait quelque chose de mal, mais plut\u00f4t qu'elle \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente.\n[140] Aucunes des personnes cit\u00e9es dans le formulaire de plainte de Mme Dawson n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner par l'intim\u00e9e. Le Tribunal n'a donc que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Dawson.\n[141] Dans ses observations finales, la Commission a quant \u00e0 elle mentionn\u00e9 le comportement d'un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes qui, selon la Commission, constitue un comportement discriminatoire de la part de l'intim\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire M. Christian Potvin, l'un des superviseurs de Mme Dawson, M. Richard Paradis, un gestionnaire charg\u00e9 des relations de travail \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, Mme Huguette Demers, directrice des Ressources humaines au Qu\u00e9bec, ainsi que Mme Carman Lapointe-Young, la conseill\u00e8re en \u00e9thique de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes.\n[142] Compte tenu de la preuve et de la nature des all\u00e9gations de Mme Dawson, le Tribunal ne traitera que de l'all\u00e9gation portant sur Mme Lapointe-Young. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation portant sur Mme Demers, elle traite d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui a eu lieu en octobre 2002. Cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement d\u00e9passe la port\u00e9e de la plainte, soit de septembre 2001 \u00e0 juin 2002, et le Tribunal ne l'examinera pas.\n[143] Le Tribunal conclut que Mme Dawson est un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible. Il note que dans son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr M. a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il est exceptionnel pour un autiste de mentir et que l'exag\u00e9ration et l'exploitation de leur handicap afin d'obtenir certains profits sont \u00e9trang\u00e8res aux personnes autistes.\n[144] Cela dit, le dossier d\u00e9montre que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve qui contredisait Mme Dawson au sujet des remarques que Mme Lapointe-Young aurait faites au cours d'une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec Mme Dawson le 22 octobre 2001, \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui a clairement \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans le formulaire de plainte comme \u00e9tant possiblement discriminatoire.\n[145] Le Tribunal conclut que les remarques \u00e9taient discriminatoires parce qu'elles font para\u00eetre Mme Dawson comme une personne violente en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, une perception qui, compte tenu de la preuve, est totalement gratuite. Le Tribunal conclut donc que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination en ce qui a trait aux commentaires que Mme Lapointe-Young aurait faits au sujet de son \u00e9tat et il conclut aussi que ces all\u00e9gations satisfont au crit\u00e8re O'Malley, c'est-\u00e0-dire des all\u00e9gations qui, si on leur ajoute foi, sont compl\u00e8tes et suffisantes pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune explication raisonnable \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[146] Ainsi, le Tribunal conclut que Mme Dawson a \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience, en contravention \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi. Cependant, la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que le comportement de Mme Lapointe-Young constitue du harc\u00e8lement ou des repr\u00e9sailles.\n(iii) Les all\u00e9gations li\u00e9es \u00e0 des incidents pr\u00e9cis [147] Dans son formulaire de plainte, Mme Dawson mentionne des incidents pr\u00e9cis et clairement d\u00e9finis qui, selon elle, contreviennent aux articles 7, 14 et 14.1 de la Loi. Il s'agit : 1. du dossier m\u00e9dical de Mme Dawson; 2. de la r\u00e9union \u00e0 Ottawa; 3. de l'accident de travail de Mme Dawson; 4. du refus de l'intim\u00e9e de lui permettre d'enregistrer les conversations. Le Tribunal analysera chaque incident s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\na) Le dossier m\u00e9dical de Mme Dawson [148] Mme Dawson soutient dans son formulaire de plainte que le dossier m\u00e9dical de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 son sujet auquel elle soutient avoir eu acc\u00e8s en octobre 2001, apr\u00e8s que l'intim\u00e9e en ait ni\u00e9 l'existence de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, est nettement partial, qu'il s'agit d'une description inexacte d'interventions extr\u00eames et qu'il s'agit de harc\u00e8lement envers elle. Mme Dawson soutient aussi que le comportement de l'intim\u00e9e envers elle, tel que document\u00e9 par les dossiers de l'intim\u00e9e, est discriminatoire et est \u00e9videmment fond\u00e9 sur le fait que l'intim\u00e9e a assimil\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience avec le fait qu'elle \u00e9tait une menace dangereuse, sale, et folle.\n[149] \u00c0 l'audience, pour des raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 la protection de sa vie priv\u00e9e, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas pr\u00e9senter en preuve son dossier m\u00e9dical. En effet, le dossier d\u00e9montre que tout au long de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson, h\u00e9sitait \u00e0 rendre disponible aux autres parties et au Tribunal des documents de nature priv\u00e9e, particuli\u00e8rement son dossier m\u00e9dical, compte tenu de la mauvaise exp\u00e9rience qu'elle avait eue par le pass\u00e9 \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, en raison de laquelle elle s'\u00e9tait sentie trahie par les actions de tierces parties.\n[150] Le Tribunal n'est donc pas en mesure d'\u00e9valuer le contenu du dossier m\u00e9dical de Mme Dawson et de prendre une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 savoir si le contenu \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Le Tribunal conclut que la plaignante n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son dossier m\u00e9dical.\nb) La r\u00e9union \u00e0 Ottawa [151] Dans son formulaire de plainte, la plaignante soutient que l'intim\u00e9e a pay\u00e9 son ancienne psychologue, Mme Nathalie Poirier, pour que cette derni\u00e8re fasse une pr\u00e9sentation aux fonctionnaires sup\u00e9rieurs du niveau national (y compris les avocats, les conseillers en \u00e9thique et le gestionnaire des Ressources humaines), ainsi qu'aux directeurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes (STTP) le 14 janvier 2002 au sujet de l'autisme. Mme Dawson fait valoir qu'aucune personne autiste n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9e, invit\u00e9e \u00e0 assister \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation ou m\u00eame avis\u00e9e de la tenue de celle-ci. Mme Dawson soutient aussi dans son formulaire de plainte que Mme Poirier a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle ne la connaissait pas (m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait sa psychologue traitante pendant un certain temps) et qu'elle a donn\u00e9 une image tellement n\u00e9gative des personnes autistes \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9sentation que lorsque l'un des participants a demand\u00e9 s'il y avait quelque chose de bon au sujet des personnes autistes, elle a r\u00e9pondu que non.\n[152] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'embauche de Mme Poirier, le Tribunal a entendu le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Shirley Boucher, gestionnaire des droits de la personne \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, de M. Lafleur, un repr\u00e9sentant syndical, de Mme Daoust, ainsi que de Mme Dawson. Mme Boucher et Mme Daoust ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des circonstances qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'embauche de Mme Poirier. M. Lafleur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la r\u00e9union m\u00eame et Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des r\u00e9percussions que la r\u00e9union a eues sur elle.\n[153] Mme Boucher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, jusqu'en septembre 2001, elle \u00e9tait gestionnaire de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et que peu de temps apr\u00e8s, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e au poste de gestionnaire des droits de la personne. Mme Boucher travaillait \u00e0 Ottawa. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, Mme Huguette Demers \u00e9tait directrice des Ressources humaines pour la r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al. Mme Boucher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s sa nomination, elle a re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de Mme Dawson au sujet de sa premi\u00e8re plainte, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment au sujet du r\u00e8glement de sa plainte.\n[154] Mme Boucher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait discut\u00e9 au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec Mme Dawson plusieurs fois, quatre ou cinq fois, ou m\u00eame plus, au sujet du r\u00e8glement de la plainte, en particulier au sujet d'un probl\u00e8me li\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance du ch\u00e8que \u00e0 l'organisme \u00e0 but non-lucratif que Mme Dawson avait choisi. Ces conversations ont eu lieu entre septembre 2001 et d\u00e9cembre 2001. Mme Boucher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait de longues conversations.\n[155] Mme Boucher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Dawson avait aussi t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres personnes \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes : le bureau du pr\u00e9sident, Mme Carman Lapointe-Young, la directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale responsable de l'\u00e9thique et Mary Traversy, gestionnaire, Relations du travail.\n[156] Mme Boucher a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que des gens lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phonaient apr\u00e8s qu'ils aient re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de Mme Dawson. Ils \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s stress\u00e9s parce qu'ils sentaient que Mme Dawson \u00e9tait contrari\u00e9e et ils voulaient s'assurer que ce n'\u00e9taient pas eux qui l'avaient contrari\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que les conversations \u00e9taient longues et que les gens avaient de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer avec Mme Dawson et \u00e0 clore la conversation. Mme Boucher a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle-m\u00eame avait senti le besoin de trouver de l'aide de la part d'un expert pour que celui-ci parle aux gestionnaires qui avaient des probl\u00e8mes avec Mme Dawson et leur donne des renseignements et des directives au sujet de l'autisme et de la fa\u00e7on dont ils pouvaient mieux communiquer avec Mme Dawson.\n[157] Mme Boucher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise \u00e0 l'effet que les appels de Mme Dawson seraient tous trait\u00e9s par une seule personne, M. Richard Paradis, qui rempla\u00e7ait \u00e0 ce moment Mme Demers, la directrice des Ressources humaines. Le dossier d\u00e9montre, et le Tribunal conclut, que tous ces appels portaient sur la premi\u00e8re plainte et sur son r\u00e8glement. Plus loin dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Boucher a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle sache, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union du 14 janvier 2002 \u00e0 Ottawa, les gestionnaires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes n'ont plus re\u00e7u autant d'appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de la part de Mme Dawson.\n[158] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Boucher a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait elle qui avait lanc\u00e9 la recherche afin de trouver un expert sur l'autisme qui pourrait donner une s\u00e9ance d'information portant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur les questions de la communication et sur des renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'autisme.\n[159] Mme Boucher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 un moment, Mme Dawson lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9. Elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s contrari\u00e9e parce qu'elle avait appris que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes voulait embaucher une personne dont l'enfant \u00e9tait autiste, et non un sp\u00e9cialiste, afin de fournir des renseignements sur l'autisme aux gestionnaires.\n[160] Mme Dawson a clairement exprim\u00e9 ses inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet de l'embauche d'un expert dans une lettre qu'elle a \u00e9crite \u00e0 Mme Mary Traversy, le 12 novembre 2001. Dans sa lettre, Mme Dawson mentionne le fait que Mme Boucher a aussi embauch\u00e9 un conseiller, qui devait trouver un expert en autisme, qu'elle connaissait et qui \u00e9tait un m\u00e9t\u00e9orologue. Elle a ensuite mentionn\u00e9 ce qu'elle avait \u00e9crit dans sa lettre du 18 juin 2001 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Andr\u00e9 Ouellet : le fait d'\u00e9duquer la gestion au sujet de l'autisme - ce qu'elle n'avait jamais demand\u00e9 - entra\u00eenerait des cons\u00e9quences effroyables, comme celles qu'avait caus\u00e9 la lettre de la directrice du PAE. Elle exprime le point de vue selon lequel le fait de faire venir un expert semble confirmer que l'autisme est un probl\u00e8me, ce qui absout les gestionnaires de leur d\u00e9faut d'appliquer, envers elle comme envers tous les autres employ\u00e9s, les normes et les proc\u00e9dures existantes ou m\u00eame un minimum de d\u00e9fense et de comp\u00e9tence.\n[161] Le dossier d\u00e9montre qu'apr\u00e8s l'appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de Mme Dawson, Mme Boucher a communiqu\u00e9 avec l'Int\u00e9grale \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al afin de faire venir une personne bilingue qui pourrait parler au sujet de l'autisme et qu'au d\u00e9but de d\u00e9cembre 2001, on lui a donn\u00e9 le nom de Mme Nathalie Poirier. Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que Mme Poirier aide les personnes \u00e0 Ottawa autant qu'\u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. La r\u00e9union devait avoir lieu le 14 janvier 2002.\n[162] Cependant, le dossier d\u00e9montre qu'une premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union avec Mme Poirier a eu lieu \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al avant le 14 janvier 2002. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la r\u00e9union avait \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e par Mme Demers, directrice des Ressources humaines. Mme Daoust, qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la r\u00e9union de Montr\u00e9al, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que tous les gestionnaires des ressources humaines \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la r\u00e9union de Montr\u00e9al, mais qu'aucun membre du syndicat n'y \u00e9tait. D'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Boucher, l'objectif de la r\u00e9union \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer si Mme Poirier \u00e9tait la bonne sp\u00e9cialiste. Mme Boucher a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Demers l'avait rappel\u00e9e afin de l'aviser que Mme Poirier \u00e9tait une sp\u00e9cialiste ad\u00e9quate.\n[163] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union \u00e9tait que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes devait traiter avec une personne autiste, que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait mal \u00e9quip\u00e9e pour le faire et qu'elle ne comprenait pas comment interagir avec cette personne. Selon Mme Daoust, les participants ont pu poser des questions et Mme Poirier leur a expliqu\u00e9 comment une personne autiste fonctionne et leur a fourni des conseils sur la fa\u00e7on d'interagir avec Mme Dawson, par exemple raccrocher le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone si elle parlait trop. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, la premi\u00e8re fois que Mme Poirier est venue \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, elle ne savait pas que la personne en question \u00e9tait Mme Dawson. Cependant, selon Mme Daoust, pendant la r\u00e9union, le nom de Mme Dawson a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 et Mme Poirier a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu connaissance de son dossier et qu'elle connaissait tr\u00e8s bien Mme Dawson.\n[164] Mme Boucher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, au sujet de la r\u00e9union qui devait avoir lieu \u00e0 Ottawa, que les personnes qui seraient invit\u00e9es \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la r\u00e9union \u00e9taient les personnes qui avaient, \u00e0 ce moment, le plus de communications avec Mme Dawson et qui avaient de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer avec elle. Mme Boucher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au d\u00e9part, seuls les gestionnaires devaient \u00eatre invit\u00e9s et qu'apr\u00e8s une r\u00e9union impr\u00e9vue avec un repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat, on a pris la d\u00e9cision d'inviter des repr\u00e9sentants du syndicat. Mme Boucher a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Lafleur lui avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 quelques jours avant la r\u00e9union qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 Ottawa, afin de demander une copie du CV de Mme Poirier, qu'elle lui a envoy\u00e9e. M. Lafleur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas inhabituel pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes d'organiser des r\u00e9unions o\u00f9 on discutait de questions en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[165] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que le 14 janvier 2002, une r\u00e9union a eu lieu \u00e0 Ottawa \u00e0 laquelle participaient des repr\u00e9sentants du Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes (des niveaux national, r\u00e9gionaux et locaux), des repr\u00e9sentants de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et Mme Nathalie Poirier. Le dossier d\u00e9montre que parmi les participants \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 14 janvier 2002 se trouvaient M. Lafleur, un repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat, sept ou huit personnes du Programme d'aide aux employ\u00e9s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, Huguette Demers, de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, ainsi que sept ou huit autres employ\u00e9s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. D'apr\u00e8s M. Lafleur, l'objectif de la r\u00e9union \u00e9tait d'obtenir plus de renseignements sur l'autisme, de mieux comprendre ce qu'\u00e9tait l'autisme et quelles en \u00e9taient les implications ainsi que de faire avancer le dossier de Mme Dawson.\n[166] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Boucher a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les organisateurs de la r\u00e9union ont tenu compte du besoin de ne pas parler d'un cas particulier et d'avoir plut\u00f4t une s\u00e9ance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. M. Lafleur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au cours de la r\u00e9union comme telle, il n'y a eu aucune discussion au sujet de Mme Dawson et de sa situation \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Cependant, Mme Boucher a reconnu en contre-interrogatoire que la r\u00e9union portait sur la fa\u00e7on de mieux communiquer avec Mme Dawson. Mme Boucher a aussi reconnu que cet objectif n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint \u00e0 la r\u00e9union.\n[167] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Lafleur, il semble que le syndicat ait tent\u00e9 de nombreuses fois de faire participer Mme Dawson \u00e0 la r\u00e9union, sans succ\u00e8s. Finalement, le syndicat et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes ont convenu de tenir la r\u00e9union \u00e0 Ottawa, sans la pr\u00e9sence de Mme Dawson. Celle-ci n'a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 14 janvier 2002 \u00e0 Ottawa. M. Lafleur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il croyait qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es soient invit\u00e9es \u00e0 ces s\u00e9ances de renseignement, mais que ce n'\u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas le cas.\n[168] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que Mme Poirier a distribu\u00e9 des copies papier de sa pr\u00e9sentation aux participants. M. Lafleur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 interloqu\u00e9 par ce que Mme Poirier a dit au sujet de l'autisme. D'apr\u00e8s M. Lafleur, les commentaires de Mme Poirier portaient sur le fait que les personnes autistes \u00e9taient \u00e9go\u00efstes et qu'elles n'avaient aucun sentiment. Personne n'a contredit le t\u00e9moignage de M. Lafleur. Quant \u00e0 elle, Mme Boucher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9sentation comptait des bons renseignements et qu'elle donnait un peu plus d'information aux participants au sujet de l'autisme. Lorsqu'on examine la copie papier que Mme Poirier a distribu\u00e9e aux participants, le contenu met plus d'importance sur les c\u00f4t\u00e9s n\u00e9gatifs de l'autisme que sur les c\u00f4t\u00e9s positifs.\n[169] Le dossier pr\u00e9cise que le 15 janvier 2002, M. Lafleur a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Mme Mary Traversy, gestionnaire des Relations industrielles, lorsqu'il a su que Mme Poirier connaissait personnellement Mme Dawson. Dans sa lettre, M. Lafleur d\u00e9clare qu'au d\u00e9but de la r\u00e9union, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Poirier ce qu'elle savait du dossier de Mme Dawson et que celle-ci lui avait r\u00e9pondu qu'elle n'avait aucune connaissance du dossier et qu'elle participait \u00e0 la r\u00e9union afin de tenter d'expliquer son point de vue sur l'autisme.\n[170] M. Lafleur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsque Mme Dawson a su que le syndicat s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union d'Ottawa, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 contrari\u00e9e, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'elle a compris que la personne qui faisait la pr\u00e9sentation sur l'autisme \u00e9tait Mme Poirier, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sa psychologue par le pass\u00e9. Dans une deuxi\u00e8me lettre envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Traversy, dat\u00e9e du 16 janvier 2002, M. Lafleur a \u00e9crit qu'il ne pouvait pas croire que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait tendu une embuscade au syndicat de cette fa\u00e7on, en sachant tr\u00e8s bien quelles r\u00e9percussions cette r\u00e9union aurait sur Mme Dawson.\n[171] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si, \u00e0 tout moment avant la r\u00e9union, Mme Boucher savait que Mme Poirier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la psychologue de Mme Dawson, elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne le savait pas et que si elle l'avait appris, elle aurait cherch\u00e9 un autre expert en autisme. Le Tribunal n'a aucune raison de ne pas croire Mme Boucher. Le dossier d\u00e9montre que Mme Poirier a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9primand\u00e9e par son ordre professionnel.\n[172] La preuve semble d\u00e9montrer aussi que Mme Dawson \u00e9tait la seule personne autiste qui travaillait \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. M. Lafleur a confirm\u00e9 cette hypoth\u00e8se en d\u00e9clarant qu'il croyait qu'il n'y avait aucune autre personne autiste qui travaillait \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes \u00e0 ce moment.\n[173] Compte tenu de la preuve, le Tribunal conclut qu'avant la r\u00e9union du 14 janvier 2002, la gestion de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes ne savait pas que Mme Poirier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la psychologue de Mme Dawson et n'en avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e. Le Tribunal conclut aussi que la r\u00e9union qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue \u00e0 Ottawa le 14 janvier 2002 avait un objectif double : fournir des renseignements sur l'autisme afin de mieux communiquer avec Mme Dawson. Le Tribunal conclut aussi que les renseignements que Mme Poirier a fournis \u00e0 la r\u00e9union n'ont probablement pas communiqu\u00e9 le bon message au sujet de l'autisme et qu'ils n'ont pas aid\u00e9 \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer les relations entre Mme Dawson et les gestionnaires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes.\n[174] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 14 janvier 2002, la plaignante et la Commission n'ont pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, de repr\u00e9sailles ou de harc\u00e8lement. Ni la Commission, ni Mme Dawson n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal des preuves mat\u00e9rielles qui d\u00e9montraient que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait embauch\u00e9 Mme Poirier en vue de faire preuve de discrimination envers Mme Dawson fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience, en vue d'user de repr\u00e9sailles contre elle parce qu'elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, ou en vue de la harceler. La preuve d\u00e9montre qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, la gestion de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes cherchait des experts externes afin de mieux comprendre comment composer avec Mme Dawson et qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de relations professionnelles ant\u00e9rieures qui avaient exist\u00e9 entre Mme Dawson et Mme Poirier.\nc) L'accident de travail [175] Dans son formulaire de plainte, Mme Dawson d\u00e9clare qu'apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union du 14 janvier 2002 et apr\u00e8s sa d\u00e9claration d'accident de travail subs\u00e9quent valid\u00e9, le harc\u00e8lement dont elle \u00e9tait victime s'est aggrav\u00e9, les membres de l'intim\u00e9e l'ont attaqu\u00e9e verbalement et l'ont menac\u00e9e agressivement. Elle soutient aussi que lorsque les actions de l'intim\u00e9e ont menac\u00e9 sa sant\u00e9, sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et sa vie, le STTP ainsi que ses docteurs ont intervenu par \u00e9crit. Elle ajoute aussi que l'intim\u00e9e a maintenu la menace de la forcer \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation psychologique, un supplice qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9vastateur pour elle puisqu'elle est autiste, et que c'est ce que l'intim\u00e9e tentait de faire. Mme Dawson mentionne aussi que Richard Paradis, l'agent des relations de travail de l'intim\u00e9e au Qu\u00e9bec, a fait des remarques au cours d'un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec le STTP, le 4 mars 2002, selon lesquelles elle ne ferait que se mutiler quelques fois de plus, insultant ainsi Mme Dawson et se moquant de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[176] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'accident de travail que Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en janvier 2002, le Tribunal a entendu des t\u00e9moignages de Mme Dawson et de Mme Daoust. Le Dr Piette, un m\u00e9decin de Medisys, qui devait t\u00e9moigner, selon la liste des t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[177] Le dossier d\u00e9montre qu'apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union du 14 janvier 2002 \u00e0 Ottawa, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 un accident de travail fond\u00e9 sur le harc\u00e8lement le 30 janvier 2002 \u00e0 la CSST, indiquant que la date de l'accident \u00e9tait le 14 janvier 2002. Le dossier d\u00e9montre que le rapport m\u00e9dical attestant de cet accident \u00e9tait sign\u00e9 par la Dre K., m\u00e9decin de Mme Dawson. La Dre K. \u00e9crit dans son rapport : [traduction] victime de harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail. R\u00e9action d'adaptation li\u00e9e au stress. Diagnostic : Incapable de retourner au travail.\n[178] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que Mme Dawson est retourn\u00e9e au travail le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2002. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de retourner au travail parce qu'elle avait peur, pas parce qu'elle se sentait en sant\u00e9, et qu'\u00e0 son retour au travail, elle n'\u00e9tait pas en bon \u00e9tat mais elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire son travail.\n[179] Dans un rapport sign\u00e9 par la Dre K. et dat\u00e9 du 5 f\u00e9vrier 2002, la docteure \u00e9crit : [traduction] la patiente est \u00e9motionnellement fragile. [illisible] elle croit que [...] doit retourner au travail en raison d'un harc\u00e8lement continu. Le dossier d\u00e9montre aussi que le m\u00eame jour, la Dre K. a inscrit sur une note de prescription : [traduction] Pour faciliter la communication, il serait utile que Mme Dawson puisse enregistrer toutes ses conversations avec la gestion.\n[180] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait re\u00e7u, apr\u00e8s que Mme Dawson ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son accident de travail, la demande de l'employ\u00e9e remplie par la Dre K. (Formulaire 1940) et la lettre du Dr M. dat\u00e9e du 24 janvier 2002, toutes deux dans la m\u00eame enveloppe. En ce qui a trait au rapport de la Dre K., Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce qui a retenu son attention \u00e9tait la mention la patiente est fragile \u00e9motionnellement. Ce que Mme Daoust a compris de cette remarque, c'est que Mme Dawson n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 revenir au travail. Mme Daoust craignait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque que Mme Dawson reviendrait au travail alors qu'elle \u00e9tait toujours bless\u00e9e et que son \u00e9tat s'aggraverait.\n[181] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que dans sa lettre, le Dr M. d\u00e9clare que la lettre refl\u00e8te le contenu d'une rencontre qui a eu lieu le 4 avril 2001. Il d\u00e9clare aussi qu'il a rendu un diagnostic d'autisme au sujet de Mme Dawson, qui a une intelligence sup\u00e9rieure et qu'elle a une d\u00e9pression chronique li\u00e9e \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes d'adaptation en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Le Dr M. poursuit en expliquant que Mme Dawson a un bon jugement, une bonne id\u00e9e de son \u00e9tat, qu'elle est lucide et capable de prendre des d\u00e9cisions par elle-m\u00eame, qu'elle est capable de parler de son \u00e9tat et qu'aucune d\u00e9cision au sujet de son \u00e9tat ne devrait \u00eatre prise sans son consentement. Il convient de noter que cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite apr\u00e8s la conf\u00e9rence qui a eu lieu \u00e0 Ottawa le 14 janvier 2002, mais avant que Mme Dawson d\u00e9clare son accident de travail le 30 janvier 2002.\n[182] Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s qu'elle a re\u00e7u les documents portant sur la d\u00e9claration de Mme Dawson, elle a re\u00e7u un appel de celle-ci. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Dawson \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par la mention [traduction] d\u00e9pression chronique dans le certificat m\u00e9dical.\n[183] Au cours du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Daoust, Mme Dawson lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer ce que le Dr M. avait \u00e0 voir avec l'accident (absence pour accident professionnel), compte tenu que la lettre du Dr M. ne comprenait aucune mention d'un accident de travail et qu'elle d\u00e9coulait d'un rendez-vous que Mme Dawson avait eu avec lui environ 9 mois avant que la lettre soit \u00e9crite et que l'accident de travail se produise. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, selon elle, la lettre n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'accident, mais qu'elle fournissait des renseignements au sujet de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de Mme Dawson.\n[184] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a expliqu\u00e9 que la lettre du 25 janvier 2002 du Dr M. \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 titre de certificat de diagnostic parce que la demande \u00e0 la CSST portait sur du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur une d\u00e9ficience et que Mme Dawson se sentait oblig\u00e9e d'\u00e9tablir son diagnostic par une lettre venant du Dr M. Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, et la preuve d\u00e9montre, qu'avant de donner la permission \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes de communiquer avec le Dr M., elle voulait s'assurer de la raison pour laquelle cela \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire et pertinent compte tenu de la nature de sa d\u00e9claration. Mme Dawson \u00e9tait d'avis que le Dr M. ne savait rien au sujet de l'accident de travail et qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris qu'on communique avec lui.\n[185] Le dossier indique qu'apr\u00e8s que Mme Dawson a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa d\u00e9claration \u00e0 la CSST, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a entrepris une enqu\u00eate interne sur l'all\u00e9gation d'harc\u00e8lement. \u00c0 la fin de l'enqu\u00eate, apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 avec les superviseurs de la succursale postale de Pierrefonds, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a conclu qu'il n'y avait eu aucun harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 la succursale postale de Pierrefonds, mais que l'all\u00e9gation portait sur la r\u00e9union d'Ottawa.\n[186] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a exig\u00e9 que Mme Dawson se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale aupr\u00e8s d'un m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que m\u00eame si Mme Dawson \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9e au travail le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2002, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes voulait obtenir un avis d'expert ou une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale sur l'\u00e9tat de sa sant\u00e9 pour deux raisons qui, d'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust \u00e9taient : 1. la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes ne croyait pas que Mme Dawson avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement; 2. dans chaque cas o\u00f9 il y a une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement, l'employeur demande une \u00e9valuation ou une expertise. Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en raison du contenu du rapport \u00e9crit par la Dre K., selon lequel Mme Dawson \u00e9tait fragile, mais qu'elle pensait \u00eatre capable de revenir au travail, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes croyait qu'un deuxi\u00e8me avis \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire afin de d\u00e9terminer si elle \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat de revenir au travail, m\u00eame si Mme Dawson \u00e9tait revenue au travail le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2002. Mme Daoust a expliqu\u00e9 que la blessure de Mme Dawson n'\u00e9tait pas physique et que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes souhaitait savoir si son \u00e9tat mental lui permettait de revenir au travail, puisque l'accident \u00e9tait d\u00e9crit comme du harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail.\n[187] \u00c0 ce sujet, Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son accident, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nombreuses raisons pour lesquelles elle devrait se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation d'expert, y compris sa d\u00e9pression ant\u00e9rieure et une hernie qu'elle avait eue plus t\u00f4t dans sa carri\u00e8re. Mme Dawson a not\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le formulaire rempli par la Dre K. ne mentionnait ni la d\u00e9pression ni l'hernie, qui sont deux \u00e9tats qui n'ont rien \u00e0 voir avec son accident de travail. Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son accident de travail n'\u00e9tait pas du tout reli\u00e9 \u00e0 sa d\u00e9pression. Elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle ne savait pas \u00e0 quoi servirait l'expertise ou pourquoi la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes souhaitait obtenir cette expertise et, en fait, on lui a dit qu'elle devait voir un sp\u00e9cialiste au sujet de son hernie et de sa d\u00e9pression, qui n'\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 son accident de travail du moment.\n[188] Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le superviseur de Mme Dawson lui a demand\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une clinique afin de subir l'\u00e9valuation. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la demande que Mme Dawson se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale effectu\u00e9e par un m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e avait des r\u00e9percussions dramatiques sur Mme Dawson. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, Mme Dawson lui a dit qu'elle ne pouvait pas aller voir un m\u00e9decin qu'elle ne connaissait pas et que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes n'avait aucun droit de lui demander.\n[189] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait deux pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de l'exigence qu'elle se soumette \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical : 1. devoir voir un m\u00e9decin qui n'existait pas; 2. vouloir des renseignements sur la fa\u00e7on de remplir un certificat m\u00e9dical. Mme Dawson ne comprenait pas pourquoi on la critiquait aussi vivement \u00e0 cause de cela et elle se demandait ce qu'elle avait fait d'aussi mal. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Schetagne, parce qu'elle voulait ces renseignements, c'est-\u00e0-dire la fa\u00e7on de remplir un certificat m\u00e9dical, l'a accus\u00e9e d'harceler Mme Leroux, une de ses superviseurs.\n[190] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas l'intention de voir un m\u00e9decin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes apr\u00e8s toutes les atteintes \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e dont elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait communiqu\u00e9 avec ses m\u00e9decins sans sa permission et avait embauch\u00e9 sa psychologue). Elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 voir un m\u00e9decin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes qui n'avait probablement aucune exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re d'autisme. Elle craignait qu'un m\u00e9decin qui n'avait aucune exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re d'autisme tirerait n'importe quelle conclusion. Elle a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que la gestion la terrifiait.\n[191] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le 1er mars 2002, Donald Lafleur, un repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat, l'a avis\u00e9e qu'on lui donnerait une lettre le 5 mars 2002 pour la forcer \u00e0 aller voir un m\u00e9decin pay\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes sans lui donner de raison. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait pas croire que son employeur allait la forcer \u00e0 voir un m\u00e9decin. Le dossier d\u00e9montre qu'on a donn\u00e9 cette lettre \u00e0 Mme Dawson le 7 mars 2002.\n[192] Le dossier indique que le 4 mars 2002, la Dre K. a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 qui de droit au sujet de Mme Dawson. La lettre indiquait que Mme Dawson est une patiente que la Dre K. suit depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es pour des soins m\u00e9dicaux g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, qu'on l'avait avis\u00e9e que Mme Dawson devait se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical aupr\u00e8s d'un sp\u00e9cialiste et que Mme Dawson \u00e9tait d'avis qu'on la for\u00e7ait \u00e0 le faire et que cela constituait du harc\u00e8lement de la part de son employeur. La Dre K. a poursuivi en d\u00e9clarant qu'\u00e0 ce moment, l'\u00e9tat mental de Mme Dawson \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s fragile et qu'\u00e0 titre de m\u00e9decin, elle s'inqui\u00e9tait que cela puisse provoquer une r\u00e9action \u00e9motionnelle s\u00e9rieuse chez Mme Dawson.\n[193] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que le 4 mars 2002, le Dr M. a aussi \u00e9crit une lettre. Dans cette lettre, il d\u00e9clare que Mme Dawson est tout \u00e0 fait capable de travailler et de prendre des d\u00e9cisions par elle-m\u00eame. Il recommande qu'on consulte Mme Dawson avant de prendre une quelconque d\u00e9cision \u00e0 son sujet et qu'elle ne doit pas \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 des changements brusques et inexpliqu\u00e9s au sujet de son travail. Le Dr M. d\u00e9clare que ce type d'accommodement est aussi vital que l'adaptation des trottoirs afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des personnes en chaise roulante ou que l'\u00e9largissement du format d'une police de caract\u00e8re pour les personnes qui ont des d\u00e9ficiences visuelles.\n[194] Le dossier pr\u00e9cise que le 4 mars 2002, M. Pierre Contant, le directeur national du syndicat pour la r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al, a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Mme Huguette Demers, directrice des Ressources humaines. Mme Dawson a re\u00e7u une copie conforme de la lettre. Dans cette lettre, M. Contant exprime sa consternation au sujet de l'entrevue qui devait avoir lieu le 5 mars 2002 avec M. Potvin visant \u00e0 forcer Mme Dawson \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical. M. Contant a exprim\u00e9 sa d\u00e9sapprobation envers cette proc\u00e9dure.\n[195] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que le 6 mars 2002, M. Christian Potvin, un surintendant d'unit\u00e9 \u00e0 la succursale postale de Pierrefonds, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Dawson afin de l'aviser qu'en raison de son absence pour cause de blessure au travail du 31 janvier 2002 au 5 f\u00e9vrier 2002 et des certificats m\u00e9dicaux qu'elle a soumis \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes afin de justifier cette absence, en raison de son retour sans consolidation et en vertu de l'article 212 de Loi sur les accidents du travail et les maladies professionnelles, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes aurait le droit d'exiger qu'elle se soumette \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante. M. Potvin poursuit en expliquant que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes serait pr\u00eate \u00e0 suivre une autre approche en ajoutant une mesure \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure r\u00e9glementaire, si Mme Dawson permettait au Dr Piette, le m\u00e9decin retenu par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, de communiquer avec la Dre K. et le Dr M. afin d'obtenir les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux requis.\n[196] D'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Daoust, cette autre solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e parce qu'il semblait qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile pour Mme Dawson d'\u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 un m\u00e9decin qu'elle ne connaissait pas, dans un environnement qui ne lui \u00e9tait pas familier. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle habituelle. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle l'avait fait en raison des pr\u00e9occupations que Mme Dawson avait exprim\u00e9es.\n[197] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, Mme Dawson a refus\u00e9 de permettre au Dr Piette de communiquer avec ses m\u00e9decins. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que si apr\u00e8s avoir communiqu\u00e9 avec les m\u00e9decins de Mme Dawson, le m\u00e9decin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il avait les renseignements dont il avait besoin, Mme Dawson n'aurait pas eu \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale.\n[198] La preuve d\u00e9montre que la raison pour laquelle Mme Dawson n'a pas donn\u00e9 la permission \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes de communiquer avec le Dr M. \u00e9tait qu'elle ne voyait aucun lien entre le harc\u00e8lement dont elle s'\u00e9tait plainte et le Dr M. Cependant, le m\u00e9decin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il \u00e9tait pertinent de communiquer avec le Dr M., compte tenu de la note qu'il avait envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Daoust au m\u00eame moment o\u00f9 la d\u00e9claration d'accident de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que cette note avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme un document qui appuyait certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l'accident de travail.\n[199] Mme Daoust a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Dawson avait jusqu'au 11 mars 2002 pour prendre une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 savoir si le Dr Piette pouvait communiquer avec ses m\u00e9decins. Le dossier d\u00e9montre que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, compte tenu du refus de Mme Dawson de permettre au Dr Piette de communiquer avec ses m\u00e9decins (le Dr M. et la Dre K.), a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le 11 mars 2002 d'envoyer Mme Dawson \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation ind\u00e9pendante, qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue le 15 mars 2002.\n[200] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, le fait d'envoyer un employ\u00e9 pour qu'il subisse un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant, lorsque la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait des doutes au sujet de son \u00e9tat m\u00e9dical, \u00e9tait une proc\u00e9dure normale. En fait, Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait fait une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle dans le cas de Mme Dawson en tentant d'abord d'obtenir les renseignements dont elle avait besoin aupr\u00e8s de ses m\u00e9decins traitants.\n[201] Mme Dawson a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Daoust s'il \u00e9tait de pratique commune de communiquer avec un m\u00e9decin qui n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec l'accident de travail. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une proc\u00e9dure qui n'\u00e9tait pas habituelle, qu'en fait la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes proposait une mesure de rechange afin que Mme Dawson n'ait pas \u00e0 suivre la proc\u00e9dure normale pr\u00e9vue par la Loi, c'est-\u00e0-dire se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation par un m\u00e9decin qu'elle ne connaissait pas dans un environnement inconnu.\n[202] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que le 11 mars 2002, Mme Louise Leroux, une superviseure \u00e0 la succursale postale de Pierrefonds, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Dawson pour l'aviser qu'elle avait un rendez-vous avec le Dr Jocelyn Audet pour une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale tenue conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 211 de la Loi sur les accidents du travail et les maladies professionnelles. L'\u00e9valuation devait avoir lieu le 12 mars 2002 au Groupe Sant\u00e9 Medisys \u00e0 8 h. La lettre pr\u00e9cise que l'objet de l'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante \u00e9tait de trancher les cinq questions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l'article 212 de la Loi.\n[203] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la demande du 11 mars 2002, Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Dawson avait exprim\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations. Mme Daoust a reconnu qu'il y avait une erreur au sujet du nom du m\u00e9decin. Le nom du m\u00e9decin \u00e9tait Aubut plut\u00f4t qu'Audet. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Dawson ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au rendez-vous du 11 mars 2002 compte tenu de la confusion au sujet du nom du m\u00e9decin. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'un autre rendez-vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu, mais que Mme Dawson avait refus\u00e9 de s'y pr\u00e9senter.\n[204] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'on lui a donn\u00e9 la lettre de Mme Leroux le 12 mars 2002. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Leroux l'avait menac\u00e9e avec force et lui avait dit qu'elle subirait des mesures disciplinaires si elle refusait de voir le m\u00e9decin. Mme Leroux n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[205] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le 13 mars 2002, Mme Louise Leroux lui a dit que le Dr Audet \u00e9tait un psychiatre. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Dawson, m\u00eame si elle avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le Dr Audet \u00e9tait un psychiatre, Mme Leroux a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le rendez-vous portait sur son hernie (que Mme Dawson avait eue un an plus t\u00f4t) et sur sa d\u00e9pression, deux \u00e9tats qui n'avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec l'accident d\u00e9clar\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail.\n[206] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait appel\u00e9 Medisys afin de poser des questions au sujet du Dr Audet. On lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'existait aucun Dr Audet, mais qu'il y avait bien un Dr Aubut. Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait confuse, puisqu'on l'avait menac\u00e9e de prendre des mesures disciplinaires si elle n'acceptait pas de voir un m\u00e9decin qui n'existait pas.\n[207] Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la recherche sur Internet qu'elle a faite au sujet du Dr Jocelyn Aubut a indiqu\u00e9 que celui-ci \u00e9tait un psychiatre associ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Institut Pinel \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, qui est un h\u00f4pital psychiatrique o\u00f9 des personnes qui ont eu un comportement criminel sont incarc\u00e9r\u00e9es ou renvoy\u00e9es. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas un sp\u00e9cialiste en autisme.\n[208] \u00c0 ce sujet, Mme Dawson a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve les documents qu'elle avait obtenus sur Internet et qui d\u00e9montraient que l'expertise du Dr Aubut portait sur les personnes dangereuses. Elle a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui de cet argument un extrait de document dans lequel le Dr Aubut est cit\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant l'un des auteurs d'un article intitul\u00e9 Un inventaire pour l'\u00e9valuation de la dangerosit\u00e9 psychiatrique. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e s'est oppos\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces documents, d\u00e9clarant qu'ils ne prouvaient rien au sujet de la personne qu'\u00e9tait le Dr Aubut.\n[209] Le Tribunal est d'avis que la preuve soutient les arguments de Mme Dawson selon lesquels le Dr Aubut n'est pas un sp\u00e9cialiste en autisme, qu'il est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Institut Pinel de Montr\u00e9al et que son domaine de sp\u00e9cialisation est principalement li\u00e9 au comportement criminel et \u00e0 la violence. Sauf pour l'objection au sujet de la preuve documentaire de Mme Dawson, l'intim\u00e9e n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve qui contredisait l'argument de Mme Dawson au sujet du Dr Aubut. Le Tribunal conclut que les arguments de Mme Dawson ainsi que son t\u00e9moignage et ses connaissances de la collectivit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale qui a des connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es au sujet de l'autisme sont cr\u00e9dibles.\n[210] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que le 13 mars 2002, M. Donald Lafleur, un repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent lors de la r\u00e9union du 14 janvier 2002, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mary Traversy, gestionnaire des Relations industrielles \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Dans sa lettre, il rappelle l'objection du syndicat au fait que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes voulait envoyer Mme Dawson \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale. Le dossier d\u00e9montre aussi qu'on a dit \u00e0 Mme Dawson, le 25 mars, que le rendez-vous m\u00e9dical qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 \u00e9tait report\u00e9 au 28 mars 2002.\n[211] Le dossier d\u00e9montre aussi que le 14 juin 2002, la CSST a rendu une d\u00e9cision au sujet de la d\u00e9claration de harc\u00e8lement de Mme Dawson. La lettre qui informe Mme Dawson du r\u00e8glement mentionne les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d'octobre 1999 qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une plainte devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et au r\u00e8glement subs\u00e9quent. Il est indiqu\u00e9 dans la lettre que, compte tenu de la r\u00e9union du 14 janvier 2002, des \u00e9v\u00e9nements mentionn\u00e9s dans deux lettres \u00e9crites par le syndicat, du fait qu'une deuxi\u00e8me fois, un psychologue qui connaissait Mme Dawson a \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9 par le syndicat et l'employeur, de la d\u00e9ficience cognitive d\u00e9crite dans la lettre du Dr M. du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2002 et du fait que Mme Dawson a \u00e9t\u00e9 factrice pendant 13 ans sans aucun probl\u00e8me, la CSST a conclu que Mme Dawson avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un accident du travail le 14 janvier 2002, qui avait entra\u00een\u00e9 un d\u00e9ficit d'adaptation.\n[212] Apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la CSST, il semble que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas envoyer Mme Dawson \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale pr\u00e9vue avec le Dr Aubut. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a conclu que, pour une absence de quatre jours, il ne valait pas la peine, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie et \u00e0 l'argent d\u00e9pens\u00e9s, de poursuivre l'examen. Il s'agissait d'une d\u00e9cision d'ordre op\u00e9rationnelle, d'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust.\n[213] Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson est souvent revenue sur son commentaire portant sur le fait que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a continu\u00e9 de menacer de l'envoyer \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical jusqu'en juin 2002 et que le syndicat avait aussi envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 Mme Traversy.\n[214] \u00c0 ce sujet, Mme Dawson a pos\u00e9 la question pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 Mme Daoust \u00e0 savoir s'il \u00e9tait raisonnable pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes de maintenir la menace d'examen m\u00e9dical, compte tenu de la lettre que la Dre K. avait envoy\u00e9e le 4 mars 2002, dans laquelle elle d\u00e9clarait qu'un tel examen serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 Mme Dawson. Mme Daoust a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] je ne peux pas dire et elle a mentionn\u00e9 le fait que l'une des raisons \u00e9tait que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes tentait de communiquer avec le m\u00e9decin de Mme Dawson.\n[215] Le Tribunal conclut que, compte tenu des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l'affaire, l'intim\u00e9e, par les actions de ses employ\u00e9s, n'a pas garanti \u00e0 la plaignante un environnement de travail libre de tout harc\u00e8lement. Le Tribunal conclut que, m\u00eame compte tenu des pr\u00e9occupations importantes que le m\u00e9decin traitant de Mme Dawson et que ses repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux ont exprim\u00e9es, l'intim\u00e9e a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 exiger une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale effectu\u00e9e par le m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes.\n[216] En effet, la preuve d\u00e9montre que l'intim\u00e9e est rest\u00e9e sourde aux demandes de Mme Dawson, qui ne souhaitait pas voir un m\u00e9decin qu'elle ne connaissait pas et qui n'avait aucune connaissance au sujet de l'autisme, de ses repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux, qui avaient exprim\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations et de la consternation au sujet du fait que Mme Dawson devait se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical aupr\u00e8s d'un m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, mais de fa\u00e7on plus importante, de son m\u00e9decin traitant, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle craignait s\u00e9rieusement que cela provoquerait une [traduction] r\u00e9action \u00e9motionnelle grave chez Mme Dawson.\n[217] Pourtant, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a tout de m\u00eame continu\u00e9 \u00e0 pousser Mme Dawson \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical aupr\u00e8s d'un m\u00e9decin qu'elle ne connaissait pas, qui savait que Mme Dawson \u00e9tait autiste et qui n'avait pas de connaissance sur l'autisme. Il convient de noter que Mme Daoust a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que le fait de demander \u00e0 Mme Dawson de se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale avait eu des [traduction] r\u00e9percussions dramatiques sur cette derni\u00e8re.\n[218] Le comble, c'est que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Dawson de rencontrer un m\u00e9decin qui, selon la preuve, n'est pas un expert en autisme, mais selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, il est un psychiatre sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans les comportements violents. Le dossier d\u00e9montre que Mme Dawson a d\u00fb vivre avec la menace d'avoir \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical pendant trois mois, c'est-\u00e0-dire de mars \u00e0 juin 2002.\n[219] Peu importe les bonnes intentions de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes lorsqu'elle a demand\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale, le Tribunal conclut que, dans les circonstances, le comportement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des employ\u00e9s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes qui ont particip\u00e9 au processus de l'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale constitue du harc\u00e8lement. Le comportement r\u00e9pond aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans la jurisprudence en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ce que constitue du harc\u00e8lement, notamment la d\u00e9cision Hill, dans laquelle le Tribunal a conclu que le harc\u00e8lement r\u00e9side essentiellement dans la cr\u00e9ation d'un climat de travail hostile qui porte atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 personnelle du plaignant, et dans la d\u00e9cision Marinaki, dans laquelle le Tribunal a exprim\u00e9 le point de vue selon lequel les victimes de harc\u00e8lement n'ont pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'elles ont souffert de pertes p\u00e9cuniaires et selon lequel, pour qu'un comportement devienne du harc\u00e8lement, il faudra g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une certaine r\u00e9p\u00e9tition ou persistance. Cela dit, l'article 65 de la Loi \u00e9tablit que l'intim\u00e9e est responsable des actes discriminatoires de ses employ\u00e9s, de ses mandataires ou de ses administrateurs.\n[220] Le Tribunal conclut donc que la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Dawson a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur important dans la fa\u00e7on dont l'intim\u00e9e l'a trait\u00e9e en ce qui a trait aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements susmentionn\u00e9s et que le comportement de l'intim\u00e9e constitue du harc\u00e8lement et contrevient \u00e0 l'article 14 de la Loi. Cependant, le Tribunal conclut qu'il n'y a aucune preuve concluante selon laquelle le comportement de l'intim\u00e9e et de ses employ\u00e9s constituait des repr\u00e9sailles.\n[221] Peut-on reprocher \u00e0 Mme Dawson d'avoir refus\u00e9 de permettre au m\u00e9decin de Medisys de communiquer avec ses m\u00e9decins? La suite d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9montre clairement un manque total de connaissances et de compr\u00e9hension de la part de la gestion de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes par rapport \u00e0 l'autisme et \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les personnes autistes traitent l'information. La preuve d\u00e9montre clairement que la pr\u00e9sentation de Mme Poirier en janvier 2002 n'a pas apport\u00e9 beaucoup de renseignements sur la fa\u00e7on d'interagir en milieu de travail avec les personnes qui sont autistes. En fait, la r\u00e9union d'Ottawa n'a laiss\u00e9 aucune le\u00e7on.\n(iv) L'enregistrement des conversations [222] Dans son formulaire de plainte, Mme Dawson d\u00e9clare qu'apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union du 14 janvier 2002, elle a demand\u00e9 un accommodement simple qui n'aurait caus\u00e9 aucun probl\u00e8me et aucun co\u00fbt \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire le droit d'enregistrer ses conversations avec la gestion. Mme Dawson soutient que cette mesure \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire parce qu'elle ne traite pas l'information des conversations de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que les personnes qui ne sont pas autistes.\n[223] Mme Dawson soutient aussi que de septembre 2001 au 9 mai 2002, on lui a refus\u00e9 cet accommodement et que pendant une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique le 9 mai 2002, M. Raymond Poirier, gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations pour le Qu\u00e9bec, lui a dit qu'on lui refusait cet accommodement parce que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes n'aimait pas cette demande. Mme Dawson poursuit en expliquant que ce commentaire d\u00e9montre de l'intol\u00e9rance envers elle en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, qu'elle ne se sentait pas bienvenue et qu'on faisait preuve de m\u00e9pris envers elle parce qu'elle souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience. Enfin, Mme Dawson d\u00e9clare que lorsqu'on lui a permis d'enregistrer les conversations en juin 2002, des conditions non fond\u00e9es et d\u00e9gradantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9es \u00e0 l'accommodement qui co\u00efncidaient avec l'opinion que l'intim\u00e9e avait de l'autisme.\n[224] Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 enregistrer des conversations \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes en mai 1999, peu de temps apr\u00e8s qu'elle ait mentionn\u00e9 son diagnostic. Elle le faisait avec la connaissance et la permission de la gestion. Mme Dawson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, elle avait simplement avis\u00e9 la gestion que c'est ce qu'elle allait faire et lorsqu'elle enregistrait des conversations, elle le faisait de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, personne ne lui a demand\u00e9 de cesser de le faire ou de fournir des documents m\u00e9dicaux. Mme Dawson a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que c'est seulement lorsque l'environnement devient hostile qu'il devient n\u00e9cessaire pour elle d'avoir un dossier pr\u00e9cis de ses propres mots et de ses propres actes.\n[225] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait cess\u00e9 d'enregistrer les conversations vers la fin 1999 ou au d\u00e9but 2000, mais qu'\u00e0 l'automne 2001, elle a demand\u00e9 la permission de recommencer \u00e0 enregistrer les conversations parce qu'elle croyait qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas sage de ne pas demander la permission. La preuve d\u00e9montre que le 30 septembre 2001, dans une lettre qu'elle a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Mary Traversy, gestionnaire, Relations industrielles \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, Mme Dawson demandait la permission, si elle en sentait le besoin, d'enregistrer ses interactions avec la gestion et elle a mentionn\u00e9 que, comme elle le faisait auparavant, elle aviserait toute personne concern\u00e9e du fait qu'elle enregistrait la conversation.\n[226] Le dossier d\u00e9montre qu'en d\u00e9cembre 2001, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une lettre que Mme Dawson lui avait envoy\u00e9e auparavant, Mme Mary Traversy a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 Mme Dawson dans laquelle elle indiquait que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes n'acceptait toujours pas sa demande d'enregistrer les conversations avec la gestion. Cependant, Mme Traversy a \u00e9crit qu'en guise de mesure d'accommodement, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes lui enverrait des explications \u00e9crites, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[227] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2002, la Dre K. a \u00e9crit sur un feuillet de prescription qu'afin de faciliter la communication, il serait utile de permettre \u00e0 Mme Dawson d'enregistrer toutes les conversations qu'elle avait avec la gestion. La preuve d\u00e9montre que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a bien re\u00e7u ce document.\n[228] Le dossier d\u00e9montre aussi que dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2002, le Dr M., en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une demande de Mme Dawson, souligne le besoin de Mme Dawson d'enregistrer les conversations qui ont lieu entre elle-m\u00eame et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Le Dr M. d\u00e9clare que Mme Dawson est vuln\u00e9rable \u00e0 la malveillance de ses pairs et qu'elle d\u00e9montre des r\u00e9actions \u00e9motionnelles intenses lorsque les gens ne respectent pas ce qu'ils ont dit ou qu'ils font des d\u00e9clarations qui ne correspondent pas \u00e0 la nature r\u00e9elle des choses. De plus, le Dr M. exprime l'opinion selon laquelle cette demande, si on l'acceptait, permettrait \u00e0 Mme Dawson de se fier \u00e0 la formulation exacte de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 une approximation. Enfin, le Dr M. d\u00e9clare qu'il est d'avis que cette demande est li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience cognitive de Mme Dawson et qu'on doit y r\u00e9pondre avec le m\u00eame respect dont on fait preuve envers les personnes qui ont une d\u00e9ficience mentale.\n[229] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a confirm\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations du Dr M. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle se fie \u00e0 l'aspect verbatim des choses et qu'il est difficile pour elle de se souvenir exactement des conversations. Mme Dawson a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle utilise l'information d'une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente qu'une personne qui n'est pas autiste. Pour elle, tous les renseignements sont importants et ils sont tous trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale.\n[230] Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses deux lettres \u00e0 Christian Potvin le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2002. Il semble que Mary Traversy \u00e0 Ottawa ainsi que M. Lafleur, un repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat, ont obtenu des copies de ces lettres.\n[231] Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait personnellement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d'autoriser l'accommodement que Mme Dawson demandait. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Daoust a expliqu\u00e9 comment les demandes d'accommodement \u00e9taient trait\u00e9es \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Lorsqu'une demande d'accommodement est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, elle est v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e par un m\u00e9decin chez Medisys afin d'\u00e9valuer si elle raisonnable. Mme Daoust a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la demande de Mme Dawson, les gestionnaires de la succursale postale de Pierrefonds \u00e9taient r\u00e9ticents \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e d'\u00eatre enregistr\u00e9s. Ils ne s'opposaient pas \u00e0 l'accommodement, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, cela explique pourquoi autant de temps s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant que Mme Dawson ait droit \u00e0 l'accommodement qu'elle demandait.\n[232] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, compte tenu des objections que la gestion locale avait exprim\u00e9es, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes voulait s'entretenir avec les m\u00e9decins de Mme Dawson afin de trouver un autre type d'accommodement, par exemple \u00e9crire ce qui se disait pendant une conversation. Selon Mme Daoust, Mme Dawson a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle avait deux certificats m\u00e9dicaux et qu'elle ne comprenait pas quel \u00e9tait le probl\u00e8me, malgr\u00e9 les explications que Mme Daoust lui avait donn\u00e9es au sujet des pr\u00e9occupations des superviseurs. Mme Daoust a expliqu\u00e9 que Mme Dawson \u00e9tait d'avis que c'\u00e9tait seulement en enregistrant une conversation qu'on pouvait en obtenir le ton et qu'un document \u00e9crit n'offrait pas la m\u00eame option.\n[233] Le dossier d\u00e9montre que le 23 mai 2002, Mme Dawson a autoris\u00e9 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes \u00e0 communiquer avec l'un de ses m\u00e9decins, le Dr M. Le Formulaire d'autorisation de divulgation des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux indique que Mme Dawson autorise le Dr M. \u00e0 discuter avec le m\u00e9decin de Medisys de l'utilisation d'un enregistreur afin de capter les conversations entre Mme Dawson et la gestion de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. La preuve laisse entendre que le retard dans la mise en place de la mesure d'accommodement a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la difficult\u00e9 que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a eue \u00e0 rejoindre le m\u00e9decin de Mme Dawson, par la demande de Mme Dawson de discuter de la question avec le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes ainsi que par les n\u00e9gociations avec la gestion locale.\n[234] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Potvin l'a finalement avis\u00e9e qu'on lui accorderait l'accommodement qu'elle demandait. Il semble que l'autorisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e en juin 2002.\n[235] Compte tenu de la preuve, le Tribunal conclut que la plaignante et la Commission n'ont pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination ou de repr\u00e9sailles. La preuve d\u00e9montre clairement que le retard par rapport \u00e0 la permission d'enregistrer les conversations entre Mme Dawson et la gestion d\u00e9coulait de la r\u00e9ticence de certains employ\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9s. Compte tenu des circonstances, le Tribunal conclut que l'intim\u00e9e devait composer avec les besoins de la plaignante par rapport aux pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es par certains de ses employ\u00e9s. Cela dit, les relations tendues entre Mme Dawson et la gestion de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes ne peuvent pas \u00eatre compl\u00e8tement exclues comme facteur qui a pu contribuer au retard.\nIV. R\u00c9PARATIONS [236] Dans ses observations finales, Mme Dawson d\u00e9clare, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question des r\u00e9parations :\n[traduction]\nComme on a conclu, t\u00f4t dans la proc\u00e9dure, que j'\u00e9tais d\u00e9raisonnable et non cr\u00e9dible et parce que pendant l'audience je ne pouvais pas fonctionner ad\u00e9quatement, et que parfois je ne pouvais pas fonctionner du tout, et que par cons\u00e9quent je ne comprenais pas les audiences, et pour d'autres raisons semblables qui ne sont pas li\u00e9es aux faits en l'affaire, je crois que l'argument est futile. Je sugg\u00e8re qu'on avise les autistes de rester loin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, \u00e0 moins qu'ils soient capables de cacher correctement leurs diff\u00e9rences et qu'ils soient certains que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'obtiendra jamais leur diagnostic, de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit. Il y avait une quantit\u00e9 impressionnante de preuves qui d\u00e9montraient que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 me causer du tort, de toutes les fa\u00e7ons possibles, dans mes interactions avec elle. Cela rend cr\u00e9dible ma demande que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes me laisse tranquille. Cependant, je ne suis pas dans une position qui me permet de demander des r\u00e9parations. Il semble inutile de tenir une proc\u00e9dure dans laquelle on refuse \u00e0 l'une des parties tout accommodement et que cette partie ne peut donc fonctionner que difficilement, ou pas du tout (et qu'elle est vue comme une personne qui d\u00e9pend sur la piti\u00e9, la charit\u00e9, etc., de ceux qu'on consid\u00e8re typiques ou raisonnables et qui ont donc droit \u00e0 des accommodements de plein droit). Il semble n'y avoir aucune r\u00e9paration pour cela.\n[237] Quant \u00e0 la Commission, elle d\u00e9clare :\n[traduction]\nLa r\u00e9paration la plus efficace que le Tribunal pourrait accorder serait d'ordonner que Mme Dawson soit r\u00e9install\u00e9e dans son travail d'une telle mani\u00e8re qui garantirait son retour fructueux \u00e0 un emploi productif et \u00e0 un travail qui, clairement, lui plaisait beaucoup et qui convenait \u00e0 ses capacit\u00e9s. La fa\u00e7on la plus efficace d'instaurer le changement et la tol\u00e9rance dans un milieu de travail est d'avoir l'agent de changement en milieu de travail tous les jours, avec les accommodements et les mesures de protection en place.\nCela dit, Mme Dawson n'a demand\u00e9 aucune r\u00e9paration pr\u00e9cise et le Tribunal ne peut pas imposer une telle r\u00e9paration pour elle. Cependant, Mme Dawson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en t\u00e9moignage qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable de penser \u00e0 l'avenir ou de supposer o\u00f9 elle serait aujourd'hui si la discrimination n'avait pas eu lieu. Elle a demand\u00e9 plusieurs fois qu'on la laisse tranquille et, de fa\u00e7on plus pr\u00e9cise, qu'on la garde sur la liste de paye \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9e de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et qu'on ne prenne aucune mesure visant \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Cela lui laisserait donc la porte ouverte si elle souhaitait retourner \u00e0 un emploi actif, si elle se sent capable de le faire \u00e0 l'avenir.\n[238] Le Tribunal est d'accord avec la Commission. Comme Mme Dawson n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner au travail, ni aucune autre forme de compensation, le Tribunal n'a pas la comp\u00e9tence de rendre une telle ordonnance. Il s'agit d'une question qui devra \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e entre Mme Dawson et l'intim\u00e9e.\n[239] De plus, dans ses observations finales, la Commission a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance pour que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes travaille avec la Commission afin de garantir que les pratiques et les comportements discriminatoires ne se poursuivent pas, en exigeant :\nque la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fournisse une copie de ses politiques existantes ou modifi\u00e9es portant sur le harc\u00e8lement, la discrimination et les accommodements dans les 30 jours suivant la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal; que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes travaille avec la Commission afin de modifier ses politiques existantes pour qu'elles soient conformes \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et au droit canadien en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, si la Commission d\u00e9termine que des modifications sont n\u00e9cessaires; que l'employeur, en consultant la Commission, embauche les personnes appropri\u00e9es pour tenir des s\u00e9ances en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9quit\u00e9, d'accommodement et de sensibilisation pour les gestionnaires et les employ\u00e9s; que l'employeur prenne les mesures additionnelles que la Commission juge appropri\u00e9es \u00e0 la situation.\nLe Tribunal accepte cette demande.\n[240] \u00c0 la fin de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Daoust a reconnu que c'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avait \u00e0 traiter avec un employ\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait autiste et, que selon toute probabilit\u00e9, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avait mal g\u00e9r\u00e9 l'affaire mais qu'enfin, elle avait appris de cette exp\u00e9rience.\n[241] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Daoust, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a pris diff\u00e9rentes mesures afin d'am\u00e9liorer sa compr\u00e9hension des personnes autistes et d'\u00eatre un meilleur gestionnaire, par exemple en organisant une r\u00e9union avec Mme Poirier. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes devait s'adapter au processus cognitif de Mme Dawson. Selon elle, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a tent\u00e9 d'accommoder Mme Dawson, mais certaines r\u00e8gles \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9es et compte tenu de ces r\u00e8gles, l'accommodement de Mme Dawson n'\u00e9tait pas toujours facile. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a fait de son mieux, d'apr\u00e8s elle, en fonction de la connaissance qu'elle avait de l'autisme.\n[242] Quoi qu'il en soit, le Tribunal trouve troublant pour l'avenir des personnes autistes qu'elles soient per\u00e7ues comme posant une menace \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des autres en raison de leur \u00e9tat et qu'elles constituent une nuisance en milieu de travail. L'employeur a le devoir de s'assurer non seulement que tous les employ\u00e9s travaillent dans un environnement s\u00e9curitaire, mais aussi que les mauvaises perceptions au sujet de l'\u00e9tat d'un employ\u00e9, caus\u00e9es par une mauvaise information ou une information inad\u00e9quate au sujet de cette d\u00e9ficience, n'entra\u00eenent pas les autres employ\u00e9s \u00e0 avoir des perceptions n\u00e9gatives et mal fond\u00e9es au sujet de cet employ\u00e9.\n[243] Une personne autiste devrait pouvoir s'attendre \u00e0 ce que son environnement de travail soit libre de toute mauvaise perception ou toute id\u00e9e fausse au sujet de son \u00e9tat. Les personnes autistes ont le droit d'\u00eatre trait\u00e9es avec \u00e9galit\u00e9, avec dignit\u00e9 et avec respect, sans avoir \u00e0 vivre avec de la discrimination ou du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9s sur leur \u00e9tat. \u00c0 ce sujet, dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 o\u00f9 le droit de la personne est primordial, un employeur a le devoir de r\u00e9futer de telles id\u00e9es fausses ou mauvaises perceptions au sujet de ces personnes.\n[244] Ce devoir d\u00e9coule de Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et du besoin d'\u00e9liminer tout comportement discriminatoire en milieu de travail ainsi que dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il convient de rappeler aux employeurs, ainsi qu'\u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8re, l'objet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, telle qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 2 de la Loi, qui est de donner effet au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n[245] Les personnes autistes, si elles veulent pouvoir s'accomplir dans un lieu de travail ou en soci\u00e9t\u00e9, ont besoin d'\u00eatre rassur\u00e9es qu'on fera tout ce qui est possible, jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive, afin de garantir que les mauvaises perceptions et les id\u00e9es fausses au sujet de leur \u00e9tat sont g\u00e9r\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e par leur employeur, afin que leurs coll\u00e8gues aient une compr\u00e9hension ad\u00e9quate de leur \u00e9tat et qu'ils ne soient pas port\u00e9s \u00e0 faire preuve de discrimination ou de harc\u00e8lement envers elles.\n[246] La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'apparence physique ou le comportement social d'une personne peut \u00eatre l'une des formes les plus cruelles de discrimination. En l'esp\u00e8ce, on a vu ou on a per\u00e7u que Mme Dawson, \u00e0 un moment dans sa carri\u00e8re \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, \u00e9tait une menace envers ses coll\u00e8gues parce qu'elle s'\u00e9tait inflig\u00e9e des blessures dans le pass\u00e9, et non pas parce qu'elle avait agress\u00e9 un coll\u00e8gue. On l'a ensuite per\u00e7ue comme une forme de nuisance parce qu'elle insistait afin d'obtenir des r\u00e9ponses rationnelles \u00e0 ses questions et qu'elle ne d\u00e9mordait jamais. Le fait est que, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que son diagnostic soit officiellement connu \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes en 1999, Mme Dawson \u00e9tait vue comme une excellente employ\u00e9e.\n[247] Le Tribunal est d'avis, compte tenu de la preuve, que l'intim\u00e9e doit r\u00e9viser ses politiques en mati\u00e8re de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement et doit mettre en place des programmes de formation qui sensibiliseront ses employ\u00e9s ainsi que ses gestionnaires aux besoins des personnes d\u00e9ficientes en milieu de travail, notamment les personnes autistes, afin que des personnes telles que Mme Dawson n'aient plus \u00e0 souffrir d'un manque de connaissances et de compr\u00e9hension envers leur \u00e9tat. \u00c0 ce sujet, compte tenu de l'expertise de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne dans ce type d'affaire, elle pourra certainement offrir de l'aide, qui devrait \u00eatre accept\u00e9e, \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\nV. ORDONNANCE [248] Pour les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, le Tribunal conclut que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Dawson contre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes est fond\u00e9e et que l'intim\u00e9e a contrevenu aux articles 7 et 14 de la Loi. Comme Mme Dawson n'a demand\u00e9 aucune r\u00e9paration, le Tribunal n'en accordera aucune. Cependant, le Tribunal ordonne que l'intim\u00e9e :\nfournisse une copie de ses politiques existantes ou modifi\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement, de discrimination et d'accommodement dans les 30 jours suivant la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal; travaille pendant un an avec la Commission afin de modifier ses politiques existantes pour qu'elles soient conformes \u00e0 Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et au droit canadien en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, si la Commission d\u00e9termine que des modifications sont n\u00e9cessaires; embauche, en consultation avec la Commission, des personnes appropri\u00e9es pour s'occuper de la formation en milieu de travail en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9quit\u00e9, d'accommodement et de sensibilit\u00e9 pour les gestionnaires et les employ\u00e9s, notamment en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'autisme et aux personnes autistes; prenne toutes les autres mesures que la Commission juge appropri\u00e9es dans les circonstances.\nSign\u00e9e par Pierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 12 septembre 2008\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1053\/3405\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nMichelle Dawson c.

Jensen\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] L'intim\u00e9, Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (le minist\u00e8re), a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rejeter une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Margaret Kelly (Stacey) contre le minist\u00e8re, sur le fondement que les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte faisaient l'objet d'un accord de r\u00e8glement inconditionnel conclu par les parties en 2003.\n[2] C'est la deuxi\u00e8me fois que l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente cette m\u00eame demande. Le 27 mai 2008, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate statuant que la demande \u00e9tait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e vu la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'un dossier plus exhaustif qui lui permettrait de prendre une d\u00e9cision. Le Tribunal ne s'est pas prononc\u00e9 sur le fond de la requ\u00eate et a expliqu\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait libre de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate semblable \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure.\n[3] Depuis cette d\u00e9cision, les parties ont communiqu\u00e9 tous les documents en leur possession ainsi que leurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cisions. De plus, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux affidavits \u00e0 l'appui de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, le premier de Louis-Alexandre Guay, avocat pour le minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Canada, et le deuxi\u00e8me d'Allan Tallman, bureau du Registre des Indiens du minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien. De nombreux documents \u00e9taient annex\u00e9s \u00e0 ces affidavits comme pi\u00e8ces - les plaintes, l'accord de r\u00e8glement, la loi sur l'appartenance et un certificat attestant le recours \u00e0 l'assistance d'un avocat ind\u00e9pendant. \u00c0 mon avis, il y a maintenant suffisamment de documentation au dossier permettant de rendre une d\u00e9cision sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\nLe contexte\n[4] En 1999, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne contre le Conseil des Mohawks de Kahnawake (le CMK) et le minist\u00e8re. Elle a soutenu que le CMK a refus\u00e9 de l'accepter comme membre de la bande en raison de sa situation familiale et que, en cons\u00e9quence, elle s'est vu refuser les services offerts par le CMK. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que le refus de services constituait une pratique discriminatoire au sens de l'article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). Dans sa plainte contre le minist\u00e8re, Mme Kelly (Stacey) a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le minist\u00e8re avait aussi agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en omettant d'intervenir dans la conduite de la bande et en continuant de financer le CMK pour la prestation de services qui lui ont cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9s.\n[5] En 2003, la plaignante a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 ses plaintes contre le CMK et le minist\u00e8re. Au moment de la conclusion de l'accord, le CMK r\u00e9visait sa loi sur l'appartenance. On croyait que la r\u00e9vision permettrait peut-\u00eatre de r\u00e9gler les questions soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes. L'accord de r\u00e8glement rendait compte de l'incertitude quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de la plainte et disposait que, bien que Mme Kelly (Stacey) d\u00e9gageait le CMK de toutes les actions qu'elle avait intent\u00e9es ou pouvait intenter, si les deux parties ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 r\u00e9gler la question relative \u00e0 l'appartenance de mani\u00e8re satisfaisante d'ici le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2004, alors sa renonciation aux actions [traduction] dans la mesure seule o\u00f9 elle s'applique \u00e0 la question relative \u00e0 l'appartenance contre le CMK est nulle et sans effet.\n[6] En revanche, la disposition dans l'accord de r\u00e8glement concernant le minist\u00e8re \u00e9tait inconditionnel. Cette disposition pr\u00e9voyait que Mme Kelly (Stacey) d\u00e9gageait le minist\u00e8re et la Couronne de toutes les actions qu'elle avait intent\u00e9es ou pouvait intenter d\u00e9coulant de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit des questions all\u00e9gu\u00e9es dans la plainte contre le minist\u00e8re - y compris, entre autres, la r\u00e9clamation p\u00e9cuniaire et la question relative \u00e0 l'appartenance contre le minist\u00e8re.\n[7] Mme Kelly (Stacey) a eu recours \u00e0 un avocat ind\u00e9pendant avant de signer l'accord. D'apr\u00e8s le certificat attestant le recours \u00e0 l'assistance d'un avocat ind\u00e9pendant, Mme Kelly (Stacey) \u00e9tait parfaitement au courant des dispositions de l'accord de r\u00e8glement et de leurs cons\u00e9quences juridiques avant de le signer.\n[8] Une fois l'accord de r\u00e8glement sign\u00e9, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne l'a approuv\u00e9 et un avis de d\u00e9sistement a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant le Tribunal dans les deux dossiers le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2003. L'accord de r\u00e8glement pouvait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 selon les m\u00eames modalit\u00e9s qu'une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vertu du paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi.\n[9] En 2005, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de nouvelles plaintes contre le CMK, le minist\u00e8re et le conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s dans lesquelles elle all\u00e8gue que la question de son appartenance n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la loi nouvelle sur l'appartenance de la bande Kahnawake et qu'on avait continu\u00e9 de lui refuser l'acc\u00e8s aux programmes et aux services. Les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal aux fins d'instruction.\nAnalyse\n[10] L'intim\u00e9, le minist\u00e8re, soutient que le Tribunal devrait rejeter la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les questions soulev\u00e9es dans celle-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es.\n[11] L'intim\u00e9, le CMK, ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Il affirme que le pr\u00e9sent litige ne concerne pas le minist\u00e8re, mais qu'il s'agit d'un litige interne sur l'appartenance entre la plaignante et lui-m\u00eame.\n[12] La Commission ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte contre le minist\u00e8re.\n[13] La plaignante, Mme Kelly (Stacey), a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l'observation selon laquelle, en tant que membre des Premi\u00e8res nations, elle ne rel\u00e8ve pas d'une comp\u00e9tence canadienne. Elle ne reconna\u00eet plut\u00f4t que la comp\u00e9tence d'un organisme traditionnel compos\u00e9 du peuple, en conformit\u00e9 avec la Grande loi de la paix et le trait\u00e9 du wampum \u00e0 deux rangs. Elle croit que toutes les n\u00e9gociations engag\u00e9es avec le gouvernement du Canada ne s'appliquent pas \u00e0 elle. Il semblerait que ces n\u00e9gociations comprennent celles ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accord de r\u00e8glement.\n[14] \u00c0 mon avis, le pouvoir du Tribunal de trancher la question soulev\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9coule du pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi de trancher les questions de droit ou de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi dans le cadre d'une instruction. Dans Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a affirm\u00e9 que d\u00e9cider d'une question pr\u00e9liminaire fait partie de l'instruction. \u00c9tant ma\u00eetre du d\u00e9roulement de l'instance, le Tribunal avait le droit de d\u00e9broussailler la proc\u00e9dure avant de tenir une audience sur le fond.\n[15] Mme Kelly (Stacey) a re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 p\u00e9cuniaire pour avoir accept\u00e9 de ne pas intenter d'autres actions quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte contre le minist\u00e8re. Les questions soulev\u00e9es en 1999 dans la plainte contre le minist\u00e8re sont identiques aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 2005 contre lui : le minist\u00e8re n'avait pas emp\u00each\u00e9 le CMK d'exclure Mme Kelly (Stacey) de l'appartenance \u00e0 la bande et de refuser \u00e0 celle-ci d'obtenir les avantages offerts aux membres. Bien que l'accord de r\u00e8glement n'\u00e9carte pas la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser une plainte contre le CMK si Mme Kelly (Stacey) n'\u00e9tait pas satisfaite de l'issue du processus de renouvellement des membres, il d\u00e9fendait express\u00e9ment cette possibilit\u00e9 quant au minist\u00e8re. L'accord de r\u00e8glement ne laissait aucune possibilit\u00e9 de soulever de nouveau la question \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du minist\u00e8re. Mme Kelly (Stacey) a obtenu de l'aide d'un avocat pour comprendre ce point.\n[16] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la documentation au dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que Mme Kelly (Stacey) n'a sign\u00e9 l'accord qu'apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu l'aide d'un avocat ind\u00e9pendant. L'avocat qu'elle a consult\u00e9 a attest\u00e9 \u00eatre convaincu que Mme Kelly (Stacey) comprenait parfaitement et acceptait les dispositions de l'accord ainsi que les cons\u00e9quences juridiques si elle le signait. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement convaincu que Mme Kelly (Stacey) ne se sentait pas tenue d'accepter l'accord de r\u00e8glement ou contrainte \u00e0 l'accepter; elle l'a sign\u00e9 volontairement.\n[17] Mme Kelly (Stacey) n'a pas contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de sa renonciation sur le fondement de la contrainte, de la capacit\u00e9, de la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation de signature ou de tout autre motif. Sa d\u00e9claration qu'elle ne reconna\u00eet pas la comp\u00e9tence du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral n'a aucune incidence sur la validit\u00e9 de sa renonciation.\n[18] Dans la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure du Tribunal sur cette question, le vice-pr\u00e9sident Hadjis a fait remarquer que de nouveaux faits semblaient \u00eatre survenus apr\u00e8s la signature de la renonciation, qui pourrait avoir une incidence sur l'applicabilit\u00e9 de la renonciation. Ces faits comprenaient l'\u00e9laboration par le CMK d'une nouvelle loi sur l'appartenance et la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation au conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s du pouvoir de d\u00e9cider de l'appartenance \u00e0 la bande.\n[19] Cependant, l'accord de r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voyait clairement qu'une nouvelle loi sur l'appartenance \u00e9tait en cours d'\u00e9laboration et que, d\u00e9pendamment de la fa\u00e7on dont cette loi s'appliquerait \u00e0 la plaignante, il \u00e9tait possible qu'elle d\u00e9sire d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte contre le CMK. Cons\u00e9quemment, elle ne s'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de le faire contre le minist\u00e8re. Par cons\u00e9quent, la nouvelle loi sur l'appartenance n'a pas d'incidence sur l'applicabilit\u00e9 de la renonciation \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte contre le minist\u00e8re.\n[20] La question du pouvoir du minist\u00e8re d'intervenir dans des affaires ayant trait \u00e0 l'appartenance de la plaignante \u00e0 la bande a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e en 2003. En cons\u00e9quence, la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation au conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s du pouvoir de d\u00e9cider de l'appartenance \u00e0 la bande n'est pas pertinente quant \u00e0 l'applicabilit\u00e9 de la renonciation \u00e0 la plainte contre le minist\u00e8re.\n[21] Je crois donc que le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le maintenant que ni l'un ni l'autre de ces deux nouveaux faits n'ont d'incidence sur l'applicabilit\u00e9 de la renonciation \u00e0 la plainte contre le minist\u00e8re.\n[22] Il ne s'agit pas d'une affaire o\u00f9 Mme Kelly (Stacey) \u00e0 renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la protection de la Loi. Elle a sign\u00e9 un accord selon lequel elle ne soul\u00e8verait pas de nouveau cette question particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du minist\u00e8re; la question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. Ce n'est pas comme signer un contrat de travail ou un bail qui interdit le recours \u00e0 la Loi dans le cas de possibles violations de la Loi. Comme dans l'arr\u00eat Gee c. Canada (Ministre du Revenu national), 2002 CAF 4, je trouve difficile de d\u00e9peindre l'accord en l'esp\u00e8ce comme un accord de renoncer \u00e0 la protection de la Loi.\n[23] Le tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique a affirm\u00e9 dans Thompson c. Providence Health Care, 2003 BCHRT 58, qu'il est manifestement dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public d'encourager les parties \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre leurs litiges de fa\u00e7on consensuelle et volontaire. Cet int\u00e9r\u00eat public serait fortement sap\u00e9 si les parties, ayant conclu un accord d\u00e9finitif relativement \u00e0 leur litige li\u00e9 aux droits de la personne, avaient le droit, en l'absence de consid\u00e9rations relatives \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u00e9montrant le contraire, de se pr\u00e9senter et de poursuivre une plainte devant le Tribunal. Mme Kelly (Stacey) a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 sa plainte contre le minist\u00e8re en 2003; elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 poursuivre aujourd'hui cette m\u00eame plainte devant le Tribunal.\n[24] La plainte de Mme Kelly (Stacey) contre le minist\u00e8re est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nKaren A.

Hadjis\n[1] L'intim\u00e9e, United Parcel Service Canada Ltd. (UPS), pr\u00e9tend que la plaignante Esper Powell, a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 en 2007 la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qu'elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre UPS. Par cons\u00e9quent, UPS a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance du Tribunal confirmant le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 r\u00e8glement et mettant fin \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance devant le Tribunal.\n[2] En janvier 2002, Mme Powell a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte dans laquelle elle pr\u00e9tendait avoir fait l'objet de discrimination de la part de son employeur, UPS, en raison de son sexe (femme), de sa race et de sa couleur (noire). En ao\u00fbt 2004, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour enqu\u00eate. L'audience portant sur la plainte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 11 juin 2007. Avant cette date, Mme Powell et UPS ont entrepris, par l'entremise de leurs avocats, des discussions en vue d'un r\u00e8glement et ces discussions se sont sold\u00e9es par l'acceptation de la part de UPS de la contre-offre faite par Mme Powell. Le 8 juin 2007, l'avocat de UPS a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 l'avocat de Mme Powell confirmant cette acceptation. L'avocat de UPS a termin\u00e9 son courriel en d\u00e9clarant ce qui suit : [traduction] La pr\u00e9sente affaire est donc r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. L'avocat de Mme Powell a r\u00e9pondu le m\u00eame jour par un courriel dans lequel il affirmait qu'il [traduction] confirm[ait] que l'affaire [\u00e9tait] r\u00e9gl\u00e9e.\n[3] L'avocat de UPS a imm\u00e9diatement inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que l'affaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a donc \u00e9crit aux parties le m\u00eame jour (le 8 juin 2007) afin de les informer que l'affaire \u00e9tait ajourn\u00e9e sine die en attendant que la Commission l'avise que le proc\u00e8s-verbal du r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9, et ce, en conformit\u00e9 avec le paragraphe 48(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 que d\u00e8s que la Commission l'aurait avis\u00e9, il d\u00e9livrerait un avis de d\u00e9sistement, mettant ainsi fin \u00e0 l'affaire.\n[4] Selon UPS, Mme Powell a refus\u00e9 de prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour finaliser le r\u00e8glement. Elle n'a pas sign\u00e9 le projet d'entente ni la D\u00e9charge totale et d\u00e9finitive r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par l'avocat de UPS. Le 20 novembre 2007, l'avocat de UPS a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que le proc\u00e8s-verbal du r\u00e8glement n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 et, le 27 novembre 2007, Mme Powell a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle avait un nouveau conseiller juridique. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9pondu aux parties que, en l'absence d'un r\u00e8glement de la plainte sign\u00e9, il entendrait l'affaire.\n[5] UPS fait valoir que l'affaire soumise au Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par l'\u00e9change de correspondance qui a eu lieu entre les avocats en juin 2007, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la question de savoir si le proc\u00e8s-verbal du r\u00e8glement avait finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9. Elle a donc d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en vue d'obtenir une ordonnance confirmant le r\u00e8glement de la plainte.\n[6] Selon l'article 48 de la Loi, les parties qui conviennent d'un r\u00e8glement avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience doivent en pr\u00e9senter les conditions \u00e0 l'approbation de la Commission :\n48. (1) Les parties qui conviennent d'un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, mais avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience d'un tribunal des droits de la personne, en pr\u00e9sentent les conditions \u00e0 l'approbation de la Commission.\n(2) Dans le cas pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe (1), la Commission certifie sa d\u00e9cision et la communique aux parties.\n(3) Le r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission peut, par requ\u00eate d'une partie ou de la Commission \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de cette juridiction et \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle.\n48. (1) When, at any stage after the filing of a complaint and before the commencement of a hearing before a Human Rights Tribunal in respect thereof, a settlement is agreed on by the parties, the terms of the settlement shall be referred to the Commission for approval or rejection.\n(2) If the Commission approves or rejects the terms of a settlement referred to in subsection (1), it shall so certify and notify the parties.\n(3) A settlement approved under this section may, for the purpose of enforcement, be made an order of the Federal Court on application to that Court by the Commission or a party to the settlement.\nDans ses observations \u00e9crites concernant la requ\u00eate de UPS, la Commission souligne que [traduction] rien ne prouve qu'un r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par la Commission. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission ajoute que les parties ne sont li\u00e9es par aucun r\u00e8glement qui peut \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au sens du paragraphe 48(3). [7] UPS pr\u00e9tend que, selon l'article 48, le r\u00f4le de la Commission consiste tout simplement \u00e0 approuver ou \u00e0 rejeter les r\u00e8glements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conclus et non pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si un r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu. UPS pr\u00e9tend que cette question doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e par le Tribunal. Dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, UPS pr\u00e9tend qu'un r\u00e8glement ex\u00e9cutoire a en fait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu, et ce, malgr\u00e9 l'absence d'approbation de la part de la Commission.\n[8] Selon moi, cet argument repose sur une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e de l'article 48. Le libell\u00e9 de la disposition est clair. Avant le d\u00e9but d'une audience, aucune plainte ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e sans l'approbation de la Commission. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 87 de la d\u00e9cision Loyer c. Air Canada, 2006 CF 1172 :\nIl y a peu de jurisprudence sur l'article 48 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cependant, lorsqu'on lit la disposition dans son contexte, en tenant compte des objets de la Loi tout enti\u00e8re, et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du mandat de la Commission dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, il est clair que l'objet de l'article 48 est de faire en sorte que les commissaires eux-m\u00eames puissent intervenir dans le r\u00e8glement d'une plainte, pour s'assurer que les buts r\u00e9parateurs de la Loi sont bien pris en compte dans la solution apport\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[9] En vertu de l'article 48, les parties n'ont pas le choix de soumettre ou non le r\u00e8glement \u00e0 la Commission. Dans la version anglaise de l'article, il est mentionn\u00e9 que le r\u00e8glement sera renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission. Dans la version fran\u00e7aise, les parties pr\u00e9sentent les conditions du r\u00e8glement \u00e0 l'approbation de la Commission. Cette exigence est conforme \u00e0 la conclusion tir\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Loyer selon laquelle l'objet de l'article 48 est de faire en sorte que les commissaires eux-m\u00eames puissent intervenir dans le r\u00e8glement d'une plainte pour s'assurer que les buts r\u00e9parateurs de la Loi sont bien pris en compte dans la solution apport\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte. Sans une telle intervention, il ne peut y avoir aucun r\u00e8glement.\n[10] Rien n'indique que la Commission a express\u00e9ment ou tacitement approuv\u00e9 le pr\u00e9tendu r\u00e8glement conclu entre Mme Powell et UPS. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut de cette approbation, on ne peut pas affirmer qu'il existe un r\u00e8glement qui met fin \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate du Tribunal sur la plainte.\n[11] Bien entendu, selon l'article 48, l'approbation susmentionn\u00e9e n'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 exig\u00e9e que si le r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience. UPS invoque comme argument additionnel que le r\u00e8glement en l'esp\u00e8ce n'a pas en fait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience au sens de l'article 48. Elle pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal a pris des mesures, notamment des conf\u00e9rences pr\u00e9paratoires et la d\u00e9livrance de diverses ordonnances de nature proc\u00e9durale qui d\u00e9montrent qu'il s'est lanc\u00e9 dans le processus de l'audience. \u00c0 ce titre, il y a eu d\u00e9but d'une audience et l'approbation du r\u00e8glement par la Commission n'est plus exig\u00e9e.\n[12] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de UPS. La Loi parle d'une audience et d'une instruction, elle ne parle aucunement d'un processus d'audience. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a tenu compte de ces deux mots ( audience et instruction ) dans Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81, au paragraphe 17. La Cour a soulign\u00e9 que l'article 50 de la Loi mentionne s\u00e9par\u00e9ment chacune de ces expressions et les traite comme \u00e9tant des notions distinctes. La Cour si\u00e9geait dans le cadre du contr\u00f4le judiciaire d'une d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal \u00e0 la suite d'une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire que la d\u00e9fenderesse avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vue d'obtenir le rejet de la plainte avant que celle-ci ne soit entendue sur le fond. La Commission avait pr\u00e9tendu que le Tribunal devait tenir l'audience avant de rejeter la plainte et que la requ\u00eate \u00e9tait par cons\u00e9quent pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. La Cour ne souscrivait pas \u00e0 cette affirmation. Elle a conclu que bien que, selon l'article 50, le membre instructeur doit instruire chaque plainte qui lui est renvoy\u00e9e, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'une audience soit tenue dans tous les cas. La requ\u00eate en rejet n'\u00e9tait donc pas pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e.\n[13] Par cons\u00e9quent, selon moi, il ressort de la conclusion de la Cour que le sens \u00e0 donner au mot audience est la tenue d'une v\u00e9ritable audience au fond sur la plainte elle-m\u00eame. Elle n'englobe aucune activit\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieure, notamment les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires que le Tribunal peut envisager afin de d\u00e9broussailler la proc\u00e9dure (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, au paragraphe 14), comme la requ\u00eate en rejet qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans cette affaire.\n[14] En l'esp\u00e8ce, UPS pr\u00e9tend que pour la simple raison que le Tribunal a tenu un certain nombre de conf\u00e9rences pr\u00e9paratoires par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, a donn\u00e9 un certain nombre de directives portant sur des questions comme le calendrier et la divulgation et s'est prononc\u00e9 sur une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire (uniquement sur le fondement d'observations \u00e9crites), l' audience au sens de la Loi a commenc\u00e9. Cette pr\u00e9tention n'est manifestement pas conforme aux conclusions tir\u00e9es par la Cour dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Selon moi, l'audience relative \u00e0 la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de Mme Powell n'a pas encore commenc\u00e9. L'article 48 est donc applicable et, sans l'approbation de la Commission, on ne peut pas affirmer que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e.\n[15] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, la requ\u00eate de UPS est rejet\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] L'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en ajournement de la nouvelle audition de la plainte jusqu'\u00e0 l'issue du contr\u00f4le judiciaire qu'elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire vise une d\u00e9cision rendue par le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, de ne pas accorder son agr\u00e9ment pour que Me Pierre Deschamps termine l'instruction de la plainte. La Commission et la plaignante contestent la requ\u00eate.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e souligne que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a choisi le 11 d\u00e9cembre 2008 comme date d'audition de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Elle souligne \u00e9galement que la Commission a consenti \u00e0 l'ordonnance qu'elle sollicite en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La plaignante, pour sa part, a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de r\u00e9examiner sa d\u00e9cision. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'intim\u00e9e soutient que sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire ne sera que peu contest\u00e9e, si contestation il y a. Si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u00e9cerne l'ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e, la nouvelle audience de la plainte ne sera plus n\u00e9cessaire. L'intim\u00e9e demande donc un ajournement jusqu'\u00e0 l'issue de l'instance dont la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est saisie.\n[3] Cependant, comme la Commission l'a soulign\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en intervention dans le cadre de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. L'audience relative \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en intervention se tiendra le 22 octobre 2008.\n[4] Actuellement, on ne peut clairement pr\u00e9voir quelles cons\u00e9quences aura l'issue de cette requ\u00eate sur la d\u00e9cision qui sera finalement rendue dans le cadre du contr\u00f4le judiciaire. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale peut toujours rejeter la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, ind\u00e9pendamment des positions respectives des parties, auquel cas l'ajournement cr\u00e9erait un retard inutile dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. Comme le juge Harrington l'a mentionn\u00e9 en rendant sa d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate en suspension d'instance pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment par l'intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, [u]ne suspension d'instance causerait une perte de temps pr\u00e9cieux si la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire est rejet\u00e9e, que ce soit en premi\u00e8re instance ou en appel. (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (les Forces canadiennes) c. Montreuil, 2008 CF 530, paragraphe 37.)\n[5] La Commission a soulign\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne porte sur des actes discriminatoires qui se seraient produits en 1999. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 2002 et renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal en 2005.\n[6] L'instruction des plaintes par le Tribunal devrait se faire sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique (paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi)). \u00c0 sa discr\u00e9tion, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'ajourner une instance en tenant compte des principes de justice naturelle (voir la d\u00e9cision Brooks c. Canada (P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans), 2007 TCDP 4, paragraphe 6). On pourrait donner comme exemples de probl\u00e8me en mati\u00e8re de justice naturelle auquel le Tribunal pourrait \u00eatre confront\u00e9, la non-disponibilit\u00e9 de la preuve, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'ajourner afin que l'on puisse se pr\u00e9valoir des services d'un avocat ou une divulgation tardive de la part de la partie adverse. En l'esp\u00e8ce, tout comme dans l'affaire Brooks, on ne peut pr\u00e9dire la d\u00e9cision qui sera finalement rendue dans le cadre du contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e9tabli que de permettre au Tribunal de poursuivre l'instruction dans de telles circonstances soul\u00e8verait un probl\u00e8me de justice naturelle de ce genre.\n[7] L'intim\u00e9e a soulign\u00e9 dans sa requ\u00eate que, selon des d\u00e9clarations faites en ao\u00fbt 2008, les parties ne seraient pas disponibles pour la nouvelle audience avant janvier 2009. Ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que ces d\u00e9clarations puissent ne plus \u00eatre exactes, je ne peux trouver en quoi elles sont pertinentes en l'esp\u00e8ce. Les avocats et les parties auront toujours des emplois du temps charg\u00e9s. Cela ne devrait pas emp\u00eacher le Tribunal de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'audience de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive comme la Loi le prescrit.\n[8] Pour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate en ajournement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n[1] L'intim\u00e9, le Service correctionnel du Canada, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate par laquelle il demande que la plainte de Michael Pochay soit rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de demande abandonn\u00e9e.\n[2] M. Pochay s'est plaint le 22 octobre 2003 que les politiques et lignes directrices de dotation mixte du Service correctionnel du Canada ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00e0 l'endroit des d\u00e9tenus de sexe masculin comparativement \u00e0 l'endroit des d\u00e9tenues de sexe f\u00e9minin dans les \u00e9tablissements f\u00e9d\u00e9raux.\n[3] Pendant l'enqu\u00eate sur la plainte effectu\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, le plaignant n'a communiqu\u00e9 qu'une seule fois avec la Commission, soit le 17 ao\u00fbt 2006; il ne l'a pas contact\u00e9e par la suite. La Commission a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de joindre le plaignant. Cependant, il semble qu'il ait d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 et chang\u00e9 ses num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. La Commission n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 trouver le plaignant.\n[4] Le 26 mai 2008, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties pour les informer que la plainte lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour qu'il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une instruction de la plainte. Le 16 juin 2008, la lettre \u00e0 l'intention du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e par Messageries prioritaires; elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e et le message Destinataire non trouv\u00e9 08\/05\/28 y figurait. Le Tribunal a tent\u00e9 maintes fois de joindre le plaignant, tant par courrier que par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, en vain. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de communiquer avec le plaignant et ce dernier n'a pas tent\u00e9 de le joindre.\n[5] Le 26 juin 2008, une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence sur la gestion de l'instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue en pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 l'audience. Le plaignant n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence.\n[6] Dans sa requ\u00eate, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que le plaignant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 un manque de volont\u00e9 \u00e0 faire instruire sa plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[7] Quant \u00e0 la Commission, elle affirme que le rejet d'une plainte \u00e0 ce stade-ci constitue une mesure extraordinaire et pourrait donner lieu \u00e0 un d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle. La Commission soutient que bien que le Tribunal ait le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte sans tenir d'audience (Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81, au paragraphe 19), il serait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 de le faire \u00e0 ce stade-ci. La Commission propose plut\u00f4t au Tribunal d'ordonner au plaignant de respecter le paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal en pr\u00e9sentant son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dans un d\u00e9lai de trois semaines, faute de quoi sa plainte serait rejet\u00e9e.\n[8] J'accepte la suggestion de la Commission. J'ordonne donc au plaignant de signifier et de d\u00e9poser - dans les trois semaines suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision - son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e9tablissant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Sinon, sa plainte pourra \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[9] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e sans pr\u00e9judice du droit de l'intim\u00e9 de renouveler sa demande si le plaignant ne se conforme pas \u00e0 l'exigence de fournir son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dans les trois semaines vis\u00e9es.\nKaren A.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] Par d\u00e9cision du Tribunal en date du 20 juin 2008 (2008 TCDP 26), la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Keeper-Anderson aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne le 13 octobre 2004 contre l'intim\u00e9e, la Southern Chiefs Organization Inc. (la SCO), a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e. \u00c0 l'audience, Mme Keeper-Anderson a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de lui accorder ce qui suit :\nUne indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire pour la p\u00e9riode de mai 2005 \u00e0 mai 2007, s'\u00e9levant \u00e0 90 000 $ (45 000 par ann\u00e9e), soit le salaire qu'elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 toucher au moment de son licenciement; Une indemnit\u00e9 pour avantages perdus 5 000 $; 5 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral; 15 000 $ d'indemnit\u00e9 pour l'acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e de la SCO; les frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 la vente de sa maison; les frais juridiques; les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les sommes susmentionn\u00e9es.\n[2] Compte tenu de sa d\u00e9cision rendue le 20 juin 2008 (2008 TCDP 26) afin de l'aider \u00e0 d\u00e9cider du montant de la r\u00e9paration, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de lui fournir, au plus tard le 15 juillet 2008, des preuves sur son revenu total (toutes ses sources de revenu) de mai 2005 \u00e0 mai 2007. Elle devait aussi faire savoir si elle \u00e9tait tenue de rembourser des prestations d'assurance-emploi ou toutes autres prestations de revenu qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es au cours de la p\u00e9riode en cause.\n[3] Mme Keeper-Anderson a demand\u00e9 et a obtenu une prorogation de d\u00e9lai jusqu'au 28 juillet 2008 pour pr\u00e9senter ces preuves quant aux redressements. Elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses documents devant le Tribunal le 25 juillet 2008.\n[4] Le 31 juillet 2008, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que la SCO avait jusqu'au 6 ao\u00fbt 2008 pour r\u00e9pondre aux observations de la plaignante sur les redressements. Une prorogation de ce d\u00e9lai a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e jusqu'au 11 ao\u00fbt 2008 et une autre, jusqu'au 5 septembre 2008. Cependant, la SCO n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 celles de Mme Keeper-Anderson.\n[5] Les preuves fournies par Mme Keeper-Anderson comprennent ce qui suit : ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es 2005, 2006 et 2007; un \u00e9tat d'extinction d'hypoth\u00e8que de son repr\u00e9sentant juridique quant \u00e0 la mainlev\u00e9e de son hypoth\u00e8que et une mention du montant des frais juridiques et des d\u00e9bours \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 1 100 $ au 8 novembre 2005 (pour litige); un relev\u00e9 d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des paiements de son salaire de f\u00e9vrier 2004 \u00e0 avril 2005; un \u00e9tat de compte de son pr\u00eat \u00e9tudiant; de la correspondance concernant des traitements orthodontiques et des soins de la vue.\n[6] Mme Keeper-Anderson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 une perte salariale de mai 2005 \u00e0 mai 2007. Par cons\u00e9quent, tant le salaire qu'elle aurait re\u00e7u que son revenu total selon ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour la p\u00e9riode en cause doivent \u00eatre pris en compte dans le calcul. J'ai calcul\u00e9 au prorata le salaire de Mme Keeper-Anderson de mai 2005 \u00e0 mai 2007 et soustrait son revenu calcul\u00e9 au prorata qu'elle a inscrit dans ses d\u00e9clarations de 2005, 2006 et 2007. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'\u00e9value la somme du revenu qu'elle a perdue \u00e0 40 000 $.\n[7] Quant \u00e0 la somme de 5 000 $ que r\u00e9clame Mme Keeper-Anderson pour les avantages qu'elle a perdus, les preuves fournies n'appuient pas sa r\u00e9clamation. Je refuse donc de lui accorder ce montant.\n[8] Pour ce qui concerne sa demande de remboursement des d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es pour la vente de sa maison, Mme Keeper-Anderson a fourni deux preuves : les co\u00fbts relatifs \u00e0 la gestion immobili\u00e8re \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 720 $ au 8 novembre 2005 et le montant des frais juridiques et des d\u00e9bours \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 5 627 $ au 8 novembre 2005. Elle n'a pas donn\u00e9 de d\u00e9tails sur ces co\u00fbts. Par cons\u00e9quent, sa demande est rejet\u00e9e.\n[9] Mme Keeper-Anderson r\u00e9clame des frais juridiques et d\u00e9bours \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 1 100 $ au 8 novembre 2005 (pour litige). Mme Keeper-Anderson a retenu les services d'un avocat pour contester son licenciement et solliciter une r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. Les preuves pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audience r\u00e9v\u00e8lent qu'il y a eu des \u00e9changes entre l'avocat de Mme Keeper-Anderson et celui de la SCO, mais rien de plus. Les documents que Mme Keeper-Anderson a fournis ne font aucune mention de cela. Dans ces circonstances, j'accorde 200 $ \u00e0 titre de frais juridiques.\n[10] De m\u00eame, Mme Keeper-Anderson n'a pas fourni de preuves ni formul\u00e9 d'argument convaincant d\u00e9montrant une conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e de la part de l'intim\u00e9e. Sa r\u00e9clamation du montant de 15 000 $ est donc rejet\u00e9e.\n[11] Il ressort n\u00e9anmoins clairement des preuves que Mme Keeper-Anderson a subi un pr\u00e9judice par suite de son licenciement et je lui accorde 2 000 $ en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour les actes discriminatoires commis par la SCO.\n[12] Les int\u00e9r\u00eats accord\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sur le montant total de 42 200 $ courent conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne.\nJ.

Avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience, l'agent du greffe a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appel des parties et leur a demand\u00e9 de remplir leur fiche de comparution. Me Daniel Poulin, avocat de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, et Me Fran\u00e7ois Dandonneau, l'un des avocats de l'intim\u00e9, le Conseil des Mohawks de Kahnawake, \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents. Me Dandonneau a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que sa coll\u00e8gue, Mme Mary Lee Armstrong, arriverait tr\u00e8s bient\u00f4t, et il avait raison.\n[2] La plaignante, Margaret Kelly (Stacey), n'a pas comparu et elle n'a pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ouverture de l'audience. Personne n'a comparu non plus en son nom. Personne n'a comparu au nom du Conseil des a\u00eenes.\n[3] Le Tribunal a suspendu l'audience jusqu'\u00e0 14 h ce jour-l\u00e0. \u00c0 la reprise de l'audience, l'agent du greffe a lu l'affaire \u00e0 \u00eatre entendue et a de nouveau proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appel des parties. L'avocat de la Commission et les avocats de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents, cependant, Mme Kelly n'\u00e9tait toujours pas pr\u00e9sente et personne ne la repr\u00e9sentait.\n[4] Des documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal sous la cote T-1 confirmant que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de l'audience, notamment les suivants :\nune lettre du Tribunal en date du 1er octobre 2008 r\u00e9sumant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d'instance du 30 septembre 2008; l'avis d'audience r\u00e9vis\u00e9 du Tribunal en date du 1er octobre 2008 confirmant les dates d'audience des 16 et 17 octobre 2008 et du 27 au 31 octobre 2008; la d\u00e9cision rendue le 30 septembre 2008 par le Tribunal, 2008 TCDP 42, rejetant la plainte and le dossier du Tribunal T1270\/8207, Margaret Kelly (Stacey) c.

En 2004 et en 2005, elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature deux fois pour un poste aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Cumberland House Cree Nation. Sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e les deux fois. Dans sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, elle soutient qu\u2019on lui a refus\u00e9 le poste parce qu\u2019elle est une M\u00e9tisse et qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas une Indienne vis\u00e9e par un trait\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas membre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de la Cumberland House Cree Nation (la bande). Dans son formulaire de plainte, elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 quelles dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) avaient cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9es. Cependant, dans le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte que la Commission a annex\u00e9 \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019article 7 est cit\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant l\u2019article applicable de la LCDP et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant le motif de distinction illicite pertinent quant \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination.\n[2] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que la plainte est fond\u00e9e. Je conclus aussi qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la bande ne peut pas avoir recours \u00e0 l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP.\nI. Les faits [3] Pendant la majeure partie de sa vie, Mme Deschambeault a habit\u00e9 dans Cumberland House Northern village (ci-apr\u00e8s le village), agglom\u00e9ration situ\u00e9e sur une \u00eele (Pine Island) de la rivi\u00e8re Saskatchewan dans une r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e du Nord-Est de la Saskatchewan, \u00e0 environ 350 km de Prince Albert. Le village partage l\u2019\u00eele avec la r\u00e9serve de Cumberland House Cree Nation. Le village et la bande sont \u00e0 quelques kilom\u00e8tres de distance l\u2019un de l\u2019autre. Ils partagent certains services, comme l\u2019unique ar\u00e9na de l\u2019\u00eele, et leurs r\u00e9sidents respectifs fr\u00e9quentent autant l\u2019\u00e9cole du village que celle de la bande (il y a une \u00e9cole de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9). Il y a un seul bureau de poste sur l\u2019\u00eele, qui se trouve du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du village.\n[4] Ce ne sont pas tous les membres inscrits de la bande qui r\u00e9sident sur la r\u00e9serve. D\u2019apr\u00e8s des chiffres publi\u00e9s par le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien, seulement 592 des 1 062 membres inscrits de la bande habitent dans la r\u00e9serve (donn\u00e9es de f\u00e9vrier 2007). La plupart des membres qui n\u2019habitent pas dans la r\u00e9serve habitent dans le village. La population du village est compos\u00e9e presque enti\u00e8rement de membres de la bande et de M\u00e9tis. Par ailleurs, certains M\u00e9tis habitent dans la r\u00e9serve. Par cons\u00e9quent, les vies des membres de la bande de la Premi\u00e8re Nation et des M\u00e9tis sont \u00e9troitement li\u00e9es. Ils ont grandi ensemble et dans de nombreux cas, ils sont parents. Cependant, comme Mme Deschambeault l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, certaines personnes ne manquent pas de rappeler les diff\u00e9rences entre les membres de la bande de la Premi\u00e8re Nation (les Indiens vis\u00e9s par un trait\u00e9) et les personnes qui sont des M\u00e9tis.\nA. Le concours de 2004 [5] En 2004, Mme Deschambeault travaillait comme intervenante en toxicomanie au Pine Island Health Centre, un centre de soins ambulatoires situ\u00e9 au village. Elle a vu une affiche qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e par la bande dans le bureau de poste du village, qui annon\u00e7ait qu\u2019un concours \u00e9tait lanc\u00e9 pour le poste de facilitateur de la gu\u00e9rison des anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves des pensionnats.\n[6] Ce poste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 suite \u00e0 une entente que la bande avait conclue avec la Fondation autochtone de gu\u00e9rison, un organisme qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli en 1998 apr\u00e8s la publication d\u2019un rapport de la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones. L\u2019objectif de la fondation est d\u2019aider \u00e0 la r\u00e9adaptation des personnes qui ont souffert d\u2019agressions dans les pensionnats. Le financement vient du gouvernement du Canada.\n[7] La bande a sign\u00e9 l\u2019entente avec la fondation en juin 2004 pour le financement d\u2019un projet de gu\u00e9rison. Ses objectifs comprenaient l\u2019\u00e9limination de toute forme de violence, quelle soit dirig\u00e9e vers des membres de la famille ou de la collectivit\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait l\u2019h\u00e9ritage des agressions physiques et sexuelles qui avaient eu lieu dans les pensionnats, et d\u2019appuyer la gu\u00e9rison individuelle, familiale et collective. Le projet pr\u00e9conisait l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un poste de deux ans d\u2019un facilitateur de la gu\u00e9rison qui devait coordonner et de faciliter le soutien aux victimes.\n[8] Mme Deschambeault avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 occup\u00e9 un poste au sein du M\u00e9tis Addictions Council de la Saskatchewan dans le cadre d\u2019un projet qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 financ\u00e9 par la fondation. Le poste comprenait la visite de collectivit\u00e9s m\u00e9tisses et le soutien aux victimes des pensionnats qui avaient besoin d\u2019aide. Elle a donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste de facilitateur. L\u2019affiche du poste ne mentionnait aucune politique d\u2019embauche qui favorisait les membres de la bande.\n[9] Le processus de s\u00e9lection \u00e9tait g\u00e9r\u00e9 par Lisa Cook, qui \u00e9tait directrice de la sant\u00e9 de la bande \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Six personnes ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature et la bande les a invit\u00e9es \u00e0 une entrevue. Quatre des candidats ont accept\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue, y compris Mme Deschambeault. Elle \u00e9tait la seule des quatre candidats qui \u00e9tait M\u00e9tisse. Les trois autres candidats \u00e9taient tous membres de la Premi\u00e8res Nation ainsi que membres de la bande.\n[10] Lisa Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de questions d\u2019entrevue pour les candidats, en collaboration avec le d\u00e9partement des ressources humaines du Grand conseil de Prince Albert, un organisme cadre compos\u00e9 de douze Premi\u00e8res Nations de la Saskatchewan, y compris la bande. Les questions ont ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par le Conseil de bande. Les entrevues ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues par une formation compos\u00e9e du chef et des quatre autres membres du Conseil de bande, ainsi que de deux repr\u00e9sentants du d\u00e9partement des ressources humaines du Grand conseil, d\u2019un a\u00een\u00e9 de la bande et de Lisa Cook.\n[11] Les membres du groupe d\u2019entrevue devaient, chacun \u00e0 leur tour, poser une ou deux questions \u00e0 chacun des candidats. On avait fourni aux membres du groupe d\u2019entrevue des feuilles sur lesquelles les questions \u00e9taient \u00e9crites et o\u00f9 il y avait de l\u2019espace pour inscrire des notes. Lisa Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la fin des entrevues, les membres du groupe ont discut\u00e9 entre eux des r\u00e9sultats qu\u2019ils avaient donn\u00e9s \u00e0 chacun des candidats. Elle a \u00e9crit les points donn\u00e9s par chaque membre du groupe sur un tableau. Elle a ensuite fait la moyenne des r\u00e9sultats pour chacun des candidats.\n[12] Mme Deschambeault a obtenu la premi\u00e8re place. Mme Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait pris les r\u00e9sultats et les avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 une r\u00e9union du Conseil de bande. On lui a demand\u00e9 de quitter la pi\u00e8ce pendant que le Conseil de bande d\u00e9lib\u00e9rait. Mme Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait trouv\u00e9 cette demande surprenante. L\u2019un des membres du Conseil lui a dit que [Traduction] [l]es membres de la bande vont s\u2019occuper des questions d\u2019appartenance \u00e0 la bande . Mme Cook fait partie de la Premi\u00e8re Nation, mais elle n\u2019est pas une membre de la bande.\n[13] Le Conseil de bande a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019embaucher Kathleen Settee-Cramer (Mme Cramer), qui est membre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation et membre de la bande. Les r\u00e9sultats du groupe d\u2019entrevue avaient plac\u00e9 Mme Cramer en deuxi\u00e8me place.\n[14] Patricia Laliberte avait agi \u00e0 titre de secr\u00e9taire pour le Conseil de bande pendant une p\u00e9riode de deux semaines en 2004. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union du Conseil de bande au cours de laquelle la question de la nomination au poste de facilitateur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e. Elle se souvient que certains membres du Conseil avaient mentionn\u00e9 que le candidat retenu devait \u00eatre un membre de la bande.\n[15] Lisa Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le lendemain, le chef de la bande \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et l\u2019un des membres du conseil de la bande lui ont tous les deux dit que Mme Cramer avait obtenu le poste parce que le Conseil avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019embaucher un membre de la bande.\n[16] Mme Cramer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e au poste, elle a entendu le m\u00eame conseiller qui avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cook dire qu\u2019elle avait obtenu le poste [Traduction] parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait membre de la bande . Elle a alors discut\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re, qui \u00e9tait un ancien chef de bande, au sujet de ce qu\u2019elle avait entendu. Apr\u00e8s avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, son p\u00e8re lui a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait membre de la bande. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que cette nouvelle l\u2019avait attrist\u00e9e. Elle \u00e9tait amie avec Mme Deschambeault depuis leur enfance et elle savait que Mme Deschambeault \u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9e qu\u2019elle. Elle a tout de m\u00eame d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019accepter le poste parce qu\u2019elle croyait qu\u2019elle pouvait tout de m\u00eame aider sa collectivit\u00e9 en ce qui avait trait au programme qu\u2019elle g\u00e9rerait.\n[17] Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, Mme Cramer a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Deschambeault ce qu\u2019elle avait appris au sujet du concours. Bien que Mme Deschambeault ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s bless\u00e9e et d\u00e9\u00e7ue de ne pas avoir obtenu le poste, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle e\u00fbt obtenu le premier rang dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du groupe qui avait tenu l\u2019entrevue, elle ne souhaitait pas causer de probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 Mme Cramer. Mme Deschambeault a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de laisser tomber la question et de ne pas d\u00e9poser de plainte aupr\u00e8s de la bande \u00e0 la suite du concours.\nB. Le concours de 2005 [18] Bien que la dur\u00e9e du poste de facilitateur \u00e9tait de deux ans, se terminant en 2006, Mme Cramer a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 du poste le 16 mars 2005. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle trouvait que l\u2019environnement de travail \u00e9tait [Traduction] malsain et qu\u2019elle se sentait [Traduction] harcel\u00e9e . Tout de suite apr\u00e8s sa d\u00e9mission, Mme Cramer a pos\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lection du Conseil de bande de ce mois-l\u00e0. Il semble que les r\u00e8glements de la bande pr\u00e9cisent que les candidats doivent d\u00e9missionner de leur emploi au sein de la bande pendant la p\u00e9riode des \u00e9lections. La bande soutient donc que la v\u00e9ritable raison pour laquelle Mme Cramer a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle souhaitait poser sa candidature au sein du Conseil. Mme Cramer n\u2019a pas obtenu de poste au sein du Conseil.\n[19] Peu importe le motif en ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa d\u00e9mission, le r\u00e9sultat a \u00e9t\u00e9 que le poste de facilitateur s\u2019est lib\u00e9r\u00e9 avant la fin de sa dur\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue. Lisa Cook \u00e9tait absente pour des raisons personnelles lorsque Mme Cramer a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9. \u00c0 son retour en avril 2005, Angus Mackenzie, un conseiller de bande qui venait d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9lu et \u00e0 qui on avait donn\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 du dossier de la sant\u00e9, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cook de pr\u00e9parer un processus de s\u00e9lection afin de combler le poste. La bande avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 diffus\u00e9 des annonces de l\u2019ouverture du poste pendant que Lisa Cook \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9.\n[20] Le Conseil de bande avait depuis peu mis sur pied un nouveau comit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 compos\u00e9 de quatre membres de la bande qui devaient appuyer le Conseil au sujet de questions portant sur le dossier de la sant\u00e9. On a avis\u00e9 Lisa Cook que le comit\u00e9 de sept membres qui \u00e9valuerait les candidatures pour le poste de facilitateur serait compos\u00e9 des quatre membres du comit\u00e9 sur la sant\u00e9 ainsi que d\u2019un ancien conseiller de la bande (Raymond Chaboyer), de M. Mackenzie, et d\u2019un a\u00een\u00e9. Mme Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le Grand conseil avait choisi de ne pas participer au processus d\u2019entrevue de 2005.\n[21] Le processus de s\u00e9lection que Lisa Cook a organis\u00e9 \u00e9tait semblable au concours de 2004 avec quelques changements mineurs. Par exemple, le pointage devait se faire sur une \u00e9chelle de 1 \u00e0 5 plut\u00f4t que de 1 \u00e0 4 et la partie portant sur l\u2019habilet\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019exprimer par \u00e9crit avait \u00e9t\u00e9 davantage d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e afin de garantir que les candidats avaient les capacit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires en mati\u00e8re de pr\u00e9paration de rapports. Cependant, ce dernier point ne comptait pas dans les r\u00e9sultats finaux que les membres du groupe donnaient aux candidats.\n[22] Trois personnes ont pos\u00e9 leur candidature pour le poste, Clara Cook, Mme Deschambeault, et Mme Cramer (qui, en effet, posait \u00e0 nouveau sa candidature pour le poste). Mme Deschambeault \u00e9tait la seule personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas membre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation et qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas membre de la bande \u00e0 poser sa candidature. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait vu les affiches pour le concours au bureau de poste et au poste d\u2019essence et qu\u2019elle avait entendu une annonce au poste de radio local. Elle avait remarqu\u00e9 que les qualifications requises et les t\u00e2ches n\u2019avaient pas chang\u00e9 par rapport au concours de 2004. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait rencontr\u00e9 le nouveau chef de bande, Walter Sewap, au poste d\u2019essence et qu\u2019elle lui avait demand\u00e9 si le concours allait \u00eatre restreint aux membres de la bande. Il lui avait r\u00e9pondu que le concours \u00e9tait ouvert \u00e0 tous, pas seulement aux membres de la bande, et que le nouveau comit\u00e9 sur la sant\u00e9 superviserait le processus et ferait une recommandation au Conseil. Elle s\u2019est sentie rassur\u00e9e et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de poser sa candidature.\n[23] Les entrevues ont eu lieu en mai 2005. Trois des membres du groupe d\u2019entrevue ont d\u00fb se r\u00e9cuser relativement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de Clara Cook parce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient parents. Les sept membres du groupe ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue de Mme Cramer et de Mme Deschambeault. Lisa Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle croyait que la candidature de Clara Cook n\u2019aurait jamais d\u00fb \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Les affiches pour le poste pr\u00e9cisaient que seules les personnes qui avaient termin\u00e9 leurs \u00e9tudes secondaires de 12e ann\u00e9e, ou l\u2019\u00e9quivalent, pouvaient postuler. Clara Cook n\u2019avait pas mentionn\u00e9 dans son curriculum vitae qu\u2019elle avait termin\u00e9 sa 12e ann\u00e9e. Cependant, on a dit \u00e0 Lisa Cook d\u2019admettre tous les candidats au concours, y compris Clara Cook.\n[24] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue des candidats, le groupe d\u2019entrevue s\u2019est r\u00e9uni et a compil\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats. Un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e9crit \u00e0 la main ou une feuille de calcul \u00e9tablissant tous les r\u00e9sultats attribu\u00e9s par chacun des membres du groupe d\u2019entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve. Ce document montre que chaque \u00e9valuateur a donn\u00e9 un r\u00e9sultat qui pla\u00e7ait Mme Deschambeault au premier rang ou qui la pla\u00e7ait ex \u00e6quo avec Mme Cramer au premier rang. Les quatre membres du groupe d\u2019entrevue qui ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 Clara Cook l\u2019ont plac\u00e9e au dernier rang ou ex \u00e6quo avec Mme Cramer au deuxi\u00e8me rang. La moyenne g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des r\u00e9sultats pla\u00e7ait clairement Mme Deschambeault au premier rang, avec un r\u00e9sultat de 55 sur 70, Clara Cook au deuxi\u00e8me rang avec 46 points, et Mme Cramer avec 42 points.\n[25] Il existait un certain nombre d\u2019anomalies \u00e9videntes dans les r\u00e9sultats. L\u2019un des membres du groupe d\u2019entrevue, Ernest Chaboyer, avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Deschambeault un r\u00e9sultat de 74, m\u00eame si le r\u00e9sultat maximal possible \u00e9tait de 70. Un examen des feuilles de pointage d\u2019Ernest Chaboyer pour chacune des candidates qu\u2019il avait interrog\u00e9es montrait qu\u2019il avait inscrit un r\u00e9sultat pour l\u2019une des questions d\u2019entrevue \u00e0 deux endroits sur la feuille de pointage, ce qui avait entra\u00een\u00e9 un calcul en double. Je note qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Deschambeault un r\u00e9sultat parfait pour toutes les questions d\u2019entrevue sauf une, pour laquelle il a donn\u00e9 4\/5. Cela donne \u00e0 penser que le r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019il souhaitait donner \u00e0 Mme Deschambeault \u00e9tait de 69\/70, qui est bien meilleur que le r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cramer (25\/70). Il n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 de r\u00e9sultats \u00e0 Mme Cook parce qu\u2019elle est sa s\u0153ur. N\u00e9anmoins, m\u00eame si on annulait tous les point attribu\u00e9s par Ernest Chaboyer du r\u00e9sultat total, la moyenne r\u00e9vis\u00e9e placerait tout de m\u00eame Mme Deschambeault en premi\u00e8re position.\n[26] Un autre probl\u00e8me, qui est ressorti gr\u00e2ce au t\u00e9moignage de Raymond Chaboyer, \u00e9tait que bien que les feuilles de pointage comprenaient des points attribu\u00e9s par l\u2019a\u00een\u00e9 qui avait particip\u00e9 au groupe d\u2019entrevue, M. Chaboyer ne se souvenait pas avoir vu cet a\u00een\u00e9 poser des questions ou inscrire des r\u00e9sultats sur sa feuille. Cependant, m\u00eame si on avait aussi annul\u00e9 les point attribu\u00e9s par l\u2019a\u00een\u00e9, en plus de ceux d\u2019Ernest Chaboyer, Mme Deschambeault aurait tout de m\u00eame obtenu la premi\u00e8re place.\n[27] Lisa Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le groupe d\u2019entrevue avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de recommander Mme Deschambeault au Conseil de bande pour le poste de facilitateur. Mme Deschambeault a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa preuve qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ce soir-l\u00e0 d\u2019Ernest Chaboyer qui l\u2019informait qu\u2019elle avait obtenu le plus haut r\u00e9sultat et que le groupe la recommanderait au Conseil. Il lui a m\u00eame demand\u00e9 \u00e0 quelle date elle pouvait commencer \u00e0 travailler.\n[28] Ernest Chaboyer a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un rapport des conclusions du groupe d\u2019entrevue recommandant l\u2019embauche de Mme Deschambeault, lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union du Conseil de bande le lendemain, soit le 16 mai 2005. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la question, le Conseil de bande a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019embaucher Clara Cook pour le poste de facilitateur, d\u00e9cision qui devait entrer en vigueur le jour m\u00eame.\n[29] Mme Deschambeault a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s bless\u00e9e et f\u00e2ch\u00e9e de perdre la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi une deuxi\u00e8me fois, particuli\u00e8rement apr\u00e8s qu\u2019Ernest Chaboyer lui eut dit, la veille, qu\u2019elle avait obtenu la premi\u00e8re place dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du groupe et qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9e pour l\u2019embauche. Elle estimait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait injuste qu\u2019on lui refuse le poste une deuxi\u00e8me fois apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut \u00e9t\u00e9 encore une fois la candidate qui avait obtenu le meilleur r\u00e9sultat. En juillet 2005, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 la Commission. La Commission l\u2019a avis\u00e9e qu\u2019elle devait fournir des pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 la plainte. Sa plainte modifi\u00e9e, que la Commission a finalement renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal et qui constitue la pr\u00e9sente affaire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2006. Le comportement discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte s\u2019\u00e9tend du 22 juillet 2004 au 16 mai 2005, p\u00e9riode qui couvre les concours de 2004 et de 2005.\nII. Quels sont les principes juridiques applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce? [30] Constitue un acte discriminatoire, aux termes de la LCDP, le fait de refuser d\u2019employer un individu en raison de son origine nationale ou ethnique (articles 3 et 7).\n[31] La partie plaignante doit d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28 (O\u2019Malley)). La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. Lorsque la partie plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, il revient \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication qui est raisonnable et qui n\u2019est pas un pr\u00e9texte pour justifier la pratique qui autrement serait discriminatoire.\n[32] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit le seul motif derri\u00e8re le comportement en question pour que la plainte soit justifi\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination soit l\u2019un des facteurs qui aient compt\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur (Holden c. Compagnie nationale de chemins de fer (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au paragraphe 7 (C.A.F.); Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba [1995] 2 C.F. 569 (C.F. 1re inst.)).\n[33] Dans Basic. Compagnie de chemins de fer du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, au paragraphe 38 481 (TCDP), le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la discrimination n\u2019est pas une pratique que l\u2019on s\u2019attend \u00e0 voir ouvertement. Il est rare que l\u2019on puisse \u00e9tablir par une preuve directe que la discrimination \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. Un tribunal doit donc tenir compte de toutes les circonstances afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe [Traduction] un l\u00e9ger relent de discrimination.\n[34] Dans le contexte de l\u2019emploi, les conclusions tir\u00e9es dans plusieurs d\u00e9cisions ont servi \u00e0 illustrer le type de preuve qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Dans Shakes c. Rex Pak Ltd., (1981), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, au paragraphe 8 918, la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ontario a conclu qu\u2019une preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 :\nque le plaignant \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour l\u2019emploi en question; que le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9; qu\u2019une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas la caract\u00e9ristique de distinction, qui est \u00e0 la base de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, a obtenu le poste.\n[35] Dans Israeli c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, \u00e0 la ligne 1 618 (TCDP), confirm\u00e9 (1984), 5 C.H.R.R. D\/2147 (TCDP \u2013 Tribunal de r\u00e9vision), le Tribunal a modifi\u00e9 cette analyse afin de prendre en compte les situations o\u00f9 aucune nomination n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite apr\u00e8s que le plaignant, qui \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9, et o\u00f9 l\u2019employeur continue de chercher des candidats.\n[36] Bien que les approches Shakes et Israeli servent de guides utiles, ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre ne devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e automatiquement de fa\u00e7on rigide ou arbitraire dans tous les cas portant sur l\u2019embauche (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (V\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154 (Morris), aux paragraphes 23 \u00e0 30; Singh c. Canada (Statistiques Canada) (1998), 34 C.H.R.R. D\/203, au paragraphe 161 (TCDP); Premakumar c. Air Canada, 2002 CanLII 23561, au paragraphe 77 (TCDP)). Il faut tenir compte des circonstances dans chaque plainte afin de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019application de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre crit\u00e8re, en entier ou en partie, est appropri\u00e9e.\nA. Mme Deschambeault a-t-elle \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination? [37] \u00c0 mon avis, Mme Deschambeault a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination en ce qui a trait aux concours de 2004 et de 2005. La preuve que la plaignante et la Commission ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e d\u00e9montre qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e pour le poste de facilitateur pour les deux concours, puisqu\u2019elle avait obtenu le premier rang parmi tous les candidats qui avaient particip\u00e9 aux deux concours. Elle n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e pour le poste. Enfin, la preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e que la plaignante (et qui en fait, \u00e9tait moins qualifi\u00e9e, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les groupes d\u2019entrevue qui avaient \u00e9valu\u00e9 les candidats lors des deux concours) a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e. Ces autres personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es n\u2019avaient pas la caract\u00e9ristique de distinction qui est \u00e0 la base de la plainte de Mme Deschambeault (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas M\u00e9tis, mais qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Cumberland Lake). Les trois composantes de l\u2019analyse Shakes ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies.\n[38] La bande soutient que le statut de Mme Deschambeault comme personne qui n\u2019est pas membre de la bande n\u2019est pas [Traduction] comme un descripteur de race ou d\u2019ethnicit\u00e9 au sens de l\u2019analyse . La bande soutient que, contrairement \u00e0 la race, il est possible d\u2019obtenir ou de perdre le statut de membre de la bande au cours de la vie d\u2019une personne. Par exemple, des femmes qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas membres de la bande le sont devenues lorsqu\u2019elles se sont mari\u00e9es \u00e0 un homme membre de la bande. D\u2019autres personnes ont obtenu leur statut d\u2019Indien en 1985, lors de l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C-31 (Loi modifiant la Loi sur les Indiens), qui a redonn\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses personnes le statut qu\u2019elles avaient perdu.\n[39] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Tout d\u2019abord, la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce porte sur la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, et non sur la race. La LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le traitement d\u00e9favorable d\u2019individus, fond\u00e9 sur leur origine nationale ou ethnique, constitue une pratique discriminatoire. La LCDP ne fait aucune distinction entre les personnes qui sont victimes de discrimination parce qu\u2019elles sont membres d\u2019un groupe national ou ethnique particulier et celles qui sont victimes de discrimination parce qu\u2019elles ne sont pas membres d\u2019un tel groupe.\n[40] Mme Deschambeault a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie selon laquelle on lui a refus\u00e9 un emploi parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas une certaine origine nationale ou ethnique. Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas membre d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation et, en particulier, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas membre de la Cumberland House Cree Nation. Le fait que Mme Deschambeault aurait pu obtenir plus tard le statut d\u2019Indien en \u00e9pousant un membre de la bande ne devrait faire aucune diff\u00e9rence, pas plus, par exemple, que le fait qu\u2019une victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la religion puisse possiblement se convertir \u00e0 une autre religion plus tard dans sa vie. Le fait qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 un certain moment, traitement fond\u00e9 sur leur statut actuel (r\u00e9el ou imaginaire qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, de leur religion, de leur \u00e9tat matrimonial, de leur orientation sexuelle, etc.) est suffisant pour conclure qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination.\n[41] La bande semble aussi donner \u00e0 entendre que tous les candidats, dans les deux concours, avaient la m\u00eame origine nationale ou ethnique puisque tant les Autochtones que les M\u00e9tis rel\u00e8vent tous deux de la d\u00e9finition de peuples autochtones du Canada au sens du paragraphe 35(2) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire des Indiens, des Inuits et des M\u00e9tis du Canada ). J\u2019en d\u00e9duis que la bande souhaiterait que le Tribunal conclue, en se fondant sur le libell\u00e9 de cette disposition constitutionnelle, qu\u2019il ne pouvait donc pas y avoir eu discrimination en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, bien que ses observations \u00e0 ce sujet ne soient pas tr\u00e8s explicites.\n[42] En supposant que ce soit l\u00e0 l\u2019argument que la bande pr\u00e9sente, je ne suis pas de son avis. Cela constituerait une d\u00e9finition beaucoup trop restrictive des mots origine nationale ou ethnique utilis\u00e9s dans la LCDP. Premi\u00e8rement, comme la Cour supr\u00eame l\u2019a not\u00e9 dans R. c Powley, 2003 CSC 43, au paragraphe 10, le terme M\u00e9tis de l\u2019article 35, bien qu\u2019il ne comprenne pas tous les individus d\u2019ascendance mixte am\u00e9rindienne et europ\u00e9enne, fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des peuples distincts qui ont une identit\u00e9 de groupe reconnaissable qui est distincte de celle de leurs anc\u00eatres am\u00e9rindiens, inuits ou europ\u00e9ens. De plus, dans un sens plus large, l\u2019argument de la bande semble ne pas tenir compte du fait que les peuples autochtones du Canada qui sont mentionn\u00e9s dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 sont compos\u00e9s de nombreux groupes nationaux ou ethniques qui poss\u00e8dent leurs propres cultures, langues, traditions et histoires. La bande semble donner \u00e0 entendre que le fait de traiter quelqu\u2019un de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9favorable en fonction de ces origines nationales ou ethniques devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment du fait de faire une distinction, par exemple, entre des personnes d\u2019origine nationale europ\u00e9enne, selon ce qu\u2019on entend historiquement par cette expression. Cela est manifestement absurde.\n[43] De toute fa\u00e7on, les dispositions de la LCDP n\u2019exigent pas que le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9 soient d\u2019origines nationales ou ethniques diff\u00e9rentes pour qu\u2019une plainte soit fond\u00e9e. L\u2019article 4 de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise que le Tribunal peut rendre une ordonnance au sujet de toute personne qui a commis ou qui commet un acte discriminatoire. Le Tribunal peut donc tout \u00e0 fait conclure qu\u2019une personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination commise par une personne de la m\u00eame origine, s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli que l\u2019origine de la victime \u00e9tait un facteur du traitement d\u00e9favorable.\n[44] Je conclus donc qu\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\nB. La bande a-t-elle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une explication raisonnable? (i) Le concours de 2004 [45] La bande n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve qui donnait d\u2019explication, encore moins une explication raisonnable, pour se justifier face \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de discrimination que la Commission et Mme Deschambeault ont \u00e9tablie.\n[46] La bande a appel\u00e9 trois t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audience : le chef Walter Sewap, Angus Mackenzie et Raymond Chaboyer. Le chef Sewap a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu \u00e0 son poste en avril 2005, juste avant le concours de 2005. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait donner aucun renseignement au sujet du concours de 2004 parce qu\u2019il ne faisait pas partie du Conseil de bande \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. M. Mackenzie n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu au Conseil qu\u2019en avril 2005. Il n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun t\u00e9moignage au sujet du concours de 2004.\n[47] Raymond Chaboyer \u00e9tait membre du Conseil de bande \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque du concours de 2004. Il n\u2019avait pas particip\u00e9 au groupe d\u2019entrevue qui avait \u00e9valu\u00e9 les candidats pour le poste de facilitateur cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Ce t\u00e9moin a souvent confondu le concours de 2005 et celui de 2004 dans son t\u00e9moignage. Lorsqu\u2019on lui a finalement demand\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire qui avait obtenu la premi\u00e8re place dans le concours de 2004, il ne s\u2019en souvenait pas. Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi le Conseil de bande n\u2019avait pas embauch\u00e9 Mme Deschambeault en 2004, malgr\u00e9 le fait que le groupe d\u2019entrevue l\u2019avait recommand\u00e9e, il ne s\u2019en souvenait pas, d\u00e9clarant que \u00e7a s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 il y avait trop longtemps. Enfin, le t\u00e9moignage de Raymond Chaboyer n\u2019a fourni aucune explication que ce soit pour la d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher Mme Deschambeault en 2004, d\u00e9cision pour laquelle j\u2019ai conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[48] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites finales, d\u00e9pos\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la fin de l\u2019audience, la bande a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 plusieurs arguments fond\u00e9s sur la preuve documentaire au sujet du concours de 2004. La bande a not\u00e9 un certain nombre d\u2019incoh\u00e9rences dans les documents de pointage (les questionnaires) au sujet du concours de 2004, qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve. Certains des membres du groupe d\u2019entrevue avaient apparemment \u00e9crit des r\u00e9sultats pour plusieurs des questions, alors que d\u2019autres ne l\u2019avaient pas fait. Cela aurait donc entra\u00een\u00e9 le fait que certains candidats auraient obtenu des r\u00e9sultats plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que d\u2019autres [Traduction] sans raison apparente . La bande a aussi soutenu que [Traduction] un ou plus d\u2019un des membres du groupe d\u2019entrevue ont [Traduction] abandonn\u00e9 le pointage sur une \u00e9chelle de 1 \u00e0 4 et ont donn\u00e9 un rang-centile g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il semblerait que Lisa Cook et un autre membre du groupe aient donn\u00e9 plus de points \u00e0 Mme Deschambeault qu\u2019aux autres candidats parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de casier judiciaire. De plus, ce ne sont pas tous les questionnaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s par les membres du groupe.\n[49] Ces explications sont, \u00e0 mon avis, de simples pr\u00e9textes, si elles ne sont pas simplement des r\u00e9flexions apr\u00e8s coup de la part de la bande, qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9sente dans un dernier effort pour se justifier. La plupart de ces incoh\u00e9rences n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es lors de l\u2019interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins. On n\u2019a pos\u00e9 aucune question \u00e0 Lisa Cook \u00e0 savoir pourquoi elle aurait donn\u00e9 des r\u00e9sultats diff\u00e9rents au sujet de l\u2019absence d\u2019un casier judiciaire pour les candidats. Les autres incoh\u00e9rences ont \u00e0 peine \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9es lors du contre-interrogatoire que la bande a fait des t\u00e9moins de la Commission. Ces points n\u2019ont certainement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9s par les t\u00e9moins de la bande.\n[50] Ce qui est encore plus important, c\u2019est qu\u2019aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e visant \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que ces suppos\u00e9es incoh\u00e9rences avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Conseil de bande en 2004, et que le Conseil les avait examin\u00e9es, lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter la recommandation du comit\u00e9 et d\u2019embaucher Mme Cramer plut\u00f4t que Mme Deschambeault.\n[51] La bande soutient que Mme Laliberte s\u2019est tromp\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet d\u2019un conseiller qui aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d\u2019embaucher un membre de la bande. La bande fait valoir que cette discussion portait sur la nomination d\u2019un directeur en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et non du facilitateur. La bande a aussi soulev\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que, lors de la r\u00e9union du Conseil, d\u2019autres discussions aient \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues en l\u2019absence de Mme Laliberte. Cependant, on ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve pour soutenir ces deux d\u00e9clarations. Je n\u2019ai aucune id\u00e9e du contexte ni du contenu de ces autres discussions. La bande n\u2019a m\u00eame pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de me pr\u00e9senter le compte rendu que Mme Laliberte avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 de cette r\u00e9union du Conseil. Par cons\u00e9quent, essentiellement on ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve qui contredise le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Laliberte.\n[52] En fait, je n\u2019ai pas la moindre preuve qui explique la raison pour laquelle la bande a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas embaucher Mme Deschambeault, malgr\u00e9 la recommandation du comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que la plaignante avait \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une explication, je conclus que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de Mme Deschambeault portant sur le concours de 2004 est justifi\u00e9e.\n(ii) Le concours de 2005 [53] Compte tenu de ma conclusion selon laquelle la plainte de Mme Deschambeault portant sur le concours de 2004 \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e, l\u2019examen de la plainte au sujet du concours de 2005 est, en un sens, th\u00e9orique. Le poste de facilitateur pour lequel elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature en 2004 devait \u00eatre un poste d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de deux ans. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que Mme Deschambeault ne serait pas rest\u00e9e en poste pendant ces deux ans si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e. Mme Cramer a quitt\u00e9 le poste pour des raisons personnelles environ huit mois apr\u00e8s son embauche. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle sentait le besoin de partir en raison d\u2019un environnement de travail [Traduction] malsain et parce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] harcel\u00e9e par au moins un des conseillers. Elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que le Conseil n\u2019\u00e9tait pas coop\u00e9ratif, en partie parce qu\u2019elle avait une r\u00e9putation d\u2019activiste et de fauteuse de troubles au sein de la collectivit\u00e9. La bande a soutenu qu\u2019elle avait simplement d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 afin de tenter d\u2019obtenir un poste au Conseil, comme le d\u00e9montre sa d\u00e9cision de poser \u00e0 nouveau sa candidature pour le poste de facilitateur en 2005 apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle n\u2019eut pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lue au Conseil. Peu importe la d\u00e9claration qui refl\u00e8te le mieux la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il n\u2019y a aucune raison de croire que Mme Deschambeault aurait quitt\u00e9 son poste avant la fin de son mandat. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de tenir un concours en 2005.\n[54] De plus, je conclus que l\u2019explication de la bande pour le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas embauch\u00e9 Mme Deschambeault en 2005, malgr\u00e9 la recommandation du comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue, n\u2019est pas raisonnable compte tenu de la preuve ou qu\u2019elle ne sert que de pr\u00e9texte pour justifier la pratique discriminatoire.\n[55] La bande soutient que le r\u00f4le du comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue en 2005 \u00e9tait simplement de pr\u00e9senter une recommandation au Conseil de bande, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de la suivre. Le Conseil se gardait le droit de prendre sa propre d\u00e9cision au sujet du candidat retenu. Le chef Sewap a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le Conseil \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 outre \u00e0 d\u2019autres recommandations d\u2019embauche par le pass\u00e9, un point que Lisa Cook a aussi confirm\u00e9.\n[56] Cependant, dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, cet argument n\u2019est pas pertinent. Bien que le Conseil de bande puisse avoir le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de nommer le candidat qui lui plait, et m\u00eame de rejeter la recommandation d\u2019un comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue, il ne peut pas le faire en se fondant sur des motifs discriminatoires. M\u00eame si un seul un motif discriminatoire fait partie des nombreux facteurs de sa d\u00e9cision, alors la bande aura contrevenu \u00e0 la LCDP (voir Holden, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9). Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas suffisant pour un intim\u00e9 de simplement soutenir, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une preuve prima facie de discrimination, que [Traduction] la d\u00e9cision finale revenait au Conseil de bande et qu\u2019il avait le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019embaucher le candidat qu\u2019il souhaitait. Compte tenu de la preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce portant sur le fait que la plaignante \u00e9tait la candidate la plus qualifi\u00e9e, la bande devait au moins pr\u00e9senter des preuves donnant \u00e0 penser que Clara Cook \u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9e que Mme Deschambeault ou expliquant pourquoi elle avait gagn\u00e9 le concours.\n[57] La Commission a fait allusion aux incoh\u00e9rences relev\u00e9es dans le processus de pointage du concours de 2005 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t (le r\u00e9sultat total de 74 sur 70 qu\u2019Ernest Chaboyer a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Deschambeault et la participation de l\u2019a\u00een\u00e9 au processus de pointage). Raymond Chaboyer a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter les r\u00e9sultats du pointage. Le chef Sewap a aussi mentionn\u00e9 que ces r\u00e9sultats le pr\u00e9occupaient. Ils ont tous les deux d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces pr\u00e9occupations avaient fait partie des facteurs qui avaient compt\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande. Pourtant, on ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune autre pr\u00e9cision au sujet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Conseil. Quels facteurs le Conseil a-t-il r\u00e9ellement examin\u00e9s? Comment a\u2011t\u2011on \u00e9valu\u00e9 les candidats si l\u2019on a \u00e9cart\u00e9 les recommandations du comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue? Lorsqu\u2019on a d\u00e9couvert les incoh\u00e9rences, pourquoi le Conseil n\u2019a-t-il pas renvoy\u00e9 la question au comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue pour une nouvelle \u00e9valuation? Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, si la bande avait des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet d\u2019incoh\u00e9rences, l\u2019\u00e9limination des r\u00e9sultats incoh\u00e9rents aurait tout de m\u00eame produit le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat : Mme Deschambeault serait sortie en t\u00eate des candidats, devant Mme Cramer et Clara Cook. Alors, pourquoi Clara Cook a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie? De plus, si les incoh\u00e9rences avaient entra\u00een\u00e9 des doutes au sujet de la fiabilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du processus, sur quel fondement la bande a-t-elle pris la d\u00e9cision d\u2019embaucher Clara Cook? On n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces questions dans la preuve.\n[58] Le t\u00e9moignage de Raymond Chaboyer \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement faible \u00e0 ce sujet. Il a souvent confondu le processus de 2004 (auquel il n\u2019aurait particip\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de conseiller) et le processus de 2005 (auquel il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de membre du comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue et ensuite \u00e0 titre de membre du Conseil). Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait absolument pas confiance envers le [Traduction] processus, soutenant que Lisa Cook avait [Traduction] fabriqu\u00e9 les questionnaires, qui avaient simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] distribu\u00e9s aux membres du comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue et \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame. Lisa Cook et le chef Sewap ont cependant t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les questions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019avance par le Conseil de bande. Raymond Chaboyer a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison de son manque de confiance envers le processus, il ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas [Traduction] donn\u00e9 la peine d\u2019inscrire un pointage pour les candidats. Cependant, la feuille de pointage contenant les r\u00e9sultats du comit\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Conseil montre que Raymond Chaboyer a bien particip\u00e9 au processus de pointage. Il a reconnu en contre\u2011interrogatoire qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas s\u2019il avait inscrit des r\u00e9sultats.\n[59] Soit dit en passant, Clara Cook est la s\u0153ur de Raymond Chaboyer. La feuille de pointage d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 au pointage du comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue au sujet de sa candidature. Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e quant \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9cus\u00e9 des discussions du Conseil au sujet de la candidature de Clara Cook, mais le compte rendu d\u00e9montre qu\u2019un conseiller, qui n\u2019est pas nomm\u00e9, s\u2019\u00e9tait abstenu.\n[60] La bande soutient que bien que les souvenirs de Raymond Chaboyer [Traduction] puissent \u00eatre moins que parfaits, rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou son honn\u00eatet\u00e9 seraient compromises. L\u2019honn\u00eatet\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin n\u2019est pas en question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, mais il convient plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer si son t\u00e9moignage apporte une preuve quelconque \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9ponse de la bande \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de discrimination. \u00c0 ce sujet, ses souvenirs moins que parfaits affaiblissent s\u00e9rieusement son t\u00e9moignage, de telle sorte que tr\u00e8s peu de poids peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ce t\u00e9moignage.\n[61] L\u2019explication de la bande au sujet de l\u2019importance de ces incoh\u00e9rences ne m\u2019a pas convaincu. Il n\u2019y a vraiment gu\u00e8re de preuve soutenant l\u2019argument selon lequel le Conseil ait m\u00eame tenu compte des incoh\u00e9rences dans sa d\u00e9cision. Comme je viens de l\u2019expliquer, le t\u00e9moignage de Raymond Chaboyer n\u2019a pratiquement aucun poids. Le t\u00e9moignage du chef Sewap \u00e0 ce sujet soul\u00e8ve des doutes parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 comment les suppos\u00e9es incoh\u00e9rences dans le pointage ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par le Conseil et quels facteurs ont r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s avant que la d\u00e9cision soit rendue d\u2019embaucher Clara Cook. \u00c0 mon avis, la bande n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli d\u2019explication.\n[62] De plus, m\u00eame si la bande avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait effectivement souci\u00e9 des incoh\u00e9rences en mati\u00e8re de pointage, la question de savoir pourquoi Clara Cook avait \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie plut\u00f4t que Mme Deschambeault reste sans r\u00e9ponse, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la preuve au sujet des probl\u00e8mes de pointage ne constitue pas une r\u00e9ponse raisonnable \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de discrimination, ce qui me porte \u00e0 conclure que la bande a soulev\u00e9 cette question comme simple pr\u00e9texte pour justifier sa pratique discriminatoire.\n[63] Le plainte de Mme Deschambeault au sujet du concours de 2005 est donc justifi\u00e9e aussi.\nC. La d\u00e9cision de la bande est-elle prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre l\u2019application de la LCDP en raison de l\u2019article 67? [64] La bande soutient que, peu importe mes conclusions au sujet des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans la plainte de Mme Deschambeault, sa d\u00e9cision au sujet du poste de facilitateur n\u2019est pas touch\u00e9e par l\u2019application de la LCDP en raison de l\u2019article 67 et qu\u2019ainsi, la question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9passe la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. Les observations de la bande \u00e0 ce sujet ne me convainquent pas.\n[65] L\u2019article 67 pr\u00e9voit :\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi est sans effet sur la Loi sur les Indiens et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi.\nNothing in this Act affects any provision of the Indian Act or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act.\n[66] Il est reconnu que la Cumberland House Cree Nation est une bande au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1985, ch. I\u20115. Pour pouvoir invoquer l\u2019article 67, la bande doit d\u00e9montrer que les articles de la LCDP qui sont appliqu\u00e9s dans l\u2019instruction d\u2019une plainte par le Tribunal affecteront une disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens ou les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi. L\u2019expression les dispositions prises en vertu de [la Loi sur les Indiens] de l\u2019article 67 touche toute d\u00e9cision prise en vertu de cette loi (voir Re. Desjarlais (1989), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/466, au paragraphe 10 (C.A.F.)). \u00c0 mon avis, la bande n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli ce lien.\n[67] La bande soutient que le poste de facilitateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour aider \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 des membres de la bande qui avaient souffert des r\u00e9percussions de leur vie en pensionnat. De tels probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, soutient-elle, [Traduction] rel\u00e8vent tout \u00e0 fait des responsabilit\u00e9s du Conseil de bande, qui [Traduction] a le pouvoir de traiter de telles questions en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens . En particulier, la bande mentionne les [Traduction] pouvoirs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 81(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, y compris le pouvoir concernant l\u2019adoption de mesures relatives \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 des habitants de la r\u00e9serve (alin\u00e9a 81(1)a)) et toute question qui d\u00e9coule de l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs pr\u00e9vus par le pr\u00e9sent article, ou qui y est accessoire (alin\u00e9a 81(1)q)).\n[68] Cependant, cet argument est trompeur. Le paragraphe 81(1) n\u2019\u00e9nonce pas les pouvoirs d\u2019une bande comme tels, mais plut\u00f4t les raisons pour lesquelles la bande peut prendre un r\u00e8glement. La liste des raisons qui se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019article 81 et aux articles suivants est tr\u00e8s exhaustive et a une grande port\u00e9e. Elle comprend les dispositions pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es au sujet des soins m\u00e9dicaux pour les r\u00e9sidents de la r\u00e9serve, mais aussi la r\u00e9glementation de la circulation, l\u2019observation de la loi et le maintien de l\u2019ordre, l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et l\u2019entretien de routes, ponts et autres ouvrages locaux, l\u2019arpentage des terres de la r\u00e9serve et leur r\u00e9partition entre les membres de la bande, l\u2019imposition de taxes et la d\u00e9livrance de permis aux entreprises, l\u2019affectation et le d\u00e9boursement de l\u2019argent de la bande et de nombreuses autres dispositions. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, rien ne d\u00e9montre que la bande a pris des r\u00e8glements au sujet des d\u00e9cisions portant sur l\u2019entente avec la Fondation autochtone de gu\u00e9rison et des d\u00e9cisions portant sur la dotation du poste de facilitateur.\n[69] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l\u2019argument de la bande selon lequel sa simple capacit\u00e9 de prendre des r\u00e8glements au sujet de ces questions appelle implicitement l\u2019application de l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 67. L\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Re. Desjarlais, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 12, donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019\u00e0 tout le moins, un r\u00e8glement doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 en vertu des articles 81 et suivants de la Loi sur les Indiens pour que la bande puisse soulever la question de l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP. Il y a une justification \u00e9vidente pour cette conclusion. Si chacun des objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux articles 81 et suivants constituait une [Traduction] disposition au sens de l\u2019article 67, m\u00eame si aucun r\u00e8glement n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pris, cela aurait pour effet serait de prot\u00e9ger pratiquement toutes les d\u00e9cisions d\u2019un Conseil de bande contre l\u2019application de la LCDP. Une telle interpr\u00e9tation ne respecterait pas la r\u00e8gle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Zurich Insurance Co. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [1992] 2 R.C.S. 321, \u00e0 la page 339, selon laquelle les exceptions aux lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter restrictivement.\n[70] Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Shubenacadie Band Council c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) (1997), 31 C.H.R.R. D\/347, au paragraphe 29, confirm\u00e9 2000 CanLII 15308 (C.A.F.), si l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger toutes les d\u00e9cisions des conseils de bande contre l\u2019application de la LCDP, le l\u00e9gislateur aurait pr\u00e9vu des dispositions portant express\u00e9ment sur ce sujet plut\u00f4t que de r\u00e9diger l\u2019article 67. Cet article prot\u00e8ge les d\u00e9cisions autoris\u00e9es par la Loi sur les Indiens et par son r\u00e8glement, mais ne prot\u00e8ge pas toutes les d\u00e9cisions prises par les conseils de bande autochtones.\n[71] La bande soutient que l\u2019affaire Shubenacadie se distingue de celle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce parce qu\u2019on avait conclu que les paiements d\u2019aide sociale financ\u00e9e par le gouvernement qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9s aux plaignants dans cette affaire \u00e9taient destin\u00e9s au public au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ils leur \u00e9taient [Traduction] garantis . En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la bande soutient qu\u2019elle avait le pouvoir, en vertu de son entente avec la Fondation, de doter le poste de facilitateur \u00e0 son gr\u00e9. Mme Deschambeault n\u2019avait aucun [Traduction] droit garanti quant au poste. Je ne vois pas la pertinence de cette distinction quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si la bande peut avoir recours \u00e0 l\u2019article 67.\n[72] Pour appuyer ses observations au sujet de l\u2019article 67, la bande se fonde sur les conclusions de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Conseil de la bande de Gordon, [2001] 1 C.F. 124 (Laslo). \u00c0 mon avis, la bande se trompe. Dans cette affaire, la plaignante \u00e9tait une Indienne inscrite qui habitait dans la r\u00e9serve de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Gordon avec son \u00e9poux qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas Indien. Sa demande de logement aupr\u00e8s de la bande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e et elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et la situation de famille. L\u2019intim\u00e9e avait soulev\u00e9 l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP comme d\u00e9fense. Comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la bande de Gordon n\u2019avait pas pris de r\u00e8glement au sujet de la question en litige (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019allocation d\u2019une maison), soit un r\u00e8glement en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 81(1)i), qui autorise la prise de r\u00e8glement pour l\u2019arpentage et la r\u00e9partition des terres entre les membres de la bande.\n[73] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a souscrit \u00e0 la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle il n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre l\u2019affaire. La cour a conclu, au paragraphe 26, que l\u2019article 67 s\u2019applique aux d\u00e9cisions qui, en vertu de leur objet, rel\u00e8vent du pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 express\u00e9ment par une disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que la d\u00e9cision de la bande dans cette affaire \u00e9tait express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 20 de la Loi sur les Indiens. L\u2019article 20 pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019 un Indien n\u2019est l\u00e9galement en possession d\u2019une terre dans une r\u00e9serve que si, avec l\u2019approbation du ministre, possession de la terre lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par le conseil de la bande.\n[74] La cour a conclu qu\u2019en raison du libell\u00e9 implicite de cette disposition, le Conseil de bande avait n\u00e9cessairement le pouvoir, en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, de d\u00e9cider de fa\u00e7on discr\u00e9tionnaire si elle accordait une terre \u00e0 un membre de la bande. La reconnaissance de ce pouvoir aux termes de l\u2019article 20 sous-entendait donc n\u00e9cessairement que de telles d\u00e9cisions \u00e9taient conformes aux dispositions prises en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens. C\u2019\u00e9tait le fondement de la d\u00e9cision de la cour en faveur de la bande dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Laslo. Je note cependant que la cour n\u2019a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la simple capacit\u00e9 de prendre un r\u00e8glement en vertu des articles 81 et suivants constitue pour la bande un pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 express\u00e9ment de prise de d\u00e9cision en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[75] Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Laslo, la bande en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 devant le Tribunal une disposition semblable dans la Loi sur les Indiens qui lui conf\u00e9rait express\u00e9ment un pouvoir de prise de d\u00e9cision portant sur la dotation du poste de facilitateur en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Dans ses observations finales, la bande a mentionn\u00e9 son r\u00e8glement interne portant sur la gestion du personnel des Programmes \/ Institutions \/ Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de la Cumberland House Cree Nation, qui selon la bande a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 [Traduction] conform\u00e9ment aux droits inh\u00e9rents et reconnus par la loi des Premi\u00e8res Nations de fonctionner \u00e0 titre d\u2019employeurs . La bande fait valoir que ce r\u00e8glement constitue [Traduction] la preuve d\u2019un pouvoir semblable \u00e0 celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Gordon . Cependant, ce r\u00e8glement n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve au Tribunal. Ce qui est encore plus important est que, sauf pour l\u2019argument g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la bande au sujet d\u2019un [Traduction] pouvoir semblable \u00e0 celui de l\u2019affaire Gordon, aucun lien \u00e0 une disposition pr\u00e9cise de la Loi sur les Indiens n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli comme source de ce pouvoir [Traduction] semblable de prise de d\u00e9cision express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[76] Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas convaincu que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande au sujet de la dotation du poste de facilitateur, prise en vertu de son entente avec la Fondation autochtone de gu\u00e9rison, d\u00e9coulait d\u2019un pouvoir express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par une disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019argument de la bande au sujet de l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9.\nIII. Quelles sont les r\u00e9parations que Mme Deschambeault et la Commission demandent? A. Pertes de salaire (alin\u00e9a 53(2)c)) [77] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une victime peut \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e de la totalit\u00e9 ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte discriminatoire. Mme Deschambeault a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le salaire annuel pour le poste de facilitateur \u00e9tait de 40 000 $. La bande n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve contredisant cette d\u00e9claration. Si Mme Deschambeault avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e en 2004, elle aurait travaill\u00e9 pendant six mois cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Cependant, elle a continu\u00e9 d\u2019occuper son poste au Pine Island Health Centre, o\u00f9 elle a continu\u00e9 de gagner un salaire moins \u00e9lev\u00e9. Ses pertes de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9es par le d\u00e9faut de la bande de l\u2019embaucher en 2004 sont, par cons\u00e9quent, les suivantes :\n2004 :\n-\n20 000 $ (Salaire du poste de facilitateur pour le reste de 2004) 11 250 $ (Salaire gagn\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement pour le reste de l\u2019ann\u00e9e) 8 750 $\n2005 :\n-\n40 000 $ (Salaire annuel du poste de facilitateur) 21 828 $ (Salaire r\u00e9ellement gagn\u00e9) 18 172 $\n2006 :\n-\n20 000 $ (Salaire pour le poste de facilitateur jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin du contrat) 14 063 $ (Salaire r\u00e9ellement gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame date) 5 937 $\nPertes de salaire totales : 32 859 $\nLe Tribunal ordonne donc \u00e0 la bande de payer \u00e0 Mme Deschambeault le montant de 32 859 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire.\nB. D\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es (alin\u00e9a 53(2)c)) (i) D\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 la formation [78] Une victime peut recevoir une indemnit\u00e9 pour la totalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par la pratique discriminatoire (alin\u00e9a 53(2)c)). D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019entente entre la bande et la Fondation autochtone de gu\u00e9rison, le facilitateur devait obtenir une formation, d\u00e9crite comme des [Traduction] modules de gu\u00e9rison d\u2019une semaine pour la \u2018formation du formateur\u2019 . Mme Deschambeault soutient que ces modules lui auraient donn\u00e9 une formation et une exp\u00e9rience suffisantes pour garder un emploi dans tout [Traduction] domaine li\u00e9 aux services sociaux . Comme on lui avait refus\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir cette formation, elle a [Traduction] fait le choix de quitter son emploi au Pine Island Health Centre et de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, en 2005, \u00e0 Saskatoon, o\u00f9 elle s\u2019est inscrite au Programme de justice p\u00e9nale du Coll\u00e8ge Regency. Cependant, la preuve donne \u00e0 penser que son emploi au centre de sant\u00e9 se serait termin\u00e9 de toute fa\u00e7on si elle n\u2019avait pas pris de mesures visant \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer sa formation. Il y avait eu un changement \u00e0 la gestion et de nouvelles politiques d\u2019emploi avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es.\n[79] Mme Deschambeault a termin\u00e9 son programme en 2006 et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019inscrire au Programme de dipl\u00f4me en counselling en mati\u00e8re de toxicomanie qui se donnait \u00e0 l\u2019Institut des sciences appliqu\u00e9es et des techniques de la Saskatchewan. Elle a donc d\u00fb d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 nouveau, cette fois \u00e0 Prince Albert.\n[80] Mme Deschambeault demande ainsi \u00e0 la bande de l\u2019indemniser pour les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle a faites en raison de cette formation, y compris les frais de scolarit\u00e9, le logement et les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 son v\u00e9hicule. Cependant, je ne suis pas convaincu que les modules qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7us dans le poste de facilitateur sont \u00e9quivalents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7ue depuis 2005, formation qui lui a permis d\u2019obtenir un nouvel emploi en 2008 dans un institut de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 Montreal Lake (Saskatchewan). Mme Deschambeault a choisi, de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s responsable, de transformer la malchance qu\u2019elle avait eu avec la bande en une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019am\u00e9liorer ses qualifications acad\u00e9miques et son exp\u00e9rience. Pour cela, elle m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre f\u00e9licit\u00e9e. Cependant, les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entra\u00een\u00e9es par les actes discriminatoires de la bande, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de la bande pour ces d\u00e9penses.\n(ii) Autres d\u00e9penses [81] Mme Deschambeault a engag\u00e9 d\u2019autres d\u00e9penses en raison des actes discriminatoires qui font l\u2019objet de la plainte. Ces d\u00e9penses comprennent :\nFrais de photocopies\n150 $\nFrais d\u2019administration, reliures (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire papeterie)\n48,98 $\nFrais de d\u00e9placement du village de Cumberland House \u00e0 Prince Albert et voyage de retour pour participer \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation (pour elle et pour Mme Cramer qui l\u2019a accompagn\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation)\n547,60 $\nH\u00e9bergement et repas pour la m\u00e9diation\n84 $\nTotal :\n830,58 $\n[82] Mme Deschambeault a droit \u00e0 ce que la bande l\u2019indemnise pour les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle a d\u00fb faire en raison des actes discriminatoires qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[83] Cependant, je ne suis pas convaincu, apr\u00e8s examen de la preuve, qu\u2019elle a engag\u00e9 les frais qu\u2019elle d\u00e9clare en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la location d\u2019un ordinateur portable. Cette r\u00e9clamation de d\u00e9pense est rejet\u00e9e.\n[84] De plus, l\u2019affaire ne soul\u00e8ve aucune circonstance exceptionnelle qui justifie l\u2019indemnisation de Mme Deschambeault pour le temps dont elle a eu besoin afin de pr\u00e9parer l\u2019affaire (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Lambie (1996), 29 C.H.R.R. D\/483, au paragraphe 41 (C.F. 1re inst.).\nC. Pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e)) [85] La victime d\u2019acte discriminatoire peut \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ pour tout pr\u00e9judice moral dont elle a souffert. Mme Deschambeault a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la tristesse et de la d\u00e9ception qu\u2019elle avait ressenties parce qu\u2019on lui avait refus\u00e9 un poste qu\u2019elle souhaitait ardemment obtenir et pour lequel elle se sentait plus que comp\u00e9tente. Il lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement douloureux d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019on lui avait refus\u00e9 cette possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas membre de la Cumberland House Cree Nation. Elle a aussi exprim\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ception au sujet du fait qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas contribuer, comme elle croyait pouvoir le faire, au processus de gu\u00e9rison de la collectivit\u00e9 qui comprend essentiellement le village autant que la r\u00e9serve. Les r\u00e9sidents ne partagent pas seulement des \u00e9tablissements comme les \u00e9coles et les ar\u00e9nas, mais ils vivent c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te, M\u00e9tis et Premi\u00e8re Nation, particuli\u00e8rement dans le village. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne se sentait plus chez elle au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 dans laquelle elle avait grandi.\n[86] Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, Mme Deschambeault a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de 8 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\nD. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (paragraphe 53(3)) [87] Le paragraphe 53(3) pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. \u00c0 mon avis, il existe des preuves selon lesquelles la bande a agi de fa\u00e7on inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e en posant les actes discriminatoires en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle a choisi de refuser une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Mme Deschambeault pour laquelle elle \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb obtenir, puisqu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait class\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re place, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas membre de la bande. La preuve ne pr\u00e9sente aucune autre justification. La bande a eu comme attitude qu\u2019elle peut faire ce qu\u2019il lui pla\u00eet, d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019elle avait tous les droits de nommer la personne qui lui convenait, comme si elle pouvait agir en faisant fi des droits des autres quand il est question des droits de la personne.\n[88] Compte tenu des circonstances, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 la bande de payer \u00e0 Mme Deschambeault 5 000 $ en indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, en vertu du paragraphe 53(3).\nE. Int\u00e9r\u00eats [89] L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat est payable pour toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision (paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP). Il s\u2019agira d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats simples calcul\u00e9s annuellement en fonction du taux d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat commencera \u00e0 courir \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire et pour pr\u00e9judice moral ainsi qu\u2019en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat portant sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites apparemment apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, commencera \u00e0 courir \u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nF. Ordonnance de mesures de redressement ou de mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables (alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)) [90] La Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP pour que la bande travaille avec elle afin de garantir que les pratiques d\u2019embauche \u00e0 venir respectent la LCDP. Compte tenu de mes conclusions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019ordonnance est justifi\u00e9e. La demande de la Commission est accueillie.\n[91] J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 la bande de prendre des mesures, en consultant la Commission sur les objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de ces mesures, visant \u00e0 \u00e9viter que de tels actes discriminatoires, ou des actes semblables, se reproduisent \u00e0 l\u2019avenir.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION\n[1] Le 30 mai 2005, Evelyn London (la plaignante) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux plaintes \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Dans l'une des plaintes, elle soutient que le New Brunswick Aboriginal Peoples Council (le NBAPC) a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle, en contravention avec les articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). Dans l'autre plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Barry LaBillois, son superviseur au NBAPC, elle soutient qu'il a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle, en contravention avec l'article 14 de la Loi. Dans les deux plaintes, elle soutient que les intim\u00e9s ont commis des actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou l'origine ethnique.\n[2] Les intim\u00e9s nient les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante.\n[3] Les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des avocats \u00e0 l'audience. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience.\nII. LES FAITS [4] La plaignante est d'origine mal\u00e9cite et micmaque. Les collectivit\u00e9s mal\u00e9cites et micmaques sont les deux plus grandes collectivit\u00e9s autochtones de la province du Nouveau-Brunswick.\n[5] Le NBAPC a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 en 1972. Il repr\u00e9sente les Autochtones qui n'habitent pas dans les r\u00e9serves ou qui n'ont pas de statut et les personnes m\u00e9tis du Nouveau-Brunswick. L'organisation comprend des Autochtones d'origine micmaque, mal\u00e9cite, ojibway, passamaquoddy et crie. Pour devenir membre du NBAPC, une personne doit s'identifier comme \u00e9tant une personne autochtone et doit fournir des documents permettant d'\u00e9tablir ses origines autochtones. Les Autochtones sans statut doivent fournir un certificat de naissance qui \u00e9tablit que l'un de leurs parents est d'origine autochtone.\n[6] Le NBAPC est constitu\u00e9 de sections locales compos\u00e9es de diverses collectivit\u00e9s d'Autochtones qui n'habitent pas dans des r\u00e9serves. D'apr\u00e8s la charte du NBAPC, une section locale peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie lorsque cinq membres autochtones r\u00e9sident dans une m\u00eame zone g\u00e9ographique. Ces personnes ne doivent pas habiter \u00e0 plus de dix kilom\u00e8tres de distance les unes des autres. Les sections locales sont regroup\u00e9es en diff\u00e9rentes zones. Il existe sept zones au Nouveau-Brunswick. Chaque zone doit \u00e9lire un repr\u00e9sentant au conseil du NBAPC. Le pr\u00e9sident du conseil porte aussi le nom de chef. Betty Ann Lavallee est pr\u00e9sidente et chef du NBAPC depuis 2000. La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 membre du NBAPC de la fin des ann\u00e9es 1970 jusqu'en 2002, auquel moment elle a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son statut de membre.\n[7] Barry LaBillois est d'origine micmaque et, pour toute la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente plainte, il \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 du NBAPC. De fa\u00e7on plus pr\u00e9cise, il occupait le poste de coordinateur des p\u00eaches autochtones.\n[8] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e comme secr\u00e9taire et commis comptable au NBAPC pour le Programme des p\u00eaches autochtones le 19 juin 2000. Son poste visait \u00e0 aider le superviseur du Programme des p\u00eaches autochtones. Entre le 19 juin 2000 et ao\u00fbt 2001, Phillip Fraser a \u00e9t\u00e9 son superviseur.\n[9] En ao\u00fbt 2001, apr\u00e8s que Phillip Fraser ait quitt\u00e9 le NBAPC pour un nouvel emploi, l'intim\u00e9 Barry LaBillois a pris le poste de superviseur. Le 24 janvier 2002, on a offert \u00e0 la plaignante le poste de monitrice des p\u00eaches autochtones. La chef Lavallee a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante qu'elle devrait aussi continuer d'occuper le poste de secr\u00e9taire et de commis comptable jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'on trouve un rempla\u00e7ant pour prendre ce poste. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, la plaignante n'a soulev\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9occupation au sujet du fait que Barry LaBillois serait son superviseur.\n[10] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa relation de travail avec Barry LaBillois n'\u00e9tait pas bonne. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'il lui avait dit qu'il \u00e9tait le patron et qu'elle devait faire ce qu'on lui disait sans poser de questions. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'avant qu'il devienne son superviseur, elle l'avait entendu prof\u00e9rer des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes contre les Mal\u00e9cites, mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de pr\u00e9ciser quand ces remarques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9es, sauf dans le cas d'un incident que je mentionnerai plus tard.\nA. L'incident au sujet de la distribution de homards [11] Le premier incident que la plaignante a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 comme acte de harc\u00e8lement a eu lieu en septembre 2001, pendant la pr\u00e9paration de homards qui devaient \u00eatre distribu\u00e9s aux membres du NBAPC. Cet incident a eu lieu \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du milieu de travail, \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de Carol LaBillois-Slocum, la sur de Barry LaBillois. Carol LaBillois-Slocum \u00e9tait alors agente des communications du NBAPC. Elle occupe maintenant le poste de vice-chef.\n[12] La plaignante soutient qu'en raison des t\u00e2ches attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 son poste, Barry LaBillois lui avait demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sente. Jason Harquail, un autre coll\u00e8gue, \u00e9tait aussi pr\u00e9sent, tout comme Carol LaBillois-Slocum, son mari et Barry LaBillois.\n[13] Les t\u00e2ches de la plaignante pour la journ\u00e9e \u00e9taient de faire cuire le homard et de le placer dans une chambre froide pour qu'il refroidisse.\n[14] D'apr\u00e8s la plaignante, toutes les personnes pr\u00e9sentes buvaient de l'alcool, sauf elle. Elle a soutenu qu'\u00e0 un moment, Carol LaBillois-Slocum l'a forc\u00e9e \u00e0 prendre un verre et lui a m\u00eame donn\u00e9 une gifle en lui disant de se d\u00e9gourdir. Carol LaBillois-Slocum \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'audience lorsque la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Elle faisait aussi partie de la liste de t\u00e9moins des intim\u00e9s, mais elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[15] \u00c0 un moment pendant la soir\u00e9e, alors que la plaignante pla\u00e7ait des homards dans la chambre froide, Barry LaBillois a ferm\u00e9 la porte de la chambre et l'a enferm\u00e9e \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur. La plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle a paniqu\u00e9 et qu'elle s'est mise \u00e0 frapper la porte et \u00e0 crier pour que quelqu'un la laisse sortir. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si quelqu'un d'autre se trouvait dans la chambre avec elle, elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne s'en souvenait pas. D'apr\u00e8s ses souvenirs, cet [traduction] incident aurait dur\u00e9 [traduction] quelques minutes. Barry LaBillois a finalement ouvert la porte et l'a laiss\u00e9e sortir. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'il riait. La plaignante ne lui a rien dit et elle est retourn\u00e9e dans la maison.\n[16] En contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. LaBillois avait agi de cette fa\u00e7on parce qu'elle \u00e9tait mal\u00e9cite et que cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement \u00e9tait pr\u00e9curseur de ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 plus tard dans la soir\u00e9e. Barry LaBillois a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce n'\u00e9tait qu'une blague et que la plaignante n'\u00e9tait pas seule dans la chambre froide, mais que Jason Harquail s'y trouvait aussi. Il a soutenu que, lorsque la porte a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte, la plaignante et Jason Harquail [traduction] avaient bien ri . Lorsqu'on lui a pos\u00e9 la question, Jason Harquail a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne se souvenait pas d'un quelconque \u00e9v\u00e9nement pendant cette soir\u00e9e et il n'a jamais mentionn\u00e9 l'incident de la chambre froide.\n[17] La plaignante a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 un moment pendant la soir\u00e9e, Barry LaBillois a affirm\u00e9 que les Mal\u00e9cites \u00e9taient [traduction] une race inf\u00e9rieure et qu'ils \u00e9taient [traduction] lents et parl[aient] lentement. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lui avoir dit qu'il ne devrait pas dire des choses pareilles et il lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il disait la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Cependant, en contre-interrogatoire, elle a reconnu que c'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu'elle mentionnait que Barry LaBillois avait r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 son commentaire et que, puisque la suppos\u00e9e r\u00e9ponse de M. LaBillois, selon laquelle il disait la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite dans sa plainte, il \u00e9tait possible qu'il ne l'ait jamais dite.\n[18] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 s'il avait fait ces commentaires, Barry LaBillois a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] J'affirme que ce n'est jamais arriv\u00e9. Je n'ai fait aucun commentaire au sujet des Mal\u00e9cites pendant cette soir\u00e9e.\n[19] La plaignante n'a jamais rapport\u00e9 ces incidents au NBAPC. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait peur de perdre son emploi en raison du poste de Barry LaBillois au sein du NBAPC.\nB. Incidents en milieu de travail [20] La plaignante a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que plusieurs incidents avaient eu lieu dans son milieu de travail. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 plusieurs reprises, Barry LaBillois est sorti de son bureau pour lui dire qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que les Mal\u00e9cites \u00e9taient inf\u00e9rieurs parce qu'il l'avait lu sur Internet. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 des d\u00e9tails au sujet de ces incidents, elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que ce n'\u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 qu'une seule fois, en 2002 (elle n'a pas pu donner plus de pr\u00e9cisions), apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut obtenu le poste de monitrice des p\u00eaches autochtones.\n[21] La plaignante a aussi mentionn\u00e9 un incident qui a eu lieu alors que Phillip Fraser \u00e9tait superviseur. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Barry LaBillois avait fait une remarque au sujet des Mal\u00e9cites devant M. Fraser. Elle n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 quelle \u00e9tait cette remarque. En contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante a reconnu que cette question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue.\n[22] Toujours en contre-interrogatoire, elle a mentionn\u00e9 des remarques que Barry LaBillois avait faites dans lesquelles il d\u00e9crivait les Mal\u00e9cites comme \u00e9tant des gens qui parlaient lentement, qui \u00e9taient stupides et incapables de suivre des instructions. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que ces commentaires l'avaient rendue mal \u00e0 l'aise et que, lorsqu'elle lui disait comment elle se sentait, les choses ne faisaient qu'empirer. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il claquait les portes et qu'il la faisait travailler pendant son heure de repas. La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de pr\u00e9ciser \u00e0 quel moment ces incidents ont eu lieu et son t\u00e9moignage constitue la seule preuve \u00e0 l'appui de ces all\u00e9gations. Elle a reconnu n'avoir mentionn\u00e9 ces incidents \u00e0 son employeur qu'en juillet ou en ao\u00fbt 2002.\n[23] La plaignante a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la chef Lavallee l'avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 qualifi\u00e9e de Mal-i-Mic, ce qui d'apr\u00e8s elle constitue de la discrimination. La chef Lavallee a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle utilisait cette expression en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que la plaignante \u00e9tait d'origine mal\u00e9cite et micmaque. La chef Lavallee a aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le bulletin du NBAPC se nomme The Mal-i-Mic.\n[24] La plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 d'autres incidents au cours desquels Barry LaBillois lui lan\u00e7ait des objets - des gommes \u00e0 effacer, des stylos, des gobelets \u00e0 caf\u00e9 en styromousse - \u00e0 partir de son bureau pour attirer son attention. Elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il l'appelait Eleanor ou Magoo et qu'il ne l'appelait pas par son vrai nom. Toujours selon ses d\u00e9clarations, elle lui a dit vouloir qu'on l'appelle par son vrai nom, mais que cela n'avait fait aucune diff\u00e9rence. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'appr\u00e9ciait pas le fait qu'il l'appelle par ces noms. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 qu'elle ne l'avait jamais entendu donner des surnoms \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s. La plaignante a reconnu que le fait que Barry LaBillois l'appelait Eleanor ne constituait pas de la discrimination, mais a affirm\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait quand m\u00eame [traduction] humiliant. Je note que Monique Myrshrall, une coll\u00e8ge de la plaignante, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. LaBillois appelait tout le monde par des noms diff\u00e9rents et que Mme Myrshrall appelait aussi M. LaBillois Bartholomew.\n[25] Monique Myrshrall a rappel\u00e9 un autre incident qui a eu lieu dans une chambre d'h\u00f4tel \u00e0 Bathurst, au Nouveau-Brunswick. Elle n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la date de cet incident. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait entendu Barry LaBillois et Carol LaBillois-Slocum dire que la plaignante apprenait lentement et \u00e9tait stupide. Barry LaBillois a ni\u00e9 avoir fait ces commentaires, qu'il a attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 sa sur. Bien que ces commentaires soient humiliants et certainement tout \u00e0 fait inappropri\u00e9s de la part d'un superviseur, rien dans le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Myrshrall ne d\u00e9montre que les commentaires faisaient r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante.\n[26] Barry LaBillois a reconnu qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux Mal\u00e9cites comme \u00e9tant des [traduction] mangeurs de rats musqu\u00e9s. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait [traduction] bien connu le long de la rivi\u00e8re Saint John que les Mal\u00e9cites mangent des rats musqu\u00e9s. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il croyait que c'\u00e9tait dr\u00f4le et qu'il ne faisait que plaisanter lorsqu'il faisait de tels commentaires. Lorsque l'avocat de la plaignante lui a pos\u00e9 des questions plus pouss\u00e9es, il n'a jamais directement ni\u00e9 avoir fait d'autres commentaires, au sujet desquels on ne lui a demand\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9cision, ni en interrogatoire principal, ni en contre-interrogatoire. Il a ajout\u00e9 que les commentaires \u00e9taient faits de fa\u00e7on humoristique. Il a aussi ajout\u00e9 que la plaignante ne lui avait jamais dit qu'elle n'aimait pas ces commentaires.\nC. Le nettoyage du bureau [27] Vers le 31 mai 2002, tous les employ\u00e9s du NBAPC ont re\u00e7u la consigne de participer au nettoyage du bureau. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'alors qu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur en train d'attacher des morceaux de bois sur le plateau d'un camion, Barry LaBillois lui a dit [traduction] tu ne sais pas comment attacher des branches. Vous, les Mal\u00e9cites, vous ne semblez pas \u00eatre capables de faire grand-chose. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que ces commentaires lui ont donn\u00e9 le sentiment d'\u00eatre inutile. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si quelqu'un d'autre avait entendu ces commentaires, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Monique Myrshrall entrait dans l'immeuble au moment o\u00f9 Barry aurait prononc\u00e9 ces paroles, mais elle ne croit pas que Mme Myrshrall \u00e9tait assez proche pour les avoir entendues. Barry LaBillois a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne se souvenait [traduction] pas d'avoir fait des commentaires au sujet des Mal\u00e9cites ce jour-l\u00e0.\nD. Le test de personnalit\u00e9 [28] Vers la mi-avril 2002, Barry LaBillois est all\u00e9 \u00e0 Banff, en Alberta, pendant quelques jours pour suivre un cours de gestion. Pendant qu'il s'y trouvait, il a [traduction] trouv\u00e9 un questionnaire, qui d'apr\u00e8s lui \u00e9tait un [traduction] test de personnalit\u00e9.\n[29] En mai 2002, il a exig\u00e9 que tous les employ\u00e9s dont il \u00e9tait le superviseur remplissent le questionnaire. Lorsque les questionnaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplis, il les a examin\u00e9s et les a not\u00e9s en fonction des r\u00e9ponses qui \u00e9taient inscrites. D'apr\u00e8s la plaignante, apr\u00e8s un certain temps, Jason Harquail, Monique Myrshrall et elle-m\u00eame ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s par Barry LaBillois afin de discuter des r\u00e9sultats du test. La plaignante a soutenu que, devant ses coll\u00e8gues, Barry LaBillois lui a dit que ses r\u00e9sultats d\u00e9montraient qu'elle \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00e9trange et qu'elle n'avait [traduction] aucune colonne vert\u00e9brale. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que ces commentaires l'avaient rendue mal \u00e0 l'aise, mais qu'elle n'avait rien dit \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. D'apr\u00e8s elle, aucun autre employ\u00e9 n'a re\u00e7u d'\u00e9valuation d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 la suite de cet exercice. Ni le r\u00e9sultat du test ni le questionnaire n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve.\n[30] Monique Myrshrall, bien qu'elle se souvienne d'avoir rempli le questionnaire, ne se souvient pas de commentaires que Barry LaBillois aurait pu faire au sujet des r\u00e9sultats du test de la plaignante.\nE. Le d\u00e9placement des meubles [31] Le NBAPC a achet\u00e9 un bureau pour la plaignante. Barry LaBillois lui a dit de monter le meuble, ce qu'elle a fait. Par la suite, il lui a dit qu'elle avait probablement oubli\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait gauch\u00e8re et que le bureau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mont\u00e9 \u00e0 l'envers. Il lui a dit d'apporter les ajustements n\u00e9cessaires.\n[32] Barry LaBillois a aussi dit \u00e0 la plaignante de placer le bureau face au mur du fond, ce qui voulait dire que la plaignante aurait le dos tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle ne se sentait pas en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans cette position parce que, parfois, des clients entraient et \u00e9taient [traduction] un peu boulevers\u00e9s et qu'elle pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait leur faire face, plut\u00f4t que leur tourner le dos. Sans demander le consentement de M. LaBillois, la plaignante et Monique Myrshrall ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9arranger l'orientation du bureau. Elles ont tourn\u00e9 le bureau afin qu'il soit face \u00e0 la porte et non au mur du fond. Elles \u00e9taient d'avis que cet arrangement fonctionnait mieux et paraissait plus professionnel.\n[33] Lorsque Barry LaBillois est retourn\u00e9 au bureau, il a examin\u00e9 le nouvel arrangement et a [traduction] cri\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de le rejoindre dans son bureau. D'apr\u00e8s la plaignante, il lui aurait alors dit : [traduction] Mais qu'est-ce que tu penses que tu fais? Je veux que le bureau soit replac\u00e9 comme je t'ai dit de le faire. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait tent\u00e9 de lui expliquer pourquoi les changements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s, mais il ne voulait rien entendre. M. LaBillois a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais approuv\u00e9 ces changements.\n[34] La chef Lavallee a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de cet incident. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle savait que les meubles du bureau avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9s, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'on avait dit aux employ\u00e9s de ne pas le faire. Le [traduction] chef d'op\u00e9ration l'avait aussi avis\u00e9e que l'un des bureaux avait \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9. La chef Lavallee a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Barry LaBillois de se pr\u00e9senter dans son bureau et elle lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu'il allait faire \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle l'a avis\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait le superviseur et que, s'il donnait des ordres \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s, et que ses employ\u00e9s ne lui [traduction] ob\u00e9issaient pas, alors il devait reprendre le contr\u00f4le de la situation.\nF. La [traduction] derni\u00e8re confrontation [35] Comme les fonds destin\u00e9s au Programme de surveillance des p\u00eaches autochtones se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s, tous les employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied le 3 juillet 2002.\n[36] On a rappel\u00e9 la plaignante au travail le 15 juillet 2002, lorsque des nouveaux fonds ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Barry LaBillois \u00e9tait venu chez elle pour l'aviser qu'elle serait rappel\u00e9e au travail. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses pour ce que sa sur lui [traduction] avait fait. D'apr\u00e8s la plaignante, il parlait d'un incident qui avait eu lieu dans la salle de conf\u00e9rence en juin 2002. La plaignante \u00e9tait en train de d\u00eener dans cette pi\u00e8ce avec [traduction] quatre ou cinq personnes lorsque Carol LaBillois-Slocum est entr\u00e9e. Lorsqu'elle a vu la plaignante, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [traduction] avertissez-moi quand Evelyn aura quitt\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce parce que je viens de perdre l'app\u00e9tit. Barry LaBillois n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent lorsqu'elle a fait ces commentaires.\n[37] Barry LaBillois a confirm\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait organis\u00e9 pour se rendre \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de la plaignante. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que la plaignante et son mari avaient une voiture \u00e0 vendre et qu'il souhaitait aller l'examiner. Pendant cette visite, il a avis\u00e9 la plaignante que le financement du programme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tabli et qu'elle serait rappel\u00e9e au travail. \u00c0 l'audience, on n'a pos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. LaBillois aucune question \u00e0 propos du pr\u00e9tendu incident qui aurait eu lieu entre sa sur et la plaignante et il n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[38] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9\u00e7ue lorsqu'elle a su qu'elle allait \u00eatre rappel\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle ne souhaitait pas retourner travailler au NBAPC en raison de la fa\u00e7on dont elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e. Cependant, elle est tout de m\u00eame retourn\u00e9e.\n[39] La derni\u00e8re confrontation entre la plaignante et son superviseur a eu lieu le 17 juillet 2002. Ce jour-l\u00e0, Barry LaBillois a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de communiquer avec les p\u00eacheurs du NBAPC pour les aviser d'une ordonnance de d\u00e9rogation du minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait parcouru la liste des p\u00eacheurs, mais qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de communiquer avec eux. Elle s'est alors rendue au bureau de Barry LaBillois et lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable de joindre les p\u00eacheurs. D'apr\u00e8s elle, Barry LaBillois s'est f\u00e2ch\u00e9, il a us\u00e9 de langage grossier envers elle et il lui a dit de retourner travailler et de faire ce qu'on lui avait demand\u00e9. Il lui a ensuite dit de sortir du [traduction] foutu bureau.\n[40] Dans une lettre de plainte qu'elle a \u00e9crite \u00e0 la chef Lavallee le 23 ao\u00fbt 2002, la plaignante a apport\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions au sujet de la conversation qu'elle a eue avec son superviseur ce jour-l\u00e0. Elle a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction]\nJe me suis rendue au bureau de Barry apr\u00e8s le d\u00eener pour l'aviser du r\u00e9sultat des appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques [...] Il m'a interrompue et m'a dit ce qu'il voulait que je fasse. J'ai \u00e0 nouveau essay\u00e9 de lui expliquer le r\u00e9sultat de ce qu'il m'avait demand\u00e9 et il m'a encore interrompue. Il a continu\u00e9 de m'expliquer ce qu'il voulait que je fasse. Je lui ai dit : Je sais ce que vous voulez que je fasse, je veux seulement vous dire ce qui se passe. J'ai finalement trouv\u00e9 le courage de lui demander s'il avait un probl\u00e8me \u00e0 mon sujet. Barry m'a dit : Assieds-toi et si tu ne veux pas entendre ce que j'ai \u00e0 dire, sors de mon foutu bureau. J'ai r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il semblait qu'il avait clairement un probl\u00e8me \u00e0 mon sujet et que je voulais savoir ce que c'\u00e9tait (j'ai ferm\u00e9 la porte pour que la conversation reste priv\u00e9e). Il m'a r\u00e9pondu : Il y a beaucoup de choses. Il a ensuite dit que je d\u00e9fiais toujours son autorit\u00e9 en d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant mon bureau. Je lui ai dit que ce n'\u00e9tait pas mon id\u00e9e. Il a r\u00e9pondu : Je t'ai dit comment je voulais que tu places le bureau. Je lui ai r\u00e9pondu que \u00e7a avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 il y a longtemps. Il a dit : Et tes conversations avec Betty Ann. Je lui ai r\u00e9pondu : Je lui parle \u00e0 peine, veux-tu que je m'assoies dans le salon des fumeurs et que je ne lui dise rien les matins o\u00f9 il n'y a qu'elle et moi? Nous sommes ensuite revenus sur le sujet de la confrontation. Il a commenc\u00e9 par dire que, si je voulais poser des questions, tout le monde avait la possibilit\u00e9 de poser des questions \u00e0 la fin des r\u00e9unions de service. Je lui ai dit : Comment est-ce que je saurai ce que vous voulez que je fasse si je ne peux pas poser des questions \u00e0 ce sujet? Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se calmer et m'a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contrari\u00e9. Il m'a ensuite parl\u00e9 d'une fa\u00e7on plus calme. L'engueulade \u00e9tait termin\u00e9e. J'ai eu les r\u00e9ponses que je cherchais et je suis retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 mon bureau.\n[41] La chef Lavallee confirme dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le matin du 17 juillet 2002, elle a donn\u00e9 comme instruction \u00e0 Barry LaBillois de communiquer avec les p\u00eacheurs du NBAPC pour leur dire de regagner la terre. Elle d\u00e9clare que, ce m\u00eame matin, alors qu'elle fumait une cigarette, elle a entendu la plaignante et Monique Myrshrall discuter dans le salon des fumeurs. D'apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, elles faisaient des remarques m\u00e9prisantes au sujet de Barry LaBillois. Elles disaient qu'il ne savait pas ce qu'il faisait et qu'elles ne devraient pas avoir \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 chacun des p\u00eacheurs. La chef Lavallee a appel\u00e9 Barry LaBillois \u00e0 son bureau et lui a dit qu'il devait [traduction] reprendre le contr\u00f4le de ses employ\u00e9s. Elle lui a dit qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas [traduction] impressionn\u00e9e par la conduite de ses employ\u00e9s et qu'il ne se comportait pas comme un superviseur le devait.\n[42] D'apr\u00e8s Barry LaBillois, apr\u00e8s sa rencontre avec la chef Lavallee, il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son bureau. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il a alors demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de venir dans son bureau et lui a dit qu'elle devait communiquer avec chacun des p\u00eacheurs. La plaignante lui a dit qu'elle avait essay\u00e9, mais qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable de joindre certains d'entre eux. M. LaBillois a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il lui a dit de continuer d'essayer parce qu'il \u00e9tait important que les p\u00eacheurs soient avis\u00e9s de la situation ce jour-l\u00e0. Ils ont continu\u00e9 cet \u00e9change jusqu'\u00e0 ce que Barry LaBillois perde patience : [traduction] J'en ai eu assez, j'ai perdu les p\u00e9dales et je lui ai dit de sortir de mon foutu bureau. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'avait eu aucune autre interaction avec la plaignante apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut quitt\u00e9 son bureau.\n[43] \u00c0 l'audience, la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu'elle a quitt\u00e9 le bureau de M. LaBillois, elle n'est pas retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 son bureau, mais elle s'est rendue \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage sup\u00e9rieur pour discuter avec la chef Lavallee. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu'elle d\u00e9cidait de parler \u00e0 la chef Lavallee des incidents concernant son superviseur. Lorsqu'elle est arriv\u00e9e, la chef Lavallee \u00e9tait au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau apr\u00e8s le d\u00eener. \u00c0 l'audience, la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le tout avait eu lieu le matin et que sa premi\u00e8re tentative de discuter avec la chef Lavallee avait aussi eu lieu \u00e0 la fin de l'avant-midi. Cependant, je note que dans sa lettre du 23 ao\u00fbt, elle d\u00e9clare : [traduction] \u00c0 ma deuxi\u00e8me journ\u00e9e de travail, Barry [LaBillois] et moi avons eu notre derni\u00e8re confrontation apr\u00e8s le d\u00eener. J'avais un rendez-vous pr\u00e9vu avec la chef apr\u00e8s le d\u00eener, elle devait me laisser savoir \u00e0 quel moment elle \u00e9tait libre parce qu'elle r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 des questions (au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone) ce midi-l\u00e0, mais avant mon rendez-vous, mon superviseur et moi avons eu une confrontation. Ce dernier incident m'a pouss\u00e9e \u00e0 aborder la question avec la chef Betty Ann [Lavallee]. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[44] Ses souvenirs de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement, tels qu'elle les d\u00e9crits dans sa lettre, sont quelque peu diff\u00e9rents de ceux qu'elle a d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l'audience. Premi\u00e8rement, elle pr\u00e9cise dans sa lettre que la confrontation avec son superviseur a eue lieu apr\u00e8s le d\u00eener, alors qu'elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience qu'elle avait eue lieu avant le d\u00eener. En contre-interrogatoire, elle a reconnu qu'elle aurait d\u00fb \u00e9crire [traduction] avant le d\u00eener. Cette contradiction n'est pas tr\u00e8s importante, mais d'autres incoh\u00e9rences le sont. Par exemple, dans la lettre, elle mentionne un [traduction] rendez-vous pr\u00e9vu avec la chef Lavallee. Dans sa lettre, elle a aussi \u00e9crit : [traduction] J'ai mentionn\u00e9 de vive voix \u00e0 la chef Betty Ann Lavallee le comportement de Barry bien que ce n'\u00e9tait pas ma justification pour prendre le rendez-vous avec elle. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[45] \u00c0 l'audience, la plaignante n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 de [traduction] rendez-vous pr\u00e9vu, ce qui donne l'impression que sa rencontre avec la chef \u00e9tait spontan\u00e9e et qu'elle \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat de l'incident qui venait d'avoir lieu avec son superviseur. Comme la lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite environ un mois apr\u00e8s les \u00e9v\u00e9nements, je conclus qu'elle est plus convaincante et cr\u00e9dible que le t\u00e9moignage entendu \u00e0 l'audience.\n[46] La plaignante a finalement rencontr\u00e9 la chef Lavallee apr\u00e8s le d\u00eener. En interrogatoire principal, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la chef Lavallee de l'attitude de Barry LaBillois envers elle. De fa\u00e7on plus pr\u00e9cise, elle a dit qu'elle avait avis\u00e9 la chef Lavallee du fait que Barry LaBillois avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les Mal\u00e9cites \u00e9taient inf\u00e9rieurs. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait tent\u00e9 d'expliquer les autres incidents, mais qu'elle avait fondu en larmes. Lorsqu'elle a vu que la plaignante \u00e9tait contrari\u00e9e, la chef Lavallee lui a dit de retourner chez elle pour le reste de la semaine et de se reposer. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la chef Lavallee lui a dit qu'elle communiquerait avec Barry LaBillois pour voir ce qui se passait bien que, d'apr\u00e8s la plaignante, la chef Lavallee n'ait jamais sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 la tenue d'une rencontre entre elle, la chef et Barry LaBillois. La plaignante a ajout\u00e9 que si on lui avait propos\u00e9 une telle rencontre, elle aurait imm\u00e9diatement accept\u00e9.\n[47] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa discussion avec la chef Lavallee, la plaignante a \u00e9crit dans sa lettre : [traduction] Quand je me suis pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 son bureau, j'\u00e9tais contrari\u00e9e par la confrontation avec Barry [...] Betty Ann m'a demand\u00e9 ce qu'il y avait. J'ai commenc\u00e9 par lui demander si l'offre de me mettre \u00e0 pied \u00e9tait toujours bonne. J'ai fondu en larmes \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 et j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de dire quoi que ce soit. J'ai dit \u00e0 Betty Ann que je trouvais que Barry n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s professionnel et que je n'avais jamais eu \u00e0 travailler avec quelqu'un comme lui auparavant. Il n'\u00e9tait pas comme \u00e7a au d\u00e9but. Il faisait des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes \u00e0 mon sujet parce que je suis Mal\u00e9cite. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, nous pr\u00e9parions les homards pour les distribuer dans la province. J'ai dit \u00e0 Barry que ses remarques m'insultaient et qu'il n'insultait pas seulement moi, mais aussi toute ma famille. Je pensais que ce serait tout, mais \u00e7a ne s'est pas arr\u00eat\u00e9 l\u00e0. [...] J'ai demand\u00e9 si l'offre d'\u00eatre mise \u00e0 pied \u00e9tait toujours bonne. C'est la raison pour laquelle je voulais la rencontrer. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[48] D'apr\u00e8s la chef Lavallee, la plaignante n'avait pas l'air boulevers\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de la r\u00e9union. Elle se souvient que la plaignante se soit assise et lui a demand\u00e9 si elle pouvait accepter l'offre d'une mise \u00e0 pied anticip\u00e9e. Lorsqu'elle lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi, la chef Lavallee a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plaignante [traduction] a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer quelque chose au sujet de Barry. La chef Lavallee lui a alors dit qu'elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. LaBillois de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner aux p\u00eacheurs pour leur faire regagner la terre. \u00c0 ce moment, la plaignante s'est mise \u00e0 pleurer. La chef Lavallee a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle a alors demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante si elle pouvait faire venir Barry LaBillois et la plaignante a refus\u00e9. La chef Lavallee a ajout\u00e9 que chaque fois qu'elle a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'elles se r\u00e9unissent avec Barry LaBillois pour discuter de l'affaire, la plaignante a refus\u00e9. Cela contredit la preuve de la plaignante, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que si on lui avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 une rencontre avec Barry LaBillois et la chef, elle aurait accept\u00e9.\n[49] Lorsqu'elle a vu que la plaignante \u00e9tait boulevers\u00e9e, la chef Lavallee lui a dit qu'il vaudrait mieux qu'elle retourne \u00e0 la maison et qu'elle prenne le reste de la semaine de cong\u00e9. La chef lui a dit qu'elle discuterait avec Barry LaBillois et qu'au cours des semaines \u00e0 venir, ils allaient se r\u00e9unir et r\u00e9gler la situation.\n[50] Plus tard dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi du 17 juillet, la chef Lavallee a inform\u00e9 Barry LaBillois de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9.\n[51] La plaignante soutient que le 22 juillet 2002, elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la chef Lavallee pour savoir ce qui se passait. La chef Lavallee lui a alors dit qu'elle n'avait pas encore discut\u00e9 avec Barry LaBillois. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle a alors dit \u00e0 la chef Lavallee qu'elle ne se sentait pas \u00e0 l'aise \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e de retourner au travail jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les probl\u00e8mes avec son superviseur soient r\u00e9gl\u00e9s. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, la chef Lavallee lui aurait dit qu'elle pr\u00e9parerait son relev\u00e9 d'emploi, sur lequel elle indiquerait que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 pied en raison d'un manque de financement.\n[52] La chef Lavallee a des souvenirs l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rents de ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 le lundi 22 juillet. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que la plaignante devait lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner, mais elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne l'avait jamais fait. La chef Lavallee a d'abord t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante le mercredi 24 juillet 2002, mais un peu plus tard elle a reconnu que c'\u00e9tait la plaignante qui lui avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0. La chef Lavallee soutient que, pendant cette conversation, la plaignante lui a dit \u00e0 nouveau qu'elle ne voulait pas parler \u00e0 Barry LaBillois. La plaignante lui aurait encore demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre mise \u00e0 pied. La chef Lavallee a fait pr\u00e9parer le relev\u00e9 d'emploi de la plaignante. La raison indiqu\u00e9e pour la mise \u00e0 pied \u00e9tait : [traduction] Entente avec le MPO au sujet des p\u00eaches autochtones n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e, par cons\u00e9quent, aucun financement pour le programme.\n[53] Le 23 ao\u00fbt 2002, la plaignante a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 la chef Lavallee. Dans cette lettre, elle mentionne qu'elle a quitt\u00e9 son emploi en raison d'un [traduction] environnement de travail hostile, dans lequel elle avait fait l'objet de [traduction] remarques discriminatoires et d\u00e9sobligeantes de la part de son superviseur. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 en particulier des incidents au cours desquels M. LaBillois aurait dit : [traduction] les Mal\u00e9cites sont comme \u00e7a, les Mal\u00e9cites sont inf\u00e9rieurs, seule une Mal\u00e9cite ferait \u00e7a. Elle a aussi mentionn\u00e9 le fait qu'il lan\u00e7ait des objets et qu'il l'appelait par le surnom Eleanor. La plaignante a aussi mentionn\u00e9 l'incident au sujet du r\u00e9arrangement du bureau ainsi que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 la [traduction] derni\u00e8re confrontation.\n[54] La chef Lavallee a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la lettre de la plaignante du 23 ao\u00fbt 2002 \u00e9tait son premier contact avec cette derni\u00e8re depuis juillet 2002. Lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u la lettre, la chef Lavallee a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Barry LaBillois de la rejoindre dans son bureau pour l'aviser qu'elle avait re\u00e7u une plainte. Elle a discut\u00e9 avec Barry LaBillois du contenu de la lettre. Elle lui a dit qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas impressionn\u00e9e par la situation et que, s'il avait fait son travail correctement, la situation n'aurait pas d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9. Elle lui a aussi dit que c'est la raison pour laquelle les superviseurs doivent \u00eatre fermes avec les employ\u00e9s et qu'ils doivent s'assurer que les employ\u00e9s respectent les r\u00e8gles et les proc\u00e9dures.\n[55] Le 26 ao\u00fbt 2002, Barry LaBillois a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 la chef Lavallee en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre de la plaignante. Dans cette lettre, il pr\u00e9tend r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toutes les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante. En ce qui a trait aux commentaires qu'il aurait cens\u00e9ment faits lors de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement de distribution de homards, il ne nie pas les avoir faits. Ce qu'il explique dans sa lettre, c'est que : [traduction] Mme London n'a jamais dit qu'elle avait un probl\u00e8me avec cela. Si Mme London avait un probl\u00e8me avec ce que j'ai dit, c'est la premi\u00e8re fois que j'en entends parler. Au sein des groupes autochtones dans tout le pays, il est de pratique commune de plaisanter entre nous au sujet de quelle tribu est sup\u00e9rieure. Lorsque le sujet a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re fois, Mme London aurait d\u00fb [profiter] de l'occasion pour dire quelque chose \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, [mais] elle ne l'a fait qu'un an plus tard. Je ne peux que m'excuser de ce manque de tact de ma part. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas mon [intention] de l'insulter ou d'insulter sa famille.\n[56] Le 10 septembre 2002, la chef Lavallee a envoy\u00e9 une lettre disciplinaire \u00e0 Barry LaBillois. Dans cette lettre, elle \u00e9crit : [traduction] Comme nous en avons discut\u00e9 lors de la r\u00e9union du 10 septembre 2002, vers 11 h, je vous ai dit que je vous enverrais une lettre de r\u00e9primande parce que vous avez utilis\u00e9 un langage grossier envers Mme London. Aussi, nous avons discut\u00e9 du fait que vous ne devez pas appeler les employ\u00e9s par un autre nom que le leur, qu'il ne faut pas lancer d'objet dans le bureau ou vers quelqu'un, peu importe que ce soit \u00e0 titre de plaisanterie, et finalement, vous ne devez pas plaisanter avec les employ\u00e9s au sujet de leurs affiliations tribales. \u00c0 l'audience, elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle le r\u00e9primandait pour avoir utilis\u00e9 un langage grossier parce qu'il avait reconnu qu'il avait utilis\u00e9 des termes grossiers et qu'il criait. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait reconnu avoir fait des blagues au sujet de l'origine mal\u00e9cite de la plaignante, qu'il avait lanc\u00e9 des choses dans le bureau et qu'il l'appelait Eleanor. Dans sa lettre, elle ajoute :\n[traduction]\nVous avez reconnu vos actions, vous en avez assum\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 et vous m'avez assur\u00e9e que ce type de comportement ne se reproduirait pas [...] M. LaBillois, la vice-chef adjointe, Barbara Cameron, et moi sommes toutes les deux tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9es et d\u00e9\u00e7ues de votre comportement. Soyez avis\u00e9s que si ce type d'attitude ou de comportement offensif se reproduit \u00e0 l'avenir avec n'importe quel employ\u00e9 du New Brunswick Aboriginal Peoples Council, l'ex\u00e9cutif du NBAPC n'aura d'autre choix que de prendre des mesures plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res.\nLa plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait jamais vu cette lettre avant la pr\u00e9sente audience. La chef Lavallee a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle ne croyait pas n\u00e9cessaire d'aviser la plaignante de l'existence de cette r\u00e9primande, puisqu'elle croyait que cela aurait constitu\u00e9 un manquement \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9.\n[57] La chef Lavallee a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas convaincue que les actions de Barry LaBillois visaient \u00e0 blesser la plaignante, mais elle voulait que cette r\u00e9primande [traduction] fixe la barre haute pour l'avenir.\n[58] Le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2002, la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission des droits de la personne du Nouveau-Brunswick, croyant que l'organisme avait comp\u00e9tence en l'esp\u00e8ce. La plainte a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne le 30 mai 2005.\n[59] Le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2003, la plaignante a re\u00e7u une lettre de la chef Lavallee l'avisant que le Programme des p\u00eaches autochtones avait re\u00e7u des fonds et qu'elle pouvait reprendre son poste de monitrice des p\u00eaches autochtones en date du 10 mars 2003. La lettre l'avisait aussi que l'entente de financement n'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue que jusqu'\u00e0 la fin mars 2003. Le 6 mars 2003, la plaignante a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la chef Lavallee pour l'aviser qu'elle n'acceptait pas l'offre parce que [traduction] les probl\u00e8mes avec Barry LaBillois [n'avaient] toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9s.\n[60] Le 7 mars 2003, la chef Lavallee a r\u00e9pondu par \u00e9crit \u00e0 la plaignante pour l'aviser que le NBAPC avait pris des mesures pour examiner sa plainte et qu'il avait [traduction] mis en place les mesures disciplinaires n\u00e9cessaires. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le NBAPC avait aussi [traduction] r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 [sa] politique selon laquelle aucune blague, conversation ou remarque de nature personnelle n'est accept\u00e9e dans le bureau. Je suis convaincue que si vous revenez au travail au NBAPC, vous ne serez pas victime de probl\u00e8mes ou de manquements aux droits de la personne. La chef Lavallee a aussi \u00e9crit qu'une partie des probl\u00e8mes que la plaignante avait d\u00e9crits comme \u00e9tant [traduction] un environnement de travail hostile \u00e9tait en fait un probl\u00e8me de [traduction] communication interpersonnelle au bureau. Elle a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] Je peux seulement r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ma demande que tous les employ\u00e9s agissent entre eux avec respect en tout temps. Elle a termin\u00e9 sa lettre en r\u00e9p\u00e9tant l'offre d'emploi, mais elle a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] Si mes pr\u00e9cisions ne vous satisfont pas, et si vous choisissez de ne pas reprendre votre emploi, alors je n'aurai d'autre choix que de consid\u00e9rer que vous avez donn\u00e9 votre d\u00e9mission finale du NBAPC. Si c'est le cas, je pr\u00e9parerai un relev\u00e9 d'emploi qui refl\u00e8te votre d\u00e9cision de quitter votre poste.\n[61] La plaignante soutient que cette offre d'emploi constituait des repr\u00e9sailles parce qu'elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes. La chef Lavallee r\u00e9pond que l'offre d'emploi n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, mais qu'elle portait sur le fait qu'une entente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue avec le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans au sujet du financement et que tous les employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient rappel\u00e9s au travail. Je note que la plaignante n'a jamais soulev\u00e9 de question portant sur des repr\u00e9sailles dans sa plainte.\n[62] La plaignante n'est jamais retourn\u00e9e travailler pour le NBAPC.\nIII. LES DISPOSITIONS L\u00c9GALES [63] La plaignante soutient que les intim\u00e9s ont agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle au sens des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi. L'article 7 pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi. L'alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Les motifs de distinction illicite comprennent la race et l'origine nationale ou ethnique. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante soutient que les intim\u00e9s ont agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle en raison de son origine mal\u00e9cite. La question de savoir si l'origine mal\u00e9cite de la plaignante constitue une origine nationale ou ethnique au sens de l'article 3 de la Loi n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s.\n[64] Comme l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle le NBAPC a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers la plaignante en cours d'emploi d\u00e9coule uniquement de sa plainte en vertu de l'article 14, je trancherai la question de l'article 14 en premier et, si c'est n\u00e9cessaire, je traiterai ensuite les all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 7.\n[65] Le harc\u00e8lement interdit par la Loi peut prendre plusieurs formes. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante soutient qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e en raison de sa race et de son origine nationale ou ethnique. La jurisprudence a \u00e9tabli que pour que la plainte soit justifi\u00e9e, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le harc\u00e8lement soit le seul motif derri\u00e8re le comportement en question et le harc\u00e8lement ne doit pas obligatoirement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 intentionnel de la part du contrevenant. (Voir les d\u00e9cisions Swan c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) (1994), 25 C.H.R.R.D.\/312, au paragraphe 73 (T.C.D.P.), annul\u00e9e pour d'autres motifs (1995), 25 C.H.R.R.D.\/333 (C.F. 1re inst.); Dhanjal c. Air Canada (1996), C.H.R.R. D\/27, au paragraphe 206 (T.C.D.P.), conf. par [1997] A.C.F. no 1599 (C.F. 1re inst.) (Q.L.); Marinaki c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines), [2000] D.C.D.P. no 2, au paragraphe 187 (T.C.D.P.) (Q.L.); Rampersadsingh c. Wignall, [2002] D.C.D.P. no 27, au paragraphe 40).\n[66] Dans l'affaire Canada (CDP) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) et Franke, [1999] 3 C.F. 653, aux paragraphes 29 \u00e0 50 (C.F. 1re inst.) (Franke) (aussi appliqu\u00e9 dans les cas de harc\u00e8lement racial, voir Rampersadsing, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e; Morin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 41, au paragraphe 246), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pour qu'une plainte de harc\u00e8lement soit fond\u00e9e, il faut d\u00e9montrer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\nLes gestes qui sont vis\u00e9s par la plainte sont importuns, ce que l'on peut d\u00e9terminer en \u00e9valuant la r\u00e9action de la plaignante au moment o\u00f9 les incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de harc\u00e8lement se produisent ou si celle-ci a montr\u00e9, que ce soit de vive voix ou par son comportement, que la conduite \u00e9tait importune. La norme applicable pour pouvoir \u00e9valuer la conduite de la plaignante est celle d'une personne raisonnable dans les circonstances. Dans les cas o\u00f9 la plaignante all\u00e8gue qu'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement du fait de son origine nationale ou ethnique, il faut montrer que la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 est li\u00e9e \u00e0 ce motif. Le harc\u00e8lement peut \u00eatre de nature verbale, comprenant un comportement caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 par des insultes ou des observations concernant l'origine nationale ou ethnique d'une personne. Le Tribunal doit \u00e9tablir si la conduite importune \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'origine de la plaignante en examinant ce qu'une personne raisonnable trouverait normal dans les circonstances entourant le cas, compte tenu des normes sociales courantes. (Rampersadsingh, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 41.) Ordinairement, pour qu'il y ait harc\u00e8lement, il faut que celui-ci soit persistant ou r\u00e9p\u00e9titif mais, dans certaines circonstances, m\u00eame un seul incident peut \u00eatre suffisamment grave pour cr\u00e9er un environnement hostile. Dans l'affaire Franke, par exemple, le Tribunal a fait observer qu'une agression physique peut \u00eatre suffisamment grave pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Par contre, une plaisanterie obsc\u00e8ne, bien que de mauvais go\u00fbt, ne suffirait pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement sexuel et pour cr\u00e9er un environnement de travail d\u00e9favorable. Le crit\u00e8re objectif de la personne raisonnable est \u00e9galement employ\u00e9 pour \u00e9valuer ce facteur. Le dernier facteur se rapporte au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte \u00e0 l'endroit de l'employeur relativement \u00e0 la conduite de l'un des employ\u00e9s. Selon les principes d'\u00e9quit\u00e9, dans des situations pareilles, la victime de harc\u00e8lement doit, dans la mesure du possible, aviser l'employeur de la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\nIV. ANALYSE DES FAITS [67] Les d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne pr\u00e9voient que le premier fardeau incombe au plaignant, qui doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Lorsque la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, l'intim\u00e9 a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le fardeau d'expliquer. (Hill c. Air Canada, [2003] D.C.D.P. no 3.)\n[68] Je conclus que, m\u00eame si je devais accepter que les faits en l'esp\u00e8ce correspondent aux preuves pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l'appui de la plainte, le comportement des intim\u00e9s ne constitue pas du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur les motifs de la race et de l'origine nationale ou ethnique, au sens de la Loi. Je suis convaincu que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 indispos\u00e9e et d\u00e9rang\u00e9e par le comportement de Barry LaBillois, mais ce comportement ne correspond pas aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la Loi en ce qui a trait aux formes interdites de harc\u00e8lement.\n[69] Afin d'expliquer cette conclusion, j'appliquerai maintenant les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans l'affaire Franke \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nA. Le comportement contest\u00e9 \u00e9tait-il li\u00e9 \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante? [70] Je me pencherai sur chacune des situations au cours desquelles, selon la plaignante, Barry LaBillois ou le NBAPC l'ont harcel\u00e9e en raison du fait qu'elle est Mal\u00e9cite.\n(i) L'incident de la distribution de homards [71] Pendant cette soir\u00e9e en septembre 2001, la plaignante soutient que l'intim\u00e9 Barry LaBillois a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle en raison de son origine mal\u00e9cite. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 deux incidents : lorsqu'il l'a enferm\u00e9e dans la chambre froide et lorsqu'il lui a dit que les Mal\u00e9cites \u00e9taient une [traduction] race inf\u00e9rieure et qu'ils \u00e9taient [traduction] lents et parl[aient] lentement.\n[72] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'incident de la chambre froide, bien qu'il d\u00e9montre un manque de maturit\u00e9 de la part de M. LaBillois, je ne vois pas comment cet incident peut \u00eatre li\u00e9 \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l'origine ethnique ou nationale de la plaignante et je n'en tiendrai pas compte dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[73] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'autre incident, lorsque M. LaBillois aurait apparement dit que les Mal\u00e9cites \u00e9taient une [traduction] race inf\u00e9rieure et qu'ils \u00e9taient [traduction] lents et parl[aient] lentement, M. LaBillois a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais fait ces commentaires.\n[74] Tant la plaignante que Barry LaBillois ont reconnu que la sur de l'intim\u00e9, Carol LaBillois-Slocum, \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente lorsque ces commentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits. Mme LaBillois-Slocum faisait partie de la liste de t\u00e9moins des intim\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute. Tr\u00e8s tard dans la proc\u00e9dure, l'avocat des intim\u00e9s a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle ne serait pas appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. J'en d\u00e9duis que ce t\u00e9moin possible aurait confirm\u00e9 que ces commentaires ont bien \u00e9t\u00e9 faits. Je note aussi que dans sa lettre du 26 ao\u00fbt 2002, Barry LaBillois ne nie pas avoir fait ces commentaires. Il indique simplement que la plaignante, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, n'avait pas mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle avait un probl\u00e8me avec cela. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'accepte la preuve de la plaignante selon laquelle Barry LaBillois a bien fait ce soir-l\u00e0 les commentaires qu'on lui attribue.\n(ii) Les incidents en milieu de travail [75] Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des incidents qui auraient eu lieu en milieu de travail, au cours desquels elle soutient que l'intim\u00e9 Barry LaBillois a fait des commentaires au sujet des Mal\u00e9cites. Elle ne pouvait pas pr\u00e9ciser \u00e0 quel moment ces remarques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, ni ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit. Cependant, elle a mentionn\u00e9 un incident qui avait eu lieu devant son ancien superviseur, Phillip Fraser, mais elle a aussi admis que cette affaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e.\n[76] Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 du fait que Barry LaBillois avait d\u00e9crit les Mal\u00e9cites comme \u00e9tant des gens qui parlent lentement, qui sont stupides et qui sont incapables de suivre des instructions. Elle ne pouvait pas se souvenir des moments pr\u00e9cis au cours desquels ces remarques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, ni du contexte dans lequel elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 dites. Compte tenu du caract\u00e8re vague de ces all\u00e9gations, je comprends qu'il est plut\u00f4t difficile pour l'intim\u00e9 d'y r\u00e9pondre.\n[77] Monique Myrshrall a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet d'un incident qui a eu lieu dans une chambre d'h\u00f4tel \u00e0 Bathurst, lors duquel Barry LaBillois et sa sur auraient dit que la plaignante apprenait lentement et qu'elle \u00e9tait stupide. La plaignante n'a jamais mentionn\u00e9 cet incident dans sa plainte, ni dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'audience. Barry LaBillois a ni\u00e9 avoir fait ces commentaires, qu'il a attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 sa sur. Quoi qu'il en soit, aussi humiliants et inappropri\u00e9s que ces commentaires puissent \u00eatre, je n'y rel\u00e8ve rien qui fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante.\n[78] Barry LaBillois a seulement reconnu avoir fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux Mal\u00e9cites comme \u00e9tant des [traduction] mangeurs de rats musqu\u00e9s. La plaignante n'a jamais mentionn\u00e9 ce fait dans sa plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne vois pas comment ces commentaires peuvent faire partie de la plainte de la plaignante.\n[79] Finalement, je ne peux tirer aucune conclusion en mati\u00e8re de discrimination \u00e0 partir des incidents d\u00e9crits, comme le fait que M. LaBillois a lanc\u00e9 des objets dans le bureau et a appel\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s par d'autres noms que les leurs. Ces incidents peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s d'enfantins et d'immatures, de la part du superviseur, mais on ne m'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve me permettant d'\u00e9tablir qu'ils visaient \u00e0 faire preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[80] Dans une autre all\u00e9gation portant sur un commentaire que la chef Lavallee aurait fait, la plaignante soutient que la chef Lavallee a fait preuve de discrimination envers elle lorsqu'elle l'a appel\u00e9e Mal-i-Mic. La chef Lavallee a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle ne faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence qu'\u00e0 la double origine de la plaignante. Je note aussi que le bulletin du NBAPC s'appelle le Mal-i-Mic . Je ne vois aucune discrimination de la part de la chef Lavallee dans l'utilisation de cette expression.\n(iii) Le nettoyage du bureau [81] La plaignante soutient que Barry LaBillois a fait des remarques d\u00e9nigrantes au sujet des Mal\u00e9cites ce jour-l\u00e0. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il a vu qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas capable d'attacher certains morceaux de bois, il a dit : [traduction] Vous, les Mal\u00e9cites, vous ne semblez pas \u00eatre capables de faire grand chose. Barry LaBillois nie avoir fait de tels commentaires. Personne n'a entendu cet \u00e9change. Aux fins de la discussion, j'accepterai que ces commentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits.\n(iv) Le test de personnalit\u00e9 [82] La plaignante soutient que son superviseur a fait preuve de discrimination envers elle lorsque, apr\u00e8s lui avoir fait subir un test de personnalit\u00e9, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00e9trange et qu'elle n'avait [traduction] aucune colonne vert\u00e9brale. Elle soutient que ces commentaires peuvent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 de la discrimination de sa part. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que ces remarques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites devant ses coll\u00e8gues. Ni Monique Myshrall, un t\u00e9moin de la plaignante, ni Jason Harquail, un t\u00e9moin des intim\u00e9s, ne se souviennent de commentaires que Barry LaBillois aurait faits envers la plaignante au sujet de ses r\u00e9sultats.\n[83] Une fois de plus, je ne rel\u00e8ve rien dans ces remarques qui fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante. Il est clair qu'il existait des difficult\u00e9s interpersonnelles entre la plaignante et son superviseur, mais on ne peut pas interpr\u00e9ter la situation comme \u00e9tant discriminatoire.\n(v) Le d\u00e9placement des meubles [84] La preuve ne m'a pas convaincu que cet incident peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la race ou sur l'origine ethnique ou nationale.\n(vi) La [traduction] derni\u00e8re confrontation [85] J'ai examin\u00e9 toute la preuve de ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e et je ne rel\u00e8ve aucun commentaire de la part des intim\u00e9s au sujet de la race ou de l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante. Il y a eu beaucoup d'\u00e9changes du type J'ai dit \/ Il a dit, un certain langage grossier a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9, mais la preuve ne me convainc pas du fait que la situation \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e en partie sur la question de la race ou de l'origine nationale ou ethnique. Le niveau de stress dans le milieu de travail semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0 et les probl\u00e8mes interpersonnels entre la plaignante et son superviseur ont atteint leur niveau le plus haut. Voici ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 : un superviseur (LaBillois) a re\u00e7u l'ordre de son sup\u00e9rieur (Lavallee) d'ex\u00e9cuter une certaine t\u00e2che d'une certaine fa\u00e7on et une employ\u00e9e (la plaignante) a cru que ce n'\u00e9tait pas la bonne fa\u00e7on de g\u00e9rer la situation. Elle voulait discuter de la question avec son superviseur qui, \u00e0 un moment, a simplement perdu son sang-froid et a utilis\u00e9 un langage inappropri\u00e9, mais pas discriminatoire.\n[86] Je ne peux pas conclure que ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait li\u00e9 d'une quelconque fa\u00e7on \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante, au sens de la Loi.\n(vii) Conclusion [87] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je conclus que les seuls incidents qui peuvent \u00eatre li\u00e9s \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante sont les commentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits lors de la cuisson des homards, lorsque Barry LaBillois a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les Mal\u00e9cites \u00e9taient [traduction] inf\u00e9rieurs et qu'ils \u00e9taient [traduction] lents et parl[aient] lentement, ainsi que le commentaire qu'il a fait lors du nettoyage, lorsqu'il a dit : [traduction] Vous, les Mal\u00e9cites, vous ne semblez pas \u00eatre capables de faire grand chose.\nB. Le comportement contest\u00e9 \u00e9tait-il importun? [88] Il est difficile de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question compte tenu du fait que, selon la preuve, seulement deux ou trois incidents font clairement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un comportement qui pourrait \u00eatre discriminatoire et fond\u00e9 sur la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante. N\u00e9anmoins, je tiens \u00e0 trancher cette question. J'ai expliqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t qu'afin de d\u00e9terminer si le comportement des intim\u00e9s \u00e9tait importun, je devais examiner la r\u00e9action de la plaignante au moment des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et si la plaignante avait express\u00e9ment d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le comportement \u00e9tait importun ou si son comportement l'avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9.\n[89] La preuve de la plaignante a \u00e9tabli que, lors de la pr\u00e9paration des homards, lorsque Barry LaBillois a fait ces commentaires, elle lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne devrait pas dire de telles choses et qu'il ne l'insultait pas seulement elle, mais aussi toute sa famille. Il est clair que sa r\u00e9action \u00e0 ce moment indiquait que les commentaires n'\u00e9taient pas bienvenus. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'incident lors du nettoyage, rien ne donne \u00e0 penser qu'elle ait r\u00e9pondu aux commentaires \u00e0 ce moment.\n[90] Quoi qu'il en soit, j'accepterai que les commentaires de l'intim\u00e9 Barry LaBillois, \u00e9taient, les deux fois, importuns.\nC. Le comportement contest\u00e9 \u00e9tait-il suffisamment grave ou r\u00e9p\u00e9titif? [91] Je conclus que le comportement de l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas suffisamment r\u00e9p\u00e9titif ni suffisamment grave pour constituer le type de harc\u00e8lement interdit par la Loi. En effet, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, le comportement de l'intim\u00e9 qui, comme j'ai conclu, \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante se limite \u00e0 deux incidents en deux ans. Les autres \u00e9v\u00e9nements ou commentaires mentionn\u00e9s lors de l'audience ne constituent pas du harc\u00e8lement. Ils \u00e9tablissent qu'il existait un probl\u00e8me r\u00e9el dans la relation interpersonnelle et, possiblement, un manque de maturit\u00e9 et de discipline en milieu de travail, mais on ne peut pas les consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant vis\u00e9s par l'article 14, puisqu'ils ne sont pas li\u00e9s aux motifs illicites invoqu\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[92] Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l'a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Inc., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, \u00e0 la page 1282, pour conclure qu'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement, il faut d\u00e9montrer que la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 a eu un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail. Il doit y avoir un certain degr\u00e9 de gravit\u00e9 ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de la conduite pour qu'un tel environnement hostile ou empoisonn\u00e9 apparaisse. Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a expliqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Pitawanakwat c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re du Secr\u00e9tariat d'\u00c9tat) (1992), 19 C.H.R.R. D\/110, aux paragraphes 40 \u00e0 42 (T.C.D.P.), annul\u00e9e pour d'autres motifs [1994] 3 C.F. 298, (1994) 21 C.H.R.R. D\/355 (C.F. 1re inst.), ainsi que dans Dhanjal et Rampersadsingh, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, que lorsque la conduite contest\u00e9e prend la forme de propos racistes, de blagues de mauvais go\u00fbt et de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, elle doit \u00eatre persistante et fr\u00e9quente ou grave pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement. Un propos raciste isol\u00e9, m\u00eame s'il est tr\u00e8s blessant, constituera rarement \u00e0 lui seul du harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi.\n[93] Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Dhanjal, au paragraphe 215 :\nBref, plus un comportement est grave, moins il est n\u00e9cessaire qu'il soit r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 et, \u00e0 l'inverse, moins un comportement est grave, plus sa persistance doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile et constituer du harc\u00e8lement racial.\n[94] La Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec a trait\u00e9 la m\u00eame question dans l'affaire Habachi c. Commission des droits de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec, [1999] R.J.Q. 2522, R.E.J.B. 1999-14361, [1999] J.Q. no 4269 (Q.L.) (C.A.Q.). La Cour a reconnu qu'un seul acte, s'il est suffisamment grave et qu'il a un effet continu, peut constituer du harc\u00e8lement. Cependant, la Cour a aussi not\u00e9 que si l'on en venait \u00e0 conclure que les actes qui ne sont pas aussi graves constituent n\u00e9anmoins du harc\u00e8lement, l'effet serait de banaliser une disposition de la Loi qui visait une forme tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise de discrimination.\n[95] La conduite de Barry LaBillois, aussi malvenue soit-elle, a \u00e9t\u00e9 de dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e et de gravit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e. Elle se limite \u00e0 deux incidents, peut-\u00eatre trois si l'on tient compte de l'incident qui a eu lieu lorsque Phillip Fraser \u00e9tait superviseur, mais qui a cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solu. Il ne fait aucun doute que la plaignante et l'intim\u00e9 Barry LaBillois avaient des probl\u00e8mes interpersonnels qui ont pu avoir un effet n\u00e9gatif sur le milieu de travail, mais je ne suis pas convaincu qu'\u00e0 l'exception des deux ou trois incidents isol\u00e9s, ces probl\u00e8mes avaient un lien avec la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante.\n[96] La preuve \u00e9tablit qu'il n'y a pas eu plus de deux ou trois incidents au cours desquels des commentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits au sujet de la race ou de l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante. Les autres incidents - les objets qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9s, le fait que Barry LaBillois appelait la plaignante Eleanor, les disputes, le langage grossier, le questionnaire - d\u00e9montrent probablement un manque de professionnalisme de la part de Barry LaBillois, mais ils ne sont absolument pas li\u00e9s \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante. Je conclus qu'une personne raisonnable ne percevrait pas ces actes comme ayant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9, \u00e0 la persistance ou \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e des deux ou trois incidents qui, comme je l'ai conclu, \u00e9taient li\u00e9s aux motifs de distinction illicite.\n[97] Le fait que la plaignante s'est sentie oblig\u00e9e de cesser de travailler au NBAPC n'est pas une indication que l'environnement de travail s'\u00e9tait empoisonn\u00e9, au sens de l'article 14. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plusieurs fois, il ne fait aucun doute que la plaignante et Barry LaBillois avaient une relation conflictuelle et que cela a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans sa d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9missionner. Cependant, il convient aussi de noter que la plaignante, pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle elle a travaill\u00e9 au NBAPC, n'a jamais, avant l'incident du 17 juillet 2002, mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la chef Lavallee ou \u00e0 toute autre personne les difficult\u00e9s qu'elle avait avec son superviseur. La plaignante a m\u00eame accept\u00e9 de retourner travailler au NBAPC en juillet 2002. Enfin, le point central de l'analyse doit porter sur la conduite particuli\u00e8re des intim\u00e9s. Je suis convaincu qu'une personne raisonnable ne conclurait pas qu'un environnement de travail empoisonn\u00e9 ou hostile s'est \u00e9tabli \u00e0 la suite des incidents li\u00e9s aux commentaires au sujet de la race ou de l'origine nationale ou ethnique de la plaignante.\n[98] Quant \u00e0 la conduite du NBAPC dans cette situation, il est impossible de critiquer ses r\u00e9actions, puisque officiellement, le conseil n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 du fait qu'il y avait un probl\u00e8me. Pendant la majeure partie de la p\u00e9riode pertinente, la plaignante n'a jamais avis\u00e9 un responsable de la conduite de son superviseur, mais lorsqu'elle l'a fait en ao\u00fbt 2002, la chef Lavallee a r\u00e9agi de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Barry LaBillois d'expliquer ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 l'affaire, le conseil a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en septembre 2002 de r\u00e9primander par \u00e9crit Barry LaBillois pour son langage grossier et il lui a indiqu\u00e9 fermement qu'il n'accepterait plus de plaisanteries en milieu de travail. Il a aussi clairement indiqu\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s du NBAPC devaient \u00e9viter de faire des blagues ou des commentaires au sujet de l'origine nationale et ethnique de leurs coll\u00e8gues. Je suis convaincu que le NBAPC a agi de fa\u00e7on raisonnable lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 des incidents.\n[99] Je conviens que lorsque les all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement de la plaignante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es \u00e0 l'attention du NBAPC, ce dernier a eu l'obligation d'enqu\u00eater et de corriger les probl\u00e8mes en milieu de travail. Cependant, je ne souscris pas aux arguments de la plaignante selon lesquels le NBAPC a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir de prendre les mesures raisonnables. Je suis d'avis que, lorsque le NBAPC a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes, il les a trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9elle et significative.\nV. CONCLUSION [100] Je conclus que la conduite de Barry LaBillois a parfois \u00e9t\u00e9 de mauvais go\u00fbt, insultante et inappropri\u00e9e et il ne fait aucun doute que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 importun\u00e9e par sa conduite. Cependant, comme le Tribunal l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Rampersadsingh, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 60 :\nLes tentatives de d\u00e9courager ou d'emp\u00eacher les personnes de faire des observations d\u00e9nigrantes ou injurieuses \u00e0 l'endroit d'autres personnes, surtout lorsque ces expressions se rapportent \u00e0 l'un ou l'autre motif de discrimination illicite pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi, repr\u00e9sentent un objet louable en soi. Toutefois, les dispositions relatives au harc\u00e8lement dans la Loi ne visent pas \u00e0 sanctionner une conduite br\u00e8ve ou isol\u00e9e de cette nature.\nVI.

Les plaignants [1] Graham Forward et Evan Forward sont les plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ils sont fr\u00e8res. Ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre ne sont n\u00e9s au Canada; ils sont n\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis et sont citoyens am\u00e9ricains.\n[2] Graham Forward est n\u00e9 en 1982 et a toujours v\u00e9cu aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, sauf de 2000 \u00e0 2004, quand il a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Mount Allison au Nouveau\u2011Brunswick.\n[3] Evan Forward est n\u00e9 en 1984. Il a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 McGill \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al de septembre 2002 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2003. Sauf pour cette p\u00e9riode, il a toujours v\u00e9cu aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis.\n[4] \u00c0 la fin de 2001 ou au d\u00e9but de 2002, Graham et Evan ont demand\u00e9 un certificat de citoyennet\u00e9. Ils ont pr\u00e9tendu avoir droit \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 par leur m\u00e8re, Patricia Brushett.\n[5] Patricia Brushett est n\u00e9e aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis le 10 mai 1955. Elle a toujours r\u00e9sid\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Ses parents sont Ethel et Donald Brushett. Ils sont les grands\u2011parents de Graham et d\u2019Evan.\n[6] \u00c0 la naissance de Patricia, Ethel \u00e9tait alors, et est encore, citoyenne canadienne. Son p\u00e8re, Donald, qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 citoyen canadien, a obtenu la citoyennet\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1955, environ trois mois avant la naissance de Patricia. \u00c0 ce moment, il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus citoyen canadien.\n[7] Jeff Forward est le p\u00e8re de Graham et d\u2019Evan. Il est citoyen am\u00e9ricain.\nA. La Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne de 1947 [8] En 1955, \u00e0 la naissance de Patricia, la citoyennet\u00e9 \u00e9tait r\u00e9gie par la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne de 1947 (la Loi de 1947). Selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de cette Loi, une personne n\u00e9e hors du Canada est citoyenne canadienne si son p\u00e8re (ou sa m\u00e8re dans le cas d\u2019un enfant n\u00e9 hors du mariage), \u00e0 la naissance de ladite personne, est citoyen canadien. Les p\u00e8res canadiens pouvaient transmettre leur citoyennet\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs enfants n\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, mais les m\u00e8res canadiennes ne le pouvaient pas (sauf si elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas mari\u00e9es).\nB. La Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9 de 1977 [9] La Loi de 1947 a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e et remplac\u00e9e en 1977 par la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9, S.R.C., ch. C\u201129 (la Loi de 1977). Cette derni\u00e8re cr\u00e9ait trois cat\u00e9gories de citoyens canadiens en fonction de la filiation pour les personnes n\u00e9es hors du Canada :\nles personnes n\u00e9es hors du Canada apr\u00e8s le 14 f\u00e9vrier 1977 sont citoyennes canadiennes si, au moment de leur naissance, leur p\u00e8re ou leur m\u00e8re, mais non un parent adoptif, \u00e9tait canadien (alin\u00e9a 3(1)b));\nles personnes n\u00e9es hors du Canada avant le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1977 d\u2019un p\u00e8re canadien ou d\u2019une m\u00e8re canadienne, si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mari\u00e9e, sont citoyennes de naissance si leur naissance est inscrite avant une date pr\u00e9cise (alin\u00e9a 3(1)e), lequel incorpore l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi de 1947); les personnes n\u00e9es hors du Canada avant le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1977 d\u2019une m\u00e8re canadienne doivent demander la citoyennet\u00e9, puis faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et d\u2019une v\u00e9rification de leurs ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents judiciaires ainsi que pr\u00eater le serment de citoyennet\u00e9. La citoyennet\u00e9 n\u2019est pas en vigueur d\u00e8s la naissance, mais \u00e0 partir de la date o\u00f9 elle est octroy\u00e9e (alin\u00e9as 5(2)b) et 3(1)c) ainsi qu\u2019articles 12 et 22).\nC. L\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne \u00e0 Patricia Brushett [10] Au moment de sa naissance en 1955, Patricia n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne, laquelle ne pouvait \u00eatre transmise que par le p\u00e8re selon la Loi de 1947. Cependant, elle est devenue admissible en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(2)b) de la Loi de 1977. En f\u00e9vrier 2001, elle a demand\u00e9 la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne et celle\u2011ci lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 2001.\nD. Graham Forward et Evan Forward \u2013 La demande de citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne [11] Graham et Evan ont demand\u00e9 la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne \u00e0 la fin de d\u00e9cembre 2001 ou au d\u00e9but de janvier 2002 en invoquant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)b) de la Loi de 1977. Ils ont pr\u00e9tendu avoir droit \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 par leur m\u00e8re, Patricia.\n[12] Leur demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par lettre dat\u00e9e du 5 juin 2002 de Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada (CIC). Le motif de cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait qu\u2019\u00e0 leur naissance, ni leur p\u00e8re ni leur m\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait citoyen canadien. Ils n\u2019\u00e9taient donc pas admissibles \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des dispositions concernant la filiation de la Loi de 1977.\nE. Graham Forward et Evan Forward \u2013 Les plaintes \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne [13] Graham a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP le 3 janvier 2004. La plainte d\u2019Evan est dat\u00e9e du 16 janvier 2004. Dans leurs plaintes, ils soutiennent que la CIC a commis \u00e0 leur endroit un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille et le sexe, ce qui contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP).\nF. La preuve prima facie de discrimination [14] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que, dans le cadre de plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de la LCDP, il incombe d\u2019abord au plaignant d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. L\u2019all\u00e9gation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, laquelle invoque l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP, est que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 les plaignants pour un motif de distinction illicite (la situation de famille et le sexe) \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la prestation d\u2019un service destin\u00e9 au public.\n[15] L\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie relative \u00e0 cette all\u00e9gation soul\u00e8ve les questions suivantes :\nl\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne en vertu de la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9 constitue\u2011t\u2011il une prestation de services ? les demandeurs, dans leur tentative d\u2019obtenir la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne, ont\u2011ils \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s? le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, ce traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00e9tait\u2011il fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite?\nG. La citoyennet\u00e9 en tant que service \u2013 Singh, Druken, McKenna [16] Pour r\u00e9pondre d\u2019abord \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 constitue un service, les plaignants s\u2019appuient principalement sur trois arr\u00eats : Re Singh, [1989] 1 C.F. 430 (C.A.); Canada (P.G.) c. Druken, [1989] 2 C.F. 24 (C.A.); et McKenna & CCDP c. Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat, (1993) 22 C.H.R.R. 486 (T.C.D.P.); Canada (A.G.) c. McKenna, [1994] A.C.F. no 1880 (C.F. 1re inst.); Canada (P.G.) c. McKenna, [1999] 1 C.F. 401 (C.A.).\n[17] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Singh, la CCDP a saisi la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de dix renvois. Les renvois faisaient suite \u00e0 dix plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la CCDP contre le minist\u00e8re des Affaires ext\u00e9rieures et la Commission canadienne de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration. Selon ces plaintes, les intim\u00e9s avaient commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP en refusant d\u2019accorder des visas de visiteurs \u00e0 des parents des plaignants et en ne les autorisant pas \u00e0 parrainer des parents proches d\u00e9sirant immigrer au Canada.\n[18] La CCDP a tent\u00e9 de faire enqu\u00eate sur ces plaintes, mais le gouvernement \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les plaintes outrepassaient la comp\u00e9tence de la CCDP et n\u2019a pas autoris\u00e9 celle\u2011ci \u00e0 poursuivre son enqu\u00eate.\n[19] Un des motifs de l\u2019interdiction \u00e9tait que les minist\u00e8res responsables de ces questions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas fournisseurs[s] de [\u2026] services [\u2026] destin\u00e9s au public [\u2026] .\n[20] Pour la Cour d\u2019appel, la question qu\u2019il fallait trancher dans les renvois \u00e9tait de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible que les plaintes se rapportent \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires commis \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public.\n[21] \u00c0 cette question, la Cour d\u2019appel a r\u00e9pondu ceci :\nOn peut \u00e0 vrai dire soutenir que les termes qualificatifs de l\u2019article 5 \u2026 le fournisseur de\u2026 services\u2026 destin\u00e9s au public ne peuvent jouer qu\u2019un r\u00f4le limitatif dans le contexte de services qui sont rendus par des personnes physiques ou par des personnes morales et que, par d\u00e9finition, les services que rendent les fonctionnaires publics aux frais de l\u2019\u00c9tat sont des services destin\u00e9s au public et qu\u2019ils tombent donc sous le coup de l\u2019article 5. Il n\u2019est cependant pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher cette question de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape\u2011ci et il suffit de dire qu\u2019il est loin d\u2019\u00eatre clair pour moi que les services rendus, tant au Canada qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, par les fonctionnaires charg\u00e9s de l\u2019application de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration [\u2026] ne sont pas des services destin\u00e9s au public. (\u00e0 la page 440)\n[22] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Druken, les plaignantes \u00e9taient employ\u00e9es d\u2019entreprises dont leur mari \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire et se sont vu refuser des prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage. Selon la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage de 1971, les personnes employ\u00e9es par leur conjoint ou par des entreprises contr\u00f4l\u00e9es par leur conjoint n\u2019\u00e9taient pas admissibles \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage.\n[23] Les plaignantes ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP en all\u00e9guant qu\u2019il y avait eu acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial ou la situation de famille de mani\u00e8re contrevenant \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Lorsque la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal des droits de la personne, celui\u2011ci a d\u00fb \u00e9tablir si la fourniture de prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage \u00e9tait un service[\u2026] destin[\u00e9] au public . Le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un service et a conclu que les dispositions contest\u00e9es de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage de 1971 \u00e9taient discriminatoires.\n[24] Lorsque le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019annuler la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, les parties n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9battu la question des services devant la Cour d\u2019appel. Cette derni\u00e8re a seulement mentionn\u00e9 que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral semblait trouver convaincante l\u2019opinion incidente formul\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Singh.\n[25] L\u2019affaire McKenna comprend trois d\u00e9cisions, celle du Tribunal, celle de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire ainsi que celle de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019appel visant la d\u00e9cision de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance.\n[26] Shirley McKenna \u00e9tait la plaignante devant le Tribunal. Elle \u00e9tait une citoyenne canadienne habitant avec sa famille en Irlande. Elle avait deux fils, tous deux n\u00e9s au Canada, et deux filles adopt\u00e9es, toutes deux n\u00e9es hors du Canada. Ses deux filles adopt\u00e9es sont n\u00e9es avant le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1997.\n[27] Elle a demand\u00e9 des passeports canadiens pour ses deux filles, mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s de l\u2019ambassade canadienne en Irlande que, selon la Loi de 1977, ses filles ne pouvaient pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne par la filiation.\n[28] Mme McKenna a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP dans laquelle elle all\u00e9guait qu\u2019il y avait eu acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille, ce qui enfreint l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Sa plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pour \u00eatre entendue.\n[29] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 \u00e9tait un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que la Loi de 1977 avait une port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et que, lorsque des fonctionnaires appliquaient les dispositions de cette Loi, ils fournissaient un service destin\u00e9 au public.\n[30] En contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, entre autres au motif qu\u2019il y avait eu manquement \u00e0 la justice naturelle dans la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal. La Section de premi\u00e8re instance ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9e sur la question de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[31] Mme McKenna a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Celle\u2011ci a convenu avec la Section de premi\u00e8re instance qu\u2019il y avait eu manquement \u00e0 la justice naturelle et a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance, laquelle annulait la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Cependant, la Cour d\u2019appel a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire au Tribunal pour qu\u2019il rende une nouvelle d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des conclusions de la Cour quant au manquement \u00e0 la justice naturelle. Rien dans la preuve n\u2019indique que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9examin\u00e9e par le Tribunal.\n[32] Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question devant la Cour d\u2019appel de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP lorsqu\u2019il est appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9. Cependant, les deux juges formant la majorit\u00e9 ont exprim\u00e9 leur point de vue sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Voici ce que le juge Robertson avait \u00e0 dire :\nBien que j'insiste sur ce point particulier, je ne veux pas donner l'impression que je souscris \u00e0 la conclusion du Tribunal, \u00e0 savoir que l'attribution de la citoyennet\u00e9 constitue un service destin\u00e9 au public au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et que le Tribunal a donc comp\u00e9tence pour n\u00e9gocier avec le ministre responsable la fa\u00e7on dont les dispositions de la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9 doivent s'appliquer dans l'avenir. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que ce point particulier n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 repris devant le juge des requ\u00eates ou devant la Cour, je ne me propose pas de l'examiner si ce n'est pour \u00e9carter l'id\u00e9e erron\u00e9e selon laquelle la d\u00e9cision que la Cour a rendue dans l'affaire Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Druken, [1989] 2 C.F. 24 (C.A.) \u00e9taye de quelque fa\u00e7on la th\u00e8se voulant que le refus d'attribuer la citoyennet\u00e9 ait pour effet de priver une personne d'un service.\n[\u2026]\n\u00c0 mon avis, l'arr\u00eat Druken n'\u00e9taye pas la th\u00e8se selon laquelle le refus d'accorder des prestations d'assurance-ch\u00f4mage a pour effet de priver une personne d'un service au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne; [il] montre uniquement que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 la chose.\n[33] Le juge Strayer nourrissait les m\u00eames doutes que le juge Robertson quant \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne n\u00e9e hors du Canada pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un service destin\u00e9 au public.\n[34] Bien que la jurisprudence n\u2019ait pas d\u00e9finitivement tranch\u00e9 la question, de toute \u00e9vidence, les tribunaux sont principalement d\u2019avis que le refus d\u2019octroyer la citoyennet\u00e9 ne constitue pas un refus de fournir un service au sens de la LCDP.\nH. La port\u00e9e du terme services \u2013 L\u2019article 5 de la LCDP [35] Les plaignants et la Commission sont d\u2019avis que le rejet des demandes de citoyennet\u00e9 de Graham et d\u2019Evan constituent un traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture de services.\n[36] Dans leurs observations, ils pr\u00e9cisent que la question en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019est pas la citoyennet\u00e9 en tant que telle, mais plut\u00f4t le droit qu\u2019a une personne demandant la citoyennet\u00e9 de voir sa demande examin\u00e9e et trait\u00e9e d\u2019une fa\u00e7on non discriminatoire. Le service en cause \u00e9tait l\u2019examen des demandes de citoyennet\u00e9.\n[37] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9finir la plainte. La preuve et les observations en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne portaient pas sur la conduite de repr\u00e9sentants du minist\u00e8re, l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ou la mise en \u0153uvre de politiques et de lignes de conduite minist\u00e9rielles.\n[38] L\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a comme seule origine le libell\u00e9 de la Loi de 1977. En examinant une demande de citoyennet\u00e9, les fonctionnaires appliquent des crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gaux explicites \u00e0 des faits incontest\u00e9s, ni plus, ni moins. Toute contestation du processus d\u2019examen d\u2019une demande constitue en fait une contestation de la Loi.\n[39] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis que la citoyennet\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre \u00e0 juste titre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un service. Il s\u2019appuie sur les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents concluant que la citoyennet\u00e9 constitue un privil\u00e8ge \u2013 et non un droit \u2013 que les \u00c9tats peuvent octroyer ou refuser selon les conditions qui leur semblent indiqu\u00e9s.\n[40] La jurisprudence r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement que la citoyennet\u00e9 conf\u00e8re un statut politique particulier \u00e0 une personne, lequel comporte non seulement des droits et des devoirs, mais tient \u00e9galement une fonction hautement symbolique. La distinction entre les citoyens et les non\u2011citoyens est reconnue dans la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s. Voir Law Society of British Columbia c. Andrews, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 143; Canada c. Chiarelli, [1992] 1 R.C.S. 711.\n[41] \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 ne constitue pas un service au sens de la LCDP. Contrairement aux autres lois, comme la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage, la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9 a des r\u00e9percussions d\u00e9finitives et transformatrices sur les individus qu\u2019elle reconna\u00eet comme Canadiens. Comme l\u2019indiquent les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, la citoyennet\u00e9 est un statut distinct octroy\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00c9tat, un statut comportant une dimension constitutionnelle. La qualifier de simple service fait fi du r\u00f4le fondamental qu\u2019elle joue dans la d\u00e9finition de la relation entre les individus et l\u2019\u00c9tat.\n[42] Bien que cela ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire pour tirer la conclusion que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9e ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019ajouterais que le l\u00e9gislateur pourrait raisonnablement avoir eu l\u2019intention de donner des indications quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e du terme services de l\u2019article 5 en le pla\u00e7ant avec les termes biens , installations et moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement (noscitur a sociis, la r\u00e8gle des mots associ\u00e9s ). De ce point de vue, il est tr\u00e8s difficile de conclure que l\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 est un service ayant des caract\u00e9ristiques semblables aux biens, aux installations ou aux moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement.\n[43] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que les plaignants et la Commission n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue qu\u2019il y avait eu discrimination. Je n\u2019ai pas besoin de me pencher sur les autres questions relatives \u00e0 la preuve prima facie.\nI. La discrimination par association \u2013 Qui sont les victimes? \u2013 L\u2019application r\u00e9troactive ou r\u00e9trospective de la LCDP [44] Les plaignants et la Commission ont soutenu que la discrimination en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9coulait de celle dont a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime la grand\u2011m\u00e8re des plaignants, Ethel. Celle\u2011ci a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement discriminatoire, fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi de 1947. En outre, les effets de la discrimination qu\u2019a v\u00e9cue Ethel se sont fait sentir sur sa fille Patricia (n\u00e9e en 1955), laquelle n\u2019a pas pu faire valoir son droit \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne.\n[45] Selon les plaignants et la Commission, la Loi de 1977 a continu\u00e9 de traiter Patricia de mani\u00e8re in\u00e9quitable. Ils soutiennent que la diff\u00e9rence de traitement affectant Patricia \u2013 diff\u00e9rence fond\u00e9e sur le sexe de sa m\u00e8re \u2013 a ensuite vis\u00e9 ses fils, les plaignants Graham et Evan.\n[46] Pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sous ce jour, des aspects cl\u00e9s de la preuve des plaignants portent clairement sur des faits et des situations juridiques qui ont eu lieu ou qui existaient avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LCDP en 1978.\n(i) L\u2019arr\u00eat Benner [47] L\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Benner c. Canada (Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat) [1997] 1 R.C.S. 358 est essentiel \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution des questions soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes.\n[48] M. Benner est n\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis en 1962 d\u2019une m\u00e8re canadienne et d\u2019un p\u00e8re am\u00e9ricain. Il a demand\u00e9 la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne le 27 octobre 1988 sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi de 1977. \u00c0 titre de personne n\u00e9e hors du Canada avant le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1977 d\u2019une m\u00e8re canadienne, M. Benner \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(2)b) de la Loi de 1977. Ainsi, il devait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire et d\u2019une v\u00e9rification de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents judiciaires.\n[49] La v\u00e9rification des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents judiciaires de M. Benner a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 de plusieurs infractions criminelles. Le registraire de la citoyennet\u00e9 l\u2019a inform\u00e9 que la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne lui \u00e9tait interdite et sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e le 17 octobre 1989.\n[50] Il a contest\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision en soutenant que la Loi de 1977 imposait des exigences plus rigoureuses aux personnes demandant la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne sur la base de la filiation maternelle que sur celles r\u00e9clamant la citoyennet\u00e9 sur la base de la filiation paternelle. Il a soutenu que cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement appliqu\u00e9e aux personnes n\u00e9es hors du Canada de m\u00e8res canadiennes avant le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1977 contrevenait au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[51] L\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. La question pr\u00e9liminaire que devait trancher la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9tait de savoir si l\u2019application du paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte entra\u00eenait une application r\u00e9troactive ou r\u00e9trospective ill\u00e9gitime de la Charte aux faits en cause.\n[52] En examinant si la demande de M. Benner n\u00e9cessitait une application r\u00e9troactive de la Charte, la Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir si les faits en question t\u00e9moignaient d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement pr\u00e9cis et isol\u00e9 ou constituaient un statut permanent. Dans le cas de M. Benner, son statut \u00e0 sa naissance \u00e9tait celui d\u2019une personne n\u00e9e hors du Canada avant le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1977 d\u2019une m\u00e8re canadienne et d\u2019un p\u00e8re am\u00e9ricain. Ce statut est demeur\u00e9 inchang\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Charte et au moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter sa demande de citoyennet\u00e9.\n[53] Pour la Cour supr\u00eame, aux fins de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 15 de la Charte, le moment important n\u2019\u00e9tait pas celui o\u00f9 M. Benner avait acquis le statut en question, mais celui o\u00f9 ce statut lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 reproch\u00e9 ou l\u2019avait priv\u00e9 du droit d\u2019obtenir un avantage. La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que ce moment avait eu lieu quand le registraire de la citoyennet\u00e9 a examin\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 sa demande, soit le 17 octobre 1989. Cette date est celle \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019acte discriminatoire se serait produit.\n[54] La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu qu\u2019on n\u2019attribue pas d\u2019effet r\u00e9trospectif \u00e0 la Charte si elle est appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 des personnes qui ont acquis un certain statut avant son entr\u00e9e en vigueur et que ce statut est demeur\u00e9 inchang\u00e9 apr\u00e8s son entr\u00e9e en vigueur. En cons\u00e9quence, la plainte de discrimination de M. Benner pouvait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e en regard de la Charte.\n[55] La Cour s\u2019est \u00e9galement pench\u00e9e sur l\u2019argument voulant que M. Benner tentait d\u2019invoquer, pour son propre profit, la violation des droits d\u2019un tiers. En d\u2019autres termes, la pr\u00e9tendue discrimination issue de la Loi de 1977 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re, et non \u00e0 lui.\n[56] La Cour supr\u00eame a rejet\u00e9 cet argument en concluant que M. Benner \u00e9tait la principale cible de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe \u00e9tablie dans la Loi de 1977. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(2)b) qu\u2019a contest\u00e9 M. Benner ne d\u00e9termine pas le droit \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 de sa m\u00e8re. Celle\u2011ci n\u2019\u00e9tait concern\u00e9e que parce que les droits de M. Benner \u00e9taient tributaires de sa filiation maternelle.\nJ. La discrimination par association \u2013 Qui est la victime de l\u2019acte discriminatoire? [57] L\u2019arr\u00eat Benner est utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, car il situe dans le temps le moment o\u00f9 s\u2019est produit l\u2019acte discriminatoire dont les plaignants pr\u00e9tendent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. Le moment pertinent auquel doit s\u2019appliquer l\u2019analyse est celui o\u00f9 le statut de Graham et d\u2019Evan leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 reproch\u00e9 ou les a priv\u00e9s du droit d\u2019obtenir un avantage. Ils ont le statut de petits\u2011enfants n\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger d\u2019une grand\u2011m\u00e8re canadienne depuis la naissance. Mais jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils demandent la citoyennet\u00e9, la loi r\u00e9gissant leur droit \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 eux.\n[58] Si l\u2019on suit l\u2019arr\u00eat Benner, l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ne se serait pas produit avant 2002, lorsque la demande de citoyennet\u00e9 des plaignants a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e sur la base de crit\u00e8res qui, selon eux, contreviendraient \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[59] Apr\u00e8s avoir situ\u00e9 dans le temps l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 (bien apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LCDP), il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si les plaignants ont subi une diff\u00e9rence de traitement fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite, soit le sexe et la situation de famille.\n[60] Encore une fois, l\u2019arr\u00eat Benner est utile. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 il pr\u00e9cise que la Loi de 1977 a maintenu la discrimination \u00e9tablie dans la Loi de 1947, cette derni\u00e8re peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre examin\u00e9e en regard de l\u2019article 15 de la Charte. De mani\u00e8re semblable, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019argument voulant que l\u2019origine v\u00e9ritable de toute diff\u00e9rence de traitement se trouve dans la Loi de 1947, aujourd\u2019hui abrog\u00e9e, ne vient pas en aide \u00e0 la cause des plaignants. On leur a refus\u00e9 la citoyennet\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi de 1977. C\u2019est l\u2019application de cette loi qui constitue le fondement de leur plainte.\n[61] Cela nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 examiner pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment quelles sont les dispositions de la Loi de 1977 que les demandeurs cherchent \u00e0 contester. Tous deux sont n\u00e9s apr\u00e8s 1977. Par cons\u00e9quent, les dispositions qui les touchent directement sont les alin\u00e9as 3(1)a) et 3(1)b), lesquels leur refusent la citoyennet\u00e9 puisque ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre de leurs parents n\u2019\u00e9tait citoyen au moment de leur naissance et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas n\u00e9s au Canada. Cependant, ils ne soutiennent pas que les alin\u00e9as 3(1)a) et 3(1)b) \u00e9tablissent une situation discriminatoire fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et la situation de famille.\n[62] Bien qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019aient pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, les demandeurs semblent (compte tenu de leur plaidoirie finale) soutenir que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)e), qui prot\u00e8ge le statut des enfants n\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger d\u2019hommes (et de femmes non mari\u00e9es) canadiens \u00e9tabli par la Loi de 1947, traite d\u00e9favorablement les enfants n\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger de femmes canadiennes mari\u00e9es. En outre, et par extension, ils pr\u00e9tendent que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)e) traite d\u00e9favorablement les enfants n\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger d\u2019enfants n\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger de femmes canadiennes mari\u00e9es.\n[63] Cet argument soul\u00e8ve un probl\u00e8me quant \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 pour agir. Les plaignants ne se trouvent pas dans la situation de M. Benner. Ils sont plut\u00f4t dans la situation des enfants de M. Benner, des enfants n\u00e9s hors du Canada. Les plaignants et la Commission affirment que cette distinction ne fait aucune diff\u00e9rence. L\u2019arr\u00eat Benner s\u2019applique tout autant aux petits\u2011enfants. L\u2019intim\u00e9e plaide le contraire.\n[64] Il semble ind\u00e9niable que l\u2019arr\u00eat Benner serait plus semblable si Patricia avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Patricia, au m\u00eame titre que M. Benner, serait en mesure de r\u00e9sister \u00e0 l\u2019argument voulant que la discrimination impos\u00e9e par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)e) soit en fait impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00e8re du demandeur, car Patricia, comme M. Benner, serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme la cible principale de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe \u00e9tablie dans la loi. \u00c0 titre de victime de premi\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ration du r\u00e9gime d\u2019exclusion perp\u00e9tu\u00e9 par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)e), Patricia poss\u00e9derait la qualit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour soulever la question. Comme M. Benner, elle pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9crite comme la cible v\u00e9ritable de la disposition et comme la personne ayant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat le plus direct pour r\u00e9clamer son examen en regard de la l\u00e9gislation interdisant la discrimination.\n[65] Toutefois, Patricia n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme une victime en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce; il n\u2019est demand\u00e9 aucune ordonnance \u00e0 son intention.\n[66] Les plaignants ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme les cibles principales de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)e) ni comme les personnes ayant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat le plus direct \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer son examen en regard de la Charte. Ce r\u00f4le revient \u00e0 Patricia. Contrairement \u00e0 leur m\u00e8re, les plaignants ne peuvent \u00eatre directement touch\u00e9s par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)e) parce qu\u2019ils ne sont pas n\u00e9s avant 1977 et, pour cette raison, n\u2019ont jamais eu droit, tout juste avant 1977, de devenir citoyen en vertu de la Loi de 1947. Puisqu\u2019ils ne sont pas touch\u00e9s directement par les dispositions contest\u00e9es, et puisqu\u2019ils ne demandent pas r\u00e9paration pour une personne qui l\u2019est, les plaignants n\u2019ont pas la qualit\u00e9 requise pour demander r\u00e9paration en vertu de la LCDP.\n[67] Les plaignants et la Commission insistent quand m\u00eame pour affirmer que les fr\u00e8res sont des victimes prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la LCDP, sans contredire l\u2019affirmation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans Benner selon laquelle une partie ne peut invoquer la violation des droits garantis par la Charte d\u2019un tiers. En premier lieu, le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP est plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reux pour ce qui est de la qualit\u00e9 pour agir; des plaignants peuvent demander r\u00e9paration au nom d\u2019autres victimes (paragraphes 40(2), 50(1) et 53(2)). Fait plus important, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Benner m\u00eame, la Cour supr\u00eame a implicitement approuv\u00e9 une forme de qualit\u00e9 indirecte pour agir, par laquelle le traitement dont a fait l\u2019objet la victime d\u00e9coule du traitement discriminatoire impos\u00e9 \u00e0 ses parents.\n[68] La Cour supr\u00eame a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il existait un lien entre les droits de M. Benner et la diff\u00e9renciation faite entre les hommes et les femmes par la loi. Les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es faisaient d\u00e9pendre les droits de M. Benner en mati\u00e8re de citoyennet\u00e9 de la question de savoir si celui de ses parents qui \u00e9tait canadien \u00e9tait un homme ou une femme. Nier \u00e0 M. Benner la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019agir permettrait au l\u00e9gislateur de contourner les r\u00e8gles antidiscrimination en \u00e9tablissant une discrimination indirecte au lieu de mentionner directement les cibles de la discrimination.\n[69] De plus, la Cour supr\u00eame a fait valoir que le lien entre un enfant et son p\u00e8re ou sa m\u00e8re a un caract\u00e8re particuli\u00e8rement unique et intime; l\u2019enfant ne peut rien changer \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ses parents. Lorsque l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des avantages tels que la citoyennet\u00e9 est restreint pour un motif aussi intimement li\u00e9 \u00e0 un demandeur et aussi ind\u00e9pendant de sa volont\u00e9 que le sexe de celui de ses parents qui est canadien, le demandeur a qualit\u00e9 pour invoquer la protection de l\u2019article 15 de la Charte.\n[70] De l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame a formul\u00e9 ces observations \u00e0 titre de remarques incidentes, puisqu\u2019elles \u00e9taient pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9es de la d\u00e9claration suivante :\nJe m\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter que je n\u2019entends pas, par les pr\u00e9sents motifs, cr\u00e9er un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de discrimination par association. Je laisse express\u00e9ment l\u2019examen de cette question \u00e0 une autre occasion, car il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre pour trancher le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. (Le juge Iaccobucci, au paragraphe 82.)\n[71] Le fait demeure que la Cour supr\u00eame ne se penchait pas sur une situation o\u00f9 un petit\u2011fils invoquait l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ses grands\u2011parents.\nK. Application r\u00e9troactive ou r\u00e9trospective de la LCDP [72] Il faut \u00e9tablir une autre distinction importante. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Benner, la Cour supr\u00eame devait se prononcer sur l\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 au fils d\u2019une femme qui \u00e9tait canadienne au moment o\u00f9 il est n\u00e9. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on demande au Tribunal de reconna\u00eetre la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne de Graham et d\u2019Evan, dont la m\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas canadienne lorsqu\u2019ils sont n\u00e9s.\n[73] Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame si en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce aucun autre obstacle n\u2019emp\u00eachait le Tribunal d\u2019octroyer la citoyennet\u00e9 aux plaignants, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas, il serait n\u00e9cessaire de modifier la citoyennet\u00e9 de leur m\u00e8re Patricia de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne au moment de leur naissance. Dans ce cas uniquement, leur situation serait comparable \u00e0 celle de M. Benner.\n[74] Mais comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, Patricia ne demande pas r\u00e9paration devant le Tribunal et les plaignants ne l\u2019ont pas fait pour elle. En outre, consid\u00e9rer les plaignants comme \u00e9tant n\u00e9s d\u2019une m\u00e8re th\u00e9oriquement canadienne de naissance (si elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9e d\u2019un p\u00e8re canadien au lieu d\u2019une m\u00e8re canadienne) requiert d\u2019appliquer la LCDP de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 changer le statut de Patricia \u00e0 sa naissance (en 1955). Pour ce faire, il faudrait appliquer la loi r\u00e9troactivement, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire que la LCDP, qui est entr\u00e9e en vigueur en 1978, serait invoqu\u00e9e pour modifier le statut juridique de Patricia \u00e0 sa naissance, en 1955.\n[75] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 (Latif c. Canada, [1980] 1 C.F. 687 (C.A.)), et il s\u2019agit d\u2019une pr\u00e9somption en common law, que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur en \u00e9dictant de nouvelles lois n\u2019est pas de les faire appliquer de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 modifier l\u2019effet juridique pass\u00e9 d\u2019une situation pass\u00e9e. Rien n\u2019indique que le l\u00e9gislateur avait l\u2019intention que la LCDP soit appliqu\u00e9e d\u2019une autre mani\u00e8re. La pr\u00e9somption contre la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 demeure valide.\n[76] Sauf modification au statut de Patricia, Graham et Evan sont des enfants n\u00e9s de parents non canadiens. En cons\u00e9quence, leur situation ne peut \u00eatre facilement compar\u00e9e \u00e0 celle de M. Benner ou \u00e0 qui que ce soit d\u2019autre \u00e0 qui la citoyennet\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 syst\u00e9matiquement refus\u00e9e en raison du sexe de celui de ses parents qui \u00e9tait canadien.\nII. Conclusion [77] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que les plaintes de Graham Forward et d\u2019Evan Forward doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJ.

Au d\u00e9but de l'audience, l'agent du greffe du Tribunal a lu la cause devant \u00eatre entendue et a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appel des parties. Mme Suzanne Dandenault, l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e Paterson GlobalFoods Incorporated, \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente.\n[2] La plaignante, Mary C. Shepel, n'a pas comparu et elle n'a \u00e9galement pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ouverture de l'audience. Personne n'a comparu non plus en son nom.\n[3] Personne n'a comparu au nom de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[4] Le Tribunal a suspendu l'audience jusqu'\u00e0 9 h 50 ce jour-l\u00e0. \u00c0 la reprise de l'audience, l'agent du greffe a de nouveau proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appel des parties. L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente, mais Mme Shepel n'\u00e9tait toujours pas pr\u00e9sente et personne ne la repr\u00e9sentait.\n[5] Le 19 ao\u00fbt 2008, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 que l'audience relative \u00e0 sa plainte soit tenue au cours de la derni\u00e8re semaine d'octobre ou dans les derni\u00e8res semaines de novembre 2008. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une autre demande de la plaignante pour qu'une date d'audience soit fix\u00e9e, le Tribunal a avis\u00e9 Mme Shepel le 11 septembre 2008 que l'audience se tiendrait \u00e0 Winnipeg du 24 au 28 novembre 2008.\n[6] Conform\u00e9ment aux directives rendues par le Tribunal le 26 septembre 2008, le d\u00e9lai de la demanderesse pour la pr\u00e9sentation d'une divulgation compl\u00e8te, au sens de l'article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9 au 3 octobre 2008. Le 9 octobre 2008, la plaignante a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal que sa divulgation serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 14 octobre 2008.\n[7] La plaignante n'a pas respect\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai quant \u00e0 la divulgation au sens du paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal. Elle n'a pas demand\u00e9 une autre prorogation du d\u00e9lai, ni une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence avec le Tribunal pour discuter des questions en suspens portant sur la divulgation.\n[8] Un avis confirmant les dates d'audience en novembre a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Shepel le 10 octobre 2008. Le 6 novembre 2008, Mme Shepel a \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour l'aviser qu'elle n'avait plus les ressources ni le temps n\u00e9cessaires pour poursuivre sa pr\u00e9paration au processus du Tribunal.\n[9] Le 13 novembre 2008, le Tribunal a de nouveau pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Shepel le lieu, les dates et l'heure de l'audience portant sur sa plainte. Mme Shepel a r\u00e9pondu le 20 novembre 2008 qu'elle ne participerait pas \u00e0 l'audience \u00e0 la date pr\u00e9vue.

Hadjis\n[1] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour obtenir une ordonnance du Tribunal interdisant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 Jason Ouwendyk et \u00e0 son repr\u00e9sentant d'utiliser, dans les documents \u00e9crits d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce, un langage visant \u00e0 [traduction] rabaisser le plaignant, le Tribunal, la Commission ou tout agent de la Cour. La Commission s'oppose \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce que le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Ouwendyk en l'esp\u00e8ce, Alexan Kulbashian, utilise les lettres HR plut\u00f4t que Human Rights (droits de la personne) lorsqu'il fait mention de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dans ses observations \u00e9crites. La Commission demande \u00e9galement une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 cette pratique. La Commission demande \u00e9galement que l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l'intim\u00e9 et la [traduction] liste des t\u00e9moins pour la contestation constitutionnelle, qui contiennent l'expression en question ci-dessus, soient [traduction] rejet\u00e9s et d\u00e9clar\u00e9s radi\u00e9s du [traduction] dossier du Tribunal.\n[2] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal doit fournir aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat (counsel dans la version anglaise), des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. N\u00e9anmoins, le Tribunal a par le pass\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 une personne qui n'est pas avocate et qui repr\u00e9sente une partie \u00e0 compara\u00eetre aussi (voir Brown c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 30, aux paragraphes 86 et 87; Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 TCDP 27, au paragraphe 16). Cependant, le Tribunal peut utiliser son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour n'autoriser la participation que des repr\u00e9sentants qui, \u00e0 son avis, facilitent la proc\u00e9dure d'arbitrage au lieu de l'entraver (Filgueira, au paragraphe 15). Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsque le repr\u00e9sentant d'une partie se comporte d'une mani\u00e8re offensante ou irrespectueuse envers les autres parties ou le Tribunal m\u00eame, \u00e0 mon avis, le Tribunal a le droit d'exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour refuser \u00e0 cette personne l'autorisation de repr\u00e9senter la partie dans la proc\u00e9dure.\n[3] En l'esp\u00e8ce, je note que M. Kulbashian a trait\u00e9 le plaignant de [traduction] menteur. Il semble avoir qualifi\u00e9 la Commission ou le Tribunal de [traduction] brute en habits d'avocat et un membre du Tribunal de [traduction] fanatique.

Jensen\n[1] Il s'agit des motifs que j'ai prononc\u00e9s oralement \u00e0 l'audience.\n[2] L'audience a eu lieu le lundi 3 mars 2008 \u00e0 Ottawa, avec une liaison vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 Edmonton pour permettre aux intim\u00e9s, Ronald et Heather Fleming, de compara\u00eetre sans avoir \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 Ottawa. Au d\u00e9but de l'audience, l'agent du greffe du Tribunal a lu la Cause devant \u00eatre entendue et a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appel des parties. Mme Ikram Warsame \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente et a comparu au nom de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[3] Le plaignant, beachesboy@aol.com, n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l'audience, ni d'ailleurs quiconque devant le repr\u00e9senter.\n[4] Les intim\u00e9s, M. Ronald et Mme Fleming, n'\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l'audience, ni d'ailleurs quiconque devant les repr\u00e9senter.\n[5] Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 au gestionnaire de l'\u00e9difice de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de s'assurer qu'il n'y avait personne dans le hall de la Cour r\u00e9pondant au nom de Fleming. Le gestionnaire a r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'y avait personne dans le hall.\n[6] L'agent du greffe a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 l'avis d'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce, dat\u00e9 du 1er f\u00e9vrier 2008. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'avis d'audience avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s par messagerie et au plaignant par courrier \u00e9lectronique. Le Tribunal prend note que, dans des lettres pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, les intim\u00e9s ont fait savoir qu'ils n'accepteraient pas la signification \u00e0 personne de documents chez eux. Par cons\u00e9quent, toutes les lettres leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es par courrier r\u00e9gulier ou par messagerie.\n[7] L'agent du greffe a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des copies de lettres du plaignant dans lesquelles il pr\u00e9cisait qu'il ne serait pas en mesure de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience pour les trois prochains mois et qu'il ne serait pas non plus en mesure de participer \u00e0 une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence en raison d'engagements professionnels. L'agent du greffe a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une copie du courrier \u00e9lectronique que le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 au plaignant le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2008, dans lequel il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le Tribunal est tenu d'instruire les plaintes de discrimination avec diligence. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas disponible pour discuter de la question d'un ajournement avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que cette question soit abord\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de l'audience du lundi 3 mars 2008.\n[8] Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement fait savoir au plaignant, dans le courrier \u00e9lectronique qu'il lui a envoy\u00e9 le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2008, que le plaignant pouvait pr\u00e9senter l'avis d'audience du Tribunal \u00e0 son employeur pour motiver son absence. La Commission pouvait \u00e9galement demander une assignation l'enjoignant \u00e0 compara\u00eetre.\n[9] Le plaignant a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 fixer les dates de l'audience et il \u00e9tait au fait de ces dates depuis un certain temps. En outre, le plaignant a pris part \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de tenir l'audience \u00e0 Ottawa, avec une liaison en vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence avec Edmonton.\n[10] Mme Warsame, au nom de la Commission, a fait savoir \u00e0 l'audience lundi matin que le plaignant n'avait pas r\u00e9pondu aux demandes de renseignements relatives aux dispositions de d\u00e9placement pour l'audience du 3 mars 2008. En outre, le plaignant n'a pas r\u00e9pondu aux demandes d'aide de la Commission pour la pr\u00e9paration du cahier de preuve documentaire pour l'audience. Mme Warsame a affirm\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait son seul t\u00e9moin et que, par cons\u00e9quent, s'il ne comparaissait pas \u00e0 l'audience, elle ne serait pas en mesure de produire une preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[11] Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que l'audience soit ajourn\u00e9e et reprise deux jours plus tard, afin de permettre au plaignant et aux intim\u00e9s de communiquer avec le Tribunal et de faire savoir s'ils avaient l'intention de continuer la proc\u00e9dure, s'ils souhaitaient faire reporter de nouveau l'audience ou s'ils souhaitaient que l'affaire soit rejet\u00e9e.\n[12] Le Tribunal a alors envoy\u00e9 une lettre le m\u00eame jour, le 3 mars 2008, dans laquelle il est confirm\u00e9 que l'audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e jusqu'au 5 mars 2008. Dans cette m\u00eame lettre, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que l'affaire \u00e9tait en instance devant le Tribunal depuis octobre 2006. Le Tribunal a l'obligation d'instruire les plaintes avec diligence. Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande visant \u00e0 reporter de trois mois la tenue de l'audience \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que le plaignant et\/ou les intim\u00e9s comparaissent \u00e0 l'audience le 5 mars 2008. Le Tribunal a fait savoir que, si le plaignant ou les intim\u00e9s ne se pliaient pas \u00e0 ces directives, il pouvait rejeter la plainte (en fait, la lettre envoy\u00e9e par le greffe du Tribunal invitait le plaignant \u00e0 compara\u00eetre ou \u00e0 soumettre des observations).\n[13] Le Tribunal a repris l'audience aujourd'hui, le mercredi 5 mars 2008. Mme Warsame a comparu au nom de la Commission. Ni le plaignant ni les intim\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents aujourd'hui, ni d'ailleurs quiconque les repr\u00e9sentant. Un membre du personnel de l'\u00e9difice de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 Edmonton a inform\u00e9 l'agent du greffe que personne ne s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce aujourd'hui.\n[14] Le plaignant et les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal pour expliquer leur absence et n'ont pas non plus sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d'autres dates raisonnables pour un ajournement.\n[15] Mme Warsame a d\u00e9crit sommairement les tentatives faites par la Commission pour communiquer avec le plaignant afin qu'il confirme ses intentions relativement \u00e0 la plainte. Le plaignant n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ces demandes de renseignements. Pour cette raison, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas lui envoyer d'assignation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience aujourd'hui. Mme Warsame a fait savoir que le plaignant est son seul t\u00e9moin. Compte tenu de l'absence de ce dernier aujourd'hui, elle n'est pas en mesure de produire de preuve \u00e0 l'appui de la plainte.\n[16] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que la plainte n'est pas fond\u00e9e et celle-ci est donc rejet\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 53(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nKaren A.

Hadjis\n[1] Les 9 et 10 mai 2007, deux employ\u00e9s de la Commission, Hannya Rizk et Dean Steacy, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 ce moment, j'ai ordonn\u00e9 que les personnes autres que les parties et leurs repr\u00e9sentants soient exclues de la salle d'audience pendant le t\u00e9moignage de ces deux t\u00e9moins, en vertu de l'article 52 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Des st\u00e9nographes judiciaires ont transcrit leur t\u00e9moignage. Les notes st\u00e9nographiques ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par l'ordonnance d'exclusion et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es aux parties.\n[2] Les deux t\u00e9moins doivent maintenant continuer leur t\u00e9moignage le 25 mars 2008. M. Lemire et la Canadian Association for the Freedom of Expression ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. Rogers Publishing Limited, une division de Rogers Media Inc., a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande semblable au nom de Maclean's Magazine, en demandant express\u00e9ment que des repr\u00e9sentants du magazine soient autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 assister \u00e0 l'audience, \u00e0 l'observer et \u00e0 faire rapport du t\u00e9moignage qui sera entendu \u00e0 l'audience. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada affirme pour sa part que cette audience doit se d\u00e9rouler conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la [traduction] proc\u00e9dure habituelle voulant que le Tribunal tienne des audiences publiques, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit convaincu de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 du huis-clos pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de tous les participants.\n[3] La Commission propose dans ses observations que l'ordonnance soit maintenue, mais que d'autres mesures soient prises pour [traduction] mieux r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des membres du public qui souhaitent assister \u00e0 l'audience, dont une liaison t\u00e9l\u00e9visuelle avec une autre salle, ce qui permettrait au public d'observer l'audience sans pouvoir observer les t\u00e9moins.\n[4] J'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate que j'ai rendue pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9e.\n[5] Pour bien comprendre cette question, il est important de comprendre le contexte dans lequel j'ai rendu ma premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision. \u00c0 la demande de M. Lemire, le Tribunal avait d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Rizk et \u00e0 M. Steacy des assignations les enjoignant \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience. Dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi du 8 mai 2007, la Commission a envoy\u00e9 par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur une lettre au Tribunal dans laquelle, en vertu de l'article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, elle s'opposait formellement \u00e0 la divulgation de l'apparence de ses employ\u00e9s dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal et attestait que ces renseignements ne devaient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s pour des raisons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, soit d'assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de ces individus durant et apr\u00e8s leur t\u00e9moignage. La Commission a ajout\u00e9 que, \u00e0 la suite de l'objection qu'elle a exprim\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 37, elle a [traduction] ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Rizk et \u00e0 M. Steacy de ne pas compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience du Tribunal, mais de demeurer disponibles jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la question de cette objection soit tranch\u00e9e.\n[6] Quand l'avocat de la Commission a comparu \u00e0 l'audience le 9 mai 2007, sa position \u00e9tait sans \u00e9quivoque : [traduction] [...] nous avons invoqu\u00e9 l'article 37. Si aucune mesure n'est mise en place, nous l'invoquons. Si les mesures que je demande aujourd'hui sont mises en place, alors nous ne l'invoquerons pas et nous retirerons notre objection fond\u00e9e sur l'article 37 relativement \u00e0 leur comparution et \u00e0 la divulgation de leur apparence.\n[7] Ce matin-l\u00e0, j'ai rendu verbalement ma d\u00e9cision concernant l'exclusion des non-parties de la salle d'audience. Cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e en grande partie sur cette possibilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9occupante que la Commission invoque l'article 37 si les [traduction] mesures qu'elle demandait n'\u00e9taient pas [traduction] mises en place. L'audience s'est poursuivie, mais la Commission a n\u00e9anmoins invoqu\u00e9 l'article 37 en de nombreuses occasions pour s'opposer aux questions pos\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Rizk et \u00e0 M. Steacy par l'avocat de M. Lemire. La Commission all\u00e9guait des raisons de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique pour justifier ses objections.\n[8] M. Lemire a par la suite contest\u00e9 ces objections devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, laquelle a comp\u00e9tence exclusive pour rendre une d\u00e9cision quand de telles questions sont soulev\u00e9es devant le Tribunal. Toutefois, fait int\u00e9ressant, il semble que, quelques semaines avant l'audience de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, pr\u00e9vue pour le 15 janvier 2008, la Commission a divulgu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Lemire les renseignements vis\u00e9s par la requ\u00eate concernant l'article 37. La Cour a donc jug\u00e9 que, puisque les renseignements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s, elle ne pouvait plus examiner [traduction] en bonne et due forme la demande concernant l'article 37, car la divulgation avait en fait rendu la question th\u00e9orique. En effet, la Commission a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment divulgu\u00e9 les renseignements qui, selon ce qu'elle avait pr\u00e9tendu auparavant, ne pouvaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s en vertu de l'article 37. Je note que la Commission a \u00e9galement retir\u00e9, devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, son objection fond\u00e9e sur l'article 37 \u00e0 ce que soient d\u00e9livr\u00e9es les assignations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre de Bell Canada (voir la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, 15 janvier 2008, dossier no T-860-07).\n[9] La fa\u00e7on dont s'est r\u00e9solue la question concernant l'article 37 me porte \u00e0 mettre en question le bien-fond\u00e9 de l'invocation par la Commission de motifs de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique relativement au t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins en cause.\n[10] Fait encore plus important, cependant, puisque j'ai maintenant eu la chance d'examiner la question dans des circonstances diff\u00e9rentes de celles dans lesquelles je me trouvais le matin du 9 mai 2008, je ne suis pas convaincu que les t\u00e9moins seraient expos\u00e9s \u00e0 un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation qui ferait en sorte que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es l'emporterait sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, comme le pr\u00e9voit l'alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi, ni qu'il existe une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger, comme le pr\u00e9voit l'alin\u00e9a 52(1)d) de la Loi. Les passages d'un site Internet cit\u00e9s par la Commission dans ses observations ne satisfont pas \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res, \u00e0 mon avis. Ils ne t\u00e9moignent pas d'un risque plus grand que celui qui a \u00e9man\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9 de commentaires adress\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres participants, notamment aux avocats, aux membres instructeurs et aux membres du personnel du Tribunal ainsi qu'aux parties elles-m\u00eames, en l'esp\u00e8ce ou dans d'autres affaires portant sur l'article 13.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'annule l'ordonnance. L'audience sera publique, comme l'exige le paragraphe 52(1) de la Loi. Je noterais pour le dossier que la Commission fait erreur quand elle affirme dans ses observations que l'ordonnance faisait suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate que j'avais rendue le 7 mai 2007, laquelle ne faisait qu'exclure les cam\u00e9ras des locaux du Tribunal. Cette d\u00e9cision a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l'ordonnance d'exclusion. Puisqu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 que je r\u00e9vise ma d\u00e9cision du 7 mai, les cam\u00e9ras demeureront exclues des locaux du Tribunal.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res et du Commerce international (MAECI). La requ\u00eate concerne une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Sally Wade, laquelle soutient que son employeur, le MAECI, a commis \u00e0 son endroit un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur son \u00e9tat matrimonial et sa situation familiale en refusant de lui accorder un logement de trois chambres en application des Directives sur le service ext\u00e9rieur. Les Directives font partie de la convention collective conclue entre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et l'agent n\u00e9gociateur de Mme Wade, l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (AFPC).\n[2] L'intim\u00e9, le minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res et du Commerce international (MAECI), sollicite une ordonnance enjoignant :\nl'adjonction du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada) \u00e0 titre de partie \u00e0 la plainte; l'adjonction de l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (AFPC) en tant qu'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte; la modification de l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause pour que soit substitu\u00e9 le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada au minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res et du Commerce international.\n[3] La plaignante ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 ces demandes, mais elle pr\u00e9cise que, si l'AFPC est ajout\u00e9e en tant qu'intim\u00e9e, la plainte devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e pour inclure les articles 9 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L'article 10 est d\u00e9j\u00e0 invoqu\u00e9 dans la plainte originale.\n[4] L'article 9 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour une organisation syndicale, d'\u00e9tablir \u00e0 l'endroit d'un individu des restrictions, des diff\u00e9rences ou des cat\u00e9gories ou de prendre toutes autres mesures susceptibles de le priver de ses chances d'emploi ou d'avancement.\n[5] L'AFPC ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 l'adjoindre \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9e, pas plus qu'elle ne s'oppose \u00e0 l'adjonction du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor ou \u00e0 la modification de l'intitul\u00e9. Finalement, l'AFPC ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 l'ajout de l'article 9 \u00e0 la plainte.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9, le MAECI, ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 la modification de la plainte pour qu'y soit inclus l'article 9.\n[7] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\nL'adjonction du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et de l'AFPC en tant qu'intim\u00e9s\n[8] L'alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la LCDP conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjoindre des parties \u00e0 ses proc\u00e9dures. Une nouvelle partie ne devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'instruction que si l'ajout de la partie est n\u00e9cessaire pour que l'on puisse trancher convenablement la plainte et s'il existe un fondement valide aux all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre la nouvelle partie. Le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement tenir compte du pr\u00e9judice que peut causer aux parties leur adjonction \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure (Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone c. TELUS Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., [2003] D.C.D.P. no 29; Brown c. Commission de la capitale nationale, [2003] D.C.D.P. no 36; Smith c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux, 2005 TCDP 23).\n[9] Le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et l'AFPC ont n\u00e9goci\u00e9 les modalit\u00e9s des Directives sur le service ext\u00e9rieur; ce sont le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et l'AFPC qui connaissent ces Directives. Le MAECI n'a pas le pouvoir d'en modifier le libell\u00e9. Si la plainte est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e et qu'une mesure de redressement est ordonn\u00e9e, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et l'AFPC sont les organisations qui mettront en uvre la mesure de redressement relative aux Directives. Par cons\u00e9quent, ces deux organisations jouent un r\u00f4le important dans la r\u00e9solution de la plainte. En outre, il existe un fondement valide aux all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles l'AFPC et le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor puissent partager la responsabilit\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 la plainte serait jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e.\n[10] Les intim\u00e9s propos\u00e9s ne se sont pas oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 leur adjonction en tant que parties et n'ont pas soutenu qu'ils subiraient un pr\u00e9judice de leur adjonction \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne que le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et l'AFPC soient ajout\u00e9s en tant que parties \u00e0 la plainte.\nLa modification de la plainte pour inclure l'article 9 de la LCDP\n[12] La plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que la plainte soit modifi\u00e9e pour qu'y soit inclut l'article 9 de la LCDP, lequel interdit \u00e0 une organisation syndicale d'\u00e9tablir des restrictions, si elles sont fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite, aux chances d'emplois d'un employ\u00e9.\n[13] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir de modifier une plainte lorsque les modifications concernent le cadre de la plainte originale et lorsque les parties ont re\u00e7u un pr\u00e9avis suffisant de la modification (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations c. AFPC, 2006 CF 704, aux paragraphes 50 \u00e0 52).\n[14] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'AFPC ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 la modification propos\u00e9e de la plainte. Elle affirme qu'il est essentiel d'invoquer les bons articles de la Loi pour assurer que les questions soient pleinement expos\u00e9es au Tribunal.\n[15] Je souscris \u00e0 cet argument de l'AFPC. J'ordonne que la plainte soit modifi\u00e9e afin d'inclure l'article 9 de la LCDP.\nLa modification de l'intitul\u00e9\n[16] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 affirme qu'il faut substituer le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant de la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, au MAECI en tant que partie intim\u00e9e.\n[17] L'intim\u00e9 soutient que le MAECI n'a pas de personnalit\u00e9 juridique distincte. Il n'est qu'un minist\u00e8re du gouvernement du Canada. Par cons\u00e9quent, le MAECI n'a pas la capacit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre partie \u00e0 une plainte. La partie comp\u00e9tente \u00e0 la plainte est le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant de la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Munro c. Canada (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 1 (Gen. Div.), aux pages 10 \u00e0 13).\n[18] Bien que l'article 7.2 de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques conf\u00e8re au Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor la capacit\u00e9 d'agir \u00e0 titre de partie intim\u00e9e, autant le MAECI que le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor sont sous l'\u00e9gide du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'intim\u00e9 soutient qu'il n'est n\u00e9cessaire de nommer ni le MAECI ni le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor dans l'intitul\u00e9. Cependant, l'intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne s'opposait pas \u00e0 ce que l'intitul\u00e9 soit modifi\u00e9 pour qu'il soit libell\u00e9 ainsi : Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res et du Commerce international et le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor).\n[19] La plaignante et l'AFPC n'ont formul\u00e9 aucune objection \u00e0 ce que l'intitul\u00e9 soit modifi\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 son libell\u00e9 sera celui propos\u00e9 ci-dessus.\n[20] Un examen de la jurisprudence invoqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 ainsi que des lois pertinentes r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'intim\u00e9 a raison et que la plaignante aurait d\u00fb porter plainte contre le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada comme il se doit. En fait, le Tribunal a rendu des ordonnances semblables dans d'autres affaires o\u00f9 prenait part la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Plante c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2003 TCDP 28; Wiseman c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2007 TCDP 13; Guay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, [2004] D.C.D.P. no 32).\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne que l'intitul\u00e9 soit modifi\u00e9 pour qu'il soit libell\u00e9 ainsi : Sally Wade c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res et du Commerce international et le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor) et l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada.\nKaren A.
