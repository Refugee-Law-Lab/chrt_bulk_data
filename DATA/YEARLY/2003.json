Bell Canada\nCollection\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nDate\n2003-01-10\nNeutral citation\n2003 CHRT 1\nFile number(s)\nT503\/2098\nDecision-maker(s)\nDeschamps, Pierre; Sinclair, Grant, Q.C.\nDecision type\nRuling\nDecision Content\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nBETWEEN:\nCOMMUNICATIONS, ENERGY AND\nPAPERWORKERS UNION OF CANADA,\nFEMMES-ACTION\nComplainants\n- and -\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION\nCommission\n- and -\nBELL CANADA\nRespondent\nRULING ON DISCLOSURE AND PRODUCTION\n2003 CHRT 1 2003\/01\/10\nPANEL: J. Grant Sinclair, Chair\nPierre Deschamps, Member\n[1] This ruling is in response to two motions, one brought by the Canadian Human Rights Commission and one by the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada. Both motions seek an order from this Tribunal that Bell Canada disclose and produce to them the documents specified in the notices of motion. The Commission and CEP argued that the specified documents are arguably relevant to the issues in this case.\n[2] Bell has opposed both motions on the following grounds:\nbecause of their scope, size and nature, the requests are unduly burdensome to Bell in terms of the time required to search for the documents and the costs involved; the Commission and CEP represented from the outset that the only documents that they would rely on to prove their case were 74 documents generated by the Joint Study and selected by the Commission and CEP from among many other documents of the Joint Study. Bell says that it relied on this representation to prepare its defense and conduct its cross-examinations. To order further disclosure at this point in the hearing, would allow the Commission and CEP to materially alter their case to Bell's detriment and they should be estopped from doing so and\/or be taken to have waived their right to further disclosure; the Commission and CEP, knowing that Bell challenged the validity of the Joint Study for the purposes of section 11 of the Act, should have reasonably anticipated that more than 74 documents were necessary to make their case and their request is untimely and prejudicial to Bell.\n[3] The Commission and CEP have consistently taken the position that the Joint Study was their case and they would be relying on the 74 Joint Study documents, which they had identified, to prove their case.\n[4] The hearing of the complaints by this Tribunal began in January 1999. The Tribunal dealt with a number of preliminary motions brought by Bell and only began hearing the merits of the complaints on April 17, 2000. Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure requires each party to give written notice of all documents in its possession relevant to any matter in issue in the case. None of the parties provided such disclosure nor have any of the parties, at any time, requested that the Tribunal order such disclosure.\n[5] The hearing on the merits continued until November 2, 2000, when the Federal Court, Trial Division suspended the hearing because of Tribunal institutional bias. The hearing resumed on September 10, 2001, following the reversal decision of the Federal Court of Appeal.\n[6] The record shows that there have been disclosure requests by both the Commission and CEP for documents beyond the 74 Joint Study documents. On April 25, 2000, Bell provided, at the request of the Commission, General Circulars pertaining to the issue of establishment. On September 5, 2001, CEP requested from Bell documents relating to population data, documents relating to exhibit HR-76 and reports or analysis relating to the reliability of the Joint Study in Bell's possession.\n[7] During the January 22, 2002 hearing week, it became apparent to the Tribunal that the issues with respect to each party's case had not yet been fully defined. At this time, Commission counsel told the Tribunal that he had no idea of the specifics of Bell's defense. Bell's counsel, for his part, stated that Bell still did not know the case of the Commission. Further, CEP counsel advised the Tribunal that there remained outstanding disclosure requests and indicated that efforts would be made to resolve them through counsel. If not so resolved, CEP might request a blanket disclosure order from the Tribunal.\n[8] In an attempt to define the issues and resolve the disclosure questions, the Tribunal, with the agreement of the parties, directed that each party provide a statement of case setting out the material facts to be proved, the legal issues raised by the case, the witnesses to be called and the remedies sought. The Tribunal, again with the agreement of the parties, did not make a blanket disclosure order, but left disclosure questions to be resolved in good faith by the parties. Should any dispute arise relating to disclosure, the Tribunal would deal with it.\n[9] The Commission, C.T.E.A., CEP and Femmes-Action filed their statements of case on April 2, 2002, and Bell filed on May 13, 2002. The parties continued discussions on document disclosure from that time onward but could not come to any agreement. Thus, these two motions.\n[10] On the evidence and given our knowledge of the issues in this case, we have concluded that the documents requested meet the test of arguable relevance. Bell did not seriously dispute this.\n[11] As to the burdensome nature of the disclosure request, evidence given on the motions indicates that the documents requested are located in six to eight filing cabinets at the Bell offices, 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re Street, Montreal. Further, Bell's counsel advised the Tribunal that no JEWC documentation had been found at that location. In response, Commission counsel withdrew the request for disclosure of the JEWC documents unless Bell, on its own initiative, was able to locate them elsewhere. In these circumstances, Bell's counsel conceded that a search for the documents at 1000 De la Gaucheti\u00e8re only would not be unduly burdensome. We agree.\n[12] In our view, this is sufficient to dispose of the two motions. The Commission and CEP have requested disclosure and production of the documents itemized in the two motions. We fail to see how Bell is prejudiced by disclosure. Bell is free to object to the production of the documents disclosed. Bell is free to object to the admissibility into evidence of any of the documents disclosed or produced. In our opinion, Bell's submissions on waiver, estoppel and reasonable anticipation are premature.\nORDER The motions are granted and the Tribunal orders as follows:\nBell shall, in a timely manner and using all reasonable efforts, prepare a list of all documents relating to the Joint Study that are found in the filing cabinets referred to in the evidence of Linda Benwell located at the Bell offices, 1000 De la Gaucheti\u00e8re, Montreal. The list shall include any documentation relating to the JEWC job evaluation process and any hard copies of electronic communications, correspondence or documentation for the period 1991-1993 prepared by Mich\u00e8le Boyer, Andr\u00e9 Beaudet, Matina Bisbicos or Louise Belle-Isle. If no JEWC documentation is found at 1000 De la Gaucheti\u00e8re, Bell is not required to search elsewhere for such documentation. Bell is not required to search for any Joint Study related electronic communications, correspondence or documentation other than that referred to in paragraph 1. Bell shall provide the Commission and CEP with the list of documents referred to in paragraph 1 and in the event that Bell, on its own initiative, finds any JEWC documentation at some other location, then it shall provide the Commission and CEP with a list of these documents. Bell shall produce copies of any of the documents on the lists referred to in paragraph 4 requested by the Commission and CEP. Bell shall also produce to CEP copies of the documentation requested to paragraphs 3(j) and 3(k) of CEP's Notice of Motion. Any undue costs incurred by Bell for copying the documentation referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 shall be paid for by the Commission and CEP. The hearing scheduled for the week of Monday, January 13, 2003, is adjourned to Monday, January 27, 2003. If Bell disputes the production as ordered in paragraphs 5 and 6, the Tribunal, on motion, will hear this matter commencing on Monday, January 27, 2003. If Bell does not dispute production, the hearing on the merits will resume on January 27, 2003. If Bell cannot reasonably meet the schedule for disclosure and production, Bell should so advise the Tribunal and the Tribunal will deal with this accordingly.\nOriginal signed by\nJ.

Retention of Jurisdiction\n[1] The Complainant worked as a bus operator for the Respondent. Throughout the course of his employment, he was absent from work for a significant number of days, mainly on account of illness. Eighteen years after he was hired, the Respondent dismissed the Complainant due to his chronic absenteeism. As a result, the Complainant filed the present complaint in which he alleges that the Respondent discriminated against him by refusing to accommodate him and by refusing to continue to employ him because of his disability, contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act). The disability consists principally of post-traumatic stress disorder (also known as PTSD) and ailments related thereto.\n[2] The Complainant's employer at the time of his termination in 1996 was the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, which operated Ottawa's public transit system (otherwise known as OC Transpo). His complaint was filed several months later and the same organization was named as the Respondent. In 2001, pursuant to s. 9 of the City of Ottawa Act, 1999, OC Transpo's operations, including all its assets and liabilities, were transferred to the amalgamated City of Ottawa.(1) Ms. Lois Emburg, a manager with the City of Ottawa, stated during her testimony that the City of Ottawa is accepting any liability to be attributed to the Respondent in the present case. In light of her representations, the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission shall continue to be treated as the Respondent in this case. It should be noted, though, that according to the abovementioned legislative provision, the Respondent was dissolved on January 1, 2001.\nI. FACTS [3] Most of the facts are not in dispute. All of the parties agree that during his employment with the Respondent (a total of about 18 years and 2 months), the Complainant was absent for about 1664 full days and 33 partial days. His absences were mostly related to illness. The Respondent does not call into question the genuineness of these illnesses.\nA. The Complainant's Employment History with the Respondent [4] The Complainant was hired by the Respondent as a bus operator in November 1977. His employment was subject to an initial probationary period. The Respondent's records demonstrate that from the outset, the Respondent was concerned with the Complainant's level of absenteeism, so much so that the probationary period was extended by three months in January of 1979. In the month of September 1979, he was even suspended for several days because of his absenteeism, in accordance with the Respondent's policy in place at that time. No evidence was led as to the nature of the illnesses or other causes that resulted in the Complainant's absences during this early period. The Complainant acknowledges that he was made aware early on that excessive absenteeism within the OC Transpo workforce was an ongoing cause of concern for the employer.\n[5] In his testimony, the Complainant brought up some of the events in his life that he feels may have contributed to the onset years later of post-traumatic stress disorder. In 1979, his relationship with a woman to whom he was engaged to be married suddenly ended. This break-up was devastating for him but it did not lead to his being absent from work. In October of 1980, the Complainant's mother died of cancer. He also describes this loss as devastating, noting that he had maintained a very close relationship with her. He took three days off work on bereavement leave, as permitted under the collective agreement.\n[6] Only a couple of months later, in December 1980, the Complainant was the victim of a violent assault while he was driving his bus. A passenger wearing army fatigues and a balaclava over his head entered the bus and without any warning hit the Complainant on the side of his face, knocking him unconscious. The Complainant was treated at the hospital and released the same day. He did not return to his job until one week later.\n[7] No evidence was led detailing the Complainant's attendance during the early 1980's other than an acknowledgement by him and the Commission that he worked on and off. However, his attendance sheets for the years 1984 and following were produced. In 1984, the Complainant was absent for the entire period from March to early September. The attendance sheet indicates that he was in receipt of worker's compensation benefits during this period but no explanation was provided at the hearing as to the nature or cause of his illness or disability. In 1985, the Complaint was absent due to illness for thirteen full days and four partial days. In 1986, he was absent for thirty full days and one partial day.\n[8] In 1987, the Complainant's father suddenly died. The Complainant testified that this was also a significant and disturbing loss for him. He took the permitted bereavement leave of three days. During 1987, he was absent 42 full days and another 4 partial days, due to illness. The Complainant was on sick leave for 28 full days and seven partial days in 1988.\n[9] On March 7, 1989, the Complainant was interviewed by management regarding his level of absenteeism. As luck would have it, only two weeks later, another unsettling incident occurred while he was at work. A male passenger entered his bus and began yelling at him. The passenger eventually got off the bus, but just two days later, he confronted the Complainant again. The Complainant was standing outside his bus, at the starting point of his bus route, when the individual approached him. The man had his hand in his pocket and began telling the Complainant that he was going to kill him. Two other bus operators happened to witness the incident and one called over a supervisor. The supervisor reacted by assisting the individual onto another bus, but he did not make a report nor call the police. The Complainant claims that he was genuinely scared of the passenger and that he felt very unprotected and unsafe as a result of the manner in which his employer had dealt with the threat.\n[10] Although he did not miss any work at the time of these incidents, in the weeks and months that followed, the number of absences due to illness increased significantly. On July 18, 1989, the employer interviewed him regarding his absenteeism. The Complainant recalls that following the March incidents, he began getting pains in [his] stomach and was feeling quite sick. He went off work from December 1989 until February 1990, his medical certificates indicating that he was suffering primarily from gastro-intestinal problems. He returned to his job in early March 1990 but ceased working on March 21, 1990. This leave of absence ended up lasting for 199 working days. During this period, he was compensated by the Workers' Compensation Board, as his disability was deemed to be related to the trauma associated with the death threat made against him. The medical certificates issued by the Complainant's family physician during this period refer to his anxiety state, job tension and adjustment reaction.\n[11] While the Complainant was on leave in 1990, OC Transpo's Occupational Health Unit (Health Unit) communicated regularly with him to follow up on his status and his expected date of return to work. According to the evidence adduced by the Respondent, the Health Unit had a mandate that included gathering information regarding the condition of employees on sick leave and advising the divisions where they worked (their employing divisions) when and if they were ready to return to work. The Health Unit would also assess whether a non-occupational disability claim was well founded, based on the medical information available. It was composed of several nurses who were employed full time as well as one medical doctor who was not an employee of the Respondent but who would be asked occasionally to provide an opinion. The Health Unit's activities were integral to the program that the Respondent had established to manage the attendance of its employees (Attendance Management Program). One of the main reasons for the existence of this separate unit was to protect the confidentiality of the employees' medical information. As such, the Health Unit never disclosed to management the details of an employee's condition. It would only provide to employing divisions general conclusions and opinions as to an employee's preparedness to return to work.\n[12] On December 14, 1990, based on the medical information collected from the Complainant and his physician, the Health Unit determined that commencing January 2, 1991, he would be able to resume regular job duties, provided that he be initially assigned to work four hours per day instead of eight. This type of transitional activity was referred to as a process of work hardening. The Complainant performed these modified duties until February 25, 1991, when he went on sick leave, suffering from back pain and abdominal pain, according to the medical certificates submitted to the Respondent at the time.\n[13] By April 1991, the Complainant's family physician had come to the realization that the Complainant was preoccupied with being assaulted on his job, to the point of almost paranoid feelings. The family physician apparently concluded that the Complainant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The physician therefore informed the Respondent that the Complainant could not yet return to work. He referred the Complainant to the Royal Ottawa Hospital for a psychiatric assessment. Dr. Hamilton Sequeira, M.D., a psychiatrist, examined the Complainant on May 17, 1991, and made a provisional diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder of longstanding with anxiety, depressive, somatic manifestations. In presenting his diagnosis, Dr. Sequiera referred in his report to the 1980 assault and the 1989 threat as well as the sudden deaths of the Complainant's parents. The Complainant's family physician issued an updated medical certificate declaring that the Complainant would be unable to return to work for an indefinite period. The Complainant received workers' compensation benefits while on this extended medical leave.\n[14] Dr. Sequiera recommended a therapeutic approach for the Complainant that included medications as well as cognitive behavioural therapy to desensitize him from his trauma related negative constructs and feelings. For this latter purpose, Dr. Sequiera sought the assistance of Dr. David Erickson, PhD, R. Psych., who was at that time doing his internship to become a clinical psychologist, a recognition that he achieved in 1994. Dr. Erickson testified that cognitive behavioural therapy involves two components: the behavioural aspect encompasses the breaking down of a person's fear into small manageable steps. The cognitive aspect is conducted once some success has been achieved with respect to the behavioural element, and consists of the individual attempting to imagine in advance, doing the activities which are at the source of his anxiety.\n[15] Dr. Erickson began treating the Complainant on November 4, 1991. He determined that the Complainant was a good candidate for cognitive behavioural therapy. Between November 1991 and August 1992, Dr. Erickson met the Complainant weekly. He kept the Health Unit abreast of the Complainant's progress. He states in the expert's report that accompanied his testimony in this case, that by July 1992, after eight months of cognitive behavioural therapy combined with medication, the Complainant's state was dramatically improved and ready for a graduated return to work. As part of this transition to full-time work it was agreed between the Health Unit and Drs. Sequeira and Erickson that the Complainant begin this process by driving what was known as the DERC shuttle bus. DERC is the acronym for the Disabled Employees Review Committee, made up of OC Transpo employee and management representatives. The DERC was established by the Respondent in order to assist in the reintegration of disabled employees into the workforce. The DERC shuttle bus was in fact a mini bus in which operators were driven to various locations to take over runs from other drivers. The only passengers on this bus were other OC Transpo employees.\n[16] The Complainant drove this vehicle from mid-July to mid-September 1992, following which he was assigned to modified duties (four hours per day) driving regular OC Transpo passenger buses. According to Dr. Erickson, by mid-October 1992, the Complainant was symptom-free and back to his normal level functioning. The Health Unit accordingly recommended to the Complainant's employing division that he could return to full time regular job duties beginning October 14, 1992.\n[17] Between December 7, 1992 and January 14, 1993, the Complainant booked off sick for a total of thirteen full days and two partial days, suffering from blurred vision, dizziness, insomnia and gastroenteritis. Dr. Erickson noted, after speaking with the Complainant on December 14, 1992, that his anxiety problems had returned, in part as a result of driving on some of the routes that he most feared prior to his treatment. Medication was prescribed for him by Dr. Sequeira and regular visits were scheduled with Dr. Erickson.\n[18] Unfortunately, on January 15, 1993, a bus that the Complainant was driving was hit from the rear by another vehicle, as a result of which he suffered a whiplash injury (cervical neck strain). According to his family physician, the injury was such that he could not return to work until May 1993. Dr. Erickson notes in his expert's report that the Complainant experienced great frustration at being prevented from working as a result of the accident, and some gastro-intestinal problems and headaches that he suffered over this period were likely related to this distress. However, Dr. Erickson points to the absence at that time of any anxiety, mood problems or sleep disturbance that would indicate residual post-traumatic stress disorder.\n[19] After being on leave due to the work-related whiplash injury for a total of 92 working days, the Complainant returned to his regular job duties at the beginning of June 1993. In August 1993, he went on sick leave for a total of six days and one partial day. According to the medical certificate that he submitted, he was suffering from acute anxiety. By October 1993, the Complainant had developed a major sleep disturbance and had to take another leave of absence that was to extend until June 1994.\n[20] His sleep had been reduced to two to three hours per night. Dr. Sequeira transferred the Complainant to the care of another psychiatrist with a specialty in sleep disorders. His treatment included prescribing medication to help the Complainant sleep and to prevent the occurrence of periodic partial leg movements that were awakening him during his sleep. By May 1994, this psychiatrist deemed the sleep problems to be now under control and believed that the Complainant was ready to return to work.\n[21] On May 27, 1994, the Health Unit sent a memo to the Complainant's employing division stating that his prognosis was now for regular attendance at work. The memo referred to an unnamed treating physician of the Complainant who had declared that his medical problem had been resolved and that it should not cause him any future problem. In addition, the Complainant was examined by the external medical practitioner of the Health Unit and the memo notes his observation that the Complainant's attitude was very positive, more so than in earlier assessments conducted by the same doctor in 1992 and 1993.\n[22] The Complainant therefore returned to his regular job duties on June 2, 1994. Shortly after returning to work, he was confronted by several teenagers while driving his bus, in a manner that he perceived as threatening. He felt scared and vulnerable, as if someone was always out to get him. He found himself unable to sleep again so he took a higher dose of his sleep medication. This resulted in drowsiness that rendered him unable to perform his work properly. On June 5, 1994, the Superintendent of Operational Personnel, Mr. Ron Mooney, having observed the Complainant's reduced faculties, instructed him to cease operating a bus. The superintendent sent a memo several days later to the Health Unit asking that the Complainant be reassessed to determine if he was capable of returning to regular full time employment.\n[23] By July, 1994, Dr. Sequeira had resumed all of the Complainant's psychiatric care. The Complainant also recommenced receiving treatment from Dr. Erickson. Within weeks, Dr. Sequeira observed that the Complainant had become so depressed, anxious and sleep-deprived that it became necessary to admit him into the Mood Disorders Unit of the Royal Ottawa Hospital. He was diagnosed with major depression, sleep disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. He was discharged from the hospital on September 20, 1994. The depression and sleep troubles were resolved by June 1995.\n[24] As these problems diminished, though, the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms became apparent again. His avoidance pattern was consistent with a fear of being assaulted, combined with regular daytime flashbacks. Dr. Erickson implemented another program of cognitive behavioural therapy for the Complainant. According to Dr. Erickson, as part of the therapy, the Complainant exerted great effort, as he relived the fear of being assaulted on a daily basis. In Dr. Erickson's opinion, the therapy proved effective and by February 1996, (the month in which the Complainant was dismissed) the post-traumatic stress disorder had been vanquished.\nB. Events in the Months Leading up to the Complainant's Dismissal [25] On October 26, 1995, the Health Unit interviewed the Complainant, in accordance with a policy that required such meetings periodically with employees who were in receipt of long-term disability benefits. It determined, based on the Complainant's comments as well as information obtained from his physicians, that he hoped to return to his regular occupation as a bus operator. According to a memo prepared by the Health Unit after the meeting, the Complainant was advised that his job with the Respondent was only protected for a period of 24 months following the date when he began receiving long term disability benefits. This period was to come to an end on February 2, 1996. If by that time he did not return to his own job or to some other job within OC Transpo, the Respondent would make a decision as to his continuing status and would in all likelihood [...] medically terminate him.\n[26] On December 13, 1995, Dr. Sequeira filled out a form for the Ontario Ministry of Transport. The Complainant's C Class driver's licence, which permitted him to operate buses, had been downgraded because he was disabled on a long-term basis. The application for regaining the permit required that a physician report on the driver's medical condition. Dr. Sequeira stated on the form that the Complainant was ready to regain his licence as he was much improved of the symptomatology of fear-anxiety-avoidance-depression that was part of his post-traumatic stress disorder.\n[27] On January 31, 1996, Dr. Sequeira and Dr. Erickson signed a letter that they had jointly prepared, addressed to the Health Unit of OC Transpo, in which they stated the following:\nAlain is now in the final stages. Within a few weeks, the [cognitive behavioural therapy] regarding the post-traumatic anxiety will be sufficiently advanced to allow a safe return to work. The feared stimuli, i.e. clothing worn by his assailant, will no longer prompt incapacitating anxiety. Rather, Alain will experience only mild tremulousness.\nHis sleep disturbance is similarly well controlled. While he continues to have anxiety-related nightmares, they are no longer severe enough to disrupt his sleep. He does continue to have difficulty waking in the morning, however: once he has had time to gradually adjust to a structured daily routine, this problem will return to normal limits.\nFinally, Alain's depressed mood is no longer an issue. In the past month, he has experienced mild dysphoria an average of 2-3 times per week, where each occasion lasts 1-2 hours. No period of severe or sustained depressed mood has occurred in the past month. Thus, Alain's mood is clearly within normal limits.\nDrs. Sequiera and Erickson then went on to describe the Complainant's medications, noting that they would not interfere with his ability to operate an OC Transpo bus. It was also pointed out that the Complainant would continue to see both specialists over the following several months, just to deal with any remaining anxieties and to monitor the medications. The following conclusions were made towards the end of their letter:\nDuring this time, Alain's health will be best served by beginning with part-time duties, and gradually building up to full-time duties. In the initial period of readjustment, extreme hours are contra-indicated because of their potential for sleep disturbance. We would greatly appreciate being consulted in preparing increases in Alain's scope of duties, as experience from his past has shown that it is possible to do too much too soon.\nIn sum, the prognosis is very good. Alain has worked hard to regain positive and constructive moods, such that he is now well within normal limits. The PTSD-related anxiety is much diminished, and will not interfere with his performance as an operator.\n(My emphasis)\n[28] The Complainant contacted the head nurse of the Health Unit to discuss his coming back to work, several days in advance of the February 2, 1996 deadline that the Respondent had set for his return. She advised him to simply show up at work on that designated day and speak to Mr. Mooney, the Superintendent of Operational Personnel. The Complainant did so, and when he met with Mr. Mooney, he explained that he was ready to work, requesting only that some adjustments be made to ease his transition back, in accordance with the recommendations of his psychiatrist and psychologist. Mr. Mooney informed the Complainant that no such work-hardening adjustments would be made available to him and, according to the Complainant, when he asked if he could be assigned to work at some other job at OC Transpo, he was told there was nothing. Instead, Mr. Mooney said that the Complainant's file was under investigation and that the Complainant would be informed of the outcome two weeks later. The Complainant's testimony regarding these meetings was not contradicted and neither the head nurse nor Mr. Mooney testified in this case.\n[29] On February 6, 1996, Mr. Mooney wrote to the Health Unit asking if the Complainant's present condition, for which he had just received treatment, was the same as the condition for which there had been a prognosis of regular attendance back in May 1994. He also asked if the Health Unit was convinced, based on the medical information, that the Complainant should return to work as a bus operator when his licence was reinstated. In the Health Unit's reply, dated February 9, 1996, specific reference was made to the recently obtained opinions of Drs. Sequiera and Erickson to the effect that the Complainant could begin with part-time duties and gradually build up to full time duties. The Health Unit, however, concluded as follows:\nTaking into consideration the medical information on file at present, the fact that Mr. Parisien does not hold a class C licence at present, as well as his past record of attendance, the Health Unit is not fully convinced at this time that Mr. Parisien will be able to perform his duties as a bus operator on a regular basis.\nIf the Transportation Division [the Complainant's employing division] is able and prepared to offer Mr. Parisien alternate employment, we will contact his medical advisors to quantify his restrictions and to obtain a more complete prognosis. Please advise us as to your decision.\n(My emphasis)\n[30] Mr. Mooney met with the Complainant about a week later, on February 15, 1996, and advised him that his employment was terminated. In a follow-up letter addressed to the Complainant on February 19, 1996, Mr. Mooney stated:\nThis letter is to confirm our meeting held on February 15, 1996 to clarify your employment status with the Commission.\nBased on the information presented at our meeting we find it necessary to terminate your employment with the Commission due to chronic innocent absenteeism effective February 15, 1996.\n[31] The Complainant claims that he pleaded with Mr. Mooney to allow him to return to work for OC Transpo but he was told that the decision to terminate would stand. He contends that at the time of his termination he was feeling quite good and wanted to get back right away to his ordinary duties as a bus operator. He acknowledges that he was not yet one hundred per-cent and that he could not have immediately returned to regular full-time bus driving duties. He would, however, have been able to perform modified job duties during a period of transition, as Drs. Sequiera and Erickson had recommended.\nC. Events Subsequent to the Complainant's Termination [32] The Complainant filed a grievance against his dismissal several days later. The grievance passed through the required stages in the grievance process and was ultimately ruled upon through an expedited arbitration process on December 4, 1998. The labour arbitrator decided that there was just cause for the Complainant's termination and dismissed the grievance. He found that the Respondent reasonably concluded, on the evidence before it that the Complainant would not be able to perform his duties as a bus operator on a regular basis.\n[33] In a preliminary motion presented to the Tribunal, prior to the hearing on the merits of the present case, the Respondent submitted that the subject matter of the Complainant's human rights complaint fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the labour arbitrator and that the doctrines of issue estoppel and cause of action estoppel deprived the Tribunal of jurisdiction to hear the matter. The motion was dismissed by Tribunal Chairperson Anne L. Mactavish on July 15, 2002.(2) In her ruling, the Chairperson found that the issue before the arbitrator was whether the Complainant's termination was unjust and not whether he had been a victim of a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act.\nD. The Evidence of the Experts [34] The Commission called Dr. Erickson and Dr. Sequeira to testify as experts at the hearing. They were qualified as persons who have acquired special or peculiar knowledge through study, education and experience with the Complainant, such that they could assist the Tribunal with respect to their interactions with him and their respective fields generally (psychology for Dr. Erickson and psychiatry for Dr. Sequeira).\n[35] In Dr. Erickson's opinion, between 1989 and 1996 inclusively, the Complainant experienced two distinct episodes of post-traumatic stress disorder, one at the beginning of this period (from the threat to his life in 1989 until his return to work in September, 1992) and another towards the end (from June 1994 until February 1996). Between these bookends, the Complainant also passed through an episode of severe sleep, mood and generalized anxiety, from about October 1993 until June 1995, overlapping onto the final PTSD bookend. Dr. Erickson believes that this episode was likely related - in an indirect way to the Complainant's initial bout with PTSD.\n[36] Dr. Erickson finds that the Complainant exhibited all of the classic elements of post-traumatic stress disorder, including:\n\u00b7 experiencing a traumatic event,\n\u00b7 intrusive daytime reliving of that event, as well as recurring nightmares,\n\u00b7 avoiding certain behaviours that he used to enjoy in the past, and\n\u00b7 being in a state of persistent hyper-arousal.\n[37] For his part, Dr. Sequeira agrees that the initial diagnosis of PTSD was well-substantiated and that the PTSD had fully developed by 1989. In his opinion, the second episode, in 1994-95, was a re-emergence of the PTSD and not so much a bookend. With respect to some of the other illnesses that caused the Complainant to be absent from work, Dr. Sequeira points out that it is not uncommon for persons suffering from PTSD to also experience generalized anxiety disorder, phobia, major depression and sleep disorder. According to Dr. Sequeira, a connection may even exist between PTSD and some of the other ailments from which the Complainant suffered, including diarrhea and muscle spasms, although it is also possible that these symptoms were unrelated.\nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ANALYSIS A. The Law [38] Section 7 of the Act declares that it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to continue to employ an individual, or to treat an employee in an adverse differential manner, on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. Disability is included amongst the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination set out in s. 3 of the Act. According to s. 25, disability, for the purposes of the Act, means any previous or existing mental or physical disability and includes disfigurement and previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug.\n[39] Section 15 (a), as it was designated prior to the 1998 amendments to the Act, (3) provides that it is not a discriminatory practice if the differential treatment exercised by the employer is based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). In 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada, in what are generally referred to as the Meiorin(4) and Grismer (5) cases, had the occasion to restate the approach to be followed whenever such a defence is invoked. The Court reaffirmed that a complainant bears the initial burden of establishing that the standard or policy adopted by the employer-respondent is prima facie discriminatory.\n[40] Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the employer-respondent may justify the impugned standard by establishing on the balance of probabilities:\nthat the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; that the standardis reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.(6)\nB. The Prima Facie Case [41] The Commission submits that one need only look at the Respondent's Statement of Particulars, which was prepared prior to the hearing in accordance with the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure, to conclude that a prima facie case has been established. Amongst the items detailed in the document are the material facts that the Respondent seeks to prove in support of its case (Interim Rule 6(1)(a)). The Respondent declares, as a material fact, that the Complainant's absences from work were the result of illnesses, some of which were diagnosed as being PTSD and chronic sleep disorder. After detailing the number of days that the Complainant was absent from work, the Respondent states that on February 15, 1996, the Complainant was dismissed due to chronic absenteeism, as there was no prospect of regular or reliable attendance at work.\n[42] In a subsequent letter from Respondent counsel to the Commission, it was clarified that at the time of the dismissal, the Respondent considered the Complainant fit to return to full and regular duties as a bus operator. However, the Respondent did not accept that the medical report from Dr. Sequeira and Dr. Erickson dated January 31, 1996, provided any prognosis of regular attendance in respect of the performance of these duties, and the Complainant was consequently dismissed.\n[43] Two former managers at OC Transpo, Mr. Ron Marcotte and Mr. Gerald Timlin, testified that amongst the factors considered by the Health Unit, when assessing whether an employee has any prognosis of regular attendance, is his or her previous attendance record. Unquestionably, the Complainant's attendance record was poor, but the Commission points out that this came as a result of the Complainant's illnesses, principally PTSD, a mental disability falling within the definition of disability as set out in s. 25 of the Act.\n[44] Thus, it is argued, all of the elements of the prima facie case have been made out. The Complainant, who suffered from a disability, was dismissed from his employment by the Respondent, at least in part, because of his record of absenteeism. The primary cause of the absenteeism was his disability. Therefore, one of the factors in the Respondent's decision to dismiss the Complainant was his disability, which constitutes one of the proscribed grounds of discrimination under the Act. For a complaint to be substantiated, discrimination need only be one of the factors underlying a respondent's conduct. (7) Accordingly, submits the Commission, the Respondent in the present case is prima facie in breach of the Act.\n[45] The Respondent disagrees, arguing that in order for a prima facie case to be established, it must be demonstrated that the Complainant has actually been discriminated against. It is not sufficient to contend that merely because a disabled person has been dismissed, discrimination has taken place. It must be shown that the individual was dismissed because of the disability. The Respondent points out that it did not disagree with the opinion of the medical experts to the effect that the Complainant was able to return to work as a bus operator. Counsel for the Respondent reiterated, in his final submissions, the position that he had adopted in his pre-hearing correspondence with the Commission: that is, when the Complainant was dismissed in February 1996, the Respondent considered him fit to return to full and regular duties as a bus operator. The Respondent argues that the decision to dismiss the Complainant, therefore, was not based on any assumption that he was disabled. In the absence of this element, the Commission cannot claim that the Complainant was subject to discriminatory treatment on the basis of a disability. The Complainant was simply let go because of the poor prognosis of his regular and reliable attendance, not his ability to perform the work whenever he would attend. The Respondent's treatment of the Complainant, pursuant to its policy on innocent absenteeism, was no different than that afforded any worker, whether disabled or not, who failed to have a good attendance record and whose predicted attendance in the future was equally unsatisfactory.\n[46] I find that the facts do not support this argument. The Respondent's decision to dismiss the Complainant was clearly influenced by the Complainant's medical condition, as appears from the evidence of Mr. Timlin, who was then Director of Occupational Health, Safety and Benefits at OC Transpo. He participated in the management process that led to the decision to dismiss the Complainant. Mr. Timlin testified that in deciding to fire the Complainant, OC Transpo relied heavily on the opinion of its Health Unit. The memo that the Health Unit sent to management regarding the Complainant's prognosis could not have been any more clear, stating that its finding took into consideration the medical information on file and the Complainant's past record of attendance. The Respondent cannot now suggest that the Complainant's medical condition was not at least one of the factors that lead to its conclusion to dismiss him. As I indicated earlier, it is not necessary for a proscribed ground to be the only factor underlying a respondent's conduct for there to be a finding of discrimination. I would also add that Mr. Timlin testified that OC Transpo's decision to terminate the Complainant was not influenced at all by the other consideration stated in the Health Unit's memo, that of his lacking a Class C driver's licence. Mr. Timlin explained that the Respondent regularly assists employees, whose permits have been downgraded while on leave, to reacquire the required certification.\n[47] As an indication that the decision to dismiss the Complainant was not influenced by his medical condition, the Respondent refers to the Complainant's poor overall attendance record, dating back to the 1970's, and well before his affliction with PTSD. It is therefore suggested that the Complainant was simply someone who could not maintain regular and reliable attendance. An employer that suffers the consequences of an employee's failure to fulfill his work obligations should be justified at some point to consider the employment contract as having come to an end. But this argument does not truly reflect the facts of this case either. As I have already stated, the Health Unit's memo, upon which the Respondent's decision to dismiss was based, unquestionably concerned the Complainant's medical condition. Furthermore, although some of the Complainant's absences were not related to PTSD, the largest portion of them was, and, moreover, I accept the evidence of the Commission's experts that some of his other illnesses may have been related to the PTSD. In any event, even if the absenteeism prior to the PTSD was the only factor in his dismissal, why was the Complainant not dismissed before the onset of the disability? It is noteworthy that in the period leading up to his dismissal, the Complainant's longest continuous absence from work occurred while he was recovering from PTSD and other illnesses that may be related to this disorder.\n[48] I do not accept the Respondent's further submission that the treatment of the Complainant should only be compared to that of other OC Transpo employees with poor non-culpable absenteeism records. The Complainant's attendance record was inextricably linked to his disability. The Respondent concedes that as of the date of the Complainant's dismissal, he was considered fit to return to work. Yet the employer expected him to produce medical or other evidence to demonstrate that he would be able to maintain regular and reliable attendance in the long term, defined by Mr. Timlin to mean as many as twenty years into the future. Other OC Transpo employees who were healthier than the Complainant were able to maintain good attendance records in the past because they lacked his distinguishing characteristic, a disability. It was not suggested that those employees were expected to provide evidence demonstrating a 20-year prognosis of regular and reliable attendance. In this sense, the Complainant, a person who had suffered from a disability, was treated differently than employees who were not disabled.\n[49] I find that the Respondent's prediction that the Complainant's attendance in the future would be poor was based on the likelihood that he would suffer some form of relapse. When Mr. Mooney, the Superintendent of Operational Personnel, sought the Health Unit's opinion prior to dismissing the Complainant, he was interested in knowing whether the Complainant's condition, at that time, was any different from that for which there had been a prognosis of regular attendance, in 1994, after the Complainant's recovery from the sleep disorder. According to Mr. Timlin's testimony, the employer was in effect seeking some additional guarantee that the Complainant's attendance would improve.\n[50] I am convinced that underlying the Respondent's decision to dismiss the Complainant was an assumption that he would likely suffer from some sort of recurrence of prior illnesses, which would in turn result in additional absences from work. Conduct that is based on an actual or perceived possibility that an individual may develop a disability in the future constitutes discrimination on the basis of disability, according to the Supreme Court of Canada, in Quebec (C.D.P.D.J.) v. Montreal (City) (Montreal). (8) Although that case dealt with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms,(9) which prohibits discrimination based on a person's handicap, as opposed to his disability, the Court stressed that the objectives of human rights statutes throughout Canada do not vary because of such differences in terminology. (10)\n[51] The Respondent argues that its motive at all times was to manage the attendance within its workforce. Labour relations law recognizes the right of an employer to dismiss an employee due to excessive innocent absenteeism, provided the employer satisfies the test of demonstrating that the employee has a record of undue absenteeism in the past and that he or she is incapable of regular attendance in the future.(11) However, any discussion relating to the Respondent's motives is irrelevant to the issue before this Tribunal. It is trite law that an intention to discriminate is not a necessary element to proving discrimination under Canadian human rights legislation. (12) If the application of a labour relations policy has as an unintended effect, the adverse differential treatment of an individual based on a proscribed ground of discrimination, there may still be a finding of discrimination against the employer who is implementing the policy.\n[52] The Respondent is concerned that if this approach is followed, the logical outcome will be that an employer will never be permitted to dismiss an employee whose level of disability-related absenteeism is unacceptably high. In effect, the employer will be compelled to keep an employee who is unable to fulfill his end of the employment bargain, that is, the performance of his work. Counsel for the Respondent directed me to the labour arbitration decision in Re: Air B.C. Ltd. and Canadian Airline Dispatchers Assn., (13) wherein the arbitrator rejected such a suggestion and noted that the existence of human rights legislation does not result in the eradication of the labour relations doctrine of non-culpable absenteeism.\n[53] The conclusions of the labour arbitrator in that case, though, serve to demonstrate that the Respondent's concerns are, in fact, unwarranted. As is pointed out in the decision, there are two issues to be considered in such cases: first, did the employer meet the tests set out in labour relations jurisprudence to establish a case of non-culpable absenteeism, and then, second, whether the employer's conduct contravenes the applicable human rights legislation. This latter issue is resolved by conducting a BFOR analysis, the approach for which was most recently set out in Meiorin. It is the third step of the Meiorin test that maintains an employer's right to dismiss an employee in such cases, provided the employer demonstrates that it cannot accommodate the employee without imposing undue hardship on itself. Where an employer is able to establish these elements, its decision to dismiss an employee due to his or her non-culpable absenteeism will be justified.\n[54] When measured against the labour relations test, there is no doubt that the Complainant's record of innocent absenteeism was very high. There is some issue as to what the prognosis for regular attendance was. The medical experts' letter of January 31, 1996 stated that his prognosis was very good, yet in their respective testimonies, they were both forthright in their explanations that this prediction was limited to the short term. It would have been irresponsible of them to have attempted to foretell the state of the Complainant's health to any greater extent. Counsel for the Respondent suggests that I am in some way bound by the findings of fact of the labour arbitrator who, in his ruling regarding the Complainant's grievance, stated that the prognosis for his regular attendance was indeed poor. However, I do not see the necessity to follow this course, considering that the medical evidence of the Commission's experts does not contradict the position of the Respondent that at the time of the dismissal, the prognosis beyond the short term was at the very least uncertain.\n[55] The point to be made here is that even if the Respondent was correct in its assessment of the Complainant's condition and its decision satisfied the non-culpable absenteeism test formulated in labour relations law jurisprudence, the matter before this human rights tribunal remains undecided. One must still proceed through the BFOR analysis articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Meiorin.\n[56] To summarize on this point, I find that a prima facie case of discrimination has been established. The decision by the Respondent to dismiss the Complainant, in furtherance of its program to manage and improve attendance within its workforce, was based, at least in part, on the Complainant's disability. It is therefore now incumbent upon the Respondent to demonstrate that its decision was based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\nC. Meiorin Test (i) Steps 1 & 2 [57] The first element of the Meiorin test requires the employer to demonstrate that the standard in issue was adopted for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job. A document describing OC Transpo's Attendance Management Program was entered into evidence. Mr. Marcotte testified that the principles set out therein reflect the policy that was in place when the Complainant was dismissed in 1996, although the document itself may have been drafted some months thereafter. According to this text, the stated purpose of the Attendance Management Program was as follows:\n[...] to reduce the high cost of absenteeism in a way that is consistent and fair to all employees. Employees have an obligation to maintain regular attendance; OC Transpo has a responsibility to; [sic] create working conditions conducive to good attendance, monitor attendance, and to work with employees who are experiencing extraordinary levels of absenteeism.\nAs the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal concluded in Eyerley v. Seaspan International Ltd.,(14) there is an obvious rational connection between a rule designed to maintain reasonable levels of attendance on the job and the requirements of that job. In any event, the Commission did not argue that Step 1 was not satisfied in the present case.\n[58] It is similarly not in dispute that the Respondent adopted the Attendance Management Program in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary for the fulfilment of this stated purpose.\n(ii) Step 3 [59] In order for the Respondent to show that its program regarding innocent absenteeism was reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of its stated purpose of maintaining reasonable levels of attendance, it must be demonstrated that it was impossible to accommodate the Complainant or other employees sharing his characteristics, without imposing undue hardship upon the Respondent. When the Act was amended in 1998, Section 15(2) was added to provide that health, safety and cost are the factors to be considered in determining whether accommodating a person's needs would impose undue hardship on an employer. However, the facts giving rise to the present complaint occurred prior to the passage of this amendment, and, as was pointed out in Desormeaux v. Ottawa Carleton Regional Transit Commission (15), my consideration of the accommodation issue is therefore governed by the principles articulated by the Supreme Court in Central Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) (16) and several subsequent cases. Some of these principles have been summarized in Eyerley:(17)\nIn Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud (18), Sopinka, J. noted that undue implies that some hardship is acceptable; it is only undue hardship that satisfies this test. In Central Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) (19), other relevant factors considered by the Supreme Court include, financial cost, interchangeability of the workforce and facilities, the provisions of the collective agreement, substantial interference with the rights and morale of other employees, and employee safety. Excessive cost may justify a refusal to accommodate those with disabilities, but there must not be too low a value put on accommodating disability. Otherwise it would be too easy to use increased cost as a reason for refusing to accord the disabled equal treatment (20). The provisions of a collective agreement cannot absolve the employer of its duty to accommodate, although substantial departure from its terms is a factor to be considered for undue hardship. (21)\n[61] The Respondent contends that in cases involving innocent absenteeism releases, the accommodation aspect of the analysis may not be necessary. When assessing an employee's prognosis for regular and reliable attendance, an employer implicitly takes into consideration whether that employee could be accommodated to the point of undue hardship. As Counsel for the Respondent noted, there is nothing incompatible with innocent absenteeism releases and human rights considerations flowing through each other. In such cases, therefore, there no longer remains any need to proceed through the third step in the Meiorin analysis.\n[62] I respectfully disagree. As the arbitral decision in Air B.C. illustrates, there are two stages involved in reviewing innocent absenteeism dismissals. The first is conducted in accordance with labour relations law and the second in accordance with human rights law. I fail to see how one can assume that once an employer properly concludes that an employee's prognosis for attendance is poor, the employer's duty to accommodate under human rights law is satisfied. A review of the labour arbitration ruling regarding the Complainant's grievance supports this point. OC Transpo's decision to dismiss the Complainant was held to be just, even though the arbitrator did not examine whether the employer had accommodated the employee to the point of undue hardship, in accordance with the human rights principles referred to above. The Arbitrator's comments on the issue were limited to a blanket statement that the Complainant had been amply accommodated in the past to no avail and that therefore, it was not a case where the employer has failed to accommodate a disability. The notion of undue hardship was never even discussed.\n[63] The Respondent goes on, however, to provide a second reason for not proceeding through an accommodation analysis. Based on the medical opinion of Drs. Sequeira and Erickson, OC Transpo viewed the Complainant as being fit to work as a bus operator at the time of his dismissal. Consequently, there remained no disability for the employer to accommodate. Having come to the conclusion that the Complainant's prognosis for regular and reliable attendance in the long term was poor, the only possible form of accommodation would have been for OC Transpo to tolerate the Complainant's predicted high level of absenteeism. This, argues the Respondent, is not an acceptable form of accommodation.\n[64] Counsel for the Respondent directed me to the 1992 case of the Ontario Board of Inquiry in Bonner v. Ontario (Minister of Health), (22) which related to a complainant who suffered from periodic bouts of depression. The Board mentioned in its ruling that a person who by reason of handicap cannot work competently on a regular basis is incapable of satisfying the requirements of the position regardless of how he or she might perform when unaffected by that handicap.(23) The Board went on to reject the premise that someone with such a disability should be accommodated in the sense of being tolerated.\n[65] I find this decision of limited relevance to the present case. First of all, these references constitute obiter dicta, as the principal finding of the Board was that the complainant in that case would not have performed satisfactorily, irrespective of his handicap. Furthermore, the Board did not consider differential treatment of someone who may possibly develop a disability in the future, as being a form of discrimination. This finding is incompatible with the subsequent judgment of the Supreme Court in the Montreal case. Overall, the Board took a narrow view regarding accommodation and undue hardship. The Board asserted that the principle of undue hardship does not require an employer to hire or retain employees who, because of a handicap, are always or occasionally incapable of doing the work, simply because the employer has the resources to tolerate actually deficient work.(24) The law has moved well beyond such an interpretation, as evidenced by the statement of the Supreme Court of Canada, in Meiorin, that the employer bears the burden, under the third step of the analysis, of demonstrating that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the complainant without imposing undue hardship on the employer. (25)\n[66] Besides, I fail to see how tolerating absenteeism cannot constitute an acceptable type of accommodation. Certainly, all employers must be prepared to accept some level of absenteeism from all employees as it is inevitable that they will be unable to attend their work, from time to time. The issue to be decided is whether this tolerance of a certain level of absenteeism would impose undue hardship on the employer, taking into consideration all the appropriate factors. In the recent Alberta Court of Queen's Bench case of UNA v. Calgary Health Authority,(26) one of the issues to be decided was whether the employer is obliged to hire a qualified woman who is pregnant, for a term position, if it is known from the outset that she cannot complete the entire term due to the impending birth of her child. The Court found that it would be erroneous to assume that accommodating this sort of availability issue would inevitably result in undue hardship. The Court saw no distinction between the duty to accommodate such absenteeism from the duty in cases such as Central Alberta Dairy Pool and Simpsons-Sears, (27) where the employers were obliged to accommodate employees who would be absent on a regular basis, to the point of undue hardship. I do not, therefore, accept the Respondent's suggestion that the third step in the Meiorin analysis has no application in this case.\n[67] One of the reasons why the Respondent considered that the only form of accommodation available would be to tolerate absenteeism was because it assumed that the Complainant could only and would only work as a bus operator. Yet, the evidence shows otherwise. To begin with, the Health Unit memo, which OC Transpo management relied upon in deciding to terminate the Complainant's employment, suggested in its second paragraph that the Health Unit was willing to contact his medical advisors regarding alternate employment, if his employing division was able and prepared to offer the Complainant such employment. The Health Unit, therefore, had not rejected the possibility of his being able to perform satisfactorily in another job.\n[68] In addition, the Complainant testified that when he was told that he would not be allowed to return to his job, he asked Mr. Mooney to let him take on some other duties within OC Transpo. Mr. Mooney refused and informed him that no form of rehabilitation would be provided. I found the Complainant's entire testimony forthright and credible and no evidence was led to contradict his recollection of this conversation. Even if the OC Transpo managers who decided to dismiss the Complainant (including Mr. Mooney and Mr. Timlin) thought that the only employment option available in his case was to keep him as a bus operator, the information before them clearly suggested that other options should have been examined.\n[69] This raises another important failure on the part of the Respondent in dealing with the Complainant. In Meiorin, the Court alluded to the practical usefulness, in conducting the accommodation analysis, of considering separately:\nthe appropriateness of the procedure that the employer adopted to assess the issue of accommodation, and the substantive content of the accommodating standard that was offered to the employee, if any.(28)\nThe Commission submits that, with respect to the Complainant's disability, the Respondent failed to even observe the policies outlined in its own Attendance Management Program, and, as such, neglected to accommodate him procedurally. For instance, the Attendance Management Program provided that all reasonable efforts must be taken to try to rehabilitate or accommodate an employee who is found to be innocently absent from work because of a disability, if this can be done without undue hardship. These accommodation mechanisms included the options offered by the DERC, such as the shuttle bus to which the Complainant had been assigned in 1992.\n[70] The Attendance Management Program goes on to declare that an employee can only be medically terminated once every reasonable effort has been made to accommodate the employee within the work place. The Commission argues that the Complainant was terminated before any such effort was made. Indeed, I find that the Respondent, on whom rests the burden to demonstrate that the employee could not be accommodated, did not present evidence that any such attempts were made. To the contrary, it appears that the Respondent, having concluded that the Complainant was already fit, proceeded with the dismissal without considering any other options. Yet, as I have already explained, OC Transpo's decision was tainted with an assumption that the Complainant would not be able to regularly attend work, on account of a possible occurrence of illness in the future.\n[71] There was some suggestion in the medical experts' letter of a process of work hardening that would assist in the Complainant's readjustment. In addition, the Complainant's past experience demonstrated that his recoveries were undermined when confronted with stressful situations, such as driving on routes on which he had been attacked in the past. Ensuring that the Complainant avoided such circumstances may have assisted in preventing any recurrence of his disabilities. The Respondent argues that the Complainant's medical advisors never suggested that he needed to do another job, but that he was ready to return to his duties as a bus driver. I do not find this argument convincing. There is no evidence that any question about alternate employment was ever asked of the experts. Dr. Sequeira and Dr. Erickson certainly were prepared, as indicated in their January 31, 1996 letter, to be consulted by the employer regarding the assignment of duties, presumably as a bus driver. Considering the Respondent's concern that the Complainant would be unable to maintain regular attendance as a bus operator, nothing prevented the Respondent, at this point, from requesting that the Complainant's experts provide their opinion regarding alternate employment. There is no evidence that any such request was made.\n[72] Do employers have the obligation to make such an enquiry? The Respondent suggests not, citing as authority for its position the recent judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Oak Bay Marina Ltd. (c.o.b. Painter's Lodge) v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission) (Oak Bay).(29) The Court found that the employer in that case was entitled to rely on its own experience with the complainant in assessing his ability to perform the job, and was not required to investigate any further into his mental disability by, for instance, obtaining additional expert opinions. However, the findings in this decision are clearly fact-specific. The job in question was that of a guide working on small fishing boats travelling over what were described as among the deadliest waters in British Columbia. The lives of the employer's clients rested in the hands of the guide and it is evident that the Court believed that in the interests of their safety, the employer was entitled to rely on its own empirical knowledge regarding the complainant's capacity to function under these circumstances. In the present case, the Respondent does not question the Complainant's ability to perform his duties well, when he is working. The issue for the Respondent is the Complainant's level of absenteeism.\n[73] The Court also suggested that the scope of the duty to investigate could vary depending on the nature and size of the employer. The Court distinguished the small business of the employer in that case from, as an example, the operations of a government with entire departments and volumes of information available to it.(30) OC Transpo certainly is more reflective of the latter example. Finally, regarding this question of the duty to investigate, I am guided yet again by the findings in Meiorin. The Court identifies some of the important questions to be asked in the course of the Step 3 analysis, including whether the employer investigated alternative approaches that do not have a discriminatory effect. Implicit in this finding is the duty upon an employer to conduct such an investigation. Without question, there also exists a duty upon the employee to cooperate with the employer in such a process but, as I discussed earlier, I am convinced that the Complainant and his medical advisors were willing and prepared to cooperate in finding a way to rehabilitate him and assure his full reintegration back into the OC Transpo workforce.\n[74] Assuming the only available accommodation, as suggested by the Respondent, was to tolerate the Complainant's absenteeism in the future, what evidence was presented to demonstrate that this would impose undue hardship on the employer?\n[75] The work schedule for bus operators was typically established on the basis of four or five booking periods per year. In advance of each period, drivers were permitted to select their routes and dates of work, based on their seniority. One of the options available to them was to work on the spare board. The spare board consisted of a number of drivers (the evidence suggests between 30 and 50 persons) who were available to replace absent workers, as the need arose. These absences were typically unexpected in nature, such as when an operator overslept, was snowed in or fell sick. Spare board drivers received their full salary, whether they were assigned to replace another operator or not.\n[76] In the event that the number of absentees exceeded the number of drivers on the spare board, OC Transpo was obliged to ask other drivers to fill in, who were then paid on an overtime basis. On occasion, enough overtime operators could not be found, in which case buses did not go out and service to the public was affected. Dissatisfied transit users were known to complain about service interruptions to their local politicians who in turn conveyed these concerns to the OC Transpo management.\n[77] Mr. Marcotte has served as Manager of Staff Relations and Employee Relations at OC Transpo. He testified as to the complexity associated with attempting to predict how many individuals would be absent on a given day and accordingly, estimating the number of operators to put on the spare board.\n[78] In the case of longer term absences, where it was known in advance of a booking period that an employee would be unavailable for the entire term, the operator was not permitted to book any shifts. It is my understanding, based on the somewhat sketchy evidence on this issue, that because such absentees had no scheduled shifts, they were not replaced with drivers on the spare board. On the other hand, if it was uncertain whether the duration of the absence would cover an entire booking period, the employee was permitted to book work dates. If he or she was ultimately unable to come in on those days, a spare board driver would have to fill in.\n[79] To summarize, the hardship that the Complainant's potential future absenteeism may have imposed is the following:\n\u00b7 a spare driver, who would receive a salary whether the driver was assigned to a bus route or not, would have to replace him;\n\u00b7 between 30 and 50 drivers were assigned to the spare board on any given day. If an insufficient number of spare drivers were available, another operator would have to be paid overtime wages to fill in;\n\u00b7 if an overtime employee could not be found, the bus service on that run would be interrupted;\n\u00b7 affected transit users could complain to their local politicians who would pass on the complaints to OC Transpo management.\n[80] I do not find that this evidence demonstrates that accommodating the Complainant's possible absenteeism would impose undue hardship on the Respondent.\n[81] To begin with, this evidence, introduced through the testimonies of Mr. Timlin and Mr. Marcotte, was basically anecdotal in nature. Mr. Timlin prefaced some of his comments with a warning that his expertise related to the payment of employee benefits, not the work scheduling process. Neither he nor Mr. Marcotte provided any details whatsoever as to the actual financial cost of running the spare board or paying the overtime wages when the spare board was depleted, particularly in comparison to OC Transpo's overall expenditures. No evidence was led as to how frequently the spare board was depleted nor how often transit service to the public was interrupted due to absenteeism.\n[82] The Complainant had received disability benefits during many of his absences. No evidence was led by the Respondent to indicate the related costs, if any, and the level of hardship to the Respondent arising therefrom.\n[83] Mr. Marcotte confirmed that a bus operator's absence did not put anyone's health at risk. He also acknowledged that it would be a stretch to contend that excess overtime imposed so much stress on the replacing employees that safety concerns were raised. In fact, the Respondent did not demonstrate what hardship would be imposed on the workforce at large. Most of the alleged hardship relates to the spare board process. Yet the evidence regarding the Complainant shows that during many of these absences, especially while he was being treated for PTSD, he was placed on long-term disability leave. Thus, over a period of nine months in 1992 and for the last eleven months leading up to his dismissal, the Complainant had not booked any shifts. Spare board employees should therefore not have been called upon to replace him in these periods. If the Complainant was likely to be innocently absent in the future, as the Respondent had predicted, it is certainly possible that these absences would have resembled the past incidents and resulted in his being disabled over a long term. The spare board would consequently have been unaffected.\n[84] Respondent counsel referred me to the recent judgment of the Ontario Divisional Court in Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Roosma, (31) which affirmed a decision of the Ontario Board of Inquiry. The case concerned two employees at the Ford automobile plant in Oakville who for religious reasons could not work from sunset on Friday until sunset on Saturday. They sought to be permanently excused from working Friday evenings. The Ontario Human Rights Commission led evidence that the cost to Ford of replacing the employees on those shifts was negligible. The Board of Inquiry disagreed with this assessment by extending the notion of cost to include the real cost of resulting declines in both quality and production, which while difficult to measure were nonetheless deemed real. The Board concluded that accommodating these employees, by arranging for the swapping of shifts or the hiring of part-time or student workers, would impose undue hardship on Ford.\n[85] The circumstances regarding the Roosma case differ significantly from those of the present case. First of all, the Court did not necessarily adopt the reasons of the Board of Inquiry; it simply concluded that the board's findings met the reasonableness standard of judicial review. The Court noted that the Board was presented with extensive detailed and uncontradicted evidence from Ford, regarding the consequences of accommodating the complainants. Moreover, amongst the factors that influenced the Board's findings was not only the financial cost to Ford but also the interchangeability of its operations, the importance of having the regular operator on each job, the impact of the collective agreement, safety considerations and the substantial effect of accommodation on other workers. (32) [86] As I have already indicated, I have no evidence before me of the actual financial cost regarding the Respondent's measures for accommodating or tolerating absenteeism. Safety issues do not arise and evidence was not introduced regarding the impact of the collective agreement. Aside from the mention of the possible, though unlikely, additional stress on overtime employees, I was not provided with any insight as to how accommodating the Complainant's potential future absenteeism would affect other employees. In addition, contrary to the evidence raised in Roosma with respect to Ford's automobile assembly line workers, the evidence before me suggests that the functions of a bus operator are highly interchangeable. I thus find that Roosma can be distinguished from the present case.\n[87] The Respondent has failed to establish that accommodating the potential innocent absenteeism of the Complainant after his return to work in February 1996 would have imposed undue hardship on OC Transpo.\n[88] The complaint is therefore substantiated.\nIII. REMEDY A. Reinstatement [89] In human rights cases, where a complaint of discrimination is found to be substantiated, it is the duty of the Tribunal to attempt to restore a complainant to the position that he or she would have been in, but for the discrimination. (33) The Commission accordingly submits that the Complainant should be reinstated to the position of bus operator or such other suitable occupation as the Tribunal may determine.\n[90] Respondent counsel argued that reinstatement is inappropriate in the present circumstances. In the seven years since his dismissal, the prognosis for the Complainant's attendance has remained unchanged. Once he is reinstated, and provided the employer's predictions hold true, the parties will again find themselves in the difficult situation of having to deal with the Complainant's excessive absenteeism. This argument appears to me to be predicated on an assumption that is itself related to the Complainant's disability. I have already held that such an assumption is discriminatory and it can therefore play no role in the fashioning of the remedy.\n[91] I am satisfied that the appropriate remedy would be for the Complainant to be reinstated as a bus operator. I therefore order the Respondent to reinstate the Complainant to the position of bus operator, together with the commensurate seniority and benefits of a full-time permanent employee, the whole with retroactive effect to the date of his dismissal.\n[92] According to the evidence, the Respondent ordinarily assists employees returning from extended leave in their reintegration into the workforce. This assistance includes the provision of training as well as aid in the reacquisition of any necessary driving permits from the appropriate authorities. The Respondent must provide this assistance to the Complainant.\nB. Damages for Lost Income [93] The Respondent is ordered to pay to the Complainant damages for his lost wages from February 2, 1996, until the date of his return to full time employment, taking into account other income, statutory deductions and gross-up for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. All of his benefits should also be adjusted accordingly.\n[94] I do not accept the Respondent's suggestion that the damages for lost wages should only run from the date of the labour arbitrator's decision that the Complainant was justly terminated. The Respondent's liability flows from its decision to end the Complainant's employment, based in part on a discriminatory ground, irrespective of whether the labour arbitrator deemed the dismissal just.\n[95] Instead of presenting evidence or submissions at the hearing with respect to the calculation of these damages, the parties agreed to work together to determine these amounts. As I explain below, I will retain jurisdiction in case these discussions do not prove fruitful.\nC. Hurt Feelings [96] The facts giving rise to the complaint precede the 1998 amendments to the Act. Section 53(3) stated, at that time, that the Tribunal could order a respondent to pay up to $5,000 in compensation to a victim of discrimination who had suffered in respect of feelings or self-respect. I am in agreement with the findings of the Tribunal, in Premakumar v. Air Canada (34) and Desormeaux (35), that the $5,000 maximum award must be reserved for the very worst cases that fall within the range of cases in which such awards are warranted.\n[97] The Complainant testified as to the effect that the termination had on his life. He felt a loss of dignity and feared for his family's economic well-being. The financial impact was so great that it became difficult for him to purchase appropriate food for his family. The evidence does suggest, though, the dismissal did not lead to a recurrence of PTSD and that to the contrary, Dr. Erickson having noted that the Complainant was taking it extremely well\".\n[98] Taking into account these and all of the other circumstances in this case, I order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant the sum of $3,500 as special compensation.\nD. Policy Review [99] The Commission seeks an order that the Respondent's policy regarding the accommodation of employees with disabilities be reviewed and revised. Over seven years have passed since the Complainant was dismissed. The evidence is that since that time, the employer has changed (to the City of Ottawa) and the accommodation policies and attendance management programs have gone through several modifications and updates. The newest attendance management program that is now being implemented extends to all the employees of the City of Ottawa, not just those working within OC Transpo. Furthermore, the liability in the present case stems in part from the Respondent's failure to apply the program that was in place at the time of the Complainant's dismissal, and was not necessarily the result of a particular defect in the program itself. The Commission's request is consequently denied.\nE. Interest [100] Interest is payable regarding all of the monetary awards made pursuant to this decision. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly Series) set by the Bank of Canada. With respect to compensation for hurt feelings, the interest shall accrue from the date of dismissal until the final payment of the award. Interest on the lost wages shall also run from the date of dismissal until the final payment of the award, but shall be calculated as the wages would have become payable to the Complainant.\nF. Retention of Jurisdiction [102] In the event that any difficulties arise in the implementation of these remedies, including a failure by the parties to reach an agreement regarding the damages for lost wages, I retain jurisdiction to receive evidence, hear further submissions and make further orders.\n\"Original signed by\"\nAthanasios D.

(TNA), alleging that the company failed to provide her with a harassment-free workplace, in breach of its obligations under the Canadian Human Rights Act. She also alleges that her employer treated her in an adverse differential fashion and terminated her employment because of her pregnancy. Ms. Hodgins subsequently filed additional complaints against the former owners of the company, Ken and Karen Dragosists, alleging that both Mr. and Ms. Dragosists sexually harassed her in the course of her employment with TNA.\n[2] In preparation for the hearing of Ms. Hodgins' complaints, the Tribunal Registry sent pre-hearing questionnaires to each of the parties. Neither Mr. Dragosists nor Ms. Dragosists have responded, or given any indication to date that they intend to participate in the hearing. TNA returned its completed questionnaire. At the same time, David Bazar, one of the current owners of TNA, asked that The Commission consider removing TNA as a respondent in this matter since it seems to me that there can be no useful purpose served by TNA being a respondent. Given that the request was sent to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, I understand TNA to be seeking an order from the Tribunal dismissing the complaint against TNA, and have treated Mr. Bazar's correspondence as a motion for such relief.\n[3] TNA's submissions are very brief. Although Mr. Bazar was afforded the opportunity to file more complete submissions in support of the company's request, he elected not to do so. I must therefore address the company's request based upon the limited information before me.\n[4] Mr. Bazar indicates that he and his wife acquired control of Transport North American Express Inc. subsequent to the events described in Ms. Hodgins' complaint. As a consequence, neither Mr. Bazar nor his wife have any knowledge of the facts surrounding Ms. Hodgins' allegations. According to Mr. Bazar, the assets of TNA were seized last July, following a demand for repayment by the Bank of Montreal, which was evidently a secured creditor of the company. Mr. Bazar states that TNA's assets were subsequently sold by a Trustee. The company currently has no assets or employees, and is no longer generating any revenue.\n[5] The Commission's submissions are predicated upon the assumption that TNA has gone through formal bankruptcy proceedings. Mr. Bazar does not, however, assert that TNA was ever in bankruptcy. As a result, I do not need to consider the effects that such a bankruptcy might have had on these proceedings. It may well be that the Trustee referred to in Mr. Bazar's correspondence was appointed under the Bank's security agreement, for the purposes of realizing on the Bank's security.\n[6] TNA was Ms. Hodgins' employer. Section 65 (1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act makes employers liable for harassment in the workplace, where the harassment involves one or more of the proscribed grounds enumerated in Section 3 of the Act, unless the employer can satisfy the elements of the due diligence defense described in Section 65 (2) of the Act. The fact that control of TNA may have changed in the period between Ms. Hodgins' departure from the company and the present time does not, by itself, operate to relieve the company of liability for any discriminatory conduct that might have occurred in the workplace prior to the change in control.\n[7] Mr. Bazar asserts that Mr. and Ms. Dragosists are no longer associated with the company, and that the company is currently in litigation with the Dragosists. As a result, Mr. Bazar says, the company is unable to call any witnesses in its defense. There is no suggestion, however, that the Dragosists are unavailable to testify. It is open to TNA to subpoena the Dragosists if it deems their testimony to be necessary for its defense.\n[8] Accordingly, TNA's motion for dismissal of the complaint against the company is dismissed. Given the limited information provided to the Tribunal regarding the circumstances surrounding the change in ownership of TNA, however, I am dismissing the motion without prejudice to TNA's right to renew its request at the hearing of this matter, provided that such request is supported by a more complete evidentiary foundation.\n[9] Given Mr. Bazar's assertion that TNA has no assets, and generates no income, Ms. Hodgins and the Commission may wish to consider whether there is any useful purpose to be served in pursuing the complaint against TNA. That is, however, a decision for the Commission and Ms. Hodgins, and not for this Tribunal.\nOriginal signed by\nAnne Mactavish\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMarch 6, 2003\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE NO.: T745\/5002, T746\/5102 and T747\/5202\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Tara Hodgins v.

Introduction [1] At the opening of the hearing, the Respondents asked for an order closing the hearing to the public. In the alternative, they requested a ban on publication. The Complainant opposed both requests. After receiving the submissions of all the parties, I rejected the application to close the hearing and issued a ban on publication. I advised the parties that I would provide written reasons at a later date.\n[2] The matter is governed by section 52(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which gives the Tribunal the authority to:\n52.(1) . . . take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry if the member or panel is satisfied, during the inquiry or as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, that . . .\n(b) there is a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the inquiry such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public;\n(c) there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public;\n(d) there is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered.\nThe Respondents acknowledged that they have the onus of establishing that an order protecting the confidentiality of the inquiry is necessary and that it is a high onus. They have also accepted that such an order should not be granted where there are other means of protecting the parties and the witnesses.\n[3] There are a variety of interests that arise in the application before me. The first set of interests that favours publication seems to lie in the public domain. The common law is based on an independent, impartial and public process. There are also Charter considerations. I was referred to the guarantee of freedom of the press in section 2(b) of the Charter of Rights, which generally requires that the process of adjudication be conducted in public. Section 2(b) may go further, however, since it protects freedom of opinion and expression, which is not possible without access to the information that permits that expression.\n[4] The second set of interests that favours publication lies in the private realm. Section 11 of the Charter, for example, gives an accused in a criminal case a right to a trial in public. There may be a similar right in the human rights process, which gives either the Complainant or the Respondent the right to ask for a public hearing. Section 7 of the Charter might include some right to a public hearing, if it has a bearing on the psychological integrity of the participants. In Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission) [2002] 2 S.C.R. 307, the Supreme Court has held that there is nothing to prevent the operation of section 7 in the human rights process, where the appropriate circumstances exist.\n[5] In the immediate case, most of the concerns on the other side relate to the privacy of the person. It is interesting that section 7 may also arise in this context, since it protects the psychological integrity of the person, which could be undermined by an open process. This is borne out by the wording of section 52(1)(d) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which uses the same language as section 7. I have also been referred to section 8 of the Charter, which has been interpreted in a manner that protects the privacy of the individual person.\n[6] The question of fairness seems to arise on both sides of the issue, since the idea of public hearings seems to have originated in the belief that public proceedings are open to scrutiny and are therefore inherently more fair than proceedings held in camera. The star chamber looms large in our legal history. The Respondents have argued on the other side that a public process, which destroys the reputation of innocent parties, is fundamentally invasive and unfair. They have submitted that a hearing that permits the publication of extravagant and unjustified allegations is unfair, even if it gives all of the parties a full and ample opportunity to present their cases. I think it is apparent that the concept of fairness in section 52(1)(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act goes beyond mere procedural concerns.\nII. The Basic Rule [7] In spite of the wide variety of interests that come into play in the present application, the basic rule seems abundantly clear. Hearings must generally be conducted in public. This is as much a matter of accountability as anything else. The process must not be hidden. I believe this is the right place to begin. The mandate of fact-finding bodies like the Tribunal is to publicly establish what occurred in a given set of circumstances. I think this requires an open process, in which the competing positions are open to public scrutiny.\n[8] This principle holds, whether the allegations are substantiated or not. The public\u2019s right to know is not restricted to the findings of a Tribunal and generally includes the allegations that have been made, however offensive they may be. There are additional concerns in the context of human rights, since one of the purposes of the human rights process is to educate the public. These kinds of considerations apply in all cases and are not limited to cases where a complaint is made out. The educational purposes of the human rights process are still served by public hearings in situations where the complaints do not succeed.\n[9] The question is accordingly whether the circumstances before me are sufficient to justify a departure from the general rule. It is enough, in making such a determination, to consult the criteria set out in section 52(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, while remaining sensitive to any Charter considerations.\nIII. Closing the Hearing [10] I do not see any need to go beyond general principles in dealing with the request to close the hearing. The public has some right to know what happens at hearings. There are many cases that raise offensive allegations and something more is needed, to justify an in camera proceeding. The human rights process should be open to the public in all but the most compelling circumstances. I think the integrity and reputation of the process would be jeopardized if hearings were closed merely because they deal with sensitive personal matters. One of the effects of closing the hearing would be to seal the entire transcript, a course of proceeding that effectively deletes the hearing from the public record. This goes much too far.\n[11] In Bouvier v. M\u00e9tro Express (1992) 17 C.H.R.R. 313, at para. 6, this Tribunal considered a similar application to move in camera, under an earlier and more austere section of the Act, apparently on the basis that it would injure the reputation of the corporate Respondent. The Tribunal refused to close the hearing:\nIn view of how important it is that the judicial process in our society be public, and particularly in the area of human rights where the educational aspect of the process plays a leading role, and in view of the decisions in Attorney General of Nova Scotia v. MacIntyre, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 175 and Edmonton Journal v. Alberta, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, we refused the request by Loomis that the hearing be held in camera.\nI believe that there is a public right of inspection, which gives ordinary citizens the right to attend legal proceedings and observe how the system operates.\n[12] This cannot be done behind closed doors, and it would be a mistake to pretend, in effect, that the hearing has not taken place. If the Respondents are entirely blameless, and beyond reproach, that does not change the fact that these allegations were made. I am not convinced that any blame accrues to the Respondents in airing such a fact before the public, which can be interpreted in a variety of ways. I think we have to rely on the ability of the public to distinguish mere allegations from statements of fact. The Respondents would have the usual civil remedies, if a member of the public was to confuse the two.\n[13] The Complainant has openly expressed her lack of faith in a closed hearing and insisted on her right to confront the Respondents in public. She has also provided written submissions, in which she argues that it would be a mistake to conceal the hearing from the public. I think there is merit in her submissions. The fact that these kinds of allegations are made in the course of the human rights process should not be hidden from the public. This line of reasoning extends beyond the hearing and encompasses the transcript of the proceedings, which should be open to inspection. This serves the societal interest mentioned in section 52, along with the legal and historical purposes of hearings.\n[14] I should make it clear, before dealing with the application for a ban on publication, that I raised the possibility of briefly closing the hearing, if particular allegations met the requirements of section 52(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. I was informed, however, that this was not a practical alternative, given the number of allegations, and would require constant interruptions in the process. It would also require that portions of the transcript be sealed and removed from the public record. I am not comfortable with such a method of proceeding in the present case, and feel that it is preferable to give the public access to the transcript, which would still be subject to any ban on publication. I believe this goes as far as possible, in protecting the privacy interests of the parties and the public\u2019s right to know.\nIV. THE BAN ON PUBLICATION [15] Publication seems to be a separate matter. The Respondent has referred me to Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] S.C.J. No. 104 (QL), which dealt with an order restraining the CBC from broadcasting a television program dealing with the subject matter of a criminal indictment. Although the facts of the case have no real bearing on the case before me, the decision of the majority sets out the general test in such an application. A ban on publication should only be issued if:\nit is necessary to protect the fairness of the trial or hearing; and the salutary effects of the publication ban outweigh the deleterious effects to the free expression of those affected by the ban.\nThe Respondents have argued that this sets the fundamental parameters in any application for a ban on publication.\n[16] The same kinds of concerns arise under section 52(1)(b) and (c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which nevertheless uses somewhat different language. The section states that a confidentiality order may be granted if the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public. The section recognizes that such a need may arise if there is a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the inquiry\u201d, or a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved. Although the same kinds of concerns might arise under subsection (d), I think it is sufficient to focus on these considerations.\n[17] It will be apparent that Dagenais and many other cases deal with the freedom of the press. I do not believe that it would be prudent to comment on this aspect of the matter in the absence of submissions from an interested party, who can advance the necessary arguments on behalf of the press. Since Dagenais is a criminal case, it also focuses on the interests of the accused. This brings in the presumption of innocence, which is guaranteed in section 11 of the Charter. The major decision relied upon by the Respondents in this regard is A. v. C. [1994] B.C.J. No. 488 9 (B.C.S.C.) (QL), which dealt with an action for defamation arising out of extravagant complaints made to the police and the College of Physicians regarding allegations of sexual abuse. The court had ordered that pseudonyms be used. The case was cited before me for the proposition that the presumption of innocence protects parties in civil proceedings.\n[18] I cannot deal with the case at length. At paragraph 23, the B.C. Supreme Court nevertheless adopts the view expressed in Hirt v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia [1985] 3 W.W.R. 350, at p. 364, where McFarlane J.A. says:\nPublic accessibility to the courts and to the records of the courts is needed so that society can be assured that justice has been done. Secrecy raises doubts in the public mind. But reasonable limitations upon the principle that justice must be done in the open have been recognized for many years in free and democratic societies. True justice must have respect for the rights or reputations of innocent persons.\nAlthough the case discusses a number of other issues, this is the essential proposition that was put before me.\n[19] Counsel for Respondents rested most of their submissions on the reputation and innocence of individuals who the Complainant accuses of gross misconduct and lurid sexual improprieties. The Respondents argued that the presumption of innocence that applies in a criminal context applies to unsavoury allegations that have been made in other proceedings. It was brought to my attention, for example, that two of the witnesses were the subject of separate complaints to the Human Rights Commission. These complaints were not pursued by the Commission and were never referred to the Tribunal. It was suggested to me that their witnesses are now being dragged back in to the process, against their will.\n[20] This kind of argument seems more compelling in a case of harassment, where the law of human rights occasionally enters into the area of some of the allegations normally dealt with in the criminal courts. There are allegations of rape and forced sodomy, for example, before me. The real issue seems to be the sexual allegations: it was suggested that these kinds of allegations carry a particular stigma in our society, which attracts the cloak of confidentiality more readily than other allegations. Mr. Houston has stated on the record that horrendous allegations will arise during the course of the examination of witnesses, which may include allegations of child abuse.\n[21] The Complainant may have competing interests. The Tribunal in Bouvier, supra, at paragraph 7, quotes from Madam Justice Wilson in Edmonton Journal v. Alberta, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, at p. 1361, where she recognizes that an open process may serve more personal interests:\nBut in addition to the interest of the public at large in an open court process there may be compelling arguments in its favour related to the interests of litigants generally. Many may feel vindicated by the public airing of the injustices they feel they have suffered alone and without any support in the community. Indeed, this may be the first time that a spouse is able to speak openly about events that have taken place in the privacy of the home. They may welcome the public endorsement for what they have suffered in private ignominy. (p. 1361)\nThe Respondents have essentially argued that this must not be taken too far. A Complainant should not be allowed to publicly punish a Respondent or innocent third parties, when the complaints are not made out. Nor is the hearing a therapeutic process. There is a concern in at least some of the cases with the use of the adjudicative process for improper or collateral purposes.\n[22] The French version of subsection 52(1)(c) would seem to support such an argument. There must be a balancing. I am nevertheless of the view that at least some of the interests outlined by Madam Justice Wilson can be met by allowing the Complainant to make her allegations in public, with or without a ban on publication. Litigants are entitled to their day in court. The comments of Justice Wilson did not prevent the Tribunal in Bouvier from granting a partial ban on publication in far less compelling circumstances than the circumstances before me. The Respondent took the position that this was not a feasible manner of proceeding in the case before me, given the extent of the allegations and the notoriety of the case in the local community. I have already indicated that I would rather issue a ban on publication than repeatedly close the hearing for portions of the testimony.\n[23] There is another aspect to this, however, which requires serious consideration. The Complainant has opposed the application for a confidentiality order. There are nonetheless good reasons, as the Respondents have suggested, to protect her privacy in this matter. The Respondents have taken the position throughout the present process that the Complainant is psychologically ill and suffers from delusions. I have been advised that she will be cross-examined on the minute details of her personal life and psychological history, which raises the most serious privacy concerns. I recognize the position that the Complainant has taken: she has nonetheless objected on a number of occasions to the disclosure of the details of her medical and psychological record. It seems to me that a confidentiality order would offer her some protection in this regard.\n[24] I cannot comment on the merits of the case before me. There is nevertheless no doubt in my mind that many innocent people have suffered enormous personal and public damage as a result of sexual allegations, which our society finds opprobrious. The shame and humiliation that such people suffer should not be underestimated. The system should not victimize them. I believe that the interests of the public and perhaps the Complainant can be protected by reviewing the matter at the end of the hearing, at which time any ban on publication can be lifted. I should note in passing that counsel for the Respondents expressed an additional concern for the language employed by the Complainant in making these allegations, and a concern about less offensive accusations like theft. I do not find these concerns sufficient to justify a ban on publication.\nV. Order [25] I am accordingly prohibiting the publication of any of the evidence or matters that arise in the course of the present hearing. I believe this is in the interests of all of the parties, including the Complainant, and that publication would undermine the fairness of the inquiry and cause undue hardship to the persons involved. In the circumstances of the case, I am satisfied that this outweighs the normal rules in favour of a public hearing.\n[26] I should make it clear that this ban is revocable and can be revisited if other parties wish to address the question, or the circumstances of the hearing warrant it. It does not extend to any of my rulings or the final decision in the case.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groake Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario March 7, 2003\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T627\/1501 and T628\/1601\nStyle of Cause: Amanda Day v.

THE APPLICATION BEFORE ME [1] The following are my reasons on the application of the Respondents for a ruling that the Complainant is not competent to testify in these proceedings. I prefer to phrase this as a question of capacity, and avoid the pejorative associations of the word featured in the caselaw. There is a second question that has arisen in this context, which is whether the Complainant is capable of representing herself. In the circumstances of the case, I do not believe that it would be in the interests of the parties to interrupt the process in order to prepare extensive reasons. I nevertheless feel obliged to issue written reasons before proceeding further.\n[2] Before dealing with the background to the application, I would comment that the second question might seem to require a higher degree of capacity, since a party who is competent to proceed must be capable of participating in the conduct of the process. This would normally appear to present a higher standard than the capacity to give probative evidence, which need only be sufficient to assist the trier of fact. The usual logic of the situation seems to be reversed, however, in the circumstances before me. That is because the Complainant\u2019s primary difficulty, as Ms. Thayer submitted, is in reciting the sexual allegations at the core of the complaint. This is undoubtedly the most difficult aspect of the matter from a legal perspective.\n[3] Although I have focussed more directly on the first question, which relates to the Complainant\u2019s ability to testify, the reality is that there is a general concern for her psychological condition that goes to all aspects of the case. I want to reassure the Complainant that, in my view, the other parties have acted out of respect for the integrity of the process and with a keen concern for the Complainant\u2019s well-being. There is nothing improper in the application: on the contrary, I think it would have been inappropriate to proceed without canvassing these issues. This holds true, whatever my ruling on the application.\nII. GENERAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE [4] I should state at the outset that the present case seems to have a troubled history. There is no escaping the fact that the psychological history of the Complainant is relevant to the present proceedings. The medical record, which has not been independently proven, indicates that she has been committed in the past. There is no point in hiding this fact: it does not necessarily speak to the Complainant\u2019s present circumstances and as far as I am aware, there is no suggestion from counsel that she is incompetent in the larger legal sense. This merely provides the background to the present application and illustrates, along with the rest of the medical and psychological record, that there are reasons for concern.\n[5] Although I am not privy to the events that may have transpired before the hearing, the Complainant has indicated on a number of occasions that the Human Rights Commission and the other parties sought an order declaring her incompetent. I am not exaggerating when I say that she feels that there was something like a conspiracy to have her committed. I do not know the full details of the matter, but there is enough on the Tribunal file to suggest that there are reasons for the Complainant\u2019s suspicions. This is not intended as a criticism: this has been a difficult matter for everyone involved with it, and I merely feel obliged to set out the larger set of circumstances behind the present application.\n[6] The Complainant inevitably feels that any earlier efforts to have her declared incompetent were merely a convenient way of disposing of the present inquiry. It follows that she is extremely suspicious of the present attempt by the other parties to question her capacity to participate in the hearing. She believes that it is beneficial to her psychological well-being to continue and there is at least some medical evidence that supports such a contention. This raises issues that go beyond the scope of my authority, however, and the Complainant\u2019s legal position is that she has a right to proceed. This includes the right to testify and present her account of what occurred. I have warned her that she will be subject to a full and searching cross-examination, which will undoubtedly raise painful memories and prove emotionally difficult. This does not dissuade her.\nIII. BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT APPLICATION [7] There is no question that the application has been properly and responsibly made. The Complainant displayed erratic behaviour in giving her evidence in chief. This consisted of contorted facial expressions, inappropriate pauses, a pronounced shaking of her head, a raising of her arms and the adoption of various postures, all of which presented a departure from the normal presentation of viva voce evidence. I mention these attributes of her testimony because they are not apparent on the face of the record. The Complainant also used expletives, began sobbing, would occasionally raise her voice or adopt a theatrical and mocking tone, and was unable to continue on a number of occasions. The most difficult aspect of her evidence, from the perspective of managing the case, is that she found it difficult, even impossible, to confine herself to the narrative of events that led to the present complaint. She constantly went into other matters, occasionally in a manner that seems strange and even bizarre, to anyone with a developed sense of relevance.\n[8] I accept, as counsel has submitted, that the Complainant\u2019s behaviour deteriorated as she gave evidence and eventually culminated in what I have described on the record as a screaming fit, which happened when she found herself unable to describe one of the alleged incidents of sexual harassment. I think this can best be described as formless screaming: there were no words, as far as I could determine, and to a lay person, at least, the Complainant cried inconsolably, like an infant. The Tribunal officer immediately called for order and I left the hearing room, though it is clear that she fell to the floor, writhing, in the words of counsel and remained there until after the room was cleared. Dr. Kaplan, a psychologist for the Respondents, advised the Tribunal Officer to phone 911, a suggestion that was carried out. This should not be interpreted as a comment on the nature of what occurred, which became a source of controversy between the parties.\n[9] One of the security officers, Ms. Dennis, remained in the hearing room and later testified as to what occurred. Her testimony was measured and careful evidence, and I accept her account of events. The only point that I feel obliged to clarify is that the hearing was not resumed in the absence of the Complainant. This was never a consideration, though the situation might have transpired differently if Ms. Day had been hospitalized. In my view, the matter was handled with the right degree of concern for the well-being of the Complainant and the need to protect the propriety of the process. After the Complainant had recovered, the hearing was briefly resumed, and the Complainant indicated that she wished to continue with her evidence. The other parties understandably requested a recess. The Complainant became visibly angry in response to the submissions of counsel, and I felt it was best to adjourn until the following day, at which time the Respondents brought the present application.\n[10] I want to be fair. There is a sense in which this puts the matter in the worst light. I should make it clear that the Complainant is an intelligent person who often speaks lucidly and has a real appreciation of the nature and purpose of the present proceedings. She has given coherent testimony that would support the complaints. One of the problems is that she is not familiar with the practices in formal legal proceedings, and like many lay people, does not distinguish between a formal and informal venue. As a result, her manner and language is often inappropriate. She is unrepresented, which has added to her difficulties, and often seems overwhelmed by the minutiae of the evidence. Having said that, and made allowances for her lack of familiarity with legal proceedings, her psychological frailty, and her many interruptions, she appears to understand the process and has some rough ability to conduct her case and present evidence. There is no doubt that this has placed enormous demands on the patience of counsel, and myself, but that is another matter, which goes more to the issue of accommodation.\n[11] After the application was made, I entered into a voir dire for the purpose of deciding the question of competence. The Respondents called Dr. Kaplan, a clinical psychologist, who was in attendance during the hearing. Dr. Kaplan was qualified as an expert and expressed serious reservations about proceeding. He was of the opinion that the Complainant suffers from a paranoid personality disorder, which makes her perception of events inherently unreliable. He also testified that, in his view, the Complainant had gone into a psychotic state while testifying. Dr. Kaplan also prepared a written report, which has been entered as an exhibit in the voir dire. Ms. Thayer placed considerable reliance on his view that the Complainant was having psychotic episodes at the time that she was experiencing the alleged sexual harassment. The cases suggest that this is a major consideration, but this goes to the merits of the case, and the evidence is far from clear at this point in time.\n[12] The Complainant called Ms. Dennis in reply, along with two experts, who were duly qualified. Her therapist also appeared at the hearing, though she did not testify. The evidence of Dr. Hunter, a medical doctor with expertise in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, was essentially that Ms. Day\u2019s behaviour was consistent with such a diagnosis. The other expert witness, Dr. Malcolm, a clinical psychologist, adopted much the same position. Dr. Malcolm has treated the Complainant in the past and was consulted by the Complainant prior to the beginning of the proceedings. Mr. Houston objected vigorously to the fact that Dr. Hunter and Dr. Malcolm believed that it would be an injustice to deprive the Complainant of her right to proceed. These opinions were well intentioned and reflected their view that it would be better for the Complainant to proceed, psychologically. The question of justice is entirely within the keeping of the Tribunal, however, and well outside the scope of expert evidence.\n[13] The Respondents also attacked the reliability of the testimony of Dr. Hunter and Dr. Malcolm, on the basis that they were poorly apprised of the circumstances before me. They also argued, understandably, that Dr. Kaplan was in a better position to provide an informed opinion as to the Complainant\u2019s behaviour on the witness stand. I think there is some merit to these submissions, which may affect the weight of the testimony but does not negate it. I think it is important, in this context, to appreciate that the Respondents have the burden of satisfying me that the Complainant is incapable of testifying. There is no obligation on the Complainant to prove any positive assertion of fact. The evidence that she called on the voir dire was only called to offset the evidence of the Respondents and the experts were not tendered to prove her competence.\n[14] I am left with a disagreement between the experts as to the exact nature of the situation that confronts me. I do not propose to enter into the details of this disagreement, though there was a more specific dispute as to what occurred when she began screaming. Dr. Kaplan was of the view that the Complainant was rapidly decompensating. This terminology was the subject of some discussion. The experts on the other side were more inclined to believe that she had experienced a flashback or abreaction, in which she was reliving the traumatic events in question. There was also a suggestion that she was dissociating. I do not propose to settle the dispute: whatever view is adopted, it is evident that the Complainant was not functioning rationally for the duration of the episode.\n[15] I cannot make a medical or psychological diagnosis, but there are many reasons to believe that she suffers from paranoia in some general sense. I was advised by Dr. Hunter and Dr. Malcolm that this could be a manifestation of the hypervigilance associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I accept that that she is liable to dissociate on the witness stand and may be in danger of losing contact with reality. She does not trust counsel, has difficulty restraining her emotions, and often loses her way on the witness stand. Some of this must be attributed to the fact that the allegations before me are extremely personal and would be difficult for any litigant. Dr. Hunter testified that Ms. Day had an underlying vulnerability that makes them all the more trying for someone in her position. All of this presents a challenge for the conduct of the inquiry.\nIV. THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE APPLICATION [16] The cases hold that it is the business of a judge to decide whether a witness is capable of testifying. It is the business of the jury to weigh the evidence. See: R. Harbuz [1979] 2 W.W.R. 105 and Steinberg v. The King (1931) 56 C.C.C. 9 (S.C.C.). As a result, the question should be dealt with at the earliest possible opportunity, in order to avoid the possibility of a mistrial. These concerns do not arise in the situation before me. The caselaw recognizes, moreover, that the question can be considered at a later point, if concerns arise during the course of a witness\u2019 testimony.\n[17] The law operates on the presumption that a witness has the capacity to testify. This does not require advanced abilities. The same observation can be applied to the question whether a party is capable of conducting its case, which only requires an ability to make basic personal decisions. The Respondents have accepted that they have an obligation to demonstrate, presumably on a balance of probabilities, that the Complainant is incapable of testifying. They rely principally on R. v. Hawke (1975) 7 O.R. (2d) 145 (Ont. C.A.), which is instructive on the general issue. They have also referred me to Sopinka\u2019s Law of Evidence in Canada (2d), at \u00a713.10 et. seq., which provides a very brief account of the law.\n[18] The court in Hawke uses the antique and now unsettling language of Wigmore, at \u00a7i492, in holding that a witness is only disqualified from testifying if the derangement or defect is such as to undermine the witness\u2019 ability to give trustworthy evidence on the specific subject of the testimony. The fact that the Complainant may have a psychological condition or paranoid personality disorder, or may be suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, does not prevent her from testifying. I do not know if a test has been enunciated in the caselaw, but the question is whether a trier of fact can properly and safely consider the evidence, in making a determination of the facts. The use of the word trustworthy is easily misinterpreted and the issue is not whether her testimony should be believed. It is whether it is capable of being believed.\n[19] I feel obliged to add that my primary duty is to protect the integrity of the legal process. Although witnesses may occasionally break down, emotionally, there is a certain level of probity that is necessary to conduct a fair hearing. The legal and evidentiary process calls for a relatively calm and dispassionate assessment of the facts in a given case, and the purpose of the hearing must be respected. I have a fundamental obligation to maintain the level of decorum in the hearing that is necessary to maintain the integrity of the process. This is an indispensable attribute of the legal system and guarantees the justice and fairness of the proceeding.\n[20] The trier of fact must also be able to follow and evaluate the testimony. It must be open to intelligent inspection. The evidence must be presented in some kind of logical and coherent manner, which is capable of rational construction. There may be additional concerns in the immediate case, which relate to the obligation of a tribunal to intervene when the process endangers the psychological well-being of the Complainant. This goes directly to the capacity of the Complainant to present her case, however, and is a secondary concern.\nV. THE COMPLAINANT\u2019S ABILITY TO TESTIFY [21] The parties have come a considerable distance in discharging their burden to establish the Complainant is incapable of testifying. I have real misgivings about continuing, and doubts about whether the Complainant can participate in the hearing in a meaningful and informed manner. I am particularly concerned about whether she can deal with the rigours of cross-examination, which will have to be faced. I have allowed the Complainant considerable latitude in putting in her evidence-in-chief, but the Respondents are entitled to confront her with the details of the case in cross-examination and I see no way of sparing her from such an exercise.\n[22] Ms. Thayer submitted that Ms. Day exhibited a lack of understanding of the proceedings and made inaccurate statements of fact from the beginning of the hearing. She gave clear examples, in her estimation, of delusional thinking. There is no doubt that the Complainant\u2019s ability to recall events accurately and testify has already been brought into question. Ms. Thayer submitted that there are two major issues that have repeatedly initiated inappropriate behaviour and breaks with reality. The first is the alleged harassment. The second is her mental well-being. The Respondents accept that Ms. Day can give accurate and even compelling evidence. But that ability deteriorates rapidly when she has to deal with the events at the heart of the case. As a result, her evidence becomes untrustworthy when she deals with the essential allegations of fact.\n[23] I share the concerns of counsel. It is manifest that the Complainant\u2019s previous breakdown was triggered by her recounting of the details of her allegations. In spite of this, I am unwilling to stop the testimony at this point. It has not been established that she cannot provide a meaningful narrative of the events that led to the filing of the complaints. One of the features of the case is that it is the demands of the process that has created the conditions that led to the Complainant\u2019s breakdown. The situation is not static and the real concern is that the process of testifying may precipitate a more pronounced and prolonged breakdown. I realize that the situation is perilous for the Complainant and that counsel are not happy with the possibility that she may have a more serious episode under the strain of their questioning. This is a matter of speculation, however, and I am not satisfied that we have reached the point where I can find that she is unable to testify.\n[24] The question of capacity only arises when the cognitive abilities of the witness are fundamentally impaired. The psychiatric testimony in Hawke, for example, established that the witness in question was hallucinating on the stand. She was also accompanied, in her mind, by a little girl called Delores. This companion was, in the words of the witness, at p. 160, supra, in my head telling me to say things that would put me in jail and get tommy off. I have evidence before me that the present complainant has at least been dissociating on the stand, and that she may be moving in and out of reality. There is evidence of psychotic episodes in the past. But there is nothing of these proportions in the situation that comes before me.\n[25] As I have indicated, the Respondents have also submitted that the Complainant\u2019s psychological condition at the time when she was allegedly harassed renders her incapable of providing evidence that meets the necessary probative standard. This submission is premature, however, and relies upon a variety of factors, such as the diagnosis of her condition. Although the Complainant\u2019s testimony comes with many imperfections, the Respondents have not established the evidentiary basis for such a finding. The evidence of Dr. Kaplan was contested by the other psychological witnesses and is at least open to argument. There may be reasons to be concerned with this aspect of the testimony, but the more immediate concern is with the Complainant\u2019s present condition.\n[26] It became apparent during the voir dire that the experts have a different view as to the merits of the case. The experts for Ms. Day seem to believe that she was sexually harassed and feel that it is the sexual harassment that provided the traumatic event in the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that her experts diagnosed. The position on the other side is equally stark, however: it is that Ms. Day suffered from a paranoid personality disorder and merely believed that she was being harassed. Her perceptions have no connection to reality, on this view, and were the product of a psychological disorder. If the latter view is adopted, and the test of the courts is adopted, her evidence is so inherently unreliable that it would be dangerous to put it before a jury. The problem is that this asks me to rule on the merits of the case, in deciding the questions put before me on the voir dire.\n[27] Although I do not believe that we have reached the point where I can intervene, I believe that the present situation needs to be monitored. If the testimony of the Complainant continues to deteriorate, or it becomes impossible to conduct a proper hearing, it may be necessary to return to the question of capacity.\nV. THE COMPLAINANT\u2019S ABILITY TO PRESENT HER CASE [28] I have not been able to review the law with regard to the question whether the Complainant is capable of representing herself. The test may be whether she is capable of instructing counsel. This is not a decisive issue at this time, however, and I merely wish to address the concerns that the Respondents have raised with respect to the well-being of the Complainant. The experts who testified on the voir dire disagreed as to the long-term effect of Ms. Day\u2019s participation in the hearing. Dr. Hunter and Dr. Malcolm felt that it was essential, psychologically, that Ms. Day have an opportunity to see the matter through to its logical end. This may be incidental to the purpose of a hearing. I nonetheless feel that Ms. Day has a fundamental right to present her case and that the therapeutic effect of doing so is a valid consideration, in examining the rights of a complainant.\n[29] I am not as convinced as Dr. Hunter and Dr. Malcolm as to the benefit of the Complainant\u2019s participation in the hearing, and I share some of the concerns expressed by Dr. Kaplan. I do not believe, however, that it would be appropriate to intervene in the interests of the Complainant unless we reach a position where she becomes incompetent in the larger sense and cannot make decisions for herself. Up until that point, the Complainant is the only one who can decide what is in her best interests. She may make choices that run demonstrably against her interests. But that is true of anyone in society and it would be quite wrong, in my view, to treat her as a dependent. This goes directly to the legal question of dignity, which requires that tribunals and courts allow litigants to make their own decisions, however discomfiting that may be.\n[30] This is a matter of general policy. When I asked Ms. Day whether she was capable of proceeding, she was unequivocal. She feels that she can continue and advise me that she knows how to ask for help. As far as I can determine, she understands her obligations as a witness, is capable of communicating her thoughts and is generally grounded in reality. She also recognizes the need to ascertain whether her perceptions are accurate and well founded. She agreed, on my questioning, that she should not swear in the hearing room and that she is obliged to respect the other participants in the hearing. Whether she can live up to this is another matter.\n[31] The Complainant is a party to these proceedings and a finding of incapacity will probably deprive her of her right to have the complaint heard by the Tribunal. At this point, at least, I am not prepared to deprive her of that opportunity. The law of human rights is based on the dignity of the person, which requires that a tribunal respect the personal autonomy of those who come before it. This is a fundamental aspect of being a person and guarantees our freedoms. There are hazards in proceeding, and at some point, it may be necessary to intervene. But at this point, the Complainant has the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether she wishes to proceed. We have not reached the point where I can interfere with that decision.\nVI. RULING [32] I am accordingly of the view that the Complainant is capable of testifying at this point in time and can represent herself. I nevertheless have real concerns about whether she will be able to complete her case. In the circumstances, I think it is premature to rule on the application. It seems more appropriate to close the voir dire and return to the hearing, on the clear understanding that the matter may be reopened on application by the parties.\n[33] My reading of the law, such as it is, suggests that the evidence on the voir dire may be relevant on issues like credibility and should be applied to the hearing as a whole. I would, however, invite submissions from the parties on the matter. There is also an issue of accommodation that requires consideration.\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMarch 12, 2003\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE NOS.: T627\/1501 and T628\/1601\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Amanda Day v.

Mactavish\n2003\/04\/02\n[1] The Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec inc. (Groupe d\u2019aide) filed a complaint alleging that Jean Barbe harassed Mireille Des Rosiers in the course of her employment with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada. It is alleged that this harassment was based upon Mme Des Rosiers\u2019 sex, her race and her national or ethnic origin. Groupe d\u2019aide evidently filed a second complaint on Mme Des Rosiers\u2019 behalf, this complaint against her employer, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada. The complaint against Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada was settled while the matter was before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The complaint against M. Barbe has now been referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for hearing.\n[2] M. Barbe seeks production of the Minutes of Settlement documenting the settlement between Groupe d\u2019aide and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada. Groupe d\u2019aide, Radio-Canada and the Commission object to the disclosure of the settlement agreement, submitting that the agreement is privileged, and in any event, is not relevant to any of the matters in issue in the complaint against M. Barbe.\n[3] The Commission has also asked that Mme Des Rosiers be added as a complainant in this proceeding.\n[4] In a pre-hearing conference call, the Tribunal member assigned to hear this case offered the parties the option of having these motions determined by a different Tribunal member. I assume that this offer was made on the assumption that it could become necessary to review the contents of the settlement agreement. The Commission and Radio-Canada have both asked that the motions be heard by someone other than the member assigned to hear the case. M. Barbe says that this would be acceptable to him if the agreement is to be divulged in order to determine its relevance.\n[5] In the circumstances, the motions have been assigned to a different Tribunal member.\nI. M. BARBE\u2019S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT [6] M. Barbe\u2019s request raises two issues. The first is whether the settlement agreement involving Radio-Canada is relevant to this proceeding. The second is whether the agreement is subject to privilege. I will deal first with the issue of relevance, as if I were to conclude that the agreement is not relevant to this proceeding, it would be unnecessary to deal with the question of privilege.\nA. Is the Settlement Agreement Arguably Relevant to the Case Against M. Barbe? [7] M. Barbe contends that the settlement agreement between Groupe d\u2019aide and Radio-Canada is relevant to issues of both liability and damages. Insofar as liability is concerned, M. Barbe says that both the complaint against Radio-Canada and the complaint against him arise out of the same factual situation in the workplace. M. Barbe was acting in the course of his employment in his dealings with Mme Des Rosiers. M. Barbe believes that the settlement agreement contemplated the withdrawal of the complaint against Radio-Canada and the complaint against M. Barbe. The basis for this belief has not, however, been disclosed to the Tribunal.\n[8] Having forfeited her rights as against Radio-Canada and M. Barbe, M. Barbe says, Mme Des Rosiers no longer has the right to pursue him in this case. It follows that Groupe d\u2019aide cannot pursue the case on Mme Des Rosiers\u2019 behalf, depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction in relation to this complaint. Any confidentiality provision in the settlement agreement cannot operate to prevent disclosure when disclosure is required to determine if the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the case.\n[9] Insofar as the question of damages is concerned, M. Barbe says that any monies received by Mme Des Rosiers from Radio-Canada would have to be taken into account by the Tribunal in its assessment of damages against M. Barbe, so as to prevent any double recovery by Mme Des Rosiers.\n[10] The Canadian Human Rights Commission submits that the complaint against M. Barbe is separate from the complaint against Radio-Canada. The remedies sought against M. Barbe are distinct from those for which Radio-Canada could be liable. As a result, the settlement with Radio\u2011Canada has no relevance to the case against M. Barbe. The Commission further contends that it does not accord with common sense and fairness that a settlement between Groupe d\u2019aide and Radio-Canada could allow M. Barbe to avoid responsibility.\n[11] With respect to the question of damages, the Commission says that the only damages to which Mme Des Rosiers could be entitled are those for which she has not already received compensation. The Commission submits that there is no issue of double recovery in relation to non\u2011pecuniary damages, citing the decision of the Ontario Board of Inquiry in Ghosh v. Domglas Inc. (No. 2), as authority for the proposition that separate awards for non-pecuniary damages may be made against different respondents.\n[12] Radio-Canada submits that M. Barbe has failed to show how the agreement is relevant to the issues in this case. According to Radio-Canada, the settlement goes beyond the human rights complaint filed against it, but also resolves litigation involving Mme Des Rosiers, Radio-Canada and Mme Des Rosiers\u2019 union.\n[13] Questions relating to damages will only arise later in the proceedings, Radio-Canada says, and then only if the complaint against M. Barbe is substantiated. As a result, Radio-Canada submits that the issue of disclosure should be deferred until damages are being addressed.\n[14] Groupe d\u2019aide states that the agreement in issue is between Mme Des Rosiers and Radio\u2011Canada. According to Groupe d\u2019aide, separate causes of action have been asserted against Radio-Canada and M. Barbe. As Mme Des Rosiers\u2019 employer, Radio-Canada\u2019s liability is for acts of harassment taking place in the workplace, whereas M. Barbe is liable for his own conduct.\n[15] Groupe d\u2019aide says that M. Barbe should not be able to rely on the settlement between Mme Des Rosiers and Radio-Canada to let him off the hook. Rather, M. Barbe has to take responsibility for his actions and accept the consequences.\nII. ANALYSIS [16] I am satisfied that the settlement agreement is arguably relevant to issues of both liability and damages. With respect to the issue of liability, the scope of any release that may have been granted by either Groupe d\u2019aide or Mme Des Rosiers seems to me to be potentially relevant to the issue of M. Barbe\u2019s liability. Specifically, the question is whether employees, agents or servants of Radio-Canada were released by or on behalf of Mme Des Rosiers or by Groupe d\u2019aide.\n[17] Insofar as the question of damages is concerned, I am satisfied that the settlement with Radio-Canada creates the potential for double recovery by Mme Des Rosiers. In both its questionnaire and in its pre-hearing disclosure, the Commission indicates that it may be seeking to recover wages that Mme Des Rosiers may have lost as a consequence of M. Barbe\u2019s alleged actions. Clearly, any monies that Mme Des Rosiers may have already received from Radio-Canada on account of lost wages would have to be taken into account in fashioning a remedy against M. Barbe, so as to prevent double recovery.\n[18] With respect to the claim for non-pecuniary damages, the question of whether an award of non-pecuniary damages paid by one respondent should be taken into account in granting a similar remedy against a different respondent has arisen in several recent cases. In contrast to the position taken by Commission counsel in this case, the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Woiden et al. v. Lynn indicates that counsel for the Commission took the opposite position in that case. In Woiden, the Commission submitted that any payment on account of non-pecuniary damages by an employer would have to be factored into an award against the harasser himself. The Tribunal\u2019s assessment of damages proceeded on this basis. Similarly, in Bushey v. Sharma , the Tribunal noted that such a payment by an employer could be relevant in certain circumstances. As was previously noted, in Ghosh, the Ontario Board of Inquiry held that separate awards for non-pecuniary damages may be made against different respondents.\n[19] I do not have to determine whether an award of non-pecuniary damages paid by one respondent should be taken into account in granting a similar remedy against a different respondent at this stage in the proceedings. Suffice it to say that I am satisfied that the quantum of any payment made by Radio-Canada to Mme Des Rosiers for her non-pecuniary losses is arguably relevant to the assessment of the claim for non-pecuniary damages being asserted against M. Barbe.\n[20] Having concluded that aspects of the settlement agreement relating to the complaint against Radio-Canada are arguably relevant to the claim being asserted against M. Barbe, the issue is then whether the agreement is privileged, and thus protected from disclosure.\nA. Is the Settlement Agreement Privileged? [21] The Commission contends that the settlement was arrived at through the Commission\u2019s conciliation process, and is thus privileged. According to the Commission, privilege attaches not just to settlement negotiations, but to the settlement agreement itself. The agreement further contains a confidentiality clause, reflecting the parties\u2019 expectation that the agreement would remain private.\n[22] The Commission states that the agreement in this case does not fall within one of the recognized exceptions to the settlement privilege. According to the Commission, questions relating to the interpretation of the agreement can only arise as between the parties to the agreement itself, and not in relation to a stranger to the agreement, such as M. Barbe. Further, the hearing of the complaint against M. Barbe does not raise issues relating to the interpretation of the agreement, and does not, therefore, create an exceptional situation.\n[23] The Commission further notes that the settlement agreements in issue in Woiden and Bushey were not arrived at in the course of the Commission\u2019s conciliation process, and that these decisions are therefore distinguishable.\n[24] Radio-Canada submits that the parties expected that the agreement would remain confidential, primarily to protect the interests of Radio-Canada. If the agreement were disclosed, Radio-Canada says, its rights would be affected. Radio-Canada does not elaborate on what the effect of disclosure would be insofar as Radio-Canada\u2019s rights are concerned.\n[25] Groupe d\u2019aide has not made any submissions on the issue of privilege.\n[26] M. Barbe states that the opposing parties have not satisfied the burden on them to establish that the settlement agreement is indeed privileged. Even if the agreement is privileged, M. Barbe says that the privilege attaching to settlements has its limits, citing the exceptions referred to in Sopinka. He cites the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Bushey as authority for the proposition that the privilege relates to settlement negotiations, and not to the settlement agreement. While acknowledging the public policy underlying the principle that settlement negotiations be kept confidential, M. Barbe argues that a party should not be able to rely on a confidentiality provision in a settlement agreement to allow it to pursue a third party, in violation of the terms of the agreement.\n[27] M. Barbe submits that the jurisprudence establishes that the privilege can be set aside where it can be shown that the document is arguably relevant to a party\u2019s case. He has not, however, cited any authority in support of this contention.\n[28] Finally, M. Barbe states that the prejudice to him if the agreement is not disclosed outweighs that which will be suffered by the other parties if the agreement is not kept confidential.\nB. Analysis [29] M. Barbe\u2019s request requires me to balance two important and competing policy considerations: that is, the public interest in promoting the settlement of human rights disputes and the fairness requirement that parties to human rights litigation have a full opportunity to advance their positions.\n[30] There are two provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act that must be considered in determining how these competing interests are to be resolved. Subsection 47(3) provides that:\nAny information received by a conciliator in the course of attempting to reach a settlement of a complaint is confidential and may not be disclosed except with the consent of the person who gave the information.\nSubsection 50 (4) states:\nThe member or panel may not admit or accept as evidence anything that would be inadmissible in a court by reason of any privilege under the law of evidence.\n[31] I propose to consider first the more general question of whether a settlement agreement is privileged as against a third party in circumstances such as those that arise here. I will then consider the effect of subsection 47(3) of the Act, as it relates to settlement agreements arrived at through the Commission conciliation process.\n[32] Insofar as the general issue of settlement privilege is concerned, the law is clear that settlement negotiations are subject to privilege, and may only be disclosed in limited circumstances. There is a compelling public policy basis for this rule: parties should be encouraged to try to resolve their differences through negotiation, and should not be inhibited in their efforts by fear that admissions or concessions made in the course of negotiations could be used against them, in the event that the negotiations do not result in the resolution of the dispute.\n[33] While the law relating to the privileged nature of settlement negotiations is relatively clear, the law relating to concluded settlement agreements is less clear. Much of the discussion in the jurisprudence centres around the question of whether settlement negotiations lose their privileged character when they result in an agreement. Sopinka suggests that where settlement negotiations result in an agreement, evidence with respect to these negotiations may be tendered in proof of the settlement, where the existence or interpretation of the agreement is in issue. As my colleague noted in Bushey, the exceptions cited by Sopinka relate to the disclosure of settlement negotiations in specific situations. No explicit reference is made to the issue of the discoverability of settlement agreements, nor does Sopinka suggest that settlement agreements may only be disclosed in exceptional circumstances.\n[34] There is no unanimity in the jurisprudence on this point. In Derco Industries Ltd. v. A.R. Grimwood Ltd., the British Columbia Supreme Court allowed the disclosure to a plaintiff of settlement documents (including documents relating to the negotiations, as well as the settlement agreement itself) where an agreement had been entered into by several defendants in a construction dispute. In ordering that the documents be disclosed, the Court noted that the balancing of competing interests may differ when the request for disclosure comes from a stranger to the negotiations, whose interests may be affected by the settlement. This decision was subsequently affirmed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal. However, the Court of Appeal expressly declined to offer an opinion on whether a stranger to the negotiations is in a different position to the parties themselves.\n[35] The British Columbia Court of Appeal revisited this issue in Middelkamp v. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board. At issue in Middelkamp was the production of documents exchanged during settlement negotiations that had resulted in a consent order being made. In finding that the documents were privileged, and thus not subject to production, the Court reiterated that without prejudice documents communicated in the course of settlement negotiations were subject to a class privilege, whether or not an agreement was reached. In coming to this conclusion, the Court held that Derco was wrongly decided. It should be noted, however, that the issue in Middelkamp was the discoverability of documents exchanged during settlement negotiations. The discoverability of the settlement agreement itself was not before the Court.\n[36] This distinction was noted by the Alberta Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Ed Miller Sales & Rentals Ltd. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., which considered whether a stranger to unsuccessful settlement negotiations could obtain information regarding the negotiations during examinations for discovery. In concluding that a stranger to the negotiations was not entitled to disclosure of the contents of the failed negotiations, the Court distinguished Derco on the basis that in Derco, there was a concluded settlement.\n[37] The British Columbia Court of Appeal recently had cause to consider the issue of the discoverability of a settlement agreement in British Columbia Children\u2019s Hospital v. Air Products Canada Ltd., a case involving a settlement between a plaintiff and some of the defendants in a multi-party law suit. The Court concluded that its earlier decision in Middelkamp was binding authority for the proposition that settlement agreements were privileged, and thus immune from disclosure. Notwithstanding this conclusion, however, it appears that the Court did not consider this privilege to be absolute, as the Court went on to affirm the portion of the Motions Judge\u2019s ruling requiring disclosure of any provision in the settlement agreement that could be construed as a release, on the basis that it was potentially relevant to the matters still in issue in the litigation. Thus it appears that disclosure can be ordered in situations where the settlement agreement is potentially relevant to issues still alive in ongoing litigation.\n[38] It should be recalled that it is the provisions in the settlement agreement between Groupe D\u2019aide and Radio-Canada that could be construed as a release of M. Barbe that I have found to be arguably relevant to the issue of liability in this case.\n[39] The House of Lords considered the discoverability of correspondence leading up to a concluded settlement agreement in Rush & Tompkins Ltd. v. Greater London Council and Another. The Court concluded that without prejudice correspondence sent in the course of settlement negotiations remain privileged, even if an agreement is concluded. The correspondence was thus inadmissible in subsequent litigation involving the same subject matter, whether it involved the same or different parties. In arriving at this conclusion, the Court noted that allowing admissions made in an effort to effect a compromise to be used in subsequent litigation would serve to discourage efforts to settle. As a result, the Court concluded that settlement negotiations should not be disclosed, whether or not the negotiations subsequently led to an agreement. Once again, however, the Court was concerned with the production of correspondence leading up to the settlement, as opposed to the settlement agreement itself.\n[40] The English Court of Appeal subsequently had occasion to consider the application of the House of Lords\u2019 decision in Rush & Tompkins to a case where a settlement agreement had been concluded. In Gnitrow Ltd. v. Cape PLC., the Court stayed a claim against a defendant, until such time as the plaintiff disclosed the terms of an agreement entered into between the plaintiff and other parties. Disclosure was required on the grounds that there was a relationship between what the plaintiff was claiming from the defendant, and the monies that the plaintiff had been required to pay to the other parties. In making this order, the Court indicated that each case where access to a settlement agreement was being sought should be considered in light of the specific circumstances in issue.\n[41] In this case, I have found that there is a potential relationship between the monies that the complainant or Mme Des Rosiers have received from Radio-Canada and the damages claimed against M. Barbe.\n[42] In determining whether a settlement agreement is privileged, and thus exempt from disclosure, it is helpful to keep in mind the public policy reason underlying the recognition of a settlement privilege. As Sopinka noted, in considering the privilege attached to settlement negotiations, ... the exclusionary role (sic) was meant to conceal an offer of settlement only if an attempt was made to establish it as evidence of liability or a weak cause of action, not when it is used for other purposes.\n[43] Keeping this principle in mind, it seems that while settlement negotiations are privileged, whether or not an agreement is ultimately reached, the settlement agreement itself is not absolutely privileged, and may be disclosed when it relates to live issues in ongoing litigation. As long as the agreement has potential relevance, other than as an admission against interest, and is not being used simply to establish one party\u2019s liability or the weakness of that party\u2019s position, the privilege does not bar production.\n[44] Having concluded that the settlement agreement is not subject to an absolute privilege, and may be disclosed when it relates to live issues in ongoing litigation, subsection 50(4) of the Canadian Human Rights Act is no longer relevant. What remains to be determined is whether the fact that the agreement was arrived at through the auspices of the Commission\u2019s conciliation process affects the discoverability of the agreement.\n[45] The only jurisprudence of which I am aware that considers this provision in the legislation is the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Paul. At issue in Paul was the propriety of information relating to failed attempts at conciliation, including an offer of settlement, being provided to the Commissioners of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, for consideration by the Commissioners in deciding how to dispose of the case.\n[46] The Court concluded that subsection 47(3) contained an absolute prohibition against the disclosure of any information received by the conciliator. The Court noted that such a prohibition was consistent with the common law settlement privilege relating to settlement negotiations, and was all the more necessary in light of the mandatory nature of Commission conciliation.\n[47] As previously noted, Paul deals with disclosure of settlement negotiations. The Court was not called upon to determine whether a settlement agreement negotiated through the conciliation process could be disclosed. The Court did note, in passing, that Section 48 of the Act requires Commission approval of settlements reached prior to the commencement of hearings. In the Court\u2019s view, a request for Commission approval is the consent to disclosure of the terms of the settlement. This obiter statement could be interpreted to mean that subsection 47(3) requires that consent be provided for the disclosure of conciliated settlement agreements.\n[48] However, regard must be had to the wording of subsection 47(3) itself. The French version of the subsection states that Les renseignements recueillis par le conciliateur sont confidentiels ..., whereas the English version refers to information received by the conciliator ... in the course of attempting to reach a settlement .... Thus the English version arguably relates only to communications made during negotiations leading up to a settlement, and not to the settlement agreement itself. Such an interpretation would be consistent with the policy considerations discussed earlier in this ruling, in that any concessions or admissions made by a party to a conciliation could not be used against them, once a settlement was concluded.\n[49] For these reasons I am of the view that the settlement agreement is not protected by either a statutory or common law privilege.\nC. Should the Agreement be Produced in its Entirety? [50] Even though I have concluded that the settlement agreement is not protected by either a statutory or common law privilege, it is not disputed that the agreement was entered into by the parties in the expectation that it would remain confidential. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the agreement should not be disclosed beyond what is necessary to ensure M. Barbe the opportunity to mount a full answer and defense to the complaint against him. As a result, I am imposing certain terms on the disclosure.\n[51] In order to ensure that the confidentiality of the agreement is not breached more than is absolutely necessary to provide a fair hearing, I am directing the Commission and Groupe d\u2019aide to deliver a copy of the agreement to the Tribunal Registry within five days of this decision, in order that I may review it, and ensure that only the arguably relevant provisions are disclosed to M. Barbe.\n[52] What may be arguably relevant at this point will depend on whether the issues of liability and damages are dealt with at the same time. Based upon the information before me, it appears that only a portion of the agreement will likely relate to the issue of liability. Other provisions could be relevant to the assessment of damages. At this point, the issues of liability and damages have not been bifurcated. I propose to review the document, and release to M. Barbe those portions that are arguably relevant to issues of both liability and damages, unless a request is received from any of the parties for a bifurcation of the hearing. Any such request must be received by the Tribunal within seven days of this decision.\n[53] If a request for bifurcation is received, only those provisions of the agreement that are arguably relevant to the issue of liability will be disclosed, pending a determination of the request for bifurcation. In the event that the member assigned to hear this case decides to bifurcate the hearing, provisions of the agreement that are arguably relevant only to the assessment of damages will not be disclosed at this time.\n[54] In the event that the complaint against M. Barbe is substantiated, I will review the agreement and direct that those provisions that are arguably relevant to the issue of damages be disclosed.\n[55] Any provisions of the settlement agreement disclosed to M. Barbe are disclosed upon the following additional terms:\nThe agreement shall only be used by M. Barbe and his counsel for the purposes of the hearing into the complaint against M. Barbe; and No copies are to be made of any of the provisions of the settlement agreement that are disclosed. Within thirty days of the conclusion of the hearing, counsel for M. Barbe shall return any settlement documentation received by him to the Commission, unless an application for judicial review of the Tribunal\u2019s decision has been filed.\n[56] It should be noted that this decision relates only to the question of the production of the settlement agreement. Its ultimate admissibility will have to be determined by the member hearing the case.\n[57] Counsel for Radio-Canada asked that I indicate to the parties that no mention will be made of the terms of the settlement in the Tribunal\u2019s decision. It is not up to me to commit the member who will be hearing the merits of this case to say, or not say, something in his decision. Indeed, it would be highly inappropriate for me to do so. If the parties have any concerns in this regard, they may raise these concerns with the member hearing the case. Similarly, any concerns with respect to sealing the record should be addressed in the course of the hearing.\nIII. THE ADDITION OF MME DES ROSIERS AS A COMPLAINANT [58] The Commission has asked that the style of cause in this proceeding be amended to add Mme. Des Rosiers as a complainant. According to the Commission, Mme. Des Rosiers is the person directly aggrieved in this case, and the party to whose benefit any remedies should accrue. The addition of Mme. Des Rosiers as a complainant would avoid any ambiguity in the proceeding, the Commission says, and would not result in any prejudice to the respondent.\n[59] M. Barbe objects to the request, submitting that Mme. Des Rosiers no longer has any interest in the case.\n[60] I assume that M. Barbe\u2019s submission is based upon what he believes is contained in the settlement agreement between Mme. Des Rosiers and Radio-Canada. At this point, however, there is no evidence before me to suggest that Mme. Des Rosiers no longer has an interest in the case.\n[61] I am not prepared to grant the Commission\u2019s request at this point. This case is somewhat unusual, in that the complaint was filed by an organization on behalf of the individual directly implicated in the case. There is no information before me as to why Mme. Des Rosiers did not file the complaint herself in the first place, and I am thus unable to determine whether it would be appropriate to allow her to join the case at this late date.\n[62] The Commission\u2019s request also presumes that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to add a complainant after the case has gone through the Commission process, in such circumstances.\n[63] Accordingly, I am adjourning the Commission\u2019s request to add Mme. Des Rosiers as a complainant, to be dealt with by the member assigned to hear this case, upon the filing of a more complete evidentiary record.\nAnne L.

IS THE COMPLAINANT CAPABLE OF TESTIFYING?\nII. IS THE COMPLAINANT CAPABLE OF PROSECUTING THE CASE?\nIII. DISMISSAL\nIV. BAN ON PUBLICATION\nV. PRIVATE RECORDS\nVI. A FINAL REMARK\nVII. RULING\n[1] The following is my second ruling on the question of competence, which originally arose in the course of the Complainant\u2019s evidence-in-chief.I have attached the previous ruling as AppendixA.In the course of that ruling, I expressed misgivings as to the Complainant\u2019s ability to testify and stated that her participation in the process should be monitored.A number of additional concerns arose during cross-examination.I subsequently allowed the Respondents to renew their application for a finding that the Complainant was not capable of testifying.\nI. IS THE COMPLAINANT CAPABLE OF TESTIFYING? [2] The original application was renewed on the basis of a number of remarks that were made during the early stages of cross-examination.The Respondents have provided me with part of the recent transcript, which has been marked as an exhibit in the voir dire.Counsel have highlighted the passages that concern them and submit that it would be a mistake to continue. They have taken the position from the outset of the hearing that the Complainant\u2019s allegations are the product of a psychological disorder.\n[3] I have attached some of the more telling references in Appendix B, along with an excerpt in which the Complainant describes her condition during the period when she was allegedly harassed.The most troubling evidence is that the Complainant is convinced that other people have implanted thoughts or phrases in her mind. She believes that this was happening during the period of the alleged harassment.It has also happened more recently.The general idea appears to be that people have implanted subliminal suggestions in her mind, which she is compelled to obey.The Complainant accordingly believes that she has been programmed to act in certain ways.\n[4] This includes the making of statements that have no obvious connection to the circumstances in which they have been said.The Complainant has testified that she said \u201cI see Helter Skelter\u201d when she saw a picture of a naked woman in the dockyard.She states that she made this statement because someone by the name of Robin had said that she would do so, years before the complaint arose.She was also programmed to say \u201cI have AIDS\u201d, when she was found to be HIV negative, and \u201coink, oink, get it\u201d in circumstances that can only be described as bizarre.The same person, who she referred to as \u201cRotten Robin\u201d, also told her that she was to turn herself into a mental institution at some point in time. The story is confused, but this is related to the fact that she agreed to help someone who was a prostitute.\n[5] The problem is that these kinds of remarks extend to the subject matter of the complaints before me.The Complainant testified that at one point, at least, she believed that God was telling her to make the complaint.She is also convinced that the individual Respondent programmed her to hear certain frequencies and play a popular song on the guitar, without having to learn it. Some of her remarks are less benign.The Complainant stated on two occasions that the Respondent may have programmed her to harm herself or commit suicide.She also stated that the Respondent has been programmed.Since she is aware of this programming, she feels that she is in the best position to cross-examine him.\n[6] This only sets out the some of the more troubling aspects of the testimony.The Respondents have expressed other concerns. There is evidence of her dissociating on the stand and losing contact with reality, whatever view is taken of her psychological state.Her conduct on and off the witness stand has been erratic and emotional.There are any number of troubling incidents before me, all of which attest to the difficulty that the Complainant has experienced in the hearing.Some of this behaviour is described in my earlier ruling on competence.\n[7] The Respondents have submitted that the Complainant cannot meet the criteria set out by Dubin, J.A. in R. v. Hawke (1975) 7 O.R. (2d) 145.There seem to be two branches to the test in the jurisprudence.A witness cannot give evidence if the Tribunal is satisfied that either\n1) her current psychological state, or\n2) her psychological state at the time of the events in question prevents her from giving testimony that could be relied upon by a reasonable trier of fact.This is ultimately a legal and not a psychological question.It is the Tribunal that is in the best position to judge the probative quality of the evidence before it.The most significant consideration in a case like the one before me will normally be the conduct of the witness on the stand.\n[8] I permitted the Complainant to give her evidence in chief, in spite of the difficulties that she was experiencing on the stand. Some of her evidence was intelligible and reasonably lucid.Some of her more recent testimony, however, has no apparent basis in reality.Although the Complainant has stated that she \u201creality tests\u201d herself, she is unwilling to consider the possibility that the disordered perceptions that I have described are the product of a psychological condition.In the words of counsel, she will not accept any reality other than her own.\n[9] The Complainant is unable to discern the difference between her disordered perceptions and reality.This inability goes back to the period of the alleged harassment.The problem lies in separating the more reliable parts of the Complainant\u2019s evidence from the less reliable.This is exactly the kind of situation, it seems to me, where a judge would be forced to declare a mistrial, if this kind of evidence went before a jury.There comes a point where a Tribunal can no longer ascertain the accuracy of a witness\u2019 testimony.\n[10] I believe that the circumstances before me are more than enough to set aside the usual presumption that a witness is competent.I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Complainant\u2019s testimony fails both branches of the legal test.It would be manifestly unreasonable to make decisions on the basis of her testimony. I do not believe that a trier of fact could safely rely on her evidence, in rendering a decision against the Respondents.It follows that the testimony of the Complainant is not admissible in the proceedings before me.\nII. IS THE COMPLAINANT CAPABLE OF PROSECUTING THE CASE? [11] I think it is only fair to say that the Complainant\u2019s participation in the present process is fraught with difficulty. The Respondents have argued that she does not have the psychological capacity to prosecute the case.Counsel was unable to provide me with any caselaw on the subject and I have already indicated on the record that this kind of finding comes uncomfortably close to a finding that an individual is not competent in the more general legal sense.This goes well beyond my role.I have neither the authority nor the inclination to express an opinion on the question whether the Complainant is competent in the larger sense.I am nevertheless satisfied, in spite of my concerns, that I have the ancillary authority to determine whether she is capable of participating in the hearing.\n[12] It is important to be cautious.As I understand it, the law only requires that a person instructing counsel have a basic grasp of the decisions that need to be made in the course of the legal process.I have alreadysuggested to counsel that a Tribunal can only intervene in the clearest cases, when a party loses the ability to make the most fundamental decisions regarding the management of the case.The question whether a party is capable of participating in a legal proceeding is usually decided by determining whether she is capable of instructing counsel.It is the ability and condition of the Complainant that must be examined in this context, rather than the difficulty of the proceedings.Individuals have the right to represent themselves, even where they have little of the training that would normally be required, in dealing with the issues before a Tribunal.\n[13] The real problem before me is a practical one, since it is the Complainant that has carriage of the case.I realize that the case before me would be difficult for any Complainant, particularly without the advantage of counsel.The Complainant\u2019s difficulties go beyond such ordinary concerns, however.The Complainant has difficulty restraining herself when her emotions are engaged and has often been disruptive.I do not believe that she has the emotional and psychological resources to participate normally in the process, whatever accommodation I can give her.It would be a mistake to be too rigid in these matters, but the decorum and integrity of the process need to be respected.This has a real bearing on the fairness of the process.\n[14] A party cannot avail itself of the benefits of the legal process and reject the authority of the body with the responsibility for deciding the case.The Complainant has been disruptive and apparently feels that there is a concerted effort to deprive her of her rights.She is quick to interrupt counsel and accuse the other parties of misusing the process.When she realized that I was likely to rule against her on the present application, she turned her attention to the Tribunal.Rather than appear for the last day of the hearing, she took the view, in correspondence with the Registry Officer, that the Tribunal had set out to publicly humiliate her.This can only be taken as another manifestation of her psychological condition. Although the Complainant often exhibits the indicia of an ordinary person, there is an irrational side to her behaviour which continually interferes with her ability to participate in the process.\n[15] Similar issues have been dealt with in the criminal courts, though there are significant differences between the two processes. The judgement of the Supreme Court in R. v. Whittle [1994] 2 S.C.R. 914 deals incidentally with the fitness of an accused to stand trial.It holds, at p. 933, that an accused only requires a \u201climited cognitive capacity to understand the process\u201d.Although this sets the threshold very low, it accepts the relevant provision in the Criminal Code, which poses the question whether the accused is able to \u201cconduct a defence\u201d or instruct counsel to do so.The judgement suggests that a party must be able to make a choice, and I would go further and state that it must be a meaningful choice.A party whose choices are entirely arbitrary is not capable of participating in the legal process.\n[16] As a general principle, it seems unlikely that a person who is incapable of testifying because she suffers from an existing disorder would be able to make the kind of decisions necessary to instruct counsel.I say this because a person who testifies as a witness need only provide a trustworthy narrative of select events.This does not require an ability to make decisions regarding the conduct of the case.I cannot say whether the decision in Whittle throws this into question.It nevertheless seems to me that a party must have some appreciation of the consequences of the decisions that need to be made in prosecuting the matter.In the present case, for example, the Complainant requested an order that the public guardian divulge its records regarding a recent application to have her committed.She appeared unable, however, to recognize that such an application might disclose information that would assist the Respondents, either on the question of competence or the merits of the case.\n[17] The Complainant has already found it difficult to give her evidence-in-chief.We have only begun her cross-examination, after a month of hearing, and have not come anywhere near the material allegations.I do not want to speculate as to the difficulties that she will experience when counsel endeavours to test her evidence regarding the rather lurid sexual allegations that have come before me.I do not believe that it is feasible to embark on such an endeavour, however, and believe that it would be a mistake to take the process any further.Nor do I believe that the Complainant is capable of cross-examining the individual Respondent in a proper manner and feel obliged to say that there are real dangers in allowing her to do so.I am concerned that she has other reasons for seeking such a confrontation, which have more to do with her psychological fixations than the purposes of the hearing process.\n[18] In the circumstances, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Complainant is incapable of participating in the process or instructing counsel to represent her interests.I do not believe that she can make the decisions that are required in prosecuting the case.I am also concerned that her failure to make meaningful decisions will lead her to act in a way that causes her serious and irreparable harm, legally, emotionally and psychologically.I think the report of Dr. Kaplan, which was entered as an exhibit in the voir dire, deserves serious consideration in this context.\nIII. DISMISSAL [19] There is no way of going forward with the hearing at this point in time.There may nevertheless be a number of ways of resolving the present situation.I have raised the possibility, for example, of a mistrial.The essential choice, however, is between adjourning the matter and dismissing the complaints.In theory, at least, the matter could be adjourned sine die, with the idea that another hearing could be held, if the Complainant becomes competent in the future.This would be more feasible if the complaints were of recent origin.\n[20] In my view, the present case has already been delayed for too long.While the Respondents share some of the responsibility for the delay, at least before the Tribunal, I think that justice lies in bringing the matter to a close.It is time to bring this long and painful process to a close.I am particularly concerned about the individual Respondent, who has had to live with these allegations, in one way or the other, for eight or nine years.Many of the allegations are extravagant and extremely embarrassing.They include allegations of rape and sexual misconduct with children.The Respondents have argued from the beginning that they are entirely without substance.There have been a number of investigations and I do not believe it would serve the interests of justice to return to the case in two or three years, only to restart the process.As the Complainant herself observed, the present process has already exhausted substantial public resources.\n[21] One of the complaints before me deals with the presence of pornography at the dockyard. This raised institutional issues that concern me.As a practical matter, however, I do not feel that it is possible to sever this complaint from the other complaints.Although the matter is less pressing for the corporate Respondent, there is no doubt that matters like the one before me can only have a demoralizing effect on employees.All three complaints have touched the lives of individual officers and employees, who want to be free of the Complainant\u2019s allegations.In the military context, I also think that the corporate self\u2011esteem of the Respondent deserves some measure of protection.The present case has a scandalous side, which reaches out beyond those who have been directly affected by the investigation and the hearing.\n[22] The Complainant has already had the benefit of a lengthy hearing.She has been given every reasonable opportunity to present evidence and in a qualified sense, at least, I think the Respondents have been under jeopardy.I seem to have the reverse of the situation in the courts, where a request for an adjournment is rejected and a party is called upon to present its case.If it fails to do so, the opposing party is entitled to a decision on the merits.Here there is a failure to present evidence, followed at least constructively by a request for an adjournment.I am nonetheless of the view that the fundamental logic of the two situations is the same.Since it would be unfair to adjourn the case, and I have rejected such a possibility, I think the Respondents are entitled to a dismissal.The rules against double jeopardy should apply in both circumstances.\n[23] One of the virtues of the legal process is its finality.Once a complaint is substantiated or dismissed, the issue of liability is closed.The Tribunal is functus and the matter is res judicata.If the Tribunal has erred, the parties may seek judicial review.Otherwise, the parties must abide by the results.This is one of the benefits of any court or Tribunal process.At some point, people must move on with their lives.\nIV. BAN ON PUBLICATION [24] There are two other matters that need to be addressed. The first is that I see no compelling reason to maintain the ban on publication of these proceedings.The mere fact that the allegations are offensive is not sufficient to justify a ban on publication.Mr.Hortie may take the dismissal of the complaint as a vindication of his position and anyone who recites the allegations is obliged to respect the fact that the complaint has been dismissed.If they misrepresent the matter, or fail to respect the truth, Mr. Hortie and others have the usual remedies.\n[25] The public and the press are entitled to review the Tribunal process and the results in particular cases.Freedom of expression requires some freedom of communication.This is a fundamental part of our system and adds to the justice of the process.\n[26] Although I am concerned about the disclosure of personal information relating to the Complainant, the Complainant has requested that the publication ban be lifted.In spite of my finding that she is not competent to represent herself, I feel obliged to take her views into account. She is firmly of the view that a public airing of the matter is important.\nV. PRIVATE RECORDS [27] The Respondents are in possession of an extensive amount of personal information concerning Ms. Day.This information includes medical and psychological records, which go into areas of inquiry that are normally outside legal scrutiny.There is the report of Dr. Williams, for example, which was made when the Complainant was committed to the EricMartin Pavilion in November 2000, against her will.This report sets out the Complainant\u2019s precarious emotional and psychological state at the time in considerable detail.The Respondents are also in possession of the notes made by the Complainant in preparing a lengthy account of what occurred.Dr. Kaplan, the expert witness who testified for the Respondents, has similar material in his possession.\n[28] This is information that would normally be kept within the private sanctum and would not be released to other parties.The material was released because the Respondents had put the Complainant\u2019s general psychological state into issue in the hearing.This provided the basis of their defence.The complaint has now been dismissed, however, these issues have no more life in them.I do not see why the other parties would be entitled to retain this information without compelling reasons.None have been advanced.\n[29] The Complainant understandably objects to these documents remaining in the possession of the other parties. In my view, her request is a reasonable one. The Supreme Court has recognized that claims of privacy in this area have some constitutional significance.This information is entitled to the same protection as our innermost thoughts.There is no reason for third parties to review such personal information after the hearing has been completed, whether by accident or design.\n[30] The Respondents have nevertheless expressed a concern that these documents may be destroyed.This is a concern because the Complainant has already stated that she intends to pursue the matter in other forums.She has also stated that she would have destroyed her notes if she had known that they would be disclosed.There are other ways of dealing with these concerns, however.In the circumstances, I think the matter can be dealt with by providing the material to the Tribunal, on the understanding that the material will be kept under seal.If the material is required in the future, the Respondents can apply to the Tribunal for an order to disclose it.\nVI. A FINAL REMARK [31] I realize the Complainant will be disappointed and perhaps angry with these results.She appears to feel that the entire process has betrayed her.Some of this is a product of her experience on the witness stand.She feels that she has been asked to tell the truth, only to be punished for speaking openly about her psychological experiences.I understand her feelings in this regard, but there is nothing I can say, other than to commend her for speaking candidly.This does not have any bearing on the result.\n[32] There are limits to the legal process and there are situations where it is simply impossible to proceed.There is nevertheless a positive side to the present hearing.Although there were many difficulties with the process, the most important aspect of the matter may be that the Complainant completed her evidence-in-chief, even if that testimony was ultimately rendered inadmissible.Life is imperfect but there is a real sense in which she has had her day in court.This is important enough to justify the process.There is nothing more that I can say.\nVII. RULING [33] I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Complainant is incapable of testifying.I am also satisfied that she is incapable of making meaningful decisions regarding the conduct and progress of her case.She does not have the capacity to participate in the hearing.I want it to be clear on the public record that I have serious concerns for her well-being if the process continues.\n[34] In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Complainant has had an ample opportunity to present her case, insofar as that is possible. There is no evidence before me to substantiate her allegations and the complaints are dismissed.\n[35] The ban on publication is hereby lifted. The medical and psychological records pertaining to the Complainant, along with the personal notes, may be held for six months from the expiry of any period of review or subsequent appeal.This should be more than sufficient to review the files.If the Respondents wish to provide the Tribunal with a copy of the relevant material, it will be kept under seal.The other copies in the possession of the Respondents are to be destroyed.I would appreciate a letter from counsel, confirming that each of the Respondents have complied with this direction.I will retain the jurisdiction to vary this aspect of my order, should other circumstances arise.\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nApril4, 2003\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE NOS.: T627\/1501 and T628\/1601\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Amanda Day v.

THE APPLICATION BEFORE ME [1] The following are my reasons on the application of the Respondents for a ruling that the Complainant is not competent to testify in these proceedings.I prefer to phrase this as a question of capacity, and avoid the pejorative associations of the word featured in the caselaw.There is a second question that has arisen in this context, which is whether the Complainant is capable of representing herself.In the circumstances of the case, I do not believe that it would be in the interests of the parties to interrupt the process in order to prepare extensive reasons.I nevertheless feel obliged to issue written reasons before proceeding further.\n[2] Before dealing with the background to the application, I would comment that the second question might seem to require a higher degree of capacity, since a party who is competent to proceed must be capable of participating in the conduct of the process.This would normally appear to present a higher standard than the capacity to give probative evidence, which need only be sufficient to assist the trier of fact.The usual logic of the situation seems to be reversed, however, in the circumstances before me.That is because the Complainant\u2019s primary difficulty, as Ms. Thayer submitted, is in reciting the sexual allegations at the core of the complaint. This is undoubtedly the most difficult aspect of the matter from a legal perspective.\n[3] Although I have focussed more directly on the first question, which relates to the Complainant\u2019s ability to testify, the reality is that there is a general concern for her psychological condition that goes to all aspects of the case.I want to reassure the Complainant that, in my view, the other parties have acted out of respect for the integrity of the process and with a keen concern for the Complainant\u2019s well-being. There is nothing improper in the application:on the contrary, I think it would have been inappropriate to proceed without canvassing these issues.This holds true, whatever my ruling on the application.\nII. GENERAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE [4] I should state at the outset that the present case seems to have a troubled history.There is no escaping the fact that the psychological history of the Complainant is relevant to the present proceedings.The medical record, which has not been independently proven, indicates that she has been committed in the past.There is no point in hiding this fact:it does not necessarily speak to the Complainant\u2019s present circumstances and as far as I am aware, there is no suggestion from counsel that she is incompetent in the larger legal sense.This merely provides the background to the present application and illustrates, along with the rest of the medical and psychological record, that there are reasons for concern.\n[5] Although I am not privy to the events that may have transpired before the hearing, the Complainant has indicated on a number of occasions that the Human Rights Commission and the other parties sought an order declaring her incompetent.I am not exaggerating when I say that she feels that there was something like a conspiracy to have her committed.I do not know the full details of the matter, but there is enough on the Tribunal file to suggest that there are reasons for the Complainant\u2019s suspicions.This is not intended as a criticism:this has been a difficult matter for everyone involved with it, and I merely feel obliged to set out the larger set of circumstances behind the present application.\n[6] The Complainant inevitably feels that any earlier efforts to have her declared incompetent were merely a convenient way of disposing of the present inquiry.It follows that she is extremely suspicious of the present attempt by the other parties to question her capacity to participate in the hearing.She believes that it is beneficial to her psychological well-being to continue and there is at least some medical evidence that supports such a contention.This raises issues that go beyond the scope of my authority, however, and the Complainant\u2019s legal position is that she has a right to proceed.This includes the right to testify and present her account of what occurred.I have warned her that she will be subject to a full and searching cross-examination, which will undoubtedly raise painful memories and prove emotionally difficult.This does not dissuade her.\nIII. BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT APPLICATION [7] There is no question that the application has been properly and responsibly made.The Complainant displayed erratic behaviour in giving her evidence in chief.This consisted of contorted facial expressions, inappropriate pauses, a pronounced shaking of her head, a raising of her arms and the adoption of various postures, all of which presented a departure from the normal presentation of viva voce evidence.I mention these attributes of her testimony because they are not apparent on the face of the record.The Complainant also used expletives, began sobbing, would occasionally raise her voice or adopt a theatrical and mocking tone, and was unable to continue on a number of occasions.The most difficult aspect of her evidence, from the perspective of managing the case, is that she found it difficult, even impossible, to confine herself to the narrative of events that led to the present complaint.She constantly went into other matters, occasionally in a manner that seems strange and even bizarre, to anyone with a developed sense of relevance.\n[8] I accept, as counsel has submitted, that the Complainant\u2019s behaviour deteriorated as she gave evidence and eventually culminated in what I have described on the record as a \u201cscreaming fit\u201d, which happened when she found herself unable to describe one of the alleged incidents of sexual harassment.I think this can best be described as formless screaming:there were no words, as far as I could determine, and to a lay person, at least, the Complainant cried inconsolably, like an infant.The Tribunal officer immediately called for order and I left the hearing room, though it is clear that she fell to the floor, \u201cwrithing\u201d, in the words of counsel and remained there until after the room was cleared.Dr. Kaplan, a psychologist for the Respondents, advised the Tribunal Officer to phone 911, a suggestion that was carried out.This should not be interpreted as a comment on the nature of what occurred, which became a source of controversy between the parties.\n[9] One of the security officers, Ms. Dennis, remained in the hearing room and later testified as to what occurred.Her testimony was measured and careful evidence, and I accept her account of events.The only point that I feel obliged to clarify is that the hearing was not resumed in the absence of the Complainant.This was never a consideration, though the situation might have transpired differently if Ms. Day had been hospitalized. In my view, the matter was handled with the right degree of concern for the well-being of the Complainant and the need to protect the propriety of the process.After the Complainant had recovered, the hearing was briefly resumed, and the Complainant indicated that she wished to continue with her evidence. The other parties understandably requested a recess.The Complainant became visibly angry in response to the submissions of counsel, and I felt it was best to adjourn until the following day, at which time the Respondents brought the present application.\n[10] I want to be fair.There is a sense in which this puts the matter in the worst light.I should make it clear that the Complainant is an intelligent person who often speaks lucidly and has a real appreciation of the nature and purpose of the present proceedings.She has given coherent testimony that would support the complaints.One of the problems is that she is not familiar with the practices in formal legal proceedings, and like many lay people, does not distinguish between a formal and informal venue.As a result, her manner and language is often inappropriate.She is unrepresented, which has added to her difficulties, and often seems overwhelmed by the minutiae of the evidence.Having said that, and made allowances for her lack of familiarity with legal proceedings, her psychological frailty, and her many interruptions, she appears to understand the process and has some rough ability to conduct her case and present evidence. There is no doubt that this has placed enormous demands on the patience of counsel, and myself, but that is another matter, which goes more to the issue of accommodation.\n[11] After the application was made, I entered into a voir dire for the purpose of deciding the question of competence.The Respondents called Dr. Kaplan, a clinical psychologist, who was in attendance during the hearing.Dr. Kaplan was qualified as an expert and expressed serious reservations about proceeding.He was of the opinion that the Complainant suffers from a paranoid personality disorder, which makes her perception of events inherently unreliable.He also testified that, in his view, the Complainant had gone into a psychotic state while testifying.Dr. Kaplan also prepared a written report, which has been entered as an exhibit in the voir dire.Ms. Thayer placed considerable reliance on his view that the Complainant was having psychotic episodes at the time that she was experiencing the alleged sexual harassment.The cases suggest that this is a major consideration, but this goes to the merits of the case, and the evidence is far from clear at this point in time.\n[12] The Complainant called Ms. Dennis in reply, along with two experts, who were duly qualified.Her therapist also appeared at the hearing, though she did not testify.The evidence of Dr. Hunter, a medical doctor with expertise in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, was essentially that Ms. Day\u2019s behaviour was consistent with such a diagnosis.The other expert witness, Dr. Malcolm, a clinical psychologist, adopted much the same position. Dr. Malcolm has treated the Complainant in the past and was consulted by the Complainant prior to the beginning of the proceedings.Mr. Houston objected vigorously to the fact that Dr. Hunter and Dr. Malcolm believed that it would be an injustice to deprive the Complainant of her right to proceed.These opinions were well intentioned and reflected their view that it would be better for the Complainant to proceed, psychologically.The question of justice is entirely within the keeping of the Tribunal, however, and well outside the scope of expert evidence.\n[13] The Respondents also attacked the reliability of the testimony of Dr. Hunter and Dr. Malcolm, on the basis that they were poorly apprised of the circumstances before me.They also argued, understandably, that Dr. Kaplan was in a better position to provide an informed opinion as to the Complainant\u2019s behaviour on the witness stand.I think there is some merit to these submissions, which may affect the weight of the testimony but does not negate it.I think it is important, in this context, to appreciate that the Respondents have the burden of satisfying me that the Complainant is incapable of testifying.There is no obligation on the Complainant to prove any positive assertion of fact.The evidence that she called on the voir dire was only called to offset the evidence of the Respondents and the experts were not tendered to prove her competence.\n[14] I am left with a disagreement between the experts as to the exact nature of the situation that confronts me.I do not propose to enter into the details of this disagreement, though there was a more specific dispute as to what occurred when she began screaming.Dr. Kaplan was of the view that the Complainant was rapidly \u201cdecompensating\u201d.This terminology was the subject of some discussion.The experts on the other side were more inclined to believe that she had experienced a flashback or \u201cabreaction\u201d, in which she was reliving the traumatic events in question.There was also a suggestion that she was dissociating.I do not propose to settle the dispute: whatever view is adopted, it is evident that the Complainant was not functioning rationally for the duration of the episode.\n[15] I cannot make a medical or psychological diagnosis, but there are many reasons to believe that she suffers from paranoia in some general sense.I was advised by Dr. Hunter and Dr. Malcolm that this could be a manifestation of the \u201chypervigilance\u201d associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.I accept that that she is liable to \u201cdissociate\u201d on the witness stand and may be in danger of losing contact with reality.She does not trust counsel, has difficulty restraining her emotions, and often loses her way on the witness stand.Some of this must be attributed to the fact that the allegations before me are extremely personal and would be difficult for any litigant.Dr. Hunter testified that Ms. Day had an underlying \u201cvulnerability\u201d that makes them all the more trying for someone in her position.All of this presents a challenge for the conduct of the inquiry.\nIV. THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE APPLICATION [16] The cases hold that it is the business of a judge to decide whether a witness is capable of testifying.It is the business of the jury to weigh the evidence. See:R. Harbuz [1979] 2 W.W.R. 105 and Steinberg v. The King (1931) 56 C.C.C. 9 (S.C.C.).As a result, the question should be dealt with at the earliest possible opportunity, in order to avoid the possibility of a mistrial.These concerns do not arise in the situation before me.The caselaw recognizes, moreover, that the question can be considered at a later point, if concerns arise during the course of a witness\u2019 testimony.\n[17] The law operates on the presumption that a witness has the capacity to testify.This does not require advanced abilities.The same observation can be applied to the question whether a party is capable of conducting its case, which only requires an ability to make basic personal decisions.The Respondents have accepted that they have an obligation to demonstrate, presumably on a balance of probabilities, that the Complainant is incapable of testifying.They rely principally on R. v. Hawke (1975) 7 O.R. (2d) 145 (Ont. C.A.), which is instructive on the general issue.They have also referred me to Sopinka\u2019s Law of Evidence in Canada (2d), at \u00a713.10 et. seq., which provides a very brief account of the law.\n[18] The court in Hawke uses the antique and now unsettling language of Wigmore, at \u00a7i492, in holding that a witness is only disqualified from testifying if \u201cthe derangement or defect\u201d is such as to undermine the witness\u2019 ability to give trustworthy evidence on \u201cthe specific subject of the testimony\u201d.The fact that the Complainant may have a psychological condition or paranoid personality disorder, or may be suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, does not prevent her from testifying.I do not know if a test has been enunciated in the caselaw, but the question is whether a trier of fact can properly and safely consider the evidence, in making a determination of the facts.The use of the word \u201ctrustworthy\u201d is easily misinterpreted and the issue is not whether her testimony should be believed.It is whether it is capable of being believed.\n[19] I feel obliged to add that my primary duty is to protect the integrity of the legal process.Although witnesses may occasionally break down, emotionally, there is a certain level of probity that is necessary to conduct a fair hearing.The legal and evidentiary process calls for a relatively calm and dispassionate assessment of the facts in a given case, and the purpose of the hearing must be respected.I have a fundamental obligation to maintain the level of decorum in the hearing that is necessary to maintain the integrity of the process.This is an indispensable attribute of the legal system and guarantees the justice and fairness of the proceeding.\n[20] The trier of fact must also be able to follow and evaluate the testimony. It must be open to intelligent inspection.The evidence must be presented in some kind of logical and coherent manner, which is capable of rational construction.There may be additional concerns in the immediate case, which relate to the obligation of a tribunal to intervene when the process endangers the psychological well-being of the Complainant.This goes directly to the capacity of the Complainant to present her case, however, and is a secondary concern.\nV. THE COMPLAINANT\u2019S ABILITY TO TESTIFY [21] The parties have come a considerable distance in discharging their burden to establish the Complainant is incapable of testifying.I have real misgivings about continuing, and doubts about whether the Complainant can participate in the hearing in a meaningful and informed manner.I am particularly concerned about whether she can deal with the rigours of cross-examination, which will have to be faced.I have allowed the Complainant considerable latitude in putting in her evidence-in-chief, but the Respondents are entitled to confront her with the details of the case in cross-examination and I see no way of sparing her from such an exercise.\n[22] Ms. Thayer submitted that Ms. Day exhibited a lack of understanding of the proceedings and made inaccurate statements of fact from the beginning of the hearing. She gave clear examples, in her estimation, of delusional thinking.There is no doubt that the Complainant\u2019s ability to recall events accurately and testify has already been brought into question. Ms. Thayer submitted that there are two major issues that have repeatedly initiated inappropriate behaviour and breaks with reality.The first is the alleged harassment.The second is her mental well-being.The Respondents accept that Ms. Day can give accurate and even compelling evidence.But that ability deteriorates rapidly when she has to deal with the events at the heart of the case.As a result, her evidence becomes untrustworthy when she deals with the essential allegations of fact.\n[23] I share the concerns of counsel.It is manifest that the Complainant\u2019s previous breakdown was triggered by her recounting of the details of her allegations.In spite of this, I am unwilling to stop the testimony at this point. It has not been established that she cannot provide a meaningful narrative of the events that led to the filing of the complaints. One of the features of the case is that it is the demands of the process that has created the conditions that led to the Complainant\u2019s breakdown.The situation is not static and the real concern is that the process of testifying may precipitate a more pronounced and prolonged breakdown.I realize that the situation is perilous for the Complainant and that counsel are not happy with the possibility that she may have a more serious episode under the strain of their questioning.This is a matter of speculation, however, and I am not satisfied that we have reached the point where I can find that she is unable to testify.\n[24] The question of capacity only arises when the cognitive abilities of the witness are fundamentally impaired.The psychiatric testimony in Hawke, for example, established that the witness in question was hallucinating on the stand.She was also accompanied, in her mind, by a little girl called Delores.This companion was, in the words of the witness, at p. 160, supra, \u201cin my head telling me to say things that would put me in jail and get tommy off\u201d.I have evidence before me that the present complainant has at least been dissociating on the stand, and that she may be moving in and out of reality.There is evidence of psychotic episodes in the past.But there is nothing of these proportions in the situation that comes before me.\n[25] As I have indicated, the Respondents have also submitted that the Complainant\u2019s psychological condition at the time when she was allegedly harassed renders her incapable of providing evidence that meets the necessary probative standard.This submission is premature, however, and relies upon a variety of factors, such as the diagnosis of her condition. Although the Complainant\u2019s testimony comes with many imperfections, the Respondents have not established the evidentiary basis for such a finding.The evidence of Dr. Kaplan was contested by the other psychological witnesses and is at least open to argument.There may be reasons to be concerned with this aspect of the testimony, but the more immediate concern is with the Complainant\u2019s present condition.\n[26] It became apparent during the voir dire that the experts have a different view as to the merits of the case.The experts for Ms. Day seem to believe that she was sexually harassed and feel that it is the sexual harassment that provided the traumatic event in the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that her experts diagnosed.The position on the other side is equally stark, however:it is that Ms. Day suffered from a paranoid personality disorder and merely believed that she was being harassed.Her perceptions have no connection to reality, on this view, and were the product of a psychological disorder.If the latter view is adopted, and the test of the courts is adopted, her evidence is so inherently unreliable that it would be dangerous to put it before a jury.The problem is that this asks me to rule on the merits of the case, in deciding the questions put before me on the voir dire.\n[27] Although I do not believe that we have reached the point where I can intervene, I believe that the present situation needs to be monitored.If the testimony of the Complainant continues to deteriorate, or it becomes impossible to conduct a proper hearing, it may be necessary to return to the question of capacity.\nV. THE COMPLAINANT\u2019S ABILITY TO PRESENT HER CASE [28] I have not been able to review the law with regard to the question whether the Complainant is capable of representing herself. The test may be whether she is capable of instructing counsel.This is not a decisive issue at this time, however, and I merely wish to address the concerns that the Respondents have raised with respect to the well-being of the Complainant.The experts who testifiedon the voir dire disagreed as to the long-term effect of Ms. Day\u2019s participation in the hearing.Dr. Hunter and Dr. Malcolm felt that it was essential, psychologically, that Ms. Day have an opportunity to see the matter through to its logical end.This may be incidental to the purpose of a hearing.I nonetheless feel that Ms. Day has a fundamental right to present her case and that the therapeutic effect of doing so is a valid consideration, in examining the rights of a complainant.\n[29] I am not as convinced as Dr. Hunter and Dr. Malcolm as to the benefit of the Complainant\u2019s participation in the hearing, and I share some of the concerns expressed by Dr. Kaplan.I do not believe, however, that it would be appropriate to intervene in the interests of the Complainant unless we reach a position where she becomes incompetent in the larger sense and cannot make decisions for herself.Up until that point, the Complainant is the only one who can decide what is in her best interests.She may make choices that run demonstrably against her interests.But that is true of anyone in society and it would be quite wrong, in my view, to treat her as a dependent.This goes directly to the legal question of dignity, which requires that tribunals and courts allow litigants to make their own decisions, however discomfiting that may be.\n[30] This is a matter of general policy.When I asked Ms. Day whether she was capable of proceeding, she was unequivocal.She feels that she can continue and advise me that she knows how to ask for help.As far as I can determine, she understands her obligations as a witness, is capable of communicating her thoughts and is generally grounded in reality.She also recognizes the need to ascertain whether her perceptions are accurate and well founded.She agreed, on my questioning, that she should not \u201cswear\u201d in the hearing room and that she is obliged to respect the other participants in the hearing.Whether she can live up to this is another matter.\n[31] The Complainant is a party to these proceedings and a finding of incapacity will probably deprive her of her right to have the complaint heard by the Tribunal.At this point, at least, I am not prepared to deprive her of that opportunity.The law of human rights is based on the dignity of the person, which requires that a tribunal respect the personal autonomy of those who come before it.This is a fundamental aspect of being a person and guarantees our freedoms.There are hazards in proceeding, and at some point, it may be necessary to intervene.But at this point, the Complainant has the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether she wishes to proceed.We have not reached the point where I can interfere with that decision.\nVI. RULING [32] I am accordingly of the view that the Complainant is capable of testifying at this point in time and can represent herself.I nevertheless have real concerns about whether she will be able to complete her case.In the circumstances, I think it is premature to rule on the application.It seems more appropriate to close the voir dire and return to the hearing, on the clear understanding that the mattermay be reopened on application by the parties.\n[33] My reading of the law, such as it is, suggests that the evidence on the voir dire may be relevant on issues like credibility and should be applied to the hearing as a whole.I would, however, invite submissions from the parties on the matter.There is also an issue of accommodation that requires consideration.\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMarch 12, 2003\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL COUNSEL OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE NOS.: T627\/1501 and T628\/1601\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:Amanda Day v.

JOYCE THAYER: Yes.\nTHE WITNESS: And I'd like to say that I'm very vulnerable to hypnosis.I would that say that for sure, if -- if somebody was looking for a subject to hypnotise, that I would be a perfect subject because at that -- I -- I am a good subject for hypnosis.\nCONTINUED BY MS. JOYCE THAYER:\nQ: Can you give me some examples of behaviour that you have come to recently recognize, or in the last little while, to recognize was induced by a hypnotic suggestion?Can you give us an example of something like that?\nA: Yes, I can.\nQ: Please do.\nA: Well, I know one (1) very strange thing was, during the employer's internal investigation, the investigator asked me about the pornography I was complaining about on the protector.\nAnd she said, well, what did you see?And I described -- well, first of all, I described what I saw when I saw the picture and the way that it made me felt (sic) was very strange.\nAnd she said, well, what did you see, or something like that.And I -- and it came out of mouth, without me knowing why I was saying it, and I even scared -- scared myself because I didn't understand why I said what I said.And I thought people were going to think that I was crazy because of what I said.\nQ: What did you say?\nA: I said, I see Helter Skelter.\nQ: And you, afterwards, understood that that was something that Robin had planted in your mind during the course of hypnosis?\nA: Well, Robin gave me instructions and he said that if -- he said that I was going to see the picture.And he said I -- I would know -- I was going to figure out which one (1) it was.He said I will know it when I see it. And when I see it, I'm going to say, I see Helter Skelter.\nFirst, he was out on the subject of movies and he says, what's the scariest movie you've ever seen?And I said, well, I -- I can't handle scary movies, I -- I saw The Exorcist but other than that, I haven't seen any scary movies, because I -- I don't enjoy them.\nAnd he --\nQ: I'm with you on that.\nA: -- said, well, what's the scariest movie you've ever heard of?And I said, Helter Skelter.And then he said, well, I see Helter Skelter.And that was confusing for us.And I couldn't figure out -- I was like, well, yeah.\nQ: What about other things, Ms. Day?\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: When did Robin say that to you, Ms. Day?\nTHE WITNESS: We were in his library.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: I mean in dates.How long ago?\nTHE WITNESS: Well, I can't remember if it was -- I think it was just after I came back from Thailand, so that was 1987, so, and it was long before -- it was just around the time that I'd met Peter, and it was a couple of years before we had Robin, so it must have been, I think, in 1987.\nCONTINUED BY MS. JOYCE THAYER:\nQ: Are there any other things that you can think of, besides your reaction to the picture, that were the result of hypnotic conditioning by Robin?\nA: Anything else that I can think of that were conditioning?\nQ: Well, your response that you later could link back to hypnotic suggestion?\nA: Yeah, there's something else I'm supposed to do, and there's something -- there's...\n(BRIEF PAUSE)\nA: Yeah, there probably is, but without going from the beginning to the end, and going through it in detail with -- maybe with my therapist or something that I probably...\nQ: But, there are other things you can --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Well, in what context, Ms. Day?\nTHE WITNESS: In what context?\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Well, did things come up in the course of the sexual harassment, or the pornography as you just described?Were there other incidents like that?Where you found yourself saying something, or doing something?Because you felt Robin had told you to do so?\nTHE WITNESS: Oh yeah.Yeah, there was another thing, yeah, happened.Oh yeah.Yeah, Robin said -- okay, no -- yeah, I want to get it -- I was going to get a message, well, I got a message and it all had to do with the -- this -- my interpretation of the information that was relayed to me during that meeting, was that I would get a message, and when I got the message, I was supposed to get into a mental institute and tell doctors and nurses about the situation.\nAnd, he said that for sure they were going to think that I was really crazy, and he said no matter what I had to go and do it -- or would I go and do it, and I said, yeah, for sure, I'm going to go.\nAnd so it became very clear that at one (1) point, when I was having the psychosis, that I had to get to the hospital, and that I was dying, and I didn't understand what that was ab -- about totally, but I guess it also had to do with the fact that I had AIDS, which is something that goes back to when I was a Hell's Angel in -- in high school.\nSo, there's that, then these things that happened in high school, I have AIDS, and then there was -- I was dying, and that was Dr. Brox, and then there was the fact that I had to go to the hospital, and tell them where the -- tell them about that.\nCONTINUED BY MS. JOYCE THAYER:\nQ: Amanda, can I ask you about the AIDS?Do you have AIDS?\nA: Well, what I'm supposed to say is my friend's standing here, and he says, my other friend over standing here, and another friend's here, and we're down in Balka (phonetic) creek, at the bridge, and ov -- behind the high school, we would go down there, and -- and people hang out there, and then I -- Matt's mom says I'm Hell's Angel, and Matt says I'm -- what I want you to do, is when you get this figured out, I want you to say, I have AIDS.\nAnd our other friends' name is Adrian (phonetic) and so I'm supposed to say I have AIDS and then he says, well, Adrian, what do you say when she says that and then Adrian says, he wants to say that it's a song by Eric Clapton, Cocaine.\nAnd I said, great, then you can be my alibi, and it's like a joke.And then -- and then we said, well, then what are you going to do?And he says, well, I'm going to go to my friend Kevin who's standing there.\nAnd Kevin's -- and then -- and then he says, Kevin Duik (phonetic) is famous.And then Matt says, go -- okay, go -- now, go and talk to Berto (phonetic) on the bridge.\nSo I go over and talk to Berto on the bridge.And the problem is, his girlfriend is getting raped and she's being turned into a prostitute and it's something to do with school.And it's -- also, it's something to do with the drama class because the teacher in drama's telling me to act like a prostitute.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: I'm having a hard time following you, Ms. Day.What are you talking about now?\nTHE WITNESS: These people got murdered later and we didn't understand this guy named Jay Kirk (phonetic) got murdered.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Let's take fifteen (15) minutes.\nTHE REGISTRAR: Order please.\nFrom pages 2980 to 2983:\nCONTINUED BY MS. JOYCE THAYER:\nQ: Were they giving you suggestions when you were being hypnotized, were they giving you suggestions that you were to act on at a later date?\nA: Well, you see, I told Peter about our day on the bridge, and that we had to go back, and we knew about Jay Kirk, and Tanya Van Tollenburg, but \u2013 and they got murdered, and Peter \u2013 and I told Peter what I knew about Jay Kirk, and Tanya Van Tollenburg, because I had been \u2013 they\u2019d been in our school, and so, Robin knew that my \u2013 we had a history of mental illness in my family, and that I had \u2013 we had discussed, you know, potentially where we might be later in life, and our cynicisms around that.\nAnd Robin suggested to me on that day, when I'm saying it was a hypnotic experience, or at least, it had that effect on me overall, it was that he said what he wanted me to do was get into a mental institute and start telling doctors and nurses all about it.\nAnd he wanted, in specific, me to tell them --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Right, and did you follow through on that at a later point?\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, I definitely did, but I --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: When?\nTHE WITNESS: -- I mean, I didn't know it was all -- what it was all about.I just knew that those were -- that was what I had to do, and I mean, subconsciously, I acted it out, but I acted out, I have AIDS, I am dying, from Dr. Brox, and -- and the things that Mr. Hortie had said to me were, and I want you to tell people that you're getting messages from other frequencies, and that you -- by the time this is, like, all the sexual harassment crap, when dockyard is over, you're going to be holding your head, and telling them that you're getting messages on different frequencies.\nSo, it was, I mean everything came -- all the stuff, all the instructions I got from different people came out, and while I hadn't been consciously aware of getting all these instructions from different people, I -- I methodically did what I was told to do, and I had no idea why I was doing it.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: So, when --\nTHE WITNESS: I --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: -- did you act out these suggestions, these commands, when did you act them out?All the way through?\nTHE WITNESS: Well, and the other thing I was supposed to say, this was from a Navy person, he said, if you want to get a message to me at Department of National Defence, I want you to say, Captain Kirk sent me in.\nNow, that makes you sound like you're a total loony when you say something like that, like -- like Captain Kirk from Star Trek sent you in, like, you sound like you're --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Did you say that?\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, I -- I was saying that on the way to the hospital.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Because you had to say that?\nTHE WITNESS: Well, the guy from the Navy, he came down to our high school, and he was talking to us, and then he said, if you ever want to get a message to me at National Defence, to say Captain Kirk sent me in.\nSo, I was saying --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Was it your --\nTHE WITNESS: -- everything that people had told me to say.It was all true stuff that people told me to say when I was at -- when I was methodically doing all these instructions I was given, I looked like a total loony.But, at the same time, I was having -- I -- I think I was having difficulty, at that time, because my health deteriorated.\nI hadn't slept for about -- like, three (3) or four (4) weeks --\nFrom pages 2989 to 2991:\nAnd so I was very calm and quiet.And then Dr. Schuldrop and the nurse were sitting there and they said -- they said something to me about Dr. Runtz.He said, is Dr. Runtz your psychologist?And I said, yes.\nAnd then all of a sudden, without me even knowing, it just seemed to come out of my mouth, like it wasn't even me talking, but I said, yeah, oink, oink, get it?\nLike, not quite in that tone of voice, I said, oink, oink, get it?\nAnd I was just, oh my God, I've just said something like -- and I hoped that they -- maybe they didn't notice that I'd said that.And I was freaking out because I thought, they're going to think that I'm crazy and they're going to keep me in here forever.\nAnd I didn't know where the hell that came from and I was just trying to stay calm and hope that they didn't notice.And then the nurse said something like, I think there was a few words there, where did those come from?\nAnd then the conversation got diverted somehow.But later I realized that I was supposed to say, oink, oink, get it, when I got in the hospital.But they'd had me drugged up so many times that, the information that I was supposed to tell them, they just kept filling me full of drugs and knocking me out that I couldn't tell them what I was supposed to tell them for going in there and -- but then I didn't even know, like, what it was about and why the hell I was supposed to tell them that.\nQ: Who told you to tell them that?\nA: Robin and Peter and -- and it was -- and it was -- they said it was really, really, really important and I was laughing at the time and going oh my god, like, get out of here, that's so stupid and Peter got really mad.\nHe said no, this is really important and Robin was getting really upset in the kitchen and he was yelling from the kitchen at Peter who was in a different room and I was in a different room.\nWe were all in different rooms of the house and that's why it was so weird and Robin was yelling from the kitchen saying this is really important and Peter is going, it is?Okay, okay, okay.I'll do it again.\nSo then he did it again.He goes \"Oink, oink.Get it?\" and he did that like four (4) or five (5) times and finally I just said okay, okay, okay, okay, I get it.\nAnd so -- and then I just forgot about it but then when I ended up in the hospital I was sitting on the couch and then it came out of my mouth \"Oink, oink. Get it.\" and it was just like, where the hell did that come from?Like, and I didn't know, like, for about -- I didn't realize for honestly a couple years after that that was related to my meeting with Robin and Peter and I at that time.\nSo it was -- it was just like my brain just burps up stuff that's in there and I can't control it.It just comes out.It's real stuff and it's related to an event but I don't always know why it's coming out at the time.\nFrom pages 2996 to 3000:\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Did the same thing happen with Mr. Hortie?\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah. Oh yeah. He was totally giving me directions on what he wanted me to do, and he was using suggestion in order to manipulate my behaviour. There is no question.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019d like to hear more about that.\nMS. JOYCE THAYER: Yeah.\nCONTINUED BY MS. JOYCE THAYER:\nQ: Could you give us specific examples of that, Ms. Day?Things that you acted upon, because of suggestions that were given to you by Mr. Hortie?\nA: Yeah.It's hard, because I'd have to, kind of, chase it around in my head for a bit.\nQ: Well, I'll give you a minute, and just think about it.\nA: I know that at one (1) point, he said to me that he knew that I was going through the harassment in the dockyard and he said that -- that he knew I was going to be really crying the blues over it and he said I was going to experience a lot of grief.And he said that I would likely be playing and singing a song which was -- it's a Beatles song -- I can't remember the words.\nLittle darling, it's all right.Just -- the sun will come out or something.\nQ: And what was the context in which you would be singing that song?\nA: He said the context of it would be that I would be having so much grief from the harassment that sooner or later I would find myself playing that song and grieving.\nQ: Did that happen?\nA: It did.I can finger pick that song perfectly and I can hardly even play the guitar.\nQ: So that was a message that Mr.Hortie implanted in your mind that you acted on later?\nA: Yeah.But I -- the funny thing about it was that I actually didn't realise why I was doing that and why I had achieved that until a couple of years after the fact -- that I was doing -- that I was playing that exact song and that I was able to finger pick and play that song because I can't finger pick and play any other songs other than the ones that my guitar teacher taught me when I was a teenager.\nQ: What other types of things can you recall that Mr. Hortie implanted in your mind that you acted on later?\nA: He said that there was probably going to be a situation where we didn't see each other for a long time or that we weren't going to be able to communicate together.\nSo, what he wanted me to do was to say the word credence, and that was going to be -- that was going to -- when -- in some situations where we weren't going to be able to talk to each other that I was going to say the word credence.\nQ: Did that happen?\nA: Well, yes, it did.\nQ: Can you explain?\nA: I was in a conference call with the Tribunal and I was hearing Mr. Hortie's voice in the conference call for the first time.I hadn't talked -- I hadn't heard Mr. Hortie on the phone or in person for quite a few years.\nAnd all of a sudden I regurgitated the word credence, and there was talk about the medical -- the medical information and I said I'm not sure if that person has credence.And then I said -- I was having trouble saying my words and then I said, well, I think it's credentials or something.But then I realised after that, like, that I realised that I just regurgitated something.\nQ: When did Mr. Hortie tell you that?\nA: It was sometime when he said that we had to get to know each other on a very deep level.Then he had to share -- he -- I had to share personal information with him and he was giving me, kind of, this instruction about I was supposed to say the word credence.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Ms. Day, I wonder if I can come in here.Is it fair to say, Ms.Day, so that -- you were in your view you were programmed to say that?Can I put it that way?\nTHE WITNESS: Well, I think I -- I think I have a tendency to just about do whatever.Like -- like --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Just to help me out, just try and stay with --\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, I would say I was programmed.But like, I'm just telling you that I have a problem and I have a real tendency.Like, my teachers -- I've had situations in -- in the classroom where teachers ask questions and I can answer within three (3) seconds.\nFrom page 3002:\nQ: Let's not worry about those kinds of things.Let's worry about the things where [Mr.Hortie] actually programmed you to do things, Ms. Day.\nSo you said, some of the things he programmed you to do were sexual.Tell us about some of those things.\nA: I don't think I want to.I know he said that -- he said that, by the time the experience was over, that I was going to be holding my head and telling people that I was hearing things on different frequencies.\nFrom pages 3004 to 3006:\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Are you saying you were doing what you were programmed to do on a conscious level?\nTHE WITNESS: I guess Mr. Hortie was basically programming me on a conscious level but he -- I mean, he was able to use these hypnotic suggestions to program me to do things subconsciously but as far as my psyche and my internal workings of my subconscious, he would have a very hard time to get control of that.\nMS. JOYCE THAYER: Can we just --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: No --\nCONTINUED BY MS. JOYCE THAYER:\nQ: You're talking about the difference between your conscious and your subconscious here and when you say that Mr. Hortie and other people programmed you, I take it you're saying they're programming your subconscious?\nIt's not something that you're aware of but later it happens and you think back and you retrieve it out of your subconscious memory?Is that right, Ms. Day?\nA: Well, I'm almost wondering if, like, programming is a kind of strong way to say.I mean, it boils down to intent.\nI have to be honest with you, I don't feel that, like, when my friends have suggested to me that they want me to remember certain key phrases or messages and things, that they're trying to do something harmful or hurt me, but I think that the way that Mr. Hortie is trying to use -- trying to use the hypnotic suggestions and to prog -- I'm saying that Mr. Hortie is very harmful and he is intentionally trying to manipulate me with that kind of -- with exactly that kind of --\nQ: And --\nA: -- suggestion and mental manipulation --\nQ: And --\nA: -- and I'm a person that I will -- I'm -- I'm -- I am a perfect target for a manipulator like that.\nQ: So you're saying that he was able to implant in your subconscious things that you had to act on years later?For instance, when you blurted out the word credence in the course of the conference call?\nA: Hmm hmm and holding my head and saying that I was getting information on different frequencies.\nQ: When did you do that?\nA: On my way to the hospital.I had called Kevin Duik to find out if he was famous and -- and then I was regurgitating all this stuff and that was one of the things that came out and later when I traced it back and I realized that that was -- it was -- the source of it was Mr. Hortie.\nFrom pages 3018 to 3020:\nCONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. JOYCE THAYER:\nQ: Ms. Day, when we left off yesterday we were talking about the fact that some of the things that you've done over the course of time has been as a result of suggestions that have been implanted in your subconscious by a number of different people.\nAnd you've told us about suggestions that were implanted by Dr. Brox, by some of your friends when you were on the bridge, when you were age fifteen (15), by Robin who was the Hell's Angel and by Mr. Hortie.\nWere there any other individuals that you can recall in your life, that have given you the same type of suggestions that you've eventually acted on, and had to reconstruct what happened?\nA: Yes, there have.\nQ: Could you tell us about those, please?\nA: When I was a young child, my grandma and my aunt and my mother took me to a church in Calgary.And there was a whole bunch of kids there and we had to see a priest and the priest was talking to us and I was very young.\nAnd he asked if there would be any volunteers, and I was one (1) of the kids that put up my hand.And he wrote my name down on a list. And he told us that what he wanted us to do is that if we knew where there was a very, very bad man, that we were going to be able to talk to God.\nAnd what he wanted us to do was to look up at the window on the left, up in the church.And when we look up there, then we'll know that God is talking to us and that when we need to tell people where there is a really bad, bad man, that we can tell those people that God is talking to us and God is telling us what to do.\nAnd he said that he wanted us to know that, something like, these things are very difficult but we needed to feel safe in ourselves that we -- that we could be a voice for God.\nQ: And when did you act upon what you were told by the priest as a small child?\nA: Well, I know that when I had my grievance hearing with Captain Blattman he didn't believe that I'd been sexually harassed and he started asking me all kinds of really, really, really stupid questions that were just really antagonizing.\nAnd I remember that I was really scared that after they were going to think I was crazy because I remember looking up to the left and then looking at Captain Blattman and saying squarely to Captain Blattman, and because God is telling me to, because God was telling me to make the complaint.\nBut then, I think my union representative was a little bit disturbed about the fact that I'd said something like that and I was, kind of, disturbed about it myself.And I didn't -- it took me over a year to realize where that -- where that statement I had made was coming from because it was something that I was told to do when I was a very small child and I did it without thinking of it.\nBut when -- it made me look like I was crazy but when -- and then it took me a long time to figure out why I had said that God was telling me to tell them that.\nFrom pages 3043 to 3047:\nCONTINUED BY MS. JOYCE THAYER:\nQ: Ms. Day, can you tell us about those situations where Mr. Hortie challenged your perceptions in a way that made you feel crazy?\nA: Yeah.I mean, he did that on a day -- on a daily basis.I think every contact I had with Mr. Hortie was -- was manipulative to the extent that he -- he took my perception of the situation which was standing upright, as an analogy, and he took it and flipped it upside down and told me that it was actually this way, which was his way, and I mean, if I said something's white, he would say, no, that is black.\nIt was that -- it was that distinct.\nQ: Did it make you feel crazy or question your own --\nA: It put me in a situation where I was constantly having to reality test myself.I was constantly have -- I was in crisis all the time because my perception was upside down.I was going to work and going home.It was like -- it's like if -- it's as if I was walking around upside down and I was seeing the whole world upside down.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Tell me \u2013\nTHE WITNESS: It was \u2013\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Tell me more about \u2013\nTHE WITNESS: It was totally \u2013\nTHE CHAIRPERSON:-- this, Ms. Day.\nTHE WITNESS:-- confusing.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Ms. Day, I want to hear more about this. Can you give us examples?\nTHE WITNESS: Everything. Just everything.\nCONTINUED BY MS. JOYCE THAYER:\nQ: Well, just give us a specific example. I know that it was very persuasive but there must be some things that stand out as particularly challenging or that you just couldn\u2019t believe after you reality checked that he had suggested that?\nA: Well, just the fact that \u2013 just the fact that he could touch my body without my permission was \u2013 flipped my reality upside down. Okay? The fact that he could physically touch me, shove his tongue in my mouth, put his penis into my body \u2013 into my mouth, into my vagina and into my bottom, the fact that he was allowed \u2013 he allowed himself to do those things against my will and without my permission and the fact that he could even just touch me. Like \u2013 like that was enough.\nQ: What are you --\nA: After a while it was just like this much of a touch was, like -- I felt like my whole body was on fire.Like, I felt like a burn victim.Even just -- and just anybody.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON:And you're touching yourself very lightly?\nTHE WITNESS:Anybody just even coming within my body space touching me like that felt like -- I felt like a burn victim.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: What do you mean that it flipped your -- what was the term? Flipped your sense of reality?\nCONTINUED BY MS. JOYCE THAYER:\nQ: You said you felt like you were walking upside down all the time?\nA: Yeah.It felt -- it -- the way -- the way my mind felt from what he was doing was that, like, I was -- my world used to be normal.I used to see -- like, I used to see people normally.Like you're all upright but the way that my mind felt when Mr. Hortie was harassing me, I felt like I was seeing everything upside down.Like, that was how -- sorry for swearing.I'm not going to swear.\nQ: Right.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Say what you want to say.\nTHE WITNESS:I felt so fucked up in my head because the way Mr. Hortie painted my perception of things and interpreted -- he interpreted all my perceptual data and told me what was happening in the work place and in my -- in my own personal life that I was reality testing myself --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: And you're saying he had it all wrong?\nTHE WITNESS: He had it all -- he was telling me everything all upside down but that's the only way I can explain it to you.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Was it only Mr. Hortie or was it other people as well?\nTHE WITNESS: No, it was only Mr. Hortie.I mean, there were -- but then there were circumstantial things from people in the work place which supported what Mr. Hortie was telling me was happening to me.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: So how did you deal with that?So you mean you --\nTHE WITNESS: It -- it has definitely in -- influenced me and it's -- it made me feel like I was completely unable to -- to get out of the situation.I felt trapped because there were circumstantial things which were _- that were very solid evidence that, in fact, I couldn't get help and that I had to conform to the conditions which were being placed on my employment.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Ms. Thayer, there's an important question and I think I should ask it.And I know this is difficult for you, Ms. Day.But did you not consider the possibility that the problem was in your mind?\nTHE WITNESS: Of course I considered the prob -- that the problem was in my mind, that's part of reality testing.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: So, tell me --\nTHE WITNESS: Because all this stuff was happening and I -- I -- after awhile I got so messed up, that's a better word, I got so messed up that I -- like, I mean, I was getting messed up from the very beginning.Let's just say, I was getting really, really messed up from the very beginning.\nBut I got so severely messed up -- I got so severely messed up that I could just -- I was just -- I felt like I was a carcass.I felt like a dead body, I was completely numb.I mean, I was numb from the beginning, but I'm talking about really, really, really numb.Like -- like, I felt like I'd been injected with anaesthetics, I was so numb.I had no feelings.I had not one (1) iota of a feeling.\nAnd that was by Sept -- like, October of '94, when I was back working in the shop in Building 190.I was just -- I was a dead body walking around.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: And what happened, Ms. Day?Did it get better or worse?\nTHE WITNESS: Well, I just -- I thought, well, I'm going to go right out on a limb.And I told Rod Lundgren that I had to get to a psychologist and that I, you know, if they could -- if they could get a psychologist for me that I'd really appreciate it.\nAnd I -- like, I'm really sorry but I'm obviously such -- I'm obviously, you know, I need a shrink right away because I am seriously a messed up person and I cannot function.\nI mean, and I recognized that I -- that I was -- I mean I was like, flat. Normally, in a day, a person has -- like we go through a range of emotions.In -- in an hour you can have -- I don't know how many emotions you could experience, five (5) or six (6) significant emotions in an hour, just through your natural thoughts or whatever.\nBut, you know -- you know, you'd be up and down, up and down, up and down.But I was like, flat.I didn't feel anything.I was like a -- I was a dead body. And it was just like, you know, I am obviously so crazy because my -- I know I'm being harassed here, and I know all this stuff is happening, but this guy is telling me things like, well, if anybody asks you about my problems, just tell them that we're going to get married, and things like that.\nAnd then the threats and then -- and then, as I started talk -- as people were talking to me in the workplace, the physical threats, that he was going to hurt other people, or he was going to hurt me.\nAnd I still didn't know where this gun was, you know. He's going to blow off his own head and he's going to do it in my house.This was all really scary stuff.And, yeah, I doubted-- I -- it's a -- I think it's a natural, healthy process.If you're not reality testing yourself, you -- if a person isn't reality testing themself, then those are the kind of people that you see in the hospital.\nAnd the fact that I was thinking of myself, that I might be crazy, I think that's an indication that I was really healthy.But I was really, really messed up. And I had to get -- and that's why I asked if I could go to see -- get a psychologist.\nADDITIONAL EXCERPT\nFrom pages 3077 to 3080:\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: But what you need to address is your ability to give evidence. And the problem is that you said a number of things which make it quite clear that you have difficulty distinguishing between your perceptions and reality.\nMS. AMANDA DAY: I don't think I --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: And that those perceptions --\nMS. AMANDA DAY: -- have problems distinguishing between my perceptions and reality.I think, it's clear that the employer has a hazing process, and it's clear that my perceptions were painted by Mr. Hortie.And clearly, when you open up the voir dire, and I understand that there are issues of competence and there are legal issues, which I don't understand.\nBut when people -- I mean, even when people are telling me that they feel that I'm paranoid and delusional, then it influences my perception to the point that I have to question myself, whether or not I am paranoid and delusional.\nSo it's like the Hydenberg (phonetic) uncertainty principle, you -- you can't measure one (1) thing and you can't be certain of the position of one (1) thing, when -- when you're trying to do something else.\nAnd it becomes a very difficult situation to cope with.And I'm telling you that, my perception of reality is valid.And your perception of reality is yours. And yours is different and mine is different; that doesn't mean that mine is wrong or that I'm impaired.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: I think I'm in the position where I have to assume that some of what you told us, happened in your mind rather than in reality.\nMS. AMANDA DAY: Well, I think that definitely what this person -- what Mr. Hortie did to me, was to get my mind messed up in such a way that he was able to carry out these sexual abuse and sexual assaults and sexual harassment.\nAnd that's clear, that there were several things said to me, and that he manip -- manipulated my perception and that he -- Mr. Hortie impaired my perception at the time.\nBut I'm telling you that, now, I'm aware that those things were happening and that I know why I was having so much difficulty.I'm not saying that I'm still having those problems now, which is fundamentally different from the fact that I'm aware of what was happening at the time, in retrospect.\n(BRIEF PAUSE)\nMS. AMANDA DAY: However, I, myself, I -- I'm left to question whether or not I'm still subject to influences of directions that I've been given by Mr. Hortie, suggestive suggestions.I'm not sure how suicidal I may be, I'm not sure how harmful I may be to myself.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: I'm concerned about that, Ms. Day.\nMS. AMANDA DAY: Yes, and I'm concerned about it, too.And when I went home yesterday, I started to be -- trying to think and trying to figure out what's, you know -- because I think that's the other thing that people like that do, is that they mess you up so much, they -- they can even, you know, kind of predict a future path for you.\nAnd, I mean, he was telling me things like, the harassment was going to make me feel -- I was going to feel so, so, so much grief over the fact that I was being harassed by all these people. When he was the one (1) who was painting my perception and telling me that nobody liked me and nobody wanted to work with me.\nSo those are things that have been coming to fruition over the course of time, that I haven't understood.But they've been suggested to me by -- to me by Mr. Hortie.So I'm left to wonder, well, I don't know what else he planted in my mind.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Did you --\nMS. AMANDA DAY: And whether or not I'm suicidal is another -- is another consideration for -- for a victim of this kind.If you have to consider, I suppose, that there -- that there is a serious danger that I may --\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Did you talk to --\nMS.

The objection is that the Complainant signed a full release with respect to the matter now before the Tribunal. The present controversy concerns the question whether the objection should be dealt with prior to the hearing or after the evidence has been heard.\n[2] It is agreed that the Complainant suffered a nervous breakdown while he was employed by the Halifax Port Authority and was subsequently dismissed. The employer states that the dismissal was for just cause. The complaint alleges that this constituted discrimination on the basis of disability under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Respondent goes further, however, and argues that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to proceed with an inquiry, since the Complainant signed a settlement agreement covering the matter. This agreement apparently contained a release stating that the Respondent has satisfied its obligations under the Canada Labour Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[3] The Human Rights Commission originally declined to deal with the complaint under section 41(1)(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, on the basis that the Complainant had entered into the settlement. This was reviewed in the Federal Court, in Brine v. Canada (Attorney General), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1439 (Q.L.), which returned the matter to the Commission. Justice Lemieux found that the Commission had failed to consider a report on the Complainant\u2019s psychological condition by Mr. Dunphy, one of its own investigators. In paragraph 44 of the report, the Investigator wrote:\nEvidence provided by the Complainant\u2019s psychologist shows that the Complainant was not emotionally capable of representing his interests when he signed the settlement.\nThe Commission and Complainant are apparently now taking the position that the Complainant was unable to sign a binding release as a result of his psychological incapacity.\n[4] The Commission and Complainant have argued that the Tribunal is not in a position to determine the validity of the settlement without a full evidentiary record. The Commission submits that the Tribunal:\n\u2026 cannot decide the ultimate fate of this complaint by way of a preliminary motion without \u2026 hearing the entire evidence related to the complaint.\nThe Respondent demurs. It argues that the proper approach is to have a separate hearing to deal with the release issue, including evidence and argument, before the inquiry commences. This could also be dealt with in a voir dire at the outset of the hearing.\n[5] In its submissions, the Commission suggests that the ruling from the Federal Court requires the Tribunal to decide the issue concerning the release after hearing the merits of the case. I do not follow the logic of such an argument. The ruling from the Federal Court deals specifically with the responsibilities of the Commission, which was established as an investigatory body with a mandate to pursue the resolution of complaints. At paragraph 39, Justice Lemieux holds that the Commission is an administrative and screening body with no appreciable adjudicative role. The function of the Commission is somewhat analogous to that of a judge at a preliminary inquiry. It was not established to try the case and does not have the authority to decide the matters that would normally come before a tribunal.\n[6] The real issue before the Federal Court was whether the Commission had rejected the complaint without considering the evidence and circumstances before it. The Commission is not making the same kind of determination as the Tribunal, however, and cannot adjudicate the matter. If the decision from the Federal Court is significant before me, it is primarily because it establishes that there is a litigious issue between the parties on the settlement. In such a situation, it seems plain that a tribunal cannot determine whether the release is binding without a full evidentiary record. When I say this, I simply mean the full evidentiary record necessary to decide the issue. Whether this requires a full hearing of the case is open to debate.\n[7] I am not as comfortable as the Respondent with its characterization of the matter as a question of jurisdiction, though the term jurisdiction has been used with considerable abandon in the caselaw. The basic position of the Respondent is nonetheless compelling. It seems unfair to enter into a full hearing when it is unclear whether there is a legal dispute, a lis, between the parties. The Respondent relies on the decision in Chow v. Mobile Oil Canada, [1999] A.J. No. 949 (Q.L.) (Alta. Q.B.), where the Court holds, at paragraph 100, that a similar issue before a Board of Inquiry raises a jurisdictional issue. It was therefore necessary to decide the issue before embarking on the hearing of the complaint. The Respondent argues, on the strength of this, that the present Tribunal cannot enter into an inquiry without hearing and resolving the objection.\n[8] As I have said, I am inclined to think that the jurisdictional notion is overstated. Even if the release goes to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to proceed, the Tribunal appears to have some latitude in the matter. In Mohawk Council of Kahnawake v. Jacobs, 1996 F.C.J. No. 757 (Q.L.), the Federal Court reviewed a decision of a Tribunal to hear all of the evidence in the case before deciding a jurisdictional issue. Justice Tremblay-Lamer held that the Tribunal is master of its own proceedings and refused to intervene. There are cases outside the federal arena that adopt the same position, such as Newfoundland (Human Rights Commission) v. Newfoundland (Department of Health), [1998] N.J. No. 129 (N.C.A.).\n[9] It follows that the Tribunal has the discretion to deal with the question concerning the settlement before or after the hearing, on the basis of what seems best in the circumstances before it. Although it is not available to me, I suspect that the present situation could be resolved by an order for security of costs in the civil courts. Should it become apparent at the end of the case that a hearing was unnecessary, the Respondent would at least have the comfort of knowing that it would receive some compensation for its pains. This is not possible in the human rights process, since the general consensus is that a Respondent is not entitled to costs. This may result in an unfairness. It is all very easy for the Complainant and the Commission to insist that all of the evidence be heard, when they know that the other party will have to bear so much of the freight.\n[10] There is a related issue under section 48.9(1) of the Act, which states that proceedings (l\u2019instruction des plaintes) before the Tribunal shall be conducted as expeditiously (se fait . . . de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive) as possible in the circumstances. I think that this prescription applies as much to procedural and preliminary matters as to the hearing on the merits of the case. The Tribunal\u2019s empowering legislation accordingly supports the notion that a case should be decided summarily, if it is possible to do so. The Respondent may not be entitled to costs, or security for costs; it is nevertheless entitled to a prompt and efficient resolution of the matter. The Tribunal should be careful not to penalize a respondent by prolonging a case beyond its natural duration.\n[11] There are reasons to believe, moreover, that issues relating to releases are inherently preliminary. This is evident in the caselaw under the Rules of Court in the various provinces. In Sinclair-Cockburn Insurance Brokers Ltd. v. Richards [2002] O.J. No. 3288 (Q.L.), for example, the Ontario Court of Appeal dealt with a rather confusing set of facts arising out of a fraudulent bond. At paragraph 14, the Court held as follows:\nAs Mr. Cadsby, counsel for Wiggins, said during oral argument, his client paid a substantial sum of money to buy peace, not just peace from potential liability for a judgment, but peace from even having to respond to a claim from Richards. Sinclair-Cockburn signed an unqualified release. Wiggins is entitled to all the benefits that flow from that release, which include its reputational interest and its interest in not being dragged into a lawsuit.\nThe strength of this rationale may vary from case to case. It nonetheless brings in a set of interests that militates strongly in favour of an early settlement of the issues that arise as a result of a settlement between the parties.\n[12] The present ruling does not go to the substance of the motion. That is intentional. The Complainant and Commission may want to argue that it is impractical to separate the issue regarding the settlement from the other issues in the case. I say this because they appear to be taking the position that the Complainant\u2019s psychological difficulties deprived him of his ability to enter into a binding agreement. If that is their position, there is an obvious argument that it will be impossible to determine whether the settlement is binding without hearing evidence on the nature and extent of his disability. It may also be necessary to hear evidence with respect to the events that originally gave rise to the complaint. The issue is accordingly whether it is feasible to sever the issue regarding the settlement from the other issues in the case.\n[13] The submissions before me do not address this issue. The matter will have to be dealt with at the beginning of the hearing, at which time I would invite counsel to advise me whether they feel it is possible to separate the issue regarding the release from the other issues in the case. I agree with the Respondent that it is preferable to decide the settlement issue, if that is possible, before proceeding further. The integrity of the hearing should be preserved as much as possible, however, and I do not see any reason to deal with this in a separate application. In the circumstances of the case, I think it is better to proceed by way of a voir dire. If it becomes apparent on hearing the evidence that the settlement is not binding, the evidence on the voir dire can then be applied to the hearing as a whole.\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nApril 29, 2003\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE NO.: T758\/0803\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Bruce Brine v.

INTRODUCTION [1] Richard Warman is a lawyer in Ottawa. On February 2, 2002, Mr. Warman filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against Fred Kyburz. Mr. Warman's complaint alleged that Mr. Kyburz communicated messages through his Internet web site, messages which expose identifiable groups to hatred or contempt, in violation of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Mr. Warman's complaint was subsequently amended, with leave of the Tribunal, to include the allegation that Mr. Kyburz retaliated against Mr. Warman for having filed his human rights complaint, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act. This retaliation is alleged to have occurred through the use of Mr. Kyburz' e-mail account and web forum.\nII. FAILURE OF FRED KYBURZ TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING [2] Mr. Kyburz did not appear at the hearing into Mr. Warman's complaint, nor did anyone acting for Mr. Kyburz appear on his behalf. The record discloses that Mr. Kyburz was personally served with information relating to the complaint. The documents served upon Mr. Kyburz included the Notice of Hearing, which indicated the dates and location of the hearing. Shortly after this material was served on Mr. Kyburz, the documents were returned to the Tribunal, with the notation returned for fraud and lack of jurisdiction written across the top page, followed by what appears to be Mr. Kyburz' signature.(1) Mr. Kyburz also sent the Tribunal a document entitled Copyright Notice, relating to the name Ernst-Friedrich Kyburz.\n[3] The Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. Kyburz had notice of Mr. Warman's complaint and of the hearing in this matter. This finding is confirmed by the material downloaded from Mr. Kyburz' web forum, which makes it abundantly clear that Mr. Kyburz was aware of the hearing, and elected not to participate in the process.\nIII. THE ISSUES [4] Insofar as Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint is concerned, there are three issues that must be considered in determining whether the complaint has been made out:(2)\nDid Mr. Kyburz communicate, or cause to be communicated, repeatedly, the messages found at the web site in issue? Were these messages communicated in whole or in part by means of a telecommunications undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament? and Is the subject matter of the messages likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination?\n[5] The Tribunal must also determine whether Mr. Kyburz retaliated or threatened retaliation against Mr. Warman for having filed his original section 13 complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, contrary to the provisions of section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[6] In the event that either or both aspects of the complaint are substantiated, the issue of the appropriate remedy will also have to be addressed.\nIV. THE SECTION 13 COMPLAINT A. Did Mr. Kyburz Communicate, or Cause to be Communicated, Repeatedly, the Messages Found at the Web Site in Issue? [7] Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint relates to a web site located at the www.patriotsonguard.org web address. During his testimony, Mr. Warman identified numerous documents that he had downloaded from this site. These consist of a copy of the site's home page, as well as numerous Daily Information Pages (or DIPs). The home page describes the mission of Patriots on Guard, and states that the web page is presented by Fred Kyburz of Coleman, Alberta. Each DIP starts with a welcoming message, which includes a solicitation to subscribe to a monthly Patriots on Guard newsletter. Subscription fees are to be sent to Fred Kyburz, General Delivery, Blairmore Post Office, Blairmore, Alberta.\n[8] Mr. Warman testified that he performed a search at the www.register.com web site, which, he explained, will provide the name of the registrant of a particular web address. The results of that search disclose that the registered owner of the www.patriotsonguard.org web site was Fred Kyburz, General Delivery, Blairmore Post Office, Blairmore, Alberta.\n[9] Based upon the evidence before us, the Tribunal finds that Fred Kyburz controlled the www.patriotsonguard.org web site. The Tribunal is further satisfied that Mr. Kyburz caused the materials found on the site to be communicated. The fact that a web site is a somewhat passive medium, requiring the reader to take positive steps in order to access the posted material does not detract from the fact that, in up-loading the material to the web site, Mr. Kyburz communicated the material in issue. (3)\n[10] The final matter to be considered is the element of repetition. The extent to which these messages were disseminated is a testament to the effectiveness of the Internet as a communications tool. The Patriots on Guard web site has a visitor counter. As of the time when Mr. Warman downloaded the page on September 10, 2001, 61,370 visitors had accessed the Patriots on Guard site.\n[11] We are therefore satisfied that Mr. Kyburz communicated, or caused to be communicated, repeatedly, the messages found at the web site in issue.\nB. Were These Messages Communicated in Whole or in Part by Means of a Telecommunications Undertaking Within the Legislative Authority of Parliament? [12] The messages which form the subject matter of Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint are those that appear on the Patriots on Guard web site. The last such message is dated December 21, 2001, and appears to have been downloaded by Mr. Warman that same day.\n[13] As will be explained in greater detail further on in this decision, Mr. Warman complained about the content of the Patriots on Guard web site to Mr. Kyburz' Internet service provider, causing the service provider to withdraw service. Mr. Warman testified that the Patriots on Guard web site was shut down permanently some time in late December of 2001 or early January of 2002.\n[14] It is not entirely clear which version of section 13 governs the Patriots on Guard web site. The Canadian Human Rights Act, as it was originally enacted, did not explicitly deal with Internet communications. This is not surprising, in that section 13 was originally enacted in 1977, well before the Internet came into our lives on a regular basis. As part of the changes to Canadian law effected by the proclamation of the Anti-Terrorism Act (4) on December 24, 2001, the Canadian Human Rights Act was amended to add the following provision to subsection 13(2):\nFor greater certainty, subsection (1) applies in respect of a matter that is communicated by means of a computer or a group of interconnected or related computers, including the Internet, or any similar means of communication ...\n[15] Ultimately, however, it does not matter whether any communication by Mr. Kyburz took place after the amendments to the legislation(5). The earlier version of section 13 has been found to encompass Internet communications in Citron et al. v. Z\u00fcndel(6), and we adopt the reasoning of the Tribunal in that case.\nC. Is the Subject Matter of the Messages Likely to Expose a Person or Persons to Hatred or Contempt by Reason of the Fact That They are Identifiable on the Basis of a Prohibited Ground of Discrimination? (i) What is the Subject Matter of the Messages Communicated by Mr. Kyburz? [16] In order to put the messages in issue into context, it is helpful to review the self-described mission of Patriots on Guard. According to the web site's home page, Patriots on Guard: ... is an organization dedicated to alerting the public about travesties against people's rights and freedoms, specifically by the courts and law enforcement agencies in Canada, and worldwide. This is done through the use of the DIPs. Most of the DIPs consist of copies of articles obtained from other sources, followed by an editorial comment. These editorial comments are frequently written in the first person, and appear to be the work of Mr. Kyburz.\n[17] The focus of many of the early DIPS is on the supposed misdeeds of Ashkenazi Jews.(7) For example, the October 22, 2000 DIP contains several articles from what appears to be a Syrian news web site, each of which deals with aggression and terrorist acts allegedly committed by the State of Israel. These articles are followed by a commentary by Mr. Kyburz, wherein he explains his understanding of the difference between what he calls blood Jews or Sephardic Jews, and Ashkenazi Jews. Ashkenazi Jews, who Mr. Kyburz says comprise about 90% of the world's Jewish population, are not real Jews, but chose Judaism as a faith sometime in the 13th century.\n[18] Mr. Kyburz states that he is not an anti-Semite, but rather is writing in order to clarify misunderstandings some people have about Jews. He goes on to say:\nI am not against Jews. I am against some of the practices of these Ashkenazi Jews. They are the ones who propagate all the violence. They are the ones who are the driving force behind the United Nations. They are the designers of our present usurious money system that brings so much hardships [sic] and destruction. They are the ones in control of the mainstream media disseminating lies and misinformation. They are the ones who are in control of the filth in the movie industry. Communism, terrorism, war and Ashkenazi Jew are synonymous.\nMr. Kyburz further states:\nAgain I want to repeat that there are decent Jews, even Ashkenazi Jews. We have to be careful not to attack the Jews but their nefarious actions, and to expose the particular individuals who commit such nefarious actions. We also have to go after their mindless lackeys, the people in government who don't think twice to implement their murderous plans.\n[19] A similar sentiment is expressed in the October 24, 2000 DIP. Commenting on an article entitled The 'English' Jew behind the foundation of Israel, Mr. Kyburz writes Isn't it amazing that war is always traced back to Ashkenazis who are falsely called Jews. Wherever they are involved deceit, treachery and murder run rampant.\n[20] On October 25, 2000, Mr. Kyburz published an article written by William Pierce, entitled There will be Hell to pay. This is a lengthy article - one quite remarkable in the level of vitriol that it directs at Jews. The article deals with a number of issues, including the White-slave trade supposedly operated by Jews. Pierce states that the White-slave business flourishes in Israel because in that country slavery is not illegal, as long as the slaves aren't Jews. White-slavery is, in fact, sanctioned by the Jewish religion.\n[21] Pierce also discusses Jewish involvement in child pornography, referring to the break-up of a child pornography ring in Moscow, which ring was allegedly run by three Jews. He describes the activities of the pornographers in the following terms:\nChild pornography is an almost unimaginably filthy business. I'm not talking about videos of well-developed 15- or 16-year-old girls having sex. I'm talking about things so perverse and sickening that most Americans can't imagine them. I'm talking about men being filmed having sex with two- and three-year-old girls. I'm talking about small children - White children - being sexually tortured and raped to death in front of the camera for the titillation of the sick freaks who are sexually excited by such horrors.\n[22] As to the 'sick freaks', that is, the consumers of the child pornography, Pierce states that The freaks, I am sorry to say are not all Jews, although Jews are disproportionately represented among them.\n[23] Pierce goes on to explain the fact that there was no coverage of these events in the American media, as a result of Jewish control over the media.\n[24] What is to be done about the people engaged in these pornographic activities? Pierce states that [his] view is that such people should simply be killed on the spot whenever and wherever they are found. Having previously identified Jews as being in control of the media, he goes on to say: More than that, the people who promote and encourage this extreme individualist mind-set through their control of the media should be exterminated root and branch as a class.\n[25] Pierce does not, however, limit his comments to the killing of Jews engaged in child pornography and media control, but actually suggests that the elimination of all of the Jews in Russia would be justified:\nThe Jews bled Russia dry with 70 years of Marxist rule and murdered tens of millions of Russians - the best Russians - in the communist slave labour camps or in the basement of the secret police headquarters or beside the shooting pits in forests all over Russia and Ukraine; they have forced thousands of the prettiest young Russian women into prostitution and slavery after the fall of communism; and now they kidnap Russian children and rape them to death in front of the camera in order to make child-porn films for rich perverts in the West. The Jews are lucky they still control most of the television and other mass media in Russia - because if the Russian people ever are fully awakened to what the Jews are still doing to them, they will rise up and kill every Jew in Russia - every Jew - and they will be fully justified in doing so.\n[26] While acknowledging that not all Jews are engaged in child pornography, Pierce posits that all Jews should be held to account for these horrible atrocities, as ... the ones who don't run the child-porn business cover for the ones who do.\n[27] While it does not appear that Fred Kyburz was the author of this article, section 13 of the Act does not require authorship. The discriminatory practice is made out when a respondent communicates matter that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, whether or not the respondent wrote the material himself.\n[28] As with the previous DIPs, Mr. Kyburz offers his own commentary regarding the article he published on his web site. What does he have to say about the Pierce article? He says:\nI would like to mention that the Jews who engage in these atrocities are not 'real' Jews. They are the Ashkenazi Jews which [sic] took the Jewish faith for political reasons as we have seen in the previous DIP. I will refer to them in the future simply as Ashkenazis. They are frauds. They are the ones who brought communism into being. They are the ones concocting the many ways of sickening people throughout the world. They are the ones who created the usurious money system in order to bleed us dry. They are the ones who are in control of WHO. They are the ones who push the vaccines to make us sick and dependant on their pharmaceutical corporations. They are the ones controlling the United Nations. Is it any surprise that the United Nations is a murderous outfit? They are the ones dictating our governments.\"\nMr. Kyburz concludes his commentary with the following statement:\n* Warning *\nIf the good Jews do not denounce the bad Jews (Ashkenazis),\nthey share the guilt!\n[29] Commenting on televised comments made by a former CSIS agent with respect to groups such as Patriots on Guard, Mr. Kyburz' November 9, 2000 DIP says:\nFirst I will tell you that you are very, very insensitive to call the murderers, child molesters, terrorists and pedophiles Jews. They are not Jews, yet they call themselves Jews. They are the Ashkenazis. Are they the seed of Satan? I don't know. I know that it would be impossible for the spawn of Satan to commit worse crimes than these characters commit...\"\n[30] The notion of Ashkenazi Jews as frauds is reinforced in Mr. Kyburz' November 17, 2000 DIP, which contains an extract of a book entitled Truth and Justice versus Lies and Hatred. This book extract questions the extent of the Holocaust, suggesting that somewhere in the vicinity of 2-300,000 Jews actually perished during the Second World War, rather than the oft-cited figure of six million deaths. To some extent, the writer suggests, the Jews were the authors of their own misfortune:\nThe anti-Jewish - falsely dubbed as anti-Semitic stipulations of the National Socialist programs were, in fact, a slap in the face for Jews who were loyal to the German state. The Zionist Movement which operates throughout the world, took these measures as a crucial back-up in their efforts to attain their own goals. That is why Zionist [sic] stoked the fires of confrontation between the Reich Government and the Jews internationally. That is something that we are not supposed to know today. The Zionists were convinced that only if their co-religionists were segregated in their host countries would they be interested in settling Palestine. They even welcomed the Nuremberg Laws because they put wind into the sails of Zionist aspirations.\nMr. Kyburz states that he is publishing this excerpt ... to unveil part of the truth regarding the 'Holocaust'.\n[31] In his November 18, 2000 DIP, Mr. Kyburz follows an article critical of Israeli actions against the Palestinians during the most recent Intifada with the statement that:\nThe Ashkenazis are in their element. Destruction of property and life is their great ability. That's what they do best. They practize [sic] that ability where ever and whenever they find an opportunity. They have done it throughout the centuries.\n[32] Mr. Kyburz' comments in his December 18, 2000 DIP mark the beginning of a shift in the focus of his attentions. Zionist Jews are now equated with Ashkenazi Jews. According to Mr. Kyburz, the Zionist Jews' agenda should also provoke consternation in the reader:\nNow folks, the Khazars(8) (Zionist Jews) which [sic] are in control and create the wars for Israel are also in control of the NWO [New World Order(9)] Can you imagine the fate which will await you once these people are in total control? Remember, Stalin was one of them. He killed tens of millions of his own people. Some estimates go as high as a hundred million. These depraved characters have not become more civilized in the meantime. Either they are being stopped or we will have to experience the wrath of their depraved and twisted minds. I, for one, am not too excited to become one of their victims. How about you?\nThe March 25, 2001 DIP refers back to the October 25, 2000 DIP, noting that it:\n... shows the real character of the Zionist Jews. Their speciality is child abductions, child pornography, child molestation, slavery and murder. Yes, that's the type in our courts, in the Universities, in governments, in the police, in the medical profession specializing in abortion, everywhere they could have a chance to destroy life.\n[33] Subsequent DIPs describe Zionist and\/or Ashkenazi Jews as the most ruthless terrorists in the world, who do not respect the rights, freedoms or lives of others(10), a criminal and murderous group of thugs, who are sub-human and demented (11), people who will kill a great proportion of the world's population unless they are stopped.(12)\n[34] Mr. Kyburz' comments are not always limited to Zionist or Ashkenazi Jews but are, on occasion, directed at Jews as a whole. For example, his December 21, 2000 DIP states that The Jews have inflicted an incredible amount of harm throughout the world over centuries. He goes on to refer specifically to Zionist Jews, stating that they will never change their ways because:\n...being frauds, criminals, war mongers, pedophiles, anti-life and full of hate is part of them ... It is their nature. They will not and cannot change. If we do not want them to destroy our civilization, our way of life, our rights and freedoms we should make sure that they have no part in the decision making. This means that they will not be allowed in any government institution of any kind.\n[35] Richard Warman testified that in March of 2001, he became aware of the Patriots on Guard web site, through his involvement in human rights work. He contacted Mr. Kyburz' Internet service provider, alerting it to the nature of the content on the site. As a result, service to the site was cut off, and the site was shut down. According to Mr. Warman, the Patriots on Guard web site was not accessible for several days in April of 2001, although it was back up within a couple of days, through a different service provider.\n[36] Mr. Warman's efforts to shut down the web site did not go unnoticed by Mr. Kyburz. On April 7, 2001, an e-mail was sent to Mr. Warman from someone identifying himself as Fred Kyburz, using the kyburz@telusplanet.net e-mail address. The circumstances surrounding the sending of the e-mail, together with its content establish, on a balance of probabilities, that it was sent by Mr. Kyburz. The correspondence, which was copied to dozens of other recipients, can best be described as a diatribe against Mr. Warman for having caused the Patriots on Guard web site to shut down.\n[37] In reviewing Mr. Kyburz' message to Mr. Warman, it is apparent that Mr. Kyburz assumed that Mr. Warman was himself Jewish. Indeed, much of his venom is directed at Mr. Warman and his Zionist Jewish brethren :\nYou got the nerve to call me an 'antisemite' [sic]! I am NOT an anti-Semite - unlike yourself! I am anti-vermin, anti-crime, anti-child abuse, anti-child pornography, anti-Zionist propaganda.\nYou are an anti-Semite since your ilk have the blood of thousands of Jews on your hands as well as the blood of millions of white people. You are anti-Semite, anti-white and anti-right.... I have warned you idiots of my intent to expose your communistic Zionist agenda. Now you have given me good reason to make good on my promise. You will see much of your ilk's atrocities exposed. It will show who the TRUE anti-Semites are.\nYou call my exposure of your ilk's devious and criminal actions 'hatred of an identifiable group (ie. in this case Jewish people).' It's not hatred on my part, it is unspeakable hatred by your Zionist brethren's insidious and murderous actions against innocent people (ie. in this case white children). I will write about the possible motives of your Zionist Jewish brethren in the near future. You can holler and scream ANTI-SEMITE as loud as you want, the louder the better. The louder you shout the more I will expose your incredibly devious intentions. So go ahead. I am ready for battle.\n[38] Mr. Kyburz then began to include regular references to Mr. Warman in his DIPs. For example, in the August 5, 2001 DIP, Mr. Kyburz stated:\nRemember that these Jews are the Zionist Jews, mostly Ashkenazi Jews - all of them hard core communists. They are also the ones in control of the media everywhere. They are as well in control of Hollywood. Is it any surprise that the news of the media is twisted? Is it any surprise that nothing but scum and stench comes out of Hollywood?\nRichard Warman ... [here Mr. Kyburz names other individuals who have incurred his wrath] ... am I an anti-Semite by bringing the cold truth to light about these criminal and murderous minds you so fervently support and protect?\n[39] The December 15, 2001 DIP refers to Mr. Warman's effort to shut down Mr. Kyburz' web site, specifically mentioning Mr. Warman by name. The DIP goes on to say:\nWe have to stop these low lives for what they are and their incredible atrocities. We can only stop their murderous actions by full exposure. It is hard, if not impossible, for a normal individual to understand how anyone could be as evil as they are. The fact is, that we better learn before they are poisoning us with their proposed vaccinations and other medical poisons.\n[40] In his December 18, 2001 DIP, Mr. Kyburz refers to Mr. Warman as a wretched character, saying that he is a willing flunkey of the Zionist\/communist Israeli government. Mr. Kyburz subsequently refers people like Mr. Warman as sub-human criminal minds who ... do not shy away from any crime in order to reach their goal of complete world domination.\n[41] The final reference to Richard Warman in the Patriots on Guard web site is contained in the December 20, 2001 DIP. Following his observation that The Jews (Zionists) are as evil as they have always been. War is their game. Profits from war is [sic] their aim., Mr. Kyburz goes on to say:\nRichard Warman, if you can prove me wrong speak up. Write me an e-mail and make your objections known. Don't be a jerk or a coward. Sign your name to your e-mail. And don't try to shut down my web site again because you object to my straight forward talk. If you object to my telling the truth then change your ways and get your fellow Zionist frauds to change. I know to change your characters is a virtual impossibility. To be underhanded, dishonest and a fraud is your nature and your fellow Zionist brethren's nature.\n[42] It was shortly after this message was posted on the Web that the Patriots on Guard web site was shut down for good. It is unclear from the evidence whether this was as a result of Mr. Warman's efforts.\n(ii) Are These Messages Likely to Expose a Person or Persons to Hatred or Contempt by Reason of the Fact That They are Identifiable on the Basis of a Prohibited Ground of Discrimination? [43] In considering this question, the Tribunal was aided by the testimony of Dr. Karen Mock, a Psychologist who was qualified as an expert in discrimination, anti-Semitism, racism and hate material. In this case, there was nothing subtle or nuanced about the material contained on the web site, which was clearly hateful on its face. Dr. Mock's testimony was, however, of assistance in identifying some of the traditional anti-Semitic themes referenced in the material, such as the concept of 'blood libel', the Jews' alleged goal of world domination, and their ostensible control of various institutions.(13)\n[44] The terms hatred and contempt have been judicially considered in previous section 13 cases. In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor (14), the Supreme Court of Canada cited with approval the definitions of hatred and contempt utilized by the Tribunal in Nealy v. Johnston (15). In Nealy, the Tribunal said:\nWith hatred the focus is a set of emotions and feelings which involve extreme ill will towards another person or group of persons. To say that one hates another means in effect that one finds no redeeming qualities in the latter. It is a term, however, which does not necessarily involve the mental process of looking down on another or others. It is quite possible to hate someone who one feels is superior to one in intelligence, wealth, or power. None of the synonyms used in the dictionary definition for hatred give any clues to the motivation for the ill will. Contempt is by contrast a term which suggests a mental process of looking down upon or treating as inferior the object of one's feelings.\n[45] The Tribunal in Nealy also considered the meaning of the word expose as it is used in section 13. Citing the original Tribunal decision in Taylor, the Nealy Tribunal said:\n\"Expose is an unusual word to find in legislation to control hate propaganda. More frequently, as in the Broadcasting Act Regulations, Post Office Act provisions and in the various related sections of the Criminal Code, the reference is to matter which is abusive or offensive, or to statements which serve to incite or promote hatred.\n\"Incite means to stir up; promote means to support actively. Expose is a more passive word, which seems to indicate that an active effort or intent on the part of the communicator or a violent reaction on the part of the recipient are not envisaged. To expose to hatred also indicates a more subtle and indirect type of communication than vulgar abuse or overtly offensive language. Expose means: to leave a person unprotected; to leave without shelter or defense; to lay open (to danger, ridicule, censure etc.). In other words, if one is creating the right conditions for hatred to flourish, leaving the identifiable group open or vulnerable to ill-feelings or hostility, if one is putting them at risk of being hated, in a situation where hatred or contempt are inevitable, one falls within the compass of section 13(1) of the Human Rights Act.\n[46] In the Tribunal's view, there can be no doubt that the messages contained on the Patriots on Guard web site are likely to expose people of the Jewish faith to both hatred and contempt. Having singled out Ashkenazi Jews for particular criticism, Mr. Kyburz has discriminated against Jews of European ancestry on the basis of both their religion as well as their national or ethnic origin.\n[47] Mr. Kyburz does not, however, limit his comments to Jews of European ancestry. In finding that the messages expose Jews generally to hatred and contempt, and not just Ashkenazi Jews, the Tribunal notes that while much of Mr. Kyburz' attention is focused specifically on Ashkenazi Jews(16), some of his commentary addresses the supposed evil nature and mis-deeds of Jews as a whole. Mr. Kyburz further suggests that non-Ashkenazi Jews are complicit in the alleged evil activities of the Ashkenazi Jews. A number of the articles published by Mr. Kyburz on his web site draw no distinction between Ashkenazi Jews and Jews of non-European origin.\n[48] When read in context, the messages on the Patriots on Guard web site tell the reader that Jewish people are innately devious, treacherous, and murderous. Not only do they want to kidnap, corrupt, and kill white children, their ultimate goal is to take over the world. Such messages can only serve to foster hatred against the Jewish people. Of even greater concern are the messages, notably the Pierce article, that openly advocate the extermination of the Jewish people.\n[49] Further, Mr. Kyburz' use of terms such as sub-human, scum, vermin and low-lives to describe Jews could most certainly lead some readers to view Jews as inferior beings, causing them to hold Jewish people in contempt. As Dr. Mock testified, this tactic of the dehumanization of the Jewish people was common in Nazi propaganda. By making Jews appear as something less than human, Dr. Mock explained, it became easier to kill them.\n[50] The persuasive effect of these messages is enhanced by Mr. Kyburz' use of what Dr. Mock described as a pseudo-academic approach, exemplified by his references to the noted historian David Irving and the truth-seeking Ernst Zundel. A further example of this technique are the references to articles published by groups such as the Institute for Historical Review, an organization committed to debunking the 'myth' of the Holocaust.\n[51] As regards Mr. Warman's allegation that Mr. Kyburz's messages discriminate against Jews on the basis of race, we note that Dr. Mock testified that Jews are not members of a race, but rather share a common religion. We accept Dr. Mock's testimony that Mr. Kyburz has, nevertheless, attempted to 'racialize' Jews, with his suggestion that their various alleged character flaws are inherited or innate. This is evidenced by his frequent comments about people of their ilk, as well as by references to such things as the real character of the Zionist Jews. This tactic is perhaps epitomized by the last DIP, with its comment that Zionist Jews will never change, because ...being frauds, criminals, war mongers, pedophiles, anti-life and full of hate is part of them ... It is their nature. They will not and cannot change.\n[52] The fact that Jews do not constitute a race does not operate to defeat this aspect of Mr. Warman's complaint. Human rights jurisprudence has interpreted prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of a proscribed ground of discrimination to include the prohibition of discrimination based on perceived membership in the protected group.(17) The Tribunal therefore finds that the messages contained on the Patriots on Guard web site are likely to expose people of the Jewish faith to hatred and contempt on the basis of their perceived race, as well as their religion and, in the case of Ashkenazi Jews, their national or ethnic origin.\nD. Finding Regarding the Section 13 Complaint [53] As was noted in one of the articles posted on the Patriots on Guard web site, international law recognizes the right of individuals to freedom of opinion and expression. For example, Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights(18) provides that such right ... includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media ....\n[54] While the right to hold and express one's opinions is a cornerstone of a free and democratic society, such a right is not unlimited. In some situations, the protection of society mandates limits on what individuals may say. For this reason, it is unlawful to shout Fire! in a crowded theatre when no fire exists, to phone in a bomb threat, or to threaten to kill another person.\n[55] In the Taylor case, the Supreme Court of Canada had occasion to scrutinize the reach of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in light of international law principles, as well as the Charter guarantee of freedom of opinion and expression.(19) The Court concluded that while section 13 infringed the right to freedom of opinion and expression, this infringement was justified in light of international commitments to eradicate hate propaganda, and Canada's commitment to the values of equality and multiculturalism.\n[56] Having found that Fred Kyburz did communicate, repeatedly, by means of the facilities of a telecommunications undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, matter that is likely to expose people of the Jewish faith to hatred or contempt, Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint is substantiated.\nV. THE SECTION 14.1 RETALIATION COMPLAINT A. The Allegedly Retaliatory Messages [57] After the Patriots on Guard web site was shut down, a Patriots on Guard Internet web forum was established. Mr. Warman explained that a web forum is a domain where people can post messages and view the messages posted by others. The Patriots on Guard web forum was an open forum, which means that anyone could sign up to participate in the forum's discussions. A member could also choose to have any new posting on the site automatically e-mailed to him or her as soon as the material was posted. Mr. Warman signed up to join the web forum, using a false name, and, as a result, was able to access the information posted there.\n[58] The content of the material posted on the Patriots on Guard web forum is similar in nature to that which appeared on the Patriots on Guard web site, and includes messages signed by Fred Kyburz, sent through the freburz@yahoo.ca e-mail address. The timing of the establishment of the web forum, together with the name of the forum and the subject matter of the debate in the material posted, establishes that the web forum was created by Mr. Kyburz. This finding is confirmed by the exchange of e-mails appearing at Tab 28 of Exhibit HR-1, where Mr. Kyburz refers to my web site http:\/\/www.patriotsonguard.org.\n[59] Further, we find that numerous postings appearing in the web forum originate from Mr. Kyburz. In coming to this conclusion, we note that these messages are signed by Mr. Kyburz, either as 'Fred' or 'Fred Kyburz'. In many cases, the context as well as the content of the messages make it clear that they came from Mr. Kyburz.\n[60] On February 5, 2002, Richard Warman filed his original complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. On April 26, 2002, Mr. Kyburz posted an exchange of e-mails between himself and a producer of the CTV television show W-5 regarding a television program on the 'de-tax' movement. (20) In the initial e-mails, the producer asks Mr. Kyburz if he would like to participate in the show. Mr. Kyburz declines. After the show was broadcast, Mr. Kyburz sent the producer a lengthy e-mail expressing his disgust with the broadcast. In the course of his comments, Mr. Kyburz stated:\nNow you can go and complain to the Canadian Human Rights Commission about my anti-semitism [sic] just as did your fellow Zionist Richard Warman, a valued employee of the Federal Court of Canada and the Department of Justice - a great crowd! The CHRC is an organization that has to deny truth as a defense. That's how low these people have sunk. They have to deny truth in order to protect their criminal behaviour. They are so incredibly demented that they believe their own twisted reasoning. Richard Warman must be your treasured ally ...\n[61] Mr. Kyburz goes on to reproduce a copy of a letter that he says he sent to the Honourable John Richard, the Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Canada, where Mr. Warman was formerly employed. After referring to Mr. Warman's efforts to shut down his web site, and to Mr. Warman's complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Mr. Kyburz says:\nI do discuss a wide range of topics on my web site. Some of the topics include slavery, murder, terrorist activities, pedophilia, war, taxes, inalienable rights of individuals, child prostitution, child pornography, etc. I have posted other people's opinions, newspaper articles, as well as my own conclusions.\nSome of the articles discuss actions of Jews implicated in child pornography, child prostitution, slavery, murder, genocide, etc. These are well-publicized stories. Warman, a Jew, is not happy to have his fellow Jews and their fiendish activities exposed, obviously his motive for his complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. This means that he is in full support of such nefarious acts as child prostitution, child pornography, murder, genocide, slavery and wholesale slaughter of innocent people. No individual with a smidgen of a conscience will engage in, or be in support of, such fiendish and sub-human activities as mentioned above. Mr. Warman obviously has no conscience....\nNow Sir, I am asking you herewith to:\n1) Dismiss Mr. Richard Warman immediately from his present government position without severance pay. He is not allowed anytime in the future to hold another government position or an advisory position to any government body or government employee. If he is not dismissed by April 12, 2002, without severance pay, I will make public that you fully support the above mentioned crimes being committed by employees of the Department of Justice. I will also make sure that Canadians are made aware that every judge [i]n Canada is in support of the abovementioned crimes (unless a judge demonstrates clearly with his rulings that he does not support any of the above crimes, meaning that his rulings are based on 'the Law of the Land'.)\n2) get Mr. Richard Warman to write me an apology\n3) get Mr. Richard Warman to ask my previous server (Rackspace), to reinstate my web site on David Icke's web site(21)\n4) get the investigation by the Canadian Human Rights Commission against myself and my web site terminated immediately.\n[62] The letter to the Chief Justice indicates that it was being copied to every Member of Parliament and Senator. Mr. Kyburz also asks readers to write to the Chief Justice ... and give him a piece of your mind. There is nothing in the material before the Tribunal to indicate that Chief Justice Richard ever responded to Mr. Kyburz' letter, nor is there any indication that Mr. Warman suffered any adverse employment consequences as a result of Mr. Kyburz' letter to the Chief Justice.\n[63] In a subsequent posting, Mr. Kyburz reproduces some of the correspondence exchanged during the course of the Commission investigation into Mr. Warman's complaint. Commenting on one of Mr. Warman's letters, Mr. Kyburz says:\nMr. Warman, since you are so diligently following my every written word I do not see the need to send you a copy of this post. I am sure that you will not miss it. I will make sure though that every MP and Senator will receive this post as well as the Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Canada and every Commissioner. Additionally many other people will receive it. I would think that you have the deep desire to become famous. This will come to pass. Many people will become familiar with the name 'Richard Warman' and all it stands for. Aren't you tickled pink?! ...\nFreedom of speech is non-existent or forbidden when Jewish and Zionist atrocities are involved. Yet, when you talk about NAZI atrocities nobody is allowed to even ask a question. Hypocrisy seems to be a way of life for you and your fellow Zionist brethren. Mr. Warman, to any level headed individual you look like a real jerk. What is good for you is forbidden to everyone else. What you and your fellow Zionists do all day is off limits for everyone else. It seems to me that discrimination is your way of life...\nYou poor fellow. You cry like a baby who misses his mother. Do you think that I should simply take your abuse, your terrorist tactics against myself, your frauds, your lies, your coercion, your threats, your underhandedness, your intimidation, your vile behaviour against me? Don't think that I am your run-of-the-mill victim! You started this fight, you better don't [sic] chicken out now. Show what you are made of. I hate to deal with cowards. You will realize very quickly now that the shit that you stirred up will not settle down quickly. You will find yourself enmeshed in a lawsuit fairly soon - too soon for your liking. You might even face two or more lawsuits. They will be easy to deal with compared to the flyers you will have to face if you don't re-instate my web site with Rackspace with David Icke's web site before the flyers are being distributed (22)...\nIf the Commissioners continue with their investigation against me they will face the same exposure I will give you. You have an interesting time ahead of you. Brace yourself and know that I am not the only one utterly disgusted with your criminal behaviour. [Emphasis in the original text]\n[64] Mr. Kyburz' threats against Mr. Warman become even more explicit in the next posting, where he states:\nI just found out today that Mr. Richard Warman will have to face charges of libel and extortion by the end of August. I might take this same approach if this investigation against myself and my web site is not dropped immediately and Mr. Warman has not re-instated my web site with Rackspace and David Icke's web site. Mr. Warman will not be the only defendant should I choose to take this same approach. Every Commissioner as well as you [here Mr. Kyburz names two Commission employees] will be named in the suit. That will be your least worry though. The flyers will be much worse to contend with than the lawsuit. Once the flyers have started they will not stop. The flyers have the capacity to ruin your professional career as well as your life. This is not a threat, it is a warning and fair notice to you all. Careers of judges and police officers have been severely impeded if not destroyed as well as their family lives. Folks, crime does not pay, remember that. Devious accusations by the guilty parties against the people who try to spread the truth will not be successful any longer either.\nI have given you repeated warnings. I do not wish to destroy anyone's life or career. But people who do not respect the law of the land will have to pay the price for their reckless violations of individual's common law rights and freedoms. Let me tell you: Crime does not pay and a career built on crime will have to be stopped.\nMr. Kyburz signs this posting Ernst-Friedrich Kyburz. This posting indicates that it is being copied to Members of Parliament and Senators, Members of the Alberta Legislature, Chief Justice Richard, the Commissioners of the Canadian Human Rights Commission and many others.\n[65] In a posting dated June 11, 2002, Mr. Kyburz reproduces an article from the National Post dealing with measures being taken by Transport Canada to deal with the threat of terrorism. After commenting on what he says are the criminal actions of government, Mr. Kyburz says I wonder if this idea was concocted by Richard Warman or one of his ilk? These are the people who have the most evil ideas of restricting freedom everywhere. They are the specialists in terrorism, murder and genocide.... After having identified Mr. Warman as a terrorist, Mr. Kyburz goes on to state We have to use every possible method to rid Canada of terrorists.\n[66] Mr. Kyburz's subsequent web postings contain repeated references to Richard Warman. Some of these are disparaging comments, often related to his perceived Jewish faith. Some are more in the nature of implied threats, such as the comment that Richard Warman has spoiled his future. In some postings, the threat is more direct: the July 22 posting includes a lawyer joke, sent to Mr. Warman to brighten his day. Mr. Kyburz explains sending the joke, saying I know you are feeling down knowing that criminal charges coming your way and flyers in the making about your fine character. On August 1, 2002, Mr. Kyburz says Richard Warman, we have figured you and your devilish racket out. Bra[c]e yourself, the law of action and reaction is in effect.\n[67] Six days later, Mr. Kyburz posted a news story regarding the death of a police officer named Eric Taylor. Officer Taylor was allegedly shot to death by a man named Don Matthews. The article indicates that Mr. Matthews was the president of the National Constitutional Academy, a group that believes police have no law enforcement power. After asserting that he ... detest[s] violence from any side, Mr. Kyburz says:\nWhat will people do when they are pushed into the corner without an escape? What will they do when they can observe day in and day out the relentless assault on our rights and freedoms - when they experience the reckless and devious lying and twisting of the law of the land for purposes of everyone's enslavement by any and every government agency, including the courts and the police?\nDo the people in these government agencies think that they will escape their devious actions scot free? Do they think that everyone will wait to be slaughtered without any resistance? I am afraid that a number of people will act as Don Matthews did - line one of the NWO flunkies up in the cross hairs and pull the trigger.\nAnd yes, Mr. Richard Warman, you have been noted by a number of people, as you are well aware. People do not take kindly any longer to your abusive, menacing, libelous and lawless behaviour. This is not a threat, it is a warning for your consideration before you get yourself in deeper trouble than you are in already. Your Zionist tactics are noted by the enemies you created for yourself. You will not be able to handle them - not even with the help of your Zionist brethren. They will drown themselves in the pig shit they tried to get the entire world into.\nB. The Undisclosed Messages [68] Included in the material filed with the Tribunal are a group of messages posted on the Patriots on Guard web forum shortly before the hearing was to begin. Counsel for the Commission asked to file this material, notwithstanding that the documents had not been disclosed to Mr. Kyburz in advance of the hearing, as required by the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure. The Tribunal allowed the material to be filed at the hearing, reserving our decision as to what, if any, weight would be attributed to the documents, given that they were not disclosed to Mr. Kyburz before the hearing.\n[69] The non-disclosure of the documents presents the Tribunal with an interesting dilemma. The disclosure obligations imposed on parties under the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure are designed to ensure that each party is aware of the case that they have to meet in advance of the hearing. In the case of respondents, pre-hearing disclosure also ensures that the respondent is aware of the full extent of the allegations against him, thus enabling the respondent to gauge the extent of his potential exposure.\n[70] In this case, while Mr. Kyburz would arguably not have been aware of the Commission's intention to rely on the most recent postings, Mr. Warman's complaint did allege that the discriminatory practice was ongoing. Further, had Mr. Kyburz appeared at the hearing, the Tribunal would likely have allowed the Commission to adduce the additional evidence, as it would have been difficult for Mr. Kyburz to demonstrate that he was surprised by the documents, or prejudiced in any way, in that the documents appear to have originated from Mr. Kyburz himself. This raises the question of whether a respondent should be able to put himself in a more advantageous position by refusing to participate in a Tribunal hearing than he would have been in, had he shown up.\n[71] At the end of the day, however, we do not need to resolve this issue. The additional documents add little to the complaint, in that they simply consist of further examples of the type of messages already described.\nC. Analysis of the Retaliation Complaint [72] There can be no doubt that Mr. Kyburz both retaliated and threatened to retaliate against Mr. Warman for having filed his section 13 human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[73] The most obvious example of actual retaliation is the letter Mr. Kyburz apparently sent to Chief Justice Richard, in an effort to get Mr. Warman fired from his employment with the Federal Court of Canada. It does not matter that this effort does not appear to have been successful - a section 14.1 violation is made out when a respondent tries to inflict harm on a complainant for having filed his complaint.(23) By copying the letter to numerous other individuals, Mr. Kyburz clearly intended to maximize the damage to Mr. Warman's reputation.\n[74] Of even greater concern are the threats to Mr. Warman's life. A reasonable reading of Mr. Kyburz' expression of ostensible concern that someone might line one of the NWO flunkies up in the cross hairs and pull the trigger comment, immediately followed by the reference to Mr. Warman's activities having been noted, is that this was intended as a veiled warning that Mr. Warman's life was in danger. Similarly, the statement in the June 11, 2002 forum posting linking Mr. Warman to terrorism, followed by the exhortation to ... use every possible method to rid Canada of terrorists can reasonably be interpreted as a threat to Mr. Warman's life.\n[75] There are also clear and repeated threats to subject Mr. Warman to a flyer campaign, with the avowed intent of ruining his career and his life, as well as numerous verbal attacks on Mr. Warman, his character, and his motivations in filing the complaint.\n[76] While Mr. Kyburz had included references to Mr. Warman in his web postings even before Mr. Warman filed his human rights complaint, as a result of Mr. Warman's efforts to shut down the Patriots on Guard web site, both the content and the frequency of the comments changed after the complaint was filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Not only are the references to Mr. Warman more frequent - they also became more vitriolic. Many messages make direct reference to Mr. Warman's complaint or to the Commission investigation process. As noted, other messages include threats to harm Mr. Warman in various ways. It is clear that the filing of Mr. Warman's complaint was a significant factor in the escalation of Mr. Kyburz' campaign against Mr. Warman. This clearly establishes a breach of section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and accordingly this aspect of Mr. Warman's complaint is also sustained.\n[77] Before leaving the issue of retaliation, it should be noted that Mr. Warman also testified to his belief that Mr. Kyburz was involved in the laying of criminal charges against him. While this could most certainly constitute retaliatory activity, the documentary evidence before us raises a real question as to whether Mr. Kyburz was behind the laying of the charges.(24) While Mr. Kyburz was most certainly kept advised as to what was happening in relation to the criminal charges, it appears that the charges themselves were actually laid by two other individuals, who had their own objections to Mr. Warman's activities. Having regard to all of the evidence before us in relation to this issue, we are not persuaded that the laying of the criminal charges against Mr. Warman constitutes retaliation by Mr. Kyburz for Mr. Warman having filed his section 13 complaint. Mr. Kyburz does, however, threaten to file criminal charges of his own against Mr. Warman, which, in this context, is a further example of retaliatory conduct.\nVI. THE COPYRIGHT NOTICE [78] As was noted earlier, Mr. Kyburz sent the Tribunal a document entitled Copyright Notice, relating to the name Ernst-Friedrich Kyburz. Mr. Kyburz did not, however, provide the Tribunal with any explanation of what he hoped to achieve by this action. Suffice it to say that one cannot insulate oneself from liability for breach of a statute such as the Canadian Human Rights Act by the delivery of a copyright notice.\nVII. REMEDY [79] Having substantiated both Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint and his section 14.1 complaint, the final issue to be determined is that of remedy. Sections 13 and 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act each engage different remedial provisions of the Act, and thus the appropriate remedy for each complaint will be dealt with separately.\nA. The Section 13 Complaint (i) Cease and Desist Order [80] Where a section 13 complaint is substantiated, section 54(1)(a) of the Act empowers the Tribunal to order the respondent to cease the discriminatory practice, and to take measures in consultation with the Commission to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in the future.\n[81] Internet communications present a particular challenge for the Tribunal in crafting a meaningful remedy. The unique nature of Internet technology, including the jurisdictional challenges arising from the borderless world of cyberspace, as well as the 'moving targets' created by the use of mirror sites, raise real concerns as to the efficacy of cease and desist orders in relation to hate messages disseminated on the Internet.\n[82] Despite these limitations, as was noted by the Tribunal in Z\u00fcndel, a cease and desist order can have both practical and symbolic consequences. On a practical level, such an order should prevent the respondent himself from continuing to communicate material of the nature described in this decision. Further, there is an important symbolic value to the public denunciation of the actions which form the subject matter of Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint. We adopt the observation of the Tribunal in Z\u00fcndel, that Parliament, on behalf of all Canadians, has determined that the telephonic communication of hate messages is not to be tolerated in our society.... [T]he victims of hate are entitled to obtain the benefit of the full weight of [the Tribunal's] authority.\n[83] Accordingly, the Tribunal orders that Fred Kyburz, and any other individuals who act in concert with Mr. Kyburz, cease the discriminatory practice of communicating telephonically or causing to be communicated telephonically by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, matters of the type contained in Exhibits HR-1 and HR-2, or any other messages of a substantially similar content, that are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, contrary to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. For sake of clarity, this order includes the requirement that Mr. Kyburz cease publicizing the Patriots on Guard web site material now posted on the Archive.org web site, or referring anyone to the Archive.org site.\n[84] Although Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint was filed in relation to the Patriots on Guard web site, it is apparent that since the filing of the complaint, Mr. Kyburz has used the Patriots on Guard web forum as a vehicle for the transmission of his hateful messages. Accordingly, the Tribunal's order extends to cover material posted on the Patriots on Guard forum. Recognizing that some time may be required to dismantle the existing web forum, the Tribunal orders that Mr. Kyburz shut down the Patriots on Guard web forum within seven days of being notified of this decision. This should not be interpreted as giving Mr. Kyburz licence to say what he wants to in the interim period. To this end, the Tribunal orders that Mr. Kyburz cease and desist from posting any new Internet communications of the type that form the subject matter of the section 13 complaint, whether on the Patriots on Guard web forum or elsewhere on the Internet, immediately upon being notified of the Tribunal's decision.\n[85] The Commission asked that the Tribunal order that service of the Tribunal's decision on Mr. Kyburz could be effected by priority courier and e-mail. Having regard to the very serious potential consequences for Mr. Kyburz if he does not comply with the Tribunal's ruling, the Tribunal is of the view that such an order is not appropriate. Further, in that it is the Federal Court, and not the Tribunal that is responsible for the enforcement of the Tribunal's orders, we are of the view that it would not be appropriate for this Tribunal to purport to dictate to the Federal Court what should constitute sufficient notice to Mr. Kyburz, should enforcement proceedings become necessary.\n[86] The Commission also asked that the Tribunal order Mr. Kyburz to contact Archive.org in order to have the Patriots on Guard web site material removed from the Archive.org site. We have concerns about the enforceability of such an order. Such a request would in all likelihood require an explanation from Mr. Kyburz as to why he was asking that the material be removed. This could potentially compel Mr. Kyburz to say something that he does not believe to be true, a result that the Federal Court found to be problematic in Stevenson v. Canadian Security and Intelligence Service. (25) Further, in the event that Mr. Kyburz' efforts are unsuccessful, questions could subsequently arise as to the sincerity of his request, requiring the type of subjective assessment that could make enforcement difficult. It seems to us that a request from the Commission to Archive.org, accompanied by a copy of this decision, is much more likely to be effective, and thus we decline to make the order requested. In the absence of statutory authorization, the Tribunal cannot make an order against a non-party to this proceeding. However, we would encourage the proprietors of the Archive.org web site to give serious consideration to removing the offending material from the site.\n(ii) Special Compensation [87] Where a victim is specifically identified in the communications that constitute the discriminatory practice under section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, subsection 54(1)(b) of the Act authorizes the Tribunal to order a respondent to pay special compensation of up to $20,000. Subsection 54(1)(b) incorporates by reference subsection 53(3) of the Act, which provides that such compensation may be ordered if the Tribunal finds that ... the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[88] In assessing the appropriateness of such an order in this case, it should be kept in mind that the discriminatory practice in issue here is the communication of hate messages contrary to section 13 of the Act. As a consequence, the only messages in issue at this point are those which form the subject of Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint - that is, the messages that appeared on the Patriots on Guard web site. While the e-mail message to Mr. Warman from Mr. Kyburz and the messages appearing on the Patriots on Guard web forum are relevant to the remedy to be awarded with respect to the section 14.1 violation, we have not considered those messages in connection with the section 13 remedy.\n[89] Mr. Kyburz began including regular references to Mr. Warman, who he identified by name, in his postings on the Patriots on Guard web site as a result of Mr. Warman's efforts to shut down the site. The references to Mr. Warman are noteworthy for their degree of vitriol, motivated, at least in part, by Mr. Kyburz' perception that Mr. Warman was himself Jewish. This reflects a recurring pattern in Mr. Kyburz' web postings: as soon as anyone disagrees with his views, that person immediately becomes part of the world-wide Jewish conspiracy.\n[90] Mr. Warman testified that he was not Jewish. In our view, the fact that Mr. Warman was not himself Jewish does not detract in any way from the viciousness of the attacks launched against him by Mr. Kyburz. These attacks were clearly motivated, at least in part, by Mr. Kyburz' perception that Mr. Warman was Jewish. Based upon this belief, Mr. Kyburz ascribed very negative character traits, as well as criminal behaviour to Mr. Warman. Mr. Warman, quite understandably, found this conduct to be very hurtful. In our view, Mr. Warman is a victim of the discriminatory practice.\n[91] Mr. Kyburz' behaviour was both willful and repeated. In our view, Mr. Warman is entitled to a significant award under this head. Accordingly, the Tribunal awards Mr. Warman the sum of $15,000 as special compensation, pursuant to subsection 54(1)(b) of the Act.\n(iii) Interest [92] Interest is payable on non-pecuniary awards made under the Canadian Human Rights Act .(26) Interest shall be paid on the monies awarded pursuant to this decision by way of special compensation, in accordance with Rule 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure. Interest will start to run from the date of this decision to the date of payment. In no case, however, should the total amount payable on account of special compensation, including interest, exceed $20,000. (27)\n(iv) Penalty [93] Subsection 54(1)(c) of the Act permits the Tribunal to order a respondent in a section 13 complaint to pay a penalty of up to $10,000. The inclusion of this provision in the 1998 amendments to the Act represents a significant departure from the traditional approach that damage awards in human rights cases were primarily remedial, and not punitive. To date, no order has been made by the Tribunal under this provision.\n[94] Awards of special compensation made under subsection 54(1)(b) in relation to section 13 complaints are intended to compensate individuals specifically named in hate messages. In contrast, penalties levied pursuant to subsection 54(1)(c) of the Act are intended to reflect society's opprobrium for the respondent's conduct.(28)\n[95] In deciding whether to order Mr. Kyburz to pay a penalty in this case, Parliament has directed that we take several factors into account. These include ... the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice, as well as the wilfulness or intent of the person who engaged in the discriminatory practice, any prior discriminatory practices that the person has engaged in and the person's ability to pay the penalty.\"(29) Each of these factors will be considered in turn.\n[96] Insofar as the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice are concerned, we have found that Mr. Kyburz repeatedly communicated messages regarding Jewish people that were nasty, vicious and extreme. Not only did these messages attribute numerous and varied criminal acts to people of the Jewish faith, described therein as innately corrupt and devious, but some messages went so far as to openly advocate the extermination of Jews root and branch as a class. This weighs heavily in favour of the assessment of a significant penalty.\n[97] We have found that Mr. Kyburz was responsible for the communications on the Patriots on Guard web site. It is clear from the messages themselves that he communicated this information wilfully, knowing that it was upsetting to many people. There is, however, no evidence before the Tribunal to suggest that Mr. Kyburz has been involved in any prior discriminatory practices, which serves as a mitigating factor.\n[98] The final consideration for the Tribunal is Mr. Kyburz' ability to pay a penalty. In this regard, we note that the only information that we have in relation to this issue is the unsworn assertion contained in one of Mr. Kyburz' web postings that he is impecunious.(30) In closing argument, counsel for the Commission suggested that the burden in this regard lay not on the Commission to show that Mr. Kyburz had resources, but rather on Mr. Kyburz to show that he was unable to pay, as this type of information would be largely within Mr. Kyburz' control.\n[99] There is at least some jurisprudence to support the Commission's position. In R. v. Noseworthy(31), the Newfoundland Court of Appeal considered the issue of the burden of proof with respect to an individual's ability to pay, noting that:\nIn the ordinary course of any litigation, it is the duty of the party pleading or otherwise relying on a specific circumstance to lead the evidence necessary to establish that circumstance. Because of the presumption of innocence, a criminal trial is different. The entire burden of establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, all facts necessary to a conclusion of guilt rests with the Crown from beginning to end. The presumption of innocence, however, ends with the conclusion by the trial court that the accused person is guilty of the offence as charged. From then on, any position that is pleaded or relied upon is dealt with on the basis of the normal principle that the party pleading or relying upon a specific factual circumstance has the burden of leading the evidence necessary to establish it.\n[100] It should be noted that the Court's comments in Noseworthy were made in the criminal law context. The Court noted that the Criminal Code does not impose a general duty on a trial judge to inquire into an individual's ability to pay, except in limited circumstances. In contrast, subsection 54(1.1) mandates that the Tribunal consider the respondent's ability to pay before levying a fine. That said, we are of the view that the Court's comments regarding the burden of proof relating to the ability to pay are equally applicable to our deliberations under this provision of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[101] In this case, there is some evidence before us, albeit evidence that is unsworn and untested by cross-examination, to suggest that Mr. Kyburz may have limited resources. Because of the way the evidence was adduced, we do not feel that we can attribute it much weight, although we have considered it. We have also taken into account the fact that this is evidently a 'first offence' for Mr. Kyburz. While the seriousness of the section 13 breach would otherwise call for a fine at or near the maximum permissible under the legislation, these factors have persuaded the Tribunal that a somewhat reduced penalty is appropriate. Having regard to all of the circumstances enunciated in subsection 54(1.1), we order that Mr. Kyburz pay a penalty in the amount of $7,500.\n[102] Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order, payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 35 days of Mr. Kyburz being notified of this decision.\nB. The Section 14.1 Complaint (i) Cease and Desist Order [103] Remedies with respect to violations of section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act are governed by section 53 of the Act. Where the Tribunal deems it appropriate to do so, subsection 53(2)(a) empowers the Tribunal to order the respondent to cease the discriminatory practice.\n[104] Mr. Kyburz is ordered to cease and desist from retaliating against Mr. Warman for having filed his human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. This order covers retaliatory conduct including, but not limited to, e-mail communication and web postings, whether on the Patriots on Guard web forum or elsewhere on the Internet, that is similar to the material contained in Exhibits HR-1 and HR-2. Mr. Kyburz is further ordered to cease threatening Mr. Warman, or attempting to interfere with Mr. Warman's employment, whether it be through the use of the Internet, or by other means.\n[105] Unlike the dismantling of the web forum, which requires some positive action on the part of Mr. Kyburz, we see no reason to delay the effect of this portion of our order. Mr. Kyburz is directed to cease his retaliatory activity immediately upon becoming aware of the Tribunal's decision.\n(ii) Compensation for Pain and Suffering [106] Subsection 53(2)(e) allows the Tribunal to make an award of up to $20,000 to compensate the victim of a discriminatory practice for any pain and suffering that he experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice. In this case, the Commission asks that Richard Warman be awarded the maximum award permissible under the legislation.\n[107] Certainly, the retaliatory actions taken by Mr. Kyburz in this case were very serious. Not only did Mr. Kyburz repeatedly disparage Mr. Warman publicly in the most negative terms, it appears that he actively attempted to interfere with Mr. Warman's employment, going so far as seeking to have him fired from his job. Even more worrisome are the veiled threats that Mr. Kyburz made to Mr. Warman's life.\n[108] It was clear from his testimony that Mr. Warman was somewhat shaken by his experiences with Mr. Kyburz. He described the fear that he felt for his own safety, as well as for the safety of those close to him. He also testified to the impact that Mr. Kyburz' retaliatory actions have had on his day-to-day life, and the measures that he has felt it necessary to take for his own safety, which have included involving the police.\n[109] That said, Mr. Warman strikes the Tribunal as a resilient individual, who was clearly on something of a personal mission to stop people such as Mr. Kyburz from disseminating their vitriol over the Web. It appears that Mr. Warman's conviction as to the justness of his cause has served to insulate him somewhat from the negative effects that Mr. Kyburz' actions may have otherwise had on a less strong individual. In this regard we note that there is no medical or other evidence before us that would suggest that Mr. Warman has suffered any health-related consequences as a result of Mr. Kyburz' actions.\n[110] In all of the circumstances, we are of the view that an award of $15,000 for Mr. Warman's pain and suffering is appropriate.\n(iii) Interest [111] Interest shall be paid on the monies awarded pursuant to this decision for Mr. Warman's pain and suffering, in accordance with Rule 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure. Interest will start to run from the date of this decision to the date of payment. In no case, however, should the total amount payable on account of pain and suffering, including interest, exceed $20,000. (32)\n(iv) Special Compensation [112] Although subsection 53(3) of the Act allows for an award of special compensation in relation to the violation of section 14.1, no such remedy was requested here, and none is being awarded.\nVIII. ORDER [113] For the foregoing reasons, we declare that Mr. Warman's rights under the Canadian Human Rights Act have been contravened by Fred Kyburz, and order in relation to the section 13 violation that:\nFred Kyburz, and any other individuals who act in concert with Mr. Kyburz cease the discriminatory practice of communicating telephonically or causing to be communicated telephonically by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, matters of the type contained in Exhibits HR-1 and HR-2, or any other messages of a substantially similar content, that are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, contrary to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. This order includes the requirement that Mr. Kyburz cease publicizing the Patriots on Guard web site material now posted on the Archive.org web site, or referring anyone to the Archive.org web site; Mr. Kyburz shall have seven days from the date on which he is notified of the Tribunal's decision to shut down the Patriots on Guard web forum. The Tribunal further orders that Mr. Kyburz cease and desist from posting any new Internet communications of the type which form the subject matter of the section 13 complaint, whether on the Patriots on Guard web forum or elsewhere on the Internet, immediately upon being notified of the Tribunal's decision; Mr. Kyburz shall pay to Mr. Warman the sum of $15,000 as special compensation, pursuant to subsection 54(1)(b) of the Act; Interest shall be paid on the monies awarded to Mr. Warman as special compensation, in accordance with Rule 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure. Interest will start to run from the date of this decision to the date of payment. In no case, however, should the total amount payable on account of special compensation, including interest, exceed $20,000; and Mr. Kyburz shall pay a penalty in the amount of $7,500. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order, payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 35 days of Mr. Kyburz being notified of this decision.\nWith respect to the section 14.1 violation, the Tribunal orders that:\nImmediately upon becoming aware of the Tribunal's decision, Mr. Kyburz shall cease and desist from retaliating against Mr. Warman for having filed his human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. This order covers conduct including, but not limited to, e-mail communication and web postings, whether on the Patriots on Guard web forum or elsewhere on the Internet, that is similar to the material contained in Exhibits HR-1 and HR-2. Mr. Kyburz is further ordered to cease threatening Mr. Warman, or attempting to interfere with Mr. Warman's employment. Mr. Kyburz shall pay to Mr. Warman the sum of $15,000 for Mr. Warman's pain and suffering; and Interest shall be paid on the monies awarded to Mr. Warman for his pain and suffering, in accordance with Rule 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure. Interest will start to run from the date of this decision to the date of payment. In no case, however, should the total amount payable on account of pain and suffering, including interest, exceed $20,000.\n(Original signed by)\nAnne L.

Mr. Warman explained that Archive.org is a service established by an American university with the stated goal of collecting and cataloging as much of the World Wide Web as possible. There is no indication that Mr. Kyburz asked to have his material archived by Archive.org.

Regardless of whether the letter was actually sent to the Chief Justice or not, by posting a copy on the web forum, where Mr. Kyburz knew that Mr. Warman and others would see it, Mr. Kyburz clearly intended to upset Mr. Warman, and to damage his reputation, in violation of section 14.1.\n24.24 See Exhibit HR-2, Tab 50\n25.25 2003 FCT 341\n26.26 Canada (Attorney General) v.

Grant Sinclair, Chair\nPierre Deschamps, Member\n[1] On December 30, 2002, the Tribunal ordered that Bell Canada disclose all documents relating to the Joint Study located at 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re, Montreal, and produce these documents to the other parties, except for those documents for which Bell may claim privilege. The Tribunal subsequently ordered that CHRC, CEP and Femmes-Actions disclose and produce all documents in their possession relating to the Joint Study, except documents for which privilege was claimed. In the final tally, out of a total of 1,810 documents disclosed, Bell claimed privilege for 13 documents; CEP, 3 out of a total of approximately 148 documents disclosed; and CHRC and Femmes-Actions, none.\n[2] The documents for which Bell claims privilege are listed in Schedule III of Bell's List of Documents as follows:\nlitigation and collective bargaining privilege: 1490, 1493, 1500, 1501, 1732, 1746; collective bargaining privilege: 1484, 1494, 1495, 1498; litigation, collective bargaining, settlement privilege: 1752, 1753 and 1787.\n[3] CEP claims settlement privilege for document numbers 21, 53 and 83 listed in Schedule 3 to its List of Documents.\n[4] The Tribunal was given copies of and has reviewed the Bell and CEP documents for which privilege has been claimed. There is no disagreement among the parties as to the applicable tests for each privilege. Rather, the dispute is whether, on the facts, the documents are subject to the privilege claimed.\nI. LITIGATION PRIVILEGE [5] To succeed in its claim for litigation privilege, Bell must satisfy all of the following tests:\nthe communication must have been produced with litigation in mind; the communication must have been produced for the dominant purpose of receiving legal advice or as an aid to the conduct of litigation; the prospect of litigation must be reasonable.\n[6] Bell pointed out that for those documents concerning CEP jobs (1490, 1493, 1500, 1501, 1732) there was no formal litigation between Bell and CEP at the time these documents were created. CEP systemic complaints were filed in 1994. But, Bell argues, it could be reasonably anticipated that, if no agreement was reached on correcting the wage gap, CEP would file complaints with the Commission.\n[7] With respect to CTEA document 1746, at the time this document was created, there were individual CTEA member complaints filed with the Commission and group complaints filed by CTEA. In this situation, Bell argues that there was outstanding litigation or at least it was reasonable to anticipate that litigation would ensue between Bell and CTEA, absent any agreement on wage gap.\n[8] The Tribunal finds that Bell has not satisfied all of the tests required pertaining to litigation privilege. In particular, it is our opinion that these documents were not created for the dominant purpose of receiving legal advice or as an aid to the conduct of litigation. Rather, the facts show that they were created for the purpose of determining the extent of the wage gap in relation to the results of the Joint Study submitted to Bell management, CTEA and CEP. The results were to be used by the respective bargaining committees in an attempt to deal with the wage gap identified in the Joint Study.\nII. SETTLEMENT PRIVILEGE [9] In order for settlement privilege to apply, the party invoking such privilege has the burden of establishing that:\na litigious dispute is in existence or is within contemplation; the communication must be made with the express or implied intention that it would not be disclosed to the court in the event negotiations failed;\nthe purpose of the communication must be to effect settlement.\n[10] Bell invokes settlement privilege with respect to CTEA documents 1752, 1753 and 1787. Bell has consistently taken the position that the Joint Study results were to be shared by the respective bargaining committees of the parties. Any wage gap identified by the Joint Study was to be addressed through collective bargaining. We have concluded that the CTEA documents for which Bell claims settlement privilege were prepared in this context and not for the purpose of effecting a settlement in a litigious dispute. In our opinion, the collective bargaining process contemplated by the parties does not amount to settlement negotiations.\nIII. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PRIVILEGE [11] The Commission and CEP disputed that such a privilege exists in Canadian law. But if such a privilege is recognized, all parties agreed that, for collective bargaining privilege to apply, all four of the Wigmore criteria must be met:\nthe communication must originate in a confidence; the confidence must be essential to the relationship in which the communication arises; the relationship must be one which should be sedulously fostered in the public good. the court must consider whether the interests served by protecting the communications from disclosure outweigh the interest in getting at the truth and disposing correctly of the litigation.\n[12] On the basis of our review of these documents, namely, 1484, 1490, 1493, 1494, 1495, 1498, 1500, 1501, 1732, 1746, 1752, 1753 and 1787, we have concluded that only document 1484 satisfies all of the Wigmore criteria.\n[13] Document 1484 is an internal memorandum from Mich\u00e8le Boyer of Bell's Pay Equity Group to Diane Long, Bell's chief bargaining representative. The substance of this memorandum, dated March 16, 1992, deals with various strategies of Bell relating to pay equity issues in the context of collective bargaining.\n[14] Documents 1490, 1500, 1501, 1732, 1746 and 1787 contain tables and graphs relating to various costing scenarios, some referring to CEP jobs and some referring to CTEA jobs. They refer to wage rates effective at different dates. The tables and graphs found in documents 1490, 1500, 1732, 1746 and 1787 are very similar to those found in HR-76 and HR-73. As for the costing scenarios found in document 1501, they are identical to the costing scenarios found in the HR-76 at pages 1247, 1249 and 1251.\n[15] Document 1493 contains a costing of total Bell pay equity liability using the same 1993\/06\/01 wage rates as are found on page 1244 of HR-76 relating to pay line gaps. As for document 1752, it compares the male and female pay lines and establishes the percentage and dollar wage gap as of 1992\/11\/25 for the 98 benchmark jobs using the same wage rates found on page 1244, HR-76.\n[16] Document 1753 is similar to document 1752 except for the fact that the wage rates are as of 1992\/12\/01 instead of 1992\/11\/25.\n[17] Document 1494 lists on its first page the female dominated jobs to be adjusted in CEP bargaining group. The second page contains a table which reflects the total cost of the 1993 pay equity adjustment for CEP employees if a 0.919% increase is given to female dominated jobs.\n[18] Document 1495 contains on its first page a count of CEP employees excluding students as of December 31, 1992, June 30, 1993, as well as calculations. The second page contains a table which reflects the total cost of the 1993 pay equity adjustment for CEP employees if a 1% increase is awarded to benchmark female dominated jobs.\n[19] Documents 1494 and 1495 have costing scenarios using the same wage rates set out on page 11 of document 1490 and at page 1244 in HR-76.\n[20] The first page of document 1498 is identical to the first page of document 1495. As for the second page, it contains a handwritten count of CEP employees including students as of June 1993 and December 1992.\n[21] Assuming that Bell has satisfied the first three Wigmore tests, our review of the documents as set out above, shows that the documents are either identical, very similar or closely related to documents already in evidence. When balancing the interests as mandated by Wigmore test four, we conclude that the interests of justice are best served by production of these documents.\nIV. CEP SETTLEMENT PRIVILEGE CLAIM [22] Documents 21, 53 and 83 found in the CEP's Schedule 3 List are handwritten notes made by Patricia Blackstaffe. Document 21 is a two page document, dated October 11, 1994. Document 53 is a four page document, dated May 24, 1994. Document 83 is a 17-page document, dated April 14, 1994.\n[23] We have reviewed these documents. They were created after the filing of systemic complaints by the CEP and within the context of mediation. Litigation existed at the time they were created. The content of these documents shows that they were not intended to be disclosed if there was no settlement. Accordingly, we conclude that documents 21, 53 and 83 are privileged.\nV. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT [24] After discussion, the parties reached agreement regarding terms of disclosure\/production of certain documents prepared by Bell comprising wage gap calculations and estimates over a specified period of time. Those documents which are covered by this agreement and the terms of the agreement are specified in Exhibit T-5. The Tribunal accepts Exhibit T-5 as part of this Ruling and as an appropriate resolution of the production\/privilege issues relating to these particular concerns.\nOriginal signed by\nJ.

ORDER\n[1] During her nearly nine years of employment as a bus operator with the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission (OC Transpo), Francine Desormeaux was frequently absent from work. Her absences were caused by a variety of health problems including migraine headaches, kidney stones, gall bladder problems, ovarian cysts, viruses, a broken ankle, a back injury, bronchitis and stress. After numerous warnings from her employer, Ms. Desormeaux's employment with OC Transpo was terminated because of her chronic innocent absenteeism. Ms. Desormeaux alleges that this constitutes discrimination on the basis of disability, contrary to the provisions of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nI. MS. DESORMEAUX'S EMPLOYMENT WITH OC TRANSPO [2] After working for a number of years as a supervisor in a child care facility, Francine Desormeaux began work as a bus operator at OC Transpo in March of 1989. OC Transpo provides public transit in the National Capital Region.\n[3] Ms. Desormeaux says that she went through a period of adjustment, as she became used to driving a bus for her employer. Working in public transit presents a number of challenges for new employees, as they become used to dealing with the public, navigating the city and operating large vehicles. As junior employees, new drivers also get the least attractive shifts, including split shifts, as well as night and weekend work.\n[4] Despite these challenges, Ms. Desormeaux successfully completed an initial probationary period, and drove for OC Transpo for a number of years without any major incidents. It appears that apart from the issue of the frequency of her absences from work, Ms. Desormeaux was a good bus driver. She clearly enjoyed working with the public, and was generally a competent and reliable employee. Ms. Desormeaux's level of attendance was, however, a matter of concern to her employer, virtually from the day that she started working for OC Transpo.\nA. Ms. Desormeaux's Attendance History [5] Ms. Desormeaux reviewed OC Transpo's records of her attendance, in conjunction with the diaries that she kept throughout the period of her employment. In so doing, she was able to identify the reasons for most of her absences from work. Her testimony in this regard is summarized in the following table:\nTotal Days Absent from Work Migraine-related Absences Significant Periods of Absence for Other Medical Reasons\n1989 (from March 28) 21 full days 2 part days 9 full days 2 part days 6 full days - bronchitis 6 full days - minor gynaecological surgery\n1990 16 full days 4 part days 8 full days 1 part day 6 full days, 2 part days - bronchitis 2 full days - gall bladder\n1991 34 full days 2 part days 2 full days\n3 full days - bronchitis 16 full days - gall bladder\n10 full days, 1 part day - surgery - wisdom teeth\n3 full days, 1 part day - sprained ankle\n1992 52 full days 1 part day 3 full days 41 full days - gall bladder 5 full days - stomach flu\n1993 96 full days 1 part day 2 full days 1 part day 8 full days - bronchitis\/flu 79 full days - back injury\n1994 26 full days 1 part day 7 full days 1 part day (1) 12 full days - back injury\n1995 52 full days 5 part days 3 full days 2 part days 12 full days, 1 part day - ovarian cyst 32 full days - broken ankle (injury on duty)\n1996 24 full days 7 part days 6 full days 3 part days 15 full days - 1 part day - ovarian cyst\n1997 41 full days 1 part days 14 full days 1 part day 21 full days - kidney stones\n1998 (to Jan.30) 3 full days 3 full days\nTotal 365 full days 24 part days 57 full days 11 part days\n[6] It is evident from Ms. Desormeaux's testimony that the above table does not reflect the full extent of her absenteeism. There were several occasions when Ms. Desormeaux was ill, and unable to work, where she entered into an informal arrangement with a co-worker to cover for her. Under this arrangement, the co-worker would report to work in Ms. Desormeaux's stead. Ms. Desormeaux then paid her co-worker directly for the day worked. Ms. Desormeaux estimates that this occurred on three or four occasions. It is common ground that this practice was contrary to the policies of OC Transpo.\nB. How Did OC Transpo Deal With Ms. Desormeaux's Absenteeism? [7] Having its employees attend work on a regular and reliable basis is clearly important to OC Transpo, which delivers time-sensitive public transport. In an effort to manage employee absenteeism, OC Transpo has had a number of attendance management policies over time.\n[8] Ron Marcotte was Ms. Desormeaux's supervisor at the time that her employment with OC Transpo was terminated. He explained that during the early years of Ms. Desormeaux's employment with OC Transpo, excessive absenteeism was treated in the same way that other performance problems were dealt with: that is, as a disciplinary matter. Employees who were chronically absent from work were subject to progressive discipline, with sanctions ranging from reprimands up to and including dismissal. This view of chronic innocent absenteeism as a disciplinary matter is evident in the way in which Ms. Desormeaux's absenteeism was managed in the early stages of her career.\n[9] As previously noted, Ms. Desormeaux's absenteeism was a matter of concern to OC Transpo from the time that she started working for the organization. Ms. Desormeaux met with Chris Walton, who was the Operations Relations Officer and Ms. Desormeaux's supervisor, for a probationary evaluation on October 27, 1989. The appraisal document indicates that there were no concerns with respect to Ms. Desormeaux's performance, apart from her absenteeism. As of October, 1989, Ms. Desormeaux had missed 20 full or part days of work. According to the document, Mr. Walton spoke to Ms. Desormeaux about her attendance during the course of her evaluation meeting.\n[10] It appears from the documentation that Mr. Walton told Ms. Desormeaux on February 23, 1990 that serious consideration was being given to terminating her employment. In this and subsequent meetings, Ms. Desormeaux assured Mr. Walton that her attendance would improve.\n[11] By April of 1990, Ms. Desormeaux had been absent from work on 13 occasions, for a total of 37 full and part days. Mr. Walton again met with Ms. Desormeaux to discuss her unsatisfactory level of attendance. At the time that Ms. Desormeaux was notified of the meeting, Mr. Walton advised her that Due to the seriousness of this matter a decision on your future employment will be made. Ms. Desormeaux testified that she discussed the difficulties that she was having in adjusting to working at OC Transpo. She also told Mr. Walton about her migraine headaches and other health problems. Despite OC Transpo's concerns, Ms. Desormeaux successfully completed her probationary period, and was made a permanent employee. She was advised, however, that her attendance would be monitored on a regular basis.\n[12] Three months later, Ms. Desormeaux was given a one day suspension because of her absenteeism, and because she was involved in a minor accident. This suspension was imposed after another meeting with Mr. Walton, in the course of which Ms. Desormeaux again referred to her migraines. Ms. Desormeaux also advised Mr. Walton about problems that she was experiencing with her gall bladder, which would likely require surgery in the future. Ms. Desormeaux grieved this suspension, claiming that the majority of her absences were illness-related. In the course of the first level grievance hearing, Ms. Desormeaux's union argued that Ms. Desormeaux was experiencing severe migraine headaches, that she was receiving medical attention for the problem, and that she had scheduled all of her medical appointments outside of her working hours. An OC Transpo representative explained that Ms. Desormeaux's frequent absences created difficulties, as there were not always enough staff available to replace her. Ron Marcotte, who was then the Assistant Superintendent of Operating Personnel, was also in attendance at the grievance meeting. His notes indicate that:\nMs. Desormeaux was advised that the situation was of her own doing. It was also noted that there were various options open to her at OC Transpo should she want to seek assistance. It was stressed that the Commission was not trying to terminate her but are trying to put her career on the right path.\nIt appears that the only option identified to Ms. Desormeaux with respect to the assistance available to her at OC Transpo was the Employee Assistance Program (EAP).\n[13] This grievance was resolved on the basis that if Ms. Desormeaux was not absent from work on more than five occasions, or for more than 12 days over the next 12 months, and did not have another accident for which she was at fault, consideration would be given to reducing the suspension. Ms. Desormeaux testified that Mr. Walton told her that she would have to do whatever it took to get herself to work. It was recognized that Ms. Desormeaux might require surgery for her gallstones, and she was instructed to contact Mr. Walton in order to make arrangements for this absence.\n[14] It should be noted that this was the only occasion during Ms. Desormeaux's employment with OC Transpo when she was given a specific attendance target. Ms. Desormeaux met this target, although she says that to do so, she reported to work on occasion while taking Tylenol 3. Tylenol 3 contains codeine, and driving while taking it is contraindicated.\n[15] Ms. Desormeaux was interviewed regarding her attendance on December 9, 1992 and again on July 20, 1993. There is little information as to what was discussed in the course of these meetings.\n[16] On June 19, 1994, OC Transpo's policy regarding the Employment of Disabled Employees came into effect. This policy, which reflects a shift away from the disciplinary treatment of health-related absences, established a protocol for the consideration of requests for accommodation. It is common ground that although this policy remained in effect for a couple of years, Ms. Desormeaux's situation was never addressed in accordance with the policy, as no one, including Ms. Desormeaux herself, considered her to be disabled.\n[17] On July 11, 1994, Ms. Desormeaux met with Ron Marcotte, who had by this point replaced Mr. Walton as Ms. Desormeaux's supervisor. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss Ms. Desormeaux's unacceptable level of attendance. The contemporaneous documentation indicates that Ms. Desormeaux advised Mr. Marcotte that her absences were primarily due to her migraine headaches and the personal problems that she was experiencing at the time. Ms. Desormeaux was again warned that more serious discipline could be imposed if her level of attendance did not improve, and was once again referred to the EAP for assistance.\n[18] Mr. Marcotte met with Ms. Desormeaux again on December 6, 1995, to discuss her attendance. Rob Vye, Ms. Desormeaux's union representative, was also present at this meeting. Mr. Marcotte noted that if Ms. Desormeaux's absences for compensable injuries were excluded, her level of attendance had improved somewhat. Nevertheless, he advised Ms. Desormeaux that her attendance was still unacceptable, and cautioned her that if her level of attendance did not improve, the issue of her medical fitness to continue working would have to be addressed. A similar discussion took place between Ms. Desormeaux and Mr. Marcotte on August 29, 1996.\n[19] In November of 1996, OC Transpo introduced a new attendance management policy. Amongst other things, the purpose of this policy was to reduce absenteeism, while making every reasonable effort to provide assistance, accommodation, and rehabilitation to employees, and to provide employees with clear and fair communication of the employer's attendance expectations. In cases of illness or injury, the program required supervisors to ascertain from an independent medical consultant whether the employee in question suffered from a 'disability', within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which required accommodation. The policy also advised supervisors to try to get employees to agree to a defined reasonable level of attendance for the future, suggesting that the plant average for absenteeism is a reasonable standard. Article 8 of the policy provides that, before terminating the employment of an individual for chronic innocent absenteeism, OC Transpo must be satisfied that, amongst other things, ... an honest effort has been made to accommodate the involved employee.\n[20] This attendance management program contemplated a more pro-active approach to managing employee absenteeism than did its predecessor. In accordance with this approach, employees whose absenteeism rate put them in the top 25 percent of the OC Transpo workforce were contacted with respect to their absenteeism, and many were interviewed regarding the situation. In this context, in March of 1997, OC Transpo bus operators, including Ms. Desormeaux, were notified that the absenteeism rate for the first months of 1997 was up 30% over the same period in 1996. Drivers who had been absent in the first three months of 1997 were advised that excessive absenteeism was threatening to compromise OC Transpo's ability to meet its service requirements, and were reminded of the necessity of regular attendance.\n[21] On September 29, 1997, Ms. Desormeaux and Mr. Vye met again with Mr. Marcotte. Although Mr. Marcotte did not question the legitimacy of Ms. Desormeaux's absences, he was concerned as to her medical fitness to work on a regular and reliable basis. Ms. Desormeaux testified that she asked Mr. Marcotte to tell her precisely how many days a year that she would be allowed to miss. It is common ground that Mr. Marcotte refused to do so, telling Ms. Desormeaux that her rate of attendance would simply have to improve.\n[22] Because of his concerns with respect to Ms. Desormeaux's fitness for work, Mr. Marcotte invoked Article 15.3 of the collective agreement in force between OC Transpo and the Amalgamated Transit Union, of which Ms. Desormeaux was a member. This Article allows OC Transpo to request that an employee provide a certificate from her doctor attesting to her fitness for work, where the employer has reasonable grounds for believing that the employee may be medically unfit to work on a regular basis. The collective agreement further contemplates that the employer may not be satisfied with the medical certificate provided by an employee. In such circumstances, the employee can be asked to provide a further certificate from a physician selected by OC Transpo. Mr. Marcotte explained that he was not seeking information about Ms. Desormeaux's diagnosis, but rather about the prognosis for attendance at work in the future.\n[23] In order to safeguard the confidentiality of employee medical information, requests of this nature are routed through OC Transpo's Occupational Health unit. On September 30, 1997, Louise Culham, an Occupational Nurse, wrote Ms. Desormeaux, asking her to provide a letter from her physician, giving an opinion as to Ms. Desormeaux's ability to perform work on a regular basis. Ms. Culham asked Ms. Desormeaux to have her doctor consider the following questions:\nDo you have a medical condition that could cause your attendance to be in excess of reasonableness? Is your problem of a temporary or chronic nature? What is the prognosis that you can perform your duties on a regular full-time basis?\n[24] Ms. Desormeaux's family doctor, Dr. Anne Meehan, responded to OC Transpo's request by letter dated October 16, 1997. Dr. Meehan's letter states:\n... during the past year [Ms. Desormeaux] has had a few problems which have necessitated an absence from work. The first problem related to migraine headaches. Over time we have resolved that these are related to mechanical neck dysfunction. As a result, she has begun a program of regular neck exercises, as well as physiotherapy, which have significantly reduced both the severity and frequency of her headaches.\nThe other problem which arose this past year was one of a renal calculi. The problem has resolved and is not likely to become an ongoing problem. Finally, Ms. Desormeaux is being investigated for a possible mass on her ovary. She is under the care of Dr. Treehuba for the investigation and potential treatment. This ovarian abnormality is not causing her any problem at the present.\nHence, in response to your specific questions, the only problem among the above list which is possibly of a longer-term nature is that of migraines. In view of the definite improvement Ms. Desormeaux has experienced through her own efforts, and through physiotherapy, I do not anticipate that they will significantly interfere with her ability to perform her duties on a regular full-time basis. Both the renal calculi and the ovarian problem are isolated events and unlikely to become chronic or to recur ...\nDr. Meehan was not specifically asked whether Ms. Desormeaux suffered from a disability, and consequently, her letter did not address this issue. There is no indication in Dr. Meehan's letter that Ms. Desormeaux required any form of accommodation in the workplace.\n[25] Louise Culham subsequently advised Mr. Marcotte that:\n[Ms. Desormeaux] does possibly have a problem which is of a longer-term nature. However, in view of the definite improvement Ms. Desormeaux has experienced through her own efforts, her physician did not feel that this should significantly interfere with her ability to perform her duties on a regular full-time basis.\nAlthough Dr. Meehan's stated that Ms. Desormeaux suffered from a condition that could have longer-term implications, no one from OC Transpo followed up with Dr. Meehan, nor was any attempt made to obtain an independent medical assessment of Ms. Desormeaux.\n[26] The evidence suggests that OC Transpo would handle an employee in Ms. Desormeaux's situation quite differently today. Lois Emberg was OC Transpo's Employment Equity Co-Ordinator at the time, and had responsibility for human rights and employment equity. According to Ms. Emberg, if a letter such as the one from Dr. Meehan was received from an employee's doctor now, OC Transpo's staff physician would likely follow up on Dr. Meehan's letter, and an effort would be made to determine whether the employee suffered from a disability. Consideration would also be given to whether the employee needed accommodation, and what could be done in this regard.\n[27] Ms. Desormeaux, Mr. Vye and Mr. Marcotte met again on November 6, 1997(2), in order to discuss the results of the medical inquiry and Ms. Desormeaux's prognosis for regular and reliable attendance at work. Ms. Desormeaux testified that she told Mr. Marcotte that she was doing everything that she possibly could to attend work regularly. She says that she again asked Mr. Marcotte to specify how many days' absence could be tolerated, and that he declined to do so, telling her only that he wanted to see a substantial improvement in her attendance.\n[28] Ms. Desormeaux testified that in the course of this meeting, Mr. Vye told Mr. Marcotte that Ms. Desormeaux's migraines could constitute a disability, and suggested that they look at ways in which Ms. Desormeaux could be accommodated. Mr. Marcotte agrees that the question of whether Ms. Desormeaux was disabled was raised by Mr. Vye at some point, although he was uncertain if the issue was raised at this meeting. Mr. Vye did not testify. There is no mention of any such discussion in the documentation prepared by Mr. Marcotte with respect to this meeting.\n[29] I accept Ms. Desormeaux's testimony in this regard, and find that on November 6, 1997, OC Transpo was made aware that Ms. Desormeaux potentially suffered from a disability. Mr. Marcotte testified that he had between 300 and 350 employees under his supervision in 1998, and that over the course of his career at OC Transpo, he conducted somewhere between 700 and 800 performance-related employee interviews. It is therefore not surprising that he was unable to recall when the issue first arose. Given that her employment was in issue, this meeting was obviously of greater importance to Ms. Desormeaux than it was to Mr. Marcotte, and her recollection as to the timing of Mr. Vye's comments is thus more likely to be reliable. Ms. Desormeaux says that Mr. Marcotte was 'not hearing' what Mr. Vye was saying, and thus it is not surprising that the discussion was not mentioned in the documentation relating to this meeting. From Ms. Desormeaux's testimony it does not appear that the issue of accommodation was explored in the course of this meeting.\n[30] According to Ms. Desormeaux, Mr. Marcotte closed the meeting by saying I don't want to have to call you back in here next September for another meeting. She understood from this that she had another year to try to improve her attendance.\n[31] Mr. Marcotte's letter documenting this meeting refers to the assurances given by Ms. Desormeaux regarding the steps that she was taking to control her migraines, and states Further, I am encouraged to hear that you realize that you can take actions on your own to assist in controlling your problems and that it is solely up to you.\n[32] Although the disability issue was raised during the November 6 meeting, Mr. Marcotte did not follow the procedure set out in the Attendance Management Program. He did not send Ms. Desormeaux for an independent medical assessment in order to ascertain whether Ms. Desormeaux did indeed suffer from a 'disability' within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Similarly, he did not ask that Dr. Meehan be consulted with respect to this question.\n[33] Between November 6, 1997, and the termination of her employment on January 30, 1998, Ms. Desormeaux was absent from work on four separate occasions for a total of seven full days. Ms. Desormeaux says that all of these absences were attributable to migraine headaches. She explained that she was taking Norgesic Forte, a very powerful medication, for these headaches, and could not have safely driven a bus. Each of these absences was documented by an OC Transpo absence form, signed by Dr. Meehan, indicating the reason for the absence.\n[34] Ms. Desormeaux was also late for work on two occasions in this period, as a result of having slept in.\nC. The Termination of Ms. Desormeaux's Employment [35] On January 30, 1998, Ms. Desormeaux and Mr. Vye met with Mr. Marcotte and Mr. Walton, at which time Ms. Desormeaux was advised that her employment with OC Transpo was being terminated. Ms. Desormeaux stated that she was shocked, as she thought that she had another year to prove herself.\n[36] Mr. Walton's contemporaneous notes of the meeting confirm that Ms. Desormeaux told Mr. Marcotte and Mr. Walton that all of her recent absences had been due to migraines. According to Ms. Desormeaux, Mr. Vye again suggested that her headaches constituted a disability and that OC Transpo should look at ways to accommodate her. Ms. Desormeaux says that Mr. Marcotte responded by saying that OC Transpo's decision would stand.\n[37] Mr. Marcotte agrees that the issue of Ms. Desormeaux suffering from a disability that required accommodation was raised by Mr. Vye during this meeting. Mr. Walton's notes record Mr. Marcotte responding by stating that while some of Ms. Desormeaux's absences may have been due to migraines, she had also missed substantial periods of work for other reasons. Mr. Marcotte testified that he did not have any information from OC Transpo's health unit to indicate that there was a need to explore possible accommodative measures. Similarly, Mr. Marcotte says that he had no information suggesting that there was a need to obtain an independent medical assessment.\n[38] Based upon the opinion provided by Dr. Meehan, Mr. Marcotte stated that in November of 1997, OC Transpo's expectation was that Ms. Desormeaux would be able to provide regular and reliable attendance in the future. According to Mr. Marcotte, Dr. Meehan's opinion indicated that there was no impediment to Ms. Desormeaux's attending work on a regular basis. In the weeks following the November 6 meeting, Ms. Desormeaux was absent from work on several occasions, totaling 7 full and 2 part days. This led the employer to conclude that the prognosis for reliable future attendance by Ms. Desormeaux was very poor. Thus the decision was made to terminate her employment for chronic innocent absenteeism.\nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK [39] Ms. Desormeaux's complaint is brought pursuant to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 7 makes it a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ someone on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 3 of the Act designates disability as a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[40] Pursuant to section 15(1)(a) of the Act, it is not a discriminatory practice to treat an employee in a differential fashion, where the differential treatment is based upon a bona fide occupational requirement.\n[41] Counsel for OC Transpo submits that the standard of proof in a human rights case is something higher than the ordinary civil standard of balance of probabilities, relying on the decision of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench in Berry v. Farm Meats Canada Ltd.(3) as authority for this proposition. I disagree. At the federal level, the standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. (4)\n[42] OC Transpo further contends that arbitral jurisprudence affirms the right of an employer to receive its part of the employment bargain, that is, to have an employee provide work in exchange for compensation. While arbitrators do take human rights principles into consideration, counsel says, nevertheless, employment contracts may be frustrated through no fault of the individual employee.\n[43] The interface between human rights and arbitral jurisprudence was discussed in the recent decision of this Tribunal in Eyerley v. Seaspan International Ltd.(5), and I adopt the reasoning in that case. Labour relations concepts do not operate freely, but are constrained by human rights legislation.\n[44] The Supreme Court of Canada revisited the approach to be taken in human rights cases in its decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU(6) ('Meiorin') and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (7) ('Grismer'). The historic distinction between direct and indirect discrimination has been replaced by a unified approach to the adjudication of human rights complaints. Under this approach, the initial onus is still on a complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made, and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent.(8)\n[45] Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the onus shifts to the respondent to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the discriminatory standard or policy is a bona fide occupational requirement. In order to establish this, the respondent must now prove that:\ni) it adopted the standard for a purpose that is rationally connected to the performance of the job;\nii) it adopted the standard in good faith, in the belief that it is necessary for the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and\nii) the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate an individual employee sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship on the employer.(9)\n[46] The term 'undue hardship' is not defined in the Act, however, Meiorin and Grismer provide considerable guidance in determining whether or not an undue hardship defense has been made out. In Meiorin, the Supreme Court observed that the use of the word 'undue' implies that some hardship is acceptable - it is only 'undue' hardship that will satisfy the test. (10) The Supreme Court has further observed that in order to prove that a standard is reasonably necessary, a respondent always bears the burden of demonstrating that the standard incorporates every possible accommodation to the point of undue hardship.(11) It is incumbent on the respondent to show that it has considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation. The onus is on the respondent to prove that incorporating aspects of individual accommodation within the standard was impossible short of undue hardship.(12) In assessing the adequacy of the respondent's efforts to accommodate, regard may be had to the prospect of substantial interference with the rights of others. (13) The adoption of the respondent's standard has to be supported by convincing evidence. Impressionistic evidence will not generally suffice. (14) Finally, factors such as the financial cost of methods of accommodation should be applied with common sense and flexibility in the context of the factual situation under consideration.(15)\n[47] It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient if the complainant's disability was a factor in the decision to terminate her employment.(16)\nIII. ANALYSIS A. Implications of the Adams Decision [48] The Amalgamated Transit Union grieved the termination of Ms. Desormeaux's employment. The grievance proceeded through an expedited arbitration process, and was heard by the Hon. George Adams, Q.C. on July 27, 1998. On August 5, 1998, Mr. Adams rendered a decision wherein he concluded that OC Transpo had just cause to dismiss Ms. Desormeaux. Accordingly, the grievance was dismissed.\n[49] Prior to the commencement of this hearing, the respondent brought a motion challenging the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on a number of bases. One of the respondent's arguments was that the doctrine of res judicata prohibited the Tribunal from taking jurisdiction over Ms. Desormeaux's complaint due to the application of issue estoppel.\n[50] I dealt with this motion in a preliminary ruling, wherein I found that issue estoppel did not arise in this case, as the issue before Mr. Adams was not the same as the issue before the Tribunal, nor were the parties to the two proceedings the same.\n[51] The arbitration before Mr. Adams proceeded on the basis of an agreed statement of facts. In the course of the Tribunal hearing, counsel for the respondent contended that, in the event that there is an issue regarding any of these facts, I should apply the doctrine of issue estoppel, and take these facts as having been proven in the arbitration proceeding.\n[52] It is not open to the respondent to try to re-litigate an issue that I have already dealt with in my preliminary ruling. I have already decided that I am not bound by the findings of Arbitrator Adams. However, having looked closely at the submissions of counsel for the respondent, it seems that what she is really arguing is that Ms. Desormeaux should not be permitted to resile from admissions made on her behalf at the arbitration.\n[53] I do not find it necessary for me to address this argument, in light of the evidence adduced before me in this hearing, as it does not appear that either the Commission or Ms. Desormeaux take substantial issue with the facts agreed to before Mr. Adams.\nB. What is the Standard? [54] The employment standard in issue in this case is OC Transpo's requirement that its employees attend work on a regular and reliable basis.\nC. Is There a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination? [55] In considering this complaint, I must first determine if Ms. Desormeaux and the Commission have established a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of a disability. The respondent contends that no prima facie case has been established here, as it has not been proven that Ms. Desormeaux suffered from a disability. OC Transpo submits that the evidence does not establish that Ms. Desormeaux suffers from migraine headaches, and that all of the other illnesses and injuries that she has suffered over the years are transitory ailments, and do not rise to the level of disabilities.\n(i) Was Ms. Desormeaux Disabled? [56] Ms. Desormeaux testified that she suffered from chronic headaches for many years prior to being hired by OC Transpo. According to Ms. Desormeaux, her headaches usually start during the night, and begin with neck pain. The pain gradually moves forward into one side of her head. If Ms. Desormeaux stands up while suffering from one of these headaches, she experiences nausea and vomiting. She also becomes very sensitive to light. The headaches have historically occurred once or twice a month, and typically lasted anywhere from one to three days. These headaches persisted throughout the time that Ms. Desormeaux worked for OC Transpo.\n[57] Ms. Desormeaux has frequently sought medical assistance for her headaches. At the time that Ms. Desormeaux joined OC Transpo, she was being treated by her family physician, then Dr. Lyla Graham. In 1990, Dr. Graham referred Ms. Desormeaux to Dr. H. Rabinovitch, a neurologist, for further investigation. Dr. Rabinovitch examined Ms. Desormeaux on January 11, 1990, and subsequently reported his findings to Dr. Graham. Dr. Rabinovitch's report notes I expect that she probably has mixed migraine, tension headaches .... I will arrange for an EEG and CAT scan but I think it is very doubtful that much else will be found ... Ms. Desormeaux says that she underwent both the EEG and the CAT scan, but was never advised of the test results. Her understanding was that she would only be notified if something noteworthy was disclosed by the tests. There is no record of the findings of either test.\n[58] In July of 1996, Ms. Desormeaux changed family doctors, and began seeing Dr. Meehan on a regular basis. Dr. Meehan testified in these proceedings, describing her observations with respect to Ms. Desormeaux's headache condition, as well as the various forms of treatment and types of medication that she prescribed for Ms. Desormeaux over the years.\n[59] According to Dr. Meehan, the symptoms that Ms. Desormeaux described with respect to her headaches were consistent with those Ms. Desormeaux reported to Dr. Rabinovitch in 1990, and are classic symptoms of more severe migrainous-type headaches. Dr. Meehan explained that the cause of migraine headaches is not known, but certain 'triggers' can bring on headaches. Treatment for migraines consists of trying to identify and avoid these triggers, and can include prophylactic medication aimed at preventing recurrences. Various types of analgesic medications are also prescribed to reduce the level of pain quickly and effectively, with as few side effects as possible.\n[60] The treatment of migraine headaches often involves an element of trial and error, according to Dr. Meehan. In Ms. Desormeaux's case, Dr. Meehan recommended that Ms. Desormeaux try physiotherapy to reduce muscle tension in her neck. Reducing neck tension can lessen the severity of migraine headaches. She also had Ms. Desormeaux try a variety of medications, in an effort to identify the most effective form of treatment for the headaches. Because fluctuations in female hormonal levels can often trigger migraine headaches, Dr. Meehan eventually started Ms. Desormeaux on a course of Depo-Provera, medication that suppresses ovulation, and eliminates the menstrual cycles that often trigger migraines. (17)\n[61] Dr. Meehan stated that she did not see any need to refer Ms. Desormeaux to a neurologist for further assessment. According to Dr. Meehan, Ms. Desormeaux had already been assessed by a neurologist, and did not exhibit any symptoms that would cause Dr. Meehan to question the accuracy of Dr. Rabinovitch's diagnosis.\n[62] Since becoming Ms. Desormeaux's family doctor in 1996, Dr. Meehan also treated Ms. Desormeaux for kidney stones, ovarian cysts, a respiratory infection and viral gastroenteritis.\n[63] By the Fall of 1997, when she was asked for an opinion regarding Ms. Desormeaux's fitness for work, Dr. Meehan says that all of Ms. Desormeaux's health problems, apart from the migraines, had resolved, and would not cause any ongoing problems. Insofar as Ms. Desormeaux's migraines were concerned, Dr. Meehan says that they were under better control, but that the nature of Ms. Desormeaux's condition was such that one could not predict when the headaches would occur. Ms. Desormeaux's headaches impaired her ability to perform her job. Further, many of the medications used to treat migraine headaches have side effects that would make driving a bus unsafe.\n[64] The starting point for my determination of whether or not Ms. Desormeaux suffered from a disability must be the definition of 'disability' contained in section 25 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Unfortunately, this section is of limited assistance in this case, in that the definition that it provides is somewhat circular: 'disability' is defined as - any previous or existing mental or physical disability ...\n[65] The most recent judicial pronouncement as to what constitutes a disability is the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montr\u00e9al (City); Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Boisbriand (City).(18) The Supreme Court determined that the term 'handicap', (which is used synonymously with 'disability' in the human rights context)(19), ... must not be confined within a narrow definition that leaves no room for flexibility.(20)\n[66] Counsel for OC Transpo submits that Ms. Desormeaux did not suffer from a disability, contending that it has not been properly established that Ms. Desormeaux in fact suffers from migraine headaches. Counsel submits that diagnosing migraine headaches is beyond the expertise of Dr. Meehan as a family physician. In the absence of a diagnosis by a neurologist, counsel says, I cannot find that Ms. Desormeaux suffers from migraines.\n[67] There are several reasons for rejecting counsel's submission. I am satisfied that the diagnosis and treatment of migraine headaches is within the expertise of the reasonably competent family practitioner. Further, Ms. Desormeaux was assessed by a neurologist in 1990. Dr. Rabinovitch concluded that Ms. Desormeaux probably suffered from mixed migraine, tension headaches. Dr. Meehan testified that Ms. Desormeaux's symptoms were classic symptoms of more severe migrainous-type headaches. There is no medical evidence before me that would lead me to question either Dr. Meehan's opinion or Dr. Rabinovitch's finding.\n[68] Further, even if I were to accept counsel's submission in this regard, I would still find that Ms. Desormeaux's headaches constitute a 'disability' within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act. It is undisputed that Ms. Desormeaux has suffered from chronic, debilitating headaches for many years. Whether these headaches are properly classified as migraines, or some other type of headache, is immaterial. Ms. Desormeaux's description of the symptoms, and the effect that these symptoms, as well as the necessary medication, have on her ability to function has not been challenged. It is clear that she has long suffered from a chronic headache condition that periodically causes her to become significantly incapacitated, and interferes with her ability to do her job. This, in my view, constitutes a 'disability' within the meaning of the legislation.\n[69] For reasons that will be set out further on in this decision, I find it unnecessary to determine whether the other illnesses and injuries that Ms. Desormeaux has suffered over the years are transitory ailments or disabilities.\n(ii) Was Ms. Desormeaux's Disability a Factor in the Decision to Terminate her Employment? [70] Having found that Ms. Desormeaux was disabled, it remains to be determined whether her disability was a factor in OC Transpo's decision to terminate her employment.\n[71] OC Transpo contends that Ms. Desormeaux was not dismissed because of a disability. Based upon Ms. Desormeaux's track record, and the medical information available to it, OC Transpo says that it came to the conclusion that Ms. Desormeaux would not be able to attend work on a regular and reliable basis in the future. Moreover, from Dr. Meehan's report, OC Transpo was satisfied that Ms. Desormeaux's continued absences from work were not due to a disability.\n[72] I do not accept OC Transpo's submissions in this regard. It is clear that the decision to terminate Ms. Desormeaux's employment was predicated upon the employer's assessment of Ms. Desormeaux's future prospects for regular attendance, based, in part, on her past attendance record. Regardless of whether one considers the absences caused by her other ailments to be disability-related, a significant portion of Ms. Desormeaux's absences were headache-related. As I have previously noted, it is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the only reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. Taking disability-related absences into account in deciding to terminate an individual's employment for excessive absenteeism is prima facie discriminatory. (21)\n[73] It must also be recalled that the culminating incidents giving rise to Ms. Desormeaux's dismissal were the absences between November of 1997 and January 30, 1998. It is uncontradicted that all of these absences (other than the two mornings that she was late for work as a result of having slept in) resulted from Ms. Desormeaux being ill with headaches.\n[74] In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the Commission and Ms. Desormeaux have established a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability.\nD. Has OC Transpo Discharged its Burden? [75] Having found a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability, the onus is on OC Transpo to establish that attending work on a regular and reliable basis is a bona fide occupational requirement for a bus operator. There are three elements which must be established in order to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide occupational requirement. Each of these elements will be considered in turn.\n(i) Rational Connection [76] OC Transpo must first establish that it adopted its standard of regular and reliable attendance for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the performance of the job. The focus at this stage is not on the validity of the standard in issue, but rather on the validity of its more general purpose. (22)\n[77] There is no dispute in this case that the requirement that bus operators attend work on a regular and reliable basis is rationally connected to the delivery of timely public transit.\n(ii) Good Faith [78] The second element that must be established by OC Transpo is that it adopted its standard of regular and reliable attendance in good faith, in the belief that it is necessary for the delivery of timely public transit.\n[79] In his final submissions, counsel for the Commission stated that the Commission was not suggesting that OC Transpo acted other than in good faith. Nevertheless, throughout the hearing, the Commission challenged the actions of OC Transpo in utilizing a standard of 'regular and reliable attendance', and not providing Ms. Desormeaux with a specified number of days for which she could be absent from work. The only time that this was done was in 1990, when Ms. Desormeaux was told that she could not be away from work on more than five occasions, or for more than 12 days over 12 months. According to the Commission, fairness required that employees be provided with a numerical target for their attendance. The plant average for absenteeism was suggested as one possible defined standard.\n[80] Ron Marcotte explained that there is no permissible maximum number of days that OC Transpo employees can be away from work. Employees are expected to attend work as required, although OC Transpo recognizes that individuals will be unable to report to work from time to time for health-related reasons. OC Transpo's concern with providing employees with a specific number of days that they can miss is that this will create an expectation in the workforce that everyone can miss that many days, without consequence. Instead, the standard of 'regular and reliable attendance' provides flexibility, allowing the employer to tailor its response to the particular circumstances of each individual's situation. By way of example, Mr. Marcotte testified that there were employees whose attendance records may have been worse than Ms. Desormeaux's was in 1997-8, but who were at an earlier stage in the attendance management program. The employment of these individuals would not have been terminated, as they would have been provided with further opportunities to achieve regular and reliable attendance.\n[81] In closing argument, counsel for OC Transpo submitted that the facts of this case graphically illustrate the problems that can arise when an employee is given a fixed maximum number of days that they can be off of work. Ms. Desormeaux herself testified that on the one occasion that she was provided with a numerical target, she drove a bus with Tylenol 3 in her system, in order to meet the target set for her.\n[82] I do not accept the submissions of the Commission as to the need for a fixed number of days of permissible absence. The Supreme Court of Canada has indicated that employment standards must not be arbitrary, and should provide for individual accommodation.(23) Imposing the arbitrary requirement that a disabled employee's absenteeism not exceed a plant average, a condition not imposed on other employees, would clearly be discriminatory.(24) As a result, I find that OC Transpo has satisfied the good faith component of the Meiorin test.\n(iii) Did OC Transpo Accommodate Ms. Desormeaux to the Point of Undue Hardship? [83] The final issue to be determined is whether OC Transpo has established that its standard of regular and reliable attendance is reasonably necessary for delivery of timely public transit. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it would have been impossible to accommodate Ms. Desormeaux without imposing undue hardship on her employer.\n[84] The starting point for my analysis must be an assessment of Ms. Desormeaux's health status at the time that OC Transpo made the decision to terminate her employment. Ms. Desormeaux suffered from a litany of health problems over the years, and also suffered also a number of injuries. There is nothing in the evidence before me, however, to suggest that there is a relationship between the various conditions giving rise to her high level of absenteeism, or a single root cause for her inability to attend work on a regular basis. Rather, it appears that Ms. Desormeaux has simply been very unlucky over the years, having experienced a number of different, unrelated illnesses and injuries. Most of these conditions appear to have been self-limiting, and the evidence indicates that by the Fall of 1997, the only condition that was likely to cause long term problems for Ms. Desormeaux was her migraine headaches. In other words, there is nothing in the medical evidence before me to suggest that Ms. Desormeaux was any more likely to suffer from health problems (apart from those related to her headache condition) than was any other OC Transpo employee.\n[85] Lois Emberg testified that Dr. Meehan's comment that Ms. Desormeaux's migraines were potentially of a longer-term nature should have triggered a concern that Ms. Desormeaux may have been suffering from a disability. In such a case, Ms. Emberg says, no decision should have been made to terminate Ms. Desormeaux's employment until such time as the disability issue had been properly explored. Instead, what happened was that OC Transpo gave Ms. Desormeaux three more months to establish a pattern of regular and reliable attendance. When she could not do so because of her headaches, her employment was terminated.\n[86] In considering whether accommodation would have been possible, I must examine the implications that Ms. Desormeaux's migraine condition would likely have had for her ability to attend work on a regular and reliable basis after January of 1998. One way of predicting future absenteeism would be to look at Ms. Desormeaux's past history. As of January of 1998, Ms. Desormeaux had been employed by OC Transpo for approximately 8.75 years. In that time, she had missed 57 full days and 11 part days due to headaches. This translates to an average of 6.5 full days and 1.25 part days each year that Ms. Desormeaux was unable to attend work because of her migraine condition. Some minor upward adjustment to this number may be necessary to take into account the fact that Ms. Desormeaux did miss periods of time for other reasons, for example as a result of her back injury, when she was off of work for 79 days. During these absences, Ms. Desormeaux may well have suffered migraines, and been otherwise unable to work. Similarly, it is possible that a further upward adjustment might have to be made, in order to take into account the effect that Ms. Desormeaux's unrecorded absences would have on her rate of absenteeism. It is not clear, however, from the evidence if any of these unrecorded absences were migraine-related.\n[87] On the other hand, there is some suggestion that Ms. Desormeaux's past attendance history, insofar as her migraine-related absences are concerned, might not be an accurate predictor for her future attendance, and that some improvement in this regard could reasonably have been anticipated. The uncontradicted medical evidence before OC Transpo at the time that the decision was made to terminate Ms. Desormeaux's employment was that progress had been made in identifying one of the causes of her headaches. Dr. Meehan's October, 1997 report advised OC Transpo that steps were being taken to address the problem of Ms. Desormeaux's mechanical neck dysfunction, and that a definite improvement in her condition had been noted. While Ms. Desormeaux had repeatedly assured Mr. Marcotte that her migraines were being brought under control, here, for the first time, OC Transpo had medical evidence to suggest that an improvement in Ms. Desormeaux's ability to attend work on a regular basis could be anticipated.\n[88] However, between the November 6, 1997 meeting and the termination of her employment on January 30, 1998, Ms. Desormeaux was absent from work on four separate occasions, for a total of seven days, because of migraine headaches. In addition, she was late for work on two occasions, having slept in. With respect to these latter two absences, suffice it to say that it does not reflect well on Ms. Desormeaux's work ethic that she would sleep in, and twice be late for work, during a period where her job was clearly on the line.\n[89] Insofar as the migraine-related absences are concerned, the frequency of Ms. Desormeaux's absences during the three-month period leading up to the termination of her employment could reasonably have caused OC Transpo to question the accuracy of Dr. Meehan's prognosis. Although Mr. Marcotte was made aware of the reason for Ms. Desormeaux's absences in this time frame, no effort was made to obtain clarification of Dr. Meehan's findings. No attempt was made to ask Dr. Meehan whether there was a specific reason why Ms. Desormeaux was experiencing so many migraine-related absences during this period, and whether these absences changed Dr. Meehan's opinion as to Ms. Desormeaux's prognosis for future attendance. Similarly, no attempt was made to obtain an independent medical assessment of Ms. Desormeaux's condition, notwithstanding that such an assessment was expressly contemplated by OC Transpo's attendance management program.\n[90] Thus, by January of 1998, there was some uncertainty surrounding Ms. Desormeaux's prognosis. In all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the most reliable predictor for Ms. Desormeaux's future attendance was her long-term attendance history with OC Transpo.\n[91] The next issue to consider is whether OC Transpo could have accommodated an employee with Ms. Desormeaux's rate of migraine-related absenteeism. OC Transpo's contention that it could not accommodate Ms. Desormeaux's continued sporadic absences from work is founded primarily on operational considerations. In this regard, I note that the termination of Ms. Desormeaux's employment occurred prior to the Bill S-5 amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 15 (2) of the amended Act states that the factors that can be considered in relation to the issue of accommodation are health, safety and cost. (25) As a consequence, my consideration of the accommodation issue in this case is governed by the principles articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Alberta (Human Rights Commission) v. Central Alberta Dairy Pool (26), and subsequent cases.\n[92] In Dairy Pool, the Supreme Court provided a non-exhaustive list of the types of factors that could create an undue hardship, including operational considerations such as the size of the employer's operation and the interchangeability of the workforce. Logistical difficulties in replacing absent workers have recently been found by the Ontario Divisional Court to constitute an undue hardship. (27)\n[93] Mr. Marcotte explained that bus companies run on predetermined schedules. Customers rely upon buses arriving and departing on time, in order to conduct their business and make their connections. If too many operators fail to report to work on any given day, there may not be enough drivers to get all of the buses on the road. This causes interruptions in service, and problems for the citizens of the National Capital Region, who rely on OC Transpo for transportation. Unlike long-term absences, which OC Transpo can anticipate and provide for, intermittent, last minute absences are particularly challenging to address.\n[94] OC Transpo bus operators bid on routes and schedules in seventeen-week blocks, in accordance with the order of seniority. In each booking period, a certain number of drivers will be assigned to a spare board. The spare board is a pool of 75-100 bus operators who do not have a specific route assigned to them. Rather, the responsibility of the operators on the spare board is to fill in for absent operators, on an as-needed basis.\n[95] From time to time, there are not enough drivers on the spare board to fill in for all of the operators who are absent from work. In such circumstances, overtime will be offered to operators driving regularly scheduled routes. If there are not enough operators willing to work overtime to pick up the slack, buses may simply not go out, creating gaps in service.\n[96] Through Mr. Marcotte, OC Transpo introduced a record from January of 2001 regarding service coverage for the week of January 21 to 27. This document indicates that in the course of this week, 626 trips out of a weekly total of 37,445 did not go out on time. There were a number of reasons why these trips were cancelled. Some did not take place because of mechanical problems with the buses, depot delays or accidents. In 106 cases, buses did not leave the depot for reasons that could include the unavailability of operators.\n[97] Of the 626 cancelled trips, it appears in 395 cases, the buses ultimately did get out. Mr. Marcotte explained that these trips were filled with extras. It is unclear whether he meant employees from the spare board or other employees. This meant that 231 trips out of 37,445 never took place. The utility of these statistics is, however, diminished somewhat as it is not clear how many, if any, of these 231 trips were cancelled as a result of insufficient staff availability, rather than mechanical problems or other reasons.\n[98] Paul MacDonnell, the former President of the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 279, suggested that the January, 2001 sample may not reflect typical cancellation rates. According to Mr. MacDonnell, being mid-winter, January is the worst time of year for cancelled trips, because of the high incidence of mechanical problems for the buses. Mr. Marcotte did not address Mr. MacDonnell's comment with respect to the increased level of mechanical problems in the winter months, but suggested that inclement winter weather did not create significant problems with respect to service delivery as Ottawa has great street cleaners. Mr. Marcotte did concede that problems could arise if there was a big snowstorm. He was unable to state whether there was a storm during the week of January 21 to 27, 2001.\n[99] Mr. Marcotte could not provide comparable information regarding service coverage for the period surrounding the termination of Ms. Desormeaux's employment, although he did say that it was not uncommon for the spare board to be exhausted by employee absences. In such a situation, resort would have to be had to overtime, in order to have the buses run on time. According to Mr. Marcotte, there were even days where we couldn't provide overtime, which presumably meant days when trips had to be cancelled. He did not, however, give any indication of the frequency with which this occurred.\n[100] OC Transpo is a large employer. Mr. MacDonnell testified that there were anywhere from 1200 to 1500 bus operators working at OC Transpo at any one time. The annual budget for the organization was $150 million. When he was asked why OC Transpo did not simply hire more bus operators, in order to guarantee service coverage, Mr. MacDonnell indicated that OC Transpo had gone through hiring freezes and downsizing. He also stated that it was cheaper for OC Transpo to rely on overtime than to hire more operators.\n[101] Against this backdrop, I must then determine whether retaining an employee in Ms. Desormeaux's position would create an undue hardship for OC Transpo, as a result of her intermittent absenteeism. In examining this question, reference should be had to the testimony of Ron Marcotte in relation to OC Transpo's attendance management program. According to Mr. Marcotte, in 1995-6, employees coming under the attendance management program were those with an absenteeism rate of 18 days or more each year. By 1997-8, the rate had dropped somewhat. Mr. Marcotte suggested that the threshold for inclusion in the plan might have been 13 days per year, although he did not seem at all sure of this. I have found that a realistic prognosis for Ms. Desormeaux's future migraine-related absences was somewhere in the area of 6.5 full days and 1.25 part days each year - well below the absenteeism rate for 25% of OC Transpo bus operators. Even allowing for a few additional days of absence each year due to transient illnesses such as colds and the flu, I cannot conclude that as of January, 1998, Ms. Desormeaux's future absenteeism rate was likely to be at a level beyond that of a significant portion of OC Transpo's workforce.(28)\n[102] I accept that intermittent absenteeism could potentially create an undue hardship for an employer where, for example, a small workplace was involved, and the individual in question provided unique services to her employer. In this case however, OC Transpo employs a large workforce, and bus operator duties are largely inter-changeable. OC Transpo recognizes that on any given day a certain number of its bus operators will be unable to attend work. Because of the time-sensitive nature of the service that it delivers, OC Transpo makes provision for these absences through the use of the spare board system, a system that appears to generally work quite well. On the evidence before me, I am not persuaded that Ms. Desormeaux would cause an excessive drain on the spare board system in the future. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that OC Transpo has established that it would have suffered undue hardship if it had continued to employ Ms. Desormeaux.\n[103] Further, the evidence suggests that it may be possible to reduce Ms. Desormeaux's level of absenteeism somewhat, through the provision of modified duties. From Ms. Desormeaux's testimony, it appears that she is totally disabled in the early phases of a migraine attack, but that as the headache resolves, she is able to function to a certain extent. While she is unable to drive a bus safely, because of the medication in her system, she is able to perform other useful work for OC Transpo. According to Mr. MacDonnell, non-driving jobs are available to bus operators requiring accommodation.\n[104] Similarly, Mr. MacDonnell testified that there are ways in which OC Transpo could lessen the impact that Ms. Desormeaux's intermittent absences would have on service delivery. By way of example, he suggested that Ms. Desormeaux could be assigned to work on the spare board. Drivers assigned to the spare board are not always called upon to drive, and thus an absent spare board driver is less likely to cause a disruption in bus service.\n[105] None of these alternatives were explored, prior to the termination of Ms. Desormeaux's employment, as Mr. Marcotte clearly viewed the responsibility for improving the situation as resting solely on Ms. Desormeaux's shoulders.\n[106] Before leaving the question of accommodation, there are several other issues that bear comment. Although there was testimony as to the cost of providing sick leave benefits, there was insufficient evidence before me regarding the financial condition of OC Transpo for me to conclude that requiring OC Transpo to continue to provide such benefits to Ms. Desormeaux would constitute an undue hardship. (29)\n[107] OC Transpo led evidence through Lois Emberg, and the filing of its annual employment equity reports, as to the significant number of disabled individuals employed by OC Transpo. While I have considered this evidence, I have found it to be of limited assistance in assessing what happened in the case of Francine Desormeaux. Similarly, there was testimony regarding the Disabled Employees' Review Committee, a joint labour\/management committee set up to review accommodative measures for OC Transpo employees. This evidence must be viewed in light of Ms. Emberg's testimony that the Committee only became involved when an employee was going to require accommodation for more than four weeks at a time. As a consequence, Ms. Emberg says, the Committee would not be involved in a case such as that of Ms. Desormeaux, where the issue was intermittent, short-term absences.\n[108] OC Transpo contends that Ms. Desormeaux never said what she needed by way of accommodation, nor did she provide medical documentation to support such a request. Rather, Ms. Desormeaux repeatedly assured Mr. Marcotte that she would meet the standard of regular and reliable attendance in the future. As a consequence, OC Transpo says, Ms. Desormeaux did not satisfy the obligation on her to facilitate the search for accommodation.\n[109] It is common ground that Ms. Desormeaux was always very candid with her employer regarding her health problems. It is also true that over the years, she would try to assure her employer that she would do better in the future. However, as the termination of her employment approached, the question of accommodation did surface. I have found that during the November 6, 1997 meeting, Mr. Vye questioned whether Ms. Desormeaux's migraines constituted a disability, and suggested that they look at ways in which Ms. Desormeaux could be accommodated. I have accepted Ms. Desormeaux's testimony that Mr. Marcotte was not hearing what Mr. Vye was saying, and that no substantive discussion regarding accommodation took place. Mr. Vye again raised the issue of accommodation during the January 30, 1998 termination meeting. It is clear that despite being in possession of a medical report indicating that Ms. Desormeaux suffered from a health condition with possible long-term ramifications, which condition was continuing to cause Ms. Desormeaux to miss work, Mr. Marcotte was unwilling to explore what could be done in order to accommodate Ms. Desormeaux's needs.\n[110] The law regarding the duties of employer and employee in relation to accommodation is clear: it is the responsibility of the disabled employee to bring the facts relating to the discrimination to her employer's attention. Through the efforts of Mr. Vye, Ms. Desormeaux did this. It is not up to the employee to originate a solution - that is the responsibility of the employer.(30) In these circumstances, I am satisfied that Ms. Desormeaux fulfilled her duty to facilitate the search for accommodation.\n[111] The final issue for me to consider is the question of the liability of the Amalgamated Transit Union. In this regard, counsel for OC Transpo argues that if it is found to have discriminated against Ms. Desormeaux, the Union breached its duty to accommodate by failing to apprise the employer from the inception of the Attendance Management Program that Ms. Desormeaux's migraines required excessive days off.\n[112] It should be noted that the Union is not a party to Ms. Desormeaux's complaint. A motion was brought by OC Transpo at the commencement of the hearing to add the Union as a respondent. For reasons given at the time, this motion was dismissed. It is not clear from counsel's submissions whether she is now seeking to have an order made against the Union. Having dismissed the request to add the Union as a respondent, even if I were disposed to do so, I do not see how I could make an order against the non-party Union.\n[113] In any event, on the basis of the evidence before me, I do not see a basis for liability on the Union on either of the theories for union liability set out in the Renaud case. The fact that the Union may have been consulted with respect to OC Transpo's attendance management policy does not make the policy a joint union\/management policy. Further, the problem that I have identified in this case originates not in OC Transpo's policy, but in the way Ms. Desormeaux's case was handled by her employer. Similarly, there is nothing before me to suggest that at any time prior to January 30, 1998, the Union did anything to impede efforts to accommodate Ms. Desormeaux.\n[114] For the above reasons, Ms. Desormeaux's complaint is sustained.\nIV. REMEDY A. Reinstatement [115] Where a complaint of discrimination is found to be substantiated, it is the duty of a human rights tribunal to attempt to restore the complainant to the position that she would have been in, but for the discrimination. In this case, that duty is best discharged by reinstating Ms. Desormeaux to her position as a bus operator with OC Transpo. Ms. Desormeaux should receive the seniority and benefits, including pension benefits, that she would have had, had she been continuously employed by OC Transpo. She should, as well, receive any training necessary to update her skills and re-familiarize her with workplace policies and procedures.\n[116] In reinstating Ms. Desormeaux to the position of bus operator, I leave it to OC Transpo, in consultation with Ms. Desormeaux and her union, to identify a position for Ms. Desormeaux which will minimize the impact that Ms. Desormeaux's intermittent absences will have on service delivery. I further direct OC Transpo to consult with Ms. Desormeaux and her union, as well as with Dr. Meehan, if necessary, in order to determine what steps can safely be taken in order to minimize Ms. Desormeaux's absences from work, without her having to resort to driving while under the influence of medication. In this regard, I note that the Amalgamated Transit Union has undertaken to fully co-operate in the implementation of any order that the Tribunal may make against OC Transpo with respect to Ms. Desormeaux's return to the workplace.\n[117] Finally, Ms. Desormeaux has asked that she not be required to explain or justify each absence from work. With respect, I do not think that Ms. Desormeaux can expect to be able to miss work with impunity. Her employer is entitled to satisfy itself that there is a legitimate explanation for her absences. Ms. Desormeaux should have the same obligations with respect to the provision of medical certificates and other information regarding her absences as do other OC Transpo bus operators.\nB. Wage Loss [118] Consistent with the principle that human rights tribunals should attempt, insofar as may be possible, to make whole victims of discriminatory practices, Ms. Desormeaux should receive the wages that she has lost as a consequence of the termination of her employment with OC Transpo. OC Transpo says that any such award made to Ms. Desormeaux should be reduced, as she failed to take appropriate steps to mitigate her losses.\n[119] Following the termination of her employment, Ms. Desormeaux immediately began looking for work, and quickly found part-time employment as a child-care worker and school bus driver. She also drove a school taxi. Ms. Desormeaux was interviewed for a position with a tour bus company, but was not offered a position after explaining the circumstances of her departure from OC Transpo. After numerous other unsuccessful applications, the Employment Insurance office referred Ms. Desormeaux to a consultant in order to assist her in the preparation of a more professional resum\u00e9. Ms. Desormeaux also explored the possibility of establishing her own business - a taxi service to drive children to appointments. She did not pursue this venture, however, when she realized that the General Manager of OC Transpo was involved in the licencing process.\n[120] In February of 1999, Ms. Desormeaux decided to enroll at Mican Business College. She explained that by this point, she had been unsuccessful at arbitration, and had been unable to earn a salary comparable to that she had received while working at OC Transpo, without upgrading her skills. She took computer courses at Mican, to assist her in obtaining an administrative assistant position. She continued to drive a school taxi part-time.\n[121] After completing the program at Mican in July of 1999, Ms. Desormeaux registered with an office temp agency before obtaining a full-time position with the Gloucester Public Library. She worked there until January of 2000, when she began working as an examiner for the Ontario Ministry of Transport. Ms. Desormeaux was working at the Ministry of Transport at the time of the hearing.\n[122] OC Transpo points to the numerous driving jobs advertised during the period following the termination of Ms. Desormeaux's employment, submitting that Ms. Desormeaux made a personal decision to go back to school instead of applying for work. As a consequence, OC Transpo says, it should not be responsible for any wages Ms. Desormeaux may have lost between January and July of 1999. I do not agree.\n[123] At the time that Ms. Desormeaux was fired by OC Transpo, she had been working there for nearly nine years. Her entire career in commercial driving had been with OC Transpo, when she suddenly found herself unemployed, without a positive reference to assist her in finding new employment. Ms. Desormeaux diligently sought work. After being unsuccessful in finding full-time work for a year after the termination of her employment, her decision to upgrade her skills strikes me as entirely reasonable in the circumstances. As a result, I am satisfied that Ms. Desormeaux took reasonable steps to mitigate her losses, and that no adjustment should be made to the award for lost wages in this regard.\n[124] Ms. Desormeaux should thus be fully compensated for the wages that she lost between January 30, 1998, and the date of reinstatement. The parties are in agreement as to the wages that Ms. Desormeaux would have earned, had she continued working at OC Transpo. From this should be deducted the income that she earned from alternate sources. Ms. Desormeaux is responsible for ensuring that the Employment Insurance authority is reimbursed for any benefits that she received during this period, in accordance with the provisions of the Employment Insurance legislation.\n[125] In the event that the parties are unable to come to an agreement with respect to the monies owing to Ms. Desormeaux under the terms of this decision, I may be spoken to.\nC. Gross-up [126] Ms. Desormeaux will now be entitled to a lump sum payment on account of lost wages. This may well result in negative income tax consequences for her. In my view, it would unfairly penalize Ms. Desormeaux if she were to suffer a more onerous income tax burden, by receiving a lump sum payment now, than she would have incurred had the monies been paid to her as salary on an on-going basis between January of 1998 and the date of payment. This would be inconsistent with the remedial goal of making Ms. Desormeaux whole. Accordingly, OC Transpo shall pay Ms. Desormeaux an additional amount sufficient to cover any additional income tax liability that she may incur as a consequence of receiving payment in this fashion.\n[127] The Commission has also asked for an order requiring OC Transpo to pay for any actuarial costs associated with calculating the interest and gross-up in this case. I am not persuaded that either of these items should be particularly complicated, so as to require the services of an actuary. If the parties are unable to agree as to the appropriate figures in this regard, further submissions may be made to the Tribunal.\nD. Special Compensation [128] Section 53 (3) of the Act, as it stood in January of 1998, provided for awards of Special Compensation for reckless or wilful conduct, as well as for injuries to feelings or self-respect, to a maximum of $5,000. There will be a range of cases warranting awards of special compensation under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and the $5,000 maximum award must be reserved for the very worst cases.(31)\n[129] OC Transpo submits that it did not act recklessly or wilfully in terminating Ms. Desormeaux's employment, and that its staff was 'on a learning curve' in relation to its obligations to its disabled employees. Be that as it may, it is clear that Ms. Desormeaux was very shaken by the loss of her employment. The stress that she suffered as a result of being dismissed was compounded by the financial pressures that she suffered. As a single person, Ms. Desormeaux was very concerned about her ability to meet her obligations, in the absence of any income, and was forced to deplete her savings in order to live. She still becomes emotional when discussing the impact that the events surrounding the termination of her employment have had on her.\n[130] In all of the circumstances, I award Ms. Desormeaux $4,000 as special compensation.\nE. Interest [131] Interest is payable on awards of special compensation as well as on lost wages. (32) I order that interest be paid on the monies awarded pursuant to this decision, in accordance with Rule 9 (12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure. Interest on the award for lost wages should start to run from January 30, 1998, and be calculated as the wages would have become payable to Ms. Desormeaux. Interest on the special compensation shall run from January 30, 1998. In no case, however, should the total amount payable on account of special compensation, including interest, exceed $5,000. (33)\nF. Apology [132] Ms. Desormeaux seeks an apology for the treatment that she encountered in the course of her employment. She initially requested that the apology come from Mr. Marcotte, but later indicated that she wanted the apology from OC Transpo.\n[133] OC Transpo contends that I should decline to make the order requested, as it had not received proper notice of the request, in accordance with the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure. Having reviewed the Commission's disclosure, it is clear that OC Transpo was made aware that an apology was being sought, although the Commission did not specify who would be asked to provide the apology. There is no indication that OC Transpo would have done anything different in the presentation of its case, had it had specific notice that the apology was being sought from the organization, or that it was prejudiced in any way. As a consequence, I am satisfied that the apology should not be denied on the basis that there was insufficient notice that the remedy was being requested.\n[134] More importantly, OC Transpo also contends that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to make such an order, as forcing it to express views that it does not hold would violate OC Transpo's freedom of expression, contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[135] Since receiving the parties' written submissions on this question, it has come to my attention that the constitutional issue is currently before the Federal Court in Stevenson v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service. (34) Any decision that I make in this regard will therefore likely be superseded by the Court's decision. As a result, I propose to defer my decision regarding the apology issue until such time as the parties may have the benefit of the Court's decision in Stevenson, and the opportunity to make submissions regarding its effect.\n[136] If any party requires an immediate decision from the Tribunal, the Tribunal should be notified, and I will deal with the issue.\nG. Lost Wages for Attendance at the Hearing [137] The Commission and Ms. Desormeaux ask that she be compensated for the wages that she has lost by reason of her attendance at the hearing. Given that I have already awarded Ms. Desormeaux her lost wages to the date of reinstatement, I am not prepared to make the order requested, as it would result in Ms. Desormeaux recovering twice for the period in question.\nH. Consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission [138] The Commission asks that OC Transpo be ordered to consult with the Commission with respect to its accommodation policy. There are several reasons why I do not think that such a remedy is appropriate, in the circumstances of this case.\n[139] First, the problem that I have identified in the treatment of Ms. Desormeaux's disability stems not from the wording of OC Transpo's policy so much as from the failure to apply the policy in Ms. Desormeaux's case. Further, the passage of time between the termination of Ms. Desormeaux's employment and the hearing also means that events have largely overtaken things - not only is the attendance management policy that was in effect in January of 1998 no longer in place at OC Transpo - OC Transpo itself no longer exists, having become part of the City of Ottawa, with municipal amalgamation. (35) Accordingly, I decline to order consultation.\nI. Retention of Jurisdiction [140] I will retain jurisdiction in the event that the parties are unable to agree with respect to the quantification or implementation of any of the remedies awarded under this decision.\nV. ORDER [141] For the foregoing reasons, I declare that Ms. Desormeaux's rights under the Canadian Human Rights Act have been contravened by OC Transpo, and order that:\nMs. Desormeaux be reinstated in her position as a bus operator at the first reasonable opportunity, in accordance with the provisions of this decision; Ms. Desormeaux shall be awarded compensation for lost wages, calculated in accordance with this decision; OC Transpo shall pay to Ms. Desormeaux an amount sufficient to cover any additional income tax liability that she may incur as a consequence of receiving the monies referred to above in this fashion; OC Transpo shall pay $4,000 to Ms. Desormeaux as special compensation; Interest shall be paid on the lost wages and special compensation awarded pursuant to this decision, in accordance with Rule 9 (12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure. Interest on the lost wages shall run from January 30, 1998, calculated as the wages would have become payable to Ms. Desormeaux. Interest on the special compensation shall run from January 30, 1998; and Subject to any of the parties requesting an immediate decision, the parties may make further submissions with respect to the apology issue after receipt of the decision of the Federal Court in Stevenson v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service.\nORIGINAL SIGNED BY\nAnne L.

Ross Boutilier is a geologist employed with the Department of Natural Resources Canada (DNRC). He works at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. He has been employed with the federal Government since May 1986.\n2. Her Majesty in right of Canada as represented by the Treasury Board is the employer of Mr. Boutilier. The DNRC is the employing department.\n3. Mr. Boutilier is a member of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC).\n4. In 1994, Mr. Boutilier was covered by the 1991 Physical Sciences Group collective agreement between PIPSC and the Treasury Board.\n5. Article 20.09(b)(iv) of the 1991 Physical Sciences Group collective agreement between the Treasury Board and PIPSC provides for up to five (5) days leave with pay for the purpose of getting married. A copy of article 20.09(b)(iv) of the collective agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.\n6. In June 1994, Mr. Boutilier made a verbal request of the DNRC for marriage leave for the period of July 11 to 15. Mr. Boutilier requested the marriage leave for the purposes of participating in a same-sex union celebration with his same-sex partner on July 9, 1994. Mr. Boutilier's request was approved by his immediate supervisor, Dr. Charlotte Keen, and initially by the head of his department, Mr. J. Verhoef, after consultation with the management team. At the time that the leave was initially approved, Mr. Boutilier disclosed that he required the leave for the purpose of participating in a same-sex commitment ceremony.\n7. On July 8, 1994, Mr. Boutilier submitted a written request for leave. In his request, Mr. Boutilier requested five (5) days of marriage leave under art. 20.09(b)(iv) of the applicable collective agreement. Alternatively, he requested leave under art. 20.13 of the agreement, which provided the Employer with discretion to grant leave with or without pay for purposes other than those specified in the agreement. In the event the request for leave under both art. 20.09(b)(iv) and 20.13 was denied, Mr. Boutilier requested vacation leave. A copy of the application for leave is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.\n8. On July 9, 1994, Mr. Boutilier participated in a commitment ceremony with his same-sex partner. The ceremony took place in Nova Scotia before Reverend Young of the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches. A certificate of Holy Union was issued by Reverend Young: see Exhibit 3 attached hereto.\n9. No licence or certificate of marriage was issued under the laws of Nova Scotia in respect of the ceremony, nor were banns read.\n10. Following the ceremony, Mr. Boutilier took leave from July 11 to 14, 1994.\n11. By memorandum dated August 4, 1994, J. Verhoef, Head of Regional Reconnaissance, denied both Mr. Boutilier's request for marriage leave under art. 20.09(b)(iv) and his request for leave under art. 20.13. A copy of the memorandum is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.\n12. On August 19, 1994, Mr. Boutilier grieved the denial of leave under both art. 20.09(b)(iv) and art. 20.13 of the collective agreement. The grievance was referred to adjudication in June 1997 and the adjudicator allowed the grievance. The respondent applied to the Federal Court of Canada for judicial review of the adjudicator's decision. The Federal Court allowed the judicial review application on jurisdictional grounds in November 1998 holding that the adjudicator did not have jurisdiction to deal with the grievance. The Court found that the grievor was required to file a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied in September 2000.\n13. While Mr. Boutilier's grievance was under consideration, the DNRC did not seek to recover the leave that Mr. Boutilier had taken from July 11 to July 14, 1994. The leave credits have not yet been recovered.\n14. On October 21, 2000, Mr. Boutilier filed a complaint against the DNRC under ss. 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in respect of the refusal of his request for marriage leave. On January 24, 2001, he filed a complaint under s. 10 of the Act against the Treasury Board in respect of the Board's interpretation of the marriage leave provision under the collective agreement.\n15. As a result of being denied marriage leave, Ross Boutilier was ultimately required to use five (5) days annual leave.\n16. Mr. Boutilier is presently covered by the 2002 Applied Sciences and Engineering Groups collective agreement between Treasury Board and PIPSC, which expired on September 30, 2002. Art. 17.13(b)(iv) of this agreement provides for marriage leave. A copy of the relevant article of this collective agreement is found at Exhibit 5.\nGaylene Gurr 17. Gaylene Gurr has been an employee of the Government of Canada since September 1997. She works in the Employment Insurance Division of Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC), in Brandon, Manitoba.\n18. Ms. Gurr is a member of the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC). Her Majesty in right of Canada as represented by the Treasury Board is the employer for Ms. Gurr and HRDC is the employing department.\n19. In 2000, Ms. Gurr was covered by the 2000 Program and Administrative Services Group collective agreement between Treasury Board and PSAC.\n20. Article 45.01 of the collective agreement provides for up to five (5) days of leave with pay for the purpose of getting married. A copy of article 45.01 is attached as Exhibit 6.\n21. On April 26, 2000 and May 1, 2000, Mr. Gurr requested annual leave of three (3) days and three (3) hours for the purpose of participating in a ceremony with her same-sex partner. Ms. Gurr and her partner refer to their ceremony as a marriage ceremony and not as a commitment ceremony.\n22. A co-worker advised Ms. Gurr of the provision for marriage leave under the collective agreement. On May 31, 2000, Ms. Gurr submitted a request to change her previously approved request for annual leave to marriage leave. She requested three (3) days and three (3) hours of marriage leave. A copy of her request for marriage leave is attached as Exhibit 7.\n23. On June 2, 2000, Ms. Gurr's request for marriage leave was denied. The reason given to Ms. Gurr was that marriage leave is granted to those who enter a legal marriage. Ms. Gurr was required to use vacation leave instead.\n24. On June 3, 2000, Ms. Gurr and her same-sex partner participated in a religious ceremony officiated by the Reverend Walter Gibbons, ordained by the United Churches Canada. Reverend Gibbons issued a marriage certificate: see Exhibit 8 attached hereto.\n25. No licence or certificate was issued under the laws of Manitoba in respect of the ceremony.\n26. Ms. Gurr subsequently grieved the refusal of marriage leave. In an e-mail, Arlene G. Janman indicated to Ms. Gurr that her request had been denied because marriage leave can only be granted for the marriage of individuals of the opposite sex. Same sex marriages are not granted a marriage license and therefore are not legal. Her grievance was denied at the final level of the departmental grievance procedure and was referred to the Public Service Staff Relations Board (PSSRB). The PSSRB is holding the grievance in abeyance pending the outcome of the Tribunal hearing.\n27. On January 8, 2002, Ms. Gurr filed a complaint against the respondent Treasury Board Secretariat under s. 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in respect of the Board's interpretation of the marriage leave provision of the collective agreement. The complaint was amended on May 23, 2002. Ms. Gurr also filed a complaint under s. 7 of the Act against her employing department HRDC.\n28. Ms. Gurr is currently covered by the 2001 Program and Administrative Services collective agreement between the Treasury Board and PSAC. Art. 45.01 of that agreement provides for marriage leave. A copy of the relevant article of this collective agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 9.\nLoree-Anne Huard 29. Loree-Ann Huard has been an employee of the federal Government since April 1989.\n30. Ms. Huard is a member of PSAC. Until November 1, 1999, Her Majesty in right of Canada as represented by the Treasury Board was the employer of Revenue Canada employees. Revenue Canada was the employing department. On November 1, 1999, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency became her employer.\n31. At the time she made her request for marriage leave, Ms. Huard was covered by the 1989 Master Agreement between Treasury Board and PSAC.\n32. Clause M 21.01 of the 1989 collective agreement provided employees up to five (5) days of marriage leave with pay for the purpose of getting married. A copy of article 21.01 of this collective agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.\n33. On May 18, 1994, Ms. Huard applied for marriage leave to participate in a same-sex marriage. This application was initially accepted by Mr. Frank Brock, the supervisor of Ms. Huard.\n34. On May 25, 1994, upon learning from a co-worker that Ms. Huard was seeking marriage leave for a same-sex commitment ceremony, Mr. Brock informed Ms. Huard that her marriage leave was denied.\n35. On June 25, 1994, Ms. Huard participated in a commitment ceremony with her same-sex partner.\n36. Ms. Huard used her annual leave time to participate in the ceremony.\n37. Ms. Huard grieved the denial of marriage leave, but was unsuccessful. Ms. Huard was advised by S.M. Black, Director Registered Plans, Headquarters, that in the absence of a particular definition of the term 'marriage' in the Master Agreement, I referred to the definition of 'marriage' found in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (Eighth Ed.) which defines the term 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and woman. I also referred to the Hewens adjudication decision which dealt with the same issue and I have concluded that your intended marriage does not fall within the definition of the word 'marriage'.\n38. Treasury Board is no longer the employer of Ms. Huard. Since November 1, 1999, she has been employed by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. That Agency reached its own collective agreement with the Public Service Alliance on June 21, 2000. Ms. Huard's employment is currently governed by that collective agreement.\n39. On October 16, 2001, Ms. Huard filed a complaint under s. 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in respect of the Board's policy on the interpretation of the marriage leave provision of the collective agreement. The complaint named the Treasury Board as respondent. She also filed a complaint under s. 7 of the Act against her employing organization.\nMarriage Leave under the Collective Agreements 40. Under the Public Service Staff Relations Act (PSSRA), the Treasury Board negotiates collective agreements on behalf of the Government of Canada. The Treasury Board is the Employer for those branches of the Public Service listed in Part I of Schedule I to the PSSRA: see s. 55 of the PSSRA.\n41. The Treasury Board does not negotiate collective agreements on behalf of the federal government organizations that are separate Employers. Separate Employers are set out in Part II of Schedule I to the PSSRA. Those Employers negotiate their collective agreements separately. Pursuant to s. 56 of the PSSRA, the collective agreements of separate Employers are subject to the approval of the Governor-in-Council.\n42. The Treasury Board is not the Employer for, and does not negotiate collective agreements with, employees working for the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. By virtue of s. 58 of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Act, the Agency negotiates its own collective agreements.\n43. Federal government employees are classified into different occupational groups. For collective bargaining purposes, bargaining units are established and certified for one or more of these occupational groups. Bargaining units are represented by bargaining agents at collective negotiations. There are currently 25 bargaining units, each with its own collective agreement with the Treasury Board.\n44. There are currently 17 unions which are registered as bargaining agents. A union can be the bargaining agent for more than one bargaining unit.\n45. Mr. Boutilier is a member of the Physical Sciences Group and his bargaining agent is the Professional Institute of Public Service Employees (PIPSC). Ms. Gurr is a member of the Clerical and Regulatory (CR) group and Ms. Huard of the Programme Administrative (PM) group. At the relevant times, the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) was the bargaining agent for these two groups.\n46. To initiate the collective bargaining process, the bargaining agent must serve a notice of intent to negotiate. This can be done up to three months prior to the expiration of a collective agreement. At that stage, the unions have a choice of choosing one of two negotiating routes: conciliation\/strike or binding arbitration. If there is an impasse in bargaining, this is resolved by the route chosen by the union. If arbitration has been selected by the bargaining agent, then disputes go to a panel of arbitrators who make a final determination. If the conciliation\/strike route is chosen, then disputes go before a conciliation board which attempts to resolve the dispute. If the dispute remains outstanding, then the union can opt to go on strike.\n47. There are certain issues that are not the subject of collective bargaining. They are set out in s. 57(1) of the PSSRA. In addition, any matters that are the subject of National Joint Council directives are not the subject of collective bargaining unless the bargaining unit has opted out of the directive. The Council consists of all the Public Service bargaining agents and the Treasury Board as Employer.\n48. Both the PIPSC and PSAC have given notice to begin collective bargaining in respect of the collective agreements at issue here.\n49. Marriage leave is currently available in all collective agreements for which Treasury Board is the Employer. There are, however, certain differences in the marriage leave clause from collective agreement to collective agreement. In some collective agreements, the marriage leave comes under the leave with pay for family related responsibilities clause: see, for example, the collective agreement applicable to Mr. Boutilier at Exhibit 5. Employees are eligible for up to 5 days for family related responsibilities of all sorts. In other collective agreements, up to 5 days of marriage leave is provided independently of other leave taken: see, for example, the collective agreement governing Ms. Huard at Exhibit 10. Another difference found in respect of marriage leave is that in some collective agreements, employees are entitled to receive up to 2 days of marriage leave only.\n50. Marriage leave has been in the Public Service collective agreements since the first collective agreements were entered into following the passage of the PSSRA in 1967. Prior to the introduction of collective bargaining, marriage leave was available as a form of special leave starting in the 1950's. The number of days available varied from time to time. Generally, up to five (5) days was available, though this could be reduced if other leave was taken. It was introduced at the time as the amount of annual leave available was generally limited.\n51. Marriage leave in the collective agreements has certain limitations. Generally, employees must have worked for one year of continuous employment and it is only for the purpose of getting of married. As a result of this latter requirement, it has to be taken at the time of marriage. It cannot be taken at a time after or before the marriage. Marriage leave has not been made available to common law couples.\n52. Treasury Board has consistently taken the position that marriage leave is for purpose of getting married and is not, therefore, available to employees either for purposes of entering into common law relationships or participating in commitment ceremonies.\n53. Although Treasury Board is the Employer for purposes of negotiating collective agreements, the day-to-day administration of agreements is left with government departments. Where there is a doubt as to interpretation of a clause in an agreement, the Treasury Board must be consulted as it establishes the Employer's policy with respect to the interpretation and application of clauses of collective agreements.\n54. In recent years, both the Treasury Board and some of the bargaining agents, including PSAC and PIPS, have sought to change the marriage clause in collective agreements. The Treasury Board has sought to eliminate marriage leave on the basis that it is no longer required given that employees now have more vacation leave credits than they had in the days when marriage leave was first introduced. Some of the unions have proposed to replace marriage leave with spousal union leave, which would be available for the purpose of declaring spousal union with another person in a public ceremony. As neither side has agreed to accept the other's proposal, the collective agreements clause has been signed with the marriage leave clause has remaining unchanged.\nDated at ., this day of , 2003.\nRoss Boutilier\n(Complainant)\nDated at ., this day of , 2003.\nLoree-Ann Huard\n(Complainant)\nDated at ., this day of , 2003.\nGaylene Gurr\n(Complainant)\nDated at ., this day of , 2003.\nCanadian Human Right Commission\nPer: Leslie Reaume\n(Commission)\nDated at ., this day of , 2003.\nTreasury Board,\nDepartment of Natural Resources,\nHuman Resources Development Canada\nPer: Brian J.

Sexual Harassment Training and Counselling\nG. Retention of Jurisdiction\n[1] The Complainant and the Respondent are employees of Canada Post Corporation (Canada Post). The Complainant alleges that the Respondent sexually harassed her during the period when they were both members of their union\u2019s local executive, from February to August 1998.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) was the only party represented by legal counsel at the hearing before the Tribunal. The Complainant\u2019s case was essentially introduced through the evidence led by the Commission. The Respondent presented his case on his own.\nI. Facts A. The Complainant\u2019s Perspective (i) Employment and Union Membership [3] The Complainant has worked at Canada Post since 1982. Her position in 1998 was that of Officer of Testing and Design, within the Service Performance Evaluation section. The section measures the delivery performance of Canada Post\u2019s products. She worked in an office situated in one of several large buildings that are occupied by Canada Post, near the intersection of Riverside Drive and Heron Road, in Ottawa. Her office was on the 3rd floor of the 10-storey structure known as the East Tower.\n[4] The Respondent was first hired by Canada Post in 1991. His regular position in 1998 was that of Supervisor in Transactional Control Accounting, in what is essentially the billing and accounting department of Canada Post. In April and May 1998, he received an acting assignment at the higher level position of Officer. His office was on the 5th floor of the East Tower, two storeys above the Complainant\u2019s office.\n[5] Both parties were members of the Union of Postal Communications Employees (UPCE), the bargaining agent for about 3,000 of Canada Post\u2019s employees. The UPCE is a component of the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC). The Complainant became involved in some of the UPCE\u2019s activities in 1994, and, in 1996, she was elected Vice-President of her local, UPCE 70180 (Local). It was the UPCE\u2019s largest local in the country, with about 1,000 members at that time.\n[6] Although the Complainant and the Respondent worked in the same building, their occupations were completely unrelated. They met for the first time in September 1997, during a union membership meeting. Several days after the meeting, the Respondent went to the Complainant\u2019s office and inquired about how he could get more involved with the union. She advised him to speak to the then President of the Local, Mr. Jim Fraser, or the Chief Shop Steward, Mr. Ken Zarichansky. She also suggested to the Respondent that he consider taking several courses offered by the PSAC.\n[7] The Complainant testified that from October 1997 until February 1998, the Respondent showed up at her Canada Post office about once every month. She was leery of his visits although there was nothing in his conduct that gave her specific cause for concern. She found it odd that he would keep coming back even though she had advised him to speak to the other members of the Local Executive about getting more involved.\n[8] On February 19, 1998, a general membership meeting was held to elect the Local\u2019s Executive. Mr. Fraser did not want to run for President again, preferring instead to devote himself entirely to his other duties as Full-time Officer of the Local (a full-time paid position). The members elected the Complainant to replace him as President. The position of Treasurer had also been vacated. By then, Mr. Fraser and other members of the previous Executive had already met the Respondent. They considered him to be a good candidate for Treasurer since he possessed accounting skills, worked in an accounting-related position at Canada Post and had taken college level courses in the Certified General Accounting program.\n[9] These Executive members recommended the Respondent\u2019s candidacy to the Complainant and they proposed that she, as the newly elected President, nominate him to improve his prospects for election. She testified that she initially objected to their proposal, in light of her general concerns about his visits to her office. She eventually went along with the others\u2019 suggestion and nominated the Respondent for Treasurer. He won the election for the position.\n[10] The Treasurer\u2019s duties consisted essentially of receiving and depositing the Local\u2019s monies and issuing cheques for disbursements, including those related to the Full-time Officer\u2019s salary. In addition, the Treasurer was involved in the preparation of the annual financial statements and budget. For the issuance of cheques, two signatures were required from either the Treasurer, President, Vice-President or Full-time Officer, although the latter was not permitted to sign his own pay cheque. No more than ten to twenty cheques were issued in a given month. Much of the Executive\u2019s activities related to grievances and disciplinary actions involving the Local\u2019s membership. These matters were dealt with mostly by the Full-time Officer in consultation with the President and the Chief Shop Steward. These tasks did not form part of the Treasurer\u2019s range of duties. The Treasurer was expected to attend executive meetings, which were held about once a month, in the evenings.\n[11] The Local had leased office space at a nearby building that was owned by the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC). The CLC building was within walking distance from the Canada Post complex where the Complainant and the Respondent worked. All of the Local\u2019s documents, including its financial records, were kept at the office. Access to the office was restricted, but all the Executive members, including the Respondent, were provided with keys and access cards that enabled them to enter at any time, on any day of the week. The Complainant testified that she kept no financial records or other union documents at her Canada Post office. She was not directly involved in the making of payments by the Local, aside from the requirement that she approve mileage claims and other extraordinary expenses. The Complainant claims that the Respondent was instructed, when he took on his duties, to leave these expense-related documents and any cheques that required her signature, in her mail slot at the Local office. After being signed, the cheques were to be mailed by the Full-time Officer who worked there each day. She herself ordinarily went to the Local office daily, mainly to verify if the employer had sent any twenty-four notices requesting a meeting, pursuant to the collective agreement.\n(ii) Visits and Calls by the Respondent to the Complainant\u2019s Office [12] The Complainant alleges that very soon after the Respondent was elected Treasurer, he began to contact her at work repeatedly, by telephone and in person. She recalls that he was calling her about four to five times per day and that he was coming down to her office just as often. Considering the limited scope of the Treasurer\u2019s duties and the minimal degree of interaction with other Executive members that was required, there was almost no reason at all for him to be in touch with her at work.\n[13] She states that the subject matter of these calls and visits initially concerned ways to improve the union\u2019s operations. However, the conversations soon began to drift towards personal matters. He began to tell the Complainant details about his family life. He is of East Indian origin and he explained how he had an arranged marriage in accordance with the customs of his culture. She claims that these conversations were distracting her from her work and became very annoying. She occasionally asked him to leave but he often just remained at her doorway and stared at her.\n[14] Another topic raised by the Respondent with the Complainant was his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. According to the Complainant, within five days after the Local\u2019s election, he began asking to sit down and review this document with her. She consented and they met for this purpose at the Local office one afternoon after work. The Complainant claims that she ended up being in the office with the Respondent for two hours. It became evident to her that he was unwilling to accept some of her recommendations just so the meeting could be prolonged and he could spend more time with her. He repeatedly requested additional help with his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 over the following weeks even though she told him she was too busy to help.\n(iii) Incident Outside of the Complainant\u2019s Apartment Building [15] On March 10, 1998, the Complainant alleges that an incident took place that changed the nature of the Respondent\u2019s conduct towards her from merely annoying to overtly sexual. Freezing rain was coming down that day and the roads were icy. She had walked over to the Local office on her way home from work, in order to check for any correspondence. The Respondent called the office and she answered. He told her he was going to come in to do some accounting work. He insisted that she not attempt to walk to her nearby apartment but that she wait for him to come by and drive her home. The Complainant initially refused but the Respondent was so insistent, that she finally accepted.\n[16] As they pulled up to the driveway of her apartment building, the Respondent asked her which of the units was hers and she pointed it out. He then turned to her and asked if he could come into her apartment. She said no, but he replied that it would be alright since he could easily call his wife and tell her he was working late. He suggested that the Complainant could give him a drink. She testified that she again told him no, that he was not coming into her apartment and that he should behave himself. She claims that he told her they could get intimate together. He went on to say, It\u2019s okay if we have sex and Won\u2019t you even give me a kiss? She again told him no, to which he responded that she would have no choice but to kiss him. If she refused to do so in private, he would force a situation upon her where she would have to kiss him in public. She stepped out of the car and slammed the door shut behind her.\n[17] She was angry and upset, but her greatest concern lay in the fact that she had indicated to him where her ground floor unit was located. In her testimony, the Complainant stated that although she had received lifts home from other Executive members and work colleagues in the past, people with whom she was acquainted for years, no one had ever entered or even requested to come into her apartment.\n(iv) The Subject Matter of the Respondent\u2019s Visits and Calls Becomes Sexual in Nature [18] According to the Complainant, the Respondent\u2019s uninvited calls and visits continued unabated over the following weeks. His first daily visit typically occurred at 7:30 a.m., as he was coming in to work, followed by another visit between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m., a third one at noon and a final visit in the late afternoon. He became more forward in his comments, telling the Complainant that it was important for him to see her each day. He would say that he liked a particular dress that she was wearing and ask that she wear it again so that his fantasies would come true. He said that he would continue to pursue her until those fantasies came true. He also told her that he would be jealous if she had a relationship with another man. He advised her to not tell anyone about their relationship and that if she did do so, he would deny it. He told her that it is a man\u2019s world, she had no proof and her word would never be believed. She repeatedly told him that they did not have a relationship and that his behaviour was unacceptable. Yet, he continued calling and visiting her.\n[19] The Complainant testified that the Respondent always made sure that his statements would not be overheard. During his early morning visits, there usually were no other people working nearby. The Complainant\u2019s section was divided up into several offices by partial-height partitions. The evidence is that the co-worker whose office was on one side of hers was legally deaf. In addition, Richard Hudon, whose office was on the other side, testified that he had several illnesses that caused him significant pain, during this period. In order to alleviate the pain, Mr. Hudon tried to focus his complete attention on one thing at a time, typically his work. He was, therefore, often able to block out any other activities going on around him.\n[20] Even so, Mr. Hudon testified that he witnessed the Respondent\u2019s frequent visits to the Complainant\u2019s office. To his recollection, there were usually three to four visits a day, each about seven minutes long. Mr. Hudon assumed initially that the parties\u2019 conversations were union-related, but after a while, he sensed that the subject-matter was more personal in nature, and he deliberately tried not to overhear.\n(v) The Response from Other Union Executives [21] The Complainant testified that the day after the March 10, 1998 incident in the Respondent\u2019s car, she called or spoke in person with the following union executives to complain about the Respondent\u2019s conduct:\nX Jim Fraser \u2013 Full-time Officer and former President of Local;\nX Dave Vaughan \u2013 Vice-President of Local;\nX Tom Matchett \u2013 Ontario Regional Director of the UPCE;\nX Jim Murray \u2013 National President of the UPCE.\nThey all told the Respondent that she was overreacting. According to the Complainant, they did not believe that a quiet, nice, little guy like the Respondent could have done what she alleged. She claims that Mr. Murray even told her, Isn\u2019t it funny that you\u2019ve got a boyfriend. He went on to tell her that it was a personal matter that she should resolve for herself, without involving the union.\n[22] As a result, she realized that she would get little support from these men and that she would have to deal with the Respondent on her own. In spite of that, she soon got into the habit of calling Mr. Fraser or Mr. Vaughan after the Respondent\u2019s uninvited visits. She concluded that if her union colleagues were not going to help her deal with the Respondent\u2019s harassment, she would make an effort to deflect some of the harassment on to them.\n[23] All four of these men testified in the present case. They confirm having been notified by the Complainant of her allegations and they all, to greater or lesser extents, acknowledge that they had not fully understood or grasped the issues being raised by the Complainant. Messrs. Vaughan and Fraser were particularly apologetic regarding their reactions to her complaints. They also both confirmed that over a period of time the Complainant called them several times a day to complain about the day\u2019s most recent unwanted visits by the Respondent.\n(vi) National UPCE Conference in London, Ontario [24] In March 1998, the UPCE held its national conference in London, Ontario. The delegates attending from the Local were the Complainant, Mr. Fraser, Mr. Vaughan and Ken Zarichansky, the Chief Shop Steward. The day before departing from Ottawa to go to the conference, the Complainant went to the Local office after work to check for any correspondence. The Respondent showed up at the office while she was there. According to the Complainant, he asked her if she would take him along to the conference, adding that they could stay in the hotel room and have sex. If he did not go with her, he said that he was going to call her at the hotel when she got there to make sure she was alright. She replied that he could not come along and that he was not to call her, at home or at the hotel. She then left.\n[25] When she got home, she received a call from the Respondent telling her that Mr. Zarichansky was at the Local office and wanted to speak to her about a grievance. She retorted that the Respondent had been specifically instructed to not call her at home, and that if Mr. Zarichansky wanted to speak to her, he could place the call himself.\n[26] In the Complainant\u2019s opinion, the Respondent had by this time become obsessed with seeing her. For instance, she believes that he was making very frequent visits to the Local office in the hope of running into the Complainant. If the Local received several invoices that required payment, the Respondent had the habit of going to the office repeatedly, over a series of days, and making out one cheque per visit, instead of doing them all at once. He thus created for himself ostensible cause for showing up at the office over several evenings.\n(vii) Purchase of New Couch for Office and Gifts for the Complainant [27] The Complainant alleges that, on numerous occasions, the Respondent proposed several questionable purchases by the Local, including that of a new couch for the office. The office already had a two seat couch that was in good condition and did not require replacement. According to the Complainant, the Respondent told her that he wanted a new and presumably larger couch to be bought, on which he could have sex with her and other women.\n[28] Mr. Fraser testified that the Respondent spoke to him about buying a new couch as well. The reason given by the Respondent was so that he could lay down. Mr. Fraser informed the Respondent that spending union funds on a new couch when there was one there already would be unacceptable to the membership. Mr. Fraser and other witnesses noted in their testimonies that both the CLC\u2019s Building and the Canada Post buildings had nursing stations with cots where employees could go if they felt the need to lie down.\n[29] The Complainant testified that beginning in the month of April 1998, the Respondent began suggesting that the Local should buy a dress and flowers for her on the occasion of her birthday, which was coming up in May. He also proposed that the union organize a birthday party for her. She told him many times that his suggestions were inappropriate.\n[30] Messrs. Hudon, Vaughan and Fraser recall having gone to lunch at a restaurant one day, with other members of the Local, including the Respondent and the Complainant. While they were all at the table, the Respondent mentioned that the Local should buy a dress and hold a party for the Complainant. According to Mr. Hudon, the comment was made in a serious tone and not in a joking fashion. He describes the comment as having been a conversation stopper. Mr. Fraser and the Complainant told the Respondent that his suggestion was inappropriate.\n[31] Mr. Fraser also testified that on several occasions, the Respondent had raised with him the idea of purchasing flowers and a dress for the Complainant. Mr. Fraser remembers wondering how the Respondent, who was married with a family, could suggest buying a gift as personal as flowers or a dress.\n[32] According to the Complainant, the Local did not ultimately ever throw a party nor purchase any gifts of this nature for her.\n(viii) Incident at Office of the Local - April 18, 1998 [33] In order to update its bookkeeping practices, the Local had purchased the computerized accounting software known as Quicken. This program was readily available at retail stores and was designed to be used by ordinary consumers to keep track of their personal banking and other transactions. The program had been installed on the Local\u2019s computer. As Treasurer, the Respondent was expected to use this software.\n[34] The evidence suggests that as of 1998, the Respondent was very competent in the use of various computer programs at Canada Post, which were, by all accounts, significantly more complex than Quicken. The Respondent\u2019s supervisor at that time, Franco Chiumera, testified that the Respondent was fairly knowledgeable at learning computer programs and that he demonstrated an ability to pick up programs more quickly than others. The Respondent\u2019s supervisor between 1999 and 2001 was Alex Eloise. He testified that the Respondent\u2019s computer skills were the best in his team and that the Respondent was the driving force behind computer usage in the section. Mr. Eloise also confirmed that the Respondent was a quick study in learning new software.\n[35] In early April 1998, the Respondent spoke to the Complainant and asked her to train him on Quicken after business hours, at the Local office. She declined, explaining to him that she had not really used the program yet herself. He nonetheless insisted that she train him. According to the Complainant, who has, since that time, had occasion to use Quicken, the software is so simple that she was able to learn how to use it by herself within ten minutes.\n[36] The Complainant spoke to a colleague from work, Mary Sue Allen, who was already acquainted with the software since she had been using it at home to manage her family\u2019s finances, and asked Ms. Allen to meet the Respondent and provide him with some training. When Ms. Allen first contacted the Respondent, she suggested that it may be more helpful for him to read the software\u2019s on-line manual or take a professional training course. According to Ms. Allen, he declined her suggestion and insisted on receiving the training from her. A meeting was therefore arranged between her and the Respondent for Saturday, April 18, 1998, at 1:00 p.m., at the Local office.\n[37] As the time of the meeting approached, the Complainant contends that she began to worry about Ms. Allen\u2019s safety, in light of the Respondent\u2019s prior comments about how he wanted to have sex on the couch in the Local office. The Complainant therefore decided to go to the office on that Saturday, to ensure that nothing untoward would happen to Ms. Allen. Unbeknownst to the Complainant, Ms. Allen had developed some concerns of her own. Ms. Allen stated in her testimony that she became uncomfortable with the Respondent\u2019s insistence that she train him. So, on the morning of April 18, she called and cancelled the meeting.\n[38] The Complainant, being unaware of the cancellation, arrived at the Local office at about 1:00 p.m., when the training was scheduled to begin. She found the Respondent sitting at the desk with an open beer bottle in front of him. Based on his speech, he appeared tipsy, though not drunk. He informed the Complainant that Ms. Allen had cancelled the training session. As the Complainant turned to leave, the Respondent said that he had uncovered a problem with respect to Mr. Fraser\u2019s expense claims. The Complainant, therefore, decided to speak by telephone to Mr. Fraser about this issue. She sat at the desk and the Respondent stood behind her as they spoke through the hands-free speakerphone. Mr. Fraser confirmed in his testimony that this conversation took place and that it lasted about ten to fifteen minutes.\n[39] After the call was completed, the Respondent asked the Complainant, who was still seated, to pull her chair in so that he could get to the bulletin board behind her. She gave him some space, but he pushed her chair further in, saying he needed even more room. As a result, she was now stuck against the desk, unable to move or get up. At this point, he grabbed her forearms with his hands and began kissing her hair, head and neck. She told him to get the fuck off her but he refused. He said that he was in love with her and she had to agree to have sex with him. She told him to get off her once more, and to get in front of the desk. He again said no, but after she threatened to call the police, he let go and moved to the other side of the desk. The Complainant told him that his behaviour was inappropriate and a violation of the PSAC harassment policy, for which he could be disciplined. He retorted that he was going to force her to kiss him. She replied that she would not kiss him and that she did not want to have sex with him.\n[40] At this stage, the Respondent confirmed to the Complainant that he had sought the Treasurer\u2019s position just so he could pursue her. He indicated that from where he came, there was no problem with his having a relationship with her. He also reiterated that if she told anyone about his behaviour, she would not be believed, and that it was a man\u2019s world where a woman\u2019s word made no difference. She repeated to him that he was in breach of the PSAC harassment policy and that his behaviour had to cease immediately. She then left the office. She testified that during this incident, she maintained a calm demeanour. She was upset all the same and when she got home to her apartment, she curled up in a ball and just cried. She considered calling the police but assumed it would be to no avail as it would just have been her word against his. The Complainant claims that the Respondent had held her arms so tightly that she developed bruises. Indeed, Mr. Hudon recalls having noticed at work that one of the Complainant\u2019s forearms was bruised, although he does not remember exactly when he made this observation.\n(ix) April 19, 1998 Letter from Complainant to Respondent [41] The Complainant decided that she had to take some formal action against the Respondent since her verbal warnings about his conduct had not worked. Thus, on Sunday, April 19, 1998, the day after the incident with the Respondent, she drafted a letter addressed to him. It was printed on the Local\u2019s stationery and stated the following:\nRegarding: Inappropriate Sexual Comments\nOn March 26, April 18, and several other occasions, you have made inappropriate sexual comments to me. These comments have ranged from telling me how beautiful I am to requesting that I do not date anyone else to asking me to have sex with you.\nOn at least four occasions, I have told you to refrain from making these comments. On April 18, 1998, I explained to you that this is a violation of the PSAC Constitution and the PSAC Harassment Policy. Enclosed is a copy of the PSAC Harassment Policy and a copy of the PSAC Constitution, Section 25, Discipline which outline the potential steps that could be taken if this behavior is not stopped.\nYour sexual comments are unwarranted and unwelcome. Due to the fact that I have on several occasions requested that you refrain from this behavior and you have not adjusted your behavior accordingly, I feel that you are sexually harassing me.\nIn the future, I expect that you will deal with me in a professional, business manner as it is inappropriate for you to continue make [sic] these sexual comments to me.\nSincerely\n[signed]\nConnie Bushey\nPresident, Local 70180\nThe letter indicates that copies were to be provided to Messrs. Vaughan, Fraser, Murray and Matchett.\n[42] The Complainant does not mention the alleged incident of physical contact in the letter. She explained in her testimony that the office of Local President was very public in nature and she wanted to keep her personal problems private. She also feared that an assertion by her that she had been assaulted could have been used against her by others, particularly because she felt that without any witnesses, no one would believe her. On Monday, April 20, 1998, the Complainant handed the letter to Messrs. Fraser and Vaughan and asked them to deliver it to the Respondent, who was away from work that day on annual leave.\n[43] Early the next morning, Tuesday, April 21, 1998, the Respondent telephoned the Complainant at her office and said that he wanted to talk to her about what happened Saturday. She replied that she did not want to talk to him and that he was to leave her alone and not contact her. A short time later, at the indicated time of 9:11 a.m., the Respondent sent her an e-mail message in which he stated:\nI am sorry, wouldn\u2019t you wish me best of luck for my exam. I still have respect for you.\nArvind.\n[44] The Respondent was to write an examination regarding a job competition later that day. The Complainant asserts that up to that date, no problem had arisen with respect to any of the Respondent\u2019s acts in his capacity as Treasurer and that the only possible matter for him to have apologized about was the incident of April 18th.\n[45] At 11:00 a.m., apparently after Messrs. Fraser and Vaughan had asked to meet with him, the Respondent called the Complainant to tell her that she had no right to tell them what had happened. He asserted that he was the one being harassed and informed the Complainant that she would never be believed. She replied that he had continued his inappropriate behaviour, despite her warnings against it. She had no choice but to bring the matter to a higher level.\n[46] Messrs. Fraser and Vaughan met with the Respondent over the lunch hour on April 21. They handed him the letter and told him that the attention that he had been showing to the Complainant was improper. They advised him to cease and desist this conduct and, in particular, to not have any further contact with her other than for union-related business. The Respondent denied having done anything wrong. He offered to resign as Treasurer but Messrs. Fraser and Vaughan replied that he had been doing a good job and his resignation was not necessary. As Mr. Vaughan recalls, the Respondent agreed to not bother the Complainant any more. It was suggested to the Respondent that an apology to the Complainant may be appropriate. He was specifically instructed to not telephone her that day.\n[47] A shop stewards\u2019 meeting was taking place at the Local office that evening, which the Complainant decided not to attend. Amongst the people present was the Respondent. At about 5:30 p.m., the Complainant received a call at her home from him. He told her that he was at the meeting, that extra pizza had been ordered and that she should come over to have some. She replied that he had been specifically instructed to not call her. He said that he wanted to apologize for his behaviour and that he had to hear her voice. She told him not to call her again and slammed down the phone.\n[48] On April 22, 1998, the Complainant received a letter from the Respondent that states the following (the text has not been altered or corrected):\nTo: Connie Bushey\nFrom: Arvind Sharma\nSubject: Inappropriate Behaviour\nConnnie, I am deeply sorry and I am apologising for all conflict it may have cause you. I will endevour to earn your respect again. I am and will be professional and be respectful. I trust that you will forgive me. I do not know what else I should say. Also I want to ask your opinion time to time; therefore, please guide me.\nRegards,\n[signed]\nArvind\nAt about 7:30 a.m., on the following day, April 23rd, the Respondent walked into the Complainant\u2019s office. She was busy talking on the phone so he left her a message on a small Post-It self-adhesive sheet of paper that he placed on her desk. The note stated (the text is again unaltered):\nPlse Phone me & say you have forgotten. Connie, I\u2019ll never hurt you.\nThx Arvind.\nThe Complainant threw the note in the garbage can and the Respondent left her office. She later retrieved the note and it was entered into evidence at the hearing.\n[49] Later that day, at about 3:00 p.m., the Complainant met with Messrs. Fraser and Vaughan at the Local office. They called and spoke to the Respondent over the hands-free speakerphone. Mr. Fraser and Mr. Vaughan chastised him for having phoned the Complainant and they reiterated that he was to stop contacting her for anything besides union business. He was also to return the Complainant\u2019s business card that contained her unlisted home telephone number, which he had been given when he became Treasurer. The Respondent agreed to bring the impugned behaviour to an end and to return the business card.\n[50] The next day, April 24, 1998, the Respondent wrote the following letter to Messrs. Fraser and Vaughan (the text is unaltered):\nTo: Brother Jim\/Dave\nJim I wanted to talk to you, sorry I was with my Boss. Jim\/Dave, I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody. Plse-Plse don\u2019t take me wrong way. I have excellent reputation at work I respect other people. I have Connie\u2019s card which I\u2019ll give you tomorrow and I\u2019ll earn the card back with respect. I did nothing wrong. I\u2019ll not call Connie if I\u2019m at work with an appointment & respectfully. I hope that you will understand me. If you want I\u2019m willing to give you the office key\/pass.\nThis is just the note, don\u2019t take wrong way. I talk to respect plse. I\u2019m not bad.\nThx Arvind.\nThe Complainant\u2019s business card was indeed returned by the Respondent to Mr. Fraser the following day. Messrs. Vaughan and Fraser did not ask the Respondent to hand in his office key and pass.\n(x) Changes in the Complainant\u2019s Behaviour [51] The Complainant claims that as a consequence of the Respondent\u2019s actions, she was forced to make numerous changes in her life. She did not live far from her office and was in the habit of walking to and from work. After the April 18th incident, she started driving to her job out of fear that the Respondent would confront her while walking and assault her.\n[52] She resolved to never allow herself to be alone with the Respondent again. To this end, she informed her manager, Gilles S\u00e9guin, about her problems with the Respondent. Mr. S\u00e9guin advised her that if the Respondent showed up, she could leave her cubicle and come to his office or go to the section\u2019s common area. As is further discussed below, the Complainant alleges that by May 1998, the Respondent had resumed his daily visits to her office. She therefore began to leave her office whenever he was likely to come by, and go elsewhere, such as the cafeteria. She ended up having to work later hours in order to make up for the time she lost earlier in the day, while away from her desk.\n[53] The Complainant claims that she also stopped going to the Local office alone. Ordinarily, Mr. Fraser left for home at about 4:00 p.m. The Complainant now had to make sure to take care of any union business at the Local office prior to Mr. Fraser\u2019s departure. This often meant that she had to leave earlier from her job at Canada Post.\n[54] She contends that all of these changes had a negative impact on her performance at work as well as on her ability to function as President.\n(xi) Renewed Contact by the Respondent after the April 18, 1998 Incident [55] The Complainant alleges that within a few days after her letter to the Respondent and his conversations with Messrs. Fraser and Vaughan, during which he agreed to not contact her except for union-related business, he resumed his uninvited visits, calls and other communications regarding matters that had nothing to do with the Local\u2019s activities.\n[56] On April 28, 1998, the Respondent sent the Complainant an e-mail message containing a summary of a management course for women that was being offered at Carleton University. The Respondent stated at the top of the message, Connie, you should attend this program. At about the same time, he spoke to her by telephone about their going together to purchase two new filing cabinets for the Local office. She told him that new cabinets were not needed but that if he insisted on making the acquisition, he was to discuss the matter with Mr. Fraser and make the purchase with him. She considers this request to be another attempt by him to be alone with her.\n[57] In May 1998, the Complainant began visiting her office again. She claims that his comments during these visits were usually sexual in nature. He related his sexual fantasies about her, described his preferred sexual positions, and repeatedly asked to have sex with her. She always told him that she would not have any sexual relations with him and reminded him that he had been warned to stop this behaviour.\n[58] The Complainant testified that on one occasion, the Respondent had shown up at her office and began saying that he wanted to have sex with her and that he would not leave her alone unless she did. She shouted back to him to get the fuck out of her office and cease this form of conduct. Her objections were so loud that Mr. Hudon\u2019s attention was drawn away from his work and he rose to see what was going on in the neighbouring cubicle. In his testimony, Mr. Hudon recalled seeing the Respondent rush past him heading out of the Complainant\u2019s office. She, on the other hand, remembers that the Respondent was still in her office when Mr. Hudon walked in. She turned to the Respondent and said, Go ahead, Arvind, tell him, tell him you were demanding sex from me. The Respondent denied her charge and then ran out of the office.\n[59] She was so upset, Mr. Hudon had to sit with her for a while to calm her down. He recalls that she was crying in great sobs and was somewhat incoherent. He tried to comfort her but, although he is a fairly close friend of hers, he did not think it appropriate at that time to ask about what happened.\n[60] Mr. Hudon testified that the Respondent would ask him where the Complainant was, whenever he passed by and did not find her. Mr. Hudon refused to answer, since the Complainant had specifically asked him to not divulge her whereabouts. As a result, the Respondent used to leave numerous messages in the Complainant\u2019s voice mail box, often saying that he needed to talk to her and hear her voice.\n[61] During a weekend in the month of May 1998, the PSAC held a meeting in Hull. Four members of the Local Executive attended, including the Complainant and the Respondent. The Complainant drove everyone to the meeting in her car. On the way back, the Respondent made several comments regarding an upcoming series of labour college courses that the Complainant was to take at the University of Ottawa. The program required that she reside on the university campus for the duration of the training session, which was to last for one month, beginning May 25th. Mr. Vaughan, the Vice President, had been assigned all of her union functions and responsibilities in her absence. The Respondent stated that he wanted her phone number and address at the university campus so that he could call her during the day and come by and visit her, together with his wife, at night. The Complainant told him that she would not give him this information. He was insistent on obtaining it, claiming that she was being rude and insensitive in not providing it. Eventually, one of the other Executive members, Mr. Zarichansky, intervened and stated, in a fairly assertive manner, that the Complainant had clearly said no to the Respondent\u2019s request and that he should leave her alone.\n[62] When the labour college session ended, a graduation ceremony was held at the university. Several members of the Local Executive attended the event including Mr. Fraser, Mr. Zarichansky and the Respondent. As the Complainant looked out into the audience that day, she saw the Respondent standing with a large bouquet of roses in his arms. She feared that the Respondent was planning on giving her the flowers that he had been talking about for months and that, at the same time, he would finally manage to kiss her in public, as he had first announced to her when he drove her home in March. She was afraid that she would be unable to avoid his embrace. As luck would have it, the ceremony ran long and the Respondent had to leave to attend his child\u2019s birthday party. He handed off the bouquet to Mr. Fraser. According to Mr. Fraser\u2019s testimony, the Respondent had brought the flowers to the event and they were not paid for from the Local\u2019s funds.\n[63] Since the Respondent never learned how to reach the Complainant at the university, she did not hear from him at all during the training session. When she returned to her Canada Post office in late June 1998, she found numerous messages in her voice mail box from the Respondent in which he stated that he needed to hear her voice and asked her to call him. She also found an e-mail message sent by the Respondent to her on June 12, 1998. The message was not related in any way to the union\u2019s activities. It consisted of a file attachment containing a skill-testing quiz and a comment from the Respondent that he was certain the Complainant would score 98% on the quiz.\n(xii) Events after the Complainant\u2019s Return from Labour College [64] The Respondent began calling the Complainant again as soon as she returned to work. She reminded him each time that she did not want him to phone her. On occasions when she was away from her office, the Respondent left messages in her voice mail box, asking that she call him. The Complainant describes the tone of his voice on these messages as anxious. Whenever he managed to speak to her, he often explained that all he wanted to do was hear her voice. The Complainant continued her practice of calling Mr. Fraser and Mr. Vaughan after receiving the Respondent\u2019s calls. She testified that by this time, she had begun to feel more worried about and afraid of the Respondent\u2019s conduct, having reached the conclusion that he was obsessed with her. She therefore discussed with Mr. Fraser and Mr. Vaughan the possibility of restricting the Respondent\u2019s access to the Local office by taking away his pass and keys, but they felt that this would be an overreaction and a possible violation of his rights.\n[65] The Local had acquired a new computer in July 1998, and a software package that was in widespread use at Canada Post was installed on it. The package included the Lotus spreadsheet program. The Respondent called the Complainant and requested that she train him on the program. She flatly refused, especially since the program formed part of the package that he was already presumably using at his Canada Post job. She perceived his request as yet another excuse to get her in a room alone with him.\n[66] The Respondent served as a union representative on the Joint Health and Safety Committee. The committee\u2019s functions included the conduct of annual workplace inspections regarding the health and safety of Canada Post employees. On July 16, 1998, the Respondent and a management representative carried out the annual inspection on the Complainant\u2019s floor in the East Tower. The Complainant alleges that at one point during the day, while she was on the telephone, she looked up and saw the Respondent standing at her cubicle\u2019s entrance, staring at her and listening to her conversation. He told her she looked unhappy and suggested that the union should buy her flowers to make her feel better. She again reminded him that such a purchase would be inappropriate and that he had already been advised in her letter to cease making these comments.\n[67] As a result of what she came to regard as the Respondent\u2019s obsession with her, she developed a fear for her safety. This led her to make additional changes to her lifestyle. For instance, she ceased her lunch hour walking and running exercises for fear of crossing paths with the Respondent. She also stopped going to the park at Mooney\u2019s Bay, near her apartment, because she knew that he used to go there often with his family. She even contemplated resigning from the Local Executive, having been frustrated by her fellow union representatives\u2019 unwillingness to intervene.\n[68] Her fear was compounded by certain statements that the Respondent made to her in late June or early July 1998, about his impending change of residence. The Respondent informed the Complainant that he was planning to move to a location that was only ten minutes away from her home. She alleges that he said he would be living so close to her that he intended to come by and visit her during weekends and evenings. The evidence is that by August 1998, the Respondent and his family did indeed move into a house owned by his father, which is located a short distance away from the Complainant\u2019s apartment.\n[69] On Friday, July 17, 1998, the Respondent called the Complainant and told her that he would be seeing her the next day. She pointed out to him that the next day was a Saturday and she had no intention of seeing him. He replied that he intended to drop by and visit her at what she assumed was her apartment. She advised him to stay away. Over the course of the weekend, she made sure not to be at home, in case he attempted to visit her. The following Monday, July 20, the Respondent called her early in the morning and asked her how her weekend was.\n[70] She was now very concerned, sensing that the Respondent had moved beyond the workplace and was invading her home territory. She therefore wrote a second letter to the Respondent, dated July 20, 1998, on the Local\u2019s stationery, in which she stated the following (the text has not been altered from the original):\nJuly 20, 1998\nArvind Sharma\nRegarding: Continuation of Inappropriate Behavior\nIn April 1998, you received a warning letter regarding inappropriate comments and behavior that you had directed towards me. Over the past three months, I do not feel that you have improved on you comments or behavior towards me.\nIt has been noted that you are at the Local several times a week. I personally have noted that you go in to sign a cheque and the next day you are into do one other small task. If appears that you are in the office so many times because you are seeking an opportunity to be with me alone. Due to the initial inappropriate behavior, I no longer feel safe and comfortable to go into the Local during the evening or on the weekend. This is mainly due to the fact that I do not know when you will be there and if you are there what types of comments or behavior that will be exhibited towards me. This is affecting my efficiency as the President of the Local and the efficiency of the Local in the service we provide to the membership.\nAlthough, there has been several comments, the most inappropriate and worrisome comments came over the past week. When you indicated I was required to provide you with training on the computer, I firmly and repeatedly told you that I would not provide the training. You responded that I had to provide you training and the trainer had to be me. Even though I said NO several times, you insisted that I train you. Your lack of understanding of the word NO is a very simple word. As you are well versed in the use of computers and the operations of the computer, I do not believe that you needed training on the computer. I really question your motives as to why you would insist on being trained by me. In my opinion, this was your latest plan for you to be alone with me. In the future, I do not want you to arrange or plan situations where you are alone with me.\nOn Thursday, July 16, you stated to me that that Local should buy me flowers to cheer me up. This is similar to the situation when you wanted the Local to buy me flowers and a dress for my birthday. It has been explained to you that the I and the other members of the Local Executive considers this behavior very inappropriate and not acceptable.\nOn Friday, July 17, you stated that you will be seeing me on the weekend. I am uncertain as to why you seem to think that you would be seeing me. In fact the way you said the comment, I was uncertain if you were planning to see me at the Local or if you were planning to stop by my apartment. As I had never discussed or planned to see you this weekend, I am uncertain how you came about with this idea. This could be considered as a form of stalking. This behavior threatens my safety which has a high emotional impact on the victim (me). This further leads me to believe that you are seeking the opportunity to see me alone.\nOn Monday, July 20, you phoned me and stated that you were calling to see how my weekend was. It has been noted that you do not call Jim or Dave or Ken. Is this your way of singling me out so that you can talk to me each and every day?\nThis behavior must stop or further action will be taken. This could lead to formal charges that will be made public through the disciplinary process.\nSincerely\n[signed]\nConnie Bushey\nPresident, UPCE, Local 70180\nThe Complainant provided copies of the letter to Messrs. Murray, Matchett, Vaughan and Fraser. At the Complainant\u2019s request, Messrs. Vaughan and Fraser met with the Respondent to hand him the letter. Although the Respondent read the letter, he refused to keep it and he handed it back. Messrs. Vaughan and Fraser told him to stop bothering the Complainant, and he apparently consented.\n[71] Later that day, the Respondent sent the following hand-written letter to Mr. Murray (the text has not been altered from the original):\nBrother Jim Murray,\nAs our conversation this afternoon, the letter provide to me by Jim Fraser & Dave Vaughan are false and incorrect. I did nothing wrong. I\u2019ll not phone Connie at work instead for union business I\u2019ll phone at the Local.\nI\u2019m hard worker, honest & helping nature individual. I can say so many things about somebody but they don\u2019t mean they are correct.\nTo solve this problem, I want to meet you, Connie, Tom Matchett personally to over with the family domestic misunderstanding problem. I work until 3:30 PM. Plse let me know when we can meet. I will not resign. I want to move forward.\nLater that week, the Complainant met with a person responsible for security at Canada Post. This individual advised her that the conduct of the Respondent, as described by her, could constitute a form of stalking. He also informed her that complaints could be filed with the employer, the union, the police and the Canadian Human Rights Commission. However, having been already notified about the Respondent\u2019s request for a meeting, she decided to hold off on the filing of any complaint until after the meeting.\n(xiii) July 27, 1998 Meeting [72] Pursuant to the Respondent\u2019s request in his July 20th letter, a meeting was convened at the Local office, on July 27, 1998, attended by Messrs. Murray, Matchett, Vaughan and Fraser, together with the Respondent and the Complainant. Mr. Matchett presided over the meeting. According to the Complainant, it was readily apparent to her that the topic of the meeting for the other union representatives was how to resolve the problem so as to maintain the efficient operation of the Local. There was no interest in actually dealing with the Respondent\u2019s behaviour. The Complainant notes that the collective bargaining period was fast approaching and the UPCE could not afford to have outstanding tensions within its largest local.\n[73] The Complainant claims that as she recounted the incidents to the others, the Respondent continuously interjected with objections and denials, shouting that\u2019s not true and you\u2019re lying. When he denied having suggested that the Local buy her flowers and a dress, Mr. Fraser stepped in and told the Respondent, Yes you did, so stop lying. Although the Respondent initially denied the Complainant\u2019s accusations regarding his repeated requests for sex, he eventually conceded It\u2019s not three times I demanded sex from you, it was once, and I was drunk.\n[74] Eventually, a proposal was put forth that the Respondent resign from the Health and Safety Committee, that he undertake to visit the Local office on Wednesdays only and that he cease contacting the Complainant. She claims that while the others may have felt that a consensus was reached in the room to accept this proposal as a resolution to the problem, she never expressed any acceptance. She noted that Mr. Matchett closed the meeting by telling the Respondent to just continue with what you are doing and instructing her to stop writing letters to the Respondent. She therefore perceived the proposal as an implicit approval of the Respondent\u2019s stalking and demands for sex.\n[75] Disappointed with the outcome of this meeting, the Complainant decided to take action against the Respondent. On July 31, 1998, she filed a human rights complaint with the Human Rights section of Canada Post. On August 4, 1998, she laid charges with the PSAC and UPCE, against the Respondent, in accordance with the PSAC\u2019s Constitution and the UPCE\u2019s By-laws. She alleged that the Respondent had engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the good order and discipline of the union and that he had sexually or personally harassed her.\n[76] On August 10, 1998, the Respondent sent a letter to Mr. Murray informing him that he was resigning as Treasurer of the Local, effective the same day.\n[77] On August 31, 1998, Mr. Fraser and the Complainant met with an investigator of the Ottawa\u2011Carleton Regional Police. A file was opened in the Complainant\u2019s name regarding the Respondent, so that in the event she ever felt the need to call for assistance, the police would already be aware of the background to the case. For additional security, the Complainant gave the police file number to her manager, Mr. S\u00e9guin.\n[78] On October 30, 1998, Canada Post communicated the findings from its investigation into the Complainant\u2019s internal human rights complaint. The investigation was conducted by Ms. Leslie Hine, Human Rights Co-ordinator at Canada Post, who testified that she gathered information by interviewing numerous witnesses, one on one, including the Complainant and the Respondent. Neither the Respondent nor the Complainant were present during the interviews of the other witnesses. Ms. Hine took notes during the interviews. In most cases, the notes were shown to the witnesses and signed by them. Canada Post concluded that the Respondent\u2019s obsessive behaviour and unwelcome sexual requests [were] unacceptable and cannot be condoned by the corporation. The employer therefore ordered the Respondent to attend a human rights sensitization course, to provide a full and frank apology to the Complainant and to cease having any contact with her. In addition, he was suspended from work without pay for two weeks and a copy of the letter setting out these conclusions was placed on his personal file. Any violation of these conditions would result in the immediate termination of his employment. The Respondent initially filed a grievance against the employer\u2019s decision but the grievance was later abandoned.\n[79] Also on October 30, 1998, the National Executive of the UPCE placed the Local under trusteeship due to serious questions that were raised about its ability to function. The Complainant and the other Executive members were advised that they no longer held their offices. When the Local was brought out of trusteeship a year later, the Complainant was re-elected President.\n[80] The union investigation committee that enquired into the Complainant\u2019s charges against the Respondent concluded that he had sexually or personally harassed her. The UPCE National Executive adopted the committee\u2019s report and on June 1, 1999, the National Board of Directors of the PSAC suspended the Respondent\u2019s membership in the union for a period of five years.\n[81] On December 23, 1998, the Complainant filed with the Commission, the present human rights complaint against the Respondent. Separate human rights complaints were also filed with the Commission against the PSAC and the UPCE, in which the Complainant alleged that these employee organizations had failed to provide her with a workplace free from harassment. These latter complaints were settled several weeks before the start of the hearing into the complaint against the Respondent.\n(xiv) Measures Taken by the Complainant to Avoid Contact with the Respondent [82] The Complainant testified that one of the principal fears that she developed as a result of the Respondent\u2019s alleged behaviour was that he would come to her apartment, particularly after he moved his residence to a location nearby. She claims to have notified her building\u2019s manager and superintendents about her concerns regarding the Respondent. More importantly, although she enjoyed living in the apartment that she had occupied ever since moving to Ottawa eleven years before, she decided that she had to move as far away as possible from the city, so as to make it difficult for the Respondent to visit her. She started looking for a new home in December 1998, and by June 1999, she had purchased and moved into a house located well outside the city. She has continued to work at Canada Post and her commute now takes 1\u00bd hours. She must now drive to work whereas she used to be able to conveniently walk there from her apartment. She has deliberately not installed a telephone in her new home but instead uses a cellular phone only, with a number that is not published in any phone book.\n[83] Both the Complainant and the Respondent have since changed offices and buildings within the Canada Post complex. Nonetheless, special security measures have been put in place at work by her employer. Her name is not posted anywhere, including her office door and employee lists. Her desk is always placed in a central and public area, away from any corners or stairwells. The Respondent is not allowed access to the building in which the Complainant works.\n[84] The Complainant acknowledged in her testimony that the Respondent has not spoken to or contacted her again since 1998. In one chance encounter in a store about one year ago, he turned around and walked away from her. The Complainant contends that the change in his conduct can be attributed to his fear of losing his job if he were to ever violate Canada Post\u2019s order that he never come into contact with her.\nB. The Respondent\u2019s Perspective [85] The Respondent denies the Complainant\u2019s contention that he joined the Local Executive in order to gain an opportunity to keep company with her. The Respondent claims that when he attended the union meeting in September 1997, he noticed that there were no members of visible minority groups on the Local Executive and thought that by getting involved he could become a role model for others. In addition, he saw it as an opportunity to improve his English language skills and to become acquainted with other employees from different departments. He also acknowledges that he was pleasantly surprised to learn that Local Executive Members received a modest fee in return for their participation.\n[86] The Respondent agrees that he made telephone calls to the Complainant and visited her occasionally, but contends that their conversations always related to union activities. For instance, he regularly came to her office to get her signature on Mr. Fraser\u2019s pay and expense reimbursement cheques. The Respondent then delivered the cheques to Mr. Fraser\u2019s spouse, who worked in a neighbouring building. About four or five of the fifteen to twenty cheques issued each month were made payable to Mr. Fraser. The Respondent categorically denies that his calls and visits occurred with the frequency suggested by the Complainant. The visits were no more than three or four per week, he contends, and would only occur at the Complainant\u2019s request. In addition, the reason that he often went to the Local office after work was because many of the Local\u2019s books and other documents were in disorder and the task of reorganizing them took some time.\n[87] The Respondent points out that his job did not allow him to be away from his office as often as implied in the Complainant\u2019s testimony. He was supervising two other employees during this period and they relied on him for advice. He had to be available for them at all times. The Respondent\u2019s supervisor at the time, Mr. Chiumera, testified that he had not noticed any abnormal absences. Yet, on cross-examination, Mr. Chiumera admitted that he never tracked or monitored the Respondent\u2019s ordinary work breaks and he would not have noticed if the Respondent was away from his desk for even as many as ten minutes. Mr. Chiumera agreed that it does not take more than a couple of minutes to go down by elevator to the Complainant\u2019s floor. Mr. Chiumera was interviewed by Ms. Hine on August 31, 1998, in the context of the Canada Post human rights investigation. According to her notes, which Mr. Chiumera had read and signed at the end of the interview, he recalled that the Respondent had been away from his desk or on the phone more often [although] not more often than his usual break time, ever since he joined the union Executive.\n[88] The Respondent is also adamant that no discussions of a sexual nature took place between him and the Complainant. They did engage in friendly conversations about some aspects of their personal lives, such as his arranged marriage. She spoke to him about some of her family background too. However, he insists that no conversations ever occurred relating to how beautiful she was, his sexual fantasies, their having sex or anything else of the sort. He describes his relationship with the Complainant as friendly and he considered her as a sister.\n[89] The Respondent contends that the only items of furniture that he recommended should be purchased for the Local office were office chairs, filing cabinets and a desk. He also felt that the refrigerator should be replaced. He insists, however, that he never suggested buying a new couch. He submits that the Complainant, Mr. Fraser and Mr. Vaughan are against him and were lying when they claimed otherwise in their testimonies.\n[90] The Respondent denied ever suggesting that the Local hold a party for the Complainant or buy her a dress and flowers. In addition, the Respondent intimated that the atmosphere in the restaurant, in which he allegedly suggested that the Local buy the Complainant a dress and hold her a party, was too loud for Messrs. Hudon, Vaughan and Fraser to have heard his supposed comment. He noted that these witnesses were unable to recall many other details from that outing. As for the flowers that he held at the Complainant\u2019s graduation ceremony, the Respondent claims that they were not purchased by him, but rather by the Local, and that Mr. Fraser had brought them to the ceremony. At a certain point, Mr. Fraser handed them over to Mr. Zarichansky who later passed them over to the Respondent.\n[91] In his evidence, the Respondent did not deny or comment in any way about the remarks that he is alleged to have made to the Complainant in his car when he drove her home on March 10, 1998, nor, more importantly, with respect to the incident of physical contact that the Complainant claims took place in the Local office on April 18, 1998.\n[92] The Respondent acknowledges that a meeting took place on April 21, 1998 between himself and Messrs. Vaughan and Fraser, during which he was presented with the Complainant\u2019s April 19th letter and told to no longer go to her office. He was angered by their comments and denied the alleged conduct. He was upset that this issue had never been raised with him before. The Respondent claims that Messrs. Vaughan and Fraser told him to drop by the Local office later that afternoon to write up a letter of apology addressed to the Complainant and that the matter would then be over with. If he failed to do so, they threatened to make the allegations known publicly. The Respondent showed up at the Local office as he was advised to do, but he insists that he did not draft the letter of apology. He claims that he simply typed the text as it was dictated to him by Mr. Vaughan. After the Respondent printed and signed the letter, he left it with Mr. Vaughan for delivery to the Complainant. Both Mr. Fraser and Mr. Vaughan, who were called as witnesses by the Commission, testified that they did not participate in the preparation of the Respondent\u2019s letter of apology and that they did not assist in the composition of its text.\n[93] The Respondent further asserts that he did not call the Complainant at home later that evening (April 21) to invite her to the shop stewards\u2019 meeting. However, he admits that he did phone her at work three days later to speak to her about the letter that she had sent him. She invited him down to her office to discuss the matter. When he arrived, he noticed that his letter of apology was on her desk. She told him that he was not being respectful of her and that he should apologize. He replied that he had already provided an apology but he was prepared to go even further. As a demonstration of his respect for her, and to show her that he was not bad and would not hurt her, he wrote out the message on the Post-It note paper, referred to earlier in this decision, and placed it on his letter of apology. She threw both documents in her garbage can and told him to go back to work.\n[94] In the days and weeks that followed, the Respondent claims that when he and the Complainant ran into each other in the Local office, they exchanged simple pleasantries, asking each other how they and their families were, how their weekend was, and so on. Aside from these conversations, he did not speak to her about anything other than union-related matters, such as her approving his participation at a UPCE conference in Montreal. His relations with her were professional.\n[95] During the course of this conference, which was held in May 1998, the Respondent claims that none of the other union representatives present, including Messrs. Hudon, Matchett and Murray, complained to him about his conduct with respect to the Complainant. He acknowledges, however, that he never asked them their opinion on the matter either.\n[96] It is the Respondent\u2019s contention that his family\u2019s decision to change residence had nothing to do with his attempting to live near the Complainant\u2019s home. The Respondent, his wife and his children had been residing in a flat in central Ottawa. This residence lacked a backyard in which the children could play and the living space was relatively limited. The Respondent\u2019s father owns several residential properties within the city, including the one in which they had been living and the one to which they moved. The latter property is a single family dwelling with a large backyard, and is situated only a few minutes\u2019 distance from the Respondent\u2019s workplace. The property had been purchased by the Respondent\u2019s father almost two decades before. Due to some delay related to the departure of the previous tenants of the house, the Respondent was not able to take possession of the house until July 1998.\n[97] According to the Respondent, there are several incidents that serve to demonstrate that he was not harassing the Complainant and that she willingly interacted with him. Early in April 1998, he claims that she sought his assistance in using the income tax preparation software known as QuickTax. He and Mr. Hudon had distributed copies of the program to union members to help them prepare their returns. The Respondent also recalls the Complainant asking for his support if she ran for the position of national President of the UPCE and promising to support his candidacy for Local President. He also claims that the Complainant called him and asked to be e-mailed the skill-testing quiz, which he sent her on June 12.\n[98] Some time in May or June 1998, the Respondent and his family were caught in an elevator at the CLC building, in which the Local office was located. They only managed to escape with the assistance of the fire department. When the Complainant heard about the incident, she invited the Respondent to her office to discuss it and any measures that needed to be taken. On another occasion, also in May or June 1998, the Executive was having a meal at a restaurant and the Respondent recalls Mr. Fraser commenting how good it was that the Complainant and the Respondent had put their differences behind them and were friendly with each other again. Presumably, the Complainant made no effort to contradict this remark. According to the Respondent, these events, coupled with the fact that the Complainant did not file a complaint with any authority from February to July 1998, demonstrate that their relationship was friendly and that he was not harassing her.\n[99] The Respondent was therefore angered when Messrs. Vaughan and Fraser presented him with the Complainant\u2019s letter of July 20, 1998. He disagreed with the letter\u2019s content, although he read only a portion of it before handing it back in rejection. In his opinion, it was he who was being harassed by the Complainant and he made it clear to the other gentlemen that he would not sign another letter of apology. The Respondent offered to resign his Executive post, but Messrs. Vaughan and Fraser again advised him against it. The Respondent then contacted Messrs. Matchett and Murray and asked them to call a meeting in order to resolve the matter, once and for all.\n[100] That meeting was held on July 27th and, according to the Respondent, an agreement was reached. He points out that although Mr. Fraser\u2019s original suggestion was that the Respondent only visit the Local office on Wednesdays, it was the Complainant who intervened and specifically requested that he be required to resign from the Health and Safety Committee as well. The Respondent therefore disagrees with her contention that she did not accept the proposal that was put forth during the meeting. He notes that following the meeting, he acted in compliance with the understanding that was reached, by resigning from the Committee, curtailing his visits to the Local and eliminating all contact with the Complainant.\n[101] The Respondent was, as a result, surprised to be informed that the Complainant had filed a human rights complaint against him with Canada Post and with the union. He spoke to his Director and to a human resources officer at Canada Post, about the matter. Upon obtaining further advice from his family, the Respondent decided to resign his position on the Local Executive. The Respondent was later interviewed alone by Ms. Hine over the course of several days. As he answered her questions during the interview, Ms. Hine took notes. On October 20, 1998, Ms. Hine met with the Respondent and handed him her notes for review by him. He refused to read the document nor receive a copy, although he signed and dated the document nonetheless. The Respondent objects to the manner in which Ms. Hine conducted her investigation, citing her failure to interview some of the persons that he identified to her as important witnesses as well as her practice of not allowing him to sit in on the other interviews that she did conduct. The Respondent denies having made many of the statements attributed to him in Ms. Hine\u2019s notes from his interview.\n[102] In late October 1998, the Respondent was informed of Canada Post\u2019s decision regarding the human rights complaint, during a meeting with Ms. Hine, which was also attended by his Director and a UPCE representative. He disagreed with Canada Post\u2019s findings and filed a grievance that he later abandoned. He claims that he has complied with all the recommendations set out in the decision. As a result of the stress that the Respondent associates with the filing of the various complaints against him, he claims he has developed several medical problems, although no expert evidence was led in support of his contention.\n[103] The Respondent emphasized throughout his evidence that he is a person with a good reputation within Canada Post and the community at large. He is an industrious employee who regularly works extended hours in order to ensure that his job gets done. He has contributed to the union and its membership by, for instance, working within the Health and Safety Committee, setting up and providing software to union members for the preparation of their income tax returns, inquiring into the establishment of an internet website for the Local, and providing for a sound administration of the Local\u2019s funds. He has supervised other employees and worked with dozens of co-workers within the same workplace. He has worked in areas where 50% to 80% of the workforce is female. Yet, no one other than the Complainant has ever accused him of sexual harassment or any other wrongdoing. This evidence, he argues, supports his contention that he did not sexually harass the Complainant.\nII. Law [104] According to Section 14(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act[1] (Act), it is a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination, in matters related to employment. Sexual harassment is deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground (s. 14(2)).\n[105] As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Inc.,[2] sexual harassment is broadly defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victim of harassment. Sexual harassment in the workplace attacks the dignity and self-respect of the victim both as an employee and as a human being.\n[106] The Federal Court of Canada-Trial Division elaborated on this definition in Canada (HRC) v. Canada (Armed Forces) and Franke.[3] In order for a complaint of harassment to be substantiated, the Court stated that the following must be demonstrated:\nThe impugned conduct must be of a sexual nature. Requests for sexual favours and propositioning are sexual in nature and constitute a psychological form of sexual harassment. Acts of harassment may also be physical, such as pinching, grabbing, hugging, kissing and leering. The acts could be verbal in nature, as well, encompassing conduct such as gender-based insults or remarks regarding a person\u2019s appearance or sexual habits. The Tribunal\u2019s determination of what is sexual in nature is carried out in accordance with the standard of the reasonable person in the circumstances of the case, keeping in mind the prevailing social norms. The acts that are the subject of the complaint were unwelcome. In other words, it must be determined whether the alleged harasser\u2019s conduct was desired or solicited. This task can be accomplished by assessing the complainant\u2019s reaction at the time of the alleged incidents of harassment, and determining whether she expressly, or by her behaviour, demonstrated that the conduct was unwelcome. The Court recognized, however, that a verbal no is not required in all cases and that a repetitive failure to respond to a harasser\u2019s comments could constitute a signal to him that his conduct is unwelcome. In these cases, the appropriate standard to apply will again be that of a reasonable person in the circumstances. Ordinarily, harassment requires an element of persistence or repetition, but in certain circumstances even a single incident, such as a physical assault, may be severe enough to create a hostile environment. The objective reasonable person standard is used to assess this factor as well. The final factor arises where a complaint is filed against an employer regarding the conduct of one of its employees. Fairness requires that in such cases, the victim of the harassment, whenever possible, notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct. This factor is not relevant to the present case, in light of the fact that there is no complaint before the Tribunal regarding the employer\u2019s conduct.\n[107] In Stadnyk v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Comm.), the Federal Court of Appeal suggested that where proper expert evidence is before the Tribunal confirming that male-female interaction may be perceived differently by men than by women, then the appropriate standard against which to test for sexual harassment should be that of a reasonable woman.[4] In the present case, however, no such expert evidence was led.\nIII. Analysis A. Preliminary Issue \u2013 Jurisdiction [108] At the outset of the hearing, there was some discussion about whether the subject matter of the complaint fell within the jurisdiction of the Act and by extension, the Tribunal. According to s. 2, the Act applies to all matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament. The making of laws in respect of Canada's postal service constitutes one of the enumerated legislative powers of Parliament pursuant to s. 91(5) of the Constitution Act, 1867.[5] Although the Complainant and the Respondent both work for Canada Post, he only met and dealt with her as a result of their involvement with the union, and not, strictly speaking, in the course of their employment.\n[109] It is clear from the evidence, however, that many or even most of the alleged acts of misconduct occurred at the parties\u2019 place of employment, during working hours, notably as regards the Respondent\u2019s repeated visits and calls to the Complainant\u2019s office. Moreover, even the acts that allegedly occurred outside of Canada Post\u2019s premises came about within the context of the parties\u2019 work on behalf of their bargaining unit, which is itself inextricably linked to their employment. In other words, the interaction between the Complainant and the Respondent would never have taken place, but for their status as Canada Post employees that led to their union involvement. It seems to me that it is not essential for the facts giving rise to an employment-related harassment complaint to physically take place at the federally-regulated workplace. Any conduct, wherever it may occur, arising somehow in the context of federally-regulated employment is subject to the Act.\n[110] As the Trial Division of the Federal Court indicated in Cluff v. Canada (Department of Agriculture)[6], the matters related to employment, referred to in s. 14 of the Act, encompass activities that fairly and reasonably may be said to be incidental to the employment or logically and naturally connected with it. I find that the parties\u2019 involvement within the Local meets this definition, and that the subject matter of the complaint therefore falls within the purview of s. 14. As a result, the Tribunal possesses the jurisdiction to deal with the issues raised.\nB. Credibility of the Evidence [111] I must state at the outset that I prefer the Complainant\u2019s version of the facts over that of the Respondent on practically all counts. The Complainant\u2019s testimony was detailed, comprehensive, forthright and believable. To the contrary, the Respondent\u2019s general denials and suggestions that the Complainant and all of the other witnesses had fabricated much of their evidence are simply not credible.\n[112] The Complainant tendered into evidence detailed notes recounting the Respondent\u2019s conduct, which she had recorded contemporaneously with the alleged acts. These notes were consistent with her testimony and that of the other witnesses. Indeed, most of the witnesses who know the Complainant attested as to how meticulous and organized she is, both in her work and her union activities. It is entirely consistent with these accounts of her character, to have gathered and maintained this information in the manner presented.\n[113] Several of the witnesses at the hearing (Messrs. Vaughan, Hudon, Seguin, Chiumera, Fraser, Murray and Matchett) were interviewed by Ms. Hine. Interestingly, the testimony of these witnesses was in almost all respects consistent with the statements that had been recorded by Ms. Hine during her interviews that took place from August to October 1998, only a short time after the impugned conduct occurred.\n[114] Ms. Hine was herself called as a witness by the Respondent. She provided ample opportunity to these individuals to review and amend the notes, and several witnesses at the hearing pointed out sections where they had indeed corrected the text after having read it at the time. Furthermore, I was impressed with Ms. Hine\u2019s independent recollection of many of the answers given during these interviews, and the care with which, during her testimony before the Tribunal, she identified those elements of her notes that she did not independently recall. I am therefore satisfied that Ms. Hine\u2019s notes accurately reflect the content of her conversations with all of the persons she interviewed.\n[115] The Respondent was interviewed by Ms. Hine and her notes suggest that he acknowledged some of the material facts alleged against him. For instance, according to the notes, he concedes that he had discussed sex with the Complainant. He also states that one occasion, when he drank, [he] may have been more forward than usual with the Complainant. In his testimony, the Respondent denied having made these comments during the interview.\n[116] The Respondent, in contrast to the Complainant, was often vague in his evidence and, most remarkably, did not reply at all to some of the more significant allegations made against him. For instance, the Respondent did not comment upon, let alone contradict, the Complainant\u2019s allegations about the March 10th incident in his car and the allegations relating to the April 18th incident at the Local office. The matters that the Respondent chose to refute in his evidence were collateral to the essential aspects of the complaint and his evidence did not serve to undermine the Complainant\u2019s case.\n[117] An illustration of this is the manner with which the Respondent chose to deal with the question of his April 22nd letter of apology. The Respondent emphasized several times in his testimony that it was Mr. Vaughan who drafted the text of the letter. I do not find the Respondent\u2019s contention convincing. Messrs. Vaughan and Fraser, whose testimony I found credible overall, both denied having assisted the Respondent. More significantly, the usage in the letter of the expression time to time, suggests that the Respondent was the drafter. Commission counsel pointed out how on numerous occasions during the course of the hearing, the Respondent used the same expression in the identical fashion (that is, without being preceded by the preposition from, as is the usual practice). The Respondent\u2019s supervisor, Mr. Eloise, mentioned in his testimony that English is not the Respondent\u2019s first language and that some of his linguistic skills need improvement. Indeed, it is for this reason that the Respondent claims he sought assistance in drafting the letter. However, whether or not Mr. Vaughan assisted the Respondent has very little bearing on the question of determining whether he committed the discriminatory practices alleged. The Respondent appeared to suggest that the letter of apology could not be treated as an admission of his guilt if it was not drafted by him. Yet, irrespective of who drafted the letter, the Respondent signed it and he in fact testified that he agreed with its contents.\n[118] In any event, the Respondent sent a separate message of apology by e-mail earlier, on the morning of April 21st, which he acknowledges to have drafted himself. The Respondent did not specify in either document what he was sorry about and the evidence is that he had been performing his functions as Treasurer well to that point. The Complainant contends that the apology could therefore only be related to his acts of harassment, notably the April 18th incident at the Local office. The Respondent did not provide any alternate explanation in his evidence as to what his possible transgression could have been. As a result, the Complainant\u2019s contention was left uncontradicted by the Respondent.\n[119] Another collateral matter that preoccupied the Respondent was the fact that on October 23, 1998, the Complainant had circulated a document to other UPCE locals, in which she complained about the UPCE executive's conduct, including its handling of her complaints against the Respondent. At one point in the multi-page document, which included photocopies of the Complainant's prior correspondence with the UPCE executive, the Respondent's first name was mentioned, probably by inadvertence, since all of the other references to him elsewhere in the document had been stricken out. Yet, the Respondent devoted much energy at the hearing expressing his outrage that his identity had been disclosed, even though it was sent well after the alleged incidents of harassment, and was consequently of little or no relevance to the inquiry into the merits of the complaint.\n[120] I am mindful of the fact that the Respondent was not represented by legal counsel. While it is important for the Tribunal to afford unrepresented litigants a certain latitude in presenting their cases, particularly where an opposing party has the benefit of legal representation, they are nonetheless obliged to abide by the same evidentiary principles applicable to all human rights cases. All parties, whether represented or not, must suffer the consequences of failing to lead evidence that is essential to making their case or failing to answer the evidence that is led against them.\nC. Was the Respondent\u2019s Conduct Sexual in Nature? [121] I find that the Respondent\u2019s conduct was sexual in nature. For the reasons that I expressed just above, I accept the Complainant\u2019s evidence in its entirety with respect to the March 10th remarks by the Respondent outside her home, as well as the April 18th incident at the Local office. The Respondent\u2019s statements during both of these events were clearly sexual, consisting of nothing less than direct requests for sexual relations with the Complainant. Furthermore, the latter event was coupled with physical contact. His additional demands for sex, at the Local office, at her office, and by telephone, are also obviously sexual in nature. His conduct was, however, not limited to these comments. It also encompassed some of the behaviour mentioned in Franke as constituting other forms of sexual conduct, including staring or leering at the Complainant and his repeated compliments about her appearance. I find that the inordinate level of attention shown towards the Complainant by the Respondent, as demonstrated, for instance, by his desire to have the union buy her gifts and his attempts to communicate with her outside of the workplace, can also be reasonably perceived in the circumstances as having a sexual connotation.\n[122] I am therefore satisfied that the Respondent\u2019s conduct was of a sexual nature.\nD. Was the Respondent\u2019s Behaviour Unwelcome? [123] I am equally persuaded that the Complainant demonstrated to the Respondent that she did not welcome his behaviour. Her letters of April 18th and July 20th could not have been any clearer in expressing her rejection of his conduct. The detail with which she informs him of his inappropriate acts is remarkable. No reasonable person could ever perceive her statements as anything less than an outright disapproval of his behaviour. Yet, the Respondent did not alter his conduct, even after receiving the first letter. The Respondent seemed to suggest that his April 22nd letter of apology had mended the misunderstanding, as he perceived it, that had developed between him and the Complainant. He felt that he could maintain the same level of contact with the Complainant, as a result. Assuming there was ever any basis for him to entertain this thought, it should have been dispelled by the telephone call that he received on April 23rd from the Complainant and Messrs. Vaughan and Fraser, instructing him to cease contacting her. Instead of heeding this warning, however, he recommenced his visits and calls within days.\n[124] Besides, the Respondent possessed the necessary knowledge to ascertain that his conduct was unwelcome from the time he first joined the Local Executive, in February 1998. The Respondent acknowledged in his evidence that in September 1997, he completed a course offered by the PSAC on sexual harassment. Material regarding sexual harassment was available to all UPCE members, particularly the Local Executive officers. The PSAC Constitution and UPCE by-laws, of which one would expect Local Executive officers to have knowledge, set out these organizations\u2019 sexual harassment policies. In addition, in April 1998, the Respondent attended a lecture given at the Local with respect to personal and sexual harassment. At the May 1998 UPCE conference in Montreal, which the Respondent attended, a session on harassment was conducted. In June 1998, the Respondent attended a course on threats and behavioural awareness. With all this training and information provided or made available to him, the Respondent should reasonably have understood that his conduct was unacceptable. He certainly should have realized, as a result of the Complainant\u2019s constant refusals of his advances and her repeated demands that he leave her alone, that she did not welcome his actions.\n[125] I am therefore persuaded that the Respondent\u2019s behaviour was unwelcome.\nE. Was the Respondent\u2019s Behaviour Persistent or Severe Enough to Create a Hostile Environment? [126] I find that the Respondent\u2019s conduct was both severe and repetitive enough to poison the Complainant\u2019s environment, inside and outside her workplace. I accept her evidence that she felt compelled to leave her office and engage in other evasive tactics in order to minimize contact with the Respondent. His persistent behaviour led to her eventual fear for her physical well-being. Her cause for concern was reinforced by the unwanted physical contact against her that took place at the Local office on April 18th. While it is true that the Respondent eventually lifted his grasp from her arms and complied with her demands that he step away, his actions that day alone were serious enough to create a hostile environment, particularly in light of her prior clear and unequivocal rejections of his sexual advances. There is no room for him to claim any misunderstanding on his part.\n[127] I am persuaded that any reasonable person would find that the Respondent\u2019s behaviour created a hostile environment for the Complainant.\n[128] For all the above reasons, I have concluded that the Respondent sexually harassed the Complainant, contrary to s. 14 of the Act.\nIV. Remedy [129] Having concluded that the Respondent sexually harassed the Complainant, I must now determine what remedy, if any, is appropriate. The Tribunal's remedial jurisdiction is set out in s. 53 of the Act, which contemplates the imposition of remedies designed to prevent future discrimination as well as to compensate individual victims. The goal of compensation is to make the victim whole for the damage caused by the act that is the source of the liability. Only the part of the loss that is reasonably foreseeable is recoverable.[7]\nA. Expenses Related to the Complainant's Change of Residence [130] The Complainant claims that as a result of the Respondent's conduct, which she feared had now developed into a form of stalking, she was compelled to move to a new residence, well outside Ottawa. She hoped that the move to an undisclosed and distant location would prevent, or at least discourage, the Respondent from contacting her outside the workplace. Her decision was prompted in large part by the Respondent's change of residence to a home near the apartment in which she was living at the time. She is therefore seeking compensation for the expenses arising from the move and the additional disbursements incurred by her, due to the distance of the new location from Ottawa. The Complainant testified that she was happy with her apartment and, in particular, with its central location that allowed her to walk to work. Prior to the incidents of sexual harassment, she had not considered changing her residence.\n[131] I am persuaded that the Complainant's fears were genuine and reasonable in light of the Respondent's continued contact with the Complainant, notwithstanding the numerous directions to him that he cease this behaviour immediately. The Complainant testified that a senior security officer with Canada Post, whom she consulted in July 1998 for advice, told her that the Respondent's conduct corresponded with the profile that is often assigned to stalkers. This information served to reinforce her concern that the Respondent posed a real threat to her mental and even her physical well-being, especially when one considers that he had already physically forced himself upon her on at least one occasion.\n[132] In this context, I am satisfied that her decision to move away, in reaction to the threat that he posed was reasonably foreseeable and that damages related to this decision are therefore recoverable. There exists, however, a duty on complainants to mitigate their damages.[8] The Complainant in this case seeks reimbursement of the costs associated with the purchase of the single family house to which she moved after she left her apartment. While I have no reason to doubt the Complainant\u2019s sincerity with respect to her affirmation that she had no intention of moving at all, let alone purchasing a house, prior to the harassment that she suffered at the hands of the Respondent, it seems to me that her duty to mitigate her loss calls for her to at least seek out similar accommodations, to the extent possible. She would then, for instance, have been in a position to claim any possible excess rental costs associated with her new dwelling.\n[133] No evidence was led to suggest that it was difficult or impossible for the Complainant to find a rental unit that would meet her need to distance herself from the Respondent. I find it inappropriate for the Respondent to be obliged to pay the costs associated with the acquisition by the Complainant of a new asset, one that she may sell some day in the future, possibly at a profit. To put it another way, while the Complainant\u2019s move to a location that is distant from the Respondent\u2019s home may have been reasonably foreseeable, the decision by her to purchase a house as a result, was not. I therefore find that the Complainant is not entitled to the costs relating to the acquisition of her home in June 1999.\n[134] The costs that she is entitled to recover are the following:\nExpenses related to the move of her furniture and other personal effects: $817.50 Parking fees at work (the Complainant no longer lives within walking distance from her workplace): 750.00 Change of postal address notice: 32.00 New utility hook-ups: 95.00 Higher costs associated with cell phone usage instead of land line: 762.00 Additional automobile-related costs associated with the increased usage arising from the long distance commute to work: 4,200.00\nTotal: $6,656.50\n[135] The Respondent is ordered to pay to the Complainant the sum of $6,656.50, in compensation for the expenses incurred by her as a result of the discriminatory practice (s. 53(2)(c) of the Act).\nB. Letter of Apology [136] The Commission and the Complainant request a letter of apology from the Respondent. At the time of the hearing, the judicial review of the Tribunal decision in Stevenson v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service[9] was still pending before the Federal Court-Trial Division. One of the issues before the Court was whether the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal possesses the jurisdiction to order respondents to issue letters of apology. Under these circumstances, the Commission and the Complainant requested that the Tribunal retain jurisdiction on this matter pending the outcome of the Court\u2019s judgment.\n[137] The Court\u2019s decision was released on March 24, 2003.[10] The Court found that the Act cannot be interpreted in such a manner as to empower the Tribunal to make such orders. This decision is binding on this Tribunal and the request for a letter of apology is therefore denied.\nC. Pain and Suffering [138] Section 53(2)(e) of the Act provides that a person found to have engaged in a discriminatory practice may be ordered to compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding $20,000, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice. The Complainant in the present case is requesting that the Respondent be ordered to pay the maximum amount.\n[139] This statutory provision, together with s. 53(3) (which relates to compensation in cases where the discriminatory conduct was wilful or reckless, and which is further discussed later in this decision), took effect on June 30, 1998. Due to the fact that the Respondent\u2019s discriminatory conduct continued beyond this date, these provisions are applicable to the present complaint.[11]\n[140] There is no question that the Respondent\u2019s harassment of the Complainant caused a major disruption in her life and significantly affected her well-being. She testified as to the effect that his behaviour had on her emotional state, which included bouts of crying, a growing impatience with work colleagues and others, a pronounced fear of coming into contact with the Respondent and a sense of violation and embarrassment. Several of the witnesses were well-acquainted with the Complainant. They testified as to how independent and strong-willed the Complainant was prior to the Respondent\u2019s harassment, and how her temperament worsened demonstrably during the course of the period when she was harassed. Her performance at her job also deteriorated as a result of the stress she was experiencing and the measures that she adopted to avoid coming into contact with the Respondent.\n[141] After several months, the Complainant managed to bring her life back to a state of relative normalcy. However, this only came about after she made the decision to move far away from her previous home and after significant security measures were implemented at her workplace that remain in place to this day.\n[142] Taking into consideration all of the relevant circumstances, I order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant the sum of $12,000 in compensation for her pain and suffering.\n[143] It appears that as part of the settlement agreement that was reached regarding the complaints that had been filed against the UPCE and the PSAC, the Complainant received some financial compensation for her pain and suffering. My assessment of the damages for her pain and suffering regarding the present complaint, however, takes into account only those factors that relate directly to the discriminatory conduct of the Respondent. These damages are severable from those caused by the conduct of the unions. As such, I am satisfied that no issue of double indemnification arises and that the sums received by the Complainant from the unions need not be deducted from the amounts being awarded in the present decision.\nD. Wilful and Reckless Behaviour [144] The Complainant and the Commission are also seeking the maximum award available under s. 53(3) of the Act. This provision states that a person who has wilfully or recklessly engaged in the discriminatory practice may be ordered to pay to the victim compensation in an amount not exceeding $20,000.\n[145] There is overwhelming evidence of reckless conduct on the part of the Respondent. He had received sexual harassment sensitization training several times and was consequently in a position to fully comprehend that his behaviour was unacceptable, not to mention illegal. Yet, he took the unreasonable risk of engaging in unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature towards the Complainant. Moreover, the Respondent continued harassing the Complainant in the face of repeated requests and instructions that he stop.\n[146] I am satisfied, therefore, that the Respondent\u2019s discriminatory practice was not only reckless but wilful as well. In these circumstances, the Respondent is ordered to pay to the Complainant the sum of $15,000 in damages, pursuant to s. 53(3).\nE. Interest [147] Interest is payable in respect of all of the monetary awards made in this decision (s. 53(4) of the Act). The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. With respect to the compensation for pain and suffering and for wilful and reckless behaviour, the interest shall run from March 10, 1998, the date when the Respondent sexually harassed the Complainant in his automobile, to the date of payment. In no case shall the interest regarding each of these awards be allowed to exceed the maximum allowable sum of $20,000.[12] Because the expenses related to the Complainant\u2019s change of residence have been incurred at various times, right up to the hearing dates, I order that the interest arising from these expenses shall run from the date of this decision to the date of payment.\nF. Sexual Harassment Training and Counselling [148] The Respondent has attended several sexual harassment awareness courses, most of which occurred prior or during the period when he harassed the Complainant. His most recent course was taken in compliance with the reprimands issued by Canada Post after Ms. Hine filed her investigation report. The Commission submits that despite this training, the Respondent never altered his behaviour and continues denying to this day that he ever sexually harassed the Complainant. The Commission points out that the Respondent\u2019s prior sessions were of a relatively short duration, never lasting more than one day. For this reason, the Commission requests that the Respondent be required to attend a series of more intensive and comprehensive training sessions, in accordance with s. 53(2)(a) of the Act.\n[149] I agree that such training is warranted. I therefore order the Respondent to attend a course on sexual harassment that will comprise at least three full-day sessions. The course will be selected by the Commission. The reasonable cost for this training session will be paid by the Respondent.\nG. Retention of Jurisdiction [150] I retain jurisdiction in the event that any dispute arises regarding the quantification or implementation of any of the remedies awarded in this decision.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Grant Sinclair Date: June 17 2003 Citation: 2003 CHRT 22\nTable of Contents\nI. Facts\nII. Decision\nIII. Interest\nIV. Order\nI. Facts [1] Keith Dawson, the Complainant in this matter, filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated February 27, 1996. In his complaint against the Eskasoni Indian Band, Mr. Dawson alleges that the Chief and Council of Eskasoni discriminated against him because of his race and colour (white) contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, by denying him social assistance benefits because he is a non-Band member.\n[2] At the beginning of the hearing, the parties filed an Agreed Statement of Facts with the Tribunal. According to this Statement, the following facts are agreed to:\nMr. Dawson is a white male, is not an Eskasoni Band member and is not eligible for membership because he is not a status Indian; Mr. Dawson lives on the Eskasoni Reserve with his wife, who is a status Indian and a Band member. He is entitled to live on the Reserve because of his marriage to his Indian spouse; Eskasoni administers a social assistance plan for eligible persons living on the Reserve under a DIAND\/First Nations Funding Agreement covering the fiscal years 2003\/2004 to 2007\/2008. Similar funding agreements have been in place since 1987; Because he lives on the Reserve, Mr. Dawson is not eligible for provincial social assistance benefits; In 1988, Mr. Dawson applied for social assistance benefits from Eskasoni. He was denied such benefits, because, as a matter of policy, Eskasoni does not give social assistance benefits to non-Band members; In 1996, Mr. Dawson again applied to Eskasoni for social assistance benefits following this Tribunal\u2019s decision in MacNutt v. Shubenacadie Band, [1995] C.H.R.D. No. 14, in which the Tribunal, dealing with a similar fact situation, decided that the denial of social assistance benefits to a non-status person contravened section 5 of the Act; Again Eskasoni denied his request because he was a non-Band member.\n[3] At the hearing, Eskasoni conceded that Mr. Dawson is entitled to receive social assistance benefits. Eskasoni agreed to pay Mr. Dawson a lump sum, being the total amount of the social assistance benefits that he is entitled to from July 1998 to June 2, 2003, the date of the hearing, minus $100 per month, for each month during this period, which Mr. Dawson estimated to be his earnings from various part time jobs. Eskasoni agreed to pay interest on this net amount for the same time period. Eskasoni also agreed to place Mr. Dawson on its list of those persons on the Reserve who receive social assistance benefits as of June 2, 2003.\n[4] Finally, Eskasoni agreed to cease and desist its discriminatory practice of denying social assistance benefits to otherwise eligible persons, but who are non-Band members.\nII. Decision [5] The Commission and Mr. Dawson also asked, by way of remedy, that he be awarded $20,000 for pain and suffering under section 53(2)(e) of the Act and $20,000 for special compensation under section 53(3) of the Act, because of Eskasoni\u2019s alleged wilful and reckless actions.\n[6] Prior to June 30, 1998, the maximum amount that the Tribunal could award for reckless or wilful conduct or hurt feelings or loss of self-respect was $5,000. With the Bill S-5 amendments, effective June 30, 1998, the Act now provides a maximum of $20,000 for pain and suffering and $20,000 for reckless or wilful behaviour.\n[7] Mr. Dawson filed his complaint in 1996. Nonetheless the Commission argues that the Bill S-5 amendments apply. Its submission is simply that the denial of the benefits by Eskasoni is a continuing and ongoing discriminatory practice. No other basis or legal authority was offered beyond this.\n[8] I can not accept this argument. To do so would result in every legislative amendment automatically having retrospective effect so long as a complainant continues to suffer from a long past event. The analysis must be and is much more complex, as demonstrated in the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Nkwazi v. Correctional Service of Canada, (2001) 39 C.H.R.R. D\/237, at D\/288-290. In this case, for the reasons set out therein, the Tribunal concluded that s. 53 as amended in 1998 has prospective application only. I agree with the Tribunal\u2019s reasons and in the result, the maximum that this Tribunal can award Mr. Dawson in this case is $5,000 for special compensation.\n[9] Mr. Dawson testified that in the period 1988 to 1996, he had only been able to find occasional part-time work. When his employment insurance benefits ran out, because he was not eligible for provincial social assistance, he applied to Eskasoni. In his evidence he said the denial by Eskasoni was devastating. He believed that he had been paying into the system for twenty years when he was working and he did not mind doing so because some day he may need social assistance. But when that day came, he was denied the benefits. In his view he was denied the same basic rights as the rest of the citizens of this country are entitled to \u2013 why? Mr. Dawson expressed these same sentiments in a letter he wrote to the Commission on October 8, 1996.\n[10] According to the DIAND\/First Nations Funding Agreement, in particular, Chapter 3, paragraph 3.01(e) of the Native Community Services Guidelines, Policies and Procedures, Mr. Dawson was clearly entitled to receive social assistance benefits from Eskasoni. Yet in 1988, the Band refused his application because he was a non-Band member. In 1996, even after the Tribunal had decided in the MacNutt case, that such a policy or practice was discriminatory, Eskasoni still refused him social assistance benefits.\n[11] Eskasoni argued that it was awaiting the final appeal decision in MacNutt before reconsidering its policy of not giving social assistance to non-Band members. In my opinion, Eskasoni acted recklessly in continuing its practice in the face of a clear legal determination that such a practice was discriminatory. On the basis of all of the above evidence, I conclude that Mr. Dawson should be awarded the maximum of $5,000 under section 53(3) of the pre-amendment Act.\nIII. Interest [12] There remains only the question of the rate of interest payable on the net amount of the social assistance benefits. The Commission argued that interest should be payable at the Canada Savings Bond rate, in this case at the rate of 5%. Eskasoni argued for an interest rate of 2%. Neither party offered any evidence in support of their position.\n[13] Under Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure, unless ordered otherwise, interest is to be calculated according to the formula set out in the Rule. No submissions were made by either party that this Tribunal should order otherwise. Accordingly, interest shall be payable by Eskasoni on the net amount of social assistance payments to which Mr. Dawson is entitled to from July 1988 to June 2, 2003, in accordance with Rule 9(12).\nIV. Order [14] The Tribunal orders that:\nEskasoni cease and desist its discriminatory practice of denying social assistance benefits to otherwise eligible persons who reside on the Eskasoni Reserve, because they are non-Band members; Eskasoni pay to Mr. Dawson a lump sum amount being the social assistance benefits he was entitled to from July 1988 to June 2, 2003, less $100 per month for each month during that period, plus interest on this amount from July 1988 to June 2, 2003. Interest is to be calculated in accordance with Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Interim Rules of Procedure; Eskasoni is to place Mr. Dawson on its list of social assistance recipients as of June 2, 2003, so that he will receive the social assistance payments that he is entitled to from that date forward; Eskasoni shall pay Mr. Dawson the sum of $5,000 as special compensation pursuant to s. 53(3) of the pre-amendment Act. No interest is payable on this award.\n[15] If the parties are unable to agree as to the amount of the social assistance benefits payable to Mr. Dawson or the amount of interest thereon, they shall so advise the Tribunal no later than July 15, 2003. I retain jurisdiction to deal with these matters in the event of a failure of the parties to so agree.\nSigned by\nJ.

She asked the Tribunal to determine who would have to assume the costs related to re-establishing the pension plan to which she would have been entitled had she not been terminated.\n[4] The Canadian Human Rights Commission and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation were notified of Suzanne Larente\u2019s application.\n[5] The Canadian Human Rights Commission informed the Tribunal that it had no submissions to make in relation to Suzanne Larente\u2019s application.\n[6] The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation filed written submissions and applicable case law with the Tribunal. It argued that Suzanne Larente\u2019s application could not be heard because the decision and the orders made by the Tribunal on April 23, 2003, were final. The Tribunal no longer had jurisdiction; it was functus officio. Accordingly, it could not hear Suzanne Larente\u2019s application.\n[7] The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s submissions were sent to Suzanne Larente, who communicated her comments and arguments.\n[8] The Tribunal has the parties\u2019 arguments. In its opinion, it is sufficiently informed to take a position without it being necessary to hear the parties.\n[9] In her application, the complainant Suzanne Larente is seeking a decision by the Tribunal regarding the steps to follow to enforce the decision made by it. The Tribunal must therefore determine if it has jurisdiction to reopen the matter and hear additional evidence in order to set out the enforcement of its decision.\n[10] In the decision that was made, the Tribunal did not reserve any jurisdiction in regard to the enforcement of the order to restore the pension plan to which Suzanne Larente would have been entitled had she not been terminated.\n[11] Accordingly, as soon as the Tribunal made its decision, that decision was final. The Tribunal thereby lost all jurisdiction. It became bound by the functus officio rule. The legal term functus officio, according to Black's Law Dictionary, is defined as follows:\nHaving fulfilled the function, discharged the office, or accomplished the purpose, and therefore of no further force or authority.\n[12] Further, section 57 of the Canadian Human Rights Act clearly provides that the enforcement of orders by the Tribunal is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.\n[13] Considering the functus officio rule and the case law on that subject, the Tribunal finds that the functus officio rule is applicable to this application and that it does not have jurisdiction to determine who must assume the costs related to re-establishing the pension plan to which Suzanne Larente would have been entitled had she not been terminated.\nConclusion [14] Accordingly, the application is dismissed.\nSigned by\nRoger Doyon Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario June 26, 2003\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T638\/2601\nStyle of Cause: Suzanne Larente v.

Retention of Jurisdiction\n[1] It is alleged in the present complaint that Mireille Des Rosiers was harassed by Jean Barbe, her supervisor at Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), on the basis of several prohibited grounds of discrimination, namely her sex (female), her race (Black) and her national or ethnic origin (Haitian), in violation of s. 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act).(1)\nI. THE PARTIES TO THE COMPLAINT [2] On April 1, 2003, about five weeks before the hearing was scheduled to begin, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) notified the Tribunal that it was officially withdrawing as a party. The Commission was consequently not present at the hearing and no representations were made on its behalf.\n[3] On April 15, 2003, during a conference call that I conducted, Mr. Barbe's lawyer, Me Cl\u00e9ment Groleau, declared that he no longer had a mandate to represent his client. Me Groleau stated that Mr. Barbe was in the process of filing for bankruptcy. This was later confirmed by Mr. Barbe himself, during a subsequent conference call. Mr. Barbe also stated that he was not going to be in attendance at the hearing into the complaint. Indeed, neither Mr. Barbe nor anyone representing him appeared at the hearing, which was conducted over the course of three days at the Federal Court of Canada Building in Montreal. According to the Tribunal record, Mr. Barbe resides in Montreal and he was duly served with several notices advising him of the date, time and place of the hearing.\n[4] On the first day of the hearing, a motion was presented to add Ms. Des Rosiers as a party, and more significantly, as a co-complainant. The complaint form, which was filed on March 8, 1999, was not signed by Ms. Des Rosiers, but rather by a representative of a non-profit support group for victims of harassment called Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec Inc., (Groupe d'aide). Ms. Des Rosiers had sought the assistance of Groupe d'aide after the alleged incidents of discrimination had taken place. She and a representative of Groupe d'aide, Linda Smith, went to the offices of the Commission together, to file the complaint. Ms. Smith explained at the hearing that the Commission employee who received the complaint recommended that a representative of Groupe d'aide sign the document instead of Ms. Des Rosiers.\n[5] The motion to add Ms. Des Rosiers as a party was therefore formally made by Groupe d'aide. For the reasons that I read into the official record, I granted Groupe d'aide's motion to add Ms. Des Rosiers to the case. I noted that under s. 40(1) of the Act, a group of individuals having reasonable grounds to believe that someone has engaged in a discriminatory practice may file a complaint, whether or not the victim is a member of that group. Section 53(2) specifies that the Tribunal can order remedies for the benefit of the victim of the discriminatory practice, not necessarily the complainant. Thus, it appears that it is not essential for the victim to be the complainant, in order to gain redress under the Act.\n[6] However, I also noted that s. 48.9(2)(b) of the Act empowers the Tribunal to make rules governing the addition of parties and interested persons to the proceedings. In Desormeaux v. OC Transpo(2), it was held that this provision appears to contemplate the possibility of the Tribunal authorizing the addition of a party, even as a complainant. This power should be exercised with some caution, particularly if any unfairness to any of the other parties would arise as a result. In the present case, since Mr. Barbe did not appear at the hearing, he did not tender a formal objection to the addition of Ms. Des Rosiers as a party. In my ruling, I pointed out that although the complaint was signed by Groupe d'aide, it referred exclusively to events experienced by Ms. Des Rosiers while working with Mr. Barbe. The addition of Ms. Des Rosiers to the case would therefore not raise any new issues or facts of which Mr. Barbe was not already aware. Taking all of these considerations into account, I concluded that no issue of fairness would arise if Ms. Des Rosiers were allowed to join the case as a complainant at this stage and I therefore granted the motion.\n[7] Due to the withdrawal of the Commission and the absence of Mr. Barbe, the hearing was conducted solely in the presence of two parties, Ms. Des Rosiers and Groupe d'aide, represented by Ms. Smith. Neither of these parties was assisted by legal counsel at the hearing. The facts recounted in this decision are therefore based exclusively on the evidence that was led by the Complainants.\nII. FACTS [8] Ms. Des Rosiers is a Black woman of Haitian origin who was raised in Montreal. She resided in California for several years, during which time she earned a degree in marketing from the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) and worked in the radio-television industry, with American Broadcasting Radio. When she returned to Montreal, she decided to pursue her career within the same field and gained employment with a local private radio station. In 1996, her manager at that station informed her of a project that had been put in place at the CBC for the integration of members of minority groups into its workforce.\n[9] The project, which was subsidized by the Federal Government's Department of Canadian Heritage, provided funding for the hiring of trainees and the payment of their salaries over an initial period of three months. If the employer decided to continue to employ the trainees after the end of this period, the program would continue to fund a portion of their salaries for several more months. Ms. Micheline L\u00e9onard was in charge of the project when Ms. Des Rosiers applied for a trainee position in late 1996. Ms. L\u00e9onard testified at the hearing that the project's coordinators wanted to avoid the development of an impression amongst other CBC employees that these trainees were only hired because of their minority status. Consequently, trainees were required to pass a complicated and intensive series of tests and interviews before being hired.\n[10] Ms. Des Rosiers confirmed in her testimony that she underwent this process. She recalls that she was one of about eight persons to be selected from amongst the three hundred or so applicants. She believes that her extensive knowledge with respect to the artistic milieu, based on her previous broadcasting experience, was an important factor in the decision to hire her for the television show to which she was assigned. The television program in question was entitled La vie d'artiste. Its broadcasts consisted principally of interviews and reports regarding personalities from the artistic world, including actors, playwrights and poets.\n[11] Ms. Des Rosiers was employed originally as a researcher, but before long, she was assigned researcher-producer duties and she eventually made on-camera appearances. The program was put together by a team of individuals. Mr. Barbe, who was the editor in chief of the show, was the team's supervisor.\n[12] In her testimony, Ms. Des Rosiers described the various events of alleged harassment that occurred during the course of her employment under Mr. Barbe's supervision. I have set out these events according to the months in which she testified that they occurred.\nA. December 1996 [13] At Ms. Des Rosiers's first meeting with Mr. Barbe, he mentioned several times that the other researcher on the team, Johanne Comte, was his spouse. Because of the emphasis that Mr. Barbe appeared to be placing on this point, Ms. Des Rosiers felt compelled to comment that Ms. Comte must nonetheless have been well qualified in order to have acquired the job. Ms. Des Rosiers was surprised to hear Mr. Barbe reply, I don't care about her qualifications, it's her ass that interests me. (Je m'en fous de ses comp\u00e9tences, c'est son cul qui m'int\u00e9resse.)\n[14] Later that month, Jocelyn Barnab\u00e9, who was Mr. Barbe's supervisor and one of the producers of the television show, asked a small favour of Ms. Des Rosiers and she agreed. Mr. Barbe approached Ms. Des Rosiers afterwards and said that she should have been more aggressive and not agreed to Mr. Barnab\u00e9's request. Mr. Barbe added that some of his former girlfriends were Black. He then advised her that in order to succeed, she should screw around. (Tu devrais baiser.)\nB. January 1997 [15] Mr. Barbe mentioned at a meeting, attended by Ms. Des Rosiers, that he was looking for someone to look after his dog while he was out of town. When someone at the table asked if Ms. Des Rosiers would be interested, Mr. Barbe interjected, She should get along with Charlotte [the dog], she is black like her. (Elle devrait s'entendre avec Charlotte, elle est noire comme elle.)\n[16] In the same month of January 1997, the production team was having a meal at the Chez Miville restaurant, which is located within the CBC's building in Montreal, the Maison de Radio-Canada. Ms. Des Rosiers mentioned at the table that she knew the former director of the Culture and Variety division at the CBC. Upon hearing this, Mr. Barbe commented that she must have acquired the job through this connection, adding, Was it good? (Est-ce que c'\u00e9tait bon?). Ms. Des Rosiers interprets this statement as implying that she had sexual relations with the former director.\nC. February 1997 [17] Ms. Des Rosiers had by now collaborated on several features, yet she noticed that her name had not appeared on any of the show's closing credits. At about the same time, she informed Mr. Barbe that she wished to produce a report on the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. He objected, stating that a story on this topic should only be done by a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. (La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, c'est les Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois qui devraient faire \u00e7a.)\n[18] In the same month, Ms. Des Rosiers co-produced a report on the works of playwright Michel Tremblay, focussing on the fact that his plays had been translated into 127 languages. To this end, Ms. Des Rosiers incorporated into the piece several interviews with foreign-language commentators (Italian, Romanian, Japanese and Haitian-Cr\u00e9ole). The Haitian commentator, who happens to be Ms. Des Rosier's brother, is an award-winning writer and was the Vice-President of the Union des \u00e9crivains et \u00e9crivaines qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. During a pre-screening of the report, Mr. Barbe remarked out loud that he was against the usage of the Haitian. (Je suis contre l'Ha\u00eftien dans le reportage.)\nD. March 1997 [19] Ms. Des Rosiers recalls that Mr. Barbe and Ms. Comte walked into her office together one day. Ms. Comte was carrying a photograph of a well-known Black humorist of Haitian origin, Anthony Kavanaugh. Ms. Comte pinned the photo on Ms. Des Rosiers's bulletin board and said, Here's your new boyfriend. (Voici ton nouveau chum.) Mr. Barbe then added, You [Ms. Des Rosiers] should mate with him. (Tu devrais t'accoupler avec.) Mr. Barbe and Ms. Comte made these comments even though Ms. Des Rosiers was married.\n[20] Ms. Des Rosiers also remembers walking into Mr. Barnab\u00e9's office one day and finding him standing next to Mr. Barbe and Ms. Comte. There were several photographs on the table in front of them and when Ms. Des Rosiers arrived, Ms. Comte picked one up and gave it to her. The photo was of Mr. Barbe in the nude. Ms. Des Rosiers does not know why this photo was shown to her other than to make her feel uncomfortable.\nE. April 1997 [21] Mr. Barbe remarked to one of the office's secretaries that he noticed she had changed her hair colour. He then turned to address Ms. Des Rosiers and told her that she appeared more white than usual. (Il a dit que je paraissais plus blanche que d'habitude.)\nF. May 1997 [22] At a party that was held at the end of the show's season, Mr. Barbe told Ms. Des Rosiers that she should get up and dance since it was in your blood. (... que c'\u00e9tait dans votre sang). He then added, while grabbing his crotch, If you dance, you'll get a nice gift. (Si tu danses, tu auras un beau cadeau.) He also commented on her breasts, asking her if they were real (v\u00e9ritables). Ms. Des Rosiers testified that he made similar comments about her breasts throughout the period that she worked for him.\nG. August 1997 [23] At a production team meeting, Mr. Barbe remarked, I've hired rejects, Arabs, Blacks, Jews. All that's left for me are the handicapped (J'ai engag\u00e9 des laiss\u00e9s-pour-compte, des Arabes, des Noirs, des Juifs. Il me reste juste des handicap\u00e9s.) He pointed out that hiring minorities was beneficial (payant) because of the subsidies that were provided. Ms. Comte contributed to the conversation by stating that she was opposed to these advantages that we are giving to minorities. (Moi, je suis contre ces avantages qu'on donne aux minorit\u00e9s.) Ms. Des Rosiers testified that she was shocked to hear these comments, especially since she herself was hired through an employment equity program. She nonetheless restrained herself from making any comment at that time.\nH. September 1997 [24] Ms. Des Rosiers proposed doing a story about the French author, Marcel Proust. Although the idea was well received by Mr. Barnab\u00e9, Mr. Barbe derided her suggestion, stating that she should be doing stories about Cr\u00e9ole culture. On this occasion, she turned to him and said, Leave me alone (l\u00e2che-moi). She testified that for as long as she worked with Mr. Barbe, he used to repeatedly blurt out to her, Do something on Cr\u00e9ole. (Fais donc quelque chose sur le cr\u00e9ole.)\nI. October 1997 [25] During a production meeting, another staff member proposed that a report be done about African music. The discussion then shifted to finding an appropriate musician to interview. Mr. Barbe interjected by turning to Ms. Des Rosiers and saying, She must know that African that you are looking for, all the Blacks know each other (Elle devrait conna\u00eetre cet Africain que tu cherches, tous les Noirs se connaissent). Ms. Des Rosiers pretended not to hear him but, after being repeatedly baited so as to elicit a reply, she retorted that she wanted them to stop this discussion and move on to something else.\nJ. November 1997 [26] On November 24, 1997, Ms. Des Rosiers met an acquaintance, Ms. Micha\u00eblle Jean, near the main entrance to the Maison de Radio-Canada. At that time, Ms. Jean, who is also Black, was the anchorperson for the newscasts of the CBC's French language all-news network, the Reseau de l'information (RDI). Ms. Des Rosiers was explaining some of the incidents of alleged harassment that she was experiencing at work when, by coincidence, Mr. Barbe, Mr. Barnab\u00e9 and another male CBC employee passed by. Ms. Des Rosiers introduced the three men to Ms. Jean, after which Mr. Barbe said, What's this? A Black women's meeting, the Blacks are getting together? (Mais c'est quoi? C'est une r\u00e9union de femmes noires? C'est quoi, l\u00e0, les Noires se r\u00e9unissent?)\n[27] He then said that he had seen Ms. Jean in the studio where the famous Black fashion model, Iman, had recently been interviewed; adding that he assumed Ms. Jean was there because she also was Black. Ms. Jean testified at the hearing and confirmed that these comments were indeed made. She specifically recalls how bizarre and strange she found Mr. Barbe's persistent remarks about skin colour. Ms. Des Rosiers stated in her testimony that Mr. Barbe went on to compare the women's skin colours and wonder out loud which one had a lighter complexion.\n[28] When Ms. Des Rosiers returned to her office, about fifteen minutes after this chance encounter ended, she found Mr. Barbe seated in her office chair, leaning back with his feet on her desk. As she walked in, he said, So, you're hanging around Blacks now, eh? (Tu te tiens avec les Noirs maintentant, hein?)\nK. February 1998 [29] The second week of that month had been designated as Black History Week, an event that had been well publicized within the CBC. Posters to celebrate the occasion had been placed throughout the workplace. On the Monday of that week, as she was seated in her office, she noticed Mr. Barbe and several staff members dancing, singing and laughing outside her door. Mr. Barbe was wearing a Rastafarian-style wig on his head with a Jamaican-style hat on top. He had draped a Jamaican flag over his shoulders and had begun prancing around the work area, moving his hands towards his armpits, acting as if he were a monkey. Later on, the wig was placed on a pole to which a tattered T-shirt was attached, and Mr. Barbe and the other employees paraded around with this object in their hands.\n[30] This activity was repeated every day that week. Ms. Des Rosiers testified that she felt so humiliated that she made arrangements to work outside the office on the Friday, just so she could avoid her colleagues. Just about every member of the staff, even Mr. Barnab\u00e9, participated to varying degrees in this activity. Ms. Des Rosiers points out that she was the only member of a visible minority group to be working on the La vie d'artiste production team.\n[31] About one week later, a staff meeting was conducted at the Chez Miville restaurant. At the end of the meeting, as Ms. Des Rosiers got up from her chair and turned to step away from the table, she accidentally knocked over a glass of water. Mr. Barbe immediately remarked, It's not surprising that she should knock over a glass, with her big African ass (C'est pas \u00e9tonnant qu'elle renverse un verre avec son gros cul d'Africaine.) She gave Mr. Barbe an angry look and continued on her way. Her colleague, Claude Laforest, testified that he heard Mr. Barbe make some comment at that meeting over which everyone at the table laughed, but he could not recall the exact words.\n[32] During another production meeting, which was held on February 28, 1998, the team realized that they needed another report to complete an upcoming show. Ms. Des Rosiers mentioned that she had almost finished a report on Haitians, which had been assigned to her, and she proposed that it could be used to fill in the gap. Mr. Barbe turned to her at this point and said that she should add to her report scenes of sweaty, male Negroes (des m\u00e2les n\u00e8gres en sueur) and that images of sweaty Negroes are always nice (c'est toujours beau des n\u00e8gres en sueur). Ms. Des Rosiers, trying to ignore Mr. Barbe's comments, continued to discuss the report with Mr. Barnab\u00e9. All of a sudden, Mr. Barbe leaned forward towards her and said, Mireille, shut up, shut up. (Mireille, ta gueule, ta gueule.)\nL. April 1998 [33] During a production meeting, a young female staff member mentioned how fearful she was about visiting her dentist. Everyone around the table soon began to discuss their own painful experiences with doctors. Mr. Barbe remarked that one of his worst experiences was having his penis examined by a doctor to determine whether he had caught some disease. After telling his story, Mr. Barbe turned towards Ms. Des Rosiers and said the disease that he may have caught was because of one of your sisters. (\u00c0 cause d'une de tes soeurs.)\nM. Actions Initiated by Ms. Des Rosiers in Response and the Ensuing Consequences [34] Ms. Des Rosiers occasionally discussed some of the above events with Ms. L\u00e9onard, including Mr. Barbe's comment about his dog, his statements about hiring minorities and his remark after the water glass was knocked over. Ms. Des Rosiers testified that she hesitated complaining too emphatically, for fear of being accused by others of over-dramatizing the situation. She pointed out that Mr. Barbe was still her boss and she feared that filing complaints of a formal nature against him would harm her career and thereby add fuel to the fire.\n[35] In February 1998, Ms. Des Rosiers learned that Ms. L\u00e9onard's office had spoken to Mr. Barnab\u00e9 about Mr. Barbe's conduct. Some days later, Ms. Des Rosiers spoke to Mr. Barnab\u00e9 about the situation. He contended that Mr. Barbe's behaviour was neither sexist nor racist and that after all, Mr. Barbe is just an iconoclast. Mr. Barnab\u00e9 also advised Ms. Des Rosiers that if she followed through on her complaints, she would lose her job and be the only one to suffer. In mid-April 1998, Ms. Des Rosiers discussed the matter with the CBC's human resources department but she was given no specific advice at this time other than an assurance that the department would be contacting her again in the future.\n[36] In late April 1998, a meeting, which was arranged by Mr. Barnab\u00e9, took place between Mr. Barbe and Ms. Des Rosiers. Mr. Barbe opened by apologizing to Ms. Des Rosiers. He went on, however, to say, Anyway, 'big African ass' is not an insult, I love big asses. Ms. Des Rosiers did not consider this to be an apology but rather, yet another humiliation.\n[37] She claims that around this time, her work began to be sabotaged. For instance, she would make appointments to interview guests for her reports and the film crew would be deliberately diverted elsewhere, leaving her unable to record the interviews. She also claims that interviews that she was originally assigned to do were redirected to other members of the staff.\n[38] In mid-May 1998, Ms. Des Rosiers met with a representative of the Commission, who informed her that there existed a harassment policy at the CBC. No one had told Ms. Des Rosiers of this before. The Commission advised her to formally notify the employer of her concerns as soon as possible, in order to avoid falling outside the time limits that are set out in the policy. Ms. Des Rosiers therefore sent her letter of complaint to the President of the CBC on May 19, 1998.\n[39] The television program's operations for that season ended in the month of June. Ms. Des Rosiers was informed by the CBC that it was inquiring into her complaint. The CBC's human resources department assured Ms. Des Rosiers that her job was not in jeopardy and that she should return to her office when production for the new season would commence, on August 17, 1998. However, when she walked into her office on that day, she found that all her personal effects had been removed. Mr. Barbe was occupying her office and he stated that it was now his. A short time later, she heard Mr. Barbe and Mr. Barnab\u00e9 speaking to each other in the latter's office. When she approached them to ask what had happened to her things, Mr. Barbe walked away. Mr. Barnab\u00e9 then told her that because she had complained to the CBC President, he no longer wanted to have her in his department. He accompanied Ms. Des Rosiers to the human resources department where another individual reiterated that she was no longer wanted there, and that she had to leave the building immediately or else security would be called.\n[40] In the following days, Ms. Des Rosiers contacted Mr. Barnab\u00e9's supervisor, who initially told her that having filed a complaint, she should have expected such treatment. However, after Ms. Des Rosiers explained that the initial complaint to Mr. Barnab\u00e9 was made by Ms. L\u00e9onard's office, the supervisor's attitude changed and she agreed to help Ms. Des Rosiers find some other employment at the CBC. Unfortunately, Ms. Des Rosiers was only given a single one-month contract and was assigned some occasional freelance work thereafter, until about May 1999. Since she was unable to make a living from this sporadic work, she began seeking other employment, and finally, on October 10, 2000, she was hired by Air Canada's marketing department, where she is employed to this day.\n[41] I indicated earlier in this decision that Groupe d'aide filed the present complaint against Mr. Barbe on March 8, 1999. Apparently, a complaint was also filed against the CBC but it was settled while the matter was still before the Commission. A preliminary question arose, in the months leading up to the hearing of the present complaint, regarding the disclosure to Mr. Barbe of the minutes of that settlement. The question was ruled upon by the Chairperson of the Tribunal on April 2, 2003, (3) as a consequence of which, certain portions of the settlement agreement were ordered to be disclosed. However, this document was never produced at the hearing and I have not viewed it.\nIII. LAW [42] According to s. 14(1)(c) of the Act, it is a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination in matters related to employment. The prohibited grounds of discrimination include sex, race, and national or ethnic origin (s. 3(1)). Section 14(2) specifies that sexual harassment is deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground.\n[43] The Supreme Court of Canada held in Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Inc., (4) that sexual harassment can be broadly defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of harassment. The Court noted that sexual harassment in the workplace attacks the dignity and self-respect of the victim, both as an employee and as a human being. The analytical framework for assessing claims of sexual harassment has been held to be equally applicable where the harassment is related to another prohibited ground, such as race and national or ethnic origin.(5)\n[44] In order for a complaint of harassment to be substantiated, the following factors are to be considered:(6)\nThe harasser's conduct must somehow be shown to be of a nature that is related to the alleged ground of discrimination.(7) The harassing conduct, particularly in cases of sexual harassment, may be physical in nature, such as pinching, grabbing, hugging and kissing. Harassment can also be verbal in nature, encompassing conduct such as insults or remarks regarding a person's sex, national or ethnic origin, or race, as well as comments regarding a person's appearance or sexual habits. The Tribunal's determination of whether the conduct is related to one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination should be carried out in accordance with the standard of a reasonable person in the circumstances of the case, keeping in mind the prevailing social norms. The acts that are the subject of the complaint were unwelcome. In other words, one must determine whether the alleged harasser's conduct was desired or solicited. This task can be accomplished by assessing the complainant's reaction at the time of the alleged incidents of harassment, and determining whether she expressly, or by her behaviour, demonstrated that the conduct was unwelcome. A verbal no is not required in all cases and a repetitive failure to respond to a harasser's comments could constitute a signal to him that his conduct is unwelcome. In these cases, the appropriate standard to apply is that of a reasonable person in the circumstances. Ordinarily, harassment requires an element of persistence or repetition, but in certain circumstances, even a single incident may be severe enough to create a hostile environment. The objective reasonable person standard is used to assess this factor as well.\n[45] In the sexual harassment case of Stadnyk v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), the Federal Court of Appeal suggested that where proper expert evidence is before the Tribunal confirming that male-female interaction may be perceived differently by men than by women, then the appropriate standard against which to measure the alleged conduct should be that of a reasonable woman. (8)\nIV. ANALYSIS A. Credibility of the Evidence [46] Without the presence of a responding party at the hearing, Ms. Des Rosiers's evidence was obviously left uncontradicted. Even so, I found her to be a credible witness, who testified in an eloquent and clear manner. I note that in her testimony, the dates to which Ms. Des Rosiers attributed a handful of events differed from those set out in the written complaint that was prepared in March 1999. For instance, according to the complaint form, Mr. Barbe's remark regarding his dog, Charlotte, occurred in December 1997 and not January 1997. Similarly, his comment about how Ms. Des Rosiers appeared more white than usual is indicated as having occurred in October 1997, as opposed to April 1997. I do not perceive these discrepancies as a weakness in her testimony. To the contrary, they serve to demonstrate that instead of blindly restating what was written on the complaint form, Ms. Des Rosiers testified on the basis of her actual memory of the incidents. That she may have occasionally misstated, during her testimony, the month or year of a particular event, is not of any real significance. I also note that the witnesses who were called to testify by Ms. Des Rosiers and Groupe d'aide said that they had not discussed the content of their testimony with the complainants prior to being called to the witness stand, and that they testified based on their independent recollections of the facts and corroborated Ms. Des Rosiers's evidence to a certain extent.\nB. Was the Impugned Conduct Related to Sex, Race, or National or Ethnic Origin? [47] Ms. Des Rosiers claims Mr. Barbe's impugned conduct, as described in her evidence, relates to at least one, if not more, of the proscribed grounds of discrimination under the Act.\n[48] It is clear from all of the evidence that a portion of Mr. Barbe's alleged harassing behaviour was sexual in nature, encompassing such things as his gesture towards his crotch at the May 1997 office party, his repeated comments about Ms. Des Rosiers's breasts, his advice that she should screw around and his implication that she got her job because she slept with an executive of the CBC.\n[49] However, Mr. Barbe's harassment was not just sexual in nature. It also extended to matters related to Ms. Des Rosiers's race and origin. His offensive remarks included making comparisons between Ms. Des Rosiers's skin colour and that of his dog, stating that dancing was in her blood, and making racial comments about her physical features. He made a point of blurting out, in her presence, derogatory racial comments against Africans and Blacks. His conduct revealed distaste on his part for all things pertaining to her Haitian background. His insistence that she report on Cr\u00e9ole culture was made in a condescending fashion, as if to suggest that because of her ethnic background she was not worthy or capable enough to comment upon mainstream Quebec or Francophone culture. Mr. Barbe's contemptuous and demeaning behaviour with respect to the Rastafarian wig was strikingly racial in nature and a gross insult to all Black persons, be they of Jamaican, Haitian or any other origin.\n[50] I am therefore satisfied that the nature of Mr. Barbe's impugned conduct was at times either sexual, racial, or related to Ms. Des Rosiers's national or ethnic origin.\nC. Was Mr. Barbe's Conduct Welcome? [51] It is clear from Ms. Des Rosiers's evidence that she did not desire nor solicit Mr. Barbe's alleged discriminatory conduct. On several occasions, she openly demonstrated to him that she was offended by his comments. Thus, at one point, she became so fed up with his incessant remarks that she should prepare a report about Cr\u00e9ole, that she replied in a forceful manner, Leave me alone! (L\u00e2che-moi!). Similarly, when Mr. Barbe asked Ms. Des Rosiers whether she had begun hanging around with Blacks, following her meeting with Micha\u00eblle Jean, Ms. Des Rosiers angrily retorted, Excuse me! (Pardon!).\n[52] In general, however, Ms. Des Rosiers did not respond outwardly to Mr. Barbe's comments, but rather pretended to ignore them. I accept her explanation that Mr. Barbe was, after all, her boss and she feared the consequences that a confrontation with him would have on her career, particularly given that she was merely a trainee. It was for this reason that she chose to address the problem through the back channels, so to speak, by expressing her concerns to Mr. Barnab\u00e9 and Ms. L\u00e9onard, in the hope that these individuals were better placed to convey the message to Mr. Barbe. For instance, she complained to Mr. Barnab\u00e9 about Mr. Barbe's remark that she had no business doing a report on the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. Unfortunately, Mr. Barnab\u00e9 was unwilling to intervene and, in fact, became Mr. Barbe's apologist, taking the position that Mr. Barbe was not really racist or sexist, just an iconoclast. In any event, Ms. Des Rosiers eventually realized that she could hardly count on Mr. Barnab\u00e9's understanding, considering his participation in the masquerade, as she described it, involving the Rastafarian wig.\n[53] Besides, it is unreasonable for Mr. Barbe to have ever considered his behaviour towards Ms. Des Rosiers as welcome. How could any person reasonably conclude that Ms. Des Rosiers, a Black woman of Haitian descent, would welcome his masquerade, his crude gestures with his crotch, his repeated remarks about her breasts, his comparison between her and his dog, and his numerous other aspersions against Blacks and Haitians. To do so would be ludicrous.\n[54] I am therefore satisfied that in the circumstances, Ms. Des Rosiers's response to this conduct was reasonable and that consequently, Mr. Barbe's behaviour was not welcome.\nD. Was the Impugned Conduct Serious Enough to Create a Hostile Environment? [55] Mr. Barbe's discriminatory conduct began as early as his first meeting with Ms. Des Rosiers, when he made the sexually offensive remark that he was only interested in her colleague's ass, and extended over the entire period that she worked on the La vie d'artiste program. Some particular aspects of his conduct were very serious, notably his weeklong masquerade with the Rastafarian wig. I find that this act alone was of such gravity that one could reasonably conclude that Ms. Des Rosiers was working within a hostile environment. When combined with the myriad of other offensive comments and acts engaged in by Mr. Barbe, touching on numerous facets of Ms. Des Rosiers's identity (her race, her gender and her national\/ethnic origin) as well as her dignity as a person, there can be no doubt that her workplace environment had been poisoned.\n[56] For all these reasons, therefore, I find that Mr. Barbe harassed Ms. Des Rosiers on the basis of all three prohibited grounds referred to in the complaint: race, sex and national\/ethnic origin.\nV. REMEDY A. Lost Wages [57] Ms. Des Rosiers is seeking compensation for the wages that she lost due to the non-renewal of her La vie d'artiste employment contract (s. 53(2)(c) of the Act). Although it was Mr. Barnab\u00e9 who informed her, on August 17, 1998, that she would not be rehired for the 1998-99 season, Ms. Des Rosiers contends, based on circumstantial evidence, that Mr. Barbe had a hand in this decision. She points out that when she returned to her office on August 17th, Mr. Barbe had occupied it and said it was now his. She also recalls having been told by Mr. Barnab\u00e9, on an earlier occasion when she was assigned additional work on a couple of other television programs, that it was Mr. Barbe who had decided to provide her this opportunity. Finally, she claims that the person who replaced her on the La vie d'artiste program was a very close acquaintance of Mr. Barbe. Drawing on these facts, she concludes that Mr. Barbe must have been involved in the decision not to renew her contract.\n[58] It may in fact be that Mr. Barbe did not want Ms. Des Rosiers to return to the show and it is even possible that he expressed this opinion to Mr. Barnab\u00e9. Nonetheless, on the evidence before me, the decision to refuse her renewal was Mr. Barnab\u00e9's, or possibly that of the CBC's human resources department, but certainly not Mr. Barbe's. It is noteworthy that the human resources department representative who advised Ms. Des Rosiers to leave the building on August 17, 1998, as well as Mr. Barnab\u00e9, both made it clear that they themselves were upset with the filing of the complaint letter with the CBC President. I am unconvinced that the decision not to renew can be ascribed, even in part, to Mr. Barbe.\n[59] Yet, there still remains one other related issue. Although Mr. Barbe was not involved in the decision not to hire back Ms. Des Rosiers, can the non-renewal nevertheless be indirectly linked to his discriminatory conduct? Had it not been for Mr. Barbe's harassment, Ms. Des Rosiers would not have complained and sent a letter to the CBC President. Mr. Barnab\u00e9, in turn, told Ms. Des Rosiers that she was dismissed from the show because she sent the letter.\n[60] A similar issue came before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in Nkwazi v. Correctional Service of Canada (No. 4). (9) The complainant in that case, claiming that her manager had harassed her, complained to higher management, whose reaction, in turn, was to retaliate against the complainant and not renew her casual contract. The Tribunal came to the following conclusion(10):\nIn cases of discrimination, the goal of compensation is to make the victim whole, subject to principles of foreseeability, remoteness and mitigation. In this case, I am satisfied that there is a causal connection between the original discriminatory practices and the loss of Ms. Nkwazi's job: had Ms. Neufeld not treated Ms. Nkwazi in a discriminatory fashion, Ms. Nkwazi would not have complained about her to RPC management, and the retaliation would not have occurred. In other words, the damages that result from the non-renewal of Ms. Nkwazi's casual contract are damages flowing from Ms. Neufeld's original breach of the Act, and may be considered from the perspective of remedy.\nWas the decision by Mr. Barnab\u00e9 to refuse the renewal of Ms. Des Rosiers's contract a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Mr. Barbe's harassment? Do the damages arising from the non-renewal flow from Mr. Barbe's breach of s. 14 of the Act? I note that in Nkwazi, the respondent before the Tribunal was the institutional employer, the Correctional Service of Canada, not the individual who actually committed the discriminatory practice against the complainant. As a result, the employer ended up being held liable for the loss of income arising from its decision not to renew the complainant's employment contract.(11)\n[61] Mr. Barbe is not the employer in the present case and I have already determined that the evidence is insufficient to support the contention that he was involved in the non-renewal of Ms. Des Rosiers's contract. In Canada (Attorney-General) v. Green,(12) the Federal Court-Trial Division stated that the proper test for assessing damages includes the notions of remoteness and foreseeability. The Court referred to an excerpt from Mr. Justice Marceau's reasons in Canada (Attorney-General) v. Morgan (13):\nThe idea is always the same: exclude consequences which appear down the chain of causality but are too remote in view of all of the intervening facts. Whatsoever be the source of liability, common sense still applies.\nAccordingly, I find that Ms. Des Rosiers's loss in wages arising from the independent decision of the employer, the CBC, (as expressed through the conduct of the show's producer, Mr. Barnab\u00e9, and perhaps the CBC's human resources representative), to refuse to renew Ms. Des Rosiers's contract for La vie d'artiste, to be too remote from Mr. Barbe's discriminatory conduct. It would strain common sense to hold Mr. Barbe liable for a third party's retaliatory acts, in which I am not convinced he played a part.\n[62] Ms. Des Rosiers is therefore not entitled to damages from Mr. Barbe, for her lost wages.\nB. Expenses [63] Ms. Des Rosiers claims that she should be compensated for certain expenses that she incurred as a result of Mr. Barbe's discriminatory practice (s. 53(2)(c) of the Act).\n[64] The expenses being claimed include the fees for lawyers whom Ms. Des Rosiers consulted in 1998. She acknowledges that these fees are for services relating to the grievance that she sought to file against the CBC, and more specifically, certain difficulties she had convincing her union to file the grievance. As such, these expenses are not related to the present complaint against Mr. Barbe and she is therefore not entitled to their reimbursement.(14)\n[65] Ms. Des Rosiers is also claiming the fees that she paid for consultations with two psychologists, from September 1998 until June 2000. She testified as to the extent that her physical and mental health had deteriorated as a result of Mr. Barbe's harassment. I am satisfied that these professional services were warranted and that they are directly related to Mr. Barbe's discriminatory practice. The total amount of these fees is $1,515.00. Photocopies of the invoices documenting these expenses were not communicated to Mr. Barbe or his counsel prior to the hearing. However, in one of the documents disclosed to Mr. Barbe's counsel by the Commission, in March 2003, it is indicated that the invoices would be forthcoming. In the ensuing weeks, neither Mr. Barbe nor his counsel raised any issue regarding this limited disclosure, with the Tribunal. Obviously, with the respondent side being absent from the hearing, no objection was made to the entry into evidence of these receipts. I note that the sums claimed for these psychologists' consultations are reasonable, apparently averaging $60.00 per visit. Taking all of these factors into account, I am satisfied that Ms. Des Rosiers is entitled to claim these expenses.\n[66] Mr. Barbe is therefore ordered to pay to Ms. Des Rosiers the sum of $1,515.00 in reimbursement of her expenses.\nC. Non-pecuniary Damages [67] Ms. Des Rosiers is claiming compensation, under the current version of the Act, for the pain and suffering that she experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice (s. 53(2)(e)), as well as special compensation because Mr. Barbe wilfully or recklessly engaged in the discriminatory practice (s. 53(3)). The maximum award available under each provision is $20,000.\n[68] Prior to the amendments to the Act that took effect on June 30, 1998, (15) awards to victims for non-pecuniary damages were limited to only $5,000 (s. 53(3) of the older version of the Act). In Nkwazi,(16) the Tribunal held that where the discriminatory conduct occurs prior to that date, the previous limits apply.\n[69] By June 1998, the season's production of La vie d'artiste had ended and Ms. Des Rosiers had no further contact with Mr. Barbe. In the written complaint, the last documented act of harassment is listed as being Mr. Barbe's pseudo-apology during which he claimed that big African ass is not an insult. This event occurred in April 1998. During the month of May, Mr. Barbe was away in Europe and had no contact with Ms. Des Rosiers. In her testimony, Ms. Des Rosiers alleged that some of her work was sabotaged after she formalized her complaints against Mr. Barbe, but these incidents took place in mid-June 1998, at the latest.\n[70] The only event involving Ms. Des Rosiers's experience with Mr. Barbe and the La vie d'artiste team that she alleges to have occurred after June 30, 1998, is the notification of her dismissal, which took place on August 17, 1998. As I already explained earlier in this decision, the non-renewal of Ms. Des Rosiers's contract cannot be linked to Mr. Barbe's discriminatory conduct. Furthermore, he did not harass Ms. Des Rosiers during either of his minor interactions with her on that day (in her office and in Mr. Barnab\u00e9's office). In her testimony, Ms. Des Rosiers did not refer to any other meeting or contact with Mr. Barbe after this date.\n[71] I therefore find that all of Mr. Barbe's discriminatory conduct occurred prior to the June 30, 1998 amendments to the Act. I am bound to apply the provisions of s. 53, as they stood at the time when the discriminatory practices took place. According to the older version of s. 53(3), compensation not exceeding $5,000 may be ordered where a person engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly, or where the victim suffered in respect of feelings or self-respect as a result of the practice.\n[72] I am convinced that Mr. Barbe's discriminatory conduct was reckless and even wilful at times. For instance, his decision to parade around in a Rastafarian wig, in plain view of the only Black staff member, during Black History Week, could only have been done with the intention of humiliating Ms. Des Rosiers. His numerous other vulgar and insulting comments and gestures relating to her race, origin and gender were no less mean-spirited and were engaged in without any consideration of the consequences to her feelings or her well-being.\n[73] I am similarly satisfied that Ms. Des Rosiers suffered deeply in respect of her feelings and her self-respect. She testified that experiencing harassment that simultaneously belittled her sex, her race and her culture heightened her pain and aggravated the effect of the discrimination. These insults were coupled with an underlying suggestion that she was not a real Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise.\n[74] In light of all the circumstances, I order Mr. Barbe to pay to Ms. Des Rosiers the sum of $5,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages, pursuant to the pre-amendment version of s. 53(3).\nD. Donation to Groupe d'aide [75] The Complainants request that Mr. Barbe be ordered to make a donation to Groupe d'aide. Ms. Smith pointed out that Groupe d'aide is a non-profit charitable organization made up of volunteers who assist victims of harassment. The group's assistance to Ms. Des Rosiers and the entire Tribunal process was useful, particularly in light of the withdrawal by the Commission shortly before the start of the hearing.\n[76] The Tribunal's authority to order remedial measures, however, is governed entirely by the Act. None of the remedies enumerated in s. 53 of the Act contemplate the possibility of ordering a respondent to make a payment to anyone other than the victim of his discriminatory conduct. The Complainants' request must therefore be denied.\nE. Interest [77] Interest is payable in respect of the monetary awards made in this decision (s. 53(4) of the Act). However, since I have ordered the maximum award for non-pecuniary damages available under the previous version of the Act, no interest is payable regarding this sum.(17) The interest on the remaining award shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly Series) set by the Bank of Canada, to run from the date of the complaint, March 8, 1999, until final payment.\nF. Letter of Apology [78] The Complainants request that Mr. Barbe be ordered to remit a sincere letter of apology to Ms. Des Rosiers. In light of the recent Federal Court-Trial Division decision in Stevenson v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, (18) to the effect that the Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to make such orders, this request is denied.\nG. Human Rights Sensitization Training [79] Ms. Smith informed the Tribunal that among the services that Groupe d'aide provides to the public is sensitization training with respect to harassment and human rights. The Complainants request that Mr. Barbe be ordered to attend such a training session.\n[80] It is evident from Mr. Barbe's behaviour that he could certainly benefit from such training. Mr. Barbe is therefore ordered to attend a course on harassment and human rights to be organized by Groupe d'aide, in consultation with the Commission, as provided for under s. 53(2)(a) of the Act. The course must be comprised of no less than one and no more than three full-day sessions. The reasonable cost for this training shall be paid by Mr. Barbe.\nH. Retention of Jurisdiction [81] I retain jurisdiction in the event that any dispute arises regarding the quantification or implementation of any of the remedies in this decision.\n\"Original signed by\"\nAthanasios D.

Devine Date: July 3, 2003 Citation: 2003 CHRT 25\n[1] The Respondents' Motion asks for the following relief:\nan Order striking the Complainant's input document dated May 29th, 2003 from the Tribunal Record; an Order requiring the Complainant to provide the Respondents with a proper notice of factual and legal issues (disclosure) containing all of the relevant information and documents in accordance with Section 6 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure; an Order pursuant to Section 53(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act compelling the Complainant to provide to the Respondents copies of the Complainant's Income Tax Returns, Notices of Assessment, and any other documents relevant to the Complainant's income tax situation from years 1989 to 2002; an Order pursuant to Section 50(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act compelling the Complainant to provide the Respondents with a consent document pursuant to Section 241(5) of the Income Tax Act authorizing disclosure by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency to the Respondents of all of the Complainant's taxpayer information with respect to taxation years 1989 to 2002 inclusive; an Order providing that if the Complainant does not comply with Orders (b), (c) and (d) within 14 days following the Tribunal's Order, the Complainant's complaint shall be dismissed; an Order extending the deadline for the production of the Respondents\u2019 notice of factual and legal issues (disclosure) to the date falling 6 weeks after the Complainant has complied with her obligations pursuant to Orders (b), (c) and (d); and such further and other relief as the Tribunal deems just.\n[2] The Tribunal heard the Motion by Teleconference, on June 25th, 2003. Jan Brongers represented the Respondents; Nancy Green represented herself; the Commission, although appropriately served, was not represented on the Motion.\n[3] The Respondents submitted that the disclosure presented to them in Ms. Green\u2019s document characterized as input is vague and confusing; in other words, insufficient to allow the Respondents to make full response. It does not, according to the Respondents, set out with sufficient specificity the material facts, the legal issues and the evidence upon which Ms. Green relies in her request that the Tribunal address the income tax implications of its Decision, dated June 26, 1998. More specifically, she has questioned the calculation of the gross up ordered by the Tribunal in that Decision.\n[4] The Respondents\u2019 Motion is, in essence, a request that Ms. Green start again, and present to them disclosure under headings contemplated in Section 6(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure. Those headings are as follows: Material Facts, Legal Issues, Specific Relief, and Summary of Evidence to be presented by Witnesses.\n[5] The Respondents submitted that, as the Interim Rules of Procedure necessitate summaries of evidence to be heard from witnesses, and, as Ms. Green named, as potential witnesses, Julia Mott, identified as an expert who may be called to give financial advisor information and Brian Saxe, an expert who may be called to give tax accountant information, summaries of their evidence is required.\n[6] The Respondents also submitted that a summary of Ms. Green\u2019s evidence should be included in the disclosure.\n[7] The Respondents argued that they are unable to answer Ms. Green's current vague disclosure. Indeed, because of its confusing nature, the Respondents argued that they are being placed in a position where they must guess what Ms. Green wants and how that can be accomplished. The evidentiary burden, they argued, is being shifted to the Respondents because of the vague and confusing nature of Ms. Green\u2019s disclosure.\n[8] What is specifically needed, argued the Respondents, are copies of Ms. Green\u2019s annual Income Tax Returns, including the Notices of Assessment, from 1989 to 2002, both of which could most easily be received by the Respondents from the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency if the Tribunal ordered that Ms. Green sign a consent document, pursuant to Section 241(5) of the Income Tax Act, authorizing such disclosure.\n[9] Failure to produce more specific disclosure should, according to the Respondents\u2019 argument, result in a dismissal of the Hearing. The Respondents submitted that the current disclosure is so lacking in specificity as to be rendered useless and, as such, should be set aside. Without disclosure, the Hearing cannot proceed fairly, and should be dismissed.\n[10] If the Tribunal makes the Orders requested by the Respondents, the time-frames contemplated in March, 2003 (Ms. Green\u2019s disclosure to be served by May 29th, 2003 and the Respondents\u2019 disclosure to be served by July 11th) should be changed to allow the Respondents six weeks from their receipt of Ms. Green's new disclosure to produce reply disclosure.\n[11] Ms. Green's response to these arguments on this Motion was that, as an unrepresented Complainant, she did her best to create an input document, her disclosure. She indicated that she had been the first witness in this Hearing, giving evidence in October, 2002 and having that evidence cross-examined.\n[12] She has completed her testimony which concerned her reasons for requesting a re-convening of the Tribunal to address the calculation of the gross up presented to her by her employer pursuant to the June, 1998 Decision. She indicated that her tax summaries are part of the Hearing Record, as Exhibits presented when her evidence was given.\n[13] Additionally, Ms. Green indicated that she had followed the March, 2003 request of the Respondents\u2019 Counsel, Mr. Unrau, and had attended at the Office of the Respondents\u2019 employee, Mr. Roger Dart, with her Income Tax Returns, and Notices of Assessment. She submitted that she had remained with Mr. Dart in order that she be immediately available to him to answer any questions he had concerning that tax information, and had offered that he could make copies of the information. According to Ms. Green, that offer was declined.\n[14] Ms. Green submitted that her evidence, and the input document represent her best effort to present her layman\u2019s understanding, or lack thereof, of the income tax implications of the June, 1998 Decision. Ms. Green noted that her concern is that there has been a loss of Registered Retirement Savings Plan contribution room, and consequent tax savings which would have generated interest income.\n[15] Ms. Green argued that it is these income tax implications which should have been addressed when the gross up was calculated. Additionally, Ms. Green submitted that the Respondents\u2019 concern about the income tax implications of the Decision\u2019s interest award might also be addressed during this Hearing.\n[16] The Tribunal agrees that Ms. Green has presented the relief she is seeking during her direct evidence and its cross-examination, and in her input document.\n[17] The issue before the Tribunal is the methodology for the calculation of the gross up\u2019 on the award made in June, 1998 concerning Ms. Green\u2019s original Complaint. What is that methodology? How does it address the income tax implications of the award? More specifically, how does it address the loss of the value of the R R S P contributions which Ms. Green would have had available to her, on an annual basis, had she been receiving the higher annual rate of pay she was awarded? Should the gross up include consideration of the interest award?\n[18] The tax summaries, made exhibits during Ms. Green\u2019s testimony, are part of the Hearing Record. Ms. Green has indicated in her input document what she feels is relevant income tax information, winnowed from the actual documents presented to Roger Dart, the Respondents\u2019 named contact person. This includes her gross income for the years 1989-2000, her taxable income for those years, the R R S P room for those years with the 50% notation, and the calculation concerning lost interest on the R R S P non-contributions.\n[19] The input document is not organized pursuant to Section 6(1) of the Interim Rules of Procedure. This may have been caused by the fact that some of the requirements of that section had already been addressed by Ms. Green\u2019s evidence, including exhibits.\n[20] Additionally, the testimony of the proposed experts, in summary form, is not included. There is no specific calculation of the monetary relief suggested by Ms. Green to represent a more appropriate gross up.\n[21] These latter items, however, will undoubtedly be included in the Experts\u2019 Reports which must be served upon the Respondents, pursuant to Section 6(4) of the Interim Rules of Procedure, ten (10) days before the Hearing dates of August 12-13, 2003.\n[22] The Respondents are correct in their indication to the Tribunal that the input document lacks the organization contemplated by the Interim Rules of Procedure. The Tribunal, however, is not persuaded that, when read in conjunction with the evidence of Ms. Green, it is so lacking in specificity that it ambushes the Respondents as alleged.\n[23] The requirement that Experts' Reports be served ten days before the Hearing may assuage the Respondents' concerns, especially about the need for income tax information for both the Tribunal and for themselves. The experts proposed by Ms. Green - a financial advisor and a tax accountant - will undoubtedly be basing their opinions upon Ms. Green\u2019s tax information. The Respondents will receive those Experts\u2019 Reports and opinions, with the foundations for those opinions, at the appropriate time.\n[24] Of course, as the Respondents argued, the Tribunal can make its final decision based only on what it has before it. How much information she wishes the Tribunal to have in order to make that decision is up to Ms. Green.\n[25] The organization of the materials may not be as the Respondents would wish it to be; the materials may not be as fulsome as the Respondents would like. The materials are not, however, completely lacking in information to address the disclosure requirements of Section 6(1) of the Interim Rules of Procedure. The Reports of Ms. Green\u2019s experts will, hopefully, address the concerns of the Respondents.\n[26] For these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondents\u2019 Motion.\nSigned by\nElizabeth A.G.

CONCLUSION\nVIII. RETENTION OF JURISDICTION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] The complainant, Martin Desrosiers (Desrosiers), alleges that he was discriminated against on the basis of his disability and his family status in that the respondent, the Canada Post Corporation (the Corporation), rejected his candidacy in September 1997 for a CS-03 position of management analyst. The reasons cited by the respondent, according to the complainant, were that he did not meet the physical requirements of the position and that the position called for evening work, which did not fit well with his family obligations.\n[2] The complainant therefore alleges that the respondent discriminated against him, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the Act).\n[3] The parties have also asked the Tribunal, firstly, to deal with the issue of whether there was a discriminatory practice in this case and, if so, whether this discriminatory practice was based on a bona fide occupational requirement within the meaning of the case law and the Act. Secondly, if the complaint proves to be substantiated, the parties have asked that the Tribunal reserve its jurisdiction in order to convene a second hearing to allow the parties to present evidence and arguments on the issue of remedy.\nII. JOINT ADMISSIONS OF FACTS [4] At the start of the hearing, the parties agreed on the following facts:\nDesrosiers has been an employee of the Corporation since May 6, 1987. Since being hired, Desrosiers has held several jobs within the Corporation. On May 22, 1988, he was promoted to full-time supervisor, at level 2. On July 15, 1991, he was appointed to the position of business analyst, an MGT 1.5 management level position. On October 11, 1993, following a lateral transfer, Desrosiers became a communication analyst, a management position (MGT 1.5). In November 1993, the Union of Postal Communications Employees, a component of the Public Service Alliance of Canada, was certified as the bargaining agent for approximately 2,800 employees of the Corporation. Desrosiers was one of those 2,800 employees. On December 15, 1994, Desrosiers' MGT 1.5 position became surplus. On January 12, 1995, Desrosiers suffered a work accident and was absent from work until May 19, 1996. As a result of this work accident, Desrosiers suffered a back injury that affected his functional job skills. On January 25, 1995, the Corporation informed Desrosiers that his position, classified as MGT, was reclassified at the AS-03 level. To facilitate Desrosiers' return to work, the Corporation obtained a musculoskeletal report from the Movement and Analysis Treatment Centre focussing on Desrosiers' functional limitations as assessed on May 17, 1996. On May 19, 1996, Desrosiers returned to his job as it had existed at the time of his work accident in January 1995. On June 10, 1996, Desrosiers took a temporary assignment as a technical development analyst, a position classified at the AS-03 level. On January 27, 1997, Desrosiers accepted a permanent assignment at the Corporation's Institute in an officer position that was classified at the AS-02 level. Even though Desrosiers accepted the AS-02 position on January 27, 1997, he retained his higher employee status as an AS-03. On May 19, 1998, Desrosiers obtained a permanent position as a communications analyst. The position was classified at the AS-03 level. In August 1997, the Corporation posted a competition bearing reference number 97-RID-13 for a management analyst position, classified at the CS-03 level. The deadline for submitting candidacies for competition 97-RID-13 was August 29, 1997. On August 7, 1997, Desrosiers submitted his candidacy for competition 97-RID-13 to Ginette Dinis (Dinis), a human resources officer employed by the Corporation. Dinis was responsible for administering the competition process. Desrosiers' candidacy included a covering letter, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, university diplomas, the results of his second language knowledge examinations and his most recent performance appraisal. On August 8, 1997, Dinis acknowledged receipt of Desrosiers' candidacy by e-mail. She informed Desrosiers that the Corporation [is] currently reviewing your qualifications and your experience relating to this employment opportunity. We will contact you once the review of applications for this position is completed [translation]. On August 8, 1997, Desrosiers and Dinis were in touch by telephone and briefly discussed competition 97-RID-13. During this telephone conversation, Desrosiers and Dinis discussed, among other things, that the position to be awarded under competition 97-RID-13 was one that involved on call duties as well as some travel. During this same telephone conversation, Dinis told Desrosiers that she would send him a copy of the statement of qualifications for competition 97-RID-13. Desrosiers received the statement of qualifications from Dinis in August 1997. As of August 29, 1997, just four candidates had applied for the competition. Of the four, two were screened out and rejected by the Corporation because they did not belong to the bargaining unit within which the coveted position was offered. After these two candidates were screened out, just two candidates remained on the competition roster: Rod Magliocco and Desrosiers. Dinis assigned Michelle Jammes (Jammes) to screen the candidates for the competition while Dinis was on annual leave. As part of her screening process, Jammes inquired at the Corporation's health services about Desrosiers' particular medical and\/or physical restrictions.\nOn September 2, 1997, Jammes asked the Corporation's health services to provide her with information about Desrosiers' particular medical and\/or physical restrictions. According to Jammes:\nI urgently require a list of the above-mentioned employees work restrictions [Martin Desrosiers]. I have been told that he is unable to lift heavy weights however I am not aware of what the medical field deems as heavy or light. I am told that he is unable to sit or stand for long periods of time however I need to know what a long period of time is considered to be, in minutes.\nThe file for this employee is onsite in Huron\/Rideau. I require something in writing from either Dr. Belzile or an occupation health nurse advising me of his restrictions.\nMr. Ramsay is currently staffing a position for which Mr. Desrosiers has applied. I cannot complete the screening process until I know if Mr. Desrosiers is physically fit to be considered for this job. Mr. Ramsay would like the interviews to take place this Friday, Sept. 5.\nCould either Dr. Belzile or Ms Younger please qualify\/quantify the restrictions for our files ?\n[sic]\nStill in the context of her screening of the candidates, Jammes asked the manager responsible for the position represented by competition 97-RID-13 to provide her with a list of the physical activities associated with the vacant position.\nOn September 3, 1997, the consultant working for the Corporation's health services sent Jammes a list of Desrosiers' physical limitations, dated May 21, 1996. This list mentioned the following medical and\/or physical restrictions:\n- Change position every 20-30 minutes; - Stand for short periods of time (5-6- minutes) - Lifting under 18 pounds - Occasional stair climbing - Push\/pull carts with 20 pounds resistance or less.\n[sic]\nOn September 4, 1997, Jammes informed Dinis that she had rejected Desrosiers' candidacy for competition 97-RID-13 due to the fact that he is medically unfit to perform the requirements of this vacant position. On September 5, Rod Magliocco, being the only eligible candidate following the screening process, began the review of qualifications phase as mandated by the hiring process.\nOn September 18, 1997, Dinis informed Desrosiers by e-mail that his candidacy for the competition had been rejected because he did not meet the physical requirements of the position owing to his medical restrictions. Desrosiers filed grievance number 70810-AS-97-079 with his Union, which grievance was subsequently withdrawn from the grievance process by the Union on December 8, 1997.\nRod Magliocco passed the written examination with a grade of 92% and was offered the position under competition 97-RID-13.\nIII. SUPPLEMENTARY FACTS PRESENTED AT THE HEARING [5] As stated in the Joint Admissions of Facts, the Corporation hired Desrosiers on May 6, 1987. On January 12, 1995, he suffered a work accident, a back injury, which forced him to be absent from his job until May 19, 1996. This injury required surgery in August 1995, which was performed by Dr. Max Aebi at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. Prior to this accident and Dr. Aebi's surgery, Desrosiers had had two other surgeries to the lumbar spine, in 1987 and in 1992 (decompression). Also in 1989, he had had surgery to the cervical spine (Clowards). Desrosiers described the last procedure (L4-S1 fusion), in 1995, as follows:\n[Translation]\nThe lumbar fusion consisted first in placing titanium intervertebral spaces between the vertebrae to prevent any further collapse between the vertebrae; so replacing the discs. And then making a kind of cage around the column - I don't know exactly how it's done - and placing titanium rods on both sides with six screws.\nThey then took bone from the hip to place around to calcify everything, so it would be very solid in the future. And the operation was a success, and I have been doing quite well since then.\n[6] In February 1996, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board of Ontario described Desrosiers' disability as permanent and said, among other things, that he was not to lift heavy objects.\n[7] Desrosiers was absent from work until May 19, 1996. As stated in the Joint Admissions of Facts, in order to facilitate his return to work, the Corporation asked him to undergo a musculoskeletal test to determine his functional limitations. Lucie Labenski Blench, a physiotherapist at the Movement Analysis and Treatment Centre, administered this test on May 17, 1996. Mrs. Labenski Blench's mandate, as described in her report, was to assess the functional capacity of Desrosiers in order to determine his office work tolerance and consider his capacity to bend over, sit, stand, and lift heavy objects. She was also to recommend a work tolerance program.\n[8] In the summary of her report dated May 21, 1996, sent to the Corporation, Mrs. Labenski Blench concluded as follows:\nSUMMARY\nMr. Desrosiers is able to do sedentary and light duties. He is able to perform regular task involved with this category of job.\nHis needs do require proper ergonomic set-up for his work station (i.e. chair, desk, monitor, keyboard, etc.). He should be allowed to :\nChange position every 20-30 minutes. Stand for short periods of time, 5-6 minutes Do light lifting, carrying under 18 lb. Occasional stairs Push \/ pull carts with 20 lb. resistance or less. Unlimited dexterity activities.\nOPINION\nMr. Desrosiers seems motivated to return to a sedentary-light duty job.\nHis potential functionality for such a job seems adequate at this time.\nSUGGESTIONS :\nSix weeks of work hardening to increase his flexibility and endurance. Ten weeks of exercises in a gym set-up or in house programme. Ensure ergonomic set-up of the work place is adequate. [sic]\n[9] This report from the Movement Analysis and Treatment Centre was the last medical examination the Corporation requested in Desrosiers' case.\n[10] The parties have acknowledged in their Joint Admissions of Facts that in August 1997, the Corporation posted a competition for a management analyst position, classified at the CS-03 level. As human resources officer for the Huron\/Rideau region, Dinis was responsible for staffing vacant positions as well as for employees who were declared surplus. In the performance of her duties, she was responsible for writing the competition poster for the management analyst position.\n[11] The poster describes the duties of the position as follows:\n[Translation]\nPlans, coordinates and manages activities related to telecommunications support, micro-computing support, mail processing systems support, improvements and configuration control related to information systems, telecommunication networks and to National mail sorting systems. Ensures project management, does the follow-up on service integrator's activities and coordinates changes. Prepares requirement definitions and various analyses for equipment improvements. Acts as a technician and installs equipment. Acts as a technical advisor for the manager and for customers (internal or external). Supervises a support group, assigns tasks, coordinates the group activities, participates to job ratings, writes procedures, manages service requests and ensures training.\nThe qualifications were as follows:\n[Translation]\nBilingualism is imperative. University or college diploma in the computer, electronic or telecommunications field or successful completion of secondary school paired with a minimum of 5 years' experience in these fields. Very good experience in telecommunication networks (voice and data) and micro-computers related to the design, installation, testing, support and on maintenance of equipment and software is needed. Experience in planning, management and projects of personnel management.\n[12] The poster also stated that candidates had to demonstrate that they meet the requirements mentioned.\n[13] According to the evidence presented by the Corporation, the management analyst must carry out all the activities of a technician, including moving filing cabinets or desks to gain access to cables or electrical outlets; moving communication cabinets; moving network control units; removing and replacing floor tiles in the computer room; moving and carrying boxes containing telephones, modems and cables. He must also lift and install equipment that can weigh between 60 and 70 pounds.\n[14] In their rebuttal, Desrosiers and the Commission argued that nothing in the job poster expressly stated that there were physical requirements attached to this position. They also said that the poster described some fifteen duties and that the only one that might implicitly call for physical requirements would be the one stating that the incumbent acts as a technician, installs equipment. The other duties, in their view, entail more intellectual requirements, a conclusion with which Dinis said she agreed. They also said that the poster did not call for the candidate to be able to move filing cabinets, communication cabinets or floor tiles.\n[15] Rod Magliocco, who has held the management analyst position since winning the competition in September 1997, testified about the duties of the position. He testified that a management analyst is responsible for managing, supporting and advising the users of telecommunication networks (voice and data). He is also responsible for coordinating and managing support activities in telecommunications, mail processing systems, upgrades and configuration control related to information systems, telecommunication networks and national mail sorting systems for the Rideau region. This region extends north to Petawawa, east to Cornwall, including the Ottawa Valley and the Hull and Gatineau region, and south to Brockville, Kingston, Belleville and Peterborough. In some cases, more than three (3) hours of travel may be involved. The management analyst is often called on to help out people experiencing problems with their computers, printers, fax machines or telephone lines. In his various tasks, he may be required to move equipment or furniture weighing over 18 pounds. Magliocco admitted, however, that movers can be used in some cases and that there are what he termed Service Level Agreements under which the supplier installs the new equipment.\n[16] Desrosiers submitted his candidacy to Dinis on August 7, 1997, a few weeks before the deadline for the submission of candidacies, which was set at August 29, 1997.\n[17] On August 8, 1997, Desrosiers and Dinis had a telephone conversation during which they briefly discussed the competition, the requirements of the position in terms of hours of work and travel requirements. Desrosiers apparently also asked that he be sent the job description for the position as well as the statement of qualifications. This conversation did not touch on Desrosiers' family status.\n[18] While Dinis was on annual leave, Jammes, a human resources officer at the Corporation, was assigned to screen the candidates. After the deadline set in the poster for submitting candidacies, Jammes began the screening process. This process consists in determining which candidates, if any, will be accepted into the competition process. To this end, she was to refer to, among other things, the requirements of the Collective Agreement and to the staffing directives of Treasury Board. The Treasury Board directives state, inter alia, that medical suitability is one of the conditions of employment which must be administered according to Treasury Board policy and be met before appointment [translation].\n[19] Thus, as part of this screening process, she said she asked the Corporation's health services about Desrosiers' particular limitations. On September 3, 1997, Dr. Robert Belzile, of the Corporation's health services, informed Jammes of Desrosiers' physical restrictions. In his memorandum, Dr. Belzile basically repeated the findings of the report of May 21, 1996, of the Movement Analysis and Treatment Centre, which stated that Desrosiers could not lift objects heavier than 18 pounds, that he was to change position every 20-30 minutes and that he could stand only for short periods of 5-6 minutes.\n[20] After receiving this information, Jammes, in light of the Treasury Board requirements and the physical requirements of the position, concluded that Desrosiers would not be able to perform the duties of the management analyst position, and therefore screened out his candidacy.\n[21] As for a possible accommodation for Desrosiers, she admitted that she had considered this only very, very briefly. In her view, the accommodation, in this case, would have necessitated another employee accompanying Desrosiers, particularly when he was travelling, and this, according to her, was impossible. When cross-examined in this regard, Jammes had this to say:\nQ. You said earlier today that you briefly considered accommodating Mr. Desrosiers ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you make any written notes as to what you had considered, as far as possible accommodations for Mr. Desrosiers ?\nA. No, when I say I briefly, you know, I mean a fleeting thing because basically when I say briefly I am thinking what can I do. I mean what could, what assistant devices I do not know of any. Certainly, as I said in my testimony in-chief, you know I went through a process of looking at what was required against this and made my decision from there.\nAs for alternate accommodations, I did not consider any alternate.\nQ. Did you, perhaps make any request for financial analysis of what consequences would be entailed by hiring another employee?\nA. No, that would not be up to me to do that.\nQ. Aside from your brief consideration, your fleeting thought as you yourself said, you did not really consider anything else?\nA. No, to my understanding, there was nothing else.\n[sic]\n[22] Finally, Desrosiers alleges that he had another telephone conversation with Dinis, on September 18, 1997, during which she told him that he had not qualified for the competition because, among other things, the management analyst position did not fit well with his family obligations since the incumbent would be required to do evening work. Dinis denies having had this telephone conversation with Desrosiers or having ever discussed his family status with him.\nIV. ISSUES OF LAW [23] The parties submitted the following issues of law to the Tribunal:\nDid the Corporation discriminate against Desrosiers in rejecting his candidacy for the position of management analyst based on his disability or perceived disability (back injury) or his family status, in contravention of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6? If the Tribunal answers the above question in the affirmative, has the Corporation demonstrated that the rejection of Desrosiers' candidacy was justified by a bona fide occupational requirement within the meaning of the case law and\/or the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6?\nV. LEGAL FRAMEWORK [24] Desrosiers filed a complaint against the Corporation under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 7 states that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. During the relevant period, certain practices were not regarded as discriminatory under the terms of section 15 of the Act. Paragraph (a) of section 15 stated that it was not a discriminatory practice if any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference was established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\n[25] Since the Supreme Court decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 [also called Meiorin] and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 [also called Grismer], the conventional distinction between direct discrimination and indirect discrimination has given way to a unified approach to processing human rights complaints. According to this approach, it is incumbent first on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in favour of the complainant, in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\n[26] Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the onus shifts to the respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that there is a bona fide justification for the discriminatory policy or standard. Thus, the respondent must prove that:\nit adopted the standard for a purpose or goal rationally connected to the performance of the job. The focus at this step is not on the validity of the particular standard, but rather on the validity of its more general purpose, such as the safe and efficient performance of the job. Where the general purpose is to ensure the safe and efficient performance of the job, it will not be necessary to spend much time at this stage; it adopted the particular standard in good faith, in the belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of the legitimate work-related goal, with no intention of discriminating against the claimant. At this stage, the focus shifts from the general purpose of the standard to the standard itself; the impugned standard is reasonably necessary to accomplish its goal, that is, the safe and efficient performance of the job. The employer must demonstrate that it cannot accommodate the claimant and others affected by the standard without suffering undue hardship. It must ensure that any procedure that has been adopted to assess the issue of accommodation considers the possibility that it may unduly discriminate on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Moreover, the substantive content of a more accommodating standard offered by the employer must be adapted to each case. Subsidiarily, the employer must justify why it has not offered such a standard.\n[27] The Meiorin and Grismer decisions include parameters for determining whether a defence based on undue hardship has been established. In Meiorin, the Supreme Court pointed out that the use of the term undue infers that some hardship is acceptable. In order to meet the standard, the hardship imposed must be undue. It may be ideal from the employer's perspective to choose a standard that is uncompromisingly stringent. Yet the standard, if it is to be justified under the human rights legislation, must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship.\n[28] The Supreme Court also pointed out that the respondent, in order to prove that its standard is reasonably necessary, always bears the burden of demonstrating that the standard incorporates every possible accommodation to the point of undue hardship. [See Grismer, supra, para. 32.] It is incumbent on the respondent to show that it considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation. The respondent must prove that incorporating aspects of individual accommodation within the standard was impossible short of undue hardship. [See Grismer, supra, para. 42.] In some cases, excessive cost may justify a refusal to accommodate those with disabilities. However, one must be wary of putting too low a value on accommodating the disabled. It is all too easy to cite increased cost as a reason for refusing to accord the disabled equal treatment. [See Grismer, supra, para. 41.] The adoption of the respondent's standard must be supported by convincing evidentiary elements. According to Meiorin and Grismer, impressionistic evidence of increased expense will not generally suffice. [See Grismer, supra, para. 41 and 42.] One must devise practical, non-pecuniary and innovative means of accommodation. Finally, factors such as the cost of possible means of accommodation should be applied with common sense and flexibility in the context of the factual circumstance presented in each case. [See Meiorin, supra, para. 63.]\n[29] Concerning the application of the Meiorin and Grismer decisions, rendered after the events of the case at bar, for determining whether the standard applied by the respondent constitutes a bona fide occupational requirement, I would mention that it is a fundamental tenet of our legal system that the common law always speaks from the moment that it is pronounced to all prior events. [See Irvine v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [2001] C.H.R.T. No. 39, para. 120.]\nVI. ANALYSIS A. Has the complainant established a prima faciecase of discrimination in contravention of section 7? (i) Discrimination based on family status [30] In my view, Desrosiers has not discharged his initial burden of proof and has not succeeded in demonstrating that the respondent discriminated against him based on his family status. According to Desrosiers, there was a telephone conversation with Dinis on September 18, 1997, during which she informed him that he had not been accepted for the competition. He also alleges that she then told him that the position of management analyst did not fit well with his family obligations because the incumbent would be required to do evening work. Dinis denies having had this telephone conversation with Desrosiers or having ever discussed his family status with him. The Joint Admissions of Facts states that on September 18, 1997, Dinis did indeed inform Desrosiers, but by e-mail, that his candidacy for the competition had been rejected because he did not meet the physical requirements of the position due to his medical restrictions. No mention at all is made of his family status.\n[31] It may very well be that at some time or other Desrosiers' family status was raised in connection with the position requirements, which required the incumbent to be on call and to travel. However, I am not convinced that this issue influenced the respondent's decision as to whether or not to assign the job to Desrosiers.\n(ii) Discrimination based on a disability [32] Subsection 3(1) of the Act stipulates:\nFor all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are [...] disability [...].\n[33] We have already seen that section 7 states that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination, and that paragraph (a) of section 15, at the time in question, stipulated that it was not a discriminatory practice if any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment was established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement. Section 25 of the Act defines disability as any previous or existing mental or physical disability.\n[34] Thus, a disability may be the result of a physical limitation, a perceived limitation, or a combination of the two. [See Quebec (C.D.P.D.J. v. Montr\u00e9al (City), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665, para. 79.] The Tribunal must therefore consider in its determination not only the complainant's medical condition, but also the circumstances in which a distinction is made. In other words, in the context of the impugned practice of an employer, the Tribunal must determine, inter alia, whether an actual or perceived ailment causes the complainant to experience the loss or limitation of opportunities to take part in the life of the community to the same extent as others. [See Quebec (C.D.P.D.J. v. Montr\u00e9al (City), supra, para. 80.]\n[35] In most cases, the complainant will have the burden of proving (1) the existence of a distinction, exclusion or preference; (2) that the distinction, exclusion or preference is based on a ground enumerated in the Act; and (3) that the distinction, exclusion or preference has the effect of nullifying or impairing the right to full and equal exercise of human rights. [See Quebec (C.D.P.D.J. v. Montr\u00e9al (City), supra, para. 84.]\n[36] It is important to recall that, at this stage, the complainant has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, that is, one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in favour of the complainant, in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\n[37] In the case at bar, I am convinced that there is a prima facie case of a distinction based on an actual or perceived physical disability in the treatment of Desrosiers at the time of his candidacy for the position. I also believe that his health condition, in this case his back pain, may constitute a disability and thus be a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Act. [See Quebec (C.D.P.D.J. v. Montr\u00e9al (City), supra, para. 82.] It is also clear that this distinction in the treatment of Desrosiers had the effect of depriving him of the opportunity to participate fully in the job competition.\n[38] Moreover, this conclusion is strongly supported by the facts. I refer, notably, to the Joint Admissions of Facts in which the parties have acknowledged that Desrosiers' candidacy was not accepted due to the fact that he is medically unfit to perform the requirements of this vacant position. I refer also to an e-mail from Jammes dated September 4, 1997, in which she states I have screened Mr. Desrosiers out of the competition process due to the fact that he is medically unable to perform the requirements of this vacant position.\n[39] A prima facie case of discrimination having been established, it is now incumbent on the respondent to demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that it is based on a bona fide occupational requirement. In order to determine whether the respondent has successfully met its burden of proof, I propose to follow the three-step approach proposed by the Supreme Court in Meiorin and Grismer.\n[40] In its oral argument, counsel for the respondent, to support her argument that the complainant has not established a prima facie case, relies on three decisions rendered before Meiorin and Grismer, to wit, Rivard v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [1990] C.H.R.T. No 5; Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) v. Bouchard, [1991] C.H.R.T. No 14; and Boivin v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [1994] C.H.R.T. No 2. With all due respect to the Tribunal members who heard them, I do not think that these cases are relevant, in view of the new approach proposed by the Supreme Court.\n[41] I must now continue my analysis and determine whether this discrimination established on a prima facie case is based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\nB. Is the discrimination based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR)? (i) Was the standard adopted for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the particular job? [42] The first step in assessing whether the employer has successfully established a BFOR defence is to identify the general purpose of the impugned standard and determine whether it is rationally connected to the performance of the job. It is therefore necessary to determine what the impugned standard is generally designed to achieve. The ability to work safely and efficiently is the purpose most often mentioned in the cases. [See Meiorin, supra, para. 57.] The employer must demonstrate that there is a rational connection between the general purpose for which the impugned standard was introduced and the objective requirements of the job. Where the general purpose of the standard is to ensure the safe and efficient performance of the job it will not be necessary to spend much time at this stage. [See Meiorin, supra, para. 58.] The focus at this first step is not on the validity of the particular standard that is at issue, but rather on the validity of its more general purpose.\n[43] The standard in the present case is found in a Treasury Board document entitled Staffing Information, which states:\n[Translation]\nMedical suitability, security and reliability are conditions of employment which must be administered according to Treasury Board policy. They must be met before appointment.\n[44] According to the Commission, the particular standard is not rationally connected to the process of screening candidates for jobs. I cannot agree with this conclusion. In my view, the only relevant issue at this stage is whether the general purpose of the standard is valid. This purpose is to allow the employer to identify employees or applicants who are unable to perform the job safely and efficiently. In the case at bar, the medical suitability and security conditions assure the purpose of safe performance of the job, while reliability addresses the purpose of efficiency. I conclude from this that there is an obvious rational connection between the standard and the performance of the job in question.\n(ii) Did the employer adopt the standard with an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose, with no intention of discriminating against the complainant? [45] In Meiorin, Madam Justice McLachlin explains the second step of this approach as follows:\nOnce the legitimacy of the employer's more general purpose is established, the employer must take the second step of demonstrating that it adopted the particular standard with an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the accomplishment of its purpose, with no intention of discriminating against the claimant. This addresses the subjective element of the test which, although not essential to a finding that the standard is not a BFOR, is one basis on which the standard may be struck down. If the imposition of the standard was not thought to be reasonably necessary or was motivated by discriminatory animus, then it cannot be a BFOR. [See Meiorin, supra, para. 60.]\n[46] Contrary to the Commission's argument, there is no indication in the case at bar that the employer did not act with an honest and good faith belief that the adoption of the particular standard was necessary in order to identify persons who would be unable to perform the job safely and efficiently. In adopting this standard, the respondent did not at all intend to discriminate against Desrosiers.\n(iii) Is the impugned standard reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose? [47] In order to demonstrate that the standard was reasonably necessary to achieve the intended purpose, namely, to identify employees or candidates who would be unable to perform the work safely and efficiently, the Corporation must show that it was impossible to accommodate Desrosiers or other employees having similar characteristics without experiencing undue hardship.\n[48] The Supreme Court has this to say on the subject of undue hardship:\nWhen referring to the concept of undue hardship, it is important to recall the words of Sopinka J. who observed in Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, at p. 984, that [t]he use of the term 'undue' infers some hardship is acceptable; it is only 'undue' hardship that satisfies this test. It may be ideal from the employer's perspective to choose a standard that is uncompromisingly stringent. Yet the standard, if it is to be justified under the human rights legislation, must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship.\n[See Meiorin, supra, para. 62]\n[49] When the Act was amended in 1998, subsection 15(2) was added. According to this subsection, the factors the employer can consider to determine whether an accommodation would impose on it undue hardship are health, safety and cost. However, the events that gave rise to the present complaint occurred prior to the adoption of this amendment; as pointed out in Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, 2003 CHRT.2, my consideration of the accommodation issue must therefore be governed, not by the new subsection 15(2), but rather by the principles articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Alberta (Human Rights Commission) v. Central Dairy Pool, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489, at pages 520 and 521:\nI do not find it necessary to provide a comprehensive definition of what constitutes undue hardship but I believe it may be helpful to list some of the factors that may be relevant to such an appraisal. I begin by adopting those identified by the Board of Inquiry in the case at bar -- financial cost, disruption of a collective agreement, problems of morale of other employees, interchangeability of work force and facilities. The size of the employer's operation may influence the assessment of whether a given financial cost is undue or the ease with which the work force and facilities can be adapted to the circumstances. Where safety is at issue both the magnitude of the risk and the identity of those who bear it are relevant considerations. This list is not intended to be exhaustive and the results which will obtain from a balancing of these factors against the right of the employee to be free from discrimination will necessarily vary from case to case.\n[50] As we have already indicated, there are parameters for determining whether a defence based on undue hardship has been established. The use of the term undue obviously infers that some hardship is acceptable. In order to meet the standard, the hardship imposed must be undue. For it to be justified under the human rights legislation, the standard chosen by the employer must accommodate factors relating to the unique abilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship.\n[51] The respondent, in order to prove that the standard is reasonably necessary, has the burden of demonstrating that it incorporates every possible accommodation. It will have to establish that it considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation and that incorporating aspects of individual accommodation within the standard was impossible short of undue hardship. In some circumstances excessive cost may justify a refusal to accommodate those with disabilities. However, one must be wary of putting too low a value on accommodating the disabled. It is all too easy to cite increased cost as a reason for refusing to accord the disabled equal treatment. The respondent's case must be supported by convincing evidentiary elements. Impressionistic evidence will not generally suffice.\n[52] According to the Commission and the complainant, in order to determine whether in this case there was undue hardship the Tribunal must look to the approach proposed by Madam Justice McLachlin in Meiorin. In this decision she points out that apart from individual testing to determine whether the person has the aptitudes or qualifications necessary to perform the work, the possibility that there may be different ways to perform the job while still accomplishing the employer's legitimate work-related purpose should be considered. [See Meiorin, supra, para. 64.]\n[53] Let us broach the issue of the individual appraisal of Desrosiers to determine whether he had the aptitudes or qualifications necessary to perform the work. At the hearing, Jammes testified that she had considered the physical requirements for the position and assessed them against Desrosiers' physical limitations as reported by Dr. Belzile of the Corporation's health services. Dr. Robert Belzile, relying on the conclusions of a report prepared some 15 months earlier by the Movement Analysis and Treatment Centre, concluded that Desrosiers could not lift objects heavier than 18 pounds, that he must change position every 20-30 minutes and that he could stand only for short periods of 5-6 minutes. Dr. Belzile was not called to testify.\n[54] After receiving this information, Jammes concluded that Desrosiers could not carry out the duties of the position of management analyst. She therefore screened out Desrosiers' candidacy.\n[55] The Corporation also presented in evidence the testimony of Rod Magliocco, who has held the position of management analyst since winning the competition in September 1997. Mr. Magliocco testified about the duties of the position. His testimony concerned the duties of the position as they existed in 1997 and as they have evolved since. The Corporation also produced in evidence the expert evidence of Jeff Pajot, an ergonomist and president of Pajot Ergonomics, who presented two reports. The first, entitled Analyse des exigences physiques. Gestion des donn\u00e9es, analyste-programmeur-Gestion des syst\u00e8mes d'ordinateurs (CS-3) [Analysis of physical requirements. Data management, programmer analyst, Computer systems management (CS-3)] was prepared December 17, 2002. In this report, Mr. Pajot stated that on December 12, 2002, he did an ergonomic analysis of the position of programmer analyst. He also stated that the data used in his analysis were taken from workplace observations and an interview with Mr. Rod Magliocco. The second report, entitled \u00c9valuation du poste CS-3 \u00e0 Postes Canada par rapport aux qualit\u00e9s personnelles de Martin Desrosiers [Evaluation of the CS-3 position at Canada Post in relation to the personal suitability of Martin Desrosiers] was prepared January 13, 2003. In this report, Mr. Pajot said he had analysed the position to see whether it was suitable for Desrosiers. The ergonomic analysis done in December 2002 was based on the conclusions found in the previous report. Mr. Pajot never met with Desrosiers.\n[56] I give little weight to Mr. Magliocco's testimony and Mr. Pajot's reports. When determining whether the Corporation discharged its obligation to accommodate Desrosiers, the relevant question is as follows: At the time it was decided not to assign the position to Desrosiers because of his disability, did the Corporation make proper inquiries to determine the nature of his disability, what was the prognosis, what accommodation was required? [Conte v. Rogers Cablesystem Ltd., [1999] C.H.R.T. No. 4, para. 81.] Mr. Magliocco basically testified about the current duties of the position, while Mr. Pajot's reports are an attempt, five years later, to justify a decision. The relevance of such evidence in the human rights context is questionable. I must consider the evidence as it existed in 1997, not five years later. Furthermore, it is rather my impression that this ergonomic study is intended to justify, after the fact, the respondent's decision to deny Desrosiers the position because of his disability.\n[57] Despite the weakness of the evidence presented at the hearing by the Corporation, I nevertheless find that in 1997, Desrosiers' physical ability to perform the duties of the position was limited. The back injury suffered by Desrosiers in August 1995 required major surgery. In February 1996, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board of Ontario described Desrosiers' disability as permanent and said, among other things, that he was not to lift heavy objects. The only issue we must consider in this case is whether the respondent considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation for Desrosiers, without causing itself undue hardship.\n[58] In the case at bar, the only evidence having to do with seeking an accommodation was that of Jammes. She acknowledged having briefly considered (a fleeting thought) the matter of an accommodation for Desrosiers in view of his disability. According to her, the only possible accommodation, given Desrosiers' restrictions, would have been to have another employee accompany him while he performed his duties, particularly when he was travelling. She testified that in 1997 there was only one other position classified as CS-02, and requiring the incumbent to accompany Desrosiers while he performed his duties would have opened the door to the filing of a grievance by that employee on the grounds that he was required to perform the duties of a CS-03, and so ought to be paid the hourly wage of a CS-03. Under the collective agreement, this would have entitled the CS-02 to a wage increase of about $9,000. Creating another CS-02 position to replace the employee who would now have to accompany Desrosiers would have forced the Corporation to incur additional wage costs of $44,530. She also believed that Desrosiers was currently accommodated in his AS-03 position and that she had therefore committed no breach.\n[59] In cross-examination, Jammes acknowledged that she had not taken any notes concerning possible accommodations for Desrosiers. She also admitted never having requested a financial analysis about the possibility of hiring another employee to assist Desrosiers.\n[60] In order to prove that the standard is reasonably necessary, the respondent, as I said earlier, has the burden of demonstrating that the standard incorporates every possible accommodation to the point of undue hardship. It is therefore incumbent upon the respondent to establish that it considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation, which it obviously did not do in this case. Excessive cost may justify a refusal to accommodate people with disabilities, but according to Jammes, no financial analysis was done with respect to Desrosiers.\n[61] In her closing argument, counsel for the respondent referred to the ruling of the Divisional Court of Ontario in Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Roosma, [2002] O.J. No. 3688, notably paragraph 89 of this decision, in which the Court states:\n[...], I believe the Company's method of deliberation on the request for accommodation was sufficient. The circumstances constraining the Company were sufficiently apparent that detailed enquiry into the possibilities of accommodation was unnecessary.\n[62] I would point out, however, that in Roosma the employer made a real effort to offer an accommodation. In fact, the evidence shows that there were 8 to 10 meetings between the employer and the employees concerned to discuss accommodation. Different accommodation scenarios were considered, and in the end it was the employees who withdrew from these meetings. In the case at bar, there was never any real or serious consideration of a possible accommodation.\n[63] I therefore believe that the respondent has been unable to demonstrate in this case that there was undue hardship or that there was a bona fide occupational requirement. In support of this finding, we refer to the e-mail dated April 9, 2002, from Barry Butcher to Kevin Wilson, two employees of the Corporation, which we find in the admitted documentary evidence presented jointly by the complainant, the Commission and the respondent and which states, inter alia:\nThe employee [Desrosiers] has raised a formal Human Rights complaint and in the event that the case goes to a Tribunal, I want to make sure that we have a good handle and documented paper trail regarding his ability to complete the physical demands of the job. It looks at this point that there may be some of the tasks associated with the job that he could perform with assistive devices, but still others that are questionable.\n[64] This is the kind of question the employer should have put to itself in 1997, not in 2002.\n[65] I am aware in the case at bar that Desrosiers' candidacy was rejected at the screening stage and that there is nothing to indicate he would have obtained the position had he made it past this stage, but since the parties have chosen to bifurcate the issues of merits and of remedy, at this time I need not pursue the analysis of this issue any further.\nVII. CONCLUSION [66] The parties have submitted the following issues to the Tribunal:\na) Did the Corporation discriminate against Desrosiers in rejecting his candidacy for the position of management analyst based on his disability or perceived disability (back injury) or his family status, thereby contravening section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6?\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nThe Corporation did discriminate against Desrosiers in rejecting his candidacy for the position of management analyst based on his disability or perceived disability (back injury), thereby contravening section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6.\nThe Corporation did not discriminate against Desrosiers based on his family status.\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nb) If the Tribunal answers the above question in the affirmative, has the Corporation demonstrated that the rejection of Desrosiers' candidacy was based on a bona fide occupational requirement within the meaning of the case law and\/or the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Ms. Montreuil states that she is a transsexual.\n[2] The Bank brought two preliminary motions in relation to Ms. Montreuil's complaint. The first motion sought to have Ms. Montreuil's complaint dismissed, on the basis that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lacked the requisite degree of institutional independence and impartiality, as a result of certain provisions in its enabling legislation. This motion has now been withdrawn, as a consequence of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Bell Canada v. Canadian Telephone Employees Association(1)\n[3] The Bank's second motion seeks the summary dismissal of Ms. Montreuil's complaint. The body of Ms. Montreuil's complaint elaborates on her assertion that she is a transsexual: Ms. Montreuil states that she dresses as a woman, and is currently in a period of transition in order to become female.(2) The Bank contends that in the course of a proceeding before the Quebec Court of Appeal(3), Ms. Montreuil acknowledged that she had no intention of proceeding with sex reassignment surgery. As a consequence, the Bank says that Ms. Montreuil, by her own admission, is not a transsexual person in a period of transition in order to become female. As a result, her complaint should be summarily dismissed.\n[4] Ms. Montreuil submits that she has always maintained that she is transgendered (une transgenre), that is a person in transition between the male sex and the female sex. According to Ms. Montreuil, some people describe transgendered people as being like pre-operative transsexuals. Others would describe the transgendered as being full-time transvestites. Still others view the transgendered as part-male, part-female or she-males. Whatever terminology is used, Ms. Montreuil says, it is evident that a transgendered person is a person in an evolutionary stage, who could one day become a transsexual. Ms. Montreuil submits that where she is in this evolutionary process should be of no concern to the Bank. This is a personal issue, Ms. Montreuil says, and the position taken by the Bank constitutes an intolerable intrusion into Ms. Montreuil's private life.\n[5] Ms. Montreuil asks that the Tribunal dismiss the Bank's motion, with costs.\n[6] The fundamental question for the Tribunal on this motion is whether Ms. Montreuil's complaint involves a proscribed ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. If the complaint does not engage one of these proscribed grounds, then no breach of the Act can be established, and the complaint should be dismissed.\n[7] Ms. Montreuil describes herself in her complaint as a transsexual. There is a significant body of human rights jurisprudence that has found that discrimination on the basis of transsexualism constitutes sex discrimination.(4)\n[8] As a result, I am satisfied that on its face, Ms. Montreuil's complaint appears to come within the four corners of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and should proceed to a hearing, in order to determine whether Ms. Montreuil's allegations can be proven.\n[9] What the Bank appears to take issue with is the assertion in Ms. Montreuil's complaint that she is a transsexual person in a period of transition in order to become female. If the Bank is of the view that Ms. Montreuil has been inconsistent in her description of her condition, this is something that it may wish to explore in cross-examination.\n[10] It seems to me that ultimately, the question of whether an individual who describes herself as a transsexual, but has no intention of undergoing sex reassignment surgery, is indeed a transsexual, is a question that requires an evidentiary foundation to answer. As such, the issue should be dealt with in the context of the hearing itself, rather than on a preliminary basis.\n[11] Accordingly, the Bank's motion is dismissed, without prejudice to the Bank's right to pursue this argument at the hearing into the merits of Ms. Montreuil's complaint.\n[12] Insofar as Ms. Montreuil's request for costs is concerned, I agree with the Bank's submission that there is no authority in the Canadian Human Rights Act which would permit the Tribunal to grant a party her costs in relation to a preliminary motion. Section 53 (2) (c) of the Act empowers the Tribunal to compensate a successful complainant for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice. This section has been interpreted to include the awarding of costs.(5) However, the remedial jurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 53 of the Act is only engaged after there has been a finding that a respondent has committed a discriminatory practice. There has been no such finding in this case.\nI. ORDER [13] For these reasons, the Bank's motion is dismissed, without costs.\nOriginal signed by\nAnne L.

Mactavish\n[1] The pre-hearing questionnaires completed by the parties identified three preliminary issues in this case.\n[2] Firstly, the complainant asked that the style of cause in this proceeding be amended to change her name from her married name of Danielle Plante to her maiden name, that is, Danielle C\u00f4t\u00e9. The respondent does not object to this amendment. Accordingly, the style of cause shall be amended to reflect the name currently used by the complainant.\n[3] In its questionnaire, the respondent raised, as a preliminary issue, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to deal with this case, in light of a settlement agreement evidently entered into by the parties in February of 1999. In its written submissions, the respondent asked that this issue be dealt with at the hearing. I agree that this issue is better dealt with in the context of a hearing, and defer the issue to be dealt with at that time.\n[4] The final issue relates to the identity of the respondent. The complaint form signed by the complainant identifies her former employer, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as the respondent. The respondent submits that the RCMP is not a legal person, and thus cannot be subject to a human rights complaint. Rather, the respondent says, proceedings against the RCMP should be brought against the Attorney General of Canada (representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police).\n[5] The complainant points out that she was employed by the RCMP, and that the conduct complained of in her complaint was allegedly carried out by members of the Force. The complainant points to various RCMP policies dealing with workplace harassment, submitting that if the RCMP recognizes its obligations to provide a harassment-free workplace, and fails to live up to its obligations, it leaves itself open to claims such as hers. The complainant further alleges that the RCMP has claimed that the Force itself has been injured by her actions. The complainant also points to a number of previous decisions of this Tribunal in cases where the RCMP, and other government departments, were named as respondents.\n[6] The complainant disputes the respondent's submission that she will not suffer any prejudice if the style of cause is changed to reflect the Attorney General of Canada as the respondent. As I understand the complainant's submissions, she is of the view that the RCMP, concerned about how the facts of her case will reflect on the image of the force, is endeavoring to hide behind the Attorney General of Canada.\n[7] The issue raised by the respondent relates to the legal technicalities of litigation involving the federal government. While I understand how the respondent's request may appear to the complainant, I do not believe that the RCMP is endeavoring to hide behind the Attorney General of Canada. Rather, the force is asking that the strict requirements of the law be observed. This has not always happened in previous cases before this Tribunal involving the RCMP. Thus, as the complainant has pointed out, there are a number of Tribunal decisions involving the RCMP as a named respondent. Nevertheless, a review of the jurisprudence cited by the respondent, as well as the relevant provisions of the Crown Liability Act, discloses that the respondent is correct, and that the complainant's case should properly be asserted against the Attorney General of Canada (representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police).\n[8] I do not accept the complainant's submission that she will be prejudiced if such an amendment is made. The change to the style of cause should not result in any delay in the prosecution of the complainant's case, nor will it affect her ability to execute on any award of damages, should her complaint ultimately prove successful.\n[9] For these reasons, both amendment requests are granted. The name of the complainant shall be changed from Danielle Plante to Danielle C\u00f4t\u00e9. The name of the respondent will be changed to the Attorney General of Canada (representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police).\nOriginal signed by\nAnne L.

Hadjis\n[1] This decision relates to a matter that the Trial Division of the Federal Court referred back to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for rehearing.\nI. History of the Case [2] On March 20, 1998, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) alleging that the Respondent had discriminated against him by refusing to continue to employ him because of a disability, namely, a pneumothorax of the left lung.\n[3] The Commission referred the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for inquiry and a hearing was conducted in October 2001.\n[4] On February 1, 2002, the Tribunal released its decision (the Tribunal Decision) allowing the complaint (Dumont v. Transport Jeannot Gagnon Inc., [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 2 (C.H.R.T.) (QL)). The Tribunal ordered the Respondent to compensate the Complainant for his lost wages. The Tribunal did not, however, make an order for special compensation, pursuant to s. 53(3) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act), as it read prior to the Bill S-5 amendments of 1998. The Tribunal concluded that the Complainant's testimony did not show that he suffered moral damages giving entitlement to compensation in this regard. Interestingly, a review of the case transcript reveals that the Commission did not make any significant argument before the Tribunal in favour of the proposition that special compensation should be awarded, other than a basic assertion that the evidence and the conduct of the Respondent enable (permettent) the Tribunal to make such an order.\n[5] The Commission applied to the Federal Court for judicial review of the Tribunal Decision. The application dealt strictly with the refusal by the Tribunal to award any compensation under s. 53(3) of the Act.\n[6] On December 9, 2002, Madame Justice Tremblay-Lamer's judgment on the application for judicial review was released (Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Dumont, 2002 FCT 1280). The Court recognized that the Act gives the Tribunal discretion in granting remedies. However, the Court also held that the Tribunal's refusal to consider compensation without providing a justification, despite uncontradicted evidence that the Complainant had suffered in respect of his feelings or self-respect, was an unreasonable exercise of that discretion. The Court, therefore, referred the matter back to the Tribunal for rehearing before a panel composed of different members. Accordingly, I was assigned by the Tribunal Chairperson to conduct the rehearing.\n[7] The Commission did not lead new evidence. It did, however, make submissions in writing, based on the existing record of the case, and in particular, excerpts from the transcripts of the Complainant's testimony. The Respondent informed the Tribunal Registry by letter that it had no submissions or comments to make regarding the matter other than to simply state that the Complainant did not suffer in respect of his feelings or self-respect (dommages moraux).\nII. Legal Framework and Analysis [8] The facts giving rise to the complaint all occurred prior to the amendments to the Act that took effect on June 30, 1998. Under the older version of the Act, s. 53(3) provided the following:\nSpecial compensation\n(3) In addition to any order that the Tribunal may make pursuant to subsection (2), if the Tribunal finds that (a) a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly,\nor\n(b) the victim of the discriminatory practice has suffered in respect of feelings or self-respect as a result of the practice,\nthe Tribunal may order the person to pay such compensation to the victim, not exceeding five thousand dollars, as the Tribunal may determine.\n(3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de cinq mille dollars, s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion, selon le cas:\na) que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9;\nb) que la victime en a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\nIndemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale\nIt has been held that the $5,000 maximum award must be reserved for the very worst cases that fall within the range of cases in which such awards are warranted. (Premakumar v. Air Canada (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 at para. 107 (C.H.R.T.); Desormeaux v. Ottawa Carleton Regional Transit Commission, 2003 CHRT 2 at para.128).\n[9] The Commission argues that as a general rule, human rights tribunals will order such special compensation whenever a complaint has been substantiated. It is only in exceptional circumstances that such compensation is denied. While it certainly may be that orders for special compensation have been granted in most of the cases where there has been a finding of discrimination, I am not persuaded that as a rule, such orders should necessarily be made. One must always examine the circumstances of each case and determine whether the criteria set out in the Act have been satisfied.\n[10] In the present case, the Complainant was hired by the Respondent to work for an indeterminate period as a semi-trailer truck operator assigned mainly to long-distance haulage. After suffering a perforation of his left lung (pneumothorax) while delivering a shipment in Ohio, he underwent treatment that prevented him from returning to work for about a month. The Respondent, however, informed the Complainant that he would not be permitted to return to his job at the end of this period. According to the Tribunal Decision, the Respondent refused to continue to employ the Complainant because it feared a recurrence of his illness. The Respondent was therefore found to have discriminated against the Complainant on the basis of his disability.\n[11] As a result of the dismissal, the Complainant was forced to seek out and gain other employment. By May 1998, when he decided to give up his career as a long-distance truck operator, the Complainant had worked for at least three different employers, and he was occasionally unemployed between jobs. He testified that as a result of being dismissed, he began questioning his self-worth and wondering what other misfortune the future would hold for him.\n[12] The Complainant suffered some loss of income as well, in the amount of $1,700. Although the Respondent was later ordered by the Tribunal to compensate the Complainant for this loss, the shortfall, at the time it occurred, had affected his financial well-being, especially when taking into account his fairly modest income. The loss may have even contributed to his eventual bankruptcy, although I note that the evidence is insufficient to satisfactorily support a conclusion in this regard.\n[13] Overall, the Complainant is upset that he had to endure this inconvenience and grief needlessly, or in his words, for nothing.\n[14] Taking into consideration all of the relevant circumstances of this case, I order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant the sum of $2,500 in special compensation, pursuant to s. 53(3) of the older version of the Act. Interest shall be payable in accordance with the terms of the Tribunal Decision, however, in no case shall the interest be allowed to exceed the maximum allowable sum of $5000 (Canada (Attorney General) v. Hebert (1995), C.H.R.R. D\/375 at para. 23 (F.C.T.D.).).\n\u00ab Original signed by \u00bb\nAthanasios D.

I am more concerned, however, about the material in the file from the Saanich police department, which concerns allegations of sexual assault. Some of this material is of a private nature.\n[2] I have nevertheless found it impossible to separate the allegations of sexual assault from the broader allegation of harassment. As a matter of natural justice, I accordingly believe that the Respondent is entitled to review the police file in preparing its defence.\n[3] This still leaves a question of disclosure. Aside from any ancillary powers that the Tribunal may enjoy, section 52(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act gives the Tribunal the authority to take any measures and make any order that it considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry. The section refers to the inquiry rather than the hearing, and in my view includes the disclosure of documents under the Tribunal's rules.\n[4] I am satisfied that the public disclosure of the more sensitive material could cause undue hardship to the Complainant under section 52(1)(c). I am accordingly ordering the release of the file, on the condition that its confidentiality is maintained. The material on the file is not to be shared with anyone outside the employment of counsel, other than medical or psychological witnesses. The same direction applies to the medical information. I wish to make it clear that I consider any contravention of this direction a breach of my order.\n[5] I should add that the release of documents for the purposes of disclosure does not mean that they are admissible or even relevant to the hearing.

Three months after he had a seizure while at work, Mr. Milano lost his job as a Service Technician with Triple K Transport Ltd. The issue in this case is whether there was a relationship between these two events.\nI. Mr. Milano\u2019s Employment with Triple K [2] Mr. Milano is a licenced mechanic, with provincial certification entitling him to repair automobiles, heavy duty equipment, motor coaches and trucks. In addition to holding these licences, Mr. Milano has taken training courses in mechanics offered by companies such as John Deere and General Motors. Mr. Milano\u2019s experience with the mechanics trade goes back to the 1960's. His more recent experience includes 12 years running his own forklift company in Florida, where he supervised and performed repairs, including electrical repairs, on industrial lift trucks. He then went to work at John Deere as a Service Foreman. At John Deere, Mr. Milano supervised between 10-20 mechanics performing repairs on trucks and other heavy equipment. Mr. Milano next worked for Adams Industrial Equipment, where he repaired trucks, trailers, off- road vehicles and forklifts.\n[3] In April of 1995, Mr. Milano set up his own automotive repair shop. From April of 1995 to July of 1999, Mr. Milano worked with his son-in-law, repairing cars and trucks, and doing Ontario vehicle safety checks. After his son-in-law left the business, Mr. Milano went to work for Abbotsford Trucking as a mechanic. Mr. Milano was diagnosed with epilepsy in 1999, although it appears from his medical records that he first started having problems with seizures as early as 1996. Mr. Milano testified that although his epilepsy is now controlled by medication, in 1999, he was having regular seizures. These seizures interfered with Mr. Milano\u2019s ability to do his job, and caused him to lose his driver\u2019s licence. Because of his medical problems, Mr. Milano left his employment at Abbotsford Trucking.\n[4] Following his departure from Abbotsford Trucking, Mr. Milano worked with his doctor to get his epilepsy under control, and to get his driver\u2019s licence back. Once he regained his licence, Mr. Milano began looking for new employment. One of Mr. Milano\u2019s acquaintances was an individual by the name of Don Greenough. Mr. Greenough worked at Triple K Transport Ltd., in Stittsville, Ontario. Triple K is a heavy commodities hauler, primarily involved in hauling steel and steel products for steel producers. Mr. Greenough told Mr. Milano that Triple K was looking for mechanics. Mr. Milano met with Dave Croft, Triple K\u2019s Director of Maintenance. During the course of his interview with Mr. Croft, Mr. Milano says that Mr. Croft asked him if he had any health problems, a question that Mr. Milano found strange. Because he thought that his epilepsy was under control, Mr. Milano answered Mr. Croft in the negative.\n[5] Mr. Milano was offered a job at Triple K as a Service Technician, or mechanic, and started work on October 23, 2000. Mr. Milano worked on the afternoon shift, from 2:30 p.m. to 11 p.m., under the supervision of Del Higginson. Mr. Milano was hired pursuant to a written employment contract. This contract described Mr. Milano\u2019s duties as ... general shop duties - responsible for the maintenance of the fleet of vehicles operated by Triple K Transport Ltd.. Amongst other terms, the contract provided for a ...starting hourly rate of $18.50 \/ hour with a review after 3 months.\n[6] Mr. Milano testified that he loved working at Triple K - his co-workers were great, and he liked the work. He stated that he was not eased into his position, but immediately went right to work, performing a full range of duties repairing Triple K\u2019s trucks and trailers.\n[7] On November 10, 2000, Mr. Milano had a seizure at work. Mr. Milano does not remember what happened. However, Don Greenough, who was working beside Mr. Milano at the time, testified that Mr. Milano suddenly fell to the floor. Mr. Greenough called to his colleagues for assistance, and an ambulance was called. Mr. Milano recalls regaining consciousness in an ambulance en route to the Queensway-Carleton Hospital. He stayed at the hospital for a few hours, prior to being discharged with a referral to see a neurologist. Mr. Milano then went to see Dr. Hyman Rabinovitch, who had treated him previously. On November 11, 2000, Dr. Rabinovitch certified that Mr. Milano was ready to return to work, with the restriction that he could not operate a motor vehicle, as Mr. Milano\u2019s driver\u2019s licence had been suspended once again, because of his having had a seizure.\n[8] Mr. Milano returned to work at Triple K. He testified that he was feeling great, and that his medication appeared to be controlling the seizures. According to Mr. Milano, the fact that he was unable to drive the trucks in the repair area did not present a significant problem, as other employees would simply do it for him. While Mr. Milano did not encounter any difficulties with his co-workers after his return to work, he testified that he felt that Dave Croft was treating him differently. Mr. Croft seemed very concerned about Mr. Milano\u2019s situation, and asked a lot of questions about his medications. More troubling to Mr. Milano was the fact that Mr. Croft seemed to talk down to him, as if he were mentally defective. Mr. Milano felt very demeaned by Mr. Croft\u2019s behavior, and complained to Mr. Higginson about it. He also mentioned his concerns to some of his co-workers. Mr. Milano says that they assured him that this was just the way that Dave is.\n[9] From mid-November, 2000 until February of 2001, Mr. Milano continued work at Triple K, without incident. According to Mr. Milano, it was very busy in the repair shop, and there was always a lot to do. There was no indication that the company was in any financial difficulty, or that lay-offs or terminations were in the offing. As a result, he was stunned when, on February 5, 2001, he was told by Mr. Croft that he was being let go. According to Mr. Milano, Mr. Croft gave him a long speech about the state of the steel business, concluding by saying that Triple K was terminating Mr.Milano\u2019s employment. Mr. Croft explained that as Mr. Milano was the last mechanic to have been hired, he would be the first one to go.\n[10] Mr. Croft and Mr. Milano agreed that Mr. Milano\u2019s last day of work would be February 23, 2001. Although he found it humiliating to have to keep coming to work after he had been fired, Mr. Milano says that he swallowed [his] pride, and conducted himself in a professional manner.\n[11] Shortly after the termination meeting, Mr. Croft provided Mr. Milano with a letter of reference, attesting to the good quality of his workmanship, his willingness to perform any task asked of him, and his positive attitude.\n[12] Mr. Milano testified that he was shattered by being fired. He couldn\u2019t figure out why his employment was being terminated. Although Mr. Croft claimed that there was a downturn in the steel business, there seemed to be a lot of work to do in the shop at Triple K, and the company was advertising to hire more drivers. As a result, Mr. Milano concluded that negative business conditions were being put forward as an excuse.\n[13] Mr. Milano asked himself whether he had said or done something to cause the loss of his job. Eventually, Mr. Milano came to the conclusion that the only reasonable explanation for the termination of his employment by Triple K was the fact that he had a disability. Mr. Milano explained that after three months of employment with Triple K, he would have been entitled to coverage under the company\u2019s health care insurance plan. In Mr. Milano\u2019s view, Triple K did not want to have to provide him with benefits because of his health condition.\n[14] Mr. Milano\u2019s suspicions as to the real reason for his termination were heightened when, immediately after he left the company on February 23, Luke Cavanagh started working as a mechanic at Triple K.\n[15] The Record of Employment issued to Mr. Milano on February 23, 2001, indicated that the reason for the termination of his employment was dismissal rather than shortage of work.\nII. Triple K\u2019s Explanation [16] Evidence with respect to Triple K\u2019s explanation was provided by Keith Sabiston, Dave Croft and Luke Cavanagh. Keith Sabiston is the founder, a shareholder in and the Chief Executive Officer of Triple K. Mr. Croft reports to Mr. Sabiston.\n[17] According to Mr. Sabiston, Triple K was satisfied with Mr. Milano\u2019s performance on the job. The fact that Mr. Milano suffered from epilepsy, and had a seizure at work, played no part in the decision to terminate his employment with Triple K. Rather, the company was required to let Mr. Milano go because of a downturn in the business.\n[18] Mr. Sabiston testified that the vast majority of Triple K\u2019s business involves the transport of commodities related to the steel industry, with the company servicing steel manufacturers in Qu\u00e9bec, Ontario and Michigan. As a consequence, Triple K\u2019s operations are highly sensitive to the performance of the North American steel industry.\n[19] In the winter of 2000-2001, the steel industry was not performing at all well. By the end of 2000, nine American steel manufacturers had sought bankruptcy protection. In Canada, Algoma Steel, one of Triple K\u2019s major clients, had its rating downgraded. By April of 2001, Algoma was insolvent, and was forced to seek court protection from its creditors. Triple K was owed in excess of $230,000 by Algoma at the time it filed for court protection, and was an unsecured creditor in the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act proceedings.\n[20] Escalating fuel costs led to an increase in Triple K\u2019s cost of doing business. Because these increased costs could often not be passed on to the company\u2019s customers, the increased fuel costs served to reduce Triple K\u2019s profit margins.\n[21] An additional pressure on Triple K\u2019s financial position was the exposure that the company faced as a consequence of an accident involving one of its tractors. Evidently, the tractor had knocked over a power line in a customer\u2019s yard. Because of the cost of insurance, the company elected to self-insure with respect to the accident, and had set up a reserve of $150,000 to cover the contingent liability.\n[22] In November of 2000, Triple K\u2019s sales were 25% lower than they had been for the same period in the previous year. At the same time, the company\u2019s labour costs were increasing.\n[23] The combined effect of these events was that in late 2000 and early 2001, Triple K was in the worst period of decline that Mr. Sabiston had seen in 23 years of business, and was in serious trouble. Mr. Sabiston testified that he was required to mortgage his home in order to raise working capital for the company. Mr. Sabiston also renegotiated and increased the company\u2019s bank debt.\n[24] Triple K began looking at ways to contain costs. Inventories were reduced, and overtime was eliminated. Four office staff had been let go in 1999, and approximately a dozen drivers left the company in 2000. Attention then turned to the maintenance area. Some maintenance work was contracted out to other companies. In consultation with Dave Croft, Mr. Sabiston also made the decision to terminate Mr. Milano\u2019s employment, and to enter into a contractual relationship with Luke Cavanagh. Mr. Sabiston says that Mr. Milano was chosen for termination because he was the last mechanic to have been hired.\n[25] Mr. Sabiston explained that Luke Cavanagh had worked for Triple K between November of 1999 and August of 2000. Mr. Cavanagh had expressed an interest in coming back to work at the company. Mr. Cavanagh was not retained to perform routine maintenance work, but was brought in to service and refurbish approximately 20 of Triple K\u2019s trailers, including some of the company\u2019s oldest trailers, that were not currently in active use.[1] According to Triple K\u2019s witnesses, Mr.Cavanagh was required to assess each trailer, to prepare a list of the work that had to be done, and to complete the necessary repairs, so that the trailers could be sold, or could be ready to go, if business picked up.\n[26] Because of the weight of the loads that Triple K trucks must haul, the flatbed trailers that the company uses are somewhat specialized in nature, having up to ten axles, in order to support the weight of the load. Dave Croft testified that even experienced, certified mechanics require up to a year of training and experience at the company, in order to be able to service Triple K\u2019s specialized equipment. According to Mr. Sabiston and Mr. Croft, Luke Cavanagh had the necessary experience to refurbish this type of trailer with minimal supervision.\n[27] Mr. Sabiston explained that Mr. Cavanagh was not hired pursuant to a contract of employment, but rather was engaged as an independent contractor, pursuant to an oral contract, to perform piecework. He reported to Dave Croft, and was paid at a rate of $22.00 per hour, which amount was not subject to source deductions. Mr. Cavanagh was not entitled to any employment benefits or overtime pay, and the contract could be terminated by either party, on two weeks\u2019 notice. Mr. Cavanagh worked between 50 and 60 hours per week at Triple K until he left the company in November of 2001. He has since been rehired by Triple K as an employee, and now works in a managerial capacity, supervising the night shift\n[28] Contracting out the work proved to be an efficient method of handling vehicle maintenance, according to Mr. Sabiston. More than half of Triple K\u2019s maintenance work is now contracted out.\n[29] Although there continued to be a lot of work for the maintenance staff to do at Triple K, continuing poor business conditions ultimately forced the company to lay off five out of eleven maintenance personnel. In early December, 2001, Don Greenough and Ted Letts, and three other individuals were laid off. Mr. Sabiston says that one employee was recalled, but was unavailable for work, whereas Mr. Croft seems to say that no one was recalled. It is common ground that by March of 2002, the employment of all five employees was terminated.\n[30] Mr. Sabiston testified that Triple K has willingly accommodated disabled employees. He described cases where drivers with substance abuse problems were provided with rehabilitation services, as well as situations where maintenance workers with hand or wrist injuries were provided with modified duties. Mr. Croft testified that Mr. Milano\u2019s driving restrictions did not present the company with any difficulty, as other mechanics were able to drive the trucks when required. Mr. Croft also denied treating Mr. Milano any differently after he returned to work after having had his seizure.\nIII. The Law [31] Mr. Milano\u2019s complaint is brought pursuant to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 7 makes it a discriminatory practice to refuse to continue to employ an individual because of a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 3 of the Act designates disability as a prohibited around of discrimination.\n[32] In a case of this nature, the burden of proof is on Mr. Milano to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Once that is done, the burden shifts to Triple K to provide a reasonable explanation for the conduct in issue.[2]\n[33] A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made, and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in Mr. Milano's favour in the absence of an answer from Triple K.[3]\n[34] In the employment context, a prima facie case has been described as requiring proof of the following elements:\nthat the complainant was qualified for the particular employment; that the complainant was not hired [or, as in this case, was terminated], and that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint (ie: race, colour etc.) subsequently obtained the position.[4]\n[35] While the Shakes test serves as a useful guide, the test should not be automatically applied in a rigid or arbitrary fashion in every employment case: rather the circumstances of each case should be considered to determine if the application of the test, in whole or in part, is appropriate. Ultimately, the question will be whether Mr. Milano has satisfied the O\u2019Malley test, that is: if believed, is the evidence before me complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in Mr. Milano\u2019s favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent?[5]\n[36] If Triple K does provide a reasonable explanation for otherwise discriminatory behaviour, Mr. Milano then has the burden of demonstrating that the explanation was pretextual, and that the true motivation behind Triple K's actions was, in fact, discriminatory.[6]\n[37] The jurisprudence recognizes the difficulty in proving allegations of discrimination by way of direct evidence. As was noted in Basi:\nDiscrimination is not a practice which one would expect to see displayed overtly, in fact, there are rarely cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practiced. (at p. D\/5038).\n[38] Rather, it is the task of the Tribunal to consider all of the circumstances to determine if there exists what was described in the Basi case as the subtle scent of discrimination.\n[39] The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. In cases of circumstantial evidence, the test may be formulated as follows: An inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences of hypotheses.[7]\n[40] It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient if Mr. Milano\u2019s disability was a factor in Triple K\u2019s decision to terminate Mr. Milano\u2019s employment.[8]\nIV. Analysis A. Is there a prima facie case of discrimination? [41] In this case, Mr. Milano was hired by Triple K, and it is common ground that Mr Milano was an experienced and competent mechanic, and that no concerns arose with respect to his performance during the period that he worked at the company. Mr. Milano suffered a seizure while at work. Triple K concedes that Mr. Milano\u2019s epilepsy constitutes a disability. A few weeks later, Mr. Milano\u2019s employment with Triple K was terminated. Immediately thereafter, Luke Cavanagh began working at Triple K, performing mechanic\u2019s duties.\n[42] Triple K contends that Mr. Milano and the Commission have failed to establish a prima facie case, as the position that Luke Cavanagh was hired to fill was not the position occupied by Mr. Milano. Mr. Milano was hired to perform ongoing or preventative maintenance. That position was not filled after Mr. Milano\u2019s employment was terminated. Luke Cavanagh was retained to perform a different job - that is, the refurbishment of the Triple K trailers. As a consequence, Triple K says, the the third element of the Shakes test has not been made out, and the complaint should be dismissed.\n[43] As will be explained in greater detail further on in this decision, I am not persuaded that Luke Cavanagh worked primarily on the refurbishment of trailers. It is clear from the time records entered into evidence at the hearing that Mr. Cavanagh did work on Triple K trailers. Like other Triple K Service Technicians, however, Mr. Cavanagh also did a lot of work on tractors. I am also not satisfied that the task of refurbishing trailers is one that is sufficiently different from the tasks performed by Triple K Service Technicians that it should be considered to be a different position, within the meaning of the Shakes test.\n[44] In 2000, Mr. Milano had over thirty years of experience in automobile and truck mechanics, and as well, had provincial certification entitling him to repair automobiles, heavy duty equipment, motor coaches and trucks. In contrast, Luke Cavanagh finished technical high school in 1991, and had, at most, twelve years of experience as a mechanic, including several years of part-time work while he was attending high school. Mr. Cavanagh had his provincial licence to repair automobiles, motor coaches and trucks, but did not have his heavy duty equipment licence. Both individuals had experience working on trucks and trailers at Triple K, and both were viewed as competent employees. For reasons that will be discussed more fully in the next section of this decision, I am not persuaded that Luke Cavanagh\u2019s more extensive Triple K experience made him better qualified than Mr. Milano to refurbish Triple K\u2019s trailers.\n[45] Mr. Cavanagh described himself as 100% healthy. Unlike Mr. Milano, Mr. Cavanagh is not disabled, did not have a seizure in the workplace, and had no restrictions on his ability to drive.\n[46] In my view, the above facts are sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability, thus shifting the burden to Triple K, to provide an explanation.\nB. Is Triple K\u2019s Explanation Reasonable or Pretextual? [47] Triple K submits that it was required to let Mr. Milano go because of a downturn in the business, submitting that this was part of a downsizing exercise that had started in 1999, which continued through to the end of 2001. The fact that Mr. Milano suffered from epilepsy, and had had a seizure at work, played no part in the decision to terminate his employment. Triple K further contends that Luke Cavanagh was engaged as an independent contractor, as part of an effort to out-source or contract-out maintenance work. Triple K further contends that Mr. Cavanagh was retained to perform a particular task, that is, to refurbish the group of twenty trailers, and that he was particularly well-qualified for this task.\n[48] I accept that Triple K let four office staff go in 1999. However, I do not accept that these terminations represented the start of an ongoing effort to downsize the company. On July 28, 2000, Mr. Sabiston circulated a memo to Triple K staff, entitled: Company Campaign to Recruit. According to Mr. Sabiston\u2019s memo, the company was recruiting to fill positions in all three areas of the organization - drivers, mechanics and administrative staff. Mr. Sabiston noted that employees could be of tremendous assistance to the company in its efforts to recruit additional staff, and asked that employees spread the word that Triple K was hiring. He concluded by noting that:\n... the company presently sits with 70 people in three areas:\nDrivers 48\nMechanics 12\nFront office 10\n70 people\nWhere the company should be:\nDrivers 56\nMechanics 16\nFront office 10\n82 people\nMr. Sabiston concludes by noting that the company was looking to hire 8 drivers and 4 mechanics.\n[49] There is at least some evidence to suggest that it was the circulation of this memo that led Don Greenough to suggest that Mr. Milano apply to work at Triple K. Indeed, the fact that Mr. Milano was hired by Triple K in October of 2000 is evidence of the fact that, at least at that point, the company was not trying to eliminate positions in the maintenance shop.\n[50] Triple K further submits that financial pressure forced the company to eliminate overtime, in an effort to contain costs. A review of Triple K\u2019s time sheets confirms that the amount of paid overtime did go down, starting in late February of 2001. However, it will be recalled that Mr. Cavanagh was to work up to 60 hours a week, without collecting overtime pay. When the hours that he worked over and above a regular 40 hour week are taken into account, it appears that there was no significant reduction in the total number of hours worked in the repair shop.\n[51] Mr. Cavanagh was not entitled to employment benefits. Further, he did not get paid overtime, whereas regular Triple K employees got time and a half for hours worked over the 40 hour limit. As a consequence, Triple K may have realized a small cost saving through the hiring of Mr. Cavanagh. From this saving, however, one would have to set off the additional cost to the company incurred as a result of the higher hourly rate paid to Mr. Cavanagh for the first forty hours he worked each week.\n[52] At the end of the day, Triple K gained very little from a financial perspective through the engagement of Mr. Cavanagh.\n[53] It is common ground that some of Mr. Cavanagh\u2019s time was taken up with the refurbishment of Triple K trailers. A review of the available time sheets for Mr. Cavanagh discloses, however, that he did not just work on trailers, but also worked on trucks. I was only provided with Mr. Cavanagh\u2019s time records for the last three months that he worked for Triple K as an independent contractor. These records indicate that, for example, during the week ending September 1, 2001, Mr. Cavanagh worked on a trailer for 10 hours, but spent 46.50 hours working on Triple K trucks. Similarly, during the week ending October 20, Mr. Cavanagh worked a total of 45.50 hours, with more than 21 hours being spent on truck repairs. Three weeks later, Mr. Cavanagh worked a total of 51.25 hours, at least 39.75 hours of which were spent on truck repairs. As a result, Triple K has not persuaded me that Mr. Cavanagh worked primarily on the refurbishment of trailers.\n[54] Further, I do not accept that Mr. Milano could not have done this work. Mr. Cavanagh had previously worked at Triple K for ten months, whereas Mr. Milano had worked at the company for just over three months.[9] However, Mr. Milano had far more extensive professional experience than did Mr. Cavanagh, and, as well, had superior professional qualifications.\n[55] Much was made at the hearing by Triple K of Mr. Milano\u2019s confusion in his testimony as to the number of axles on Triple K trailers, the suggestion being that this demonstrated his unfamiliarity with the trailers. Given that more than two years have passed since Mr. Milano worked at Triple K, I am not prepared to conclude from this that Mr. Milano did not have a sufficient degree of familiarity with Triple K trailers to do the refurbishment work.\n[56] Dave Croft testified that because of the specialized nature of Triple K\u2019s tractors and trailers, it took even an experienced mechanic a year to become familiar with Triple K\u2019s equipment. Nevertheless, Mr. Cavanagh was hired to do this ostensibly very demanding job, without any supervision, with only ten months of Triple K experience. On this point, I prefer the testimony of Del Higginson, who stated that within a month of commencing work at Triple K, a mechanic would be up to speed on the nuances of Triple K\u2019s procedures and equipment. In concluding that Mr. Higginson\u2019s testimony should be preferred over that of Mr. Croft, I have taken into account the fact that Mr. Higginson resigned from Triple K because of a fundamental disagreement with the way that things were being done at the company, and that there is clearly no love lost between Mr. Higginson and Triple K management. Nevertheless, I found Mr. Higginson to have been a balanced and fair witness, and prefer his evidence on this point to that of Mr. Croft.\n[57] Ted Letts and Don Greenough both testified that the work that Luke Cavanagh did refurbishing the trailers was work that any of the Triple K mechanics could do. I have some concerns about the reliability of these individuals\u2019 testimony, particularly that of Mr. Letts, as both Mr. Letts and Mr. Greenough were clearly bitter at having been laid off by Triple K in December of 2001. As a consequence, I would be reluctant to rely exclusively on their testimony on this point. However, Del Higginson, who I have previously found to be a reliable witness, was emphatic that Mr. Milano possessed the necessary skill and experience to do the refurbishment job. Mr. Higginson supervised Mr. Milano for the four months that he worked at Triple K. Mr. Higginson was thus in the best position to assess whether Mr. Milano could have done the work that Luke Cavanagh performed.\n[58] Even if Triple K really believed that Mr. Milano did not have the requisite expertise to refurbish the trailers, there were other mechanics working at Triple K with years of company experience, who could have worked on the trailers. Mr. Sabiston testified that the company had tried having the work done by Triple K employees, but they ended up getting distracted by other, more pressing work, and the trailer work did not get done. Triple K claims that Mr. Cavanagh was retained to work exclusively on the refurbishment of the trailers, however, as was previously noted, Mr. Cavanagh\u2019s time records demonstrate clearly that his efforts were not confined to the refurbishment of Triple K trailers.\n[59] Mr. Sabiston and Mr. Croft both testified that Mr. Milano\u2019s employment was terminated in February of 2001 because of the downturn in Triple K\u2019s business. For the same reason, in December of 2001, the company let five more employees go. However, these individuals were laid off, with the possibility of recall, and with their Records of Employment indicating the reason for their lay-off as being shortage of work. In contrast, in Mr. Milano\u2019s case, his employment was terminated, with no possibility that he would be called back to work. Although Mr. Croft was asked why Mr. Milano was treated differently from the other employees in this regard, I was not provided with a satisfactory explanation for this differential treatment. The obvious conclusion to be drawn from this is that Triple K no longer wanted to have Mr. Milano working at the company.\n[60] It is also noteworthy that Triple K attempted to justify the selection of Mr. Milano for termination in February of 2001, on the basis that he was the last man to have been hired, suggesting that the company used a seniority-based system.[10] However, Mr. Sabiston and Mr. Croft agreed that seniority played no role in their choice of individuals to be laid-off ten months later.\n[61] I accept that Triple K did come under financial pressure as a result of the depressed condition of the steel industry, and that this may have been a major factor in the lay-off of the five mechanics in December of 2001. However, when the evidence is viewed as a whole, Triple K has not persuaded me that the termination of Mr. Milano\u2019s employment some ten months earlier was caused entirely by the poor financial condition of the company. In February of 2001, Triple K clearly did not want Mr. Milano working there any more. Why was that? Given the company\u2019s admission that Mr. Milano\u2019s performance on the job was satisfactory, the only logical conclusion is that Triple K did not want to have an epileptic working in the maintenance shop.\n[62] As a result, I find that the explanation offered by Triple K for the termination of Mr. Milano\u2019s employment in February of 2001 is pretextual. Luke Cavanagh was clearly highly regarded by Mr. Sabiston and Mr. Croft. It may well be that their desire to free up a position in the maintenance shop, to allow Mr. Cavanagh to return to Triple K, played a role in the decision to terminate Mr. Milano\u2019s employment. Nevertheless, on all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the fact that Mr. Milano suffered from epilepsy, and suffered a seizure in the workplace, was a significant factor in the decision to terminate his employment. For these reasons, Mr. Milano\u2019s complaint is sustained\nV. Remedy [63] Having found liability on the part of Triple K, it remains to be determined what, if any, remedy should properly be provided. In fashioning a remedy, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is governed by section 53 of the Act, which contemplates the imposition of remedies designed to prevent future acts of discrimination, as well as compensation for individual complainants. The goal of compensation in cases of discrimination is to make whole the victim of the discriminatory practice, taking into account principles of mitigation, reasonable foreseeability and remoteness.[11]\nA. Systemic Remedy [64] The Commission asks that I order Triple K to cease discriminating against disabled employees, and to consult with the Commission with respect to its policy relating to the treatment of its disabled employees. The Commission further asks that Triple K management be required to undergo training to sensitize them to the need to accommodate disabled employees.\n[65] Given that one of the remedial aims of the Canadian Human Rights Act is to prevent future recurrences of discriminatory practices, such an order is, in my view, appropriate in the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, I order that Triple K cease discriminating against disabled employees. Triple K is further ordered to consult with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in order to develop a policy with respect to the accommodation of employees who suffer from disabilities. Within 3 months of the publication of the accommodation policy, Triple K shall also provide its senior management with training on the workings of the policy, and the obligations of employers with respect to disabled employees, including the duty to accommodate.\nB. Lost Wages [66] Mr. Milano seeks payment of the wages that he lost from the last day that he worked at Triple K, that is, February 23, 2001, until he became re-employed on a full-time basis in February of 2003, less any income that he received from casual employment in the interim period. In my view, Mr. Milano should be compensated for the wages and employment benefits that he lost in the period from February 23, 2001, to December 3, 2001.\n[67] In November of 2001, Mr. Cavanagh\u2019s contract was terminated by Triple K. On December 3, 2001, the company laid off five mechanics out of a total mechanical staff of eleven. The Commission and Mr. Milano contend that this lay-off was an attempt by Triple K to houseclean, that is, to rid the company of employees that were perceived to be malcontents. There is some evidence to support this view, given that several of the individuals who were laid- off had just had a confrontation with management about practices at the company. Further, in the Spring of 2002, just a few weeks after the end of the recall period, Triple K was advertising to hire more mechanics.\n[68] Whatever the company\u2019s reasons were for selecting these particular individuals for lay- off, as I have previously indicated, I accept that the company was in some financial difficulty in this period, and that this led to the lay-offs, as well as the termination of Mr. Cavanagh\u2019s contract. Had Mr. Milano been working at Triple K in December of 2001, I am satisfied that he would, in all probability, have been laid-off at that time. To the extent that seniority could have been taken into account in the selection of candidates for lay-off, Mr. Milano was the most junior employee. If Triple K was indeed laying-off employees who were perceived as too outspoken, as Mr. Milano and the Commission contend, Mr. Milano may well have fit into this category. Mr. Milano is clearly a very intelligent man, one who is not afraid to stand up for himself. Indeed, it was clear from Mr. Milano\u2019s very effective cross-examinations during the hearing that he is not afraid to challenge those with whom he disagrees. Given the prevailing corporate culture at Triple K, by December of 2001, I find that Mr. Milano would, in all probability, have been identified for lay- off.\n[69] Accordingly, I award Mr. Milano the wages and employment benefits that he lost in the period from February 23, 2001, to December 3, 2001, less any income earned by him from other sources during this period. In the event that the parties are unable to come to an agreement with respect to the monies owing to Mr. Milano under the terms of this decision, I may be spoken to.\n[70] Had it not been for the discriminatory conduct of Triple K, Mr. Milano would not have been required to attend at this hearing. Having regard to the remedial goal of making a successful complainant whole, Mr. Milano should also be compensated for the wages that he lost as a result of his attendance at the hearing, which he testified amount to $720.\nC. Gross Up [71] Mr. Milano is currently working. In addition to the wages that he is earning through his new employment, he will now be entitled to a lump sum payment on account of wages. This may well result in negative income tax consequences for him. In my view, it would unfairly penalize Mr. Milano if he were to suffer a more onerous income tax burden, by receiving a lump sum payment now, than he would have incurred had the monies been paid to him as salary in 2001. This would be inconsistent with the remedial goal of making Mr. Milano whole. Accordingly, Triple K shall pay Mr. Milano an additional amount sufficient to cover any additional income tax liability that he incurs as a consequence of receiving payment in this fashion.\nD. Out of Pocket Expenses [72] In preparation for this hearing, Mr. Milano paid $45 to obtain copies of his medical records. He should be reimbursed for this expenditure.\n[73] Further, with the assistance of his son, Mr. Milano retained the Ottawa law firm of Nelligan, O\u2019Brien, Payne to assist him in the pursuit of his human rights complaint. Nelligan\u2019s has charged a total of $11,248.26 for its services in relation to this matter, inclusive of disbursements and GST.\n[74] There is a conflict in the jurisprudence emanating from the Federal Court on the question of the jurisdiction of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to award a successful complainant his reasonable legal expenses.[12] For the reasons that I gave in Nkwazi v. Correctional Service of Canada[13] and Premakumar v. Air Canada,[14] I am of the view that there are compelling policy considerations that favour adopting the interpretation of Section 53 (2) (c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act espoused by Gibson J. in Thwaites and Rouleau J. in Stevenson, that is, to conclude that the ordinary usage of the word expenses includes legal expenses.\n[75] In my view, in order to satisfy the remedial goal of making Mr. Milano whole, an order requiring that he be reimbursed for his reasonable legal expenses is appropriate in this case. In the event that the parties cannot agree on an appropriate figure for Mr. Milano\u2019s legal expenses, I may be spoken to.\nE. Pain and Suffering [76] Mr. Milano asks for an award of $20,000 - the maximum permissible under the Act - for the pain and suffering that he says that he sustained as a consequence of his employment having been terminated by Triple K.\n[77] Mr. Milano testified that he was shattered by the actions of Triple K, and described in some detail the devastating consequences that the company\u2019s actions had for his self-esteem and emotional well-being. He testified that he had considerable difficulty finding another job, given the fact that he did not have a valid driver\u2019s licence, and explained the severe financial difficulties that he sustained as a result.\n[78] While Mr. Milano testified that he was very depressed as a result of losing his job at Triple K, there is no indication that Mr. Milano was required to seek medical assistance to deal with this problem, and he appears to have made a complete recovery.\n[79] In all of the circumstances, an award of $10,000 for Mr. Milano\u2019s pain and suffering is appropriate.\nF. Special Compensation [80] Mr. Milano also seeks an award of $20,000 as special compensation for what he says is Triple K\u2019s wilful and reckless conduct.\n[81] I have already concluded that Triple K wilfully terminated Mr. Milano\u2019s employment at least in part because he suffered from epilepsy. Nevertheless, what occurred in this case appears to be an isolated incident. Mr. Milano was provided with a letter of reference by Triple K, and was allowed to stay for an extra week on top of the two weeks of working notice originally provided by Mr. Croft. Further, unlike the majority of federally-regulated employers, Triple K is not a large organization. In my opinion, in all of the circumstances, an award of $5,000 is appropriate here.\nG. Interest [82] Interest is payable on awards of special compensation as well as on lost wages.[15] I order interest be paid on the monies awarded pursuant to this decision, in accordance with Rule 9 (12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure. Interest should run from February 23, 2001, and, in the case of the lost wages, should be calculated as the wages would have become payable to Mr. Milano.\nH. Retention of Jurisdiction [83] I will retain jurisdiction in the event that the parties are unable to agree with respect to the quantification or implementation of any of the remedies awarded under this decision.\nVI. Order [84] For the foregoing reasons, I declare that Mr. Milano\u2019s rights under the Canadian Human Rights Act have been contravened by Triple K, and order that:\nTriple K cease discriminating against disabled employees. Triple K is further ordered to consult with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 (2) (a) of the Act, in order to develop a policy with respect to the accommodation of disabled employees. Within 3 months of the publication of the accommodation policy, Triple K shall also provide its senior management with training on the workings of the policy, and the obligations of employers with respect to disabled employees, including the duty to accommodate. Mr. Milano be awarded compensation for lost wages, calculated in accordance with this decision; Triple K pay to Mr. Milano an amount sufficient to cover any additional income tax liability that he may incur as a consequence of receiving the monies referred to above in this fashion; Triple K pay $10,000 to Mr. Milano for his pain and suffering; Triple K pay Mr. Milano the sum of $5,000 as special compensation; Interest shall be paid on the lost wages and non-pecuniary compensation awarded pursuant to this decision, in accordance with Rule 9 (12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure. Interest on the lost wages shall run from February 23, 2001, and shall be calculated in accordance with this decision.\nSigned by\nAnne Mactavish Chairperson\nOttawa, Ontario September 12, 2003\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T732\/3702\nStyle of Cause: Victor Milano v.

Further, regard should be had to the testimony of Mr. Cavanagh that he may not have been as productive as other mechanics during those ten months, because of his inexperience, whereas Mr. Milano was able to jump right in and complete whatever tasks he was called upon to perform.\n[10] The Commission tried to argue that Mr. Milano was not, in fact, the last person hired in the maintenance area. While it is true that others came to work in the maintenance shop at Triple K after Mr. Milano started at the company, none of these individuals were hired to do the same type of work as either Mr. Milano or Mr. Cavanagh. As a result, I am satisfied that Mr. Milano was indeed the last mechanic to have been hired by Triple K prior to February of 2001.\n[11] See Canada (Attorney General) v.

INTRODUCTION [1] The Panel is seized of two preliminary issues raised by the respondent, TELUS Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., (the respondent) in respect of a complaint filed July 8, 1999, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) by the Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Section locale 5044 du Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (the complainant).\n[2] In its complaint, the complainant alleges that the respondent discriminates against the incumbents of a female-dominated job in its employ. According to the complainant, in so doing, the respondent is in contravention of section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[3] The issues raised by the respondent are as follows:\nThe respondent maintains that certain parties, including the Syndicat des Agents de Ma\u00eetrise de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Section locale 5144 du Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (the SAQT), ought to be summoned in the context of this case as their interests could potentially be directly affected by the findings of the Tribunal; The respondent maintains that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant the Commission's decision to request the appointment of this Tribunal.\n[4] On March 26, 2003, Mr. Athanasios D. Hadjis, a member of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, determined that these two issues would be dealt with through written arguments. The undersigned was designated to dispose of both these issues.\nII. THE FIRST ISSUE [5] It should be pointed out straightaway that the first issue raised by the respondent consists of several elements..\n[6] Firstly, the respondent requests that the SAQT be duly summoned for the purposes of this case (Respondent's written submissions of April 15, 2003, para. 26). The respondent asserts that the SAQT is an interested party whose rights could be affected by a decision of the Tribunal in this case (Submissions, para. 46). The respondent therefore requests that the SAQT be notified that any decisions the Tribunal might hand down in this case are likely to affect its rights, so as to permit it to present its defence or its viewpoint (Written Submissions, para. 47).\n[7] Secondly, the respondent argues that, should the Tribunal make a finding of any discrimination whatsoever in this case, both the complainant and the SAQT should be held liable for damages as active and essential agents of the alleged discrimination (Written Submissions, para. 38).\n[8] According to the respondent, the job in question was evaluated by a joint standing job evaluation committee composed of representatives of the complainant, the respondent and the SAQT (Written Submissions, para. 34); according to the respondent, if discrimination is found to exist, it is the result of the decision of the committee, a decision that was final and not subject to review and was binding on the respondent (Written Submissions, para. 43).\n[9] Consequently, the respondent asserts that the representatives of the complainant and those of the SAQT who sat on the joint committee charged with evaluating the jobs in question should be held jointly and severally liable for any compensation the Tribunal might order in this case (Written Submissions, para. 44).\n[10] The respondent therefore requests that the SAQT be summoned for the purposes of this case by an impleading, in view of its active and essential role in the alleged discrimination, and asserts that its presence is necessary to permit a complete resolution of the dispute (Written Submissions, para. 51)..\n[11] In response to the respondent's arguments, the Commission states that it takes no stand on the merits of this issue. It requests, however, that the third party be notified of the preliminary objection so that it can make representations on the merits of the objection.\n[12] The complainant, for its part, argues that the Tribunal is seized of no complaint filed by the SAQT, that the evaluation of the job related to the SAQT, namely, that of small business representative, is not at all in dispute.\n[13] Out of concern for procedural fairness, the Tribunal called for the SAQT to be notified of the respondent's application to summon and implead an additional party and be invited to submit its representations to the Tribunal. The SAQT had until August 4, 2003, to make its representations.\n[14] As of the date of this decision, the Tribunal still had not received any representations from the SAQT, even though a letter of reminder was sent. The Tribunal is therefore required to render its decision on the first issue based on the representations of the Commission, the complainant and the respondent.\nIII. DECISION ON THE FIRST ISSUE [15] Regarding the first issue, the Panel believes it should be pointed out that the respondent's position is somewhat ambiguous. Firstly, the respondent asked that the SAQT be duly summoned, which was done in this case, to present its viewpoint on the respondent's applications in its regard. Secondly, the respondent asked that the SAQT be impleaded.\n[16] The Panel is of the opinion that this application to implead a third party goes well beyond the sending of a notice to appear and respect for the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness. It is intended to make the SAQT a respondent party to the Tribunal's inquiry into the complaint and not just an interested party.\n[17] In support of its claims in respect of the first issue, the respondent refers to the decision handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada in Renaud v. Board of School Trustees, School District No. 23 (Central Okanagan) and the Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 523, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970.\n[18] It should be pointed out that the facts in the Renaud case differ appreciably from those in the present case. In Renaud, the plaintiff had filed a complaint against both the employer and his union, which is not the case here. At the hearing of the complaint, the assigned member amended the complaint of which he was seized to include a claim against the union under another section of the Act as well as that brought under the initial section, in order to bring the initial complaint into conformity with the nature of the proceedings. The assigned member justified his decision by the fact that no prejudice would be suffered by the union as a result of the amendment as the union had been represented throughout the proceedings and had fully taken part in the initial complaint, which is not the case here. The Supreme Court confirmed the validity of the decision of the designated member to hear the complaint.\n[19] The Act does not provide any procedure as such for the forced addition of parties and interested persons in a proceeding before the Tribunal. At most, paragraph (b) of subsection 48.9(2) of the Act states as follows:\nThe Chairperson may make rules of procedure governing the practice and procedure before the Tribunal, including, but not limited to, rules governing ( )\n(b) the addition of parties and interested persons to the proceedings; (...)\n[20] Moreover, the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure require the following, under the heading Addition of Interested Parties:\nApply by way of motion for status\n8(1) Anyone who is not a party, and who wishes to be recognized by the Panel as an interested party in respect of an inquiry may bring a motion in writing for an order granting interested party status.\nMotion to specify grounds\n8(2) A motion under 8(1) shall specify the grounds invoked in support of the request for status and the extent of the desired participation in the inquiry.\n[21] On reading this rule, one notes that it is not aimed specifically at the impleading of a third party by one of the parties to an inquiry into a complaint by the Tribunal, namely, the complainant, the Commission or the respondent. Nothing is said, moreover, of the Tribunal's power to allow a third party to be brought in, with the legal effects entailed by such a procedure.\n[22] This being said, if the Act states that the Chairperson may make rules of procedure governing, notably, the addition of parties and interested persons to a proceeding, it is logical to think that the Tribunal has the power to add parties to a given proceeding. For the time being, the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure contain no stipulation to this effect.\n[23] In an oral decision rendered on October 2, 2002, in Desormeaux v. OC Transpo (T701\/0602), the Chair of the Tribunal, who was seized of an application to add a union as a respondent, ruled that under section 50 of the Act, the Tribunal has the power to add individuals or groups as interested persons in the context of a hearing (our underlining). She pointed out, however, that in the case in point, this was not the issue put to her, the issue to be decided being, rather, whether a third party (a party not involved in the complaint) could be added as a respondent, with the effects this could have with regard to its liability.\n[24] On this point, the Chair of the Tribunal concluded, relying on paragraph (b) of subsection 48.9(2) of the Act, that the legislator's intent was to vest in the Tribunal the power to add parties as well as interested persons to a proceeding before the Tribunal.\n[25] Moreover, in a subsequent oral decision rendered on October 3, 2002, in the same Desormeaux case, the Chair of the Tribunal ruled that in the case in point, the circumstances did not warrant the addition of the union as a respondent. She ruled that, while it had previously been found that the Act vests in the Tribunal the power to add parties to a proceeding when the Tribunal deems it appropriate, the legislative context surrounding this discretionary power argues for a measure of restraint or caution (the term used by the Chair).\n[26] In this regard, the Chair of the Tribunal points out, most aptly in our view, that the Act provides, in dealing with complaints of discrimination, a carefully developed process of investigation and inquiry in which both the Commission and the Tribunal have clearly defined roles.\n[27] In her decision, the Chair of the Tribunal mentions the fact that the addition of parties during a proceeding before the Tribunal deprives the new respondent of the benefit of certain means of defence it can normally present at the stage of the screening of a complaint by the Commission, notably the possibility of having the complaint dismissed without the need for the Tribunal to institute an inquiry, for example because the complaint was filed after the period of one year stipulated in the Act.\n[28] Moreover, in a decision rendered by the Tribunal on November 27, 2002, in Bozek and Canadian Human Rights Commission v. MCL Ryder Transport Inc. and McGill (T716\/2102 and T717\/2202), the Panel ordered, following an application in this regard by the Commission and the complainant, that the initial complaint be amended to substitute the name of the company born of the merger of the initial respondent with a number of other corporations in place of the name ofthe initial respondent.\n[29] As there exist no formal rules establishing the conditions in which the Tribunal may add a new respondent, and, moreover, as the Tribunal has the power to add a new respondent, the Chairperson having the power, under the Act, to make rules governing the addition of parties and interested persons to the proceedings, it is important for the Panel to review the criteria that should guide it in deciding whether to add a new respondent at the inquiry stage of the complaint before the Tribunal.\n[30] The Panel is of the opinion that the forced addition of a new respondent once the Tribunal has been charged with inquiring into a complaint is appropriate, in the absence of formal rules to this effect, if it is established that the presence of this new party is necessary to dispose of the complaint of which the Tribunal is seized and that it was not reasonably foreseeable, once the complaint was filed with the Commission, that the addition of a new respondent would be necessary to dispose of the complaint.\n[31] In the case in point, the reasons invoked by the respondent for impleading the SAQT and having it become a party in the inquiry into the complaint and not just an interested person, have to do essentially with the fact that two of its members were on the joint standing job evaluation committee (Written Submissions, para. 34 and 35) that evaluated the jobs in question.\n[32] This fact in itself does not at all mean that the two members of the SAQT bound the liability of their union by participating on the committee. Moreover, nothing in the documentation submitted to the Panel indicates that these members or the committee acted, or may have acted, in a discriminatory manner in evaluating the jobs.\n[33] It should be pointed out, moreover, that the report of the Commission's investigator submitted in evidence by the respondent in support of its claims, makes no reference at all to the SAQT and its involvement in evaluating the jobs in question.\n[34] Furthermore, the Panel cannot ignore the fact that for all intents and purposes, the addition of a new respondent at the stage of the Tribunal's inquiry into the complaint with no formal complaint having been brought against it deprives this new respondent of the opportunity to present certain grounds of defence before the Commission pursuant to sections 41 and 44 of the Act.\n[35] It should be pointed out in this regard that the courts recently underscored the importance of respect for procedural fairness in dealing with complaints of discrimination filed with the Commission, notably with regard to the respondent's right to dispute, at this initial stage, the merits of the complaint (Canada Post Corporation v. Barrette, [2000] 4 F.C. 145 (C.A.) and Judge v. Canada Post Corporation, [2002] F.C.A. no. 426 (F.C.T.D.).\n[36] In the case in point, the respondent has not satisfied the Panel that the forced impleading of the SAQT is necessary in order to dispose of the complaint as worded. Moreover, the Panel believes that the impleading of the SAQT at this stage would be prejudicial to it from a standpoint of procedural fairness.\n[37] This being said, it will be permissible for the respondent to assert during the hearing before the Tribunal that the evidence submitted to the Tribunal does not warrant the allowing of the complaint, and that it cannot be held liable or solely liable for the discrimination alleged in the complaint.\nIV. THE SECOND ISSUE [38] Regarding the second issue, the respondent, relying here on sections 41 and 44 of the Act, maintains that the Commission could not ask the Chair of the Tribunal, in application of section 49 of the Act, to assign a member to inquire into the complaint for the two reasons set out as follows in its written arguments of April 15, 2003:\n[Translation]\nregarding the first reason, the respondent, relying on the facts recorded in both the Investigation Report and in the complaint, argues that the complaint was filed more than one year after the last of the events on which it is based occurred, namely, the allocation of a different evaluation rating for business customer service representatives (BAR) than for small business representatives (PME); regarding the second reason, the respondent relies on the fact that the author of the investigation report recommends that, pursuant to section 44(3)(b) of the Act, that [sic] the Commission dismiss the complaint for various reasons.\n[39] The respondent therefore concludes that the Commission should have dismissed the complaint pursuant to paragraphs 41(1)(c) to (e) of the Act.\n[40] In response to the respondent's arguments, the Commission maintains that only the Federal Court has jurisdiction to review decisions of the Commission. The complainant says it shares the Commission's viewpoint.\n[41] In its rebuttal of the Commission's position, the respondent maintains that the scheme of the Act argues in favour of the review by the Tribunal of the sufficiency of the evidence on which the referral of the complaint to the Tribunal is based.\n[42] According to the respondent, the Commission's viewpoint has the effect of restricting the Tribunal's power to determine whether or not a complaint is substantiated under the Act (Respondent's written rebuttal, para. 25). Firstly, it undermines the Tribunal's power to examine whether or not there was sufficient evidence to warrant the Commission's decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal (Rebuttal, para. 26), and secondly, it restricts the Tribunal's power to determine whether or not a complaint ought to be dismissed for the reasons set out in section 41 of the Act (Rebuttal, para. 27).\n[43] In the respondent's view, the Tribunal is fully competent to decide the issue raised regarding insufficient evidence to warrant the inquiry into the complaint. What is more, the respondent maintains that this issue does not come, at this stage, under the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.\nV. DECISION ON THE SECOND ISSUE [44] The Panel intends to examine, in turn, each argument raised by the respondent regarding the expiry of the time period for consideration of the complaint by the Commission and insufficient evidence to warrant an inquiry into the complaint before the Tribunal.\nA. Late filing of the complaint [45] Under subsection 41(1) of the Act, the Commission is not required to rule on a complaint filed after the specified period of time. Paragraph 41(1)(e) of the Act stipulates that:\n41. (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that\n( )\n(e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.\n[46] This being said, the Commission can, nevertheless, rule on a complaint filed after the one-year period stipulated in paragraph 41(1)(e) of the Act (International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Marine Section), Local 400 v. Oster and Canadian Human Rights Commission and Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, [2002] 2 F.C. 430 (F.C.T.D.)). Under the Act, the Commission is not required to justify its decision. In fact, only if the Commission decides not to rule on a complaint on the ground that it is not receivable under subsection 41(1) of the Act is it required to send the reason for its decision in writing to the complainant, as subsection 42(1) of the Act stipulates.\n[47] Evidently, in the case in point, the Commission did not deem the complaint to be not receivable, having first assigned someone to investigate the complaint and having then referred it to the Tribunal. This being said, no reason is given for the Commission's decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal, if we rely on the Commission's letter to the respondent of December 24, 2002. It was not necessary to give one.\n[48] The Panel believes that it is not up to it to rule on the reasons that may have prompted the Commission to refer the present complaint to the Tribunal (Parisien and Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, Decision No. 1, Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, July 15, 2002, para. 12). The fact is that the Commission did refer the complaint to the Tribunal without, however, formally giving its reasons for doing so. Accordingly, the reasons that prompted the Commission to seize the Tribunal of the complaint despite the recommendation to the contrary formulated by the Commission's investigator, are not known to the Panel.\n[49] Be that as it may, it seems well established in case law that when the person against whom a complaint is made believes that the complaint was filed after the time limit, the person may raise this point before the Commission. As pointed out by Mr. Justice D\u00e9cary of the Federal Court of Appeal, in Canada Post Corporation v. Barrette, [2000] 4 F.C. 145, para. 24:\n[w]ith respect to the grounds set out in paragraphs 41(1)(a) to (e), a person against whom a complaint is made is expressly given two opportunities to raise them: one at the section 41 preliminary screening stage, the other at the section 44 screening stage (see paragraphs 44(2)(a) and (b) and subparagraphs 44(3)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii)).\n[50] In the case in point, there is nothing to indicate that the respondent argued its claims before the Commission as to the lateness of the complaint made against it. The respondent did, however, have two opportunities to do so.\n[51] Furthermore, if the respondent did not agree with the Commission's decision to refer this complaint to the Tribunal, it could have applied for judicial review before the Federal Court (International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Marine Section), Local 400 v. Oster and Canadian Human Rights Commission and Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, supra), which it seems it did not do. The comments of Mr. Justice Gibson in paragraph 30 of the above-cited decision certainly apply to the present case:\nThe Union, having decided not to seek judicial review before this Court of the Commission's discretionary decision to extend the time limit under paragraph 41(1)(e) of the Act, was simply precluded from adopting the alternative recourse that it chose, that being to raise precisely the same issues that it could have raised on judicial review, before the Tribunal.\n[52] The Panel therefore finds that the respondent's arguments regarding the late filing of the complaint are unsubstantiated.\nB. Insufficient evidence [53] It is relevant, to dispose of this issue, to examine the respective role and powers of the Commission and the Tribunal under the Act.\n1. The role and powers of the Commission [54] Under section 41 of the Act, the Commission has a duty to rule on any complaint of which it is seized, subject to the exceptions set out in paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection 41(1), as Mr.Justice D\u00e9cary of the Federal Court of Appeal points out in Canada Post Corporation v. Barrette, [2000] 4 F.C. 145, para. 23:\nSection 41 imposes a duty on the Commission to ensure, even proprio motu, that a complaint is worth being dealt with. There is obviously no duty to investigate at that stage and the Commission is asked no more than to examine on a prima facie basis whether the grounds set out in subsection 41(1) are present and, if so, to decide whether to nevertheless deal with the complaint.\n[55] Under section 43 of the Act, the Commission may designate a person to investigate a complaint. This being said, section 49 of the Act stipulates that the Commission may, at any stage after the filing of a complaint, request the Chairperson to institute an inquiry into the complaint if it is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n[56] Under the Act the Commission is not required to give reasons for its decision to request that the Tribunal inquire into a complaint. At most, section 42 of the Act requires the Commission to send written reasons to a complainant of its decision not to rule on a complaint that it considers, under the Act, not receivable.\n[57] Finally, under the Act the Commission is not required to act on the recommendation of the person charged with investigating a complaint pursuant to section 43 of the Act. The Commission has considerable discretion in this regard. Pursuant to section 44 of the Act, in deciding to ask the Tribunal to assign a member to inquire into a complaint that is the subject of an investigation report, the Commission must consider not only the investigation report, but also all the circumstances of the complaint.\n2. The role and powers of the Tribunal [58] The role vested in the Tribunal under the Act has been described, notably, as follows by Mr. Justice La Forest in Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 854, para. 64:\nTaken together, ss. 50(1) and 53(2) of the Act state that a tribunal shall inquire into the complaint referred to it by the Commission to determine if it is substantiated. This is primarily and essentially a fact-finding inquiry with the aim of establishing whether or not a discriminatory practice occurred. In the course of such an inquiry a tribunal may consider questions of law.\n[59] Thus, under the Act, the role of the Tribunal consists essentially in inquiring into any complaint referred to it by the Commission. Under section 50 of the Act, the Tribunal is empowered to decide all questions of law or fact relating to the complaint of which it is seized. In the context of the inquiry conducted by the Tribunal, the parties have the opportunity to present all arguments of fact and of law in support of their claims.\n[60] Upon completion of the inquiry into the complaint, the Tribunal may, under section 53 of the Act, either allow the complaint or dismiss it based on the evidence that has been presented and the applicable law.\n[61] Thus, according to the scheme of the Act, it is not up to the Tribunal in the context of the inquiry into a complaint to inquire about the reasons that warranted the referral of the complaint to the Tribunal. If a respondent does not agree with the Commission's decision to refer a complaint to the Tribunal despite a recommendation to the contrary from one of its investigators, then it must apply to the Federal Court.\n[62] Nor is it up to the Tribunal to decide whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant the Tribunal's inquiry into the complaint. The issue of the sufficiency of the evidence will be resolved upon completion of the Tribunal's inquiry into the complaint. The Tribunal will then have to determine whether the complaint, in view of the evidence presented and the applicable law, ought to be allowed or dismissed. In so doing, the Tribunal is not refusing to exercise its jurisdiction. It is merely respecting the scheme of the Act and adhering solely to the role vested in it by the Act.\n[63] In the final analysis, the ends of justice are better served if one adheres to the roles vested under the Act in the Commission and the Tribunal, and to the means provided by the legislator to appeal a decision with which one is not satisfied.\n[64] The Tribunal therefore finds that the respondent's arguments regarding insufficient evidence are unsubstantiated.\nVI. CONCLUSION [65] For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal therefore finds that the respondent's arguments in respect of the two preliminary issues submitted to the Tribunal are unsubstantiated. The inquiry into the complaint will therefore proceed as planned.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nSeptember 15, 2003\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE NO.: T757\/0703\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Section locale 5044 du SCFP v.

Hadjis\nI. FACTS\nII. ANALYSIS\nIII. ADJOURNMENT\n[1] The Respondent has filed a motion seeking an order confirming that the scope of the complaint that was referred to the Tribunal does not extend to all of the events mentioned in the complaint form.\nI. FACTS [2] The Complainant became a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1985. In the mid-1990's, the RCMP assigned the Complainant to serve on the United Nations Mission in Haiti as a United Nations Civil Police Force Officer (UNCIVPOL). She alleges in her complaint form, dated June 27, 1996, that while serving in Haiti in 1995, a disciplinary measure was taken against her that resulted in her early repatriation to Canada, before the scheduled completion of her assignment. She claims that this measure was taken as a result of her having entered into a personal relationship with another UNCIVPOL, serving on assignment to the mission from France. Upon her return to Canada, the RCMP initiated an internal investigation into her conduct. She alleges that she received treatment that differed from that which was allotted to other male UNCIVPOL who became involved in similar relationships while in Haiti. She contends that she was discriminated against on the basis of her sex as well as her family status (she was a married mother of one child at the time).\n[3] It is the Respondent's position that all RCMP staff transferred to UNCIVPOL duty are employed by the United Nations (UN) for the entire duration of their assignment and their employment is subject to the rules and regulations of the UN. In effect, the member states of the UN lend these police officers to the UN at the request of the UN's Secretary-General. These individuals are expected to conduct themselves solely in accordance with the interests of the UN and are not to accept any orders in the execution of their functions from their government or any other authority, apart from the UN. While on assignment on such missions, UNCIVPOL report to a Police Commissioner who is in turn accountable to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General designated for the mission. The Police Commissioner designated to serve on the Haitian mission was a member of the RCMP. The Respondent contends that any incidents occurring while the Complainant was working for the UN fall outside the scope of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act) and that neither the Commission nor the Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with the aspects of the complaint relating to those events. The RCMP made this position known to the Commission shortly after the RCMP was first informed that a human rights complaint had been filed against it, in a letter dated August 14, 1996, addressed to Marie Wankham, the Commission investigator assigned to examine the complaint.\n[4] On June 3, 1997, Ms. Wankham wrote to the RCMP that [TRANSLATION] we are of the opinion that the Commission has no jurisdiction to inquire into the aspect of the complaint relating to the discriminatory acts on the part of UN personnel. She pointed out, however, that the Commission has the authority to study those aspects of the complaint relating to the discriminatory conduct of the RCMP that is alleged to have taken place in Canada, specifically, the RCMP's decision to initiate an internal inquiry regarding the Complainant's conduct, upon her repatriation to Canada.\n[5] Over the next few years, the Commission's investigation was suspended while the Complainant exhausted her recourses internally within the RCMP. The Commission resumed its investigation thereafter, and a report by another investigator, Sylvie McNicoll, was released on October 8, 2002. The report reiterates that the Commission had already [TRANSLATION] determined that it did not have jurisdiction over the aspects of the complaint dealing with the alleged discriminatory conduct of UN personnel in Haiti. The document also states, in bold lettering, that the investigation report relates only to those allegations pertaining to the internal inquiry conducted by the RCMP within Canada.\n[6] On March 20, 2003, the Commission's Chief Commissioner sent a letter to the Chairperson of the Tribunal, informing her that the Commission was satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted. The institution of an inquiry into the complaint was therefore being requested. The letter of referral does not specify whether any aspect of the complaint did not warrant an inquiry or fell outside the jurisdiction of the Commission or the Tribunal.\n[7] The Respondent contends that upon receiving the Complainant's Notice of Factual and Legal Issues, in execution of her disclosure duties (Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure), it realized, to its surprise, that the Complainant intended to lead evidence with regard to the aspects of her complaint dealing with events that took place in Haiti. As a result, the Respondent filed the present motion, seeking an order to the effect that the only question remaining in issue before the Tribunal is the following: Was the decision by the RCMP to establish an internal investigation with respect to the Complainant based on prohibited grounds of discrimination, in contravention of the Act?\n[8] In essence, therefore, I am being asked to determine whether those aspects of the complaint that relate to the discriminatory conduct that is alleged to have occurred in Haiti were referred to the Tribunal for inquiry.\nII. ANALYSIS [9] It is evident that at various stages over the course of the Commission's investigation into the complaint, spanning a period of several years, certain representatives of the Commission were of the opinion that it had no jurisdiction to inquire into those aspects of the complaint relating to the conduct of UN personnel. It appears that before Ms. Wankham sent her June 3, 1997 letter to the RCMP, the views of several senior Commission employees were sought. A written legal opinion from the General Counsel of the Commission's Legal Services Branch was also obtained, although the Commission has withheld disclosure of this document claiming the ground of solicitor\/client privilege.\n[10] The Respondent contends that the Commission's conduct leading up to the referral of the complaint to the Tribunal forms an integral part of the actual decision to refer the matter. It is argued that in effect, the Commission already decided in 1997 that only the Canadian aspects of the complaint warranted further inquiry, a decision that is now binding on the Commission. The only aspects of the complaint that could subsequently be referred to the Tribunal are those relating to the RCMP's conduct after the Complainant's repatriation. All that the Respondent is currently requesting from the Tribunal is a clarification or confirmation that solely this more narrow aspect of the complaint was the object of the referral.\n[11] The Commission disagrees. Counsel for the Commission argued that the Respondent is effectively asking the Tribunal to review the Commission's decision to refer the entire complaint for inquiry. The Chief Commissioner's letter to the Tribunal Chairperson was explicit: an inquiry into the complaint was requested without any limitations or conditions added. Moreover, it is specified that the Commission's decision has been made having regard to all of the circumstances of the complaint. These circumstances, it is pointed out, are not just comprised of Ms. Wankham's letter and the subsequent investigation report, but also include correspondence from the Complainant objecting to the Respondent's contentions on the matter of the Commission's jurisdiction. In addition, the Commission submits that some of the documents relating to the UN mission in Haiti suggest that member states retained authority regarding the discipline of their police officers who were assigned to this mission. These documents were also before the Commission when it decided to refer the complaint to the Tribunal. If the Respondent does not agree with the Commission's decision to refer the entire complaint, it is free to seek review before the appropriate forum, the Federal Court.\n[12] In my opinion, it is evident from the Chief Commissioner's letter to the Tribunal Chairperson that all the aspects of the complaint, as set out in the complaint form that was signed by the Complainant in 1996, were referred to the Tribunal by the Commission. I do not find anything in the Chief Commissioner's letter from which to infer that less than the entire complaint was being sent on for inquiry by the Tribunal. Furthermore, one must not lose sight of the fact that although the Commission has the authority to decide whether a complaint is to be referred to the Tribunal (ss. 44(3) and 49 of the Act), the complaint continues to remain the complainant's, not the Commission's.1 The Complainant in the present case has never amended her complaint.\n[13] Implicit in the Respondent's motion is the proposition that due to the Commission's prior declared findings regarding the scope of the complaint, the Commission was no longer able to refer the entire complaint to the Tribunal. What the Respondent is therefore requesting amounts to having the Tribunal look behind the Commission's decision and review it in order to determine whether the Commission possessed the jurisdiction to make such a referral. The Tribunal does not exercise such supervisory jurisdiction over the actions and decisions of the Commission. This authority falls within the exclusive purview of the Federal Court,2 even in cases where the Commission's decision to refer runs contrary to the findings of its investigator.3\n[14] For these reasons, the order being sought by the Respondent is denied. I find that all the aspects of the complaint filed by the Complainant in 1996, have been referred to the Tribunal for inquiry, including the discriminatory conduct that is alleged to have occurred in Haiti.\nIII. ADJOURNMENT [15] The Respondent requests in its motion that in the event that the order being sought is not granted by the Tribunal, the hearing into the complaint be adjourned in order to allow the Respondent to amend its disclosure documents. The Respondent's motion was filed in the week preceding the scheduled start of the hearing into the merits of the complaint. The motion was argued before the Tribunal on the first of those scheduled hearing dates, September 17, 2003. During the course of the day, the parties agreed amongst themselves to a postponement of the hearing on the merits, for reasons that are to some extent unrelated to this motion. The new set of hearing dates has now been scheduled for a three-week period commencing on January 26, 2004.\n[16] Had the Complainant and the Commission been insistent on proceeding with the hearing on the merits immediately after the release of this ruling, I would have certainly granted the Respondent's request for an adjournment. Unquestionably, some confusion developed with regard to the scope of the complaint being referred to the Tribunal and I do not find the assumptions made by the Respondent to have been unreasonable. Indeed, in its written pleadings regarding the motion, the Commission consented to the Respondent's request for an adjournment, expressing its regret that the Respondent may have been led into error by the investigator's decision.\n[17] I find, however, that the four-month period leading up to the new hearing dates is sufficient to allow the Respondent to modify its disclosure documents and prepare its case, and I am therefore not ordering any further adjournment. The parties are encouraged to communicate with each other and determine the dates by which any additional disclosure of documents and information necessitated by the findings in the present ruling should occur. In the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement, any one of them should contact the Tribunal registry as soon as possible in order to have a conference call or other form of meeting with the Tribunal arranged.\nAthanasios D.

The Complainant, Lorraine Roch, and the Respondent, Ga\u00e9tan Maltais, did not make any submissions regarding this motion.\n[3] In its motion, the Respondent, Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e claims that, in this case, there is no nexus either in fact or law, between it and the Complainant. It also claims that it never approved, permitted, encouraged or tolerated the alleged actions of the Respondent Ga\u00e9tan Maltais. It claims that no legal nexus exists between it and Ga\u00e9tan Maltais. Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e argues that there is no allegation in the complaint accusing it of anything and that it cannot be held responsible for the actions or conduct of Ga\u00e9tan Maltais even though the latter was at one point a shareholder, administrator and officer of Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e.\n[4] The Tribunal, at this point in the procedure, is not required to rule on the validity or invalidity of the Respondent's allegations. The purpose of this motion is to decide whether to summarily dismiss the complaint against Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e.\n[5] To properly understand the Tribunal's jurisdiction for hearing such a motion for dismissal, it is necessary to refer to the legislative framework of the Canadian Human Rights Act1 including sections 41, 44, 49, 50 and 53. These sections provide for:\n41. (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that\nthe alleged victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complain relates ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available; the complaint is one that could more appropriately be dealt with, initially or completely, according to a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament other than this Act; the complaint is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission; the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith; or the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.\n[...]\n44. (1) An investigator shall, as soon as possible after the conclusion of an investigation submit to the Commission a report of the findings of the investigation...\n(3) On receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission\n(a) may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry under section 49 into the complaint to which the report related if the Commission is satisfied\n(i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted ...\n4) After receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission:\n(a) shall notify in writing the complainant and the person against whom the complaint was made of its action under subsection (2) or (3);\n[...]\n41.(1) Sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu'elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants:\nla victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de l'acte discriminatoire devrait \u00e9puiser d'abord les recours internes ou les proc\u00e9dures d'appel ou de r\u00e8glement des griefs qui sont normalement ouverts ;\nla plainte pourrait avantageusement \u00eatre instruite, dans un premier temps ou \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9tapes, selon des proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9vues par une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ; la plainte n'est pas de sa comp\u00e9tence ; la plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi ; la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai d'un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e, ou de tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n[...]\n44.

(1) After due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member...conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member...shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make presentations.\n[...]\n53. (1) At the conclusion of an inquiry, the member...conducting the inquiry shall dismiss the complaint if the member...finds that the complaint is not substantiated.\n(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member...finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member...may...make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice...\n[...]\n49. (1) La Commission peut, \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci, que l'instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n(2) Sur r\u00e9ception de la demande, le pr\u00e9sident d\u00e9signe un membre pour instruire la plainte....\n[...]\n50.

If the Commission decides to accept the complaint, it appoints an investigator to investigate into it.\n[7] The investigator files his or her report with the Commission as soon as possible after completing the investigation. Upon receipt of the report, the Commission, if it is satisfied that an inquiry into the complaint is warranted, may request the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint. The Commission informs the parties in writing of its decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal.\n[8] Upon receipt of the Commission's request, the Chairperson of the Tribunal shall institute an inquiry by assigning a member to inquire into the complaint. After due notice to the Commission and the parties, the member inquires into the complaint, giving the parties the opportunity to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the member may either dismiss the complaint if he or she finds it is not substantiated or make an order pursuant to 53(2) of the Act.\n[9] The motion for dismissal, in this case, asks the Tribunal to make an order that would set aside the Commission's decision to refer the complaint against the Respondent to the Tribunal for an inquiry. As we have just seen, according to the Act, it is the Commission that first decides if the complaint is to be dealt with and which, after reviewing the investigator's report, decides if it is justified and, if such is the case, refers the complaint to the Tribunal. Can the Tribunal, at this point in the procedure, interfere with the Commission exercising its discretion?\n[10] In Eyerley v. Seaspan International Limited, decided on August 2, 2000, the Chairperson of the Tribunal, Anne Mactavish, stated in paragraph 4:\nIt is not for this Tribunal to consider the jurisdiction or conduct of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. These matters are within the exclusive purview of the Trial Division of the Federal Court. Therefore, I have no intention of discussing the issue of Seaspan's challenge to the jurisdiction of the Commission.\n[11] Likewise, in International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Maritime Section), Local 400 v. Oster2, Mr. Justice Gibson stated the following:\nIn the result, I conclude that the Tribunal erred against a standard of correctness, in assuming jurisdiction with respect to the Union's preliminary objections. The Union, having decided not to seek judicial review before this Court of the Commission's discretionary decision to extend the time limit under paragraph 41(1)(e) of the Act, was simply precluded from adopting the alternative recourse that it chose, that being to raise precisely the same issues that it could have raised on judicial review, before the Tribunal.\n[12] As a result of the legislative framework described above and the cases cited, I am of the view that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to hear the motion of the Respondent, Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e. The appropriate recourse would have been for the Respondent to seek judicial review of the Commission's decision to deal with the complaint and to refer it to the Tribunal before the Federal Court. After the decision is made to refer the complaint to the Tribunal, the member assigned by the Chairperson will inquire into the complaint and will give the parties full and ample opportunity to appear, present evidence and make representations. He will then decide the questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter, including the issue of whether the Respondent, Ga\u00e9tan Maltais, has engaged in a discriminatory practice and if this practice, if so determined, was committed in the course of employment, as set out in section 65(1) of the Act. Again, in the event that it is determined that a discriminatory practice occurred and that this act was committed in the course of the employment of the Respondent (Ga\u00e9tan Maltais), the Respondent Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e may present evidence at the hearing to escape the application of this section and may present evidence to establish the exceptions set out in section 65(2).\n[13] The motion for dismissal filed by the Respondent, Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e, is therefore dismissed.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nOctober 22, 2003\n1.

Factual Background\nII. The Issue\nIII. The Evidence\nIV. Conclusion\nI. Factual Background [1] Nancy Green lodged a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in 1989 based on her view that she had not advanced in her career at the Respondent Department, Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC), because of the discriminatory practices of the Respondents.\n[2] After the allegations were investigated, a referral was made by the Commission to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. There was a hearing into the complaint. The June 26, 1998 decision of the Tribunal found that Ms. Green had been the victim of discriminatory practices by the Respondents. This decision was upheld, with minor changes, after a judicial review by the Federal Court (Trial Division).\n[3] In its decision, the Tribunal made a number of awards.\n[4] In 2000, Ms. Green received a lump sum award to compensate her for wages lost from 1989 to 2000. Additionally, in the same year, she received an award of interest on the lump sum award, to address her loss of opportunity to invest the monies which she ought to have received during the 1989-2000 time period.\n[5] The Commission had argued, in its submissions at the conclusion of the hearing on the substantive issues, that Nancy Green is entitled to a gross up to take into account any adverse income tax consequences arising from her receipt of lump sum compensation ... Nancy Green should not be required to pay any more income tax than she would have to pay had she been receiving the PM-6 income annually since 1988.\n[6] The Tribunal accepted the submission of both Ms. Green and Commission Counsel that remedial awards for Ms. Green should make her whole. In other words, the discriminatory practices of the Respondents should not cause Ms. Green to be in a position different from the position she would have found herself in, had she not been discriminated against.\n[7] In its decision, dated June 26, 1998, the Tribunal made an Order that the Parties find a figure, mutually approved by Ms Green and her department which would address the income tax implications of the decision. This figure was to represent the gross up. In this case, this is an additional amount of money, untaxed, which must be paid to Ms. Green, a victim of discrimination. It is meant to address adverse income tax implications which arise when remedial awards are made.\n[8] If such a mutually acceptable figure could not be found, the Tribunal noted in its decision that it would retain jurisdiction concerning the issue of the gross up. Any party could return to the Tribunal to ask that further information and evidence be received by the Tribunal to address the issue of the gross up and how it was calculated to take into consideration the income tax implications of the remedial Orders.\n[9] Ms. Green subsequently made that request, and the Tribunal has heard a number of days of viva voce evidence, including evidence of an expert witness, and has received a number of exhibits into evidence.\nII. The Issue [10] From Ms. Green\u2019s evidence, there is a necessity for someone [to tell her] that the actual income tax implications [of the remedial awards] have been considered. Having been presented with a lump sum amount to address her loss of income from 1989 to 2000, as well as an interest award, and a cheque (not taxable) in an amount which was simply marked gross up, with no explanation of its creation, Ms. Green wanted to know how the calculation of the gross up was made, what impacts on her income tax were considered when calculating the gross up, and what processes were used when the Respondents attempted to make her whole by the calculation of the gross up.\n[11] More specifically, the question to be answered is: Does the gross up, as calculated by the Respondents, represent a correct calculation of the amount to be awarded to Ms. Green to address the income tax implications of the remedial awards which were ordered as a result of the discriminatory practices of the Respondents?\nIII. The Evidence [12] Ms. Green presented a number of different scenarios which showed how the addition of the lump-sum award to her employment income for the year 2000 Income Tax Return, plus the interest award, created an unprecedented income tax return for her. Her evidence of basic income tax information from past years substantiated her contention that she was used to receiving a small income tax refund annually. She believed that this situation would continue, due to the remedial Order for a gross up to address the income tax implications of her receipt of monies pursuant to the Orders of the Tribunal. She even anticipated that, with an ability to make a substantial payment into her Registered Retirement Savings Plan, the 2000 income tax return would be more substantial than it had been in past years.\n[13] Ms. Green made a contribution into her Registered Retirement Savings Plan in an amount close to $30,000.00 after her receipt of the lump sum ordered by the Tribunal. This RRSP payment amount represented the room she had in her plan, as she had not made the maximum allowable contributions each year from 1989 to 2000. Based on her prior income tax assessments, she believed that such a payment would result in a considerable tax saving. She expected the refund for the year 2000 to amount to a value of about one-half of the RRSP contribution, or $15,000. Had she received no interest award, in the same year, 2000, she would have been correct. Her exhibit showing her calculations for the 2000 income tax return including her employment income, and her lump sum award, with the maximum RRSP contribution made, substantiates this view.\n[14] The addition of the interest income, pursuant to the Order of the Tribunal in 1998, into Ms. Green\u2019s 2000 income tax return changed the picture. The interest award was made without tax having been withheld. The Income Tax Act does not require such a withholding of tax for interest income, received for any reason. Therefore, in addition to any small amount of interest Ms. Green might have received from investments in 2000, she received an additional amount of interest very close to the amount she contributed to her RRSP. This interest income was taxable income for the year 2000, and, at a tax rate of close to 50%, virtually removed any anticipated fifty percent refund based on the RRSP contribution.\n[15] Ms. Green noted in her evidence before the Tribunal that her RRSP contributions, had they been made on an annual basis from 1989 to 2000 for the maximum allowable amount, would have grown exponentially. Historically, these years were financial growth years for equity investors, investing inside a Registered Retirement Savings Plan, where the money could grow without tax consequences until the time for its removal. Ms. Green missed this opportunity because she did not have available to her the monies which she should have had, had she not been a victim of discrimination.\n[16] None of these tax implications were addressed by the Respondents when the calculation of the gross up was made in 2000. Indeed, the calculation was made before the Respondents were aware of the details of Ms. Green\u2019s 2000 Income Tax Return. Roger Dart, the Acting Director of Financial Services, HRDC, Ontario Region, and the person to whom Ms. Green turned when she was attempting to understand the calculation of the gross up presented to her, indicated in his evidence before the Tribunal that the gross up represented merely the difference in tax payable as a result of Ms. Green\u2019s receipt of the lump sum employment income in one year, compared with the receipt of that income spread over an eleven-year period. Although he noted that the methodology of calculation of such a gross up had never before been questioned, and that no thought to the income tax implications of the award had been given, his evidence was that this was the appropriate methodology based on the best estimates his department could make.\n[17] Ms. Green\u2019s financial expert, Mr. Brian Saxe, a Chartered Accountant, agreed. His expert opinion was that the calculation of the gross up by the Respondents was correct in its addressing of the lump sum remedial award made to Ms. Green. His concern, as an accountant who was asked to address the income tax implications of both the lump sum award and the interest award, was that Ms. Green was not in the same position that she would have been had she received the interest award spread over the eleven years, as opposed to in one year. He opined that there should have been some methodology to address the adverse income tax implications to Ms. Green of this additional lump sum interest payment. However, he did not offer an alternate methodology for the calculation of the gross up.\nIV. Conclusion [18] The Tribunal is most concerned that the evidence of Mr. Roger Dart, when combined with that of Ms. Green, indicates that there was no thought given to the income tax implications of the awards made in the June, 1998 decision of the Tribunal.\n[19] Mr. Dart consistently answered Ms. Green\u2019s pointed questions in cross-examination that the gross up calculation was based on the reading of the decision with some interpretive help from the Department of Justice. As he noted, he could not recall discussing income tax implications. It was a matter of how to determine the gross up itself. [Mr.Dart\u2019sevidenceatp.33567] Ms. Green\u2019s evidence was that there was no communication between herself and HRDC concerning the gross up.\n[20] The original Order read as follows: ... that Nancy Green receive from her employer a gross up to compensate her for adverse income tax implications due to her non-receipt of annual income .... This gross up can be calculated by the compensation department of the Public Service Commission. The Tribunal will retain jurisdiction concerning this issue. If a figure mutually approved by Ms. Green and her department cannot be reached, the Tribunal will hear submissions upon this issue.\n[21] This Order contemplated communication between Ms. Green and her department. This was lacking, as evidenced by Ms. Green\u2019s view that it was necessary to re-convene the Tribunal in order to receive the information which Mr. Dart gave in his evidence concerning the calculation of the gross up.\n[22] As was evident at the original Tribunal hearing, so it appears to remain. After the hearing, there is a distinct lack of communication between the Respondents and their employee, leading to mistrust and misunderstanding. Certainly, there has remained a chasm between Ms. Green and the Respondents in the communication area. This has been, and appears to remain, the main cause of Ms. Green\u2019s anxiety and difficulties with understanding the rationale of her employer. The Tribunal, however, has no jurisdiction at this time to deal with this ongoing problem of communication. Some of the Orders made by the Tribunal in its 1998 decision attempted to address this issue.\n[23] From the evidence before the Tribunal concerning the gross up calculation, on a balance of probabilities, the calculation made by the Respondents was the correct one. Both the evidence of Mr. Roger Dart and Ms. Green\u2019s expert, Mr. Brian Saxe, underline the methodology as one which addresses the income tax implications of the lump sum award adequately and correctly.\n[24] The interest award was made to address the loss of opportunity to invest which was caused by the discriminatory practices which did not allow Ms. Green to continue her position as a PM-6, and to advance as she should have in the public service. Pursuant to the Income Tax Act, this is interest income and is taxed in the year received. Ms. Green had to address this income in her 2000 Income Tax Return. Her submission concerning the interest award is that it is an integral part of the remedial award for the discriminatory practices of the Respondents, and, as such, should have been considered when calculating the gross up.\n[25] How this was to be done was not addressed before the Tribunal. Although Ms. Green presented a number of scenarios, there are many others which come to mind in attempting to deal with such awards. Should Ms. Green have requested that the interest income award be spread over a number of years? Should she have requested that her Income Tax Returns for a number of years past be re-assessed, with a portion of the interest income added to each of those re-assessments?\n[26] This raises an interesting question: can the victim of discrimination ever be made completely whole? In his evidence, Mr. Dart said he had never been advised what the phrase making the person whole meant and indicated that he did not understand it. Surely, this concept arises from the purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act as elucidated in section 2. The Act has been promulgated to address discriminatory practices and to effect remedies which will redress those practices so that persons will have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have ....\n[27] In Ms. Green\u2019s case, as with most cases, this probably can never be completely and fully achieved. Financially, Ms. Green is likely never going to live through a stock market period similar to the 1990\u2019s. Her opportunity to invest at that unusual time is lost forever. There is no methodology to make her whole in that scenario.\n[28] Should the Respondents be responsible for the tax on the interest award, made to address Ms. Green\u2019s lost investment opportunity? Had Ms. Green made investments outside her RRSP during the 1989-2000 period, and received a rate of return equal to the Tribunal award (the Canada Savings Bond rate), she would have been responsible for the tax payable on that interest. Had she made investments inside her RRSP during the period, and received the Canada Savings Bond rate of return, she would have been responsible for the tax consequences of her growing fund when the monies were withdrawn sometime in the future. How can the calculation of the gross up take these speculative tax implications into consideration? On a balance of probabilities, it cannot. There was no evidence before this Tribunal which indicated that another gross up calculation would be more likely a better method to take all the income tax implications of such awards into consideration.\n[29] Therefore, although the Tribunal finds that the lack of communication and involvement by the Parties in the gross up calculation is unacceptable, the final calculation of the gross up made by the Respondents is probably as close as they could reasonably ascertain without moving into the realm of speculation and hypothetical reasoning.\n[30] Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the gross up as calculated by the Respondents addresses adequately that part of the June 26,1998 decision which ordered that Ms. Green receive a gross up to compensate her for the income tax implications of her receipt of the remedial awards made in that decision.\nSigned by\nElizabeth Leighton Chairperson\nSheila Devine Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario October 28, 2003\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T447\/0296\nStyle of Cause:\nNancy Green v.

INTRODUCTION\nII. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] On November 4, 2000, Marc Genest filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) against his employer, Bell Mobility Inc. (Bell Mobility).\n[2] In the reasons for his complaint, Marc Genest maintains that his employer discriminated against him in denying him the right to buy life insurance for his same-sex spouse in like manner as for a different-sex spouse. He thus claims that his employer differentiated adversely in relation to him in the course of his employment because of his sexual orientation and his marital status, in contravention of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[3] The complainant's common-law spouse died on February 16, 1998. The complainant received no life-insurance benefit following this death.\n[4] The respondent has submitted to the Tribunal a motion for dismissal of Marc Genest's complaint on the ground that it was filed late. In support of this claim, the respondent invokes the application of subsection 41(1) of the Act and its paragraph (e) which read as follows:\n41 (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that (e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.\n[5] The last of the events giving rise to the complaint occurred upon the death of the complainant's spouse, to wit, on February 16, 1998, and the complaint was filed on November 4, 2000.\n[6] The respondent considers that the complaint was filed more than one year after the last of the events on which it is based occurred.\n[7] It finds fault with the Commission for having decided to deal with the complaint even though the complainant has given no explanations or reasons to warrant his being given more than one year to file his complaint.\n[8] The respondent is therefore asking the Tribunal to dismiss Marc Genest's complaint because it was filed late. The respondent's motion raises the issue of whether the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has the power to examine and rule on decisions of the Commission.\nThe Vermette case1 provides an answer to this question.\nIt is clear that a Human Rights Tribunal does not have the power to quash a decision of the Commission that has been made under section 41(1)(e) of the Act....\n[9] Moreover, in Oster2 and Parisien,3 it has been firmly established that only the Federal Court has the power to oversee measures and decisions of the Commission.\nII.

Remedy\nIX. Order\n[1] For several years, Salvatore Milazzo drove a bus for Autocar Connaisseur Inc. In August of 1999, Mr. Milazzo was ordered by his employer to undergo a drug test. The results came back positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites. As a result, Mr. Milazzo\u2019s employment with the company was terminated, in accordance with Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s zero tolerance drug policy.\n[2] Mr. Milazzo alleges that in failing to accommodate his perceived drug dependence, and in terminating his employment, Autocar Connaisseur has contravened section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. It is further alleged that Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s policy requiring that bus drivers undergo drug tests violates section 10 of the Act.\nI. The Events Giving Rise to Mr. Milazzo\u2019s Complaint A. Mr. Milazzo\u2019s Employment with Autocar Connaisseur [3] Mr. Milazzo was hired by Autocar Connaisseur in July of 1994. Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s business is largely dependent on tourism and is seasonal in nature, with the summer months being the company\u2019s busy period. In order to respond to the fluctuating demand for its services, Autocar Connaisseur employs a small group of permanent bus drivers who work year-round, and hires a larger group of drivers to work on a seasonal basis.[1] Mr. Milazzo fell into this latter category - driving a bus for several months each year, and collecting Employment Insurance benefits in the off season.\n[4] It appears that Mr. Milazzo\u2019s employment history with Autocar Connaisseur was largely unremarkable, and there is no evidence before us of any significant problems with his performance on the job. It should be noted, however, that Mr. Milazzo did not work for Autocar Connaisseur in the summer of 1997, as his driver\u2019s licence had been suspended, as a result of his having been convicted of impaired driving. This conviction relates to an incident occurring outside working hours, and there is no evidence before the Tribunal that Mr. Milazzo ever drove a bus while impaired by either drugs or alcohol.\n[5] During the years that he worked for Autocar Connaisseur, Mr. Milazzo operated a 40 foot passenger bus or motor coach. Mr. Milazzo was initially assigned to shuttle passengers between the Casino de Montr\u00e9al and the casino parking lots, and to ferry passengers between city hotels and the airports. Autocar Connaisseur had ongoing contracts to provide these services, and the routes operated on a fixed schedule.\n[6] Autocar Connaisseur also provided charter services to groups traveling throughout North America. In the course of his employment with Autocar Connaisseur, Mr. Milazzo drove groups of passengers all over Quebec and Ontario.\n[7] By the summer of 1999, Autocar Connaisseur had lost the Casino contract. At this point, Mr. Milazzo was primarily driving airport runs. However, on June 4, 1999, Mr. Milazzo drove to upstate New York, meeting a bus returning from Virgina Beach, and driving it back to Montreal. According to Mr. Milazzo, he was not scheduled to drive to New York State, but was asked to go on short notice, because no other driver was available.\nB. Milazzo\u2019s Drug Test [8] Although Mr. Milazzo claimed at one point in his testimony that he did not know that Autocar Connaisseur had a drug testing policy, it is clear from his other comments that he was well aware of the policy. However, Mr. Milazzo understood that only drivers going into the United States would be tested. As he did not drive to the U.S. on a regular basis, Mr. Milazzo did not think that the policy applied to him.\n[9] According to Mr. Milazzo, in the summer of 1999, rumours began circulating within the company that all drivers were going to be tested, and not just the drivers going to the States. Sometime in mid-August, Mr. Milazzo came to work and was told by the dispatcher that he had missed his appointment for his drug test. When he advised the dispatcher that he did not know anything about a test, Mr. Milazzo says that he was told that a new date would be set for him to be tested. Mr. Milazzo says that the test was carried out less than a week later. It appears from the evidence of other witnesses that Mr. Milazzo\u2019s test took place on August 20, 1999.\n[10] Mr. Milazzo was required to attend at a small clinic in downtown Montreal. He was asked for proof of his identity, and then told to go into a washroom, and provide a urine sample. The entire process took 10 to15 minutes.\n[11] On August 24, Mr. Milazzo received a telephone call from a doctor associated with the clinic, who advised him that his urine had tested positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites. The doctor further advised Mr. Milazzo that the positive test results would be reported to Autocar Connaisseur.\nC. The Termination of Mr. Milazzo\u2019s Employment with Autocar Connaisseur [12] On August 25, 1999, Mr. Milazzo reported to work as usual. After completing one airport run, Mr. Milazzo was told to go to the office, where he met with one of the dispatchers - an individual identified only as Denis. According to Mr. Milazzo, Denis told him that the company had been notified of Mr. Milazzo\u2019s positive test results. Denis then advised Mr. Milazzo that he was suspended from work for two days, until Pierre Bougie could review the matter, and decide what to do with Mr. Milazzo.\n[13] It appears that Autocar Connaisseur had recently become unionized. Although Mr. Milazzo asserts that he was not a member of the union, he says that in the course of his discussion with Denis, Denis told Mr. Milazzo that he would try to get a union delegate to assist Mr. Milazzo, and that hopefully, Mr. Milazzo would be able to stay with the company.\n[14] Two days later, Mr. Milazzo met with Pierre Bougie. M. Bougie did not testify, and his role with the company was never explained. It appears that M. Bougie was a member of the senior management at Autocar Connaisseur. Mr. Milazzo says that he told M. Bougie that he really loved his job, and that he was ready to go to rehab for what happened. Mr. Milazzo testified that he also asked for a second test, to be sure that he had really tested positive.[2] M. Bougie evidently responded by saying that he was sorry, but there was nothing that he could do - he had to fire Mr. Milazzo.\n[15] During this meeting, M. Bougie had Mr. Milazzo sign a document which was written entirely in French. Mr. Milazzo testified that he has difficulty reading French, but that M. Bougie explained that a union representative should have been present at the meeting, and that, by signing the document, a union representative would be made available to assist him. In fact, the document is a waiver of Mr. Milazzo\u2019s right to have a union representative present at the meeting. Mr. Milazzo was quite confused in his testimony on a number of points, including the status of the union at Autocar Connaisseur. We are not persuaded that M. Bougie intentionally misled Mr. Milazzo in order to have him sign the document. In all of the circumstances, we are of the view that it is more probable that Mr. Milazzo simply did not understand the explanation offered by M. Bougie regarding the issue of union representation.\n[16] There are a number of inconsistencies in Mr. Milazzo\u2019s evidence regarding his dealings with M. Bougie. Although Mr. Milazzo initially testified that M. Bougie was clear during the meeting that he had no choice but to fire Mr. Milazzo, Mr. Milazzo also says that M. Bougie said due to the circumstances I cannot put you back to work right now. Give me a couple of days and I will see what I can do. Mr. Milazzo then says that after his meeting with M. Bougie, he waited to hear from a union representative. He states that he made no effort to contact a union representative, as he was not allowed to be anywhere near the offices of Autocar Connaisseur.\n[17] A couple of days later, Mr. Milazzo received his Record of Employment from Autocar Connaisseur, indicating that he had been dismissed. Despite his testimony that he was not allowed near Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s premises, Mr. Milazzo says that he then went back to see M. Bougie, asking that he be laid off. Mr. Milazzo says that he did this so that he would be able to collect Employment Insurance benefits. This testimony must be considered in light of Mr. Milazzo\u2019s subsequent assertion that it was several months before he became aware that the termination of his employment by Autocar Connaisseur for cause would disentitle him to EI benefits.\n[18] According to Mr. Milazzo, M. Bougie refused to lay him off.\n[19] It is common ground that Mr. Milazzo\u2019s employment was terminated as a result of his positive drug test, and ultimately, nothing turns on these inconsistencies in Mr. Milazzo\u2019s testimony. Nevertheless, these and other inconsistencies in Mr. Milazzo\u2019s testimony cause us to approach his evidence regarding more central issues with some caution.\nII. The Motor Coach Industry [20] Evidence with respect to the state of the motor coach industry was provided by James Devlin, and Brian Crowe. Mr. Devlin is the current President of Autocar Connaisseur. Mr. Crowe is the President of Motor Coach Canada, the trade association representing motor coach companies and motor coach tour operators in Canada. Motor Coach Canada represents approximately 95 bus operators and 115 tour operators - somewhere between 75% and 90% of the Canadian industry.\n[21] Motor coach companies generally have approximately 75% of their employees working as drivers. Fifteen or 20% of the employees are mechanics, and the remainder provide administrative services. Most Canadian companies are fairly small, family-run businesses.\n[22] The motor coach industry operates on an on demand basis. According to Mr. Crowe, a typical operator in the bus industry operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. As Mr. Crowe noted, the industry has to have services available when people want to move. This means that route patterns may be quite unpredictable: Mr. Crowe cites the example of travel to the United States, stating that a company may not go to the United States at all one month, and then make 20 U.S. trips the next month, because of customer demand.\n[23] According to Mr. Crowe, it is this ability to respond quickly to customer demand that is one of the strengths of the motor coach industry.\nA. The Economic Condition of the Motor Coach Industry [24] Mr. Crowe described the Canadian motor coach business as a mature industry, meaning that there is little growth in this sector. Indeed, the industry is in decline. Mr. Crowe explained that charter bus companies in Canada have to compete against heavily subsidized transport providers such as the airlines and Via Rail. World events, such as the Gulf War, the September 11,2001 attacks, the war in Iraq, the SARs epidemic and the outbreak of Mad Cow disease in western Canada have combined to greatly reduce the tourism business available to the motor coach industry.\n[25] The state of the market creates serious economic challenges for motor coach operators. Mr. Crowe explained that a motor coach costs $600,000.00. Charter rates in Canada now vary between $500 and $700 per day, meaning that bus companies operate on very thin margins. This has resulted in a number of company bankruptcies in the industry in recent years.\nB. The Regulatory Environment [26] The motor coach industry in Canada is heavily regulated. Because Autocar Connaisseur operates out of the Province of Quebec, it is the regulatory environment in that Province that is germane to our inquiry.\n[27] An Act respecting owners and operators of heavy vehicles[3] (Bill 430) came into force in Quebec in 1998, as a result of the tragedy at Les \u00c9boulements - a bus accident that took some 40 lives. The Bill was designed to increase road safety, and introduced an administrative registration system for owners and operators of heavy equipment, including buses. Amongst other things, this regulatory scheme calls for on-going conduct reviews. The Quebec Transport Commission is authorized to impose administrative measures on operators who have been assigned conditional or unsatisfactory safety ratings. In particular, the Commission has the power to cancel the operating licences of companies who are found to have operated in an unsafe manner, effectively putting them out of business. As will be described further on in this decision, in 1999, Autocar Connaisseur was itself the subject of safety-related proceedings before the Transport Commission, and was at risk of losing its operating licence.\n[28] Amongst other safety measures implemented as a result of Bill 430, motor coach company registration forms require bus companies to advise whether the company has a plan in place to control the consumption of alcohol and drugs by bus drivers.\n[29] There are numerous other statutory obligations imposed on bus operators, including obligations under the Canada Labour Code[4], the federal Motor Vehicle Transport Act[5], 1987, and the Queb\u00e9c Civil Code.\n[30] Cross-border travel presents a particular challenge for bus operators, as operators providing services to the United States are also subject to American laws, including laws relating to drug testing.\nC. Cross-Border Travel and American Regulatory Requirements [31] Evidence with respect to the American environment was introduced through Ms. Barbara Butler, as well as through Mr. Crowe and Mr. Devlin. Ms. Butler was qualified as an expert in policy development and implementation for issues relating to alcohol and drugs in the workplace.\n[32] American law requires that bus drivers operating vehicles in the United States be subjected to pre-employment, random, post-accident and for-cause[6] drug testing. The testing process is subject to strict regulation, and there are stringent protocols in place regarding the collection and analysis of samples.\n[33] Several witnesses testified that the use of drug testing in the transportation industry was introduced as a part of the American War on Drugs. Whatever the reasons for the enactment of the legislation, as of July 1, 1996, commercial motor vehicle operators driving in the United States are subject to Federal Department of Transportation Alcohol and Drug Testing Regulations. This legislation also applies to Canadian companies driving in the United States, as well as to any Canadian driver who has the reasonable potential for crossing the border. According to Ms. Butler, this means any driver ... who can, will or does cross the border.\n[34] Ms. Butler testified that infractions of the law are treated very seriously by the American authorities: companies are liable to fines of up to $10,000 (US), per driver, per trip, if drivers enter American territory without having been tested for alcohol or drugs. American government auditors regularly visit bus companies in Canada, in order to ensure that any cross-border travel is carried out in accordance with the American regulatory regime. Flagrant violations of U.S. law can result in the cancellation of the certification that bus companies require to drive in the States.\nD. Drug Testing in the Canadian Motor Coach Industry [35] According to Mr. Crowe, about 90% of Canadian motor coach operators are licenced to drive in the U.S. As a result, the issue of drug testing is of considerable importance to the motor coach industry.\n[36] Ms. Butler, Mr. Crowe and Mr. Devlin all expressed frustration with the Canadian government\u2019s actions regarding the application of U.S. law to Canadian bus companies. The American government initially looked at implementing alcohol and drug testing in the transportation industry in the 1980's. At that time, the Canadian federal Department of Transport expressed some interest in working with the motor coach industry, in order to develop a legislative framework to integrate US legal requirements into the Canadian milieu. Ultimately, however, the Department opted not to involve itself in the issue, leaving Canadian bus companies to their own devices in trying to figure out how best to deal with American legal requirements, while still complying with Canadian human rights law.\n[37] Ms. Butler testified that most Canadian bus companies use alcohol and drug testing. Some companies segregate their drivers into two pools - one composed of drivers who travel on U.S. routes, or have the potential to drive to the U.S., and a second pool composed of drivers who only drive on Canadian routes. In such cases, only the former group will be tested. However, many companies have concluded that they want the same safety standards for all of their drivers, and subject all of their drivers to alcohol and drug testing as a result. In some companies, all drivers either go to the U.S. on a regular basis, or have the potential to drive there. In these companies, all drivers will therefore be subject to alcohol and drug testing.\nIII. Autocar Connaisseur A. The Situation at Autocar Connaisseur in 1997-1999 [38] At the time that Mr. Milazzo started working for Autocar Connaisseur, the company was owned by the Calci family. Lorenzo Calci ran the company on a day-to-day basis. In June of 1997, the company was acquired by Coach U.S.A. Inc. of Houston, Texas. Mr. Calci initially stayed on as President of Autocar Connaisseur until November 1997, when he was replaced by Mr. Devlin. Mr. Devlin was the President and former owner of several other bus companies that had been acquired by Coach U.S.A.\n[39] Mr. Devlin testified that when Coach U.S.A. took control of Autocar Connaisseur, it quickly discovered that the company was in serious trouble. According to Mr. Devlin, record - keeping at the company was nonexistent, inventories were greatly overstated, and buses that were recorded as being part of the fleet could not be found. At the same time, the company was facing an application for certification from a trade union.\n[40] As was previously noted, the bus industry in Quebec is under the supervision of the Quebec Transport Commission. In late 1997, Mr. Devlin became aware that the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019assurance-automobile du Queb\u00e9c (or SAAQ) had commenced proceedings before the Transport Commission against Autocar Connaisseur. SAAQ was evidently seeking to have Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s operating license cancelled because of the way that the company was conducting its business. Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s new owners discovered that the company had previously lost its right to certify the roadworthiness of its buses, because of earlier problems with the Transport Commission. According to Mr. Devlin, at this point, serious consideration was given to simply shutting the company down, although ultimately the decision was taken to work with the SAAQ, to try to turn the situation around.\n[41] Mr. Devlin testified that he attended a show-cause hearing before the Transport Commission in January of 1999. At the hearing, Mr. Devlin explained the different programs that he was going to implement at the company, dealing with bus safety and driver education. Mr. Devlin advised the Commission that it would take six to nine months before the company would be in total compliance with the applicable regulations. The hearing resulted in a warning to Autocar Connaisseur that any further infractions would result in the automatic cancellation of the company\u2019s operating licence. Such a step would mean the end of Autocar Connaisseur.\n[42] One of the measures taken by Autocar Connaisseur to satisfy the commitments made to the Transport Commission was a review of the implementation of the company\u2019s drug testing policy. It was this review that ultimately led to Mr. Milazzo being tested.\nB. Drug Testing at Autocar Connaisseur [43] According to Denis Filiatrault, a long time bus driver and tour guide at Autocar Connaisseur, the company had long had an unwritten zero tolerance policy regarding alcohol and drug s in the workplace. In late 1991 or 1992, Autocar Connaisseur introduced a written policy, which was the policy in effect at the time that Mr. Milazzo was tested. This policy was intended to apply to all of the company\u2019s drivers.\n[44] Mr. Filiatrault explained that the policy was well known to Autocar Connaisseur employees. Copies of the policy were included with employees\u2019 pay information on at least two occasions, although it appears that this may have only occurred at the time that the written policy was first introduced in the early 1990's, well before Mr. Milazzo joined Autocar Connaisseur. The orientation program for new employees included a segment dealing with alcohol and drug testing, and the company\u2019s zero tolerance approach to alcohol and drugs in the workplace was often discussed at employee training sessions. Mr. Filiatrault and Mr. Milazzo agree that a copy of the policy was posted on the bulletin board in the driver\u2019s lounge at Autocar Connaisseur.\n[45] Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s drug testing policy provides for both pre-employment and random testing. All Autocar Connaisseur drivers were subjected to pre-employment alcohol and drug testing. According to Mr. Devlin, if a prospective employee tested positive for either alcohol or drugs, Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s offer of employment would then be withdrawn.\n[46] Once a driver was employed by Autocar Connaisseur, he or she would be required to undergo random alcohol and drug testing. In order to carry out these random tests, all employees\u2019 names were entered into a computer, whereupon the computer would periodically generate random lists of employees identified for testing. Employees could also be tested after an accident, or where the company had concerns regarding possible alcohol or drug use by the employee. Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s testing policy stated that all positive test results would result in the immediate termination of the driver\u2019s employment.\n[47] Ms. Butler has worked with all of the major bus companies in Canada. She testified that Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s approach to alcohol and drug testing was similar to that taken by many small Canadian bus companies.\n[48] According to Mr. Devlin, the review of the administration of the company\u2019s alcohol and drug testing program after the Transport Commission hearings disclosed numerous problems with the way in which the policy was being implemented. In particular, Autocar Connaisseur management became aware that drivers were not being told of their appointments for random tests. An audit of the program was then conducted by Peter Booth. Mr. Booth reported to Mr. Devlin, and was identified as the Director of Safety.[7] From a review of Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s payroll records, Mr. Booth discovered that certain drivers, including Mr. Milazzo, had not been included in the testing pool.\n[49] Mr. Devlin testified that American Transportation regulations require that employees must first have a pre-employment test, before they can be included in the testing pool for random drug tests. For this reason, Autocar Connaisseur considers the drug test taken by Mr. Milazzo to be a pre-employment test, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Milazzo had been working for Autocar Connaisseur off and on for several years prior to the test.\nC. The Accommodation of Alcohol or Drug Dependent Employees by Autocar Connaisseur [50] Mr. Milazzo was summarily fired once his drug test came back positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites. It is common ground that no attempt was made to ascertain whether Mr. Milazzo suffered from a substance abuse disorder, or was merely a casual user of cannabis. Further, there is no suggestion that any attempt was made to accommodate Mr. Milazzo, once the results of his drug test were known.\n[51] According to Mr. Devlin, although it was not explicitly spelled out in Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s original written drug testing policy, the company is quite prepared to accommodate employees with problems, including substance abuse disorders, provided that the employee comes forward voluntarily, and admits to having a problem. Examples were cited of employees who had acknowledged suffering from gambling addictions or alcoholism. In each case, Mr. Devlin says the employees were offered the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, and resume active service with the company.\n[52] The company is not, however, prepared to allow an employee who tests positive in an alcohol or drug test the chance to undergo rehabilitation. According to Mr. Devlin, an employee who knowingly comes to work with alcohol or drugs in his system so fundamentally breaches the trust between employer and employee that there is no alternative but to terminate the employment relationship. Mr. Crowe testified that most Canadian bus operators respond to a positive drug test by terminating the employee.\n[53] If an employee tests positive in a random, post-hiring drug test, Autocar Connaisseur will provide the employee with the name of a substance abuse professional, but the employee is still fired. An individual who tests positive in a pre-employment test is not referred to a substance abuse professional. Rather, the individual is simply not hired by Autocar Connaisseur. Because Autocar Connaisseur viewed Mr. Milazzo\u2019s drug test as a pre-employment test, no effort was made to provide Mr. Milazzo with the name of a substance abuse professional once it was known that he had tested positive.\n[54] It is clear from Mr. Devlin\u2019s testimony that he was of the view that Mr. Milazzo had tried to beat the system, and had knowingly put the ongoing existence of the company at risk by driving to the United States without having first undergone a pre-employment drug test. Mr. Devlin explained that if Mr. Milazzo had been caught driving a bus in the United States without having first been tested, Autocar Connaisseur would have been exposed to significant fines and the potential loss of its American operating licence. In addition, the Autocar Connaisseur bus could have been impounded by the American authorities. Passengers would thus have been stranded in the States, until Autocar Connaisseur could send a second bus to bring them home. In addition to the negative customer relations impact that this would have had, Autocar Connaisseur would also have incurred the expense of the second bus, and would have been exposed to potential claims from unhappy passengers for the disruption to their vacations.\nD. Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s New Drug Testing Policy [55] Subsequent to the termination of Mr. Milazzo\u2019s employment with Autocar Connaisseur in 1999, Coach Canada has developed a new alcohol and drug testing policy, applicable to employees of Autocar Connaisseur. Ms. Butler, who worked with Coach Canada in the development of the new policy, explained that the policy remains one of zero tolerance, but now sets out clear rules, investigative tools and consequences for employees. The policy also focuses on prevention, through the use of supervisor training, and by encouraging employees to come forward voluntarily and to seek help where an employee thinks that he or she may suffer from a substance abuse problem.\n[56] One of the most significant changes in the new drug testing policy is that the policy now covers bus mechanics and not just bus drivers. According to Mr. Devlin, bus mechanics are required to certify the road-worthiness of company buses, and, like drivers, are in safety sensitive positions.\nIV. The Legal Framework [57] Mr. Milazzo\u2019s complaint is brought pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 7 makes it a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ, or to continue to employ, an individual, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 10 makes it a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or pursue a policy that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[58] Section 3 of the Act designates disability as a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 25 of the Act makes it clear that the term disability includes previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug.\n[59] Pursuant to section 15(1)(a) of the Act, it is not a discriminatory practice to treat an employee in a differential fashion, where the differential treatment is based upon a bona fide occupational requirement.\n[60] As a result of the Supreme Court of Canada decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU[8] ('Meiorin') and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights)[9] ('Grismer'), the historic distinction between direct and indirect discrimination has been replaced by a unified approach to the adjudication of human rights complaints. Under this approach, the initial onus is still on a complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made, and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent.[10]\n[61] Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the onus shifts to the respondent to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the discriminatory standard or policy is a bona fide occupational requirement. In order to establish this, the respondent must now prove that:\nit adopted the standard for a purpose that is rationally connected to the performance of the job; it adopted the standard in good faith, in the belief that it is necessary for the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate an individual employee sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship on the employer.[11]\n[62] Subsection 15 (2) of the Act stipulates that the factors that may be considered in assessing whether or not an undue hardship defense is made out are health, safety and cost, although the term 'undue hardship' itself is not defined in the Act. However, Meiorin and Grismer provide considerable guidance in determining whether or not an undue hardship defense has been made out. In Meiorin, the Supreme Court observed that the use of the word 'undue' implies that some hardship is acceptable - it is only 'undue' hardship that will satisfy the test.[12] The Supreme Court has further observed that in order to prove that a standard is reasonably necessary, a respondent always bears the burden of demonstrating that the standard incorporates every possible accommodation to the point of undue hardship.[13] It is incumbent on the respondent to show that it has considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation. The onus is on the respondent to prove that incorporating aspects of individual accommodation within the standard was impossible short of undue hardship.[14] The adoption of the respondent's standard has to be supported by convincing evidence. Impressionistic evidence will not generally suffice.[15] Finally, factors such as the financial cost of methods of accommodation should be applied with common sense and flexibility in the context of the factual situation under consideration.[16]\nV. What Is The Standard? [63] It is common ground that what is in issue in this case is Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s zero tolerance drug policy. The question then arises: Zero tolerance of what? Zero tolerance of employee impairment? Or zero tolerance of employees having drug metabolites in their systems?[17]\n[64] This question is best answered by considering the wording of the policy itself. Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s alcohol and drug policy discloses that the mischief that the policy is aimed at addressing is employee impairment. The policy states:\n[Translation]\nOur policy is simple, it is a tolerance zero policy. That is, we cannot at anytime, afford to have employees who are intoxicated while on duty.\n(Notre politique est simple, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un niveau de tol\u00e9rance z\u00e9ro. En effet, nous ne pouvons nous permettre d\u2019avoir des employ\u00e9s en \u00e9tat d\u2019intoxication \u00e0 quelque mo- ment que ce soit durant leur p\u00e9riode de travail.)\n[65] However, the standard that will attract adverse employment consequences is the presence of drug metabolites in an employee\u2019s urine:\n[Translation]\nAll bus drivers will be tested upon receiving an offer of employment. Thereafter, they will be tested randomly in accordance with American legislation. Any positive result will lead to an automatic termination of employment.\n(Tous nos employ\u00e9s chauffeurs seront test\u00e9s d\u00e8s qu\u2019une offre d\u2019emploi leur sera faite. Par la suite, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation am\u00e9ricaine, ils seront test\u00e9s au hasard. Tout r\u00e9sultat positif entra\u00eenera le cong\u00e9diement automatique.)\n[66] Having concluded that the standard in issue in this case is Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s prohibition on employees having drug metabolites in their system while at work, we will now consider the application of the standard, first in the context of Mr. Milazzo\u2019s section 7 complaint, and then in the context of the section 10 complaint.\nVI. The Section 7 Complaint A. Is There a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination? [67] In considering this complaint, we must first decide if Mr. Milazzo and the Commission have established a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability. Autocar Connaisseur contends that no prima facie case has been established here, as it has not been proven that Mr. Milazzo actually suffered from a disability. The respondent further submits that in light of the wording of Section 25 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the concept of perceived disability has no application in the case of drug dependence. In any event, the respondent says, Autocar Connaisseur did not perceive Mr. Milazzo to be disabled.\nB. Did Mr. Milazzo suffer from a disability? [68] The first question, then, is whether Mr. Milazzo suffered from a disability.[18] Although not necessarily dispositive of the issue, it should be noted that at the hearing Mr. Milazzo did not assert that he suffered from a drug-related disability at the time of his positive drug test.\n[69] In understanding issues related to substance abuse and dependency, the Tribunal was aided by the testimony of Dr. Ray Baker and Dr. Jean-Pierre Chiasson. Dr. Baker was called by the Commission, and was qualified as an expert in addiction medicine, and the pharmacology, physiology, detection and treatment of substance abuse disorders. Dr. Chiasson was called by Autocar Connaisseur, and was qualified as an expert in addiction medicine, in particular, the detection and treatment of substance abuse and dependence. Both doctors have considerable experience with workplace issues relating to drug use.\n[70] Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson were in substantial agreement that drug users fall into one of three categories: casual users, drug abusers and those who are drug dependent. Both doctors agree that casual users make a conscious choice to ingest drugs, and can basically take it or leave it at will. They also agree that individuals who have become addicted or dependent on drugs lose their ability to control their drug use, and suffer from a disease. Dr. Baker refers to the disease as neurobiological in nature, whereas Dr. Chiasson calls it a brain disease. Whatever the appropriate description, the experts agree that drug dependent individuals suffer from a disability.\n[71] The point at which the doctors diverge is in relation to the proper characterization of individuals in the intermediate stage of drug use - that is drug abuse. In Dr. Baker\u2019s view, drug abusers may suffer negative consequences as a result of their use of drugs, and may engage in hazardous behaviour, but these individuals have not lost control of their drug use. In other words, for the drug abuser, continued ingestion of drugs is still a chosen behaviour. According to Dr. Baker, drug abusers do not require treatment.\n[72] Dr. Chiasson agrees that for drug abusers, continued drug use is more a matter of personal choice than a reflection of a loss of control. However, Dr. Chiasson testified that drug abuse causes problems for the individual, and can lead to drug dependance. For this reason, drug abuse is listed in the Fourth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual published by the American Psychiatric Association. In Dr. Chiasson\u2019s opinion, both drug abuse and drug dependancy are brain diseases.\n[73] As will be seen from the discussion that follows, we do not find it necessary to resolve the disagreement between the experts on this point.\n[74] It will be recalled that Mr. Milazzo testified that when he was confronted with the positive result of his drug test, he told M. Bougie that he was ready to go to rehab for what happened. One conclusion that could be drawn from this statement is that, as of August of 1999, Mr. Milazzo may have perceived that he had a problem with his cannabis use, and was seeking help. Of course, another reasonable inference is that Mr. Milazzo was desperate, and was saying whatever he thought it would take to help him keep his job.\n[75] At the hearing, Mr. Milazzo testified that he used cannabis on a strictly recreational basis. In a letter sent to the Commission during the course of the investigation, Mr. Milazzo stated that he had consumed cannabis during his vacation, several weeks before his drug test, and that this had led to the positive result. However, other evidence before the Tribunal casts serious doubt on the reliability of Mr. Milazzo\u2019s explanation.\n[76] Dr. Baker testified that Mr. Milazzo\u2019s urine contained 64 nanograms of cannabis metabolite[19] per milliliter of urine. Both Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson discussed the half-life of cannabis, and the rate at which cannabis metabolites are excreted by the human body. Factors influencing the level of the metabolite in the system include the amount of cannabis ingested, the potency of the cannabis, and when the ingestion took place. The frequency of ingestion is also significant: Dr. Chiasson explained that a one-time user will excrete all of the metabolite within a couple of days of ingestion. However, because cannabis metabolites are fat soluble, and build up in body fat with regular use, long term users will continue to excrete cannabis metabolites in their urine for up to sixty days after the last ingestion of cannabis.\n[77] How then does Mr. Milazzo\u2019s testimony accord with the scientific data?\n[78] Dr. Baker did not have any information regarding Mr. Milazzo\u2019s claims as to the frequency of his drug use, and thus was not in a position to offer an opinion as to whether Mr. Milazzo\u2019s testimony accorded with scientific knowledge regarding the excretion of cannabis metabolite. Based upon Mr. Milazzo\u2019s test results alone, Dr. Baker could not offer an opinion as to whether Mr. Milazzo was a drug abuser, or suffered from drug dependance.\n[79] Dr. Chiasson agrees with Dr. Baker that one cannot deduce whether Mr. Milazzo was a casual user, an abuser, or drug dependent from the results of one drug test. However, Dr. Chiasson says that the test results call Mr. Milazzo\u2019s credibility into serious question. Dr. Chiasson was unequivocal that the level of cannabis metabolite found in Mr. Milazzo\u2019s urine on August 20, 1999, was inconsistent with Mr. Milazzo\u2019s being a recreational user who had consumed cannabis several weeks before the test. Citing existing research in the area, Dr. Chiasson stated that it is improbable that an individual who was a casual user would still test positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites even five days after his last use. If Mr. Milazzo truly had not consumed cannabis for some time before the test,[20] the continuing presence of cannabis metabolite in his urine suggests long-term use, rather than occasional consumption.\n[80] Mr. Milazzo insisted, under oath, that he was strictly a recreational cannabis user. While Dr. Chiasson\u2019s testimony leads us to suspect that Mr. Milazzo may well have had a more serious problem with his drug usage than he would have us believe, Mr. Milazzo has the burden of establishing that he suffered from a disability. In light of the inconsistencies in the evidence, we find that this burden has not been met.[21]\n[81] The fact that we are not persuaded that Mr. Milazzo suffers from a disability is not necessarily fatal to Mr. Milazzo\u2019s section 7 complaint. Mr. Milazzo asserts that Autocar Connaisseur perceived that he suffered from a drug-related disability, and thus the issue of perceived disability must be considered.\nC. Does the Concept of Perceived Disability Apply to Cases of Alcohol or Drug Dependence? [82] Autocar Connaisseur acknowledges that in Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montr\u00e9al (City); Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Boisbriand (City[22]), the Supreme Court of Canada held that the prohibition against discriminating on the basis of handicap or disability extends to prohibit discrimination based on perceived disabilities as well.\n[83] However, counsel for Autocar Connaisseur notes that the decision in Boisbriand was based on the Qu\u00e9bec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms[23]. The Supreme Court also considered section 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which includes disability as one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. Counsel submits that in this case, regard must be had to the express wording of section 25 of the Act. Parliament has provided a specific definition for disabilities arising out of drug dependency, stating that disability includes ... previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug. No mention is made of the concept of perceived disability in section 25. Thus, Autocar Connaisseur says, Mr. Milazzo must establish that he actually suffered from a previous or existing dependence on a drug. The concept of perceived disability has no application in this case.\n[84] In support of its argument, counsel cites the Tribunal decision in Vermette v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.[24] At issue in Vermette was whether the mere assertion that a complainant had previously been dependent on alcohol or a drug was sufficient to bring a case within the purview of section 25. The Tribunal concluded that it was not enough for a complainant to assert that she had a past dependency. There must be evidence before the Tribunal of a continuing disability, which disability is related to the past alcohol or drug dependence. With respect, we do not read Vermette, which predates the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Boisbriand, to address the question of the applicability of the notion of perceived disability to cases of alcohol or drug dependence.\n[85] It is true that Boisbriand makes reference only to section 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and does not expressly import the notion of perceived disability into section 25 of the Act. However, while section 25 does not expressly prohibit discrimination based on perceived dependance on alcohol or drugs, neither does section 3 of the Act. Nevertheless, using a purposive interpretation, the Supreme Court was able to interpret the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability to include the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of a perceived disability.\n[86] It is well established that human rights statutes are to be given a purposive interpretation - one that will best achieve their objectives.[25] In the case of the Canadian Human Rights Act, Parliament has identified the purpose of the Act in section 2, stating that:\nThe purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect ... to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on .... disability.\n[87] Thus, the purpose of the Act is to allow individuals the opportunity to realize their full potential, without being limited by arbitrary assumptions about their abilities, based upon their personal characteristics. A refusal by an employer to employ an individual, based upon the employer\u2019s perception that the individual is dependent on alcohol or drugs would, in our view, be contrary to the aims of the Act. Thus, the objectives of the Canadian Human Rights Act are best achieved by interpreting section 25 of the Act to include the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of a perceived disability.\n[88] Having concluded that section 25 of the Canadian Human Rights Act includes the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of a perceived disability, the final issue for the Tribunal is to determine whether Autocar Connaisseur perceived that Mr. Milazzo suffered from a drug related disability.\nD. Did Autocar Connaisseur perceive Mr. Milazzo to be drug dependent? [89] The evidence before us does not establish that Autocar Connaisseur perceived Mr. Milazzo to suffer from a drug related disability. The evidence of Mr. Devlin shows that the reason that Mr. Milazzo was tested in August of 1999 was because Autocar Connaisseur had just discovered that he had not been subjected to a pre-employment test, as was required by Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s drug testing policy. There is nothing before us that would suggest that anyone at Autocar Connaisseur had any suspicions that Mr. Milazzo might be using drugs, or any concerns with respect to his performance.\n[90] When Autocar Connaisseur became aware that Mr. Milazzo had tested positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites, Mr. Milazzo was summarily fired. There is no suggestion that any questions were asked, or any investigation carried out in order to determine whether Mr. Milazzo was drug dependent. Mr. Milazzo was fired because he failed his drug test. No one at Autocar Connaisseur knew, or cared, whether Mr. Milazzo was dependent on drugs. Indeed, there is nothing before us to suggest that anyone at Autocar Connaisseur ever turned their mind to the issue.\nE. Conclusion Regarding Mr. Milazzo\u2019s Section 7 Complaint [91] This is not an action for wrongful dismissal, and it is not for this Tribunal to determine whether testing positive for the presence of a cannabis metabolite constitutes just cause for Mr. Milazzo\u2019s dismissal by Autocar Connaisseur.\n[92] In order to benefit from the protections afforded by the Canadian Human Rights Act, a complainant must demonstrate the involvement of one or more of the proscribed grounds listed in section 3 of the Act. Having failed to establish that he was either disabled, or was perceived by Autocar Connaisseur to be disabled, Mr. Milazzo has not established a prima facie case of discrimination, and accordingly, his section 7 complaint must therefore be dismissed.\n[93] Having dismissed Mr. Milazzo\u2019s section 7 complaint, the section 10 complaint remains to be considered.\nVII. The Section 10 Complaint [94] In contrast to complaints under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which relate to employer actions affecting specific, named individuals, section 10 of the Act addresses the discriminatory effect that employer policies or practices may have on an individual or a class of individuals. The focus of our inquiry with respect to the section 10 complaint is thus not confined to the circumstances of Mr. Milazzo\u2019s own situation.\nA. Is There a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination? [95] We have no hesitation in finding that Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s drug testing policy prima facie discriminates against employees who are drug dependent. Mr. Devlin testified that in cases where a prospective employee tested positive for drugs in a pre-employment test, Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s offer of employment would be withdrawn. Similarly, an Autocar Connaisseur employee who tested positive would have his or her employment summarily terminated.\n[96] Some of these individuals will inevitably suffer from substance related disabilities. Indeed, Dr. Chiasson testified that a 1995 study disclosed that 50% of the employees who tested positive in a study of drug testing in industry suffered from either substance abuse or dependancy.\n[97] The fact that Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s drug testing policy has an adverse, differential effect on a protected class of individuals means that the policy is prima facie discriminatory.[26] Indeed, Mr. Devlin admitted as much in his testimony, and counsel for the respondent conceded that a prima facie case of discrimination exists in relation to the section 10 complaint.\nB. Has Autocar Connaisseur Discharged its Burden? [98] Having found that Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s drug testing policy is prima facie discriminatory, the onus shifts to the respondent to establish that not having drug metabolites in one\u2019s system is a bona fide occupational requirement for bus drivers. There are three elements that must be established in order to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide occupational requirement. Each of these elements will be considered in turn.\n(i) Rational Connection [99] In order to prove the existence of a bona fide occupational requirement, Autocar Connaisseur must first establish that requiring that its bus drivers not have drug metabolites in their systems is rationally connected to the function that drivers perform. The focus at this stage is not on the validity of the standard in issue, but rather on the validity of its more general purpose.[27]\n[100] We have previously identified the purpose of Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s drug testing policy as being the prevention of employee impairment. The Commission concedes, and we find that Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s goal of promoting road safety by preventing driver impairment is rationally connected to the business of providing bus transport.\n(ii) Good Faith [101] The second element that must be demonstrated by Autocar Connaisseur is that it adopted its zero tolerance standard in relation to the presence of drug metabolites in good faith, in the belief that it is necessary for the fulfilment of a legitimate work-related purpose. If the standard was not thought to be reasonably necessary or was motivated by discriminatory considerations, then it cannot be justified.\n[102] Once again, the Commission concedes that Autocar Connaisseur has acted in good faith in the promulgation of its drug testing policy. The Tribunal notes that, like other Canadian transport companies doing business in the United States, Autocar Connaisseur was placed in a very difficult position, as a result of the introduction of the American Department of Transport drug testing regulations. Transport companies were essentially left to fend for themselves, without any guidance or assistance from the Canadian government as to the appropriate method for satisfying American drug testing requirements within the Canadian legislative environment. It appears that Autocar Connaisseur did the best that it could, in difficult circumstances.\n[103] In all of the circumstances, the Tribunal is more than satisfied that the good faith element of the Meiorin test has been met.\n(iii) Reasonable Necessity [104] Finally, the onus is on Autocar Connaisseur to establish that its refusal to tolerate employees having drug metabolites in their system while at work is reasonably necessary to accomplish the company\u2019s goal of promoting road safety, by preventing driver impairment . To show that the zero tolerance standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible for Autocar Connaisseur to accommodate disabled employees who test positive for drugs, without imposing undue hardship on the company.\n[105] In examining whether Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s drug testing policy is reasonably necessary to promote road safety, consideration must first be given to the employment context in which Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s bus drivers operate.\n(a) The Employment Environment for Bus Drivers at Autocar Connaisseur [106] Mr. Devlin described the duties associated with driving a motor coach, explaining that alertness, as well as an ability to multi-task are essential. In addition to having to navigate a large vehicle through traffic, drivers have to be aware of the passengers at all times. By way of example, Mr. Devlin says a driver has to be aware if a passenger gets up to use the washroom, as a quick manoeuver by the driver could result in serious injury to the passenger.\n[107] Further, the environment in which motor coach drivers work makes it very difficult for bus companies to ensure that drivers are always up to the task.\n[108] Unlike the situation in previous drug testing cases, where employees worked under fairly close supervision inside bank offices (TD Bank), petroleum processing plants (Entrop) or the administrative offices of an Indian Band (Elizabeth M\u00e9tis Settlement), bus drivers at Autocar Connaisseur spend a considerable portion of their time on the road, away from the watchful eye of their superiors. Drivers doing casino and airport runs would be on the road much of each day, whereas drivers taking charter groups on tour could be away from the Autocar Connaisseur offices for as much as thirty days at a time. While drivers check in with Autocar Connaisseur dispatchers each day by telephone, the company is unable to verify that the driver had actually carried out the necessary pre-trip inspections, or to properly assess if the driver is indeed fit to drive.\n[109] Mr. Filiatrault testified that during the years that he has been with Autocar Connaisseur, problems have been encountered from time to time with bus drivers over-indulging in alcohol or other substances. These cases usually manifested themselves by drivers acting up in hotel bars during overnight stays during bus tours. Such incidents often came to the company\u2019s attention when passengers present in the bar complained to the tour guide, if one was accompanying the driver, who would, in turn, report the driver\u2019s behaviour to Autocar Connaisseur.\n[110] This inability on the part of Autocar Connaisseur management to closely supervise its workforce presents particular challenges for the company in monitoring employee performance. These difficulties are compounded by the somewhat transient nature of much of Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s workforce, with many drivers working for the company on a seasonal basis.\n[111] Mr. Crowe described the precarious economic position of the Canadian motor coach industry, indicating that the situation at Autocar Connaisseur was no different than that at other Canadian motor coach companies. As Mr. Devlin explained, Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s ability to monitor its workforce was also limited by the financial constraints under which the company operated. Mr. Devlin testified that in 1999, Autocar Connaisseur had a fleet of 125 buses. Although the company generated gross revenues of $10 million in 1998, in fact, Autocar Connaisseur was losing substantial sums of money. Mr. Devlin quickly realized that the charter market in Quebec was simply not there to support a fleet of that size. The decision was thus made to reduce the size of Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s fleet, and the company currently operates 29 vehicles.\n[112] Subsequent events such as the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001 further depressed the tourist industry. In 2002, the company realized a profit of $400,000 on sales of $5 million, but continues to carry an accumulated deficit of $10 million.\n(b) Route Assignments and Autocar Connaisseur Drivers [113] Mr. Filiatrault described the way in which routes are assigned to bus drivers. Autocar Connaisseur uses a seniority system for route assignment. Periodically, drivers are given the opportunity to bid on routes, with the most senior drivers choosing first. Mr. Filiatrault explained that the type of work that would be viewed as the most attractive would vary, depending on the types of clients and the distances involved.\n[114] According to Mr. Filiatrault, Mr. Calci would assist drivers with criminal records, who may have had problems entering the United States, by allowing them to drive on Canadian routes. It was not made clear how this would work, having regard to the seniority system.[28]\n[115] According to both Mr. Filiatrault and Mr. Devlin, there was no guarantee that drivers assigned to Canadian routes would not have to enter the United States on short notice. For example, the company could be called upon to provide a bus and driver in response to last minute charter requests. A bus could break down in the United States, making it necessary to send another driver and bus down to the States, to collect the passengers, and bring them back to Montreal. Even drivers assigned to airport runs could be called upon to drive to the United States on short notice, where, for example, a plane that was scheduled to land at Dorval airport was re- routed to Burlington, Vermont, because of weather conditions.\n[116] Indeed, Mr. Milazzo himself acknowledged that Autocar Connaisseur drivers could be called upon to drive anywhere.\n[117] During the time that Mr. Milazzo worked for Autocar Connaisseur, the company\u2019s seasonal drivers would be laid off at the end of the tourist season, when the charter business dried up. Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s permanent driving staff would then take over the contract work, such as casino and airport shuttle service. By the end of 1999, however, Autocar Connaisseur had lost both of these contracts. We were not told how many drivers Autocar Connaisseur now has on staff in the winter months.\n[118] With this understanding of the operating environment at Autocar Connaisseur, we will next examine the expert evidence regarding the use of drug testing in the workplace.\n(c) The Effects of Cannabis on the Brain [119] Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson each gave testimony with respect to the effects of cannabis consumption on the human brain, and once again were in substantial agreement on many points. The active ingredient in cannabis is Nine Delta tetrahydrocannabinol or 9 THC. The level of 9 THC in the cannabis available in Canada today is significantly higher than in the past, and the drug accordingly that much more potent.\n[120] Nine Delta tetrahydrocannabinol is released when cannabis is first ingested. The 9 THC takes effect immediately, with the acute phase of intoxication peaking ten to thirty minutes later. Cannabis users generally remain acutely intoxicated for a couple of hours, followed by a period of sub-acute intoxication. This sub-acute intoxication lasts for an additional 12-24 hours.\n[121] During the period of acute intoxication, the cannabis user experiences a sense of euphoria or high. During this phase, cannabis affects the user\u2019s memory, cognition, perception and motor activity. This is followed by a period of coming down, that can last an hour or so. During this period, the user\u2019s concentration, memory and reflexes may be affected. The intoxicating effect of cannabis may be enhanced or multiplied, if cannabis is ingested along with another intoxicant such as alcohol.\n[122] According to Dr. Chiasson, for chronic cannabis users, the sub-acute or hangover phase of cannabis intoxication is characterized by ongoing neuropsychological dysfunction that can impair the user\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle. Chronic users of cannabis can require up to 28 days of abstention or washout before their neuropsychological tests results return to normal. Dr. Baker testified that studies have shown impairment of fine motor skills for up to 24 hours, post-consumption, although he indicated that there is some question as to the validity of these studies.\n[123] In some cases, the consumption of cannabis can have longer-term effects on the user\u2019s ability to function. Chronic cannabis users can go through a period of withdrawal if they stop using the drug. Symptoms of withdrawal include irritability, restlessness, vivid disturbing dreams and poor concentration. These symptoms can persist for one to three weeks. During the withdrawal period, the user\u2019s perception, cognitive functioning and motor skills could be sufficiently impaired that the individual should not operate a motor vehicle.\n[124] Flashbacks are a second potential long-term effect of chronic cannabis use. Dr. Chiasson testified that in some cases, chronic cannabis users can experience the symptoms of acute cannabis intoxication quite suddenly, without having actually ingested the drug. These recurrences or flashbacks typically occur when the user is tired or under stress.\n[125] Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson agree that individuals employed in safety sensitive positions - that is, positions where an employee could put his own safety or the safety of others at risk - should not be performing tasks such as driving motor vehicles while their ability to drive is impaired by the use of cannabis.\n(d) The Extent of the Problem in the Transportation Industry [126] Alcohol and drugs are widely used in the general population in Canada. Ms. Butler referred to 2001 data compiled by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, which indicates that 83.6% of men and 75.7% of women are current drinkers. Eighteen percent of adult males reported having driven within an hour of drinking two or more drinks. Current marijuana users constitute 15.4% of the adult male population, and 7.3% of the female population. Some 4.9% of current cannabis users met the criteria of dependency. The CAMH study also reports a steady increase in the use of cannabis.\n[127] Dr. Baker\u2019s evidence in relation to cannabis was that 34% of Canadians have tried the drug. According to Dr. Chiasson, in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec, nearly 40% of the population reports having tried cannabis. Ten to fifteen percent of cannabis users have problems of abuse or dependency, according to Dr. Chiasson.\n[128] Insofar as the transportation industry is concerned, Ms. Butler testified that the Canadian government\u2019s lack of involvement in regulating alcohol and drug testing means that there is a limited amount of Canadian research available in this area. She did refer to a study conducted by the British Columbia Trucking Association in 1989. According to Ms. Butler, three-quarters of the drivers surveyed reported that alcohol had compromised safety, with one in nine drivers admitting that his or her own alcohol use had compromised safety at work. Seven out of ten drivers reported having worked while affected by alcohol, and half of the drivers reported knowing other drivers who drank at work. With respect to drugs, three-quarters of the drivers surveyed reported that drug use had compromised safety, with one in twelve drivers admitting that his or her own drug use had compromised safety at work.\n[129] This evidence certainly suggests that the use of drugs by drivers in the transportation industry is a real problem, with significant implications for public safety.\n[130] Evidence with respect to the level of alcohol and drug use in the transport industry in Quebec was provided by Maxime Brault, an epidemiological statistician with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019assurance-automobile du Quebec. M. Brault is currently involved in a study investigating road safety in the Province. In this context, M. Brault is investigating the use of alcohol and drugs by truck drivers in Quebec. In the course of M. Brault\u2019s research, he familiarized himself with other research carried out by the SAAQ.[29]\n[131] A study conducted by the SAAQ in 2001 used the roadside interception of trucks on Quebec highways in order to measure the incidence of alcohol and drug use amongst truck drivers. The study disclosed that 9% of drivers tested positive for one or more drugs in their system, with 4.8% testing positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites. It should be noted that 17% of the intercepted drivers declined to participate in the study.\n[132] Insofar as the experience at Autocar Connaisseur is concerned, we were told that there have only been a couple of drivers in recent years who have had problems with alcohol. It appears that Mr. Milazzo is the only Autocar Connaisseur driver who has had a positive drug test. However, this evidence cannot necessarily be interpreted to mean that there is little problem with alcohol or drug use amongst Autocar Connaisseur drivers, and that therefore a drug testing policy is unnecessary. As will be explored more fully further on in this decision, there is at least some evidence that would suggest that the presence of an alcohol and drug testing policy may have a deterrent effect.\n(e) What Drug Tests Look For [133] Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson gave extensive testimony with respect to drug testing, and once again, were in substantial agreement on many points. Workplace drug testing programs typically test for what is known as the NIDA 5[30] group of drugs. These drugs are marijuana or cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclodine and opiates.\n[134] In the case of cannabis, what is measured in the urine is 11-nor- -9-THC-9-COOH[31], a non-psychoactive by-product or metabolite produced when 9?THC is broken down in the body. In order to avoid false-positive tests in situations where, for example, an individual may have been passively exposed to cannabis in a smoky room, a cut-off level of 50 nanograms per millilitre is used. Urine samples containing less than 50 nanograms per millilitre of THC-acid will be recorded as negative.\n[135] A positive urine test will not indicate when the cannabis was used, or how much was ingested. All that a urine test shows is that an individual has used cannabis at some time in the past.\n[136] Unlike alcohol testing, where there is a direct correlation between the blood alcohol reading and the probable degree of impairment, the fact that an individual may test positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites in his urine does not mean that the individual was necessarily impaired at the time of the test. It takes thirty minutes after ingestion before cannabis metabolite will be detectable in urine, while the effect of the cannabis may peak as quickly as 10 minutes after consumption. As a result, an individual could be acutely intoxicated, and still test negative for cannabis metabolites. By the same token, cannabis metabolites could still be present in the system long after the individual ceases to be impaired.\n(f) The Efficacy of Drug Testing as a Means of Promoting Road Safety [137] The principle point of divergence between Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson relates to the efficacy of drug testing as a means of promoting road safety. The doctors agree that there is no single perfect means of detecting substance use in employees in safety sensitive positions, and that some cases will be missed, whatever approach is followed. While Dr. Chiasson believes that drug testing is a useful tool in managing employee impairment, Dr. Baker is of the view that there are other, more effective methods of achieving this goal.\n1. Dr. Baker\u2019s Position\n[138] According to Dr. Baker, there are many conditions that can compromise the ability of an employee in a safety sensitive position to perform his job in an appropriate manner. Alcohol or drug intoxication is one, but conditions such as fatigue, diabetes, depression and stress can all have a negative impact on employee performance. After alcohol, over-the-counter medications are the commonest source of employee impairment.[32] Dr. Baker questions the utility of testing for impairment caused by alcohol or any of the NIDA 5 drugs, when no tests are carried out with respect to these other common causes of impairment.\n[139] In Dr. Baker\u2019s view, drug testing is a very blunt instrument. He feels that there are boundary issues involved, and that it is not an employer\u2019s place to attempt to make medical diagnoses. Dr. Baker also questions the accuracy of drug test results, stating that employees exposed to regular testing quickly become adept at finding ways to beat the system through the use of adulterants and clean urine from other sources, or by drinking large quantities of water to dilute their own urine, thus reducing the concentration of drug metabolites below the permissible levels.\n[140] The preferable course is for employers to have clearly articulated policies, which are consistently applied. The workforce should be educated about substance abuse and the problems that it can cause. One goal of this training is to encourage employees to come forward if they observe a co-worker in trouble, rather than covering for the colleague, as is often the case. Supervisors should also be educated as to the warning signs of substance abuse disorders. Indicators that can often signal the presence of a substance abuse problem include things such as erratic employee attendance at work, behavioral issues and performance problems.\n[141] Once an employee is identified with a suspected substance abuse problem, the employee should be confronted about the employer\u2019s concern. Assistance should be offered to the employee in dealing with the problem. The employer may demand that the employee remain off the job until the employee has been evaluated by a physician, and has been determined to be fit to return to work.\n[142] Cases where an employee breaches a zero tolerance policy through the voluntary ingestion of either alcohol or drugs, because of a personal choice as opposed to a dependency problem, should be dealt with through the regular employer disciplinary process, with sanctions up to and including termination.\n[143] In situations where employees are going to be put into safety sensitive positions, Dr. Baker says that employers have a responsibility to have the individuals medically assessed in order to ensure that they are able to safely carry out their job. This evaluation should include a thorough biological, psychological, social and addiction evaluation, looking for any conditions that could interfere with the person's ability to perform his job safely, including invisible disabilities such as diabetes, coronary artery disease and substance dependence. Drug testing may play a useful part in such an assessment.\n[144] According to Dr. Baker, the cost of such a pre-employment evaluation is in the vicinity of $500 to $800 per employee.\n[145] Dr. Baker testified that this approach can be a more effective method of detecting substance abuse problems in the workplace than drug testing. In support of this contention, he cited the example of a West Coast marine organization, where several prospective employees with substance abuse problems tested negative in drug tests, but were subsequently identified through the use of a pre-employment medical assessment.\n[146] In Dr. Baker\u2019s view, drug testing also serves a useful role, as part of a monitoring program used to follow the recovery of individuals with substance abuse problems, after their return to work in safety sensitive positions. The Commission\u2019s own policy relating to workplace drug testing recognizes the usefulness of drug testing where an employer has reasonable cause to believe that an employee may be impaired by alcohol or drugs, or where an incident such as an accident raises questions as to the employee\u2019s fitness.[33]\n2. Dr. Chiasson\u2019s Position\n[147] Dr. Chiasson acknowledges that there are many other things that can impair employee performance, apart from the 5 drugs tested for in the NIDA 5 group. Drug testing is, however, one quick, reliable, cheap and easily administered tool that can effectively assist employers in identifying potential problems in employees in safety sensitive positions.\n[148] Dr. Chiasson agrees with Dr. Baker that drug testing is not perfect, but then, Dr. Chiasson says, neither is the type of assessment process advocated by Dr. Baker. Dr. Chiasson explained the difficulty in identifying some substance dependent individuals, noting that he has employed four secretaries with drug problems. Despite his training in the field, in each case, he was unaware of the individual\u2019s situation.\n[149] Dr. Chiasson testified that he has assessed patients whose substance abuse problems were not obvious to him. In these cases, the diagnosis was ultimately made with the assistance of drug testing. For Dr. Chiasson, drug testing provides useful, objective information.\n[150] While acknowledging that there are methods that can be used to defeat drug tests, Dr. Chiasson says that testing laboratories are adept at detecting attempts to thwart the process. For example, the specific gravity of urine is analyzed, in order to see if the urine has been diluted. The temperature of the urine is measured, in an effort to identify situations where clean urine is being substituted for that of the test subject. Tests are also carried out for the presence of adulterants.\n[151] Drug tests do not operate in a vacuum, according to Dr. Chiasson. When an individual tests positive in a screening test, it is then necessary to subject the individual to an evaluation, in order to determine whether the person suffers from a dependency problem. He testified that the cost of a follow-up evaluation, once an individual tests positive, is between $2000 and $4000.\n[152] What a drug test does do is provide a snapshot, at a specific time, which will document whether a person has been in contact with an illegal, and potentially addictive psychoactive substance that has the potential to endanger safety. According to Dr. Chiasson, this signals to the employer that the test subject is at an increased risk of posing a danger to safety in the workplace.\n(g) Positive Drug Tests as an Indicator of Increased Risk [153] This takes us to the heart of the disagreement between Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson. Both doctors agree that the fact that an individual tests positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites in their urine does not mean that the individual was necessarily impaired at the time of the test. Where the experts appear to disagree is on the question of whether an employer should be able to use drug testing in order to evaluate workplace risk.\n[154] Dr. Baker testified that information from urine tests as to whether a test subject had been exposed to cannabis at some point would be useful information for a health professional in assessing the risk posed by that employee. Indeed, he seems to agree that there is a correlation between a positive drug test and an increase in risk, although he was not aware of any studies that have demonstrated a correlation between the two. In Dr. Baker\u2019s view, it seems intuitive that this would be the case.\n[155] Dr. Baker\u2019s real problem with employer drug testing relates to a philosophical concern with boundaries and the appropriate role of health care providers and employers, respectively. In Dr. Baker\u2019s view, while an employer is absolutely entitled to evaluate workplace risk, he says that there are other ways that an employer can identify employees at risk of substance abuse problems, through the methods previously discussed, such as attendance monitoring. If an employer is going to test for health-related risk, then there are other health conditions that the employer should test for, in order to ensure that the workforce is not impaired. In Dr. Baker\u2019s opinion, employers do not test for conditions such as diabetes or coronary artery disease, because they recognize that it is not their role to do so. By the same token, Dr. Baker says, it is not for employers to subject their employees to urine testing.\n[156] Although Dr. Baker was not aware of any studies in the area, it appears that some research has indeed been done on the relationship between positive urine test results and motor vehicle accidents. In Canada, the most relevant study is that currently being carried out by the SAAQ. M. Brault testified that the purpose of the study was to examine the role that alcohol and drugs played in fatal motor vehicle accidents on Quebec\u2019s highways.\n[157] There are several aspects to this study. First, voluntary random roadside screening was carried out with respect to Quebec drivers, in order to determine the prevalence of alcohol and drug use by recreational drivers. A similar study was carried out for commercial drivers of vehicles weighing over 3000 kilograms, such as trucks and buses, to see if this group consumes the same substances, in the same proportions. In each case, the drivers were subjected to an interview, as well as to Breathalyzer, saliva and urine testing. Adjustments were made to the results to take into account the significant number of drivers who refused to participate in the study.\n[158] These results were then compared to the incidence of positive alcohol and drugs tests in another group of drivers. This group is comprised of drivers who had been killed in Quebec road accidents, in circumstances where the drivers had been deemed to be at fault in causing the accident. The results of this comparative analysis would then help determine whether the presence of certain substances in a driver\u2019s system indicates that the driver presents a higher risk of being involved in an accident.\n[159] The analysis of the data relating to the random roadside screening of Quebec drivers has now been completed. For recreational drivers, cannabis was the drug most frequently found, with 6.7% of this group testing positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites.[34]\n[160] The aspect of the study dealing with the prevalence of alcohol or drug use amongst drivers causing fatal motor vehicle accidents is not yet final, because the researchers have not yet obtained a sufficiently large sample of data from deceased drivers in order to be completely satisfied beyond all doubt as to the reliability of the information. Preliminary results have, however, already been obtained and published. These results indicate that 69 out of 364 or 19.5% of deceased drivers responsible for fatal motor vehicle accidents tested positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites. By comparing this figure to the 6.7% incidence in the general driving population, the authors of the study have concluded that the presence of cannabis metabolites in a driver\u2019s urine is associated with a 2.2 times greater risk of being involved in a fatal motor vehicle accident.\n[161] The actual risk of accident associated with cannabis impairment may in fact be more than 2.2 times greater, as people may continue to test positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites after they ceased to be impaired.\n[162] Given Dr. Baker\u2019s acknowledgement that a positive drug test is useful in assessing the risk posed by a particular driver, coupled with the testimony of Dr. Chiasson and the findings, albeit preliminary in nature, of the SAAQ study, we are satisfied that urine testing for the presence of cannabis metabolites does assist in identifying drivers who are at an elevated risk of accident.\n(h) Do Drug Tests Serve to Deter Employee Impairment? [163] A further argument advanced in defense of the practice of drug testing bus drivers is the deterrent effect that the presence of a drug testing policy allegedly has. In support of this contention, Autocar Connaisseur points to the fact that between January 1, 2000 to March 20th, 2003, the company has carried out 166 random drug tests. During that thirty-nine month period, not one Autocar Connaisseur bus driver tested positive for alcohol or drugs. While impressive, the utility of this evidence is diminished by the fact that we do not have similar data for the period before the drug testing policy was introduced. In other words, there is no way of knowing how many Autocar Connaisseur drivers would have tested positive for either alcohol or drugs if Autocar Connaisseur had not had a clearly articulated alcohol and drug testing policy.\n[164] Ms. Butler testified that deterrence is an important part of any drug testing policy. While few studies have been undertaken on the deterrent effect of workplace drug testing policies, Ms. Butler notes that in Australia, where random roadside alcohol screening is used, the incidence of alcohol related accidents has been significantly reduced. Studies have found that the possibility that motorists could, at any time, be subject to screening, will inevitably cause the potential drinking driver to think twice before getting behind the wheel.\n[165] Dr. Baker acknowledges that the presence of a drug testing policy could discourage drug dependent candidates from applying to a workplace that had this type of policy in place. The presence of such a policy would also tell employees not to consume drugs prior to regularly scheduled tests. Dr. Baker did not indicate whether non-dependent employees would also choose to permanently abstain, if the employee was exposed to the ongoing possibility of random testing.\n[166] Dr. Baker does point to the American experience, where there has been a significant reduction in the number of positive employee drug tests, but no corresponding diminution in the prevalence of substance abuse disorders in the workplace. Dr. Baker suggests that this means that employees are simply devising ways to beat the system. It seems to us, however, that another possible explanation for this phenomenon is that those with control over their alcohol or drug use are choosing to abstain, as a result of the knowledge that they could be tested, leading to a reduction in the number of positive drug tests, whereas those who are alcohol or drug dependent continue to consume on a regular basis.\n[167] Common sense dictates that individuals with control over their alcohol or drug use would, at a minimum, be more careful about their consumption if they knew that they were at risk of an unannounced alcohol or drug test in the workplace. There is, however, insufficient evidence before us to conclude that the presence of an alcohol or drug testing policy would deter employees with substance abuse problems from continuing to use alcohol or drugs. Further, the fact that the presence of a drug testing policy may serve to discourage the alcohol or drug dependent from applying to work at a specific company is evidence of the potentially systemic discriminatory effect that such policies can have.\n(i) Conclusions Regarding the use of Drug Testing By Autocar Connaisseur [168] It is clear from the testimony of Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson that there is no single, ideal means of detecting employee impairment, or of identifying those who are at increased risk of being intoxicated in the workplace. While the approach advocated by Dr. Baker is a good one, in principle, it is clear from the evidence of Dr. Chiasson that it will not necessarily catch all of those employees who are at risk of putting the lives of passengers in jeopardy. We are also not persuaded that, in the specific context in which Autocar Connaisseur found itself during the summer of 1999, that Dr. Baker\u2019s method would have been all that workable.\n[169] First of all, Dr. Baker\u2019s approach relies to a large extent upon the observations of supervisors. While such an approach may work well in a factory or office environment, where employees are closely supervised, it is less useful in a work environment such as that at Autocar Connaisseur, where bus drivers are unsupervised for much of the time.\n[170] Dr. Baker\u2019s approach is also costly. He testified that a pre-employment employee assessment would cost between $500 to $800 per employee. We know that Autocar Connaisseur has a transient workforce, and hires many of its employees on a seasonal basis. We also know that the company was losing money at the time that Mr. Milazzo was tested, and was in danger of being shut down altogether. While we do not have evidence as to the precise cost of administering a urine test to an employee, Dr. Chiasson did tell us that the process is cheap, and was obviously within the means of Autocar Connaisseur.\n[171] Although a positive drug test does not indicate that a bus driver was actually impaired while on the job, for the reasons discussed earlier in this decision, we are satisfied that a positive test result is a red flag, to use Dr. Chiasson\u2019s term. The presence of cannabis metabolite in an employee\u2019s urine does assist in identifying drivers who are at an elevated risk of accident.\n[172] We have also found that the presence of a drug testing policy will serve to deter at least some employees from using alcohol or drugs in the workplace, in a manner that would put themselves or others in danger.\n[173] For these reasons, we find that Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s drug testing policy is reasonably necessary to accomplish the company\u2019s legitimate work-related goal of promoting road safety.\n[174] There is one further reason why we have concluded that Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s drug testing policy is reasonably necessary, and that is the company\u2019s obligation to comply with American drug testing legislation. Counsel for the Commission suggested that Autocar Connaisseur should maintain two pools of drivers, one for drivers going to the United States, and a second for those driving exclusively in Canada. Only drivers going on American routes should then be subject to alcohol and drug testing. Based upon the testimony of Mr. Crowe, Mr. Filiatrault and Mr. Devlin, however, we do not think that this is a workable solution. It is clear that to remain competitive, Autocar Connaisseur has to have drivers available to allow the company to respond to customer demand in a timely manner. In addition, the company also has to be able to respond quickly to inclement weather conditions and emergency situations. We are satisfied that in a small company such as Autocar Connaisseur, all drivers have the reasonable potential for crossing the border,[35] and that it would cause Autocar Connaisseur undue hardship if it could not test all of its drivers in accordance with American legislative requirements.\n[175] For these reasons, we find that Autocar Connaisseur has met the burden on it of establishing that subjecting its employees to pre-employment and random drug testing is a legitimate way to promote road safety.\n[176] That is not the end of the matter, however. According to the Supreme Court decisions in Meiorin and Grismer, in order to satisfy the third element of the bona fide occupational requirement defense, Autocar Connaisseur must also show that it is impossible for it to accommodate employees who test positive for drugs, and who suffer from a drug-related disability, without imposing undue hardship on the company. This issue will be considered next.\n(j) Can Autocar Connaisseur Accommodate Bus Drivers Who Have Tested Positive? [177] In accordance with Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s drug testing policy, any employee testing positive for either alcohol or drugs will be summarily terminated. Where a prospective employee tests positive, Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s offer of employment will be withdrawn.\n[178] It will be recalled that Mr. Devlin testified that Autocar Connaisseur was of the view that these actions are necessary because an employee who knowingly comes to work with alcohol or drugs in his system so fundamentally breaches the trust between employer and employee that there is no alternative but to terminate the employment relationship. It may well be that such a course is open to Autocar Connaisseur (at least from a human rights perspective) where employees use alcohol or drugs as a matter of personal choice, and voluntarily breach the company\u2019s alcohol and drug policy.\n[179] The situation is different, however, in cases where the individual suffers from a condition that qualifies as a disability. In such cases, an employer has an obligation to accommodate the employee to the point of undue hardship, unless it is impossible to do so.\n[180] The fact that an employee tests positive in an employer-sponsored drug test does not automatically mean that the employee is disabled. In order to distinguish between employees who suffer from a substance-related disability and those who do not, it may well be necessary to require that the employee submit to a professional assessment by an appropriate health care practitioner. While employers must be sensitive to the role that denial can play in substance abuse disorders, ultimately, the onus is on the employee or prospective employee to demonstrate that they are entitled to the protection of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[181] We do not accept Mr. Devlin\u2019s evidence that Autocar Connaisseur could not accommodate alcohol or drug dependent employees or prospective employees who test positive in random or pre-employment alcohol or drug tests. Mr. Devlin himself acknowledged that the company can and does accommodate employees who voluntarily come forward and admit to having an alcohol or drug problem. In such cases, Mr. Devlin says, employees will be given the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, and will be allowed to return to work when they are fit to do so. Mr. Devlin confirmed that the company was prepared to offer this form of accommodation even though he assumes that an employee with an alcohol or drug problem would, in all likelihood, have driven a bus while his ability to do so was impaired. Surely driving a passenger bus while impaired is at least as serious a breach of trust as testing positive in an alcohol or drug test?\n[182] Further, Mr. Devlin\u2019s position with respect to the need for there to be voluntary self- disclosure before any effort will be made by the company to accommodate a substance-dependent employee ignores the very real role that denial plays in alcohol or drug related disorders.\n[183] Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson each discussed the role that denial plays in substance abuse disorders. Both doctors agree that addicts will continue to deny that they have a problem until the personal cost of using alcohol or drugs outweighs the benefits of continued use. In most cases, Dr. Chiasson says, it will take a crisis such as the loss of a job or spouse before a person who is dependent on either alcohol or drugs will confront the fact that they have a problem, and seek help. Dr. Chiasson testified that he has never seen a situation where an addict spontaneously had a crisis of conscience, and came forward voluntarily seeking help.\n[184] While we have found that a positive alcohol or drug test is a red flag, that is, an indication that the employee presents an elevated risk of accident, the safety concerns raised by the test results can be addressed by removing the driver from behind the wheel of a bus.[36] In light of the safety concerns created by the positive test result, however, we do not think it appropriate to require Autocar Connaisseur to assign the driver to a Canadian route as a form of accommodation. In any event, we have already concluded that the operational demands at Autocar Connaisseur are such that there can be no assurance that a driver assigned to a Canadian route would not have to drive into the United States on short notice.\n[185] Given the testimony as to the small size of the company, the limited number of non- driving positions available, and the specialized training that these positions require, it may well be that there are no alternate, non-driving positions available for bus drivers at Autocar Connaisseur.\n[186] At the very minimum, however, a company such as Autocar Connaisseur should be able to extend the same opportunity to a substance-dependent driver who has tested positive as it does to drivers who come forward voluntarily with substance abuse problems. That is, these individuals should be afforded the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, and to return to work when they are fit to do so. In our view, the company would also be justified in implementing appropriate follow-up monitoring measures to ensure that the individual continues to abstain from the use of alcohol or drugs. Finally, Autocar Connaisseur may also be able to terminate the employment of those individuals who fail to rehabilitate themselves after being afforded the reasonable opportunity to do so, although each of these situations would have to be carefully considered, on a case-by-case basis.\n[187] In the case of prospective employees suffering from drug-related disabilities who test positive in pre-employment tests, employers are not entitled to automatically withdraw offers of employment, without first addressing the issue of accommodation. It may be that in some cases no accommodation will be possible where, for example, the candidate is being hired to meet an immediate, short-term need, and the period of time off of work required to complete a program of rehabilitation would be longer than the term of the employment. In other situations, some form of accommodation may be possible. Each situation would have to be carefully assessed on a case- by-case basis.\n(k) Findings Regarding Liability and the Section 10 complaint [188] Under the Meiorin and Grismer decisions, the burden is on Autocar Connaisseur to establish that its non-accommodating standard is reasonably necessary to achieve its goal of promoting road safety.[37] While Autocar Connaisseur has justified its policy of subjecting its bus drivers to pre-employment and random drug tests, it has not satisfied the burden on it of demonstrating that it could not accommodate bus drivers who have tested positive for alcohol or drugs and are alcohol or drug dependent. Accordingly, Mr. Milazzo\u2019s section 10 complaint is sustained.\n(l) Comments Regarding Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s New Alcohol and Drug Testing Policy [189] Before turning to the question of remedy, we wish to make a brief comment with respect to Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s new alcohol and drug testing policy. It will be recalled that this policy, which only came into force in March of this year, applies not just to bus drivers, but to bus mechanics as well. This policy is not the subject of Mr. Milazzo\u2019s complaint, and, in our view, we would be overstepping our jurisdiction if we were to extend the scope of our inquiry to include a consideration of the legality of testing mechanics.[38] Accordingly, we make no finding regarding Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s new policy, and specifically with respect to the question of whether the testing of Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s bus mechanics is reasonably necessary.\nVIII. Remedy [190] Having found that Autocar Connaisseur has not met the burden on it with respect to the section 10 complaint, it remains to be determined what the appropriate remedy should be. Where a respondent is found to have engaged in a discriminatory policy or practice, the Tribunal will ordinarily order the respondent to immediately cease committing the discriminatory practice. In this case, if it is to continue doing business in the United States, Autocar Connaisseur must continue to test its bus drivers. What it cannot continue to do is to automatically withdraw an offer of employment or terminate the employment of drivers who test positive in employer- sponsored drug tests, where those employees or prospective employees can establish that they suffer from substance-related disabilities.\n[191] We therefore direct Autocar Connaisseur to immediately cease the discriminatory practice of failing to accommodate employees or prospective employees who test positive in company- sponsored drug tests, in cases where the individual can establish that he suffers from a substance- related disability.\n[192] We further direct Autocar Connaisseur to take steps, in consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, to formulate a drug testing policy that ensures that drug dependent employees or prospective employees who suffer from drug-related disabilities, who test positive in employer-sponsored drug tests, are accommodated, to the point of undue hardship, in accordance with this decision.\n[193] We further direct that, within six months of the date of this decision, the parties shall file with the Tribunal a copy of Autocar Connaisseur's revised drug testing policy. In the event that the parties are unable to agree with respect to any of the terms of this revised policy, the Tribunal retains jurisdiction to deal with any outstanding issues.\nIX. Order [194] For the foregoing reasons, we declare that Autocar Connaisseur\u2019s alcohol and drug testing policy discriminates on the basis of disability, contrary to the provisions of section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and order that:\nAutocar Connaisseur immediately cease the discriminatory practice of automatically withdrawing an offer of employment or terminating the employment of drivers suffering from substance-related disabilities who test positive in an employer-sponsored drug test. Autocar Connaisseur take steps, in consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, to formulate a policy that ensures that individuals who suffer from substance-related disabilities who test positive in employer-sponsored drug tests are accommodated to the point of undue hardship, in accordance with this decision Within six months of this decision, the parties shall file with the Tribunal copies of Autocar Connaisseur's revised drug testing policy. If the parties are unable to agree with respect to any of the terms of the revised policy, the Tribunal retains jurisdiction to deal with any outstanding issues.\n[195] Mr. Milazzo\u2019s section 7 complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nAnne L. Mactavish Chairperson\nPierre Deschamps Member\nMichel Doucet Member\nOttawa, Ontario November 6, 2003\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T713\/1802\nStyle of Cause: Salvatore Milazzo v. Autocar Connaisseur Inc. et al.\nDecision of the Tribunal Dated: November 6, 2003\nDate and Place of Hearing:\nNovember 25-26, 2002 March 24-25, 2003 April 23-24, 2003 May 20-21, 2003 June 2-4, 2003\nMontreal, Quebec\nAppearances:\nSalvatore Milazzo, on his own behalf\nPatrick O\u2019Rourke and C\u00e9line Harrington, for the Canadian Human Rights Commission\nLouise Baillargeon and Philippe-Andr\u00e9 Tessier, for the Respondent\nGeorge Vuicic, for the Interested Party\n[1] Mr. Milazzo testified that while he worked at Autocar Connaisseur, the company had between 150 and 200 employees driving buses in the summer months, and only 40 or 50 drivers working during the winter. Autocar Connaisseur witnesses testified that at the time Mr. Milazzo\u2019s employment with the company was terminated, it employed 115 drivers in peak season. As a result of a downturn in the travel industry, Autocar Connaisseur now only employs approximately 40 bus drivers during its busy period.\n[2] It should be noted that although Mr. Milazzo asked for a second drug test in the course of his meeting with M. Bougie, neither the Commission nor Mr. Milazzo challenged the validity of the results of Mr. Milazzo's drug test at the hearing.\n[3] R.S.Q. 1998, ch. 40\n[4] R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2\n[5] R.S.C. 1985, c. 29 (3rd Supp.)\n[6] Ms. Butler explained that transportation companies can require a driver to undergo alcohol and drug testing where the company has a reasonable suspicion that the driver is unfit for duty due to drug or alcohol use.\n[7] Although it is not entirely clear from the evidence, it appears that Mr. Booth worked for Coach U.S.A.'s Canadian interests (Coach Canada), rather than for Autocar Connaisseur itself.\n[8] [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3\n[9] [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868\n[10] Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v.

Imperial Oil Ltd., 50 O.R. (3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 104, for a discussion of this issue.\n[18] It should be noted that the Commission abandoned its support of Mr. Milazzo's section 7 complaint mid-way through the hearing, and made no submissions as to whether Mr. Milazzo suffered from a disability or not. Mr. Milazzo, who did not attend the last several days of the hearing, made no submissions in this regard.\n[19] This metabolite is properly described as 11-nor-?-9-THC-9-COOH.\n[20] It is reasonable to assume that this was indeed the case: we know that Mr. Milazzo had several days warning that he was going to undergo a drug test. If Mr. Milazzo was indeed a casual user of cannabis (and therefore in control of his drug use), common sense would dictate that he would refrain from using cannabis in the period immediately before the test.\n[21] In coming to this conclusion, we have considered the possibility that Mr. Milazzo's denial of the seriousness of his drug problem could itself be symptomatic of a drug-related disability. However, we note that having lost his job because of his drug use, Mr. Milazzo has faced the kind of crisis that can force a drug dependent individual face up to his disability, and nevertheless continues to maintain that he is not drug dependent. Further, he maintains this position even though it would clearly have been in his interest to claim that he suffered from a disability at the hearing.\n[22] [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665\n[23] R.S.Q. c. C-12, as amended.\n[24] (1994) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/89 (C.H.R.T.), aff'd (1996) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/139 (F.C.T.D.)\n[25] Meiorin, supra., at para. 43-44\n[26] We note that our finding that an employer drug testing policy is prima facie discriminatory is consistent with the existing Canadian human rights jurisprudence in this area. See, for example, Entrop, supra, Canadian Civil Liberties Association v. Toronto Dominion Bank, (1997) 163 D.L.R. (4th) 193 (F.C.A.), and Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission) v. Elizabeth M\u00e9tis Settlement, 2003 ABQB 342.\n[27] Meiorin, supra., at para. 59\n[28] It will be recalled that Mr. Milazzo himself had a criminal record, as a result of his 1997 impaired driving conviction, but was nonetheless able to enter the United States in the summer of 1999. Mr. Milazzo suggested that a conviction for impaired driving might not interfere with his ability to cross the border. In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that the border authorities were ever aware of his record.\n[29] M. Brault was not offered as an expert witness, and was not qualified as such. The Tribunal allowed M. Brault to refer to previous SAAQ research, but given his status as a lay witness, did not allow him to offer opinions as to the conclusions that could be drawn from the research. M. Brault was not cross-examined with respect to the statistical information, however, and the evidence is uncontradicted. Similar statistical information with respect to the Quebec study was also provided by Barbara Butler. Accordingly, the Tribunal is prepared to accept this evidence.\n[30] NIDA is an acronym for the National Institute of Drug Abuse. It is common ground that Mr. Milazzo's urine was tested for the NIDA 5 group of drugs.\n[31] 11-nor- -9-THC-9-COOH is also called THC-acid or THC-carboxylate.\n[32] While Dr. Baker testified that over-the-counter medications are the commonest source of employee impairment, Barbara Butler says that cannabis is the most frequently identified drug in any studies of unsafe driving practices.\n[33] The Canadian Human Rights Commission Policy on Alcohol and Drug Testing. Online: CHRC Homepage http:\/\/www.chrc-ccdp.ca\/Legis&Poli\/DrgTPol_PolSLDrg\/DrgPol_PolDrg2.asp?l=e. It should be noted that the Tribunal has previously ruled that the Commission's policy is not binding on the Tribunal, and is nothing more than a statement of the Commission's opinion on the issue of drug and alcohol testing, an opinion that the Tribunal may agree with or not, as it sees fit. (See Milazzo v. Autocar Connaisseur Inc., T-713\/1802, Ruling No. 1, (Nov. 12, 2002))\n[34] As was previously noted, in an earlier SAAQ study, 4.8% of drivers of commercial vehicles tested positive for cannabis metabolites.\n[35] Mr. Milazzo and Mr. Filiatrault both testified that Mr. Calci would restrict drivers with criminal records to Canadian routes. This certainly indicates that it is possible to accommodate a specific individual with a known restriction that would prevent him from crossing the border by trying to have him drive only in Canada. However, it is clear from Mr. Milazzo's own experience that this was not always possible. Indeed, he was called upon to drive to the United States on short notice, even though his employer was aware that he had a criminal record, because no other driver was available.\n[36] American Department of Transport Regulations require that an employee who tests positive for either alcohol or drugs be removed from a safety-sensitive position. Nothing in the American legislation, however, requires that the employer terminate the individual's employment. Indeed, the American Omnibus Transportation Employees Testing Act of 1991 (49 USCS 31306 (b)(1)(A)), under whose authority the Regulations are promulgated, recognizes the critical role that rehabilitation plays in any testing program.\n[37] See, for example, Grismer, supra., at p. 886.\n[38] See Entrop, supra. at paras. 44 to 59. It should also be noted that the Commission took the position at the hearing that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider Autocar Connaisseur's new drug testing policy, and that very little time was spent by either party on the question of the propriety of testing mechanics.\n",

Warren Gibson Limited, the respondent, is a large trucking company located in Alliston, Ontario. Ms. Laronde was hired as a driver of tractor trucks on the U.S. board running from Canada to the United States and back. She started as a full time probationary employee on May 4, 1994 and became permanent on April 12, 1995. Tractor trucks are large trucks with sleeping accommodation in the rear of the cab. Ms. Laronde worked at Gibson until October 2, 1996, when Gibson terminated her employment.\n[2] Before her termination, Ms. Laronde had filed a complaint dated August 23, 1996 with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In her complaint, Ms. Laronde alleged that Gibson had, during her employment, disciplined her more harshly than the male drivers for similar incidents, and had denied her promotions, in breach of s.7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. She also alleged that Gibson discriminated against her by failing to provide a harassment free workplace contrary to s.14 of the Act.\nII. FACTS [3] Gibson is headquartered in Alliston, Ontario. In its trucking operations, it has four drivers boards, the U.S. board, the Windsor board, the local board and the floater board. Drivers on the U.S. board run cross border from Alliston to the U.S. and return; on the Windsor board from Alliston to Windsor, return; the local board, which involves runs within Canada, usually within a 100-mile radius; and, the floater board which has drivers not assigned to any of the other boards.\n[4] Gibson started out a small trucking company with about five trucks hauling tobacco, feed corn, basically, farm products. When Honda Canada built its assembly plant near Alliston, Gibson became its primary carrier for automotive parts. Honda now accounts for about 75 per cent of Gibson's business. Gibson has grown to about 700 employees today. When Ms. Laronde worked there, Gibson had approximately 250 drivers.\n[5] Honda's operations are geared to just-in-time delivery. Honda does not have a warehouse facility for automotive parts at its assembly plant. Parts are delivered by trailer to Honda and the trailers are assembled in a designated area. When parts are needed for the assembly line, the trailer is moved to the loading dock, and the parts, which are on racking, are wheeled off the trailer directly onto the assembly line.\n[6] Just-in-time delivery involves a window time. A window time is the time scheduled by which the driver must deliver the trailer to the customer. Given the importance of just-in-time delivery for its customers, Gibson has adopted the motto on time, every time, which is drilled into all of its drivers. Conformance to this motto is the basis for Gibson's success.\nA. GIBSON DISCIPLINARY RULES AND PROCEDURES [7] When Ms. Laronde started at Gibson in 1994, Gibson had in place a handbook of Rules and Regulations, which set out the standards and expectations Gibson had for its employees. This was given to each driver when hired and a copy was posted in the drivers room. In June 1995, Gibson hired Marilyn Lawrence as Manager, Human Resources. Shortly after she started, Ms. Lawrence modified and updated the Rules and Regulations to provide for a system of progressive discipline which came into effect around August 1995.\n[8] Under the progressive disciplinary procedures, disciplinary offenses are classified as unexcused, major and minor. Under each of these classifications, there is a list of this type of conduct that is considered to be an offense under the particular classification.\n[9] The Rules also provide for step up penalties. For an unexcused offense, the penalty is immediate suspension without pay, with intent to terminate. For a first major offense, the penalty is a written warning; a final written warning for a second offense, and termination for a third offense. Minor offenses call for a courtesy warning, then a written warning, a final written warning and termination of employment.\n[10] In all cases, before issuing a final written warning, the employee's work record must be reviewed by their dispatcher and the Manager, Human Resources. Before terminating an employee, this same review must include another member of management. Extenuating circumstances will be considered.\n[11] In addition to these discipline categories, there is also a classification for logbook violations. Logbook violations are treated as a major offense. Without getting into all of the complexities relating to logbooks, it is enough to point out that government regulations, both in Canada and in the United States, require every driver to maintain a logbook for each trip. Departure time, on and off duty time, distance travelled in a particular day, the date and time they started the run, must all be recorded in the logbook. On duty time includes driving time and loading and unloading time. Off duty time is lunch, dinner, and sleeping time or other times when the driver is out of the truck, but not loading or unloading.\n[12] Canadian regulations allow 13 hours of continuous driving time and a maximum of 15 hours driving and on duty time. There is some flexibility for heavy traffic or severe weather conditions. When a driver has reached 15 hours, they must go off duty for eight hours and then can resume the 15-hour cycle. The U.S. regulations provide for a maximum of 10 hours continuous driving and a maximum of 15 hours on duty driving.\n[13] At the end of each run, drivers hand in their logbooks to Gibson's safety department which run a computer-generated monthly report for each driver. If the printout from the safety department shows that the driver had exceeded their hours, the driver would be notified and asked to discuss it with the safety director. If the driver does not give a reasonable explanation, the driver would be disciplined for an over hours or hours of service violation.\n[14] Both preventable and non-preventable accidents are also recorded on a driver's disciplinary record. Preventable accidents are not specifically listed as an offense in the Rules and it is not clear how they are treated in terms of discipline.\n[15] Disciplinary offenses on an employee's record fall off after one year and are not considered for disciplinary action. Logbook violations are not taken into account after six months.\nB. APPEALS TO THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE [16] If a driver has not followed the Rules and Regulations, normally, their dispatcher will write up a Drivers Incident Report (DIR). However, anyone in a supervisory or management position at Gibson can write a DIR. The DIR documents the date and details of the incident, the driver's name, the name of the person writing the report, the problem, the company standard and what the resolution should be. The driver can give a written response on the DIR or can respond orally as to their version. The matter is reviewed by Ms. Lawrence, and if the driver does not dispute the DIR, Ms. Lawrence will rate the incident according to the appropriate disciplinary classification, and records it on the driver's disciplinary file.\n[17] If the driver does dispute it, Ms. Lawrence will discuss it with whoever wrote the DIR so that she has a complete understanding of the incident. If there is no merit to the DIR, no disciplinary offense is recorded and there are no negative consequences.\n[18] If Ms. Lawrence decides otherwise, the driver is informed and may appeal to the management committee. The management committee is composed of management representatives and driver representatives, the latter nominated by their peers. However, anyone in the company can attend at management committee meetings and participate in the discussion of the incident and how it should be treated. The management committee meets once a month to discuss anything of concern to the company including appeals. At the meeting, after discussion, the committee can confirm the incident and\/or the penalty, reverse it or substitute another result. Management can override any decision of the committee, although, according to Ms. Lawrence, this tends to be the exception, not the rule. Minutes are taken for all of the management committee meetings.\nC. THE THREE ELEMENTS OF THE COMPLAINT (i) Adverse Differential Treatment, s.7(b) of the Act [19] The Commission alleges that Ms. Laronde was adversely differentiated in her employment because she was disciplined more harshly for similar incidents than male drivers at Gibson. The Commission called evidence relating to ten incidents, which it argues, supports this contention.\na) Alleged Incidents of Adverse Differential Treatment 1. June 12, 1995 - taking truck home - penalty-loss of half of Good Guy bonus [20] On June 12, 1995, Ms. Laronde was written up in a DIR for taking her truck home, which involved 25 off-route miles. Ms. Laronde testified that she was on her way back from Ohio when she got a speeding ticket. A conviction would not show well on her driving record and she believed that she had a good defense.\n[21] She had to return to Ohio for her court date the next day at 11 a.m., but did not have time to drop the truck in Alliston, go home, pick up suitable clothes for court and return to Ohio. So she drove the truck to her home, stopped for no more than five minutes, and returned the truck to the Gibson yard, picked up her car and drove eight hours to Ohio for her court date. The speeding charge was dismissed.\n[22] According to the Rules, taking the truck home is considered an unauthorized use of a company vehicle and is classified as an unexcused offense. Ms. Laronde appealed to the management committee, and explained the situation. The management committee at its meeting on July 28, 1995, recommended that she not be given any penalty. Management, however, overruled the committee and decided that she lose her December good guy bonus of $400. This was reduced to $200 by the management committee at its August 11, 1995 meeting. The good guy bonus is a bonus of $400 given twice yearly in July and December to recognize drivers doing a good job.\nComparators\n[23] The Commission compared this penalty to that received by male drivers at Gibson for the same offense. The minutes of the March 8, 1994 management committee meeting show that Jim Barnes had been taking his truck home at night after being asked previous times not to do so. He was charged $50, the cost to boost the truck battery, which was deducted from his good guy bonus. The meeting minutes also emphasized the company policy that trucks are not to be taken home and there are no exceptions to this policy.\n[24] Bob Watt, once a driver and safety director at Gibson, testified that Mr. Barnes regularly took his truck home, and continued to do so, but was only disciplined that one time. Mr. Watt said that he himself took his truck home a couple of times and was never disciplined.\n[25] Charlie Ward was written up in a DIR dated March 21, 1996, for travelling off-route and stopping at his home. He lost his good guy bonus for June 1996, and received a final warning that a repeat would result in immediate termination.\n[26] Don Smalley took his truck home regularly and was never disciplined. The company's explanation was that Mr. Smalley lived on Highway 89, which was on the route that the Gibson drivers take when they begin their runs. Apparently, this was acceptable because Mr. Smalley did not run off-route, although there is no on-route exception in the Rules.\n2. August 15, 1995 - Driving off-route - no discipline [27] On August 15, 1995, Ms. Laronde was driving north on Highway 50 pulling a 53-foot trailer. She was told that there was an accident in the village of Loretto and the highway was blocked. To avoid this, she took the fifth concession side road. Along the way she met Bing Gibson who was driving southbound on the same side road. They both stopped, Ms. Laronde explained the situation and then went on her way. Bing Gibson wrote up a DIR for this incident. Ms. Laronde provided an explanation. No disciplinary action was taken.\n3. May 9, 1996 - Hisan - customer complaint - note to file and apology [28] Ms. Laronde's account of this incident is that she arrived at Hisan, a parts manufacturer in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, around nine a.m. She parked her truck at the loading dock, went to see Scott, the shipper\/receiver, to deal with the status of the load and paperwork. She knew him because she had been to Mt. Vernon a number of times. Scott was talking to another employee (who turned out to be his wife) at the time. After waiting a few minutes, and to get his attention, Ms. Laronde grabbed a comb that was sticking out of his back pocket. She also noticed he had two scratches on his arm and touched his arm commenting nice job. Shortly after, Ms. Laronde went to the lunchroom to complete her paperwork. Scott's wife came to the lunchroom and according to Ms. Laronde, yelled at her for doing what she did. Ms. Laronde did not consider her actions of any consequence or why this Hisan employee had become so agitated. She completed her paperwork, left Hisan and telephoned Ms. Lawrence to report the matter.\n[29] Ms. Lawrence also received a telephone call from the Manager of Human Resources at Hisan, who told her that one of her team leaders had reported that Ms. Laronde had manipulated a comb in the back pocket of a male worker and had caressed his arm. The incident had been reported to the plant manager who requested that Ms. Laronde not return to the Hisan plant. Ms. Lawrence assured them that Gibson would meet this request and would also recommend that Ms. Laronde apologize to all parties involved. After talking to Ms. Laronde, Ms. Lawrence called the Human Resources Manager back and told her that she had spoken to Ms. Laronde.\n[30] Ms. Lawrence wrote up the incident as a major offense. Ms. Laronde disagreed very strongly and appealed to the management committee. At the June 28, 1996 management committee meeting, Ms. Laronde told her story. The committee decided that this should not be rated as a major, but rather as a note to file. Ms. Laronde was required to send a letter of apology to Hisan, which she did.\nComparators\n[31] The Commission asked that the Hisan incident and discipline be compared to what it considered to be similar incidents involving male drivers at Gibson. On April 25, 1996, Brenda Mckee at Honda called Ms. Lawrence to tell her that a female employee had complained that whenever David Cleary, a Gibson driver, was at Honda, he deliberately went out of his way to locate her and stare at her. He did not talk to her or have any physical contact with her. But she felt very uncomfortable and reported this to her team leader, who had also observed Mr. Cleary's conduct. Honda did not ask that Mr. Cleary be disciplined or that he not return to Honda, but that he be told that such conduct was unacceptable.\n[32] Ms. Lawrence spoke to Mr. Cleary about the complaint. His response was he did not think he was causing a problem and was only looking at the assembly process. He was told by Ms. Lawrence that any further complaint would result in disciplinary action. He agreed to stop what he had been doing. He was not required to apologize.\n[33] The second incident referred to by the Commission is the case of HW, a Gibson driver. HW was written up in a DIR dated January 20, 1997 because of a written complaint from a Hillsdale Tool Division employee. The employee said that she was offended by remarks made by HW. HW did not deny making the remarks, but said that they were made during a conversation between HW, the complainant, and her co-worker. The remarks were in jest and not intended to offend. The DIR shows that HW had five previous incidents, the details of which are not in evidence. HW was required to send a letter of apology to the complainant and was given a final warning that a repeat would result in immediate termination.\n[34] The third incident involved another Gibson driver R.M. According to the June 14, 1995 DIR, Gibson received a complaint from Harry at Meiko Transport, that management at MEI had reported that RM had spoken to a security guard in a loud and abusive voice and was snippy. MEI suggested that Meiko stop using Gibson as a carrier. Gibson considered this to be proven discourtesy to a customer. RM was spoken to by Ms. Lawrence and lost his good guy bonus.\n[35] Finally, there is the DIR for Scott McWilliams dated October 2, 1996. The DIR does not give the details of this incident. The evidence is that Mr. McWilliams had behaviour issues. He also had three previous incidents. Mr. McWilliams was suspended for two weeks without pay, was put on six months probation and was not to receive a good guy bonus in that period. He also received a final warning.\n4. June 6, 1996 - overslept - late delivery - major offense [36] The June 6, 1996 DIR shows that Ms. Laronde overslept and was late for a Windsor switch scheduled for seven a.m. Because of the delay, the Windsor switch driver had to be paid for waiting time. Ms. Laronde explained that she was driving back from Ohio with a load for Honda. On the initial run down to Ohio, Ms. Laronde was delayed by bad weather. She made her window time to Ohio, but when she started the run back, she had reached her maximum hours. She decided to stop and sleep for two hours and when she woke up she realized that she would be late for the Windsor switch. She contacted her dispatcher and told him that she would be about an hour late. She made the switch around eight a.m. In fact, the switch trailer from Ohio was delivered at the scheduled window time to Honda.\n[37] This incident was rated as a major, the disciplinary offense under the Rules being, arriving late for a window time without a reasonable explanation. Ms. Laronde appealed to the management committee. Her position was that she did not miss a window time because her trailer was delivered on time to Honda. If the violation was that the switch driver had to be paid waiting time, her response what that U.S. waiting time was only paid after the first hour.\n[38] The management committee at its June 28, 1996 meeting did not accept her explanation and confirmed the offense as a major. The company's position was that there is no distinction made between a switch time within the Rules. According to Ms. Lawrence, Ms. Laronde was not disciplined because the switch driver was paid waiting time. She was disciplined because of the late switch. A late is a late.\nComparator\n[39] Compare this, the Commission argues with the June 27, 1996 DIR for Mike Rumble. Mr. Rumble left too late in the evening to make his seven a.m. window time. He was not disciplined for this incident. Instead, the dispatcher noted on the DIR that this was the first time Mr. Rumble had an incident like this. Because there was no customer complaint, it should be treated only as a note to file. Ms. Lawrence's evidence was that she did not deal with this matter because it was dealt with and resolved by the dispatcher. There is no evidence or any explanation given as to why Mr. Rumble left too late to make the window time.\n5. June 18, 1996 - late delivery Honda - major offense [40] The DIR for June 18, 1996 refers to a late U.S. delivery to MEI by Ms. Laronde on June 17, 1996. The window time was scheduled for nine a.m. Monday, but Ms. Laronde did not make the delivery until noon. Ms. Laronde's explanation was that she had informed dispatch, that on the previous Friday, that she strained her back and wanted to spend the weekend to recover. Normally she would leave around midday on Sunday for her next run. Her dispatcher told her that he would try and find a load so that she could leave later on Sunday evening or early Monday morning. But when she had reported for work, she was dispatched with a trap load. A trap load is a load for three or more customers. The driver must deal with a custom broker for each customer's load. More time is required to prepare the paperwork and get customs clearance. Ms. Laronde was delayed for about two hours at the border and thus missed the window time.\n[41] Ms. Laronde did not appeal this incident. The reason, she said, was because the previous time she appealed a late delivery, she was unsuccessful.\n6. June 28, 1996 - Final warning [42] On July 3, 1996, Ms. Laronde received a written final warning from Ms. Lawrence, dated June 28, 1996. Ms. Lawrence's evidence was that the reason for the final warning was the accumulation of incidents from January 1996 to June 1996, which indicated that Ms. Laronde's overall performance was not up to standard. Earlier, on June 20, 1996 Ms. Laronde met with Ms. Lawrence and Willie Teigesser, her dispatcher. The purpose of the meeting was to point out to Ms. Laronde that, in a short period of time, she had accumulated a number of major offenses and her job was in jeopardy. Ms. Lawrence saw this meeting as an attempt to help Ms. Laronde.\n[43] Ms. Lawrence documented the meeting in a memorandum dated June 20, 1996. There she noted that Ms. Laronde had four majors and one preventable accident on her disciplinary record. She also noted that company policy provided that an employee may be terminated after three majors, but before taking such action, Ms. Lawrence felt obliged to make Ms. Laronde aware of the status of her file.\n[44] At the June 20th meeting, Ms. Laronde told Ms. Lawrence that she disagreed with two of the offenses, the May 9, 1996 Hisan and the June 6, 1996 overslept late delivery and that she had appealed both to the management committee meeting scheduled for June 28, 1996.\n[45] As noted earlier, the management committee, at their meeting, reduced the Hisan incident from a major to a note on file, but left the June 6, 1996 - overslept, late delivery as a major. In the result when the final warning was issued on June 28, 1996, Ms. Lawrence had three major offenses and a preventable accident. One of the majors, the January 31, 1996 hours of service of violation (for which no explanation or evidence has been offered) was to drop off of Ms. Laronde's disciplinary record in two days, on June 30, 1996. Thus, by my reckoning, as of July 3, 1996 when she actually received the final warning, Ms. Laronde had two majors and a preventable accident.\nComparator\n[46] The Commission argued that Ms. Laronde's final warning, when compared to the discipline received by Steve Semple, one of Gibson's drivers, is another example of adverse differential treatment by Gibson.\n[47] On April 13, 1996 Mr. Semple and Bill Grange, another Gibson driver, were running together, each driving a Gibson truck. They stopped for dinner and had consumed alcohol during their dinner. The Rules provide that it is an unexcused offense for a driver to be under the influence of alcohol or to consume alcohol within eight hours of operating a motor vehicle. Mr. Grange had an accident, which caused about $100,000 damage to his truck.\n[48] Initially, both drivers lied about the drinking, but it was later reported to the company by another Gibson employee that one of the trucks had been seen parked outside a bar and not at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant as reported by the two drivers.\n[49] When the management committee met on April 26, 1996 to review this matter, Mr. Semple admitted that he had been drinking and that he had lied about the incident. Mr. Semple had earlier been suspended for two weeks without pay and the management committee suspended him for another week without pay. He was also given a final warning that any further major incident would result in immediate termination.\n[50] Ms. Lawrence testified that Mr. Semple was not terminated because he was not involved in the accident. Although he had lied at first, he did come forward and admit that he had broken the eight-hour drinking rule. According to Ms. Lawrence, that was the only company Rule that he had breached.\n[51] In addition to the drinking incident, which is an unexcused offense, Mr. Semple's disciplinary record shows speeding, 96\/80, on June 6, 1995, a major offense. It also shows an hour of service violation on January 31, 1996, a major offense, and an in-bond load offense on March 11, 1996. It is not clear from the company's Rules how this offense is classified.\n[52] On July 23, 1996, Ms. Laronde received two hours of service violations. However, these notices referred to a May 13, 1996 and a June 6, 1996 incident. Because the safety department was behind in its work, these notices of violation were only issued in late July.\n[53] Thus, by July 23, 1996, Ms. Laronde had accumulated four majors. In such case, the Rules call for termination. But Ms. Laronde was not terminated at this time. According to Ms. Lawrence, because the notices were issued late, they would not count against the final warning.\n[54] There is no evidence explaining the details relating to the May 13, 1996 and the June 6, 1996 over-hours violations. Although the notices could have been appealed, Ms. Laronde did not do so. She also refused to sign receipt of the notices.\n7. July 25, 1996 - late delivery - no disciplinary offense [55] Ms. Laronde was dispatched to pick up a rail container in Welland, drop it off and be at work at JCI, a Gibson customer, for 8 a.m. JCI called dispatch at 8:45 a.m. and advised that Ms. Laronde had not yet arrived. A DIR was written up for being late and Ms. Laronde explained that because of her logbook hours, she could not leave early enough to make the pickup in Welland and be back at JCI by eight a.m. Her explanation was accepted and she did not receive any disciplinary offense.\n8. August 2, 1996 - discourteous to dispatch - minor offense and apology [56] The next incident is the August 2, 1996 DIR, initiated by Willie Teigesser, Ms. Laronde's dispatcher. The DIR details that when Ms. Laronde returned to the Gibson yard after a run on that day, she was in a bad temper, yelled and swore at Mr. Teigesser and failed to complete a delivery to Honda.\n[57] Ms. Laronde's version is that she was dispatched to go to JCI in Mississauga. She arrived at the Gibson yard around 5:30 a.m., left the yard shortly after and arrived at JCI around 7 a.m. She had expected to spend the day shunting trailers between the JCI warehouse, although there had been some discussion that she may have to drive to Welland and pick up a container for Honda. It is a five-hour trip from Mississauga to Welland to Alliston and probably longer because it was a long weekend.\n[58] She was dispatched to Welland later that day and protested to everyone at Gibson who could do anything about it. In the end, Ms. Laronde made the run, believing that if she didn't, she could be terminated for refusing a load.\n[59] By the time she picked up the container and brought it back up to the Gibson yard it was about seventeen hours after she started at JCI that morning. The container was to be delivered to Honda about three kilometres away and her post-trip responsibilities included delivering the container, fueling and cleaning the truck and parking it in its designated spot. Ms. Laronde parked the truck with the container still attached at the back of the yard and went into the office where Mr. Teigesser was, threw the paperwork on the desk in front of him and said, Your precious fucking container is down at the end of the yard and left.\n[60] Ms. Laronde wrote a letter to the company the same day explaining her actions and she also appealed to the management committee. The management committee decided at its August 30, 1995, that the incident should be noted as a minor offense and that she apologize to her dispatcher, which she did. The charge of failing to complete an assignment, which would have been a major offense, was dropped.\n9. September 18, 1996 - bad attitude - no disciplinary offense [61] Ms. Laronde was dispatched for a London switch which involved dropping a trailer for the U.S. and picking up a trailer coming from the U.S. When she arrived, the U.S. driver had dropped the trailer and was sleeping. According to Ms. Laronde, the understanding between drivers is that you do not wake a sleeping driver, and so she had no opportunity to speak to the driver. She drove to the Alliston yard, dropped the trailer and left a note at the office asking that dispatch send a message to the other driver telling him where she had left the paperwork for the trailer, and to check the trailer weight. The dispatcher felt that it was the responsibility of the driver, not dispatch, to take care of these matters and wrote up a DIR. Ms. Laronde provided an explanation. Nothing came of this incident.\n10. September 27, 1996 - failure to verify load - major offense [62] This has been described as the culminating event that led to Ms. Laronde's termination. On September 27, 1996, Ms. Laronde was written up for failure to verify load which was noted as a major offense. The DIR indicated that she did not verify whether the trailer was empty or loaded with empty racks.\n[63] Ms. Laronde's version of this incident is that she was dispatched to SPS to pick up a trailer and deliver it to Manchester Plastics. When she arrived at SPS, it was raining, very windy and very muddy. She was not inclined to open the back door of the trailer because of the dangerous weather conditions. Dispatch had directed her to pick up trailer #554, empty or loaded with empty racking. If there was a problem with the trailer number, or if there was no racking, she was to see the shipper at SPS and call dispatch for further instructions.\n[64] Ms. Laronde did not open the trailer to see what was inside. Instead she went inside the SPS office and spoke to the supervisor who told her that the trailer #554 was empty, there was no paperwork indicating there was no load, and that it was to go to Manchester Plastics. So Ms. Laronde drove the trailer to Manchester Plastics.\n[65] When she arrived there and opened the trailer door, the trailer was not empty, but was loaded with empty containers. She reported this to the supervisor at Manchester Plastics who was expecting an empty trailer. After discussing the matter with Gibson, it was decided that Ms. Laronde would bring the trailer back to SPS and another driver would bring an empty trailer to Manchester Plastics.\n[66] Ms. Laronde agreed that, given the dispatch message, she should have checked to see if the trailer was empty or loaded with racks. But she relied on the information from the supervisor at SPS who told her that the trailer was empty and there was no bill of lading. Ms. Laronde did concede that if the supervisor had given her bills of lading that showed there was empty racking in the trailer, she would have checked the load and, given the weather conditions and her safety concerns, she would have asked someone in the SPS office to help her. This incident was rated as a major offense.\nComparator\n[67] The Commission's comparator is the evidence of Steve Holt, who recalled that sometime in 1992-1993, there was an incident involving Billy Cain, who did not check the load before leaving for a Windsor switch. The trailer was to have empty racking only, but when the U.S. switch driver opened the trailer to check the load, the racking was loaded with parts. Mr. Cain was not paid for the trip and he had to pay for the fuel costs of the trip. There is no documented evidence of this incident.\nb) Conclusion on Adverse Differential Treatment [68] Both the Commission and the respondent Gibson took the position that this is not a case of wrongful dismissal. Rather, the issue is whether Gibson discriminated against Ms. Laronde when applying its disciplinary procedures to her. And, if so did the discrimination play a role in the termination of her employment.\n[69] Of the ten incidents put forward by the Commission, three, August 15, 1995, July 25, 1996 and September 18, 1996 did not lead to any disciplinary offense. It remains somewhat of a mystery to me why these were proffered, other than to show that Ms. Laronde had to defend herself to avoid disciplinary consequences. But there was no comparative evidence demonstrating that male drivers at Gibson did not have to do the same.\n[70] The June 12, 1995 incident had fallen off from Ms. Laronde's discipline record and was not a factor in the termination decision. The August 2, 1996 incident was rated a minor and does not appear to have had any role in the decision to terminate Ms. Laronde.\n[71] As to the culminating incident of September 27, 1996, it is not for me to decide whether or not Gibson was justified in disciplining Ms. Laronde, but whether there was discrimination. The comparator was the Billy Cain incident, which occurred sometime in 1992-93. This was based on a rather vague recollection of Mr. Holt with no supporting documentation and which incident occurred well before Gibson's new disciplinary procedures took effect. I attach little weight to it.\n[72] There remains the following incidents, all of which have comparators. These are the May 9, 1996 - Hisan incident; the June 6, 1996 and June 18, 1996 - late delivery; and the June 28, 1996 - final warning.\n[73] Dealing first with the Hisan incident, the comparators are David Cleary, HW, RM and Scott McWilliams. In my opinion, all are valid comparisons in terms of the time frame in which they occurred and the similarity of the incidents. Dealing first with Hisan and Cleary, both were customer complaints, Cleary had no physical contact or verbal confrontation and there was no request that Cleary not return to the customer's plant. There was a request from the customer that he not be disciplined, but be spoken to.\n[74] Cleary received a verbal warning. Ms. Laronde`s final discipline was a note to file and an apology. In my opinion, Ms. Laronde's misconduct was much more serious than that of David Cleary. If her discipline was harsher, a conclusion that I do not necessarily accept, it was justified.\n[75] As to Hisan and RM, both were customer complaints. In the case of RM there was no physical contact, but a concern that Gibson may no longer be used as a carrier. RM was loud and abusive to the customer's security guard. He was given a verbal warning and because this was not the first occurrence, he lost his good guy bonus.\n[76] In my opinion, Ms. Laronde's actions were more serious than that of RM. But she only received a note to file. RM received a verbal warning and suffered a financial loss.\n[77] As to HW, this was a customer complaint regarding unacceptable remarks HW made to a female employee of a Gibson customer. There was no physical contact, no request that he not return to the customer. At the time, HW had five previous incidents (no details given). He received a final warning and was required to give a written apology. On these facts, I do not consider that Ms. Laronde received harsher discipline.\n[78] The case of Ms. Laronde and Scott McWilliams is hard to assess because there is no evidence about his conduct other than he had behavioural issues. He was given a final warning, was suspended for three weeks without pay, was put on probation for six months with no good guy bonus in that period. It would be very difficult to conclude on these facts that Ms. Laronde was more harshly treated than Scott McWilliams.\n[79] In the result, I have concluded that the Hisan incident and the comparators, do not support a conclusion of adverse differential treatment for Ms. Laronde.\n[80] The Commission argued that both Ms. Laronde and Steve Semple received final warnings, but Mr. Semple's actions were much more egregious. There is no common ground between these two fact situations. The events leading to the final warning are totally dissimilar. If they are to be considered similar situations, then to be treated more harshly, Ms. Laronde should have received more than a final warning and more three weeks suspension without pay.\n[81] There remains to be considered the June 6, 1996 and the June 18, 1996 late delivery incidents. The comparator is Mike Rumble. In my view, this comparator is troublesome for Gibson. The facts of the incidents are very similar. They both involve late deliveries; all occurred within June 1996. In the June 6, 1996 incident, Ms. Laronde was late for a switch. There was no late delivery of the load to Honda. Her explanation appeared reasonable, yet she was given a major on the basis that a late is a late. One June 18, 1996, Ms. Laronde was late for her window time. She did not appeal on the understanding that a late is a late.\n[82] On the other hand, Mr. Rumble was late for his window time, because he left late. No explanation was given as to why. Yet this incident was treated only as a note to file. The onus is on Gibson to offer an explanation as to why this was so. The only explanation offered was that of Ms. Lawrence who said that the matter was dealt with and resolved by the dispatcher.\n[83] In my opinion, this explanation does not satisfy the onus. Ms. Laronde was treated more harshly than Mr. Rumble on these two occasions for a late delivery. She was adversely differentiated in the course of her employment. Accordingly, I find that Gibson discriminated against her contrary to s. 7 (b) of the Act.\n[84] Equally as significant is the fact that these two disciplinary offenses were a major factor in her termination. If Ms. Laronde had received the equivalent discipline to that given to Mr. Rumble then, as of June 28, 1996, her discipline record would show only one major offense, the hours of service violation, which would drop off on June 30, 1996, leaving Ms. Laronde with no major offenses. Thus, there would have been no occasion for Gibson to issue a final warning and the culminating major offense of September 27, 1996 would not have been a culminating event leading to her termination.\n(ii)Sexual Harassment - s.14 of the Act [85] When Ms. Laronde received her final warning on July 3, 1996, she wrote a letter to Gibson the same day to say that she was very concerned that she had three major incidents and faced termination. She requested that she be transferred from the U.S. board to one of the other driver boards, Gibson agreed to her request and she was put on the floater board.\n[86] In her evidence, Ms. Laronde said that the reason she wanted off the U.S. board was because she felt that she was regularly being tracked on the satellite system and this had led to her accumulating the recent number of disciplinary offenses that put her on the edge of keeping her job. Because only trucks running on the U.S. board had the satellite system, once off the U.S. board, Ms. Laronde thought that her problems would end.\n[87] The satellite system is a two-way communication between the U.S. dispatch office and the driver. The message that is sent out from the office appears on an LDS screen in the truck and can only be read on that screen. The driver can respond to the message by using the keyboard in the truck. The satellite system is operated by the dispatcher for the U.S. board and is located in a separate dispatch room in the Gibson office.\n[88] The satellite system can be used to track the location of each Gibson truck on the U.S. runs, how far it has gone, how long it has been on that run, whether the truck is parked, whether the ignition is on or off, etc. A paper copy of all the messages sent and received by the satellite can be printed but this is not normally done unless there is a reason to do so.\n[89] Both Ms. Laronde and the Commission agreed that the allegations of sexual harassment relate to the conduct of Steve Holt only and no one else at Gibson. When Ms. Laronde joined Gibson, Mr. Holt was a driver on the U.S. board. In September 1994, Mr. Holt moved from driver to become the night supervisor. As the night supervisor, Mr. Holt was not a dispatcher and had no supervisory or disciplinary control over the drivers. His main responsibility was to prepare the billing and payroll for the accounting staff to work on in the morning. His other function was to deal with problems that drivers may encounter during the night shift or deal with customer inquiries during that period. Mr. Holt could direct a driver if there was a clear need to do so, but that was the extent of his authority.\n[90] The evidence is undisputed that Mr. Holt resigned as night supervisor near the end of September 1995, and went back as a full time driver on the U.S. board. He left Gibson on April 19, 1996, to become a coach driver. There was no contact between Ms. Laronde and Mr. Holt after that date.\na) Alleged Incidents of Sexual Harassment 1. The trip envelope - Did you make coffee for Steve [91] There is a drivers room at the Gibson offices with a large table and chairs. Drivers would use the room to sit and drink coffee, tell stories and generally socialize in a work context. The drivers room also has individual mail slots for each driver located on one of the walls.\n[92] Each driver has a large manila envelope, their trip envelope with their name and employee number which is kept in their mailbox. When they finished a run, they would put their paperwork inside their trip envelope, and put the envelope into a large bin in the room used by all the drivers. The paperwork would go to the accounting office to be processed and the envelope returned to the driver's mailbox.\n[93] Steve Holt had written on Ms. Laronde's envelope Did you sign your bills and Did I make fresh coffee for Steve? She testified that Mr. Holt bragged that he was a man's man and a woman is subservient to him. Every time she handed in her paperwork, there was Mr. Holt's reminder to her of her subservient position. Ms. Laronde did not give any time frame for this.\n[94] Mr. Holt agreed that he had written this, but his explanation was that drivers would come into the drivers room and fill their thermos with coffee. If there was no coffee available, they would complain to him. He said that he made probably 50 to 60 pots a week. His recollection is that probably Ms. Laronde came in, complaining that there was no coffee and that was his response.\n[95] Mr. Holt also testified that everybody had access to the trip envelopes and drivers would often write comments on other driver's envelopes. Some were rude or vulgar, other comments related to a driver not refueling or cleaning their truck. Often drivers' nicknames were written on their envelopes identifying their distinguishing attributes such as Eddy the human tripod, Billy long dong, Old fart, Newfie, etc. The driver's mailboxes were open to everybody and often such things as woman's underwear, jockstraps, cheese, tools would be found there. He also pointed out that a driver could go through an envelope a week, depending on how much paperwork they stuffed in it. If it got torn, they would get a new one, by asking anyone in the office.\n[96] Mr. Holt said that Ms. Laronde never complained to him about what he had written on her envelope and she could easily have replaced it with a new envelope. Ms. Lawrence also said that Ms. Laronde could have asked for a new envelope at any time. Ms. Laronde agreed that she could have done so, but she choose not to, even after Mr. Holt had left Gibson.\n2. The encounter on the fuel tank [97] Ms. Laronde testified that Mr. Holt would often boast in the drivers room about his exploits on the road. He was a storyteller. Ms. Laronde recalled that not long after she started at Gibson, she walked into the drivers room and Mr. Holt was there recounting one of his exploits to some of the other drivers. He was driving for Zavitz Transport. He went to a bar, met a lady in the bar and the two of them went outside and they had sex on the fuel tank of his truck. He told how her husband came out of the bar and he and the husband got into a fight in the parking lot.\n[98] Mr. Holt's version was that he was in a bar, came outside and got tangled up with some woman out there. As he described it, she was on the fuel tank of his truck and they were fooling around. A car pulled up, the passenger door flew open, this little old man sitting in the car told her to get in the car and away they went.\n[99] Mr. Holt could not recall whether he told this story in the drivers room or on the CB radio. Nor could he recall if he told in the drivers room and whether or not Ms. Laronde was there at the time. She never complained to him that this tale was inappropriate or unwelcome.\n[100]Mr. Holt described the drivers room as having the character of a men's locker room. There were a lot of jokes told, hooting and hollering, vulgar language and things like that. Drivers would talk about things they had seen going down the road. According to Mr. Holt it is quite amazing what a driver sees going down the road sitting ten feet up off the highway inside the truck, from things that are comical or funny to outright sexual goings on in the front seats of cars. Drivers would often retell these experiences. In his view, his story was like many stories told in the drivers room.\n[101] Mr. Holt said that truck drivers are storytellers. Ninety percent of what a truck driver tells you is bullshit and the other ten percent is questionable. You never knew what was true or not, so you never put much stake in it.\"\n3. Working the parking lot - satellite message [102] Ms. Laronde testified that she was on a U.S. run and stopped at her usual truck stop to sleep. She received a satellite message from Mr. Holt asking, What are you doing? Working the parking lot?. In her view, Mr. Holt was suggesting that she was trying to make extra money by working the parking lot as a prostitute. Her evidence is that that this occurred in November\/December 1995. Ms. Laronde said that she was very upset by this message. She did not send a return message or speak to Mr. Holt about it. Mr. Holt did not recall sending the message.\n4. The Chris Reid message [103] Chris Reid was an owner\/operator for Gibson and a friend of Ms. Laronde. Ms. Laronde testified that Mr. Reid was returning from a U.S. run and had contacted Mr. Holt to see if there were any drivers in the area that were running home. Drivers like to run together, because it makes the time go faster and keeps them more alert. Mr. Holt sent her a satellite message, Chris Reid is waiting for you in Tilbury with a chub on. Hurry. When she arrived at Tilbury, Mr. Reid was in his truck. She knocked on his truck door, told him that she had received a message to meet him there. She then bought them both coffee at Tim's and they headed back to Alliston in their trucks.\n[104] While they were driving back, Mr. Reid told Ms. Laronde on the CB radio that he had checked the message in her truck while she was buying the coffee. The reason he did that, he told her, was because when he first asked Mr. Holt about a driver in the area, Mr. Holt insinuated that Mr. Reid wanted Ms. Laronde for sex. Mr. Reid told her that he vehemently objected to this suggestion and told Mr. Holt so. Mr. Reid wanted to check the satellite message from Mr. Holt to see exactly what the message said. Ms. Laronde's evidence was that this incident occurred in September 1995.\n[105] Mr. Holt recalled sending this message, but his recollection of the facts was somewhat different. According to Mr. Holt, Mr. Reid was in the U.S. dispatch room and told him that they were running a switch. He asked where Ms. Laronde was and asked Mr. Holt to tell her that he will meet her there with a chub on.\n[106] Mr. Holt's understanding of the situation was that Ms. Laronde and Mr. Reid were good friends and this comment was just a joke. Mr. Reid just wanted to meet up so they could run together.\n5. Bob Watt - sharing her bunk with Chris Reid [107] Bob Watt testified that Ms. Laronde had complained to him that one night she received satellite messages from Mr. Holt that she did not consider appropriate. Mr. Watt went to the U.S. dispatch office and read the satellite message printout. The one that stuck out in his mind is a message about Ms. Laronde sharing a bunk with Chris Reid. Mr. Watt said that the message must have been sent by Steve Holt, because he was the night supervisor. Mr. Watt could not remember whether any names appeared on the message, but he says he knew who the message was sent to because it had the truck number.\n[108] Mr. Watt's recollection was that he saw these messages sometime in January, February or March 1995. In cross-examination, Mr. Watt said that he could not pin down the exact date, but he thought it was sometime in the mid-nineties. More specifically, it was within a year of him being terminated by Gibson. He was actually terminated on May 22, 1996, and agreed that these messages could have been sent somewhere between May 1995 and May 1996.\n6. John Hepburn - stay at home on back with legs open [109] John Hepburn was a friend of Ms. Laronde at Gibson and worked as a driver at Gibson from 1993 to 1999. He testified that Ms. Laronde had spoken to him and was upset sometimes about the satellite meesage Mr. Holt sent to her, and derogatory remarks that he made to her. He also testified that Mr. Holt always spoke to him that Ms. Laronde should stay home lying on her back with her legs open and not be out driving and that Ms. Laronde had a nice ass. When Mr. Holt said this to him, there were other drivers in the drivers room. Mr. Hepburn could not recall whether Ms. Laronde was there when Mr. Holt supposedly made these comments. Nor did he say that he passed on these comments to Ms. Laronde. Ms. Laronde did not give any evidence that she heard these remarks or was told about them. Mr. Hepburn did not give any time frame for these comments. He did not see any of the satellite messages.\n[110] Mr. Holt denied making those comments. His evidence was that this is a comment that Mr. Hepburn was more likely to have made and he might have agreed with it. It is not something that he would have said.\n7. Gary Kitchener - have that bitch fired [111] Gary Kitchener was also a friend of Ms. Laronde at Gibson and worked as a driver from 1994 to November 1995 when he was terminated. Mr. Kitchener testified that, in the summer, 1995, Ms. Laronde told him that Steve Holt had sent her harassing and sexual messages over the satellite. He also recalled an occasion when he was in the drivers room with some other drivers. Mr. Holt came in and was upset with Ms. Laronde and said that I am going to have that bitch fired. I'm tired of her being here. Ms. Laronde was not in the drivers room at the time.\n[112] Mr. Kitchener felt that Mr. Holt should not have said that, especially in front of the other drivers. He wrote down the time and date and when he saw Ms. Laronde about a month later, he told her about this. He did this because he was concerned about Ms. Laronde's safety and her job. At the hearing, Mr. Kitchener could not remember the exact date, but believed it to be in July\/August 1995.\n[113] Mr. Holt denied making this comment. As night supervisor, he did not have any authority to discipline a driver and certainly lacked the ability to fire any employee of Gibson.\n8. Satellite tracking [114] Ms. Laronde testified that she felt that Mr. Holt spent a lot of his time tracking her every night on the satellite. She gave three examples of this, one in early 1996 when she was driving back from the U.S. in a very bad storm, and she received a satellite message from Mr. Holt: Do you realize it has taken you nine hours to go 235 miles? She testified that this was very upsetting for her because she had made great efforts to deliver the load safely and felt that Holt had belittled her professionalism in getting to where she was and still being on the road in the face of severe and icy road conditions. When asked about this, Mr. Holt said it was probable that he sent this message, but not in 1996, maybe a year earlier.\n[115] Ms. Laronde also referred to satellite printouts which showed that Mr. Holt had been tracking her on June 15, 1995, the night she took the truck home and which led to her losing half of her good guy bonus.\n[116] On another occasion, Ms. Laronde was on the final leg of U.S. run from Vincennes and had planned to stop for four hours sleep in Orangeville. She received a satellite message from Mr. Holt telling her to bring the truck back to the Alliston yard. Ms. Laronde was scheduled to be back in the yard much later, between 6:30 a.m. and 7 a.m. and with the four hours sleep, she would have made it well in time. She replied that she was beyond her logbook hours, but Mr. Holt sent another message that he wanted the truck back right away. Ms. Laronde parked the truck at Orangeville between two other trucks and slept for four hours.\n[117] Mr. Holt well remembered this incident. Gibson needed Ms. Laronde's truck and he had given her various options. In the end, he arranged for a switch driver to pick up her truck and allowed Ms. Laronde sleep time so she did not go over hours. He also arranged for her to drive a day cab to the Gibson yard in the morning and for someone else to pick up her gear, which did not fit in the day cab.\n[118] As to Ms. Laronde's allegations, Mr. Holt's evidence was that he would only track a driver on the satellite if there was a need to do so. He tracked the truck not the driver when he was the night supervisor, and he did not follow Ms. Laronde on the satellite system any more than any other U.S. driver. It was his experience that any driver who drives a satellite truck feels that they are being tracked.\n[119] Ms. Laronde testified that she felt intimidated by Mr. Holt. She said that she avoided Mr. Holt at all costs. If she returned from a run at night, she would not go into the drivers room to complete her paperwork. Instead, she would complete it in the truck and would just go into the drivers room to hand in the truck key and paperwork. She would then leave as quickly as possible.\n[120] In her evidence, Ms. Laronde said that she complained to a number of people at Gibson about what she considered to be Mr. Holt's harassing conduct. In addition to her friends at Gibson, such as Gary Kitchener, John Hepburn and Chris Reid, she also spoke to persons who she thought had supervisory authority and who could stop Mr. Holt's behaviour. At the time, there were no company policies or procedures that she knew of that she could refer to or rely on.\n[121] The first person she said she spoke to around January 1996 was Mike Morton. He was Mr. Holt's supervisor. Mr. Morton told her that he didn't think there was much chance of anything being done about it, because of the close relationship between Mr. Holt and the Gibsons.\n[122] Ms. Laronde then talked to Willie Teigesser, her dispatcher. She asked him if he had seen the satellite messages that were being sent to her and he said that he had. There is no evidence as to what messages he had seen. This was about a week after she had spoken to Mike Morton. She asked that Mr. Holt be told to stop sending her satellite messages that were not work related. Mr. Teigesser's response was the same as that of Mr. Morton.\n[123] Ms. Laronde went to Bob Watt, the safety director at Gibson, she said, in early 1996. She told him that she was getting satellite messages from Mr. Holt that were uncalled for and were scaring her. She did not know what to do and was looking for some direction. Mr. Watt did not feel that he could do anything because he did not supervise Mr. Holt. He told her that Stacey Beckstead, who worked in the office, had had some problems with Mr. Holt as well, and suggested that Ms. Laronde speak to her. Ms. Laronde did discuss this with Stacey Beckstead who was not very forthcoming, but told her to raise it with her father, Rick Beckstead, Gibson's vice president of operations.\n[124] Ms. Laronde testified that she met with Mr. Beckstead in his office in March 1996. She explained to him that she felt that Mr. Holt was harassing her over the satellite, and give him the example of the 235 miles\/nine hours message. She told Mr. Beckstead that she wanted to do the best job she could, but Mr. Holt's interference was getting to be too much. Mr. Beckstead did not say anything or acknowledge anything at this meeting. Ms. Laronde testified that, after this meeting, Mr. Holt's behaviour changed. He would not speak to her directly and there was a lot of animosity.\n[125] Ms. Laronde also spoke to Ms. Lawrence about Mr. Holt after Ms. Lawrence started at Gibson. Her evidence was that this took place in April or May 1996. Ms. Lawrence confirmed that Ms. Laronde had raised this question with her, not in 1996, but in August, 1995, shortly after she became Human Resources Manager. Ms. Laronde told her that Mr. Holt was sending her offensive messages on the satellite and making crude comments about her in the drivers room. Ms. Lawrence said that she would speak to Mr. Holt which she did. She told him about Ms. Laronde's concerns and he denied that anything like that had happened. They discussed the question of harassment, how it was not condoned by the company and that if it was happening, it must stop, Ms. Lawrence also told Mr. Holt that in the event there were incidents of any kind with Ms. Laronde, he was not to deal with her directly, but refer them to Ms. Lawrence.\n[126] Ms. Lawrence reported back a short time later and told Ms. Laronde that she has spoken to Mr. Holt, that he had denied doing these things and that he agreed to have contact with Ms. Laronde only if necessary for operational requirements. According to Ms. Lawrence, Ms. Laronde seemed to accept this and that was the end of it. She never heard another thing from either party regarding harassment. To the best of her knowledge, there was no further contact between Ms. Laronde and Mr. Holt.\nb) The Law - Sexual Harassment [127] Section 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act makes it a discriminatory practice to harass as individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Under s.14(2) sexual harassment is deemed to be harassment on a prohibited guard. The Act does not define what constitutes sexual harassment, but there are a number of judicial decisions that deal with this. The leading decision is that of the Supreme Court of Canada in Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252. In this case, the Supreme Court defined of sexual harassment as being unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of the harassment. (p.1284) The Court went on to describe sexual harassment as demeaning practice, one that constitutes a profound affront to the dignity of the employees forced to endure it. (p.1284)\n[128] Later court decisions have particularized the types of conduct that are considered to be sexual harassment. In this regard, the Federal Court in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canadian Armed Forces and Kimberley Franke, [1999] 3 F.C. 653 (FCTD), referred to Professor Aggarwal's book, Sexual Harassment in the Workplace, 2d.ed. (1992), in which Professor Aggarwal suggests that sexual harassment may be grouped into three categories, verbal, physical and psychological. Verbal would include unwelcome remarks, jokes that might cause embarrassment; gender based insults, telephone calls or other types of conversations or messages with sexual overtones. Physical implies just that, grabbing, mugging, patting, brushing against etc. Psychological can involve persistent intimate proposals, propositioning, promising favors for sex.\n[129] The Court in Franke also spoke of other factors that may be considered. Once it is found that the conduct is sexual in nature and unwelcome, unless it is a single, serious incident there must be an element of persistence or repetition for the conduct to be sexual harassment. The more serious the conduct and its consequences, the less repetition is necessary. The less serious the conduct and its consequences, the more persistence must be shown.\nc) Analysis and Conclusion [130] It is against this legal backdrop that I now consider the incidents that the Commission and the complainant have alleged to constitute sexual harassment.\n[131] There are issues of credibility both for some of the incidents of alleged harassment and with respect to the dates of Ms. Laronde's efforts to have management deal with her complaints about Mr. Holt.\n[132] Dealing first with the incidents, they are three in number. The first is the working the parking lot satellite message, that Ms. Laronde claims Mr. Holt sent her in November\/December 1995. Mr. Holt was not the night supervisor at that time. When this fact was put to Ms. Laronde, she speculated that Mr. Holt, a driver at that time, could have gone at night to the U.S. dispatch office, on his time off and sent her that message. Ms. Laronde was not willing to revise her estimate of the date that she received the message (unlike what she did for other incidents for which she initially gave that had the wrong time frame).\n[133] Given these facts, there are three possible conclusions. Ms. Laronde did not receive the message. She did receive it, but it was not sent by Mr. Holt. She did receive it, but had the wrong date, which she was not willing to concede. In my opinion, her speculation as to how it came to be that Mr. Holt sent the satellite message is just not credible. The burden is on the Commission and the complainant to establish that this message was sent by Mr. Holt. In my opinion, the evidence does not show this and I can not take this incident into account in determining the question of sexual harassment.\n[134] As to the John Hepburn, stay at home on her bed with her legs open, there is a conflict in the evidence. Mr. Holt denied making these comments. Mr. Hepburn did not give any time frame for the alleged comments. He could not recall whether or not Ms. Laronde was present when these comments were made. Nor could he recall whether he passed these comments on to Ms. Laronde while she was employed at Gibson. He was a friend of Ms. Laronde at Gibson and as such has an interest in supporting her position.\n[135] On the other hand, Mr. Holt, in his evidence was willing to admit that he had sent certain satellite messages to Ms. Laronde; that he had told the encounter on the fuel tank story. He also agreed that he had sent the 235 miles\/nine hours satellite message and even provided a date which made it believable, as opposed to the date that Ms. Laronde had given on the question of credibility, I prefer Mr. Holt's evidence over Mr. Hepburn.\n[136] Finally, there is Mr. Watt's evidence that he read a printout of a satellite message sent at night by Mr. Holt about Ms. Laronde sharing the bunk with Chris Reid. Initially, Mr. Watt's recollection was that he saw this message sometime between January-March 1995. When cross-examined, he changed his evidence to say that he saw it sometime in the mid 90's, possibly between May 1995 and May 1996. Obviously this time frame is problematic because Mr. Holt was not the night supervisor after September 1995. Further, Ms. Laronde who would have received this satellite message and who had a very good recollection of satellite messages that she had received from Mr. Holt, made no mention of this in her evidence. Finally, there is no context for this message or what would have prompted Mr. Holt to send this message, either in January-March 1995 or in May 1995 and May 1996.\n[137] In my opinion, the appropriate conclusion is that there were not two Chris Reid satellite messages. Rather, Mr. Watt, in his recollection, has confused this satellite message with the Chris Reid satellite message referred to in Ms. Laronde's evidence. This evidence is not credible and should not be taken into account on the question of sexual harassment.\n[138] As to the Vincennes satellite message, Ms. Laronde said she received it in February 1996. She later changed this date to February 1995. However, she maintained that she received the 235 miles\/nine hours satellite message in early 1996.\n[139] Ms. Laronde was also very confused about the time frame when she spoke to management. Initially, her evidence was that she had spoken to all the persons mentioned, from Mike Morton, in early January 1996, through to Ms. Lawrence in April\/May 1996. But when she was cross-examined, she tied these conversations to the date that she filed her complaint with the Commission, namely, in August 1996. Her revised evidence was that she had met with Mr. Beckstead in July\/August 1996; Mr. Teisegger in March 1996 and Mr. Morton, a couple of weeks later.\n[140] It is difficult to resolve the conflicts in this evidence. If these conversations had taken place in 1996, Mr. Holt was long gone from the position of night supervisor. He left Gibson in April 1996. If I accept Ms. Lawrence's evidence that the harassments stopped in August 1995, how can one explain the Chris Reid satellite message which was sent in September 1995.\n[141] In spite of the conflicts, I think that the evidence does support the conclusion that Ms. Laronde did speak to the management persons referred to above. Gibson did not seriously challenge this. I have concluded that these discussions did take place sometime either in 1995 or 1996 or both.\n[142] There remains four incidents to consider on the issue of sexual harassment. The first is Mr. Holt writing on Ms. Laronde's trip envelope, Did I make fresh coffee for Steve? Ms. Laronde considered it to be a constant reminder of her subservient position. No doubt, this can be interpreted as belittling, as suggestive of a woman's place. It could be characterized as having gender implications, rather than being sexual in nature. But, for the purposes of this analysis, I will assume it to be conduct having sexual connotations.\n[143] The meet Chris Neil, he is waiting with a chub on satellite message clearly has sexual implications. Mr. Holt agreed that he sent it, but on the urging of Mr. Reid, a good friend of Ms. Laronde. Ms. Laronde's account is otherwise. I need not choose between the two versions. Mr. Holt was in control of the satellite messaging system and it was his decision to send the message. If Gibson wanted to show that this message was not unwelcome, that it was just a joke between friends, Gibson could have called Mr. Reid as a witness.\n[144] Thirdly, there is the encounter on the fuel tank. Ms. Laronde testified that she was in the drivers room when Mr. Holt told it. She was offended by the story. Mr. Holt's description of the drivers room, could lead one to conclude that it had somewhat of a ribald atmosphere. This is not to say that Ms. Laronde was a willing participant , but the evidence is that, from time to time, she was not immune from such goings on.\n[145] I refer to two events in evidence, the 1995 Gibson Christmas after-party and Bob Gauley's birthday celebrations at Crossroads. After the Christmas party, a number of drivers, including Ms. Laronde, had taken rooms at the Red Pines Inn in Alliston. They assembled in Ms. Laronde's room and at one point in the festivities convinced a very inebriated Bob Gauley to put on Ms. Laronde's party dress (which she had changed out of) which he did, complete with corsage and tinsel. Pictures were taken and shown around the Alliston yard by Ms. Laronde and others, much to the consternation of Mr. Gauley, but to the amusement (Mr. Gauley was quite a large man) of the other drivers.\n[146] On another occasion, a number of drivers, of which Ms. Laronde was one, celebrated Bob Gauley's birthday by taking him out for dinner and after to Crossroads, a strip club in Barrie. Ms. Laronde said that much of the entertainment was getting lap dances for Mr. Gauley. She agreed that this involved a near naked woman sitting on Mr. Gauley's lap. Ms. Laronde contributed to the pool of money to pay for the lap dancers.\n[147] In referring to these instances, I am not suggesting that Ms. Laronde accepted or condoned conduct of a sexual nature in her workplace. Rather, from this evidence, it seems that Ms. Laronde was comfortable with a certain level of conduct which had sexual connotations.\n[148] As Mr. Holt said, truck drivers are story tellers. He was telling a story, boasting about one of his sexual exploits. This does have a sexual connotation. But the story was not directed to Ms. Laronde, nor was she the object of the story.\n[149] Gary Kitchener's account of Mr. Holt's saying about Ms. Laronde, that he was going to have the bitch fired, is offensive and demeaning to women. This was not said to her directly, but was reported to her by Mr. Kitchener about a month later.\n[150] Ms. Laronde also complained about Mr. Holt tracking her on the satellite. Ms. Laronde identified three occasions, the June 1995 taking the truck home; the run back from Vincennes; and, the 235\/nine hours satellite message. I do not see any sexual connotations or sexual nexus in any of these three events. Mr. Holt's evidence was that he tracked the truck, not the driver. He would only track the driver on the satellite if there was a need to do so. A good example of this is the Vincennes satellite messages. Mr. Holt sent these messages because Gibson required Ms. Laronde's truck back well before the scheduled time.\n[151] There is no evidence as to why Mr. Holt sent her the message about the amount of time it took her to go 235 miles, or why Ms. Laronde was tracked when she took her truck home. On the other hand, there is no evidence that Ms. Laronde was tracked on the satellite any more than any other Gibson driver. In my opinion, none of these three incidents can be characterized as sexual in nature.\n[152] After this analysis, there remains four incidents that may be considered as being sexual in nature. These are, the trip envelope; the encounter on the fuel tank; the Chris Reid incident; and, having the bitch fired. As noted earlier, unless the conduct is very serious, a single incident or isolated incidents of offensive sexual remarks generally do not create a hostile or detrimental work environment. In my opinion, none of these remarks considered individually are so severe as to have this effect. Nor, taken collectively, do these remarks present a persistent pattern of offensive conduct. The evidence is that they were spread over at least 18 months from March 1994 to September 1995.\n[153] For these reasons, I have concluded that the Commission and the complainant have failed to establish a contravention of s.14 of the Act.\niii) Failure to be Promoted to Owner\/Operator [154] The final element of Ms. Laronde's complaint is that she was not selected to be an owner\/operator. Owner\/Operators are another category of drivers at Gibson. They are licensed AZ drivers who own their own tractor truck, pay for their fuel costs, licence plate, insurance, a portion of the WSIB premiums and part of their benefits package.\n[155] Gibson's practice is to contract with owner\/operators for one year, which is automatically reviewed unless notice is given two weeks prior to expiry. But either party can terminate at any time on two weeks notice. Under the contract, the owner\/operator agrees to provide services exclusively to Gibson. The owner\/operator is the primary driver of the unit, with exceptions made for vacations or illness, or some other unforeseen situation. In such cases, relief drivers could driver the unit. Owner\/operators drive only on the U.S. board.\n[156] Around January 1996, Ms. Laronde had told Ms. Lawrence that she was interested in becoming an owner\/operator. She was told to put her name on the list to make sure that management knew of her interest and then wait.\n[157] According to Ms. Laronde, Rick Beckstead called her on March 28, 1996, and asked her if she was still interested in becoming an owner\/operator. He told her that Gibson would be hiring out of the driver pool and she was being considered. Ms. Laronde understood that if she could meet the criteria, she would be selected. She had spoken to a truck dealer, earlier in January 1996, in anticipation of becoming an owner\/operator.\n[158] However, on March 29th, the very next day, Mr. Beckstead told her that he didn't need her to go and buy a truck now. She learned that Gibson has selected four drivers, Scott Armstrong, Chad Horan, Ken Johnson and Warren Snell to become owner\/operator.\n[159] She also testified that in August 1996, Gibson selected three more drivers to be owner\/operators. Norrie Sarcen was one of them but she could not recall the others. Ms. Laronde was not even considered. She was not, said Ms. Lawrence, because her overall performance was not up to company standards. Also, she was not on the U.S. board. Owner\/Operators only run to the U.S.\n[160] There was always a certain number of drivers at Gibson who wanted to own their vehicle. Prior to 1996, there was nothing to which drivers could refer to tell them how go about becoming an owner\/operator with the company. In 1996, after discussions with the owners, Ms. Lawrence prepared a document called Broker Requirements. This set out certain criteria that must be met before a driver would be considered, including, presently running to the U.S.; good attitude; ability to finance a new truck of certain dimensions and color; and full time with Gibson for a minimum of two years.\n[161] The Broker Requirements were viewed by the owners as a starting point and they reserved the right to make the final decision. as to who and when they would select an owner\/operator.\n[162] Ms. Lawrence's practice was to compile a list of drivers who were interested in becoming an owner\/operator when an opportunity came up, she would give the list to the drivers who would make the selection. In the case of the drivers selected in March and August 1996, Bing Gibson made the decision.\n[163] Ms. Lawrence agreed that the Brokers Requirements did not specify that a driver's incident record is to be considered. But she did say that an owner\/operator has to be operationally sound. They have to be reliable, know the company's policies and procedures and follow them. A driver who does not have a good record would not be accepted as an owner\/operator because they had not proved themselves as a company driver.\n[164] Bing Gibson gave evidence as to how he made the decisions. For him a driver gets to be an owner if they have a good personality. They have to be on time every time. They must be able to finance the truck and handle the payments. They should be mechanically inclined and be able to repair their trucks. This is an important factor for operating costs which impacts on whether or not an owner\/operator will be successful.\n[165] As to the four owner\/operators, Chad Horan has been with Gibson since November 10, 1994. Bing Gibson knew his grandfather and his father and he knew Chad personally. He is the nephew of Leonard Gibson, one of the Gibson owners. According to Bing Gibson, he grew up around Gibson and was an automatic choice.\n[166] Warren Snell was originally hired by Gibson in September 1988. Bing Gibson said that he was brought on as an owner\/operator because he liked the area that Mr. Snell came from, Mona. Mr. Snell is also a heavy equipment operator and understands heavy equipment. He has not caused the company any problems. He had the backing of his father and his house was paid for. He was on time every time which is very important to Gibson.\n[167] Scott Armstrong started as a driver with Gibson on April 29, 1994. Bing Gibson knew and had done business with his father. He had known Scott Armstrong's family for 15 years before he came to work for Gibson. They were farmers, good people and there was no reason why, said Bing Gibson, he would not choose him as an owner\/operator.\n[168] Ken Johnson started at Gibson in 1992. Bing Gibson's comments about Mr. Johnson were that he often saw him cleaning and polishing his truck when he was at home. He spent a lot of time making sure it was immaculate. Bing Gibson was impressed with that. Mr. Johnson was always on time. He had financial backing.\na) Analysis and Conclusion [169] The Commission argued that, having regard to the Broker Requirements, Ms. Laronde was as qualified as any of the four chosen to be owner\/operator, the only distinguishing factor being that she is female and the others are male.\n[170] The Commission argued that the logical inference is that Ms. Laronde did not get to be an owner\/operator was because of her gender. In support of this argument, the Commission referred to two cases, Basi v. CNR (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, and Stakes v. Rex Pak Limited, (1982) 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001.\n[171] The principle derived from these cases is that, if the complainant had the qualifications for the position and somebody else, no better qualified, but lacking the distinguishing characteristics of the complainant, was hired, there is an obligation on the employer to provide a credible explanation as to why the complainant was not hired.\n[172] The facts are that none of Ms. Laronde, Mr. Horan, Mr. Armstrong or Mr. Johnson met all of the Broker Requirements. As of March 1996, Ms. Laronde, Mr. Horan and Mr. Armstrong had not been full time employees for two years. According to Ms. Laronde, Mr. Horan and Mr. Johnson were not running to the U.S. at that time. The qualifications of Mr. Snell were not challenged.\n[173] Assuming that the Broker Requirements were more than just guidelines, the question is whether or not Gibson exercised its discretion in a discriminatory manner in choosing these three individuals and not Ms. Laronde when none of them met all of the criteria in the Broker Requirements.\n[174] Bing Gibson's evidence was that Chad Horan was a nephew of the owner. He was family. He grew up around Gibson. He was an automatic choice. Bing Gibson knew Scott Armstrong's family. He had business with his father and grandfather. They were good people. Ken Johnson took exceptional care of his truck and that impressed Bing Gibson. He was always on time. He had financial backing.\n[175] These explanations may not be the basis upon which others would decide. But for Bing Gibson, from a business point of view, these considerations were important. In my opinion, there is nothing in this evidence that can be construed as a pretext for not selecting Ms. Laronde because of her sex. Thus, I have concluded that Gibson did not discriminate against Ms. Laronde and did not contravene s.14 of the Act.\nIII. REMEDY A. WAGE LOSS [176] When there is a finding of discrimination, it is incumbent on the Tribunal in providing a remedy to make whole the victim of the discriminatory practice, taking into account principles of foreseeability, remoteness and mitigation. Canada v. Morgan, [1989] 2 F.C. 401 (C.A.) and Canada v. McAlpine, [1989] 3 F.C. 530 (C.A.)\n[177] The Commission's position on wage loss is if Gibson had not discriminated against Ms. Laronde, there would have been no final warning and no basis for terminating her employment on October 2, 1996. The Commission urged that she be compensated for lost wages and the compensation period should be 29 months, the period that Ms. Laronde worked at Gibson.\n[178] The respondent Gibson, relying on the principles of reasonable notice derived from wrongful dismissal jurisprudence, suggested that two and one half months would be appropriate.\n[179] In Morgan, the Court of Appeal pointed out that principles of wrongful dismissal should not be imported into human rights cases when determining compensation. This is because the liability of the employer for wrongful dismissal arises out of the failure to give proper notice, not because of discriminatory treatment. The source of the liability is different and so should the consequences.\n[180] As to the submission of the Commission, it fails to take into account relevant intervening facts. The evidence is that Ms. Laronde successfully completed her probationary year and presumably was incident free. As Gibson's counsel pointed out, this was also true for the period from June 1995 to May 1996. But from May 1996 to September 1996, that there was a noticeable spike in the number of disciplinary offenses. Ms. Laronde was building a disciplinary record that was putting her job in jeopardy.\n[181] As of October 2, 1996, Ms. Laronde had three majors, two hours of service violations and a failure to inspect the load. According to the company's Rules she was open to termination. But the evidence is that Gibson did not apply the Rules strictly, especially for termination. Another factor to consider is that the two hours of service violations would have fallen off Ms. Laronde's disciplinary record in a few weeks. The evidence also suggests that over hours violations were not considered as serious as other operational violations.\n[182] Taking all these factors into account, it is my opinion that the appropriate period for calculating the wage loss is nine months. Ms. Laronde should be fully compensated for nine months from the date of her dismissal. From this should be deducted the income she earned from alternate sources.\n[183] Ms. Laronde will be entitled to a lump sum payment on account of lost wages. This may well result in negative income tax consequences for her. It would unfairly penalize her if she were to suffer a more onerous income tax burden by receiving a lump sum payment now, than she would have incurred had the monies been paid to her as salary on an on-going basis between October 1996 and the date of payment. Accordingly, Gibson shall pay Ms. Laronde an additional amount sufficient to cover any additional income tax liability that she may incur as a consequence of receiving payment in this fashion.\nB. SPECIAL COMPENSATION [184] Section 53 (3) of the Act, as it stood in October 1996, provided for awards of special compensation for reckless or willful conduct, or for injuries to feelings or self-respect, to a maximum of $5,000. There are no assertions that Gibson's conduct was reckless or willful.\n[185] The evidence is that being terminated by Gibson put Ms. Laronde in a very difficult position. She had no job, was a single parent with three children to support. Her mother, who was unable to live on her own, also lived with and was supported by Ms. Laronde. The stress, that she suffered because of job loss, was compounded by the financial pressures she now faced.\n[186] Ms. Laronde testified that she immediately began looking for work as a driver. She was not able to find full time work that paid her similar wage rates to Gibson. The full time work that she did obtain was not for the long term.\n[187] In all of the circumstances, I award Ms. Laronde $5,000 for special compensation.\nC. INTEREST [188] Interest shall be payable on the monies awarded for lost wages in accordance with Rule 9 (12) of the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure. Interest should run from October 2, 1996 to the date of payment, and be calculated as the wages would have become payable to Ms. Laronde.\nD. OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES [189] Ms. Laronde should be reimbursed for the out of pocket expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice including expenses incurred for the hearing of her complaint.\n[190] If the parties are unable to agree within 30 days of the date of this decision as to the quantification or implementation of any of the remedies awarded hereunder, I retain jurisdiction to deal with these matters.\nJ.

The Commission's Position\nC. The Complainant's Position\nIV. ANALYSIS\nV. CONCLUSION AND ORDER\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] The issue raised by this motion is whether the Canadian Human Rights Commission, in appearing before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, can deliver an opening statement consisting primarily of a general overview of the applicable law, and then withdraw from the hearing, but reserve its right to participate at some later time.\n[2] The Commission's proposed method of proceeding in this case is a fundamental change in the way the Commission has traditionally represented the public interest before the Tribunal. The Canadian Armed Forces has objected to the Commission's manner of proceeding, arguing that this would be fundamentally unfair to its right to defend itself as the respondent in these proceedings.\nII. FACTUAL HISTORY [3] Donna Mowat filed a complaint of discrimination against the CAF, wherein she alleges that she has been the victim of sexual harassment during her employment with the CAF. Following an investigation into Ms. Mowat's complaint, the Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal for hearing.\n[4] In the course of a pre-hearing teleconference convened by the Tribunal, counsel for the Commission advised the other parties that it did not intend to participate in the hearing, beyond appearing at the commencement of the hearing to deliver an opening statement. A subsequent exchange of correspondence clarified that it was the intention of the Commission to provide an opening statement:\n... detailing the public interest in the complaint. The submission will set out the Commission's view of the legal issues in the case and will provide a detailed statement of the law relevant to [the] complaint. Commission counsel will not be present for the full duration of the hearing....\n[5] Following receipt of this clarification, the CAF brought a motion before the Tribunal, asking the Tribunal to find that the proposed manner of participation by the Commission is improper and prejudicial to the CAF. In particular, the CAF objects to the Commission delivering an opening statement without having to support its submissions with facts proven before the Tribunal. The CAF also objects to the fact that the Commission did not provide the parties with the details of its position in advance of the hearing, as required by the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. The CAF asks for an order that the Commission not be permitted to participate in the hearing in the manner that it proposes and for an order requiring the Commission to disclose the substance of its position in advance of the hearing.\n[6] In the course of a second teleconference, Tribunal Vice-Chairperson Grant Sinclair directed that the Commission provide the parties with a copy of its proposed opening statement, so that the propriety of the Commission's proposed submission could be addressed in the course of the motion. A copy of the Commission's proposed opening statement is appended to this ruling.\nIII. Threshold ISSUE [7] Before addressing the substance of the CAF's motion, a threshold issue arises, namely, whether the Tribunal has the power to deal with the way in which the Commission intends to participate in this hearing.\n[8] The Commission submits that the Tribunal has no authority to review decisions of the Commission made pursuant to the Canadian Human Rights Act, as supervisory jurisdiction over the Commission is confined to the Federal Court. According to the Commission, its status as an independent party appearing before the Tribunal means that it has the unfettered right to appear at a hearing. Section 50 of the Act grants the Commission party status, making it clear, the Commission says, that the Commission does not have to apply to the Tribunal ... to have the scope of its participation considered by the Tribunal. The Commission submits that if the Tribunal were to attempt to review the way in which the Commission chose to represent the public interest in this case, it would be inconsistent with the Commission's status as an independent party.\n[9] Although the Commission's written submissions were framed in absolute terms at the hearing of the motions, Commission counsel did concede that the Tribunal, as master of its own procedure, has the power to control the hearing process and to take action where the conduct of one party would result in unfairness to another party. By way of example, Commission counsel conceded that it would be open to the Tribunal to direct that the Commission deliver its summary of the law at the end of the hearing, rather than at its commencement.\n[10] The CAF agrees that a decision by the Commission to participate in a given case is properly reviewable in the Federal Court, and not before the Tribunal. However, the CAF argues that when the Commission appears before the Tribunal, the Commission must comply with the principles of fairness and with the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure.\n[11] As the Tribunal has previously noted, it is up to the Commission to decide how best to carry out the public interest mandate required of it under section 51 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.1 It is not up to this Tribunal to second-guess the Commission in this regard. Rather, decisions made by the Commission in individual cases are properly reviewable in the Federal Court.2\n[12] That said, it does not mean that the Commission can conduct itself without constraint in its appearances before the Tribunal, without regard for the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, the requirements of procedural fairness and the rights of the other parties to a proceeding. Like any other party, the Commission is subject to the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, and is, as well, subject to any evidentiary or procedural rulings that the Tribunal may make.\n[13] As an adjudicative body dealing with the quasi-constitutional rights enshrined in the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Tribunal has not only the power, but the duty, to ensure the fairness of the process. The Tribunal has the power to preclude the Commission, for example, from asking leading questions while examining its own witnesses, calling inadmissible or irrelevant evidence, or making closing submissions that refer to facts not in evidence. So too does the Tribunal have the power to ensure that any representations that the Commission makes in a given case, whether by way of opening statement or otherwise, respect principles of fairness.\n[14] In our view, the Commission's position mischaracterizes what the CAF is seeking. The CAF's objection does not involve a review of a decision of the Commission. Rather, it involves the determination of whether the procedure that the Commission intends to adopt in participating in this hearing conforms with the principles of fairness as well as the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. As such, we are satisfied that the Tribunal has the power to deal with the CAF's objection to the Commission's proposal to deliver its proposed opening statement.\nA. The CAF's Position As To The Commission's Proposed Participation [15] The CAF argues that what the Commission is proposing to do is contrary to the purpose of an opening statement. An opening statement is designed to provide the trier of fact with a general understanding of what the facts and issues will be in the case. In referring to specific facts in an opening statement, counsel is subject to an implied undertaking, that is, a professional obligation to ensure that any facts that counsel refers to in his or her opening statement will be supported by the evidence.\n[16] Although the Commission contends that it will restrict its comments in its opening statement to ... the Commission's view of the legal issues in the case and will provide a detailed statement of the law relevant to [the] complaint..., the CAF says that a review of the proposed opening statement provided by the Commission illustrates how difficult it is to make legal submissions without grounding those submissions in the facts of the case. In particular, the CAF points to the Commission's proposed submission that:\nThere is no doubt that sexual harassment is not only a particular concern to women but a matter of public concern. It pervades the workplace, government, schools, law firms, medical profession, military, sports, and cultural institutions.\nThis demonstrates that the Commission intends to suggest to the Tribunal that there is a systemic problem of sexual harassment in the Canadian military. Given that the Commission does not intend to call any evidence in this case, it is clear that it will not be in a position to establish what it alleges. In the CAF's submission, the making of such an unsupported allegation would amount to professional misconduct on the part of Commission counsel. Further, such a statement would be highly prejudicial to the CAF. Such an allegation could well influence the Tribunal member hearing the case when it considers the merits of Ms. Mowat's individual allegations of sexual harassment. This is more so coming from the Commission, a party with known expertise in the field.\n[17] By allowing the Commission to refer to jurisprudence on a particular topic, the hearing could be prolonged, as it may become necessary for the CAF to call evidence to show why the law does not apply, even though the facts of the case do not otherwise raise the issue. For example, the Commission intends to refer to the law governing what should be included in a sexual harassment policy. The natural inference for the Tribunal to draw from this, the CAF says, is that the CAF's harassment policy may be inadequate. Prudence might then require the CAF to call the necessary evidence to establish affirmatively that its policy was sufficient, even though the actual facts of Ms. Mowat's case might not otherwise call into question the adequacy of the CAF's policy.\n[18] Further, in order to decide what law is relevant to a specific case, the Commission has to presuppose a certain understanding of the facts of the case. By way of example, in its proposed opening statement, the Commission refers to the law relevant to the issue of retaliation. There is nothing in Ms. Mowat's complaint that even suggests that retaliation is in issue in this case. The only reference to allegations of retaliation are contained in Ms. Mowat's Statement of Issues. Thus, the CAF says, in making any reference to the question of retaliation, the Commission has to assume the facts as alleged by Ms. Mowat.\n[19] The Commission contends that its opening statement is a neutral overview of the law, intended to assist both the parties and the Tribunal. The CAF disputes this, pointing out, for example, that the Commission did not refer to the existing Tribunal jurisprudence which decided that the retaliation provisions of the legislation do not have a retroactive effect. Thus they would not apply to the events in this case which occurred prior to June of 1998.3 In this way, the Commission's opening statement unfairly favours the complainant, to the detriment of the CAF.\n[20] In addition, the CAF says that the Commission has not complied with the disclosure obligations imposed on the parties by the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. The Commission did not provide the parties with advance notice of its position as to how the public interest is engaged in this case. Had it not been for the Tribunal's direction that the Commission file a copy of its proposed opening statement prior to the return of this motion, the CAF says that it would have had no idea of what the Commission's position was until the first day of the hearing. This, the CAF says, is fundamentally unfair.\n[21] The CAF also argues that it will be prejudiced if the Commission is permitted to reappear at some point in the hearing. It has no way of knowing when, or if, this will occur, or the nature of the Commission's participation. As a result, the CAF can not anticipate what questions it may need to ask of the complainant's witnesses, and what evidence it may need to call in order to address the position that the Commission may adopt later in the hearing.\n[22] Finally, the CAF argues that a generic statement of the law, which is not tied in to the facts of the case will be of limited assistance to the Tribunal. And the limited utility of this type of opening statement is outweighed by the prejudice to the CAF that will accrue if the opening statement is permitted.\nB. The Commission's Position [23] The Commission denies that the CAF will be prejudiced in any fashion, if the Commission is permitted to deliver its proposed opening statement. According to the Commission, both the complainant and the respondent were advised early in the process that the Commission intended to limit its participation in this case. Further, the Commission says, its representations will be confined to a statement of the law governing the complaint. Given that the Tribunal is an expert Tribunal, the Commission says it will not be unduly influenced by Commission submissions regarding the law, should those submissions be made at the commencement of a hearing.\n[24] The Commission disputes the CAF's assertion that the Commission has failed to identify a public interest in this case. According to the Commission, the public interest in a complaint crystallizes when it is referred to the Tribunal on the basis that the Commission is satisfied that the complaint merits further inquiry. The Commission takes the position that the public interest lies in ensuring that the appropriate legal issues are adjudicated, and that legal principles are fully developed. This does not require that the Commission lead evidence in a given case.\n[25] Counsel for the Commission submits that the Commission's role when appearing before the Tribunal, is more akin to that of a Crown Attorney. The Commission is not adverse in interest to any of the other parties. Rather, the interest of the Commission is to see that justice is done. Commission counsel did concede however, that its review of the law is meant to be neutral, the Commission is not infallible.\n[26] Further, the Commission says that, its review of the law is designed to assist not just the Tribunal, but the parties, in understanding the law relevant to the case in issue. While recognizing that a generic overview of human rights principles will be of limited assistance to an expert Tribunal well acquainted with human rights law, the Commission is interested in ensuring that parties appearing before the Tribunal are familiar with the relevant jurisprudence.\n[27] The Commission agrees that it is improper for a party to refer to facts in an opening statement where those facts will not be proven by the party. According to the Commission, its proposed opening statement deals only with uncontested facts, and thus does not engage the implied undertaking principle. While conceding that the reference to a systemic problem of sexual harassment in the Canadian military is a contested fact, the statement is innocuous in the Commission's view and not prejudicial to the CAF. In any event, the Commission says, the implied undertaking is nothing more than a rule of practice and not of law.\n[28] The Commission pointed out that, as an administrative tribunal, the Tribunal is not bound to follow the same rules and procedures applied by the courts. Rather, the Tribunal should be flexible and innovative in the way that it conducts hearings.4 This flexibility and innovativeness should extend to receiving what the Commission refers to as a non-traditional opening statement.\n[29] In the Commission's submission, the CAF has failed to demonstrate how it will be prejudiced if the Commission delivers its proposed opening statement, and then withdraws from the hearing. Its assertions of prejudice are entirely speculative, the Commission says, and as such, cannot be addressed by the Tribunal. According to the Commission: The CAF has asked the Tribunal to engage in a speculative exercise that is not only improper, but which has forced the parties to expend considerable resources in response thereto. In any event, the Commission says, the CAF will have the full and ample opportunity during the hearing itself to respond to any submissions made by the Commission in its opening statement.\n[30] Finally, with respect to reserving its right to come back into the hearing, the Commission accepted that it would be subject to the direction of its Tribunal and any objections from the other parties. The Tribunal could address any prejudice that might accrue to the CAF at that point in the hearing.\nC. The Complainant's Position [31] Counsel for the complainant says that it would be helpful for the complainant to know what the Commission's view is of the public interest issues in her case. Counsel views the Commission as being on the side of his client, he can always use allies, and the Commission's participation, albeit limited in scope, would help to even the odds.\n[32] The Commission's overview of the law is helpful, counsel says, and assisted him in fully appreciating the issues raised by his client's case. While he would like to see the information contained in the opening statement presented to the Tribunal, counsel is sensitive to the prejudice that the CAF could suffer if the Commission is permitted to deliver its opening statement.\n[33] It does not matter to Ms. Mowat's counsel whether the Commission provides the information through an opening statement or in closing submissions. He does say, however, that it would have been helpful if he had received this information from the Commission much earlier in the process.\nIV. ANALYSIS [34] The law governing the proper content of opening statement before the courts is clear. In Brochu v. Pond5, the Ontario Court of Appeal recently adopted to following statement from Halsbury's Laws of England, as quoted in Sopinka's, The Trial of an Action6 :\nThe object of an opening statement is to give the court a general notion of what will be given in evidence ... In his opening, counsel states what he submits are the issues and the questions between the parties which have to be determined, what are the facts of the case, the substance of the evidence he has to adduce and its effect on proving his case, and he will refer to the relevant correspondence between the parties and other documents. He will remark upon any point of law involved in the case, but the opening is not the occasion for detailed argument on legal questions, or an extensive examination of the authorities. In opening, counsel may refer to those facts of which the court takes judicial notice. Neither in opening or at any stage of the trial may counsel assert his personal opinion on the facts or the law, or mention facts which require proof but which it is not intended to prove, or which are irrelevant to the issue to be tried.\nSimilarly, in Modern Trial Advocacy, Canadian Ed.7, it is noted that:\nThe courts and commentators are virtually unanimous that opening statements may only be used to inform the court of what the evidence will show. Counsel may not argue during opening, but is restricted to offering a preview on the anticipated testimony, exhibits, other evidence, and an outline of the issues.\n[35] It is true that much of the case law dealing with the proper bounds of opening statements has arisen in the context of jury trials. The relevant principles are nevertheless of general application. While counsel may have greater latitude when it comes to the identification of the legal issues in non-jury trials 8, the same prohibition against making reference to facts not intended to be proven holds true.9 So too does the prohibition against the making of legal argument in an opening statement.10\n[36] The rules regarding the proper content of opening statements have evolved over the generations and are designed to ensure the fairness of the trial process. The opening statement that the Commission proposes to deliver at the commencement of the hearing in this case demonstrates the unfairness that can result when counsel are permitted to stray from the accepted bounds of an opening statement.\n[37] Contrary to the submissions of the Commission, the proposed opening statement does deal with contested facts. The allegation that there is a widespread problem with sexual harassment in the Canadian military can hardly be said to be innocuous. The claim that sexual harassment permeates the CAF invites the inference that Ms. Mowat's individual claim of sexual harassment is well founded. Such an unsupported assertion on the part of the Commission clearly operates to the detriment of the CAF.\n[38] We agree with the CAF that the Commission's overview of the law is not entirely neutral. Despite the Commission's assertion that its review of the case law is non-partisan, and does not favor one side over the other, the example cited by the CAF with respect to the issue of retaliation demonstrates the difficulty in providing a truly non-partisan summary of the law.\n[39] The delivery of a summary of the law also has the potential to complicate the hearing. When legal submissions are made at the close of a hearing, both the parties and the Tribunal have a clear understanding of the facts, and the ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant legal issues. If a party makes submissions on an irrelevant legal issue, an opposing party may object and the Tribunal is in a position to deal with the objection. If the authorities are reviewed in detail before the evidence comes in, the Tribunal has no way of knowing what is relevant, and what is not. The Commission cannot assist in explaining the relevance of its submissions, should there be an objection, because it cannot refer to the facts of the case.\n[40] We accept the submissions of the CAF that it will be prejudiced if the Commission is permitted to provide its overview of what it says is the relevant case law at the commencement of the hearing. Not only does the determination of what law is relevant to the case presuppose the existence of certain facts, it also has the potential to prolong the hearing. While a hearing should take as long as necessary to allow each side the full opportunity to be heard, a party should not, in our view, be permitted to put issues `on the table' that require a response from another party, and then leave the hearing, without having established that the issue is, in fact, germane to the case.\n[41] It is noteworthy that the Commission has not provided the Tribunal with a satisfactory explanation as to why it should be permitted to deviate from the general practice, and deliver a summary of the law at the beginning of the hearing, rather than at the end as would ordinarily be the case. The Commission suggested that this would assist the parties to a particular complaint by providing them with an overview of what the Commission thinks is the applicable law. There is nothing however to prevent the Commission from delivering such a summary to the parties at any time in the process.\n[42] The Commission has also neglected its obligations under the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. These Rules are designed to ensure that arguments and evidence are disclosed in a timely and efficient manner, so that each of the parties is made aware, in advance of the hearing, of the case that they have to meet. To this end, Rule 6 imposes certain disclosure obligations on parties appearing before the Tribunal. Under the Tribunal Rules, the Commission and the CAF are obliged to provide written notice of the material facts that it seeks to prove in support of its case, as well as the legal issues raised by the case. Similar obligations are imposed on complainants, where the complainant's position varies from that of the Commission. Provision is also made for reciprocal documentary disclosure, as well as the provision of witness lists and `will-say' statements.\n[43] Nothing in these Rules obliges the Commission to participate in a given case. Similarly, nothing compels the Commission to call evidence, to cross-examine opposing witnesses, or to make legal arguments. These are questions for the Commission to decide, in accordance with the public interest mandate conferred on it by section 51 of the Act. However, if the Commission is going to participate in a hearing, the other parties are entitled to know, well in advance of the hearing, the position that the Commission will be taking at the hearing. In particular, the parties are entitled to know what the Commission views as the public interest in a particular case, so as to enable the party to lead the necessary evidence and make the necessary arguments to address that interest, as the party may see fit.\n[44] It is not sufficient for the Commission to say that there is a public interest in every case referred to the Tribunal by the Commission, and nothing more. In this case, but for the intervention of the Tribunal, Ms. Mowat and the CAF would have had no indication from the Commission until the first day of hearing, as to what the Commission's view of the public interest in the case would be. This is contrary to the Tribunal's Rules, and does not benefit the process.\nV. CONCLUSION AND ORDER [45] For the foregoing reasons, we have concluded that the Commission's proposed manner of participation in this hearing does not comply with the principles of fairness or the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. Accordingly, the Commission will not be permitted to deliver an opening statement in the form and manner that it has proposed. The Tribunal member assigned to hear this case on the merits will deal with any issues arise out of the decision.\nsigned by\nJ.

In this particular case, the Tribunal will be asked to consider human rights law in the following areas: (a) An employer's obligation to provide a harassment free work environment and the liability associated with an employer who fails to do so; (b) Adverse differential treatment by an employer and the refusal to continue to employ an individual because of the employee sex.\nRELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS\nSection 7 of the Act makes it a discriminatory practice either refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual and\/or to directly or indirectly differentiate adversely in the course of employment on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nSub-section 14(1)(c) of the Act makes it a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination in matters related to employment. Sub-section 14(2) provides that sexual harassment shall be deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Thus, the statutory framework recognizes sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination.\nSection 14.1 of the Act makes it a discriminatory practice for an employer against whom a complaint has been filed to retaliate or threaten to retaliate against the individual who filed the complaint.\nSubsection 65 (1) of the Act provides liability to an employer for the discriminatory acts of its employees that occur in the course of employment. Section 65(2) exculpates an employer provided that it did not consent to the commission of the act or omission and that it exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed, and subsequently mitigated or avoided the effects of the act or omission.\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT GENERALLY There is no doubt that sexual harassment is not only a particular concern to women but a matter of public concern. It pervades the workplace, government, schools, law firms, medical profession, military, sports, and cultural institutions. Harassment, including sexual harassment can create a negative or hostile work environment which can interfere with an employee job performance and result in an employee being refused a job, a promotion, training opportunity, or may even result in the employee leaving employment. When sexual harassment occurs in the workplace, it is an attack on the dignity and self-respect of the victim both as an employee and as a human being.\nIn Janzen v. Platy Enterprises [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 Supreme Court of Canada acknowledged that women have a right to a workplace that is free from discriminatory attitudes and behavior, and furthermore, women have the ability to seek broad remedies available under human rights statutes when this right is violated. Janzen, supra, concerned complaints made by two female waitresses who had been sexually harassed by a cook at the defendant's restaurant. The nature of the incidents included inappropriate touching and sexual remarks. The allegations included a threat of terminating employment when the sexual advances were resisted. Ms. Janzen quit her job after a co-owner refused to do anything when confronted with the allegations. The Supreme Court of Canada up-held the decision of the original adjudicator who found that the two women had been subjected to persistent and abusive sexual harassment and had been victims of sex discrimination contrary to the human rights legislation in Manitoba. The adjudicator awarded exemplary damages and damages for loss of wages and found the cook and the employer joint and severally liable for the discrimination.\nThe Supreme Court recognized that sexual harassment may take a variety of forms, including physical and\/or psychological dimensions. Sexual harassment manifests itself in milder forms such as verbal innuendo and inappropriate affectionate gestures to extreme behaviour amounting to attempted rape and rape. Actions such as pinching, grabbing, hugging, patting, leering, brushing against and touching can each be forms of physical seexual harassment. Proposals of physical intimacy, including subtle hints which may lead to the requests for dates and sexual favours, would demonstrate psychological sexual harassment. [see: Janzen v. Platy Enterprises [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at para 49.]\nChief Justice Dickson, writing for the Court, provided a non-exhaustive definition of sexual harassment:\nWithout seeking to provide an exhaustive definition of the term, I am of the view that sexual harassment in the workplace may be broadly defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of harassment. Janzen v. Platy Enterprises [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at para 56.\nIn Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces) and Franke, [1999] F.C.J. No. 757 (T.D.)(QL), [hereafter Franke Madame Justice Tremblay-Lamer applied and elaborated theJanzen, supra, test in assessing sexual harassment. In Franke, the complainant alleged that the employer, Canadian Armed Forces, had discriminated against her contrary to section 7 and 14 of the Act. The complainant alleged that the pattern of conduct of her superior officers created a hostile work environment and that her a non-commissioned senior in rank to her inquired about her dating habits and made suggestive gestures towards her and showed her a postcard depicting a bare-breasted women. The complainant also alleged that the commanding officer referred to her in derogatory terms.\nIn a 2-1 Tribunal decision, the majority held that the complainant has not been subjected to sexual harassment and had not suffered differential treatment based on her sex. The Federal Court upheld the majority decision of the Tribunal and found that the Tribunal applied the correct test for sexual harassment and its findings were not patently unreasonable. There was evidence that the complainant did not view the conduct in question as harassment at the time it occurred. In her decision, Justice Tremblay-Lamer elaborated on the Janzen test to be applied for sexual harassment. Two recent decisions of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Bushey v. Sharma dated June 5, 2003 and Woiden et al. v. Lynn dated June 17, 2002) succinctly summarize Justice\nTremblay-Lamer elaboration of the test. InWoiden et al., the Tribunal summary is as follows:\nThe acts that are the subject of the complaint must have been unwelcome. The Tribunal must therefore look at a complainant's reaction at the time of the incident and assess whether she expressly, or by her behaviour, demonstrated that the conduct was unwelcome. The Court recognized that a verbal o is not required in all cases and that a repetitive failure to respond to suggestive comments constitutes a signal to a harasser that his conduct was unwelcome. Fear of losing her job, for instance, may force an employee to endure objectionable conduct. The appropriate standard against which to assess a complainant's conduct will be that of a reasonable person. The conduct must be sexual in nature. This encompasses a broad range of conduct. Requests for sexual favours and propositioning fall within the ambit of acts that are sexual in nature and that constitute a psychological form of sexual harassment. Verbal sexual harassment includes gender-based insults, sexist remarks, comments about a person looks, dress, appearance or sexual habits. Physical forms of sexual harassment include pinching, grabbing, hugging, kissing and leering. Persistent questioning about an employee personal sex life has been held to constitute sexual harassment. The Tribunal determination of what is sexual in nature should again be assessed to the standard of a reasonable person in the circumstances of the case, keeping in mind the prevailing social norms. Ordinarily, harassment requires an element of persistence or repetition, but in certain circumstances even a single incident may be severe enough to create a hostile environment. The objective reasonable person standard is used to assess this factor as well. The final factor arises where a complaint is filed against an employer regarding the conduct of one of its employees. Fairness requires that in such cases, the victim of the harassment, whenever possible, notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct. This factor is no longer relevant to the present case, in light of the settlement that the Complainants reached with the employer before the matter was referred to the Tribunal. [at para 103]\nWith respect to the reasonable person standard, the Federal Court of Appeal held that in cases of sexual harassment where the alleged victim is a woman, the reasonable standard should be adapted to that of a reasonable woman. (Stadynyk v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Comm.) (2000), 38 C.H.R.R. 01290 at para 25 (F.C.A.)) Justice Tremblay-Lamer decision inFranke, supra, suggests that, in determining how a reasonable person would react in similar circumstances, a Tribunal should e sensitive to stereotyped norms of what constitutes acceptable conduct and consider the context in which the impugned conduct took place.[Franke, F.C.T.O., supra, at para 41.]\nIn Swan v. Canada (Armed Forces), (1994) 25 C.H.R.R. 0\/312 (Can. Trib.) at para. 73, a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal confirmed that t is not necessary for harassment to be the sole reason for the actions complained of for a complainant to succeed. The harassment need not even be intentional by the perpetrator of the harassment. This case concerned a native Canadian who alleged that he was subjected to racial slurs, jokes and harassment while with the Canadian Armed Forces.\nThe Tribunal clearly states that the Canadian Human Rights Act does not take into consideration the conduct of the Complainant and even though the Complainants may participate in or instigate objectionable conduct they may still file a complaint and succeed in their claim. (Swan v. Canadian Armed Forces, decision of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal dated October 18, 1994 at p. 8) This is in keeping with the remedial purpose of the Act. The Tribunal in Swan accepted that individual may feel powerless to do anything but accept the behavior because of their desire to fit into the peer group. In substantiating the complaint, the Tribunal ordered that a written apology be provided to the complaint but it held that it did not have the power to award lost wages. However, the Tribunal stated that if they had the power to award lost wages, they would have awarded the complainant for any remaining time left on his employment contract to a maximum of four years provided that at least four years remained on his employment contract at the time of his release. The complainant had requested four years. The Tribunal also noted that if the complainant had no remaining time on his employment contract, it would make no award as to lost wages. In determining this issue, the Tribunal appropriately considered whether or not the harassment that the complainant experienced was a factor in his decision to leave his employment. Furthermore, the Tribunal observed that the harassment need not be the sole factor in a decision to leave. [Swan, Tribunal decision at p. 15.]\nThe Commission and the complainant filed an application for judicial review only on the issue of the refusal to award lost wages. The Federal Court Trial Division allowed the application. Therefore, a victim of the harassment described in section 14 of the Act can be compensated for any or all lost wages incurred as a result of the discriminatory practices.\nThe Act and the jurisprudence make it clear that an employer is liable for all discriminatory acts committed by its employees in the course of employment. Section 65(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act exculpates employers if they did not consent to the commission of the harassment and exercised all due diligence to prevent the harassment from being committed and, subsequently, to mitigate or avoided its effects.\nIn Robichaud v. R, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that the xistence of a policy against sexual harassment and a mechanism to handle employee complaints could provide an employer with a good defence which could partially reduce liability. The Court stated:\n[A]n employer who responds quickly and effectively to a complaint by instituting a scheme to remedy and prevent recurrence will not be liable to the same extent, it at all, as an employer who fails to adopt such steps. These matters, however, go to remedial consequences, not liability [at p. 12]\nIn referring to the Robichaud decision, Aggarwal and Gupta note that the Supreme Court is informing employers that it is their actions, and not their words, that are they key factors in assigning liability to sexual harassment cases. [Aggarwal, 2000 at p. 264.]\nAccording to Black's Law Dictionary, ue diligence is defined as:\nSuch a measure of prudence, activity, or assiduity, as is properly to be exercised from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent man [person] under the particular circumstances; not measured by any absolute standard, but depending on the relative facts of the special case.\nIn exercising all due diligence in preventing the harassment from being committed and mitigating or avoiding its effect, an employer's responsibility include: a) Make it clear that harassment of any nature, including sexual harassment, will not be tolerated; b) Establish a harassment policy which sends a clear and unequivocal message to all employees that sexual harassment is unacceptable and contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act; c) Make sure every employee understands the policy and procedures for preventing harassment as well as procedures for handling sexual harassment complaints; d) Inform supervisors and managers of their responsibility to provide a harassment- free work environment; and e) investigate and correct harassment complaints promptly and effectively, even if a, formal complaint has not been received. A failure to take appropriate remedial steps immediately would make an employer liable for sexual harassment to the fullest extent.\nIn terms of the mechanisms for reporting and investigating complaints, a sound harassment policy is one that affords multiple points at various levels of the organization for an individual to file a complaint. Multiple filing points allow an employee the ability to choose the one that is most comfortable to the particular individual based on the individual's circumstances. A sound harassment policy will ensure that all complaints are taken seriously and dealt with fairly and promptly. Furthermore, a sound harassment policy reinforces the principle that individuals found responsible of sexual harassment will be disciplined. Aggarwal suggest the following analysis in determining the seriousness of the penalty imposed by an employer against a person who is found responsible for sexual harassment:\nDisciplinary measures may range from verbal reprimands and warnings for less serious offences, to suspensions without payor discharges for more serious offences. If the employer decides that a transfer will be necessary, it should be the harasser who is transferred and not the victim. However, before deciding upon the appropriate disciplinary action, factors such as the nature of the behaviour, the persistence of the behaviour, and whether or not the harasser displays co-operation and willingness to change, should be taken into consideration. [ Aggarwal, Arjun and Madhu Gupta, Sexual Harassment in the Workplace, 3rd Ed. (Markhan, Ontario: Butterworths Canada Ltd.: 2000 at p. 457)\nIn Gervais v. Canada (Agriculture Canada), [1988] C.H.R.D. No.8 (Can. Hum. Rights Rev. Trib.) (QL), the Canadian Human Rights Review Tribunal applied Robichaud, supra, and found the employer, Agriculture Canada, liable for sexual harassment as a result of the actions committed by one of its employees. In this case, the complainant alleged that her work environment undermined the dignity of women. There was evidence in the hearing that magazines were being kept in desk drawers and posters displayed in the work environment which was found to be crude and in bad taste. Despite the Review Tribunal's concern with the complainant's allegation concerning a poisoned work environment, it was satisfied that sexual harassment took place contrary to section 7 of the Act and, based on Robichaud, held that the employer, Agriculture Canada liable for the conduct of its employee. In considering the conduct of the employer in examining the potential for mitigation of employer damages, the Tribunal made the following important observations:\na) Despite a thorough and exhaustive investigation of this incident, by union representatives, police authorities and investigators under the direction of J.J. Carties, the ultimate decision was to take no action at all. [...] b) The grievance of the Appellant [complainant] required a long and laborious review process during a period of time when she was undergoing severe physical and emotional stress and receiving medical treatment for the same. The request for transfer was the ultimate in ineffective bureaucracy. We agree with the Tribunal below that it is difficult to believe that the Department was taking every reasonable step to facilitate the transfer. [Gervais, supra]\nThe Review Tribunal concluded that Agriculture Canada's actions following the actions constituting the sexual harassment were neffective and indecisive and held that the employer was liable to the complainant for loss of wages and hurt feelings.\nThe jurisprudence makes it clear that for an employer to avoid liability the employer is obligated to respond promptly and effectively and it must conduct a meaningful and thorough investigation of matters complained of, as well as treating the complainant with sensitivity. (see Swan, supra at 14; Hinds v. Canada (C.E.I.C.) (1988),24 C.E.I.C. 65; and Pitawanakwat v. Department of Secretary of State (1992),19 C.H.R.R. C\/10 (appealed on other grounds)).\nIn conclusion, it is important to note that the Canadian Human Rights Act does not contain any provisions to provide costs to a respondent, if it is successful in its defence. As per section 53(1), if the Tribunal finds that a complaint is not substantiated, the complaint is dismissed. If, however, the Tribunal substantiates the complaint, Section 53(2) provides the ability of the Tribunal to award various remedies including reinstatement, an award for lost wages, expenses incurred, hurt feelings and special compensation. The recent jurisprudence of the Tribunal has awarded legal expenses incurred by a complainant in pursuing a successful complaint.\n",

HILL\nComplainant\n- and -\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION\nCommission\n- and -\nAIR CANADA\nRespondent\nRULING ON TAKING A VIEW\n2003 CHRT 4\n2003\/02\/05\nMEMBER: Paul Groarke\n[1] In the course of the hearing into the complaints before me, I expressed an interest in seeing the shop where Mr. Hill worked and was given a tour of the workplace where most of the relevant events took place. I was accompanied by the Complainant and counsel for all the parties. Since there was some discussion as to the effect of the view during the course of the hearing, it seems best to clarify the matter.\n[2] The law on taking a view is unclear. In Sopinka's Law of Evidence in Canada, the authors state that there is an issue as to whether a view is evidence which can form the basis of inferences by the trier of fact or is simply clarification of the witness' testimony.(1) The Tribunal has not dealt explicitly with the issue. In Bye v. International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, Local 502, C.H.R.T. T391\/0794, a Tribunal nevertheless took a view of a union hall in order to see job boards before hearing testimony in the case. It appeared to treat this as an original source of evidence, which could be consulted in following the rest of the evidence in the case.\n[3] The decisions of the Tribunal run counter to the idea that a view is something less than evidence. This is evident in Forseille v. United Grain Growers Ltd. [1985] C.H.R.T. 7, where the Tribunal relied on what it observed during the view as evidence but did not discuss the legal issue. There were also views in Gauthier v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. 6014 and Martin v. Canada (National Defence) (1992) 17 C.H.R.R. 435 (C.H.R.T.), which present similar situations. There is a way, at least, in which a view is direct evidence in the fullest sense of the word, since it is not filtered through the senses of a witness. As a result, it is often more compelling than testimony, which is always second-hand.\n[4] The leading case in the Federal Court appears to be Jaworski v. The Attorney General of Canada [1998], 4 F.C. 154 (T.D.), where a disciplinary Board took a viewing of the area where the Applicant had allegedly exposed himself.(2) The Applicant denied the allegation and had another explanation for his presence in the area. On his account, he had been sitting on his back porch and he saw a man looking at his car. After yelling at the man, he followed him into the alleyway, where he was approached by the investigating officers. Although the Board gave the Applicant the opportunity to add to the record with respect to the view, it did not express any misgivings with respect to the observations that it had made during the view.\n[5] The Adjudication Board later held that the Applicant would not have been able to see the stranger well enough to provide the description that he gave in testimony. This was one of the factors that it considered in rejecting the Applicant's testimony. The decision of the Board eventually made its way through an External Review Committee to the Commissioner of the R.C.M.P., who dismissed the Applicant's appeal. The matter was then taken to the Federal Court, where two questions were raised with respect to the view. The first was whether a trier of fact can rely on a view, in rejecting the evidence of the witnesses in the case. This would essentially treat a view as evidence, which is probative in its own right. The second question was whether the Board had an obligation to divulge its misgivings to the parties.\n[6] On the first question, Justice Rothstein surveyed two competing positions. The first derives from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in London General Omnibus Company v. Lavell, [1901] 1 Ch. 135, where Lord Alverstone states, at page 139:\nA view, as I have always understood, is for the purpose of enabling the tribunal to understand the questions that are being raised, to follow the evidence, and to apply the evidence.\nThe Ontario courts have apparently followed this line of authority and held that a view may be taken for the purpose of understanding the evidence but does not itself constitute evidence.\n[7] I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that the second position treats the distinction in London Omnibus as a cavil: evidence is evidence, and in most cases at least, it is artificial and even disingenuous to pretend that it does not have probative effect. As a result, a judge is entitled to rely on the observations made during a view in rejecting the factual assertions of the witnesses. This position derives from Meyers v. Government of Manitoba & Dobrowski (1960), 26 D.L.R. (2d) 550 (Man. C.A.) and Calgary & Edmonton Railway Co. v. MacKinnon (1910) 43 S.C.R. 379. It can also be found in the English law.\n[8] The concerns in the case law come from the need to separate the roles in a hearing. It is difficult for a trier of fact to consider its own observations in marshlling the evidence without entering the domain reserved for the parties. The decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Technologie Labtronix c. Technologie micro contr\u00f4le, REJB 1998-07742, among others, holds that a judge should not use a view for an investigative purpose. It is not the role of a trier of fact to gather evidence. There is also a concern that a trier of fact may have adopted the role of a witness in such a situation, whose silent testimony cannot be countered by the parties. This raises an issue of natural justice.\n[9] There is a third position. In Jaworski, Justice Rothstein appears to accept the fundamental principle that the purpose of taking a view is to better understand the evidence in the case. He nevertheless rejects the idea that the view has no independent evidentiary weight:\n\u2026 it would be going too far to state that where a tribunal conducts a view, not for the purpose of gathering its own evidence but to better understand the evidence being submitted, that the tribunal can never rely upon its own observations made at that viewing. It would be highly artificial to require that the tribunal ignore its observations and decide the issue based on evidence that it considers to be untrue.\nIt follows that a view is evidence, albeit evidence of an explanatory nature, which can be considered along with the other evidence in the case. It would seem to follow that the significant issue is whether the parties have had an opportunity to respond to any issues that it may have been raised such an idea.\n[10] The second question in Jaworski was whether the Board had an obligation to share its concerns with the parties, Justice Rothstein rejected this idea and held that the Applicant had a full opportunity to respond to the view. I think this opinion can be restricted, however, to the facts of the case. There may be other cases where the situation is different. As a matter of fairness, there may well come a point where a Tribunal has some obligation to share its concerns with the parties. It all depends on the circumstances of the case. I do not see how a tribunal can respect the rules of natural justice and essentially hide decisive issues from the parties.\n[11] The decision in Jawoski at least establishes that a tribunal has no obligation to raise factual issues that are in the open and properly before the parties. The critical factor at the end of the hearing is whether the parties have had a full and ample opportunity, in the words of the Act, to address the material issues in the case. If the parties choose not to canvass issues that are openly before the Tribunal, that is their prerogative and they cannot complain that they were taken by surprise. I believe this was the real finding in Jaworski, which seems to give a tribunal some authority to take notice of what it observes during a view.\n[12] The view in the present case was taken relatively early in the hearing, for the purpose of helping me understand the rest of the evidence in the case. All of the parties agreed to the process and there was ample opportunity to offer evidence controverting what was seen. If there is any difficulty, it is that we saw the premises years after the material events occurred. As a result, I have exercised a certain degree of caution in relying on what I observed during the tour of the shop. I do not believe, however, that it raised any issues that were not already before the parties.\n[13] I have accordingly concluded that my observations during the view can be consulted, along with the rest of the evidence, in deciding the main issue in the case. I do not believe that the matter requires further comment.\nOriginal signed by\nPaul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nFebruary 5, 2003\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE NO.: T677\/6501\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Yul F.

INTRODUCTION [1] In December 2001, Melanie-Lynn McKay filed a human rights complaint against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police alleging that the RCMP refused to employ her because of her previous drug dependency, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Ronald Howell filed a complaint against the Canadian Armed Forces in July 1998, in which he alleged that the CAF discriminated against him under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by requiring that he participate in drill without a knee brace.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission has referred both cases to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for hearing. Hearings have been scheduled for February 2004, in the case of the Howell complaint, and for April 2004, in the McKay matter. Both respondents are represented by the Department of Justice in Winnipeg. In each case, the Commission initially advised the other parties that it would limit its participation in the hearing to the delivery of an opening statement. The respondents then filed motions, objecting to the Commission\u2019s proposed method of participation in these cases.\n[3] The Commission later advised the parties that it would participate fully in each case. However, the respondents still seek an order from the Tribunal on the motions. Their position is simple. Having abandoned its intention to participate on a limited basis in these cases, the Commission has tacitly admitted that its original approach was improper. The respondents accordingly feel that they are entitled to an order to this effect.\n[4] The Commission objects to the respondents\u2019 request, stating that the issues raised in the respondents\u2019 motions are moot since the Commission will be fully participating in the hearing. Further, the Commission says the Tribunal does not have the authority to deal with the motions. Because the issues in the two cases are identical, the motions were heard together.\nII. FACTUAL HISTORY [5] The McKay and Howell complaints were referred to the Tribunal for hearing on May 15, 2003. Approximately two weeks later, Ian Fine, the Acting General Counsel of the Commission advised the parties in each case that:\nCommission counsel will be present at the hearing to provide an opening submission detailing the public interest in the complaint. The submission will set out the Commission\u2019s view of the legal and factual issues in the case and will provide a detailed statement of the law relevant to your complaint. Commission counsel will not be present for the full duration of the hearing.\n[6] These letters were followed by an exchange of correspondence between the parties, as counsel for the respondents sought clarification of the contents of the opening submissions.\n[7] Counsel for the respondents objected to the Commission\u2019s proposed manner of procedure. The respondents took the position that the Commission should participate fully in the hearing in each case, as the respondents say it is statutorily obligated to do, or absent itself from the entire proceeding. They contend that it would be prejudicial to allow the Commission to make an opening statement in those cases in which it does not intend to call evidence.\n[8] On September 26, 2003, Ceilidh Snider of the Commission wrote to the parties in each case. In the McKay case, she wrote:\nPlease be advised that the Commission will be fully participating in the hearing of the above matter. Would the Tribunal please contact the Commission and the parties to set disclosure and hearing dates.\n[9] Ms. Snider\u2019s letter in the Howell matter was even more terse. The letter reads, in its entirety:\nPlease be advised that the Commission will be fully participating in the hearing of the above matter.\n[10] The Commission gave no reason for the reversal in its initial stance regarding its participation in either the McKay or Howell cases.\n[11] The situation remains the same. The Commission has not identified any change in its view of the issues raised by the two cases that would explain the change in its position. However, counsel for the Commission candidly acknowledged during argument that the reason that the Commission changed its position was to avoid litigating the challenges brought by the respondents.\nIII. THRESHOLD ISSUE [12] The Commission argues that it has an unfettered right to appear at a hearing. It says that the Respondent is now asking the Tribunal to review the manner in which it has chosen to represent the public interest. This, it says, is beyond the authority of the Tribunal and is only reviewable by the Federal Court.\n[13] We accept that the decision of the Commission whether or not to participate in a given case is properly reviewable in the Federal Court and not by this Tribunal. It is up to the Commission to decide how best to carry out the public interest mandate conferred upon it by section 51 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. That said, it does not mean that the Commission can operate without constraint in appearing before the Tribunal, without regard for the requirements of procedural fairness, the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure and the rights of the other parties to a proceeding.\n[14] The Tribunal has the power to control the hearing process, and to take action where the conduct of a party would result in unfairness to another party. As an adjudicative body dealing with quasi-constitutional rights, the Tribunal has the authority and the duty to ensure the fairness of the process. For example, the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to preclude the Commission from calling evidence that is irrelevant, or from making closing submissions that refer to facts not in evidence. So too does the Tribunal have the power to ensure that any opening submissions by the Commission are in keeping with the basic principles of fairness.\nIV. ANALYSIS [13] The Commission submits that the issues raised by the respondents in Howell and McKay are now moot, since the Commission has now agreed to participate fully in the hearing. As a result, the Commission says, the Tribunal should decline to deal with the respondents\u2019 requests.\n[14] The respondents submit that the doctrine of mootness has no application to matters of practice, which are entirely within the discretion of the Tribunal. Even if the Tribunal were to conclude that the motions are moot, the respondents say that the Tribunal should decide the motions. For the respondents, the motions raise important issues with respect to the practice before the Tribunal. All of the parties that come before the Tribunal would benefit from the guidance of the Tribunal in the area.\n[15] The Respondent\u2019s counsel goes further, however, and suggests that the Commission\u2019s actions in these cases are evasive. The Commission should not be allowed to side-step the issue that the respondents have raised without some formal recognition that it is obligated to participate fully in the cases. The Tribunal should not condone the Commission\u2019s tactics in these cases and should decide the motions.\n[16] The Commission acknowledged that the public interest issues raised by the Howell and McKay cases did not change between its initial decision and the point at which it reversed this decision. As previously noted, Commission counsel candidly admitted that the Commission changed its position in order to avoid having to litigate the respondents\u2019 challenges to the Commission\u2019s new approach to participation in Tribunal hearings. In our view, this raises serious concerns as to the way in which the Commission exercises it public interest mandate. It creates the impression that the Commission\u2019s actions were dictated by expediency, rather than the substantive issues raised by the Howell and McKay complaints.\n[17] The respondents have expressed concern as to the resources that they were forced to expend as a result of having had to bring motions that ultimately proved unnecessary. This is a legitimate concern. In the civil litigation context, the courts would compensate a moving party for its costs thrown away, when an opposing party \u2018backs down\u2019 in the face of a pending motion. In our view, such an award of costs in favor of the respondents would have been appropriate here. There is nothing, however, that the Tribunal can do to provide the respondent with such a remedy.\n[18] We have considered the jurisprudence cited by the parties with respect to the question of mootness and the policy considerations that militate in favor of an adjudicative body deciding on an issue that may have otherwise become moot. Having considered the principles set out in these cases, we have concluded that there is no need for the Tribunal to exercise its discretion and decide the respondents\u2019 motions.\n[19] There is no doubt that the motions raise an issue of fundamental importance to the practice before the Tribunal, namely the fairness or appropriateness of the new approach taken by the Commission in many of the cases coming before the Tribunal. However, in the same week that this panel heard the motions in Howell and McKay, the same issues were vigorously argued in two other cases before the Tribunal. In our view, the decision issued in Mowat v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2003 CHRT 39 should be sufficient to address the issues and concerns raised in the respondent\u2019s motion and provide the guidance sought by the respondents.\nVI.

Grant Sinclair\n2003 CHRT 41\n2003\/12\/08\nINTRODUCTION [1] Maurice Bressette is the complainant is this matter. He filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated March 30, 2002 in which he alleged that the respondent, Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, discriminated against him by not hiring him as a Family Caseworker at the respondent's Children Services Department, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The ground of discrimination alleged is family status.\nFACTS [2] The Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Council is a Band Council as defined in s. 2(1) and established under s. 74 of the Indian Act. The complainant Maurice Bressette is a Status Indian and member of the Kettle and Stony Point First Nation.\n[3] In August 2001, the Band Council established a hiring committee to conduct interviews to staff the position of Family Caseworker in its Children Services Department. This is a budgeted position and is fully funded on an annual formula basis by the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services. The Children Services Department deals with children and family situations within the Band where children or families are experiencing difficulties.\n[4] A number of persons were interviewed for this position, including the complainant, Deb Herman, Dorothy French, Heather Bressette and Georgina Bressette. The hiring committee recommended Deb Herman for the position and also recommended Dorothy French as the alternate. Because Dorothy French questioned the qualifications of Deb Herman for the position, the Band Council did not make any decision to staff the position, but deferred the matter to the Finance\/Personnel Committee.\n[5] Lorraine George, who was the chair of this Committee in 2001, gave evidence on this motion. She said that, at this time, the Band had a deficit of $800,000 and $1,000,000. The Committee had been mandated by the Band Council to identify ways of addressing this deficit. The Committee produced two documents, Deficit Recovery Strategy and the Finance\/Personnel Business Plan which were directed to this problem.\n[6] Some time before the February 6, 2002, Band Council meeting, Stan Sabourin, the Band Administrator, who was cognizant of both the staffing and financial needs, had discussions with Ms. George about reorganizing certain job functions which could result in some savings. He recommended that Eva Bressette, who held the full-time position as Band Representative, be given the position of Family Caseworker and this be done by way of internal transfer.\n[7] Mr. Sabourin also recommended that duties of the Band Representative be assigned to the in-house legal counsel, thus eliminating the separate Band Representative position. The responsibility of the Band Representative is to represent the Band children at hearings which involve child protection issues.\n[8] The Band is funded under various funding agreements with the federal government. The Band general account is funded through CFNFA Contribution Agreements, under which the Band receives core funding and non-core funding. The core funding is for general expenditures. Non-core funding is tied to specific programs and is to be used for that program only.\n[9] The Band Representative is a non-core funding position. The amount of the funding is reviewed annually and is based on the caseload of the previous year. Because the caseload has not been at a level to support the full-time salary of Eva Bressette, the balance is paid from the Band general account. Because her Band Representative duties did not occupy her full time, EvaBresssette did some of the duties of a family caseworker in the Children Services Department.\nBAND COUNCIL AND FINANCE\/PERSONNEL COMMITTEE MINUTES [10] The minutes of the Finance\/Personnel Committee dated Wednesday, February 6, 2002, show that the Committee agreed with the staffing recommendation of Mr. Sabourin relating to the internal transfer of Eva Bressette and that the move be made for financial and professional reasons. There was also a request from Eva Bressette requesting the transfer.\n[11] The minutes of the Band Council meeting of Thursday, March 21, 2002 show that the recommendation to transfer Eva Bressette to the position Family Caseworker was adopted. The minutes also set out that the Band's in-house legal counsel would take on the duties of Band Representative. There is no reference in these minutes to any financial benefits that may accrue from this decision. The implementation of this decision resulted in two staff positions instead of three, one which is fully funded by the province.\nARGUMENT OF THE RESPONDENT IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION [12] The respondent's position is that the Tribunal is without jurisdiction to hear Mr.Bressette's complaint by reason of s. 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 67 provides that nothing in this Act affects any provision of the Indian Act or any provision made under or pursuant to the Indian Act. The respondent argues that the decision to staff the Family Caseworker position and transfer the Band Representative responsibilities to the in-house legal counsel was a decision taken pursuant to the Indian Act and therefore is beyond the scrutiny of this Tribunal. The basis for this assertion, is that the decision of the Band Council was a financial decision with a collateral staffing aspect. The Band had a large deficit and this staff restructuring contributed in a small way to a cost saving.\na) Legal Argument [13] The respondent referred to four cases in which s. 67 of the Indian Act has been considered. The four cases can be divided into two categories, those where the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the complaint, and the second category where jurisdiction was confirmed.\n[14] The first case in the first category is Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), [1995] 3 C.N.L.R. 28 (F.G.T.D.). This case involved s. 115 of the Indian Act, which gave specific power to the Minister of Indian Affairs to decide matters of policy with respect to providing funding for the maintenance of native children attending a residential school. In this case, the Minister adopted a policy requiring native children to attend the school closest to where they resided and the government would no longer fund expenses for those who wished to attend religious schools away from home. The Indian Act also provided in s. 118 that Catholic children could not be assigned to Protestant schools without parental consent.\n[15] The complainant in this case had a daughter who had been attending a Catholic school away from home and was denied further governmental assistance. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal declined jurisdiction on the basis that the Minister's funding decision was a decision under the Indian Act and therefore was exempt under the Act. The Federal Court on review, agreed with the Tribunal that the policy adopted by the Department was specifically authorized under the Indian Act, and as such, was a decision exempt under s. 67 of the Act.\n[16] The next case is Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Gordon Band Council, [2001] 1 F.C.124 (F.C.A.). In this case the complainant was a Status Indian who lived on the Gordon First Nations Band Reserve with her non-Indian spouse. She applied for rental housing on the Reserve, which was denied by the Band Council. She filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission that she had been discriminated against on the basis of sex and family status. The Tribunal concluded that it lacked jurisdiction under s. 67 of the Act. The case was ultimately heard by the Federal Court of Appeal which decided that the decision to refuse housing was a decision made by the Band Council under s. 20 of the Indian Act, which confers on the Band Council authority to deal with possession of land on the Reserve.\n[17] The first case in the second category of cases is Desjarlais v. Piapot Band, No 75 [1989] 3 F.C. 605 (F.C.A.). In this case, the Band fired its Band Administrator pursuant to a formal resolution of the Band Council. The resolution was a vote of non-confidence for Ms.RoseDesjarlais based on complaints because of her age. The Band Council terminated her employment and she filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging discrimination because of age.\n[18] The Federal Court of Appeal held that a vote of non-confidence is nowhere expressly or impliedly provided for by the Indian Act. Accordingly it was not a decision taken pursuant to the Indian Act and the complaint could be heard by the Tribunal.\n[19] The last case is McNutt v. Shubenacadie Indian Band, [1998] 2 F.C. 198 (F.T.D.); 256 N.R. 109 (F.C.A.). In this case, a non-Indian spouse who lived on the reserve with the permission of the Band Council, was denied social assistance from the Band. The federal government had contracted with the Band to provide funding for social assistance on the Reserve. The Band Council administered the social assistance program in accordance with the contractual provisions which included guidelines. Under s. 3.01 of the Guidelines, a non-Indian spouse who resided legally on the reserve was clearly eligible for benefits.\n[20] The Federal Court held that the Band Council's decision to deny benefits did not come within s. 67 of the Act. Although this was a decision by the Band Council, the Court pointed out that not all decisions of a Band Council are immunized by s. 67 of the Act. The social assistance program and the authority of the Band to administer it was pursuant to the contract between the Federal Government and the Band, not under the Indian Act. As such, s. 67 of the Act did not apply.\n[21] The respondent agreed that if the decision of the Band Council was a staffing decision, s.67 would not operate to oust the Tribunal's jurisdiction. But, the respondent argued, the Band Council's decision must be viewed as a package. What appears initially to be a staffing matter really is part of an overall financial strategy directed to reducing the Band's financial deficit.\n[22] The respondent first referred to ss. 69, 81 and 83 of the Indian Act as supporting the Band Council's decision as a financial decision under the Indian Act. In the final analysis, however, the respondent looked to two Regulations under the Indian Act. The first is the Indian Band Revenue Moneys Order, SOR\/90-297 as am., which provides that the Bands listed in the Regulation are permitted to control, manage, expend their revenue moneys. The second is the Indian Band Revenue Moneys Regulations, C.R.C. 1978 c. 953 as am., which provides that any expenditure by a Band of revenue monies is subject to the Indian Act.\n[23] The respondent argues that these two Regulations permit the Band Council to manage, control and expend its revenues, which actions are subject to the Indian Act. Because the Band Council's motivation for the restructuring and staffing of the two positions was primarily for financial reasons, and is authorized by these Regulations, it must be concluded that the impugned decision taken was pursuant to the Indian Act.\nTHE COMMISSION'S POSITION [24] The Commission characterizes the decision of the Band Council in the opposite way. For the Commission, the staffing of the Family Caseworker position was the primary purpose for the Band Council's decision. The so-called financial decision was not a strategy referred to in either of the two position papers put out by the Finance\/Personnel Committee. It was only after the hiring committee's decision was challenged and deferred to the Finance Committee, was this restructuring recommendation brought forward.\na) Legal Argument [25] The Commission referred to a recent decision of this Tribunal in Bernard v. Waycobah Board of Education, (1999), 36 C.H.R.R. D\/51 (CHRT). In this case the complainant was a member of the Waycobah First Nation. Her employment as school secretary was terminated by the Board of Education because of her conduct on two or three occasions which led the Board to believe that she had a mental disability. She filed a complaint with the Commission alleging discrimination on the ground of disability.\n[26] The respondent argued that s. 114 (2) of the Indian Act, which authorizes the Minister to establish, operate and maintain schools for Indian children, authorized the Board of Education to make the decision it did. The Tribunal rejected the respondent's argument that the Tribunal had no juristiction to hear the complaint. In its view, there was not a sufficient link between s. 114(2) and the decision of the Board.\nANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION [27] In my view, the decision of the respondent involves both a staffing aspect and a financial aspect. But, in my opinion, the predominant purpose behind the decision of the Band Council was to staff the Family Caseworker position. The fact that a small financial benefit resulted does not detract from this conclusion.\n[28] This is demonstrated by the chronology of events in which a hiring committee was struck to select a candidate for the position of Family Caseworker. The choice of the hiring committee was challenged and for this reason, the Band Council deferred the matter to the Finance Committee. It was not deferred because of financial considerations or because a new strategy was adopted. The position had to be staffed and money was allocated for the position. From the beginning, it was a staffing need not a financial need, that drove the whole process.\n[29] Further, in my view, none of the cases cited by the respondent are similar to this case. On the other hand, the Waycobah decision is much more akin in that both facts situations involve a staffing decision. In Waycobah, there was not a sufficient nexus between the decision of the Band Council and the Indian Act. In my opinion, none of the provisions of the Indian Act cited by the respondent, including the two Regulations, supply this nexus.\n[30] Every staffing decision involves the control, management or the expenditure of money. The consequence of the respondent's position is that any staffing decision of a Band Council would be beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Even the respondent conceded that this could not and should not be the case under the Indian Act.\nORDER [31] For the foregoing reasons, the motion of the Kettle and the Stony Point First Nation Band Council is hereby dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ.

Grant Sinclair\nDr. Paul Groarke\n2003 CHRT 42\n2003\/12\/08\n[1] The following application deals with an objection from the respondent with respect to the Commission's participation in the hearing. The objection arises out of correspondence between the Commission and the respondent, in which the Commission advised the respondent that it would restrict its participation in the hearing to an enhanced opening statement and a watching brief.\n[2] In a letter to the parties dated October 10, 2003, the Commission wrote as follows:\nAs to the extent of the Commission's participation, at this time it is anticipated that the Commission's role in the hearing will be limited to providing an enhanced opening statement following by a watching brief as the case is heard. The Commission will of course be involved in the implementation and enforcement of any resulting Tribunal order. That said, the Commission reserves the right to take a full role in the hearing as it sees fit or is required to take as the case progresses.\nThe respondent was not satisfied with this means of proceeding.\n[3] At a later point, the respondent requested further elaboration of the contents of the enhanced opening statement. In a letter dated October 30, 2003, the Commission advised:\nOur opening statement will refer to case law and the principles set out therein. We will not refer to evidence nor will we be taking a position as to how the Tribunal should address the issues that may arise in the case in light of the allegations and unproven facts contained in the Complaint Form. This admittedly non-traditional opening statement is a highlighting of principles that apply to a case of this nature. It is not a presentation or forecast as to what the evidence will ultimately show.\nThe respondent does not accept that it is possible to restrict the proposed opening statement in this way and objects to anything less than the full participation of the Comission in the hearing.\n[4] The respondent has applied for a ruling from the Tribunal that the Commission cannot restrict its participation in the hearing in this manner. It has also argued that the Commission must participate fully in the hearing or absent itself from the entire proceeding. The Commission has opposed the respondent's application, primarily on the basis that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the extent of the Commission's participation in the hearing. In making this submission, counsel relied chiefly on the principle that the Tribunal has no authority to review the decisions of the Commission.\n[5] We have already dealt with the issue of an opening address in Mowat v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2003 CHRT 39. We were advised by counsel for the Commission during argument that the enhanced opening statement that the Commission had contemplated in the present case was similar in form and content to the opening statement to be given in the cases of Howell v. Canadian Armed Forces and McKay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n[6] In our view, the Commission is obliged to respect the jurisprudence on opening statements, the Canadian Human Rights Act, and the Rules of the Tribunal in the preparation and provision of such statements. The purpose of an opening statement is to provide an outline of what is to follow. In a case where the Commission has no intention of presenting evidence or participating further in the case, an opening statement is of little assistance. The case law would suggest that any submissions on the law are more appropriately made at the end of the case.\n[7] It is for the parties who are participating fully in the case to frame the issues in the hearing. If the Commission wants a role in such a process, it accordingly has an obligation to participate in the production of evidence and the presentation of argument at the logical time. It would be unfair for the Commission to raise issues that must be answered, in its absence, by the other parties to the process.\n[8] It will be apparent from our decision in Mowat that we do not accept the Commission's characterization of the matter as a jurisdictional issue. The Tribunal recognizes that it has no jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Commission, which is a matter for the Federal Court. The Tribunal is nevertheless the master of its own process and has a responsibility to ensure that the proceedings before it are conducted in a way that respects the principles of fairness and natural justice.\n[9] There is also the question of a watching brief. This is a term which is open to interpretation. It is unclear to us, at this point in time, what the Commission means by a watching brief. There is no doubt that the Commission has a right to participate as it chooses in every hearing before the Tribunal, subject to the Tribunal's responsibility to ensure that the principles of fairness and natural justice are respected.\n[10] In our view, this is sufficient to deal with the motion before us. The Commission will not be permitted to submit the proposed statement at the beginning of the hearing. The extent of the Commission's obligation to participate fully or not at all is a question for the Federal Court. Any other issues that the respondent raises with respect to the Comission's participation can be dealt with by the Tribunal hearing the case.\nSigned by\nJ.

INTRODUCTION [1] This is a motion by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) to add the Department of Public Works and Government Services and the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency as Respondents to the proceedings. The motion arises out of a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act regarding the York Street Steps, which are found in the market area of downtown Ottawa, to the east of Parliament Hill and the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier. These Steps come within the responsibility of the National Capital Commission (NCC), the Respondent in the proceedings, and were recently reconstructed to accommodate the new American embassy. The NCC is responsible for the development, conservation and improvement of the nature and character of the National Capital.\n[2] It is accepted on all sides that York Street is one of the major promenades in the market area. It runs west to Sussex Drive, where there is a T intersection. Along the bar of the T, there is a steep upward slope between Sussex Drive and Mackenzie Street. Immediately across the street, at the same intersection, there are the York Street Steps, which climb this acclivity to Mackenzie Street. On the other side of Mackenzie Street, there is an entrance to Major Hill Park. The Park boasts a view of the back of Parliament Hill and the Ottawa River and is frequently used for outdoor festivals.\n[3] The Complainant uses a wheelchair. He alleges that the National Capital Commission has discriminated against him on the basis of disability by failing to provide him with access to Mackenzie Street at the York Street Steps. The Complainant and the Commission want this situation rectified. They complain that the Steps are not accessible to those in wheelchairs or indeed, to anyone who is physically unable to traverse the stairs. The Complainant and the Commission have argued that the case raises important issues with respect to universal access.\n[4] The hearing in the case has already commenced. The Complainant has finished his evidence. The Commission has begun its examination-in-chief of David Lloyd Rapson, an expert in universal access. The problem giving rise to the present motion arose when Mr. Rapson testified that there was an obvious solution to the lack of access at the York Street Steps. This solution was to be found next door.\n[5] The Steps are owned by the National Capital Commission, also in the name of the Crown. There is a large historic building immediately south of the steps, known as the Connaught Building. This building is owned by Public Works, also in the name of the Crown. Mr. Rapson felt that those who cannot use the York Street Steps could be provided with an alternative means of access to Mackenzie Street through the Connaught Building.\n[6] The Connaught Building is a large stone building, oblong in shape, that runs north and south between Sussex Drive and Mackenzie Street. It has a rather stern medieval look, with crenellated turrets and external stone buttresses. Since the building is built into the hill, and Mackenzie Street is three floors higher than Sussex Drive, its front and back entrances open on different floors.\n[7] When Mr. Rapson studied the York Street site, he discovered a disused entrance at the north end of the building, off Sussex Drive, adjacent to the York Street Steps. He also discovered that there was an elevator shaft at the same end of the building. There is a major exit onto Mackenzie Street, three floors up. Mr. Rapson suggested that this shaft could be used to provide elevator access between the two streets. This would presumably be less expensive than the construction of an elevator or lift at the Steps themselves.\n[8] The Commission has filed an affidavit with its Notice of Motion, containing copies of correspondence with both the NCC and Public Works concerning the Connaught Building. It is apparent from this correspondence, and the testimony that has already been heard, that some preliminary inquiries were made. The investigator's supplementary report, which is before me, states that the Respondent 'should consult with the appropriate persons to secure the use of the building. At some point, however, it appears that the negotiations between the various parties fell through..\n[9] During Mr. Rapson's evidence in chief, I asked the Commission if it was asking the Tribunal to consider the use of the Connaught Building as an alternate means of access to Mackenzie Street. It is evident that this would require an order that the owners of the Connaught Building make its premises available to the public. It might also require an order that modifications be made to the building. When the Commission confirmed that it was seeking this kind of relief, I expressed concern over the fact that the owner of the Connaught Building was not before the Tribunal.\n[10] The hearing was then adjourned, so that counsel for the Commission could receive instructions. The Commission then brought the present motion, which seeks to add Public Works and the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency as respondents to the proceedings. Public Works is the landlord of the building, which is leased to the Revenue Agency. At the hearing of the motion, the Department of Justice acted on behalf of both of these parties. It was agreed on all sides that there was no need to seek an order adding the Revenue Agency as a party.\n[11] The Complainant has made it clear that he is seeking some form of access to Mackenzie Street at the same location as the steps. He nevertheless supports the motion and feels that the Tribunal should consider the possibility of an alternate access through the Connaught Building. Public Works is objecting to the Motion. NCC has taken no position and indicates that it is content to leave the matter with the Tribunal.\nII. THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES [12] The Commission's position is that Public Works should be named as a Respondent to the Complaint for the purposes of remedy. Although the Commission submits that Public Works may have directly discriminated against the Complainant, it is not relying on such a submission for the purposes of the motion. I think the suggestion is that a refusal to assist in rectifying a discriminatory situation may constitute a direct form of discrimination in itself.\n[13] The Commission's immediate concern is that the Tribunal may not be able to order the appropriate remedy without the participation of Public Works. This would implicitly defeat the purposes of the Act. The Complainant has joined in the submissions of the Commission.\n[14] There is no explanation for the Commission's failure to add Public Works as a Respondent before referring the matter to the Tribunal. This must simply be put down to an error on the part of the Commission. Although the Commission recognizes that Public Works should have been added earlier, it argues that any prejudice can be addressed by an adjournment and the production of documents.\n[15] Public Works objects to the motion, primarily on jurisdictional grounds. It argues that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to add a party as a Respondent without an allegation that the party has discriminated against the Complainant. I think this must be read, for reasons that will become apparent, as a submission that Public Works cannot be added as a Respondent without an allegation that it has directly discriminated against the Complainant as the principal in the discrimination.\n[16] Public Works has also argued that the Commission is out of time, but that argument is answered by the fact that the complaint is a continuing complaint. There is a third line of argument that the addition of Public Works as a Respondent at this stage of the process is prejudicial.\nIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S POWER TO ADD PARTIES [17] The jurisprudence of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal dealing with the addition of parties is of recent origin. In an oral ruling, in Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, T701\/0602; October 2, 2002; vol. 1, at p. 46, Chairperson Mactavish observed that section 48.9(2) of the [Canadian Human Rights] Act specifically contemplates the addition of both parties and interested parties to inquiries before the Tribunal. The provision in question gives the Tribunal the power to make rules governing the addition of parties to the proceedings.\n[18] Although the Tribunal is in the process of revising its rules, the current rules of the Tribunal are silent on the matter. The matter has been considered in a number of cases however and there is no arguing with the Act. In my view, the Canadian Human Rights Act contemplates that the Tribunal may add a party to a complaint after it has been referred to the Tribunal. The fact that a hearing before a Tribunal is an inquiry would support such a conclusion, since it suggests that there is an exploratory aspect to such a process that may not be present in other litigation.\n[19] I have reviewed the Rules of Court from a variety of superior courts, which generally state that the Courts may add a party where the addition of the party is necessary to decide all of the matters in dispute or provide a complete and effective solution of the matter. Other members have held that the Tribunal's power to add parties should only be invoked in a situation where it is necessary for the proper airing of a complaint. There are many reasons for this. It goes without saying, for example, that a party that is added to a proceeding in the circumstances before me will not have had the benefits of the investigative process at the Commission.\n[20] The most recent decision from the Tribunal is Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-t\u00e9l\u00e9phone v. Telus Comunications, 2003 CHRT 31, where Member Deschamps held at para. 30 as follows :\n[Translation] The Tribunal is of the opinion that the forced addition of a new respondent once the Tribunal has been requested to inquire into a complaint is appropriate, in the absence of formal rules to this effect, if it is established that the presence of this new party is necessary to dispose of the complaint before the Tribunal and that it was not reasonably foreseable, once the complaint was filed with the Commission, that the addition of a new respondent would be necessary to dispose of the complaint.\nI accept this as a general statement of the current law.\n[21] The facts were substantially different in the Telus case, however, which was more in the nature of a motion to add a third party. This is an important distinction: the motion to add a party in that case was based on a submission that the union was directly and fundamentally liable. The remedy that was sought by the Complainant was also an employment remedy, which was never imperiled by the failure to add the union as a Respondent. It follows that the addition of the union was not required, in any strict sense, to resolve the issues in the case.\n[22] In my view, there is an additional factor in the immediate case, which is more significant than the question of foreseability. The purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act is to remedy discrimination and the Tribunal's power to add parties must be subordinated to that purpose. This goes to the nature of the process. Although the Tribunal deals with the private rights and obligations of the parties that come before it, insofar as they engage the rights protected by the Act, human rights hearings have a constitutional component that is often missing in the civil law.\n[23] This brings in public policy concerns that do not arise in private litigation. In my view, litigation before the tribunal is public interest litigation, even when it concerns the private interests of the parties. The civil rules regarding the addition of parties must be tailored to the mandate of the Tribunal, which is to provide an effective remedy for discrimination. If it is necessary to add Public Works as a Respondent in order to provide the kind of remedy contemplated by the Act, it seems to me that this must take precedence over the lack of foresight of the Commission.\nIV. SECTION 53 OF THE ACT [24] The jurisdictional argument raised by Public Works is based on the wording of Section53(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. That subsection contemplates an order against the person found to be engaging . . . in the discriminatory practice. Public Works accordingly submits that it cannot be added as a party without some reliable evidence on which the Tribunal could make a finding that it was the person engaging in the discriminatory conduct.\n[25] As I understand it, the Commission has no immediate intention of asking for a finding that Public Works is directly liable, as the principal in the discrimination, and is rather seeking an ancillary order of some kind, which would allow it to execute any decision against NCC in the most appropriate manner. I should say, in passing, that I do not believe it is fair for the Commission to reserve its position on the question whether Public Works is liable as a principal until a later date.\n[26] Public Works has argued that it should not be added as a party merely because it is part of the apparatus of the Crown. The Commission's response to this submission appears to be twofold. Its first argument is that NCC and Public Works can be considered as one person for the purposes of remedy under Section 53 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Its second argument is that the Tribunal has the power to make whatever ancillary orders are necessary to facilitate the orders contemplated under section 53.\nA. The person of Public Works [27] I initially expressed some misgivings about the Commission's first line of reasoning. NCC and Public Works are discrete persons in law. The separation of the budgets and responsibilities of these agencies is an important attribute of their legal identity. It would be a mistake to think that the Tribunal can somehow merge their identities for the purposes of the hearing.\n[28] There is nevertheless something to the argument advanced by the Commission. The Canadian Human Rights Act is remedial and the word person must be given a large and liberal interpretation. Although Public Works and NCC are separate in law, they are both creatures of the Federal Crown. It is accepted on all sides that the underlying title in both properties vests in the Federal Crown. It is simply not enough in law to say that the two properties are owned by different legal persons.\n[29] The situation might be different if the NCC and Public Works were private parties. Even in such a case, however, one can imagine a situation in which the adjoining properties were owned by different companies, A and B, each of which was owned by a third company, C. Although A and B would be separate in law, they would both be subservient to the interests of C and one can think of situations where a court or tribunal might feel it necessary to pierce the corporate veil that separates them.\n[30] Here it is the indivisibility of the Crown that requires consideration. This is an idea with many limits. In Liability of the Crown (Toronto: Carswell, 1989), for example, at page 10, Professor Hogg writes:\nThere is only one individual at any time who is the Queen (or King). The Crown accordingly has a monolithic connotation, which has sometimes been articulated in dicta such as that the Crown is one and indivisible. For nearly all purposes the idea of the Crown as one and indivisible is thoroughly misleading. ...\nThe immediate case may nevertheless present one of those unusual situations where the unity of the Crown is significant.\n[31] The Crown has a specific interest in remedying discrimination. One would accordingly think that any devolution of the Crown's authority would carry some element of the public interest with it. If the Crown has an interest in rectifying discrimination, there is accordingly room for an argument that its servants share that interest. The point is that this interest does not stop arbitrarily at the doorstep of its agents. This might be sufficient to bridge the identities of NCC and the Department of Public Works for the purposes of Section 53.\n[32] The legal question maybe whether some aspect of the Crown's interest in remedying discrimination infuses the responsibilities and purposes of its agents. The Commission apparently feels that there is enough of a nexus to join the persons of the NCC and Public Works for the purpose of remedy under Section 53 of the Act. There is a sense in which the NCC, as an agent of the Crown and owner of the York Street Steps, shares the identity of the agent of the Crown that owns the adjacent property.\n[33] The Commission has provided me with authorities, principally Canadian Pacific v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) [1991] 1 F.C. 571 (C.A.) and Canada (AG) v. Rosin [1991] 1 F.C. 391 (C.A.), which demonstrate that human rights legislation should be interpreted in a manner that takes a Tribunal beyond the more specific prescriptions of the Act. The question at this stage of the process, however, is merely whether the Commission has raised a triable issue. I am dealing with a preliminary motion, and it would be premature to enter into an analysis of the law.\n[34] This observation is reinforced by the fact that I have yet to decide the facts in the case. There may be many reasons why the Connaught Building cannot be used as an alternative means of access. This is a subject for the hearing however, and the only question before me is whether the Tribunal should inquire into the matter. This is not possible without the participation of Public Works in the hearing.\nB. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal to add a party for the purposes of remedy [35] The second response of the Commission to the arguments of Public Works under Section53 of the Act is that the Tribunal has the authority to make supplementary orders, in aid of any finding of liability. This would give the Tribunal the power to make an order against a party solely for the purposes of remedy. The Commission's position is that an order against the NCC may be of no assistance in the immediate case without a supplementary order against the Department of Public Works.\n[36] It is important to be careful with the wording of the proposition put forward by the Commission. This is because there is a logical sense, at least, in which there is no remedy without some form of liability. The argument before me is rather that the liabilities under the Act extend beyond those who are directly responsible for the acts that have given rise to the complaint. The Commission is arguing that Public Works is liable under section 53 in some less direct and secondary sense, almost as if it was an accessory rather than a principal in the discrimination.\n[37] Under the Canadian Human Rights Act, Mr. Brown has a right to the enjoyment of the usual liberties and rights, without discrimination. The argument is that this gives rise to positive duties under the Act, which require that Public Works co-operate with the other parties in attempting to redress the alleged discrimination at the York Street Steps. This may give rise to a duty to assist the NCC in its accommodation of people with disabilities. The public policy reasons for this are obvious: without such assistance, the NCC may not be able to provide the natural remedy for the alleged discrimination.\n[38] The failure of an agent of the Crown to provide the disabled with the same physical access to public places as other people is a matter of general concern. This raises a different set of considerations than employment matters, which generally arise out of a dispute between opposing parties. If it is a matter of giving Mr. Brown the opportunity to exercise rights, which stand, in some conceptual sense, in rem, against the world, the issues in the case cannot be restricted to the parties in the immediate dispute.\n[39] On the Commission's view, the owner of the Connaught Building has obligations that go beyond the obvious prohibitions in the Act, in remedying the alleged discrimination at the York Street Steps. It is evident that issues like fault are less important in this context than the overriding need to find a viable solution to the problem that has arisen with respect to the Steps. This is in keeping with much of the earlier jurisprudence, such as Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board) [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84, for example, at para.11 in particular. Like other people who are disabled, Mr. Brown is not that interested in the ownership of the two adjoining properties. His position is very simple. He wants the same access to Mackenzie Street as other people.\n[40] This requires a physical remedy and cannot be solved by compensation. There are situations in the law, such as expropriation, where public rights take precedence over the interests of a private or a public owner of land. If a bus stop needs to be enlarged, to accommodate those who use wheelchairs, this may inevitably infringe on the rights of an adjacent property owner. I suppose the Commission has no answer for those who say otherwise: the argument is simply that there are situations where the Canadian Human Rights Act requires that our private interests be subordinated to the common good.\n[41] The problem with the position adopted by Public Works is that it may leave persons who are discriminated against without an effective remedy. If I have to choose between the right of Public Works to stay out of the dispute and the rights of the disabled, I would think that any reading of the purpose and preamble of the Act leaves little doubt as to where my responsibilities lie. The Commission is entitled to follow discrimination to its logical remedy, in accordance with the larger public interest, wherever that remedy might lead.\n[42] If the Commission or another party is of the view that it is necessary to add a party, in order to provide a remedy for discrimination, I think it is entitled to make the kind of motion that has been made before me. The question of fairness will always be an issue on such a motion. But that goes to the question of prejudice and not to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. I think the Act gives the Tribunal discretion, and a relatively informal discretion, to add a party if that meets the needs of justice and the purposes of the Act. It is interesting that Mr. Hadjis added a complainant in Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail v. Barbe, T736\/4102, May 6, 2003, Vol. 2, pp. 205-288, for the purposes of remedy.\n[43] There is no escaping the fact that the Commission should have foreseen the present eventuality and added Public Works to the complaint before referring the matter to the Tribunal. Regrettable as this may be, the reality is that Public Works may have an indispensable part to play in resolving any question of discrimination that arises at the York Street Steps. All other matters aside, I find it difficult to understand why Public Works would force the NCC to solve the problem in a way that would impose a more expensive solution on the public.\n[44] If the case before me raised private issues in the civil law, the matter might be different. This is not private litigation however and the public interest is paramount. The question of discrimination is simply too important to be defeated by such procedural irregularities. The public and constitutional concerns that raise themselves in the present context outweigh any fault that may accrue to the Commission.\n[45] I realize that the Commission's position has many implications for the parties, both inside and outside the hearing. At the present time, however, the only issue before me is whether the Commission is entitled to raise these issues in the course of the hearing. I think the answer to such a question must be in the affirmative. I am making no findings on the merits of the case and the matter is still open to argument at the end of the hearing.\nV. PREJUDICE [46] The final argument raised by Public Works is prejudice. This rests primarily on the fact that the department has lost the benefits that generally accrue to a Respondent during the investigative process. This is an important consideration, which is offset by the fact that this will usually be the case, if a Respondent is added after a complaint has been referred to the Tribunal under the Act.\n[47] The reality is that Mr. Brown could file a new complaint tomorrow, with Public Works as a Respondent. The Commission could then refer the matter to the Tribunal under section 49(1) of the Act, with or without an investigation. In my view it would be inappropriate to rely on this kind of formal maneuvering to bring Public Works before the Tribunal.\n[48] The idea that the Complainant would have to file a second complaint to deal with the issues that might arise with Public Works runs against the spirit of the Act. This would merely delay the satisfaction of any rights to which the Complainant may be entitled and use up the scarce resources of the system of justice. If Public Works is a proper party in the matter, it should be brought in as expeditiously as possible, in a manner that deals naturally with all of the issues that arise out of the complaint before me. I see no reason why any deficiencies in the process cannot be made up by giving Counsel for the Department of Public Works the necessary time to prepare her case.\nVI. CONCLUSION AND DIRECTION [49] The purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act is to rectify discrimination. This consideration is paramount. In my view, it would be wrong to reject the Commission's motion and possibly deprive the Complainant and the public of their proper remedy, merely because a mistake was made by the Commission in pursuing the case. This is a public rather than a private matter and the public interest comes first.\n[50] I am accordingly directing that the Department of Public Works and Government Services be added as a Co-respondent to the case before me. This will allow the hearing to resume. This is subject to the requirements of natural justice. In fairness to the other parties, the Commission is obliged to comply with the requirements of Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure and provide the other parties with an amended statement of issues, in the style of the civil courts, with all of the changes conspicuously marked. The Respondent is entitled to know the case against it.\n[51] Counsel for Public Works has already indicated that she would need three or four months to review the disclosure and prepare her case. I would ask the other parties to accommodate her in this regard. It will also be necessary to recall the Complainant, for the purposes of cross-examination. The testimony of Mr. Rapson can continue. I would ask the parties to confer among themselves as to the order in which witnesses should be called when we resume.\n[52] There is one other aspect of the matter that deserves mention. It appears that there have been extensive negotiations to try and resolve the continuing issue at the Steps. Since this is the first time that Public Works has been brought into the case, it may be possible to revisit these negotiations and resolve some aspects of the matter without formal intervention. If the Tribunal may be of service in this regard, the parties should advise the Tribunal Registry Officer accordingly.\nsigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nDecember 9, 2003\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE NO.: T760\/1003\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Bob Brown v.

FACTS\nIII. ISSUE DURING THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\nIV. LEGAL ANALYSIS\nV. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] On August, 27, 2003, counsel for the respondent, Robert Bonhomme, Esq., raised a preliminary objection regarding the jurisdiction of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) for dealing with the constitutionality of a provision in its enabling legislation. Specifically, he contended that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to answer the complainant's question regarding the constitutionality of paragraph 15(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act)1.\n[2] Following a teleconference held on September 11, 2003, it was agreed that the issue of the Tribunal's jurisdiction would be argued first and that questions relating to the substance would be handled after the Tribunal's decision on the preliminary objection.\n[3] The hearing for the preliminary objection took place in Montreal on November 17, 2003.\nII. FACTS [4] Francine Laurendeau (the complainant) was employed at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (the respondent) from 1973 first as a producer, and then from 1989 as a producer and host of the respondent's Cha\u00eene culturelle.\n[5] On July 12, 2001, the respondent retired the complainant. This decision was made under a policy in effect with the respondent since 1978 and entitled Human Resource Policy No. 10.0, which states: Retirement is based on age and is set as the last working day of the month in which the employee turns 65 years old.\n[6] In anticipation of being retired, the complainant filed a complaint on June 6, 2001 with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) to contest the respondent's decision. In her complaint, she alleged that the respondent acted in a discriminatory manner towards [her], by maintaining a mandatory retirement policy, because of [her] age (65), contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[7] On November 26, 2002, the Commission's investigator filed her investigation report on the complaint. Given paragraph 15(1)(c)2, the Commission's investigator recommended pursuant to [paragraph] 44(3)(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, that the Commission dismiss the complaint. Upon receipt of this report, the Commission invited the complainant to make additional representations, which she did on December 20, 2002.\n[8] On February 27, 2003, the Commission informed the complainant and the respondent of its decision, following the investigation report. Among other things, it indicated:\nAfter reviewing this information, the Commission has decided, pursuant to section 49 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to ask the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to appoint a member to inquire into the complaint because the Commission is satisfied that, under the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted.\n[9] On April 1st, 2003, the Registrar of the Tribunal informed the parties of their rights under section 50(1) of the Act to present evidence and legal representations to support their position in this case. In accordance with the Tribunal's Internal Rules of Procedure, the Registrar also asked the parties to submit short written statements listing the issues and the evidence that would be submitted to the Tribunal.\n[10] In her disclosure of evidence filed on August 20, 2003, the complainant stated the issues as follows:\nDid the CBC commit an age-related discriminatory practice in violation of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by terminating Ms. Laurendeau's employment solely on the basis that she had reached 65 years of age? Alternatively, and if the Tribunal finds that the CBC's discriminatory practice falls within the exception of paragraph 15(1)(c), is this paragraph of the Canadian Human Rights Act unconstitutional by being contrary to section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[11] On August 27, 2003, the respondent informed the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) that it intended to raise a preliminary objection and argue that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to answer the complainant's question on the constitutionality of paragraph 15(1)(c) of the Act.\nIII. ISSUE DURING THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTION [12] Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal have the jurisdiction to decide a question on the constitutionality of a provision in its enabling legislation, specifically paragraph 15(1)(c) of the Act?\nIV. LEGAL ANALYSIS [13] The issue of whether an administrative tribunal has the jurisdiction to decide a question on the constitutionality of a provision in its enabling legislation has been the subject of several Supreme Court of Canada decisions. We simply have to consider the decisions rendered by that Court in Douglas\/Kwanten, Faculty Assn. v. Douglas College3, Cuddy Chicks Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board)4, T\u00e9treault-Gadoury v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission)5, Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission)6 and more recently in Nova Scotia (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Martin7.\n[14] For the purpose of this decision, we will consider the latter two cases in particular, namely Cooper and Martin.\n[15] In his argument, counsel for the respondent greatly stressed the fact that, according to paragraph 44(3)(a) and section 49(1) of the Act, the Tribunal may not have a complaint before it unless it is following a request from the Commission. He concluded that, in this context, the Tribunal's jurisdiction is dependent on the Commission's jurisdiction. In other words, if the Commission does not have the jurisdiction for deciding an issue, the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction either.\n[16] In support of this argument, the respondent relied on two Quebec Court of Appeal decisions, namely Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure G\u00e9n\u00e9rale) v. Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse8 and Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure G\u00e9n\u00e9rale) v. Human Rights Tribunal9.\n[17] In the first case, the respondent chiefly referred to comments by Rousseau-Houle J. who, for the majority, stated that The Tribunal's jurisdiction is dependent on referrals from the Commission. [...]10 and those of Robert J. who, dissenting, mentioned As we have seen earlier, the Tribunal is dependent on referrals from the Commission. 11\n[18] Then, in reference to Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure G\u00e9n\u00e9rale) v. Human Rights Tribunal, the respondent mentioned the following passage from the Quebec Court of Appeal decision:\nAll parties before the Court properly recognize that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is dependent on referrals from the Commission. The Commission's jurisdiction to make the application in this appeal determines the Tribunal's jurisdiction to have this before it. [...]12\n[19] To understand the three short excerpts from these decisions, we must take our analysis of them a little further. First, recall that the issue in Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) v. Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse was as follows: should the principle of exclusive arbitral authority that is firmly established in Quebec yield to a theory that favours exclusiveness or even competing jurisdictions between the grievances arbitrator and the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal because the dispute raises a question about human rights?13 A question that deals essentially with the jurisdiction of the Quebec tribunal, in consideration of the grievance arbitrator's exclusive jurisdiction; a question that is very different from the one before us here. In this case, none of the parties is questioning the fact that the Commission had full jurisdiction to hear the complaint filed by the complainant, and nobody is contesting the jurisdiction of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to have the complaint before it. The issue involves the Tribunal's jurisdiction for deciding a question on the constitutionality of a provision in the Act.\n[20] It is interesting that Rousseau-Houle J. is aware of the distinction between the federal and provincial legislation regarding the exclusive jurisdiction of the grievance arbitrator. She states:\nSome Canadian human rights legislation contains provisions that eliminate the possibility for complaints from affected individuals to be simultaneously or successively referred to agencies responsible for this legislation and to grievance arbitrators. Thus, section 41 of the Canadian Human Rights Act and section 34(1) of the Human Rights Code of Ontario empowers the Human Rights Commission to not proceed with a complaint if it believes that the complainant has appropriate alternative recourse including the grievance process. In this regard, we see that, in Cooper v. Canadian Human Rights Commission regarding the jurisdiction of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to review the constitutionality of its enabling legislation, airline pilots who had to retire at age 60 in accordance with the collective agreement applied to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, not to the grievance arbitrator, because the Canadian Human Rights Act allowed it.14\n[21] Therefore, if the same question had been raised at the federal level, everything seems to indicate that the decision could have been different.\n[22] A little further on, speaking on the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms of Quebec15, she adds:\nIn Quebec law, the Charter's provisions assigning jurisdiction to the Tribunal do not, in my view, eliminate the exclusive jurisdiction of the grievance arbitrator when the dispute, in its factual background, results explicitly or implicitly from the collective agreement.16\n[23] Faced with the exclusive jurisdiction of the grievance arbitrator, the Quebec Commission could not lodge its application with the Human Rights Tribunal and should have stated that it lacked jurisdiction ratione materiae.17\n[24] Given the particular situation in this case, I do not see how this is relevant for deciding the issue before us here. In Quebec, the legislator has explicitly allowed that remedies for ensuring respect for Quebec Charter rights shall be exercised before forums other than the Tribunal. As a result, the Quebec Court of Appeal found that the principle of exclusive arbitral authority shall prevail since the dispute arose essentially from the application of the collective agreement and that the Labour Code is able to govern all aspects of the relations between the parties within the context of labour relations.18\n[25] In Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) v. Human Rights Tribunal, the issues that the Court was asked to consider dealt with the authority of the Commission qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des droits de la personne to make an application regarding the validity or opposability of a legislative provision in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and with respect to the jurisdiction of the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal for deciding it.\n[26] After closely reviewing this decision, I observe that, from several perspectives, it does not necessarily support the respondent's position. As an example, I considered the following passage in the decision:\nThe Supreme Court of Canada cases shows that the legislator's intent must be determined in order to decide whether the administrative tribunal has jurisdiction to rule on general questions of law, which includes the authority to decide on the constitutional validity of a legislative provision. The analysis must go beyond simply finding a text that explicitly grants a given power. In the absence of an explicit provision depriving a tribunal of a power, its enabling legislation must be interpreted to give that body, which the legislator intended to be efficient, the necessary powers to carry out its mission. In Dunedin, dealing with the power of the justice of the peace in a dispute involving the Provincial Offences Act, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court even seemed to give the tribunals a presumption of jurisdiction in the absence of a text excluding it\nThe functional and structural approach achieves this balance between real access to remedies provided for by the Charter and deference to the role of the legislative authorities. It rests on the theory that says, when a legislator gives a judicial or administrative tribunal a function leading it to decide issues likely to involve Charter rights and provides it with procedures for fairly and equitably ruling on these ancillary questions connected with the Charter, it must be deduced, in the absence of any contrary intent, that the legislator intended to empower the tribunal to enforce the Charter.19\n[27] The passage from Dunedin, cited by the Quebec Court of Appeal, is even more applicable to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal since in the Act, as we will see further on, there is a provision explicitly granting it the authority to decide questions of law and that it is provided with procedures for fairly and equitably ruling on these questions.\n[28] As with the Attorney General of Quebec in Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) v. Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse, the respondent in the matter at hand greatly stressed what it believes is the decisive impact of the Cooper case. The respondent concluded from it that the Commission lacks the authority to determine whether a provision in the Act, which it must otherwise respect and implement, is invalid and that, as a result, the Tribunal as well lacks the authority to invalidate a provision in the Act. The respondent reiterated the comments of La Forest J. in Cooper to support its conclusion:\nGiven my finding that the Commission does not have the jurisdiction to question the constitutional validity of its enabling statute, it logically follows that a tribunal appointed under the Act, and indeed a review tribunal appointed pursuant to s. 56, must also lack the jurisdiction to declare unconstitutional a limiting provision of the Act. Take for example the case presently before us: if the Commission must apply the Act as it is written, then the appellants cannot get their complaint before a tribunal, depending as it does on s. 15(c) being found to be inoperative. The same is true of any complaint that requires the Commission to arrive at a decision on a constitutional matter before being able to find that the complaint warrants further inquiry by a tribunal. It would be something of a paradox for Parliament to grant tribunals under the Act a jurisdiction that could never be exercised.20\n[29] However, I am of the view that this case, within the current legislative context and based on the state of the Supreme Court's recent cases, does not support the respondent's claims. Moreover, to properly understand the Cooper passage, we must also refer to the following paragraphs in which La Forest J. adds:\n64 As with the Commission there is [at that time] no explicit power given to a tribunal to consider questions of law. Taken together, ss. 50(1) and 53(2) of the Act state that a tribunal shall inquire into the complaint referred to it by the Commission to determine if it is substantiated. This is primarily and essentially a fact-finding inquiry with the aim of establishing whether or not a discriminatory practice occurred. In the course of such an inquiry a tribunal may indeed consider questions of law. As with the Commission, these questions will often centre around the interpretation of the enabling legislation. However, unlike the Commission, it is implicit in the scheme of the Act that a tribunal possesses a more general power to deal with questions of law. Thus tribunals have been recognized as having jurisdiction to interpret statutes other than the Act (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Druken, [1989] 2 F.C. 24 (C.A.)) and as having jurisdiction to consider constitutional questions other than those noted above. In particular, it is well accepted that a tribunal has the power to address questions on the constitutional division of powers (Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Qu'Appelle Indian Residential Council (1986), 7 C.H.R.R. D\/3600 (C.H.R.T.)), and on the validity of a ground of discrimination under the Act (Nealy v. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450 (C.H.R.T.)), and it is foreseeable that a tribunal could entertain Charter arguments on the constitutionality of available remedies in a particular case (see Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892). Even in such instances, however, the legal findings of a tribunal receive no deference from the courts. This position was firmly established by this Court in Mossop, supra, at p. 585:\nThe superior expertise of a human rights tribunal relates to fact-finding and adjudication in a human rights context. It does not extend to general questions of law such as the one at issue in this case. These are ultimately matters within the province of the judiciary, and involve concepts of statutory interpretation and general legal reasoning which the courts must be supposed competent to perform.\n65 I would add a practical note of caution with respect to a tribunal's jurisdiction to consider Charter arguments. First, as already noted, a tribunal does not have any special expertise except in the area of factual determinations in the human rights context. Second, any efficiencies that are prima facie gained by avoiding the court system will be lost when the inevitable judicial review proceeding is brought in the Federal Court. Third, the unfettered ability of a tribunal to accept any evidence it sees fit is well suited to a human rights complaint determination but is inappropriate when addressing the constitutionality of a legislative provision. Finally, and perhaps most decisively, the added complexity, cost, and time that would be involved when a tribunal is to hear a constitutional question would erode to a large degree the primary goal sought in creating the tribunals, i.e., the efficient and timely adjudication of human rights complaints.\n66 Taking all these factors into consideration, I am of that view that while a tribunal may have jurisdiction to consider general legal and constitutional questions, logic demands that it has no ability to question the constitutional validity of a limiting provision of the Act. (My underlining.)\n[30] In Cooper, the Court, in concluding that the Tribunal could not decide a question on the constitutionality of a provision in its enabling legislation, based itself on the fact that the Act in force at the time did not explicitly give the Tribunal the authority to consider and decide questions of law. It recognizes, however, that the scheme of the Act implicitly allowed the Tribunal to rule on general questions of law and constitutionality. In Nova Scotia (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Martin, the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the distinction between general and limited questions of law.21\n[31] Be that as it may, and with all deference to the position of the majority in Cooper, I have to focus now on the new legislative context and the Supreme Court's decision in Martin which proposes a new approach to answering the question raised in the current case.\n[32] Before analysing the Martin decision, I must clear up some confusion regarding the respective roles of the Commission and the Tribunal. The respondent mentioned in its argument that the Commission is essentially an administrative body and that it is specifically responsible for administering and ensuring compliance with the Act. The respondent based itself on the comments of La Forest J., who indicated in Cooper22 that:\nThe Commission is not an adjudicative body; that is the role of a tribunal appointed under the Act. When deciding whether a complaint should proceed to be inquired into by a tribunal, the Commission fulfils a screening analysis somewhat analogous to that of a judge at a preliminary inquiry. It is not the job of the Commission to determine if the complaint is made out. Rather its duty is to decide if, under the provisions of the Act, an inquiry is warranted having regard to all the facts. The central component of the Commission's role, then, is that of assessing the sufficiency of the evidence before it. Justice Sopinka emphasized this point in Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de production du Qu\u00e9bec et de L'Acadie v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 879, at p. 899.\n[33] This is the role and function of the Commission; those of the Tribunal are different.\n[34] Without going into the details of the roles of these two bodies, I want to state that in Bell Canada v. Canadian Telephone Employees Association23 the Supreme Court did indeed take on the role and character of the Tribunal:\n23 The main function of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is adjudicative. It conducts formal hearings into complaints that have been referred to it by the Commission. It has many of the powers of a court. It is empowered to find facts, to interpret and apply the law to the facts before it, and to award appropriate remedies. Moreover, its hearings have much the same structure as a formal trial before a court. The parties before the Tribunal lead evidence, call and cross-examine witnesses, and make submissions on how the law should be applied to the facts. The Tribunal is not involved in crafting policy, nor does it undertake its own independent investigations of complaints: the investigative and policy-making functions have deliberately been assigned by the legislature to a different body, the Commission. [...]\n26 [...] The Tribunal is part of a legislative scheme for identifying and remedying discrimination. As such, the larger purpose behind its adjudication is to ensure that governmental policy on discrimination is implemented. It is crucial, for this larger purpose, that any ambiguities in the Act be interpreted by the Tribunal in a manner that furthers, rather than frustrates, the Act's objectives. (My underlining)\n[35] The Tribunal is therefore an adjudicative body whose main function is deciding complaints referred by the Commission and interpreting the Act so as to achieve its objectives.\n[36] The Commission refers complaints to the Tribunal. In this case, all parties including the respondent agree that the Tribunal has indeed been referred a complaint from the Commission.\n[37] It is clear upon reading the letter from the Commission Chairperson to the Tribunal Chairperson that all aspects of the complaint, as they appear in the complaint form signed by the complainant in 2001, were referred to the Tribunal. Also, as my colleague, member Hadjis, so clearly pointed out in C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Attorney General of Canada one must not lose sight of the fact that although the Commission has the authority to decide whether a complaint is to be referred to the Tribunal (ss. 44(3) and 49 of the Act), the complaint continues to remain the complainant's, not the Commission's. 24\n[38] Once it receives a complaint, the Tribunal, in accordance with section 50(2) of the Act, which did not exist at the time of the Cooper decision, decide[s] all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter. (My underlining.) The federal legislator, knowing the Supreme Court's conclusions in Cooper, clearly elected to broaden the Tribunal's jurisdiction by adopting this provision in 1998. This decision is consistent with principal of supremacy of the Constitution as set out in section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and with the basic principle that an administrative tribunal which has been conferred the power to interpret law holds a concomitant power to determine whether that law is constitutionally valid25 or, in the words of the Supreme Court in Cooper if a tribunal does have the power to consider questions of law, then it follows by the operation of s. 52(1) [Constitution Act,1982], that it must be able to address constitutional issues, including the constitutional validity of its enabling statute 26. This conclusion is confirmed in Bell:\n[...]The Tribunal's power to decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter, under s. 50(2) of the Act, is clearly a general power to consider questions of law, including questions pertaining to the Charter and the Canadian Bill of Rights. 27\n[39] In Douglas College, Cuddy Chicks and T\u00e9treault-Gadoury, the Supreme Court also considered this issue, and in each case it pointed out valid reasons, from a principle and general policy perspective, for conferring such a power on administrative tribunals. These reasons are clearly set out in paragraphs 28 to 32 of the Martin decision.\n[40] Since the Tribunal has the power under section 50(2) to decide questions of law, then in the Supreme Court's words, it is presumed to have the concomitant power to consider and decide questions under the Charter, unless the legislator has withdrawn this power. Thus an administrative tribunal that has the power to decide questions of law arising under a particular legislative provision will be presumed to have the power to determine the constitutional validity of that provision. In other words, the power to decide a question of law is the power to decide by applying only valid laws.28 (My underlining.) Or, in the words of the Supreme Court in Bell, No invalid law binds the Tribunal.29\n[41] In Paul v. British Columbia (Forest Appeals Commission)30, the Supreme Court had to decide whether a province can confer on an administrative tribunal the power to hear and decide questions on aboriginal rights under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. In response to this, the Supreme Court said the following:\nAs a preliminary issue, I note that there is no basis for requiring an express empowerment that an administrative tribunal be able to apply s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. There is no persuasive basis for distinguishing the power to determine s. 35 questions from the power to determine other constitutional questions, such as the division of powers under the Constitution Act, 1867 or a right under the Charter. Section 35 is not, any more than the Charter, some holy grail which only judicial initiates may touch (Cooper, supra, at para. 70, per McLachlin J. (as she was then), dissenting). [...] The arguments that s. 35 rights are qualitatively different - that they are more complex, and require greater expertise in relation to the evidence adduced - have little merit. As Moen J. noted in Ermineskin Cree Nation v. Canada (2001), 297 A.R. 226, 2001 ABQB 760, at para. 51, in determining that a Human Rights Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider a s. 35 argument:\n[T]here is no principled basis for distinguishing Charter questions from s. 35 questions in the context of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to consider constitutional questions. In either case, the decision-maker is simply applying the tests set out in the case law to determine if the particular right claimed is protected by the Constitution. In either case, if the applicant is successful, the result is a declaration of invalidity or a refusal to apply only the particular statute or provision before the decision-maker.31(My underlining)\n[42] These comments also apply to the case before us. Interestingly enough, the Alberta trial court was rightly called upon, in Ermineskin Cree Nation v. Canada, cited in Paul, to rule on section 50(2) of the Act in the light of Cooper and it found that the power to decide questions of law gave the Tribunal the power to decide constitutional questions.\n[43] In its recent decision in Martin, the Supreme Court presented the new approach for determining if a tribunal, such as the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, may subject legislative provisions to Charter scrutiny. This approach can be summarized as follows:\nThe first question is whether the administrative tribunal has jurisdiction, explicit or implied, to decide questions of law arising under the challenged provision. a) Explicit jurisdiction must be found in the terms of the statutory grant of authority. b)Implied jurisdiction must be discerned by looking at the statute as a whole. Relevant factors will include the statutory mandate of the tribunal in issue and whether deciding questions of law is necessary to fulfilling this mandate effectively; the interaction of the tribunal in question with other elements of the administrative system; whether the tribunal is adjudicative in nature; and practical considerations, including the tribunal's capacity to consider questions of law. Practical considerations, however, cannot override a clear implication from the statute itself. If the tribunal is found to have jurisdiction to decide questions of law arising under a legislative provision, this power will be presumed to include jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of that provision under the Charter. The party alleging that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction to apply the Charter may rebut the presumption by a) pointing to an explicit withdrawal of authority to consider the Charter, or b) convincing the court that an examination of the statutory scheme clearly leads to the conclusion that the legislature intended to exclude the Charter from the questions of law to be addressed by the tribunal. Such an implication should generally arise from the statute itself, rather than from external considerations.32\n[44] In the case before us, the Tribunal's jurisdiction is explicitly provided for in section 50(2) of the Act. In the words of Gonthier J. in Martin if it is endowed with the power to consider questions of law relating to a provision, that power will normally extend to assessing the constitutional validity of that provision...the consistency of a provision with the Constitution is a question of law arising under that provision 33 Since the Tribunal has the power to decide questions of law relating to a legislative provision, this power is presumed to include the power to decide on the constitutional validity of that provision under the Charter.\n[45] It is true that in Martin, Gonthier J. indicated:\nIn my view, the result reached in Cooper could have been reached under the current restated rules, given La Forest J.'s finding that the Commission had no authority, either explicit or implicit, to decide questions of law arising under s. 15(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. It is thus unnecessary at this time to revisit the holding in that case [...] 34\n[46] Thus, the question of whether the Commission has such authority within the new legislative framework remains undecided. However, this question does not need to be answered in these proceedings because it is clear that the legislator explicitly gave this authority to the Tribunal.\n[47] The Honourable Justice Gonthier added:\nTo the extent that it is incompatible with the present reasons, however, I am of the view that the ratio of the majority judgment in Cooper is no longer good law. This is particularly true insofar as it implies that the distinction between general and limited questions of law is generally relevant to the analysis of an administrative tribunal's jurisdiction to apply the Charter, or that the adjudicative nature of the administrative body is a necessary (or even preponderant) factor in the search for implicit jurisdiction. Likewise, the opinions expressed by Lamer CJ in his concurrence are at odds with the current approach and should not be relied on.35\n[48] I am therefore of the view that, since the passage of the legislative amendments in 1998, the majority's conclusion in Cooper is no longer consistent, at least with respect to the Tribunal, with the Supreme Court's reasons in Martin.\n[49] Since the Tribunal is explicitly granted the authority to decide questions of law, it is now up to the respondent, according to the approach in Martin, to rebut this presumption either by pointing to an explicit withdrawal of this authority to consider the Charter, which is not the case here, or by convincing the Tribunal that an examination of the statutory scheme clearly leads to the conclusion that the legislature intended to exclude the Charter from questions of law to be addressed by the Tribunal. Such an implication should generally arise from the Act itself, rather than from external considerations.\n[50] Given the quasi-constitutional nature of the Act and its purpose to identify and remedy discrimination, it is crucial that the Act be interpreted by the Tribunal in a manner that furthers, rather than frustrates, the Act's objectives.36 The Act evinces the legislator's intent to establish a Tribunal that follows a quasi-judicial process and has functions that allow it to be interpreted in a non-discriminatory manner.\n[51] As a result of the foregoing, I am not satisfied that the responded has successfully met the burden of demonstrating that an examination of the statutory scheme clearly leads to the conclusion that the legislature intended to exclude the Charter from the questions of law to be addressed by the Tribunal or that it intended to exclude constitutionality questions regarding provisions in its enabling legislation.\n[52] I am also not satisfied with the argument that this intent to exclude the deciding of questions on the constitutional validity of a provision in the enabling legislation arises from section 49(5)37 of the Act. Upon reading section 49(6)38, it is clear that section 49(5) has only a procedural effect and that observing it in no way voids the proceedings.\nV. CONCLUSION [53] For the above reasons, I am dismissing the respondent's preliminary objection. My conclusions imply that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry into all aspects of the case, including the constitutional validity of paragraph 15(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act with respect to section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA,Ontario December 9, 2003\n1 R.S.

Hadjis\n2003 CHRT 46 2003\/10\/29\n[1] The Complainant wishes to call upon Dr. Harish C. Jain, Professor Emeritus, Human Resources and Labour Relations at the MGD School of Business of McMaster University, to testify in the present case as an expert. The Complainant proposes to qualify Prof. Jain as an expert in the field of systemic discrimination, discrimination in the large sense and racial prejudice in the workplace, from the perspective of a social scientist.\n[2] The Respondent has taken issue with Prof. Jain's proposed qualification for the purpose of this expert testimony. In addition, the Respondent questions the relevance and necessity of this proposed evidence.\n[3] The Respondent presented its objection after Prof. Jain had completed his testimony with regard solely to the matter of his qualification as an expert. On the consent of the parties, a copy of Prof. Jain's report detailing his intended evidence was provided to me to assist in my deliberations.\n[4] An analysis regarding the admissibility of expert evidence should be conducted in accordance with the leading decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on this subject, in the case of R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9. The Court pointed out that the admission of expert evidence depends upon the application of the following criteria:\nRelevance; Necessity in assisting the trier of fact; The absence of any exclusionary rule; A properly qualified expert.\n[5] Accordingly, the first two questions for me to consider are the following: Is the proposed evidence of Prof. Jain relevant, and if so, is it necessary in assisting the Tribunal?\n[6] On the question of relevance, the Court in Mohan noted the following, at paragraph 18:\nRelevance is a threshold requirement for the admission of expert evidence as with all other evidence. Relevance is a matter to be decided by a judge as question of law. Although prima facie admissible if so related to a fact in issue that it tends to establish it, that does not end the inquiry. This merely determines the logical relevance of the evidence. Other considerations enter into the decision as to admissibility. This further inquiry may be described as a cost benefit analysis, that is whether its value is worth what it costs. See McCormick on Evidence (3rd ed. 1984), at p. 544. Cost in this context is not used in its traditional economic sense but rather in terms of its impact on the trial process. Evidence that is otherwise logically relevant may be excluded on this basis, if its probative value is overborne by its prejudicial effect, if it involves an inordinate amount of time which is not commensurate with its value or if it is misleading in the sense that its effect on the trier of fact, particularly a jury, is out of proportion to its reliability.\n[7] On the issue of necessity, the Court in Mohan cites, at paragraph 21, from its prior decision in the case of R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24:\nWith respect to matters calling for special knowledge, an expert in the field may draw inferences and state his opinion. An expert's function is precisely this: to provide the judge and jury with a ready-made inference which the judge and jury, due to the technical nature of the facts, are unable to formulate. An expert's opinion is admissible to furnish the Court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury. If on the proven facts a judge or jury can form their own conclusions without help, then the opinion of the expert is unnecessary (Turner (1974), 60 Crim. App. R. 80, at p. 83, per Lawton L.J.)\n[8] The Supreme Court goes on to say, in Mohan, at paragraph 22:\nThis pre-condition is often expressed in terms as to whether the evidence would be helpful to the trier of fact. The word helpful is not quite appropriate and sets too low a standard. However, I would not judge necessity by too strict a standard. What is required is that the opinion be necessary in the sense that it provide information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury: as quoted by Dickson J. in R. v. Abbey, supra. As stated by Dickson J., the evidence must be necessary to enable the trier of fact to appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical nature.\n[emphasis added]\n[9] There are essentially two parts to the proposed evidence of Prof. Jain, as advanced in his report. The first is in the form of an introductory explanation of some of the causes of racial discrimination in the workplace. There is no explicit reference, within this aspect of the evidence, to the RCMP or to the specific facts alleged in the complaint.\n[10] The second portion of the proposed expert evidence is described as a quantitative analysis of the scope, nature and trends of racial discrimination in employment in Canada over the last two decades, based on a sample of 119 cases published by the Canadian Human Rights Reporter between 1980 and 1999. This is followed up with a qualitative analysis, based upon selected cases, with respect to patterns of behaviour and employment conditions that lead to discriminatory treatment of racial minorities in the workplace, that the witness points out is meant to be illustrative. These analyses are occasionally interspersed with comments by Prof. Jain to the effect that in his opinion, many of the incidents alleged in the complaint reflect some of the patterns of discrimination documented in Canadian human rights case law.\n[11] I find that the first part of the proposed evidence is of minimal probative value to this case. While knowledge of the root causes of racism in the workplace is vital to our society's ongoing quest to eradicate all forms of discrimination, I fail to see how general evidence relating thereto can be of assistance in determining whether the specific discriminatory conduct alleged in the complaint occurred in fact. The time to be expended to receive this evidence will not be commensurate with its probative value.\n[12] With respect to the second aspect of the proposed evidence, I have no doubt that a review of the relevant jurisprudence in the area of racial discrimination will be of assistance to me when it comes down to making my findings and issuing my decision, once all of the evidence of the Complainant and the Respondent will have been led. I fully expect each party's learned and able counsel to apprise me of all the relevant case law and other authorities, and to bring up any analogous facts on the basis of which I will be urged to reach similar findings and conclusions. Conducting this form of analysis falls squarely within the scope of the Tribunal's functions. The Supreme Court of Canada has observed on several occasions that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has a superior expertise as it relates to fact finding and adjudication in the human rights context. (See, for instance, R v. Mossop, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554).The Tribunal is thus able to draw the very inferences and conclusions that Prof. Jain has made in his report. I am not persuaded, therefore, that the second facet of his proposed evidence will fall outside the experience and knowledge of the Tribunal. The condition of necessity articulated in Mohan has not been satisfied.\n[13] For these reasons alone, the Respondent's objection is maintained and the proposed evidence of Prof. Jain is not admitted. The question of his qualifications for the purposes of his testimony in this case thus becomes moot and need not be explored.\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and accurate representation of my ruling given to the parties in the above-noted matter on October 29, 2003.

Hadjis\n[1] This ruling concerns the issue of whether the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) and the Complainant are obliged to disclose the minutes of settlement regarding two other human rights complaints.\n[2] The Complainant and the Respondent are both employed by Canada Post Corporation. In 1998, they were also members of the local executive of their union, the Union of Postal Communications Employees (UPCE), which is a component of the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC). The Complainant claims that Respondent sexually harassed her on an ongoing basis, during the course of his membership on the executive. As a result of this alleged harassment, the Complainant filed human rights complaints against the Respondent, the UPCE and the PSAC.\n[3] The complaints against the unions (Commission File Nos. H48451 & H48449) were settled in December 2002. The terms of the settlement have since been approved by the Commission, pursuant to s. 48 of the Act. A settlement was not, however, reached with the Respondent, and the hearing as to the merits of the complaint against him began on January 13, 2003. A second set of hearing dates is scheduled to commence on February 17, 2003.\n[4] The Respondent has taken issue with the fact that a copy of the minutes of settlement with the unions has not been disclosed to him. Although the Respondent is not represented by legal counsel and is acting on his own behalf, I understand him to be contending that he is entitled to have this document communicated to him, in accordance with Rule 6(3) of the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure. This rule, when read together with Rule 6(1)(d), obliges a party to provide to other parties, copies of all documents in its possession which are relevant to any matter in issue in the case and for which no privilege is claimed. The test for relevance for these purposes has been expressed as being whether the document in question is arguably relevant to the hearing.(1)\n[5] The Commission and the Complainant are unwilling to disclose the minutes of settlement. Instead, the Commission has informed the Respondent in writing of what the Commission identifies as a general recounting of the terms of the settlement. This summary consists of four paragraphs that are set out in point form. It purportedly reflects all the essential terms of the agreement (minus the technical language), with one significant exception: the specific monetary amounts that the unions undertook to pay the Complainant have been excluded. Together with the summary, the Respondent was provided with a copy of the letter of apology from the unions to the Complainant, which was drafted in accordance with the terms of the agreement. According to Commission counsel, a single document was drafted to reflect the settlement of both complaints. The minutes of settlement contain a clause by which the parties agree to keep the terms of the agreement confidential.\n[6] The Respondent is not satisfied with this level of disclosure and has specifically requested communication of the amounts paid by the unions to the Complainant. I should point out that I have not viewed the minutes of settlement in question.\n[7] Considering the fact that the unions, who are not parties before the Tribunal in this case, were signatories to the agreement, I felt it appropriate to request their opinions with respect to this disclosure issue. Their joint position was expressed in a letter from Mr. Craig Spencer, Legal Counsel, PSAC Membership Programs Branch. The unions concur with the Complainant and the Commission that the Minutes of Settlement should not be disclosed in their entirety. The objections of the Commission and the Complainant are seemingly limited to the disclosure of the actual financial settlement amounts. They are amenable to the communication of the remainder of the minutes of settlement.\nI. IS THE DOCUMENT RELEVANT TO A MATTER IN ISSUE IN THE CASE? [8] The unions submit, with the apparent concurrence of the Commission and the Complainant, that the matters in issue in the settled complaints are completely unrelated and irrelevant to the matters in issue in the complaint against the Respondent. The latter complaint alleges specific actions in violation of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act) by the Respondent. The complaints against the unions, on the other hand, although triggered by the alleged actions of the Respondent, are distinct in that they deal specifically with the administrative framework developed by the PSAC and the UPCE to review complaints of harassment in the context of union activity. As is evident from the text of the complaints against the unions, the Complainant believes that the system for dealing with harassment issues that was in place within the unions failed to deliver to her a timely review of her concerns.\n[9] Indeed, a significant portion of both complaints against these labour organizations is focussed on the manner in which senior union representatives had mismanaged her complaints to them regarding the Respondent's conduct. In the human rights complaint filed with the Commission against the Respondent, a contravention of s. 14 of the Act is alleged only. This provision makes it a discriminatory act to harass a person based on a prohibited ground, including sex. With respect to the complaints filed against the union, however, violations of s. 7, s. 9 as well as s. 14 are alleged. Under s. 7, it is a discriminatory practice to differentiate adversely in the course of a person's employment and, of greater significance, pursuant to s. 9, it is a discriminatory practice for an employee organization to exclude, expel or suspend a member of the organization on a prohibited ground, such as sex. Thus, the liability that the Commission sought to attach to the unions was based, at least in part, on the manner in which they treated their member, as a consequence of her allegations that another union executive member had sexually harassed her.\n[10] The unions argue that they could have been found liable, irrespective of the outcome of the complaint against the Respondent. The unions' counsel suggested that if the Tribunal were to find that the Respondent had not harassed the Complainant, the unions would not seek to reopen or seek to invalidate the settlement.\n[11] It is pointed out that the only significant portions of the settlement terms that are being withheld are the settlement amounts. In light of the discrete liabilities of the unions on the one hand and the Respondent on the other, the sums paid to the Complainant by the unions are of no relevance to the amounts that she is claiming from the Respondent. The Commission notes that according to the summary of the minutes of settlement referred to above, compensation was to be paid by the unions to the Complainant to address the Complainant's pain and suffering pursuant to s. 53(2)(e) of the Act only. No payment was made in respect of lost wages (that is, honoraria to which union executives were entitled) or expenses. Turning to the present case, the Commission's and Complainant's Joint Letter of Particulars indicates that financial compensation for the Complainant's expenses is being claimed against the Respondent, as well as an award for pain and suffering, pursuant to s. 53(2)(e).\n[12] Thus, compensation for pain and suffering was claimed against the Respondent as well as the unions. The Commission argues that these remedies are nonetheless unrelated. The Complainant was entitled to claim up to the maximum amount allowable for pain and suffering under the Act ($20,000.00) against each of the original respondents. Commission counsel directed me to the findings in Ghosh v. Domglas Inc. (No. 2),(2) with respect to the remedial provision in the Ontario Human Rights Code that authorizes a Board of Inquiry to order an award of up to $10,000 as monetary compensation for mental anguish. The Board stated that:\nWhile the Code limits the amount of an award of monetary compensation in respect of mental anguish, it does not restrict the number of such awards a board may order after a hearing where it finds distinct rights to have been infringed in separate incidents, or series of incidents, and whether by the same or by different respondents.(3)\nA similar finding was reached in the more recent Ontario Board of Inquiry decision in Moffat v. Kinark Child and Family Services.(4)\n[13] The Commission contends that the same reasoning can be extended to the remedial provisions under the Act, including s. 50(2)(e). If the remedies for pain and suffering are distinct, from one complaint to another, the sums received by the Complainant from the unions cannot be set off against those that she is claiming from the Respondent. Therefore, the amounts that the Complainant may have received from the other respondents are of no relevance to the claim for pain and suffering that she has addressed against the Respondent in the present case.\n[14] This argument assumes that the Tribunal will be in a position to distinguish the pain and suffering that the Complainant experienced at the hands of the Respondent from the pain and suffering arising from the unions' conduct. It is possible that the Tribunal will be unable to make such a determination. The three human rights complaints and the Joint Letter of Particulars all suggest that a significant portion of the unions' actions and omissions occurred at the same time as the Respondent was purportedly harassing the Complainant. In the event that I sustain the complaint against the Respondent and find that the Complainant experienced pain and suffering over the period in question, it is certainly possible that I will be unable to separate out the injury caused by the Respondent's conduct from that of the unions. In this event, the Respondent could argue that he should not be ordered to compensate the Complainant for all her pain and suffering. At least for the purpose of avoiding a double indemnification of the Complainant, knowledge of whatever amounts she may have received from the unions is relevant to a matter in issue in the Respondent's case. On this basis alone, I find that the settlement document is arguably relevant.\n[15] But is the liability of the unions really as distinct as it has been made out to be? It is true that the complaints against the labour organizations refer to s. 7 and s. 9 of the Act and mention the specific conduct of the unions and their representatives. However, according to the Commission's and Complainant's Joint Letter of Particulars, which was prepared before the complaints against the unions were settled, the issues of the case include the following:\nDid the Respondents UPCE and PSAC fail to exercise due diligence in preventing the acts of harassment from occurring or mitigate the effect of the harassment on the Complainant, per section 65 of the Act?\nS. 65(1) is the provision of the Act in virtue of which acts or omissions committed by officers, directors, employees or agents of an organization are deemed to be acts or omissions committed by the organization - in other words, deemed or vicarious liability. Under s. 65(2), the organization may exculpate itself by demonstrating that it did not consent to those acts or omissions, it exercised all due diligence to prevent them and it tried subsequently to mitigate their effects.\n[16] As is implied by the Complainant's and the Commission's reference to s. 65, the liability of the unions could flow from the principal liability of the alleged harasser, the Respondent. In these circumstances, organizations may be condemned jointly and severally with their officers, directors, employees or agents, to compensate complainants. As was explained in Moffat:\nIn those decisions, where the corporate respondent is found to be liable for the discriminatory conduct of a personal respondent, the order holds the corporate respondent jointly and severally liable with the individual for the award in respect of that conduct.(5)\nThe Board of Inquiry in Moffat went on to note that a finding of deemed or vicarious liability does not support a further separate award in respect of that liability.(6)\n[17] Accordingly, it could certainly be argued that the liability alleged against the unions flows vicariously from the liability of the Respondent, and that the Complainant's damage claim against him should be reduced by the sums received in settlement of her complaints against the unions. The settlement amounts thus become relevant the Respondent's case.\n[18] For all these reasons, I am satisfied that the minutes of settlement are relevant to a matter in issue in the case, namely, the determination of the amount of the award that the Respondent may be ordered to pay if he is found liable.\nII. IS THE DOCUMENT PRIVILEGED? [19] In his written submissions, counsel for the unions noted that in practice, parties to settlement negotiations undertake to maintain strict confidentiality as a motivation to parties to reconcile their differences and avoid litigation. Any societal interest in the terms of the agreement is protected through the process of review and approval by the Commission that must be completed before the settlement becomes enforceable, pursuant to s. 48 of the Act.\n[20] Indeed, in furtherance of this objective, courts have protected from disclosure communications made with a view to reconciliation or settlement.(7) However, as explained by Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, if negotiations are successful and result in a consensual agreement, the communications may be tendered in proof of the settlement, where the existence or interpretation of the agreement is itself in issue.(8) I note that the authors' discussion regarding this privilege appears to revolve around the communications leading up to the settlement, not the settlement document itself. By implication, I take it that minutes of settlement would not be subject to the privilege. At any rate, I am satisfied that the questions regarding the assessment of damages for pain and suffering are issues that relate to the interpretation of the settlement agreement itself. I am therefore not persuaded that a privilege extends to the minutes of settlement.\nIII. CONCLUSION AND ORDER [21] I order the Commission and the Complaint to disclose to the Respondent, by 4:00 PM, on Thursday, February 13, 2003, the minutes of the settlement with the PSAC and the UPCE. This disclosure shall be in the form of copies of the document, in accordance with Rule 6(3) of the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure.\n[22] In order to address some of the concerns as to the confidentiality of the documents, I order the disclosure of the document on the following conditions:\nThe Respondent shall only consult the document for the purposes of the hearing; The Respondent shall not disclose the document nor its content to anyone, other than his legal counsel, if any; The Respondent shall not make any additional copies of the disclosed document and shall return it to the Commission within one week after the close of the hearing in this case.\n[23] Any similar concerns regarding the admission of the document into evidence during the hearing can be addressed at that time, perhaps through a motion for in camera proceedings.\nOriginal signed by\nAthanasios D.

Mactavish\n[1] Richard Warman has filed a human rights complaint against Fred Kyburz, alleging that Mr. Kyburz was discriminating against people on the basis of religion, race and national or ethnic origin by communicating messages over his Internet web-site. Mr. Warman alleges that these messages expose non-Christians, non-Caucasians and individuals of other races, religions and national or ethnic origins to hatred and\/or contempt, contrary to the provisions of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission and Mr. Warman have now brought a motion to amend the complaint to include an allegation of retaliation, pursuant to section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The moving parties allege that subsequent to the filing of Mr. Warman's complaint, Mr. Warman was harassed and threatened on numerous occasions by way of material published on the Internet by Mr. Kyburz.\n[3] The Commission's Statement of Particulars disclosed the Commission's intention to seek an amendment to the complaint to deal with the issue of retaliation. The Statement of Particulars was evidently served on Mr. Kyburz on January 29, 2003. Further, a separate complaint dealing with the issue of retaliation was evidently filed with the Commission in October of 2002. The Commission says that Mr. Kyburz would have been made aware of the facts in issue in the retaliation complaint, although it is unclear from the material before me when this would have occurred.\n[4] Mr. Kyburz has not responded to the Commission's motion within the time set by the Tribunal.\n[5] A human rights complaint is not like a criminal indictment. There is discretion in the Tribunal to amend a complaint to deal with additional allegations, provided that sufficient notice is given to the respondent so as to enable him to properly defend himself.(1) The hearing in this case is scheduled to commence on March 17, 2003. Mr. Kyburz will have been aware for at least a month and a half before the start of the hearing that an allegation of retaliation was in issue in this case. There is nothing before me to indicate that Mr. Kyburz would be prejudiced in any way in the preparation of his defense if leave to amend Mr. Warman's complaint is granted.\n[6] Leave is hereby granted to the Canadian Human Rights Commission and to Mr. Warman to amend Mr. Warman's complaint to include the allegation of retaliation pursuant to Section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Commission and Mr. Warman shall have 10 days in which to serve and file an amended complaint form, together with an amended statement of issues and any necessary supplementary disclosure.\nOriginal signed by\nAnne L.

Counsel for the Respondent has agreed to accept the delivery of a number of subpoenas that have been issued to the Complainant, but has requested conduct money. The Complainant has accordingly asked me to stipulate the necessary fees.\n[2] The matter is dealt with in section 50(6) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which states that any person summoned to attend a hearing is entitled in the discretion of the member or panel to receive the same fees and allowances as those paid to persons summoned to attend before the Federal Court. I note that a witness is entitled to these fees and allowances: although the subsection gives me a discretion in the matter, I think that the fees and allowances should be paid unless there are compelling reasons to depart from normal practice. Testifying at a hearing is an inconvenient and often troublesome duty, which requires witnesses to rearrange their private lives in order to accommodate the interests of society. I am firmly of the view that they should be compensated for their trouble. The process of applying for subpoenas and paying these fees may also discourage the parties from calling unnecessary witnesses.\n[3] The practice in the Federal Court is governed by rules 42 and 43 of the Federal Court Rules, which state that a witness is entitled to the fees and travel expenses set out in Tariff A. Section 3 of the Tariff states that witness fees should be paid in the amount of $20 per day plus reasonable travel expenses, or the amount permitted in similar circumstances in the superior court of the province where the witness appears, whichever is greater. I am not aware of any rulings by the Tribunal, but I think the discretionary element in section 50(6) of the Canadian Human Rights Act allows me to vary these amounts in accordance with the circumstances of the case. The fees should not be so high that they interfere with the Complainant's right to present her case.\n[4] I accordingly believe that I have the authority to set a one time fee of $25 for ordinary witnesses within the City of Victoria, inclusive of travel expenses. This is conduct money and is to be provided to the witnesses when they receive their subpoenas. The witnesses have no obligation to appear if they do not receive the money.\n[5] I realize that these fees may be seen more as a notional form of payment than anything else. I nevertheless think they serve a symbolic purpose in recognizing the central place of witnesses in the system of justice. If individual witnesses are required to attend the hearing over an extended period of time, the matter can be revisited.\nOriginal signed by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nFebruary 13, 2003\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE NOS.: T627\/1501 and T628\/1601\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Amanda Day v.

Hadjis\n[1] The Complainant has a disability that obliges her to use a wheelchair. She alleges that the Respondent's bank branches near her home are inaccessible by wheelchair and that she has therefore been discriminated against, contrary to s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act).\n[2] The Respondent has filed a preliminary motion seeking the dismissal of the complaint. The Respondent contends that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to inquire into the complaint for lack of institutional impartiality and independence.\n[3] The Respondent takes the position that it has the right, as declared in s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights(1) not to be deprived of a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. This right, it is argued, is effectively a constitutional standard that extends to all Canadian tribunals and not merely to superior courts of inherent jurisdiction.(2) The Respondent contends that the function and structure of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, as articulated in the Act, vary little from that which is associated with courts.\n[4] The Respondent further suggests that the Act is an instrument through which the equality rights provided for in s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter) have been preserved. As such, the Tribunal's jurisdiction to deal with human rights under the Act serves as an extension to the protection of constitutional rights that is guaranteed under the Charter. The Tribunal's proceedings must therefore be conducted in accordance with the highest standards of institutional independence and impartiality.\n[5] The Respondent acknowledges that in Ocean Port Hotel v. British Columbia, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that while some administrative tribunals may be required to make quasi-judicial decisions, the degree of independence that is called for of a particular tribunal is a matter of discerning the intention of Parliament or the legislature and, absent constitutional constraints, this choice must be respected. (3) The Respondent adds, however, that the Tribunal's function and role within the realm of rights that are themselves derived from the Charter, impose precisely the type of constitutional constraints referred to in Ocean Port. Thus, in assessing the degree of independence required of the Tribunal, one should not merely defer to the intention of the legislator. Instead, the Tribunal should be adjudged against the same constitutional standard that is applied to superior courts. This constitutional imperative has already been extended to provincial courts.(4)\n[6] The Respondent argues that when assessed against this standard, at least two elements within the legislative framework of the Act bring into question the independence and impartiality of the Tribunal. The first concern relates to the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission), by virtue of s. 27 of the Act, to issue binding guidelines setting out the extent to which and the manner in which, in its opinion, any provision of the Act applies in a class of cases. The Respondent points out that the Commission's mandate under the Act is to represent the public interest on matters relating to equality, a duty that is ultimately incumbent upon the State. As such, the authority to pass the guidelines effectively empowers the State, that is to say, an arm of the executive branch, to appear before and, at the same time, instruct the Tribunal with respect to the interpretation of an act of the legislative branch. The binding nature of these guidelines would have the effect of compelling the Tribunal to abdicate its role as interpreter of the Act's provisions.\n[7] The second issue raised by the Respondent relates to the provisions of s. 48.2(2) of the Act that render a Tribunal member's ability to conclude an inquiry after his or her appointment expires conditional upon the approval of the Chairperson. In effect, contends the Respondent, a Tribunal member's security of tenure is subject to the Chairperson's discretion. The Respondent argues that in the face of such a discretionary power, it is illusory to expect the Tribunal to be reasonably perceived as possessing the necessary institutional independence.\n[8] For these reasons, the Respondent submits that a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias exists and that the Tribunal should therefore decline to conduct an inquiry into the complaint.\n[9] The Commission is of the view that it need not directly reply to the arguments raised by the Respondent regarding the Tribunal's institutional independence and impartiality. The Commission submits that the Federal Court of Appeal adjudicated these very questions, in Bell Canada v. Canada (Human Rights Commission),(5) a case that relates to a wage discrimination complaint that was filed against Bell Canada, and which the Commission eventually referred to the Tribunal for inquiry.\n[10] Bell Canada argued before the Court that due to the institutional bias and lack of independence of the Tribunal, its right to natural justice was being denied. Bell Canada specifically called into question the same sections of the Act that the Respondent has referred to in its submissions (s. 27(2) and s. 48.2(2)). The Federal Court of Appeal ruled, however, that a reasonable apprehension of bias does not arise with regard to either of these provisions. Bell Canada appealed from this judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada. Oral arguments on the appeal were presented just a few weeks ago, on January 23, 2003. A decision from the Court is not expected for several months to come.\n[11] The Commission contends that the Tribunal remains bound by the Federal Court of Appeal decision with respect to these issues, irrespective of the pending appeal. Obviously, this is not a matter of res judicata or chose jug\u00e9e, if only because the parties to the Bell Canada case and the present one are not the same. Yet, by virtue of the principle of stare decisis, a precedent or decision of a court is binding on courts and tribunals that are lower in the judicial hierarchy.(6) I am satisfied that the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Bell Canada concerns the identical statutory provisions as are under consideration before me and that essentially the same legal issues are discussed regarding these provisions.\n[12] Counsel for the Respondent suggested, nonetheless, that I am not necessarily bound by the determination of the Federal Court of Appeal. This judgment was rendered prior to the release of the decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in Mackin v. New Brunswick (Ministry of Finance).(7) It is therefore suggested that the Federal Court of Appeal reached its findings without the benefit of this more recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court regarding the issue of institutional independence and impartiality.\n[13] The Mackin case dealt with legislation that abolished the system of supernumerary judges that had been in place at the Provincial Court of New Brunswick, and replaced it with a panel of retired judges who were paid on a per diem basis. The Court held that the manner in which this law imposed change on the conditions of remuneration of judges affected their financial security and constituted a violation of the institutional guarantees of judicial independence contained in s. 11(d) of the Charter. The statute was declared unconstitutional.\n[14] In setting out the law regarding judicial independence and impartiality, the Supreme Court, in Mackin, relied on principles articulated in decisions that pre-dated the Federal Court of Appeal judgment in Bell Canada, namely Valente v. R.(8) and Re: Provincial Court Judges(9). Respondent counsel did not explain how Mackin's discussion on the law would have further enlightened the Federal Court of Appeal. It is also worth mentioning that the Supreme Court focussed its attention on the judicial independence and impartiality of courts, not administrative tribunals. Moreover, the Court's conclusions regarding the issue of security of tenure are of questionable assistance to the Respondent's submissions in the present case. The Supreme Court determined in Mackin that the abolition of the supernumerary system did not affect the Provincial Court judges' security of tenure. For all these reasons, I am not persuaded that the subsequent release of the Supreme Court decision in Mackin affects the impact of the findings in Bell Canada on the issues before me.\n[15] Counsel for the Respondent suggests that there is no reference in the Bell Canada decision to the relationship between s.15 of the Charter and the Act. Evidence was not introduced before me to indicate which arguments may or may not have been led before the Court. In any event, I do not believe that this facet of the Respondent's submissions adds significantly to its arguments overall. One cannot lose sight of the fact that at the core of the Respondent's submissions is its assertion that the Commission's guideline power, under s. 27(2) of the Act, and the Chairperson's discretionary authority pursuant to s. 48.2(2), create a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias. The Federal Court of Appeal turned its mind to these specific points and decided that the Tribunal's institutional independence and impartiality are not undermined thereby.\n[16] It is entirely possible that the Federal Court of Appeal considered the constitutional implications, if any, related to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, in reaching its findings. It would be highly presumptuous of me to attempt to distance myself from the conclusions of a Federal Court of Appeal judgment that deals directly with the specific questions before me, merely because no mention is made therein of a certain legal argument, especially where I have no evidence to suggest that this issue was not in fact raised by counsel in their submissions to the Court.\n[17] Furthermore, I do not accept the suggestion that I am free to ignore the findings of the Federal Court of Appeal simply because the matter is now in front of the Supreme Court of Canada. In Hujdic v. Air Canada,(10) a motion was presented by Air Canada asserting that a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias existed with respect to the Tribunal. The motion was filed after the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Bell Canada. The Chairperson stated, in her ruling on the motion:\nIn my view, the fact that Bell Canada is seeking leave to appeal the recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal is irrelevant. At this point, the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal is a valid judicial pronouncement, and represents the state of the law.(11)\n[18] The Tribunal's ruling in Hujdic was issued prior to the Supreme Court's decision to grant Bell Canada leave to appeal the judgment. I am not convinced that it makes any difference that the appeal has now been heard by the Supreme Court and taken under advisement. The judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal continues to represent the state of the law until that Court or the Supreme Court declares otherwise.\n[19] The Respondent's motion is therefore dismissed.\nCOSTS [20] Commission counsel argued that, considering the binding nature of the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Bell Canada, the Respondent's motion was entirely without merit and consequently, the Commission should be awarded costs. The Commission alleges that considerable public resources and costs were expended to prepare for, travel to and attend at the motion. Commission counsel acknowledged that there is no mention of a specific power to award costs in favour of the Commission in any provision of the Act. She contends, however, that in the absence of an express prohibition of the awarding of such costs, the Tribunal may make such an order as master of its own proceedings.\n[21] I am not convinced that the Respondent's conduct with respect to the filing of this motion was as egregious as the Commission suggests. The Tribunal generally affords all parties the opportunity to raise any preliminary matters, and where appropriate, these issues are dealt with well before the start of the hearing as to the merits of the complaint. I am satisfied that the Respondent was within its rights in presenting this motion. At the very least, raising its concern regarding the reasonable apprehension of bias in this manner provided the Respondent with some assurance that if the Supreme Court of Canada reverses the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Bell Canada, the Respondent will not be deemed to have waived its right to bring this question forward again.(12)\n[22] I leave for another day the issue of whether, in any case, the Tribunal has the authority to award costs to the Commission.\nORDER [23] The Respondent's motion is dismissed.

ORDER\nI. INTRODUCTION A. The Complaints [1] I have two complaints before me. The first alleges that Canadian Airlines International Ltd. discriminated against Yul F. Hill on the basis of race under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by failing to provide him with technical on the job training, by undermining his work, by denying him a promotion, and by monitoring him more closely than other employees. The discrimination is alleged to have occurred from June 1992 to the time of the hearing, though it began prior to that date. The second complaint alleges that Canadian failed to provide Mr. Hill with a harassment free workplace under section 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The harassment is alleged to have occurred between January 1991 and October 1994, and consisted of racial graffiti, jokes and slurs.\n[2] These complaints are personal rather than systemic. There was apparently a third complaint that dealt with larger issues in the workplace which was not referred to the Tribunal. The Complainant and the Commission nevertheless presented their case on the basis that there was a larger pattern of discrimination in the workplace. This is problematic, since there is no clear nexus between Mr. Hill's experiences and the general situation in the engine shop.\n[3] As the successor to Canadian Airlines International Ltd., Air Canada accepted any liability that Canadian might have incurred under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The hearing into the complaints took place in Vancouver and lasted 25 days. There were 18 witnesses. I received oral and written submissions at the end of the hearing, which have been of considerable assistance. Although Mr. Ash and Mr. Fakirani, who acted for the Complainant and Commission, made a valiant attempt to sustain the complaint, the facts are simply against them.\n[4] The Complainant and the Canadian Human Rights Commission took the position that he had been treated unfavourably because he was black. He was discriminated against by his foreman and was harassed by his foreman and other mechanics. The situation came to a tempestuous climax in the supervisors' office, when it erupted in an ugly and emotional exchange between Mr. Hill and his foreman on October 18, 1994. This incident led Mr. Hill to leave the workplace, for his own well-being.\n[5] Air Canada took the position that Mr. Hill was a problem employee, who avoided work and displayed a conscious lack of respect for authority.\n[6] The Respondent portrayed the Complainant as a person who was quick to blame his difficulties on race. In its written argument, it submitted:\nWhile the Complainant may have been treated differently than some of the other mechanics on the dash-80 with respect to job assignments, this had nothing to do with his race and everything to do with his abilities and attitude as a Mechanic.\nAnd again:\nWhile the Complainant may have been monitored more closely than other employees, this was not because of his race, color, national or ethnic origin, but rather because he had a tendency to absent himself from his workstation more frequently than other employees . . .\nThe Respondent submits that the Complainant blamed other people for his problems. Rather than amend his work habits, or apply for advancement in the normal manner, he fell into the trap of assuming that those around him were treating him unfairly.\nB. Preliminary Issues [7] I took a view of the engine shop during the hearing, which has been dealt with in a separate ruling. In the present context, it is enough to say that the view was of considerable assistance in understanding the rest of the evidence. Although there were changes in the layout of the shop, the general scheme of the buildings remained as it was when Mr. Hill worked at Canadian. The offices for the supervisors and foremen had not changed and the work was organized in a similar fashion. The view gave me a better sense of the protocols that were followed in assembling the engines, clarified the nature of the work that was done in different areas, and gave me a sense of the overall dimensions of the work environment. It reinforced the idea that the engine shop was run in a capable way and may have implicitly supported the evidence of various witnesses, but is not a major consideration in my findings of fact.\n[8] There is another legal issue, however, that should be addressed before dealing directly with the facts. One of the major difficulties in hearing the present case is that most of the testimony at the hearing dealt with events that occurred in the early 1990s. There were various estimates as to the number of people who worked in the engine shop, but the reality is that I heard from a relatively small number of witnesses, whose evidence was often vague and impressionistic. It would be difficult to gauge the emotional environment in a busy shop, so long after the fact, in any circumstances. It is much more difficult in the present case, where the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, the work environment was rife with uncertainty, and the situation was anything but normal.\n[9] There were nevertheless a number of internal reports on the events before me. I was impressed with the tone of these reports, which show considerable impartiality and tact in dealing with a difficult situation. Although the statements made to the authors of these reports were generally given in a more informal venue, without oath, and were not subject to searching examination, they have a freshness that adds to their significance in determining what occurred on the shop floor. Although I received additional evidence, which clarified some of the issues, I think that these reports should generally be accepted.\n[10] The evidence as a whole supports the early accounts of what happened. I think it makes sense to pay particular attention to the statements that were made before the participants had the opportunity to tailor their recitals to the needs of the case. This comes with certain qualifications. On the one hand, one should be careful not to read the reports too literally, since the notes made by the investigators were not verbatim. On the other hand, it is clear that the individuals interviewed by Laurie Ferguson and Hunter Rogers expressed themselves more freely than in the hearing.\nII. FACTS A. Credibility (i) The Complainant [11] I accept that the Complainant was presenting the facts as he saw them. This does not mean that I accept his account of what occurred. Mr. Hill was a partial witness, whose feelings often obscured his view of the facts. He had a tendency to reduce everything to a common denominator: that denominator was that he had not been treated fairly. The testimony of other witnesses, like Mr. Fletcher, supports this conclusion.\n[12] I think the differences between the parties lies more in the interpretation of facts than anything else. I nevertheless found that Mr. Hill's behaviour in the hearing room was inherently aggressive. I understand his feelings of injustice, but he was clearly inaccurate or mistaken on a number of counts and was unwilling to recognize that there was a case on the other side. It will become evident that I have rejected some of his testimony.\n[13] I accept the evidence of Doctor Pinkhasik, which established that Mr. Hill suffered from depression and anxiety. This does not in itself substantiate the complaints. There were a number of oblique references to other issues in the Complainant's life, which may have explained his psychological troubles.\n[14] A number of witnesses also gave evidence that would support the employer's allegation that Mr. Hill was looking for a cash settlement in filing the complaints. I think Mr. Hill's comments to other mechanics in this regard were more a form of psychological bravado than anything else, however, and I think the situation is more complicated than this suggests. It would be wrong to question the sincerity of Mr. Hill's feelings that he had been unfairly treated.\n(ii) Mr. Ryan [15] I also feel obliged to comment on the testimony of Mr. Ryan, Mr. Hill's foreman, whose credibility was put in issue by some of the witnesses. There was reference, for example, to the two faces of Ryan. Much of the present case is a story of the relations between Mr. Hill and Mr. Ryan. There is no doubt, in my mind, that Mr. Ryan had real enmity towards Mr. Hill. Mr. Kirby believed that Mr. Ryan intentionally provoked Mr. Hill, in a calculating and underhanded manner. I am not so sure of this, but the racial language that he appears to have used in speaking to Laurie Ferguson and Hunter Rogers strikes me as a more accurate reflection of the language used in the shop than the testimony at the hearing.\n[16] I am nevertheless of the view that Mr. Ryan disliked Mr. Hill because he was a difficult and temperamental employee. Mr. Hill had ambitions, but he was unwilling to do more than an average mechanic and felt that most of his duties were beneath him. I do not believe that the issue between the two men was race. The real issue was that Mr. Hill did not accept his foreman's authority over him. Mr. Ryan was also resentful, in my view, of the fact that Mr. Hill had complained about him. Mr. Ryan was careful not to offend those in authority and must have seen this as an attempt to subvert his authority.\n[17] There seems to have been a war of wills between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Hill. Whatever his personal faults, Mr. Ryan had a certain professional pride and was committed to the work in the shop. Mr. Hill, on the other hand, was determined to assert his independence. I have no desire to take part in the contest between the two men, but they clearly made it a point of honour to take exception to each other. There is no doubt that Mr. Hill, at least, was trying to get at Mr. Ryan.\n[18] Mr. Hill had a talent for irking those with immediate authority over him, which he seems to have perfected while working in the engine shop. He was far more careful with those who were higher in the hierarchy. There was at least one incident on the line, where Mr. Hill and Mr. Ryan must have exchanged rather dangerous looks, with Mr. Hill getting the better of Mr. Ryan's emotions. This incident occurred when Mr. Hill was given a new service bulletin and asked to redo work that he had already completed.\n[19] I have placed considerable reliance on the testimony of Margery Knorr, the equity officer, and Mr. Shelford, the director of the power plant. Both of these witnesses responded to questions from both sides in a thoughtful measured way. They were well informed and provided valuable evidence on company policy. I found their testimony to be eminently fair. I was also impressed with the evidence of Scott Hunter, who was impartial, precise and factual. Mr. Hunter was a member of the selection committee for the Planner III position and I accept his evidence in all respects.\n[20] I found the testimony of most of the other witnesses credible. I think Mr. Kirby would agree that he had an ideological position, which was reflected in his testimony. He was nevertheless candid and well spoken. The other mechanics who testified were sincere and cooperative. The evidence of Mr. Ghuman, a member of a minority, was candid and factual. The evidence of Mr. Cavasin was helpful, but revealed a good deal about the attitudes on the shop floor. Much of the evidence of racial tensions at Canadian had little bearing, however, on the situation in which Mr. Hill found himself. The testimony of Mr. Hibbert, who felt he was discriminated against, is a case in point.\nB. The Setting [21] The background to the present complaints is straightforward. Canadian was one of Canada's major commercial airlines. As a major airline, it had a maintenance and engineering department, which operated a machine shop in Vancouver. This is where most of the relevant events occurred. The evidence established that the airline was in desperate financial straits during the period covered by the complaints. No one knew whether the airline would survive and employees were in a state of constant emotional and financial pressure.\n(i) The Complainant [22] Mr. Hill began his career as a jet engine technician in the U.S. Navy, where he spent six years on active and reserve duty. He was employed by Canadian in 1986 as an apprentice mechanic and worked for Canadian for about eight years. He later became a full mechanic. As an Aircraft Mechanic, he was a member of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, known as the I.A.M. As is often the case, the allegations before me have been the subject of the grievance process under the relevant collective agreements, as well as an internal human rights investigation.\n[23] During his apprenticeship, the Complainant worked in maintenance and engineering. As a journeyman, he worked on the 737 line in the hangar. He was assigned to the engine shop from October of 1989 to December of 1990, and then returned to the 737 line. While Mr. Hill was in the engine shop, he worked on one of the crews on the Dash-80 line. He transferred back to the engine shop in June of 1992 and stayed there until May of 1994, when he was temporarily assigned to the wheel and brake shop. He returned to the Dash-80 line in August and stayed there until his last day of work, which was October 18, 1994. He was nevertheless paid until January of 1995.\n[24] Canadian had a company-wide mechanics' license issued by the Ministry of Transportation. As a result, the mechanics working for Canadian did not need individual licenses. Instead, mechanics were required to obtain an Aircraft Certification Authority, known as an ACA, to work on a particular engine. Mr. Hill had a company endorsement for the CF6-50 and CF6-80 engines. Mechanics could also obtain individual Ministry of Transportation licenses, known as M licenses for different aircraft and engines. There was considerable disagreement between the parties as to whether there was any significance in the fact that Mr. Hill had such a licence, since it was not required. Although I do not believe that anything turns on this, it certainly demonstrates that Mr. Hill was a man with ambitions who wanted more credentials than many of the mechanics at Canadian.\n(ii) The Dash-80 Line [25] The maintenance and engineering department at Canadian operated a facility described as the power plant. The director of the plant, Graeme Shelford, testified that the power plant contained a number of shops, which included the engine shop. There was a manager under Mr. Shelford, Bob Krause, who was responsible for the daily management of the plant and the engine shop. There were also supervisors in each of the individual shops, who reported directly to Mr. Krause and at least occasionally to Mr. Shelford. The supervisors in the engine shop during the relevant time were Don Strohmaier, Jerry Jureidin, and Al Hunger.\n[26] There were a number of work areas within the engine shop. This included the lines where different types of engines were serviced. It took from six to ten days to disassemble an engine, and up to two weeks to reassemble it. The repairs to the engines, modules, and parts were done off the lines. The engines were then reassembled, signed off and tested in the test cell, which was located in a large building on the same lot. There was also a balancing area and Area H, which was known as blade rework.\n[27] There were crews in each of the work areas, with six or more mechanics in each crew. Up until the fall of 1994, each of these crews had a foreman and an inspector. Mr. Hill's foreman was Kerry Ryan. Although the foremen were more like lead hands, and remained members of the union, they were responsible for assigning the work to individual members of the crew. The role of the inspector was to approve and sign off the crews' work. The foremen and inspectors reported to the supervisors in the engine shop. They did not have the authority to discipline the mechanics.\n[28] There were three lines in the engine shop, which were dedicated to the CF6-50, CF6-80 and JD-8 engines. Mr. Hill was on one of the three crews assigned to the CF6-80 or Dash-80 line, which worked a rotating shift. Mr. Ryan was the foreman. The crew would work two weeks of days, followed by one week of afternoons. It may be helpful to say that the Dash-80 was the newest and most sophisticated engine in the engine shop. It was therefore considered, by some employees at least, as the most prestigious area in which a mechanic might work. Mr. Kirby stated that any reassignment from the Dash-80 line to the JD-8 line was considered a first stage of punishment.\n[29] When an engine came into the shop, the planners in the engine shop would prepare a package of bulletins and service orders. The service package would be given to the foremen, who would distribute it to the crews. When the engines were disassembled, the mechanics would examine individual components and parts for abnormalities. This might require changes to the work orders. The supervisors would meet with the foremen in the mornings and give them worksheets listing the engines and the work that needed to be done. The foremen would then assign individual members of the crew to a particular engine.\n[30] The foremen would also assign specific tasks to individuals, particularly when there was a difficult job that needed immediate attention. Some of the jobs on the line were more technical than others and presented more challenging work. This included the removal and reinstallation of the HPT, the high-pressure turbine; the LPT, the low pressure turbine; and the core of the engine. Some of the less challenging jobs consisted of caulking, reinstalling the fuel lines, and preparing the engine for the test cell.\n[31] Once a mechanic was assigned to an engine, it was normal for the mechanic to continue work on the engine until the servicing was complete. Mechanics would also be given temporary assignments, however, to deal with shortages in other areas within the shop. If the supervisor needed another person in Area H, for example, he might ask a foreman to assign one of his mechanics to the relevant area. He might also assign a specific mechanic to the area. One of the witnesses, Ray Fletcher, testified that many mechanics would simply pick up the work where the last shift had left it. Mechanics who waited to be assigned to specific tasks would often end up with the jobs that no one else wanted.\n(iii) Area H [32] A jet engine contains fans, consisting of fan blades mounted on a central spoke, which push the air through the engine. The mechanics in Area H examined the fan blades for damage and irregularities, filed away nicks and scratches, and balanced the blades, so that they were properly balanced. Although the area was clean and well lit when we visited it, there was evidence that this left a fine dust on everything, which must have contained metal shavings and chemical residues. There was also evidence that hazardous chemicals like iodine and acetone were used in the process.\n[33] There was debate between counsel as to whether the work in Area H was menial work. Mr. Rodominski, who was known for his mechanical skills, described it as very repetitive work and quite boring at times. No one, he testified, really wanted to work there. This was borne out by the fact that the mechanics assigned to Area H did not have to serve a rotating shift. Mr. Shelford acknowledged that this was an incentive, which was necessary to keep the area fully staffed. There were nevertheless advantages to working in Area H, since it was a sit down job with substantial overtime and straight day shifts. As a result, there were senior mechanics who were permanently assigned to the area. Since these mechanics had their choice of holidays, Area H was understaffed during the summer.\n[34] Counsel for the Respondent stressed the value of the fan blades, which were worth as much as seventeen thousand dollars apiece, in American funds. Another witness, Jay Ghuman, testified that the work on the blades was important work, which required skill and effort. If a blade was not re-contoured properly, a rough surface or hairline crack could cause the blade to fracture and break, with calamitous consequences for those on board the plane. While I accept all of these observations, they do not address Mr. Hill's fundamental complaint, which is merely that the work was extremely tedious. This made it menial.\n[35] I have no doubt whatsoever that Area H was one of the least attractive assignments in the shop. Mr. Kirby suggested that an assignment to the area could be seen as a form of punishment and it is evident that many mechanics resented working there. I accept that the work in the area was menial and unrewarding. I think that I can take notice of the fact that the filing of metal blades, however expensive, did not excite the passions of the mechanics.\n[36] Some of the witnesses believed that most if not all of the mechanics in the engine shop had been assigned to work in Area H. Others stated that some of the mechanics had never worked in the area. There was also evidence that the proportion of visible minorities in areas like blade rework was much higher than in other areas in the shop. Mr. Kirby suggested that this was a reflection of the unfairness in the workplace, which led minorities to resign themselves to the less interesting work in the shop. The evidence of Mr. Fletcher, however, was that the members of minorities preferred to work together. The situation is open to a variety of interpretations.\n(iv) The Test Cell [37] Before an engine left the engine shop, it was necessary to determine whether it met the standards set by the manufacturers and the federal Ministry of Transportation. This was done in the test cell. Individual engines were moved from the engine shop to the cell, where they were harnessed and connected to a housing that permitted the testers to start and run the engine. Once the engine was coupled to the housing, it was run by means of a computer that simulated flight conditions. This was a relatively dramatic task, which was psychologically rewarding, since it determined whether the work on the engine had been successfully completed. One tester would run and observe the engine, while another tester would monitor the information from the computer to determine whether the engine met the required standards.\n[38] There were three mechanics who were designated as testers on the Dash-80 line. They received special training and were paid fifteen cents more per hour than the other mechanics. When there were no engines to be tested, they worked with the rest of the crew. The mechanics who had been working on an engine would also go with the engine when it went to the test cell. These mechanics would assist the tester in hoisting and connecting the engine to the temporary housing. When the testing was completed, they would help the tester make any necessary repairs, uncouple the harness, and complete the final check of the engine. The yoking and unyoking of the engine constituted the more laborious and less responsible part of the process.\nC. The Allegation of Discrimination (i) Work Assignments [39] Mr. Hill was well qualified as a mechanic. There is nevertheless no question that his attitude to his work at Canadian left a great deal to be desired. Mr. Hill was firmly convinced that he had talents that were never recognized by his employer. As a result, he seems to have developed the belief that some of the work to which he was assigned was beneath his dignity. This led his superiors to question his abilities and aptitude. This only added to his aversion to the work they were willing to assign him. There is evidence that he had tended to loiter and shirk his responsibilities.\n[40] Mr. Hill testified that he found the work environment on the 737 line at Canadian overtly racial. He was almost always assigned to the more menial tasks, such as cleaning cables, greasing, and gear fittings. The hostility came to a head when other mechanics said they had gotten rid of all the gooks and the pakis and there was just one more nigger to get rid of. Mr. Hill was the last person to be offered overtime, and was asked to work under the direction of less senior mechanics. Mr. Hill responded by requesting a transfer to the engine shop.\n[41] The parties at the hearing focussed on Mr. Hill's time in the engine shop. The fundamental allegation is that Mr. Hill's foreman gave him the most menial tasks on the line. Mr. Kirby testified that Mr. Ryan, would assign him to blade rework, viewing, balancing, test cell prep, and the installation of fan blades, all of which was menial work. These jobs included changing filters and harnessing or unharnessing engines in the test cell. Some of this work was dirty work. Mr. Ryan would not assign Mr. Hill to more complex tasks unless there was nobody else around. Mr. Hill also testified that he was assigned to Area H on August 23rd and 24th, 1993. He suggested that these kinds of jobs should have been rotated among the different mechanics in the shop.\n[42] In a letter of complaints, which was addressed to the Chairman of the union, Mr. Hill described the situation as follows:\nRecently, I have been discriminated against by the floor management in shop 750. The same management has systematically selected and groomed certain individuals described as glory boys, and they seemed to share a certain kinship amongst themselves. While these individuals are being groomed to further their careers, visible minorities are discouraged and pushed aside.\nThe visible minorities are allocated menial tasks which stifle their drive and determination. They are not given the same opportunities to develop and further their careers. The select personnel are encouraged to stay on the problem solving and technical jobs. Their reward is advancement in the company. They are not assigned any menial tasks and on occasion, they are sent to relieve a visible minority worker who has began [sic] a technical job.\nIt was Mr. Ryan's treatment of Mr. Hill that apparently precipitated the complaint to the union.\n[43] In his letter to the union chair, Mr. Hill stated that he had been assigned to Area H three times in two months, an allocation of duties that would raise some suspicions. When the Complainant and the Commission submit that Mr. Ryan assigned Mr. Hill to Area H the majority of the time, however, they overstate the evidence. The oral evidence merely establishes that Mr. Hill was assigned to blade rework on three or four occasions while he was on the Dash-80 line. Mr. Ryan did not accept that Mr. Hill was sent to blade rework on a regular basis. On the two occasions where the matter came to a head, Mr. Hill went home sick and did not work his assigned shift.\n[44] One of these situations occurred on August 23, 1993, when Mr. Hill allegedly arrived late. Mr. Ryan states that Mr. Hill was the last mechanic to report and was therefore assigned to blade rework. This seems to go against the account he gave to Laurie Ferguson and Hunter Rogers, which was that Mr. Hill was the second last person to arrive for work. It is always possible that the Ferguson-Rogers report is mistaken, but I think the more important factor is that the Complainant did not take issue with the fact that he was late. It is true that this may have simply given Mr. Ryan the reason that he needed to assign a particularly troublesome employee to someone else.\n[45] Rather than go to Area H, as he was directed, Mr. Hill returned home sick, on the basis that he felt too stressed to work that day. When the supervisor was advised of the situation, he told Mr. Ryan to assign Mr. Hill to blade rework on the following day. The following day, when this occurred, Mr. Hill went home sick again and did not return for a week. Mr. Hill was indignant because he arrived early on the second day and suggested that Mr. Ryan was not following his own system in assigning him to blade rework. The last person in, he suggested, should have been sent to blade rework.\n[46] Mr. Hill's attitude was disingenuous and ignores the larger picture. It is notable that the Complainant and Commission stubbornly ignored the obvious insubordination in his actions. I am of the view that management did not deal with the situation. The matter was not handled properly, since the supervisor and the foreman clearly thought that Mr. Hill was feigning sickness. They should have called him on the issue. In any event, the real issue between the Complainant and his superiors had progressed well beyond the assignment to Area H.\n[47] The relations between Mr. Hill and Mr. Ryan were strained, to say the least, and Mr. Ryan may have been quick to assign Mr. Hill to Area H. If this was the case, however, it had more to do with the enmity between the two men than with the fact that Mr. Hill was black. The evidence on the substantive issue is minimal at best, and the problems with the Complainant's evidence are sufficient to prevent me from accepting it without more support from other witnesses.\n[48] The Complainant and Commission have argued that Mr. Ryan monitored Mr. Hill more closely than other employees. I have no doubt that this was the case, at least later in the process, when the two men had become adversaries. There was an allegation, for example, that he would be questioned when he returned from the washroom. If he was shirking his duties, of course, this was entirely justified. I do not accept that Mr. Ryan was malicious or fabricated events. There were limits to his enmity. There is no doubt that in Mr. Ryan's mind, Mr. Hill was an unreliable employee, who was not pulling his weight in the shop. There was evidence from almost all the witnesses that supported this view. Mr. Hill required monitoring.\n[49] Mr. Hill alleges that he received more than his fair share of unattractive work assignments, both on the line and in the other areas of the shop. He also testified that he repeatedly asked for more technical jobs on the Dash-80 line. He gives examples of this in one of the complaint before me: on December 6, 1993, he states he was assigned to an engine when only the menial jobs remained. On September 6, 1994, while doing technical work, he was reassigned to more menial work. He provided a number of other examples, some of which were clearly refuted by the assignment sheets that were used to keep a record of who worked on specific engines, which were filed as exhibits.\n[50] The passage of time has made the reconstruction of what occurred all that more difficult, however, the concrete facts that one would expect in substantiating such a charge was missing. Mr. Hill's recollection of what occurred was partial and impressionistic, and many of the circumstances of which he complained were open to interpretation. There is no question that he felt discriminated against, but the evidence presented by the Complainant and Commission consisted more of allegations than facts. The quality of the evidence was poor at best.\n[51] Mr. Hill also states that Mr. Ryan gave him new service bulletins after he had completed a job and had him re-do the work. Mr. Hill felt that this was done on purpose, to make life difficult to him. There was bad blood between the men at this point in time because Mr. Hill had complained about Mr. Ryan. Mr. Hill also testified that after Mr. Ryan threw the pages on the work podium so violently that he instinctively backed away from him. There was real hostility between the two men by this point in time, and if Mr. Hill was suggesting that Mr. Ryan's conduct was unprovoked, I do not accept his testimony. It is obvious from the evidence that Mr. Hill had his own ways of challenging his immediate superiors.\n[52] There were other incidents, such as Mr. Hill's exchange with Jeff Reimer, who had been given the responsibility for renewing licenses. Mr. Hill accosted Mr. Reimer on the shop floor, as if he was an underling, who could be imposed upon at will. Mr. Hill's application was already late and rather than apologize or acknowledge his tardiness, he goaded Mr. Reimer into an angry exchange. Although Mr. Reimer may not have conducted himself appropriately for a member of management, the reality is that Mr. Hill's attitude was provocative and high-handed. It is characteristic that Mr. Hill's response to the incident was to formally complain about Mr. Reimer's attitude.\n[53] There were other incidents. There was an exchange with Jerry Jureidin, one of the supervisors, when Mr. Hill was caught photocopying pages from a manual. Mechanics were expected to work from originals and there are serious policy reasons why this was not permitted. Mr. Hill was also using the photocopier without permission. Rather than apologize, he adopted an indifferent attitude, which must have confirmed the prevailing view that he did not accept the authority of his superiors. This kind of behaviour only exacerbated the situation. I recognize that Mr. Hill found himself in an unpleasant environment, but I am satisfied that his conduct was probably the most significant factor in creating the situation in which he found himself.\n[54] Mr. Kirby provided the strongest evidence in support of Mr. Hill's allegations. In his testimony, he adopted the statement that he had made to Ms. Ferguson and Mr. Hunter, claiming that anyone entering the shop will be aware of the preferential treatment within five minutes. Mr. Kirby testified that Mr. Ryan would only assign Mr. Hill to the more challenging jobs in the shop when there was no one else available. He also testified that the visible minorities in the shops were concentrated in the areas away from the actual lines, where the less challenging mechanical work was done. Mr. Kirby also stated that the visible minorities tended to be prominent in areas like blade rework, viewing and balancing. The testimony of Mr. Abbing and Mr. Fletcher supported such an observation. Mr. Fletcher suggested that the members of visible minorities wanted to be together, and therefore gravitated towards the same areas in the shop.\n[55] Although I understand why Mr. Kirby reached the conclusions that he did, there is a speculative element in his views that I cannot adopt. Accusations of discrimination, however sincere, are not enough. It can certainly be inferred, from the comments of many of the witnesses, that there were racial communities within the engine shop. I am not prepared to go further, however, on the basis of accusations. It would be presumptuous to conclude that the distribution of employees in different areas of the shop was a result of overt discrimination.\n[56] There was discord in the workplace without a doubt, and some of it had a racial signifier. The evidence of witnesses like Mr. Kirby, Mr. Hui and Mr. Panis established that minorities did not feel they had the same opportunities in Canadian as other mechanics. Mr. Kirby and Mr. Hibbert both testified that minorities were simply not in the running for the better positions in the shop. Mr. Hibbert was concerned enough to write a letter of complaint in 1988, raising issues similar to those of Mr. Hill. The complaints before me are personal complaints and the evidence of systemic discrimination is only relevant insofar as it provides a context in which to consider what happened to Mr. Hill. The Complainant and Commission described the more general testimony as similar fact evidence, but Mr. Hill's situation seems to have developed independently of any pattern of discrimination in the shop.\n(ii) The Application for the Planner III Position [57] While he was assigned to the tire and brake shop, in 1993, Mr. Hill applied for the position of Aircraft Planner III. There was extensive evidence before me regarding the posting of this position, the process of choosing the final applicants, the interview process, the decision-making process and Mr. Hill's response to the decision. The evidence establishes two rather different propositions. The first is that the selection committee assumed that the successful applicant had the proper qualifications for the position. This included an ACA, an Aircraft Certification Authority. It is clear, in retrospect, that he did not have such an authority, or obtain it after receiving the position. This was in clear contravention of the posting.\n[58] The second proposition is that the committee had good reasons to reject Mr. Hill's application for the position. Although he was more senior than the successful applicant, he was not familiar with the responsibilities of the Planner III position and did not fare well in the interview. I am of the view that the successful applicant should not have been awarded the position, and I suspect that politics was at work, somewhere. I do not accept, however, that this had any effect on Mr. Hill's candidacy. There is no convincing evidence that the committee had racial motives.\n[59] I heard evidence from two members of the committee. The evidence of Mr. Clement, who was very frail, was problematic. Although Mr. Clement was a sincere witness, with a great deal of managerial experience, he clearly changed his scores in a misguided attempt to accommodate the other members of the committee. This was inappropriate, to say the least. It does not establish, however, that the committee had a discriminatory animus. These problems raise issues under the collective agreement, rather than a question under the law of human rights.\n[60] I have already stated that I was impressed with the evidence of Scott Hunter, the other committee member who was a forthright witness, with an excellent recollection of the facts. Mr. Hunter was quite willing to acknowledge that the position should not have been awarded to the successful candidate and suggested that the union could have grieved the decision. None of this redeems Mr. Hill's conduct during the interview, which failed to hit the mark. When he was asked why he wanted the position, for example, Mr. Hill went into a relatively long monologue about his aspirations as a novelist. This was unprofessional and clearly out of keeping with the interview process. It probably explains the comments of the third committee member, Ms. Lange, who wrote on her assessment sheet that Mr. Hill was laid back. I think it is stretching the truth to suggest that this comment was racially motivated.\n[61] The problem with the case for the Complainant is simply that the evidence does not establish that race was a factor in the selection process. The evidence is merely that Mr. Hill, who was a member of a racial minority, did not receive the position. I think it is fair to say that Mr. Hill would have been entitled to a new competition, like the other applicants, but I find very little in the evidence that would suggest he was the best candidate. This is evident in the scoring, even when the problems with Mr. Clement's score sheets are taken into account. I am simply unable to see any injustice in the committee's failure to award him the position.\n[62] It is characteristic that Mr. Hill complained about the selection process for the Planner III position and spoke to Mr. Clement about the interview process. This merely presented an opportunity for new allegations, which are not worthy of comment. In Mr. Hill's mind, this nevertheless added to his mounting sense of injustice. I think it is fair to say that Mr. Hill felt persecuted by the progress of events.\n(iii) The Events of October 18, 1994 [63] There is no question that Mr. Hill felt oppressed by his experience in the engine shop. I believe that his failure to obtain the Planner III position was a serious disappointment, which added to the emotional pressure on him. He was also going through some personal difficulties. I have no desire to minimize what he experienced and it was clearly a difficult time for him. In any event, the tensions in the workplace reached their inevitable climax on October 18, 1994, in the supervisors' office.\n[64] Some of the facts relating to the events of October 18, 1994, are not in dispute. On September 13, 1994, Mr. Cavasin submitted a speedy memo requesting that he exchange shifts with Mr. Hill until November 15, 1994. This was unusual, since Mr. Cavasin usually preferred to work afternoons, and would trade his day shifts with mechanics who wanted to stay on the day shift. His testimony was that his wife was on maternity leave and it was more convenient, in these circumstances, to work days. It appears that mechanics frequently switched shifts and there was nothing out of the ordinary in this request.\n[65] As a result of the change in shifts, Mr. Hill was assigned to afternoons on October 18, 1994. On the 17th or 18th, however, Mr. Hill stated that the two men agreed to return to their original shifts. I am inclined to believe that this was done at Mr. Hill's request, in spite of his evidence that he was accommodating Mr. Cavasin. Mr. Hill's testimony was nevertheless that he submitted a speedy memo on October 17, 1994, requesting that he return to day shift the following day. The memo requested that the previous memo be withdrawn.\n[66] I think it is significant, in understanding the psychology of the situation, that the memo required approval. There was some dispute about this, but in the final analysis, management had the right to refuse the request. It is apparent that the process for changing shifts had been abused by the mechanics, who generally wanted to work days, and there were times when three or four mechanics all claimed to have switched their shifts with Mr. Cavasin. There was therefore some sensitivity on this issue.\n[67] On October 18, 1994, for some reason which no one has adequately explained, both gentlemen arrived at work for the day shift. Although the evidence did not establish who was at fault, I suspect that Mr. Hill had not advised Mr. Cavasin of the memo he had filed on the previous day, or that it had yet to be approved. This is borne out by the fact that Mr. Ryan asked Mr. Hill why he was reporting for the day shift. He explained that he had submitted a speedy memo requesting the change in shifts.\n[68] Mr. Ryan asked Mr. Hill to speak to Mr. Strohmaier and Mr. Jureidin, both of whom were supervisors. They merely asked him to have Mr. Cavasin sign the memo from the previous day. There appears to have been some confusion as to whether Mr. Cavasin had traded shifts with Mr. Hill or someone else. At the very least, something was out of order. When Mr. Hill took the memo to Mr. Cavasin, the latter signed it and wrote sarcastically why tell me. This seems to support the suggestion that Mr. Cavasin was not completely aware that the shift was being changed.\n[69] I believe that Mr. Cavasin's explanation of events makes the most sense. He testified that he put a smart ass remark on the first memo to sabotage the memo a bit. He was kind of like giving him the gears a bit, eh and make - you know - there was a lot of tomfoolery. In any event, Mr. Cavasin wanted to force Mr. Hill to fill in another memo and come back for a second signature. Mr. Hill turned the tables on him by taking the memo into the supervisor's office, much to the chagrin of his superiors.\n[70] When he was told to fill out another memo, and have it properly signed, Mr. Hill went back to Mr. Cavasin, who testified that he didn't believe Mr. Hill had taken the first memo to the supervisors. I cannot help but wonder if Mr. Cavasin was resentful of the fact that Mr. Hill had changed shifts on him. On the second memo, Mr. Hill wrote Ross C. and I would like to mutually transfer our shifts back to normal starting now. When he went back to Mr. Cavasin, Mr. Cavasin signed the memo, but could not refrain from writing another sarcastic comment. This comment was what is normal?\n[71] It is evident that it took an inordinate amount of time to complete this process. Having seen the shop, it is apparent to me that it should not have taken more than ten minutes to deal with the two memos. The supervisors apparently thought that Mr. Hill was writing the comments, but allowed him to continue on the day shift. During the morning, Mr. Ryan complained to the supervisors that he was not getting much work out of Mr. Hill. There is evidence suggesting that Mr. Cavasin's foreman had also complained. The evidence suggests that there was a certain amount of loitering and bantering between Mr. Hill and Mr. Cavasin, which may have irritated the foremen. At about 12:30 p.m., Mr. Cavasin and Mr. Hill were called to a meeting with Mr. Jureidin, Mr. Strohmaier, and Mr. Abbing, a shop steward.\n[72] I do not accept Mr. Hill's portrayal of himself as a passive participant in these events. The original memo had obviously not been processed, and since he was requesting the change, he was responsible for setting Mr. Cavasin's signature. It is also obvious that he was a shrewd and insightful employee, who would have known that he was stoking the fires by returning the memos with the sarcastic comments from his confr\u00e8re. Both men had a reputation for failing to respect authority and any responsible manager would have felt obliged to reacquaint them with the proper protocols.\n[73] After the issue of changing shifts was resolved, Mr. Jureidin turned to the issue of socializing. When Mr. Cavasin's foreman walked by the office, he was called into the meeting. Under considerable pressure from Mr. Cavasin, he denied that he had complained to the supervisors. The conversation then switched to Mr. Ryan, who was paged and came to the office. This led to a shouting match between Mr. Hill and Mr. Ryan, which escalated out of all proportion. Mr. Cavasin testified that Mr. Ryan: came into the office, and the rest is just a blur, I mean it was ugly.\n[74] The office in question was extremely confined and one can only imagine what it was like when the shouting match occurred. At some point, Mr. Hill told Mr. Ryan to get his facts straight and walked out of the office, slamming the door behind him. Mr. Cavasin testified that the men were on the verge of blows and suggested that there would have been a fight if Mr. Hill had not left the room. Mr. Hill went immediately to Mr. Shelford's office and discussed the matter with him. Mr. Shelford could see that Mr. Hill was extremely upset and gave him permission to go home. He did not return to work at Canadian.\nD. The Allegation of Harassment [75] There was a discussion about the nature of racism during the hearing. I would endorse the position put forward by the Complainant and the Commission, who argued that the members of dominant groups in society are often blind to the existence of discrimination and harassment. Counsel referred me to a passage in Naraine v. Ford Motor Co. of Canada (No. 4), (1985) 27 C.H.R.R. 230 (Ont. Bd. of Inq.), at para. 25, where the Board recognized that the members of racial minorities often possess a certain amount of expertise on the subject. This is a product of their long experience with prejudiced and even oppressive members of the majority. I think this is a cautionary principle, which must be kept in mind in considering the testimony of the witnesses in a case based on an allegation of racism, particularly in the instance of harassment.\n[76] In his complaint of harassment, Mr. Hill gives five examples of racist graffiti that he saw on the bathroom walls. This included the swastika and statements like All niggers must die and I see nothing wrong with niggers, everyone should own one. All of the witnesses agreed that there was graffiti in the washrooms at Canadian. This graffiti included demeaning sexual comments, racist comments and character assassination. The evidence establishes that the sexual graffiti was predominant, though the racial comments formed part of the larger problem. The matter was troubling enough that Mr. Shelford, the Director of the power plant, made a number of efforts to correct it. This included painting the washrooms black, a strategy that was apparently unsuccessful in the long run. White boards were also placed in the washrooms, to try and contain the problem. Although the only real solution seemed to lie in continually repainting the washrooms, the financial constraints on the company prevented the company from doing so very often.\n[77] Mr. Hill also provided five examples of racist jokes that he heard in the engine shop. The tenor of these jokes is evident in the following examples:\n\"Niggers and Chinks were used to build the railroad because the owners did not want to waste mules bringing nitro-glycerine in.\" - told by a co-worker, in 1992.\n\"How do you baby-sit little nigger kids? Wet their lips and stick them to the ceiling.\" - told by Kerry Ryan, my foreman, in spring 1993.\nGeorge Lenihan told a story about going out with friends and hitting black people with broom handles from the back of a pick-up truck, which he referred to as broom the coon.\nI am not satisfied that Kerry Ryan told the second joke, though it may have been told by someone, and it is clear, I accept that mechanics tried to outdo each other in telling tasteless and derogatory jokes.\n[78] The complaint also alleges that Mr. Ryan called Mr. Hill a nig nog on several occasions. Mr. Kirby felt that this was a surreptitious way of calling him a nigger. It was not until Mr. Ryan took the stand that the two meanings of the term emerged. Mr. Ryan stated that he had used the same term with his children, and produced a definition from the Internet, explaining that the term was used in Lancashire to express mild disapproval of someone's action. On this reading, it merely meant a silly person and was not a racial term.\n[79] I cannot be sure what Mr. Ryan's intentions were, in using the term nig nog, though I have suspicions that Mr. Kirby's view is the right tone. I do not find the suggestion that Mr. Ryan would use the same language in speaking to his children and Mr. Hill completely convincing, particularly in a place where strong language was the order of the day. It is unclear to me why he had to use any epithets at all. I nevertheless accept Mr. Ryan's evidence that he did not use the term after Mr. Hill questioned its use. I do not find Mr. Hill's testimony that Mr. Ryan continued to use the term on just about every occasion [when] he addressed me a credible statement.\n[80] The most troubling evidence of harassment relates to the time that Mr. Hill spent on the 737 line in the area known as the hangar. Mr. Hill testified that there were jokes about niggers, gooks, pakis and stuff like this, day in and day out. He also testified that there was a constant attempt to denegrate the black race. Gordy White, another mechanic, would always refer to him as nigger. There was little independent evidence of this, and Mr. Hill may or may not have overstated the situation, but I accept that racial language was used. Mr. Cavasin testified that mechanics still refer to each other as wops, polacks and flips. He distinguished between these names and racial slurs, however, and I do not believe that the social environment on the Dash-80 line can be compared to the situation on the 737 line.\n[81] I regret to say that there was a general lack of respect on the shop floor. One of the problems for Mr. Hill is that there is evidence that he participated in the constant baiting that occurred within the engine shop. This was in keeping with his general resentment of authority. Mr. Ghuman testified, for example, that Mr. Hill used the nickname old set of pissflaps for another mechanic. He apparently used this appellation regularly in the face of the employee, who replied in kind. Mr. Ghuman testified that they looked forward to putting each other down. He also testified that Mr. Hill referred openly to another employee as dumb cunner, another reference to the female anatomy.\n[82] There is also the Canadian Performance Rating Form, which was entered into evidence. Mr. Hill was evasive and equivocal when he was asked whether he had filled out this form, saying only that the hand writing looked like his. He went on to grudgingly admit that he had completed the form, but in a way that minimized his actions. The form appears to be a mock-up of a personnel record made out in the name of Gordie White. It describes Mr. White's job as dogfucker. Mr. Hill has placed check marks beside entries on the sheet like the following:\nDoes shitty work and constantly fucks up.\nHe works only if kicked in the ass frequently.\nThe stupid bast'd doesn't know shit from shinola.\nPiss - poor attitude, thinks always being shit on.\nThis is an example of the rough and ready nature of the exchanges that took place on the shop floor on a regular basis.\n[83] It is significant, in the context of harassment, that Canadian also had a workplace harassment policy. One of the purposes of the harassment policy was to ensure that employees were aware of the seriousness of such conduct. Although there was evidence that the employees were not aware of the policy, my view of the situation is that the culture within the workplace was changing during the time that Mr. Hill was in the engine shop. There is no doubt that Mr. Hill's complaint may have been a factor in this, since the Ferguson-Rogers report, the report from Ms. Knorr, and the directions from Mr. Shelford all contributed to an increasing awareness that racial comments were no longer acceptable.\n[84] There were other developments which helped to establish this, such as the initial and rather hapless attempts of the employer to determine the distribution of visible minorities throughout the shop. There was also harassment training, at least by the union, and the evidence established that the company subsequently made an attempt to see that members of minorities were given an opportunity to advance.\nE. The Complainant's Grievances and the Internal Investigations (i) The First Grievance [85] The Complainant filed three grievances under the collective agreement with respect to the matters raised by the two complaints before me. The first was filed on September 1, 1993 under Article 39 of the collective agreement, which dealt with sexual and personal harassment, and raised the issue of grooming. I have already mentioned the letter in which Mr. Hill alleged that some mechanics were groomed for promotion, and others left out, on the basis of race. Mr. Hill stated specifically that the members of minorities were not assigned to work and problem solving in areas which would allow them to develop their skills to meet the criteria for advancement. He accordingly requested that the matter be investigated and that a program be set up to assist minorities and encourage them to apply for more responsible positions.\n[86] As a result of the Complainant's grievance, a committee consisting of Hunter Rogers and Laurie Ferguson, a management and union representative, investigated the situation in the engine shop. In the course of their investigation, they interviewed Mr. Hill, Mr. Ryan, and a number of mechanics. They subsequently produced a report of their findings, which was completed in October, 1993 and entered as exhibit C-1.13 in the hearing.\n[87] The report contains three important conclusions. The first was as follows:\nWe believe that harassment has taken place in this area but find that [it] is very hard to associate with a particular individual.\nThe second concerns assignment of work:\nThe allocation and distribution of jobs in the shop is another matter. While there is a perception of unequal distribution of work that could go as far as seeming to select certain individuals for advancement there is inconclusive evidence of this. There does, however, seem to be some lack of sensitivity to the concerns of the employees and there has been no effective clarification of the work allocation system.\nThis remains an issue between the parties.\n[88] The third conclusion in the Ferguson-Rogers report reflects the lack of morale at Canadian during this period of time:\nAn overall malaise seems to exist within the shop that manifests itself in the unacceptable ways. The workers are late reporting to work, take extended coffee breaks, and are unhappy when assigned to the more mundane tasks. They make jokes and comments that some employees find offensive yet the situation is allowed to continue. People choose to ignore the problem rather than address it. Ignoring a problem does not make it go away, it just poisons the environment in which it festers.\nThe suggestion is that the continuing problems with the company were enough, in themselves, to poison the work environment.\n[89] At the end of the report, Ms. Ferguson and Mr. Rogers made three recommendations. They were as follows:\nA fair and equitable system for the allocation of work should be established. Employees should be made aware that the use of derogatory comments or racial slurs in the workplace will not be tolerated. Any such conduct violates company policy and the law. Remind employees in the area of the availability of [the Employee Assistance Program] and the services they can provide during this stressful period in which we find ourselves.\nThe report was forwarded to John Madden, the Director of Employee Support.\n[90] Mr. Fakirani took issue with the Ferguson-Rogers report. He argued that it was not a thorough investigation, that its conclusions were misleading, and that it failed to deal with the allegations raised by the Complainant. Counsel for the Complainant and Commission have also argued that the report was out of time under the collective agreement. The Respondent was dragging its feet. It is easy to find fault with the details of the report, however, and neglect its substance. On the whole, I believe that the report was a sincere attempt to deal with the substance of Mr. Hill's grievance.\n[91] Counsel has suggested that the authors of the report did not appreciate the onus that the law places on the employer and that the authors made the mistake of looking for examples of deliberate rather than institutional racism. These are legal issues, however, and neglects the factual nature of the report. Ms. Ferguson and Mr. Rogers appear to have tried to give all of the relevant individuals a reasonable opportunity to present their version of events. As I have already stated, they had the benefit of speaking to these individuals before they had a chance to consider the impact of what they were seeing. I believe that the Ferguson-Rogers report provides a good sense of the situation that prevailed in the engine shop.\n[92] Whatever the problems with the report, Ms. Ferguson and Mr. Rogers made a somewhat equivocal finding of discrimination. Mr. Fakirani argued that this should have rung the alarm and alerted Canadian to the seriousness of the situation. The argument on the other side is that it did exactly that. Mr. Madden sent Mr. Hill a letter on November 3, 1993, setting out his own recommendations with regard to the implementation of the report. These were as follows:\nThat a fair and equitable system of work and allocation be developed and communicated by Mr. Shelford. That Mr. Shelford make the leaders in the engine shop aware of their responsibilities to ensure a harassment free workplace. That Mr. Shelford make employees aware that the use of derogatory comments or racial slurs will not be tolerated.\nAs the Director, Mr. Shelford had final authority over the entire operations of the engine shop.\n[93] Mr. Madden's letter was copied to Mr. Shelford, who testified that he complied with the first two recommendations in a number of ways. For one thing, he raised the issue of harassment with the supervisors. He also mentioned the subject at staff meetings and directed that the harassment policy be posted on the bulletin board. The evidence as to whether the employees were aware of the issue was mixed, but there is no reason why some of the witnesses would remember these actions years after the fact. I was impressed with Mr. Shelford's evidence and accept that he addressed the issue with both his supervisors and the employees at large. Mr. Hill disputed the latter contention, but his attendance was such that he could have missed the meetings, and I see no reason to disbelieve Mr. Shelford.\n[94] The Complainant and Commission argued that any meeting should have been compulsory, but the company was in a desperate financial position and the evidence establishes that there was no problem with attendance, since the employees were anxious for information regarding the company. While he could not have been completely aware of the situation between Mr. Hill and Mr. Ryan, I believe that Mr. Shelford made a conscientious attempt to implement Mr. Madden's recommendations.\n[95] This left the question whether the system of assigning work in the shop was discriminatory. This is where the complaint of discrimination really lies. The Commission and the Complainant have argued that Mr. Shelford failed to take this question seriously. I do not think this is entirely fair to Mr. Shelford, though I naturally agree that Mr. Shelford, Mr. Strohmaier and other managers did not feel that the system of assigning work was unfair or inequitable. In their view, work would have to be assigned in accordance with the priorities of the day. This would mean that the skills and experience of the various mechanics would have to be taken into account by the relevant supervisor or foreman, who would have to make a subjective call as to who should be assigned to a particular task. Since this practice was in place, they accordingly felt that a fair and equitable method of allocating work was already in place.\n[96] Mr. Shelford dealt with the recommendation by requesting that the company's employment equity co-ordinator, Marjorie Knorr, investigate the way in which work was distributed within the engine shop. On February 23, 1994, Ms. Knorr accordingly visited the engine shop and reviewed the system of assigning work. As I have already indicated, there is a dispute between the parties as to whether there was a meaningful system in place. I do not feel that much is to be gained by weighing in on the discussion between counsel as to whether the practice followed by the foreman and supervisors in assigning temporary work meets the definition of a system. It may be more helpful to say that it was an informal rather than a formal system, which gave the managerial staff a great deal of latitude in making such assignments. I am nevertheless of the view that there was a system, a loose way of doing things, though it was characterized by improvisation and relied upon the exercise of personal judgment by foremen and supervisors.\n[97] Ms. Knorr spent an afternoon at the engine shop, at which time she reviewed the system of temporary assignments with the supervisors and foremen. She was apparently taken through the relevant paperwork, and apprised of the general considerations that they employed in assigning work. Her focus was entirely on the system and she did not speak to individual mechanics. I do not accept Mr. Hill's suggestion that Ms. Knorr was a captive of management and it was clear to me that she performed her investigation in a sincere and conscientious manner. Subsequently Ms. Knorr prepared a relatively impromptu report for Mr. Shelford, which was entered as exhibit C-1.20. The report concludes that the system was not discriminatory, though Ms. Knorr acknowledged on the witness stand that it could be abused by individual foremen.\n[98] Ms. Knorr's report is dated March 10, 1994 and states that the foremen in the shop use a variety of criteria to distribute work in the shop. These criteria include the following factors:\n\u00b7 people who were most experienced and productive were assigned to rush jobs;\n\u00b7 new or inexperienced people are put with more experienced staff;\n\u00b7 less motivated employees are placed with more motivated employees;\n\u00b7 when less favourable jobs are to be assigned a variety of ways are used; the crew will determine who's turn it is, a coin will be tossed, or the job is given to the person who arrives last\n[99] Ms. Knorr concluded that work was assigned primarily on work performance. This was naturally subject of the perceptions of the foremen, whose view of their crew members was essential in determining who was given more technical or demanding work.\n[100] Ms. Knorr also investigated the process for determining who would receive training. She found no evidence of discrimination and did not feel that there was a reason to investigate the distribution of work and training any further. Her report was sent to Mr. Shelford, who distributed it to the supervisors in the engine shop. The foremen in the shop were alerted to the concerns that led to the writing of the report. Although there were attempts to clarify and improve the system for distributing work, it is understandable that management felt that the report had exonerated them.\n[101] Counsel have complained that the Knorr report, like the Ferguson-Rogers report, was inadequate. If it did not reveal evidence of discrimination, the argument goes, it was because Ms. Knorr did not investigate the matter thoroughly. This seems to be the response of the Complainant to many of the deficiencies in the evidence and leads nowhere. The truth is that I am left with a choice between the evidence of the Complainant and a growing list of more reliable witnesses. I accept Ms. Knorr's evidence that:\nthe impact of shift changes, crew changes, bumping, types of jobs, the occasions and sick leave, and the variety of priorities lead me to believe that applying discriminatory practices to work assignments would be very difficult.\nThe Commission and Complainant have argued that this only proves that the work was distributed in an arbitrary and therefore discriminatory way, but this seriously overstates her testimony and does not support the Complainant's case.\n[102] The Complainant and Commission have suggested that there was too much room for flexibility in the existing system, which left it open to foremen and supervisors to abuse their authority. This raises another issue, however, which was not the subject of the systems review carried out by Ms. Knorr. This narrows the scope of the present inquiry. If the system for allocating work was fair, it cannot be the source of the discrimination Mr. Hill is alleged to have suffered, and the issue is whether Mr. Ryan abused his authority. Although there was considerable enmity between the two men, I think the evidence establishes that Mr. Ryan took his managerial responsibilities seriously. There is no convincing evidence that he abused his position.\n[103] Mr. Hill appealed his grievance to the district lodge of the IAM, which referred the matter to binding arbitration. Vincent Ready was appointed as an Arbitrator and the arbitration was heard on September 15, 1994. Mr. Ready was asked to determine whether the recommendations in the Ferguson-Rogers report had been adequately implemented. There seems to be some suggestion on the part of the Complainant and Commission that the union was not as zealous in prosecuting Mr. Hill's grievance as it might have been. There may be some truth to such an allegation, but this could easily be interpreted as a reflection of the fact that it was not completely convinced of the merits of the case.\n[104] Mr. Ready issued his award on October 19, 1994, which reviewed the Ferguson-Rogers' report and held that:\nI have carefully reviewed the evidence and the submissions of the parties. I am satisfied that the recommendations [in the Ferguson-Rogers' report] are an appropriate response to Mr. Hill's complaints. The union could point to no specific company action or omission which would support the claim that it has not effectively implemented the recommendations. To the contrary, I find that both parties have carried out the recommendations to the extent practical and possible.\n[105] Mr. Ready accepted Ms. Knorr's report on the distribution of work and training, and then went on to deal with the question of harassment. While Mr. Ready did not accept that harassment had been established, he left it open to Mr. Hill or any other employee to raise the problem in the future. Mr. Ready ordered that his award be posted in the engine shop, along with the conclusions and recommendations in the Ferguson-Rogers report, and the company's harassment policy.\n[106] Although the Ferguson-Rogers report was rather vague, I think there was a genuine attempt to address the issues that Mr. Hill had raised. Some of the vagueness in the company's response was a product of the hesitation in the report, which was tentative at best. It does not contain the kind of explicit finding that would vindicate Mr. Hill's complaint of discrimination and seems more designed to placate the Complainant than anything else. The report suggests, in point of fact, that there is no evidence of explicit discrimination and merely speaks to the insensitivity of the employees in the engine shop.\n(ii) The Second Grievance [107] Mr. Hill filed the second grievance on July 29, 1994, with respect to his unsuccessful application for the Aircraft Maintenance Planner III position. In this grievance, he requested a meeting with the interviewers. Although the grievance was denied, Mr. Clement and Mr. Hunter eventually met with Mr. Hill. After discussing the interview, and the selection process as a whole, Mr. Hill withdrew his grievance.\n(iii) The Third Grievance [108] Mr. Hill also filed a third grievance under Article 39 of the collective agreement alleging personal harassment. This grievance arose out of the climactic events of October 18, 1994. Dave Park and Ted Pierre, a union and a management representative, conducted separate investigations into the matter at the end of January 1995. Their findings were combined in a set of joint recommendations. Although Mr. Park and Mr. Pierre expressed sympathy for Mr. Hill, and did not approve of the way in which the meeting was handled, they rejected the allegation of harassment.\n[109] The company held a meeting with the individuals involved in the events of October 18th on March 10, 1995 to discuss the Park and Pierre report. This was described as a meeting of the whole. Mr. Hill attended the meeting, along with Mr. Shelford, Mr. Strohmaier, Mr. Jureidin, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Abbing, Mr. Cavasin, Mr. Park, and Mr. Pierre. Mr. Hill was advised that he was welcome to return to the engine shop. Mr. Ryan had been transferred to a plant at Tilbury, where the Dash-80 line was now situated. Mr. Hill advised at the meeting that he would not return to work until the issues between himself and the company had been resolved. He expressed continuing concern with the situation of minorities in the engine shop, took issue with Ms. Knorr's report, and raised questions with respect to the programs available to minorities.\n[110] Mr. Hill subsequently received two letters from Canadian advising him that his employment would be terminated if the company did not hear from him. His evidence was that Mr. Beaudin at the B.C. Human Rights Coalition responded to these letters on May 17, 1996, informing the company that Mr. Hill wished to return to work but only when the matter was resolved. Mr. Hill's employment with Canadian was eventually terminated by a registered letter dated October 9, 1996, in which the Respondent stated that it had closed his file and was now requesting the repayment of some four thousand dollars in pay and benefits. The Respondent did not acknowledge receipt of Mr. Beaudin's letter.\nIII. ANALYSIS A.Prima Facie Case [111] The present case does not raise complicated legal issues. At the end of the hearing, I nevertheless raised the question whether there was any need to decide whether the Complainant and Commission had established a prima facie case. This calls for further elaboration.\n[112] The decisions in the area hold that the initial burden in the human rights process lies with the Complainant, who must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Once a prima facie case is established, it is usually said that the Respondent has the burden of explaining. The traditional source of this formulation is O'Malley v. Simpson Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, which dealt with a bona fide occupational requirement. Some of the more recent case law now suggests that the burden then returns to the Complainant, to demonstrate that the explanation provided by the Respondent is a pretext for discriminatory conduct.\n[113] There are a variety of problems here. The case law seems to have neglected the origins of the prima facie test, which is used to decide whether there is a case to meet. The question is accordingly whether the responding party must lead evidence. This question arises more naturally at the close of the case for the Complainant and Commission than at the end of the case. If the Complainant and Commission have not established a prima facie case at this stage of the process, the Respondent has no reason to explain its conduct and is entitled to a non-suit. There is a related question as to whether the Respondent must decide whether to call evidence before applying for a non-suit.\n[114] The difficulty arises when the prima facie test is used at the end of the inquiry into a human rights complaint. This may seem feasible, as in O'Malley, when the Respondent has not led evidence. But it seems rather late in the process, if the purpose of the test is to determine whether there is a case to meet. This becomes apparent if the Respondent has called evidence, since it is redundant to ask whether the Respondent has an obligation to call evidence, if it has already done so.\n[115] There is a discussion of the meaning of a prima facie case in The Law of Evidence in Canada. The authors of this text begin by asserting that the idea is notoriously vague and can mean a number of things. They also make a distinction between an evidentiary and a legal burden of proof, which goes to the difference between raising a legal issue and proving a fact. The whole notion of a burden is somewhat misleading here, however, and I have to say that the discussion in the text only complicates the matter.\n[116] The dicta in O'Malley does not require that the Complainant and Commission prove the prima facie case in the normal sense of the word. This is in keeping with the practice in the courts, where the issue is merely whether the case should go to the jury and be considered by the court. This is apparent in the original passage from O'Malley, supra, at para. 28, which is quite tentative:\nA prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made, and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. (emphasis added)\nAs I understand it, the Tribunal is not called upon to decide whether it believes the case at this point in time. The issue in deciding whether there is a prima facie case, at least as it is set out in O'Malley, is merely whether the essentials of a case have been made out.\n[117] On this view, one would have thought that it is still open to the Tribunal to reject the evidence presented by the complaining parties and dismiss the case. I say this because the ordinary test for a prima facie case does not require that the evidence be weighed, at least in the normal run of cases. If the Tribunal simply moves to the Respondent's case, one of the normal steps in the normal process of weighing evidence is lost and the case for the Commission and Complainant is not subjected to an analysis on a balance of probabilities. This is a product of the decision to move the prima facie test from the close of the case for the Complainant and Commission to the end of the hearing.\n[118] There seem to be two possibilities. One is that this simply moves the burden of proving the case on a balance of probabilities from the complaining to the responding parties. As Justice McIntyre writes, rather starkly, in O'Malley: the Board of Inquiry was in error in fixing the Commission with the burden of proof. (\u00b628) The other possibility is that the burden shifts: that would mean that prima facie test employed at the end of a human rights inquiry is substantive and requires proof of the Complainant's case on a balance of probabilities. I am not sure that the matter is decided, though the idea of a shifting burden has been a source of concern in the courts. This is because it tends to obscure the ultimate burden of proof in a case, which normally rests with the party bringing the action.\n[119] I realize that the court in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 states that the burden shifts, but the case does not address the issue explicitly. I am inclined to think that the decision in O'Malley, at least, places the burden of proof in most cases of discrimination on the Respondent. There are reasons for this: it is the employer who is in the best position to prove undue hardship. I nevertheless find myself hesitating before I accept that the Supreme Court intended to alter the burden of proof in a case where this kind of issue does not come before the Tribunal. This takes me to the case before me, where the contest between the parties was remarkably simple.\n[120] The Complainant and Commission alleged that there was discrimination and harassment. The Respondent demurred. Although the prima facie test has been used in cases where there is an allegation that the Complainant was not awarded a position, this is on the basis that the employer had supervision of the competition and was privy to the decision-making process. This is not a significant consideration in the present case, where the only real issue is whether the Complainant and the Commission have established a credible case. This requires some weighing of the evidence.\n[121] The question is ultimately whether the burden of proof should be placed on the complaining or the responding parties, and whether the prima facie test should be used in a case where there seems no reason to apply it. In the final analysis, I do not feel that it is possible to go against the usual conventions of proof without more explicit direction from the courts. There is some support for this in O'Malley, again at paragraph 28, where Justice McIntyre says:\nI agree then with the Board of Inquiry that each case will come down to a question of proof, and therefore there must be a clearly-recognized and clearly-assigned burden of proof in these cases as in all civil proceedings. To whom should it be assigned? Following the well-settled rule in civil cases, the plaintiff bears the burden. He who alleges must prove.\nI cannot say whether the original motivation behind the conventional rule was to discourage litigation. This is not the place to deal with justifications, however, and the fundamental rule is too entrenched in the foundations of our legal system to be easily displaced.\n[122] I realize that this seems to create different burdens in different cases. If there is a simple allegation of discrimination and a simple denial, the burden remains on the Complainant and Commission. If the employer argues undue hardship, on the other hand, the burden seems to fall on the Respondent. I see no alternative, however, but to restrict myself to the case before me. The issue in the immediate case is not whether a prima facie case has been made out, which calls for a response. It is whether the Complainant and the Commission have proven their case. If the burden of proof actually shifts in a human rights case, this would seem to be a case where the evidence led by the Respondent goes to the first rather than the second burden.\n[123] I think my primary obligation is to clarify what approach I have followed, in assessing the evidence before me. In my view, then, the fundamental probative issue in the case before me is whether the Complainant and Commission have established on all of the evidence that there was discrimination or harassment. As I understand it, the evidence led by the Respondent was led for the purpose of negating such an inference and not for the purpose of proving a separate set of positive assertions. The only question for the Respondent is whether it has led sufficient evidence to offset any preponderance of evidence on the other side. Most of the issues in the case relate to the credibility of ordinary witnesses.\n[124] In these circumstances, I cannot see what purpose it serves to determine whether the Complainant and Commission have established a prima facie case in the circumstances before me. There is simply no need to go into such an inquiry: the issues between the parties lie in the merits of the case and the prefatory question simply does not pose itself. This does not prevent the Respondent from submitting, at least rhetorically, that the Complainant and Commission did not establish a prima facie case. This neither adds nor detracts from the task before me, however, which is to decide whether the Complainant and Commission have proven discrimination or harassment on a balance of probabilities.\nB. Discrimination [125] There are two complaints before me. The first alleges a pattern of discrimination against Mr. Hill. This pattern can be found in the assignment of tasks on the Dash-80 line, the allocation of temporary assignments, the decision to award the Planner III position to someone else, and the more general treatment of minorities in the shop.\n(i) The General Evidence [126] There was a general allegation of discrimination. Mr. Ash submitted that there were golden boys who were given the better job assignments and groomed for promotion. The mechanics who were members of visible minorities were excluded from this process, presumably by reason of race. The Complainant and Commission relied on the evidence of other witnesses, which provided circumstantial evidence of discrimination and harassment in the work place. Counsel referred to this as similar fact evidence. There was testimony from Carl Hibbert, for example, who felt that he had been discriminated against in applying for more senior positions.\n[127] I am not completely comfortable with the term similar fact evidence in this context, since I am not convinced that Mr. Hill's experiences were all that similar to those of other employees. There is no real evidence that Mr. Ryan, for example, displayed the same hostility to other mechanics that he displayed to Mr. Hill. The power plant was a large workplace and it is dangerous to generalize in this kind of way, at least in the present circumstances. The environment on the 737 line was clearly different than the environment on the Dash-80 line or in areas where minorities prevailed.\n[128] The case law nevertheless establishes that circumstantial evidence may be helpful in deciding whether there was discrimination. This is a product of the fact that direct evidence of discrimination is often difficult to obtain. In Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Chopra, [1998] F.C. No. 432, for example, Justice Richard held that statistical evidence regarding the distribution of minorities in the workplace could provide the basis for an inference that an individual Complainant was discriminated against. (1) Although I heard some evidence regarding the distribution of minorities at Canadian, Ms. Knorr testified that there were no reliable figures available, as the union discouraged employees from completing the relevant forms.\n[129] The decision in Chopra is still helpful, at para. 22, in establishing the importance of contextual evidence. At para. 22, Justice Richard holds that general evidence of a systemic problem is admissible as circumstantial evidence of discrimination. This goes well beyond on the admission of statistical evidence and encompasses the personal testimony of other employees who may have suffered from the same pattern of discrimination. It follows that general evidence of discrimination in the workplace may be helpful in determining whether there was evidence in a specific case.\n[130] The problem is that most of this evidence, in the present case, was vague and impressionistic. It consisted for the most part of personal opinions. It was also selective. This was apparent in the evidence of the training that was given to mechanics at Canadian. The training in question appears to have taken place prior to 1992, over ten years ago, and the evidence was sketchy. Although there may have been favouritism in deciding who received this training, it is very hard to judge from this distance whether there is any substance to such allegations. I can understand the suspicions of the Complainant and the Commission, but suspicion is not proof.\n[131] The Complainant and Commission may understandably feel that Canadian has benefited from its own failure to determine the number of minorities in its workforce. I am nevertheless willing to accept the impressionistic evidence that the representation of minorities in senior positions was notably sparse in the late eighties and early nineties. I am not, however, prepared to infer from this that Mr. Hill was discriminated against in his own attempts to advance in his career. I say this because the evidence as a whole establishes that the problems Mr. Hill encountered were a product of his own making.\n[132] The Commission has also cited Basi v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. 5029 (C.H.R.T.) and Holden v. Canadian National Railway (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. 12 (F.C.A.) as authorities for the principle that it is sufficient if race was one of the factors in what occurred to Mr. Hill. I accept this principle but do not find it helpful in the immediate case. In my view, the personality conflict that developed between Mr. Hill and Mr. Ryan was not a product of race, whatever racial views Mr. Ryan might have held. It was a product of Mr. Hill's attitude towards his work, his resentment of authority and his tendency to project his problems on to other people.\n[133] In the circumstances before me, I am not prepared to extend the experiences of other mechanics to the case of Mr. Hill. As the Tribunal held, in Swan v. Canada (Armed Forces) (1994) 25 C.H.R.R. 312, at para. 30, there must be a nexus between contextual evidence and the case before the Tribunal. I find myself in much the same position as the Tribunal in that case, which held that evidence of allegations by other individuals did not add to the Complainant's case. One must also exercise a certain caution in relying upon circumstantial evidence, particularly in cases where there are other explanations for what occurred.\n[134] This seems to bring in the rule from Hodge's case in the criminal courts, which holds that an individual cannot be convicted on circumstantial evidence unless the evidence is inconsistent with any other rational explanation. The Complainant and the Commission have provided me with an excerpt from Proving Discrimination in Canada, at p. 141f, where the author takes issue with an Ontario decision and argues that the rule is out of place in a case where the civil standard of proof applies.(2) I would hazard to suggest, however, that the origins of the test have more to do with the inherent fragility of circumstantial evidence than with the burden of proof.\n[135] I think it is enough in the present case to say that a tribunal should be reluctant to find against a respondent on the basis of circumstantial evidence when there is a reasonable alternative to the theory that the Complainant was discriminated or harassed. The general prejudicial effect of similar fact evidence is well recognized: although the rules of evidence have been relaxed in the context of human rights, the case law holds that such evidence is only admissible when its probative effect outweighs its prejudicial force. See: Mehta v. MacKay (1990), 15 C.H.R.R. 232 (N.S. App.Div.) and Hewstan v. Auchinlek (1997), 29 C.H.R.R. 309 (C.H.R.T.), at p. 313.\n[136] There is another issue that raises itself in the context of the general evidence of discrimination. Counsel submitted that the systemic issues in the workplace were brought to the company's attention when Mr. Hill filed his initial grievance. This gave rise to a general duty to rectify the situation. Although there were a number of investigations, the Complainant and the Commission took the position that the Respondent failed to treat the matter with the importance it deserved, or pursue it diligently. In the words of Mr. Fakirani, they kept dropping the ball.\n[137] I agree that the questions of discrimination and harassment were brought to the attention of the employer and raised a duty to investigate and correct any problems in the workplace. I do not agree, however, that the employer failed in its duty of due diligence. I accept that the attempts of the company to deal with these issues may have received less attention than some of the other issues in the workplace. They were nonetheless real and substantive. I accept the conclusions in the Ferguson-Rogers report, the decision of Arbitrator Ready, and Ms. Knorr's brief report on temporary assignments. I also think that the Complainant and Commission have overlooked the sincere attempts of the management to accommodate Mr. Hill after the incident of October 18th, 1994.\n[138] I should add that the employer has an obligation to provide a workplace free of discrimination and harassment, and this duty of due diligence extended to the larger issues in the workplace. The only complaints before me are the personal complaints of Mr. Hill, however, which originally took the form of grievances. The response to these grievances was by no means perfect: but it was more than sufficient, in my estimation, to satisfy the employer's obligation to deal with them diligently. I do not believe that there is any reason to discuss the principle of vicarious liability, which is not a significant issue in the present case.\n(ii) The Use of the Term Nig Nog\" [139] There is also an allegation that Mr. Ryan used the term nig nog in reference to Mr. Hill. As it turns out, however, the Oxford English Dictionary and the Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang give two meanings of the term. These meanings support both of the positions put forward by the parties. Mr. Ryan testified that the word is used in Lancashire to describe a foolish person. This appears to be the original use of the term and may be related to the word noggin. The racial use of the term appears to be a corruption of its original use, and refers to newcomers or immigrants who are not of the white race, undoubtedly acquiring some of its impact from its similarity to the word nigger. If Mr. Ryan was looking for an underhanded way of provoking Mr. Hill, he certainly succeeded.\n[140] I accept Mr. Hill's assertion that he told Mr. Ryan that the term was objectionable. There is no real evidence, however, other than the Complainant's, that Mr. Ryan used the word after it had been brought to his attention. I am prepared to accept Mr. Ryan's evidence that he stopped using the word. Although there is ample room for suspicion, I think it would be overstating the evidence to conclude that Mr. Ryan was using the term as a racial epithet. By all accounts, Mr. Ryan was a cautious man in his dealings with both his superiors and the mechanics on his crew. It would have been out of character for him to use explicit racial slurs, in addressing employees.\n(iii) Temporary Assignments [141] Then there is the allegation that Mr. Hill was discriminated against in the distribution of temporary assignments. In considering this aspect of the case, I feel obliged to say that it is not my place to decide how the workplace should be managed. That is the prerogative of management. There is no question that the distribution of work assignments within the machine shops was left in the discretion of individual foremen and was not based on a highly developed system. The Respondent argued that this was an inevitable aspect of the exigencies involved in the work done within the shops. There were clearly many situations in which the supervisory staff had to exercise their judgment in deciding the priority and distribution of work.\n[142] The Complainant and Commission have focused on the process used by Mr. Ryan in assigning mechanics to Area H. Mr. Ryan testified that he was routinely asked to send specific individuals to the blade rework area. I think this was an attempt to deflect responsibility, since there is no doubt that he had considerable input into those decisions. In those cases where he was expected to exercise his own discretion, he would assign those mechanics who were working on less pressing tasks. It was also apparent that he did not have a high regard for Mr. Hill's abilities as a mechanic and felt that the more important jobs were beyond him.\n[143] The Commission and Complainant have argued that a written record should have been kept of the temporary assignments. In their written argument, they submit as follows:\nThe Commission and the Complainant submit that the system cannot be adequately managed without written procedures and policies as to how to run that system, and written records in order to maintain updated information about the system. An unwritten system of work is of little comfort to employees who have nothing more to rely on them but the goodwill and memories of their supervisors. This type of system is arbitrary, and difficult to track. The Commission and the Complainant submit that such a system would actively hinder any sort of effort at ensuring work is allocated in a fair and equitable manner.\nI agree that a record should have been kept of the temporary assignments, at least in a case like the present, where the assignments were a source of controversy.\n[144] I would reject the idea, however, that all of the mechanics should have been assigned to the least desirable areas of the shop on an equal basis. This would undermine the foremen and supervisors, who have a right and indeed a duty to manage the shop in the best way they see fit. A foreman is entitled to keep his best mechanics on the most important or challenging tasks, and deploy less experienced and less capable mechanics in areas like balancing, viewing and blades. The safety of the airline industry enters into this. An employer is entitled to rely on the subjective assessment of a foreman, in determining the best distribution of mechanics in the workplace. It is not the job of the Tribunal to fine-tune these kinds of decisions, which are beyond its expertise.\n[145] This does not mean that an employer can discriminate against less experienced mechanics, who are entitled to the opportunities that they need to advance in their careers. The different interests must be balanced and the issue is whether there is concrete evidence that a foreman is taking advantage of the situation to favour some mechanics and punish others. A written record may be helpful in deciding this, but it is not determinative. There is no real dispute as to the number of times Mr. Hill was assigned to Area H, and since his situation was unique, I do not believe a list would have made any difference in my determination of the facts.\n[146] The ephemera of daily life takes on one meaning or the other, depending on the side that one adopts. Many of the mundane events of everyday life take on a sinister aspect, if one is inclined to view them in that manner. Mr. Hill testified, for example, that he was always given the dirty jobs, which required the use of lubricants and other unhealthy products. Mr. Radominski, on the other hand, testified that Mr. Hill did not like to get his hands dirty. As a result, he used the lubricants so sparingly that it was almost impossible to pry apart some of the components he had put together. This presented problems if the job had to be done over. The question that arises is whether Mr. Hill's contention was perception or reality.\n[147] I am not satisfied on all of the evidence that Mr. Hill was discriminated against in the distribution of temporary assignments. The evidence on this aspect of the case was even more speculative than the rest of the evidence. Many factors entered into these decisions, some of which can be attributed to Mr. Hill. I accept the evidence of a number of witnesses, for example, who suggested that Mr. Hill did not show as much initiative as some of the other mechanics. Rather than take up work, he would wait for assignments. This left him more vulnerable to the mercies of the foreman and more likely to be transferred off the line.\n[148] Although one of the purposes of the human rights process is to educate employers and employees, our constitution protects the freedom of conscience and it is not my place to regulate the private views of individual persons. I was not convinced by Mr. Ryan's avowal that he had no racial views. The evidence before me nevertheless suggests that he managed to keep them sufficiently to himself to protect the integrity of his decisions regarding the assignment of work. I cannot go beyond that. It is clear to me that Mr. Ryan was conscious of authority and would have known that his superiors were sensitive on the issue of discrimination.\n[149] The Respondent thought the method of allocating temporary work was well-tailored to meet the demands in the shop. Mr. Shelford felt that he had sincerely looked into the matter, in asking for Ms. Knorr's report, and came to the conclusion that the existing system of assigning jobs was fair and equitable. Mr. Strohmaier took a similar position. I cannot say that these conclusions were unreasonable. The engine shop could not have operated satisfactorily without temporary assignments. It was clear that there were times when the normal methods of assigning work had to be supplemented with a more ad hoc procedure.\nC. The Planner III Position [150] There is also Mr. Hill's application for the Planner III position. The basic requirements in proving that an employer discriminated against a complainant in awarding a position are set out in Shakes v. Rex Park (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 (Ont. Bd. of Inq.), at D\/1002:\nIn an employment complaint, the Commission usually establishes a prima facie case by proving (a) that the Complainant was qualified for the particular employment; (b) that the Complainant was not hired; and (c) that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint (i.e., race, color, etc.) subsequently obtained of the position. If these elements are prove, there is an evidentiary and onus on the Respondent to provide an explanation . . .\nThere is a no point in belabouring these kinds of issues in the present case. I am not satisfied, on the Planner III position, that the Complainant had the necessary qualifications for the position. I accept that he had the qualifications to apply for it: but the evidence of Mr. Clement and Mr. Hunter, in particular, establishes that he was a poor and inexperienced candidate.\n[151] The matter is complicated by the fact that the person who received the position did so on the basis that he did not appear to have the necessary qualifications. Mr. Hunter acknowledged the problem but it does not follow, in the circumstances of the case, that Mr. Hill was the victim of racial discrimination. The evidence demonstrates otherwise: aside from his lack of knowledge of the Planner III position, I have to say that Mr. Hill's attitude to his work, which surfaced in his interview, would probably have excluded him from more senior positions. I realize that he may see this as the cost of challenging an unresponsive management, but that is a partial view and I can only say that the problems with his general attitude to work were real.\nD. Harassment [152] There is no need to discuss the law of harassment at length. The Respondent has cited Dhanjal v. Air Canada (1996) 28 C.H.R.R. 367 (CHRT), (1996), aff'd at [1997] F.C.J. No. 1599 (F.C.A.), which holds that harassment must be persistent and frequent. The gravamen of harassment lies in the creation of a hostile work environment, which violates the personal dignity of the complainant. It poisons the workplace, deprives it of neutrality, and humiliates the person who is harassed. A person who harasses a complainant has failed to respect the fundamental dignity of the person.\n[153] The law establishes that there is a subjective and an objective component in harassment. As a result, as Dhanjal puts it, at para. 210, the seriousness of the impugned conduct must be perceived from the perspective of the victim. At the same time, the Tribunal must adopt the perspective of a reasonable victim. At paragraph 213, the Tribunal holds that:\nA number of factors may be weighed in assessing the reasonableness of the impugned conduct. In this regard, we share Mr. Pentney's opinion when he states the following, in the work he co-authored with Tarnopolsky, Discrimination and the Law (Toronto, De Boo, 1985 and cumulative supplements), at pp. 8-31 and 8-32:\nthe touchstone in applying this test must be the usual limits of social interaction in the circumstances....\nSeveral factors are relevant in evaluating the limits of reasonable social interaction, including the nature of the conduct at issue, the workplace environment, the pattern or type of prior personal interaction between the parties, and whether an objection or complaint has been made.\nThe present case takes me beyond these issues, since there is no question in my mind that the complainant breached the limits of reasonable interaction. This seems to be the decisive consideration in the immediate case.\n[154] There was a workplace harassment policy at Canadian. It was reasonably broad and stated that racial slurs and comments that intrude upon a person's or group's dignity would constitute harassment. This does not mean that the employer was obliged to maintain a pristine work environment. It was inevitable, given the antecedents, education and nature of the workforce, that the daily exchange between employees would include comments of a salacious or unduly vigorous nature. The testimony of Mr. Cavasin, even in the rather dignified confines of the courtroom, is a case in point. It was not a tea party.\n[155] Much has been made of the fact that the harassment policy co-ordinator was never formally appointed. Nor were harassment policy representatives. The employees in the engine shop were unaware that such a position existed and I agree that the harassment policy was never properly implemented. It does not follow, however, that Canadian defaulted on its obligations to prevent harassment in the workplace. I think it is more accurate to say that Canadian was struggling to meet all of its obligations, most of which related to the survival of the company. Ms. Knorr testified that she had played the role of the Policy Co-ordinator and dealt with specific issues when they arose. While the company's conduct was far from perfect, I am satisfied that there was a serious if limited attempt to deal with the racial issues in the workplace. The attempt to deal with Mr. Hill's complaints is a case in point. Whatever the problems within the process, I believe there was a sincere effort to deal with the substance of his complaints.\n[156] I do not want to go into estimates as to how much of the graffiti in the washrooms was racial in nature. It is enough to say that it was one of the themes that found expression on the walls. There is no evidence that graffiti was a serious problem elsewhere and there is evidence that the management took steps to control it. Not do I see any reason to discuss how often the bathrooms were painted. It is true that Mr. Shelford found himself unable to do this as often as he would like, as a result of budgetary restraints. But the point is that the management tried to deal with the matter. Mr. Shelford also testified that he addressed the issue at a meeting of the employees and discussed it with supervisors and foremen. The actions of the employer were serious and sincere.\n[157] In any event, the evidence in this regard goes to more systemic issues, where the better complaint seems to lie. Although this provides an important context, which is helpful in examining the origins of Mr. Hill's complaint, I have to say that it does not explain the series of events that finally culminated in the termination of his employment. This goes back to the question of a nexus. The evidence is overwhelming that the problems Mr. Hill experienced were of his own creation. The Respondent has stressed that the Complainant did not complain about the graffiti or the racial slurs until after he left Canadian and was compiling a case against it. I suspect that hindsight played a part in this, but I am not convinced that the Complainant was a particular target of racial improprieties.\n[158] Almost all of the evidence of personal harassment was provided by the Complainant. Mr. Hill testified that Gordy White, Bill Davidson, Herb Pierce and Mr. Ryan all used racial language or directed racial epithets at him. I do not accept that Mr. Ryan did so: the evidence regarding the other individuals, with the exception of Herb Pierce, was fragmented and unsupported. The only individual that was alleged to use derogatory racial comments towards Mr. Hill on the Dash-80 line was Mr. Pierce and there is no evidence that this was a general pattern among other mechanics. I have stated that it is clear to me that employees became considerably more sensitive to the issue over time.\n[159] Although I suspect that minorities were not treated with the respect and dignity that they deserve, I believe the problem was more general. The evidence establishes that many of the mechanics were not respectful of other employees. I include Mr. Hill in this. I am also satisfied that the problem was more acute as one goes back in time. There is no question that offensive comments were commonplace on the shop floor. Some of these were of a sexual nature; some of them were racial; and many scatological. It may be na\u00efvet\u00e9 on my part, but I was surprised at the general lack of respect that the mechanics displayed towards each other. It is evident from the testimony of a number of the mechanics that there was a good deal of baiting in the shop. This goes a long way toward explaining some of the more offensive forms of humour in the shop, which openly demeaned others.\n[160] Some of this may have been inevitable, given the antecedents, education and nature of the workforce. While there was evidence that the machine shops remained productive, there is little doubt that this aspect of the workplace was exacerbated by the prevailing uncertainty with regard to the future of the Airline. Ms. Knorr testified that this placed enormous pressure on everyone in the workplace. This does not excuse inappropriate conduct, but it provides the context in which such conduct must be measured. The decision in Dhami v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Comm.) (1989), 11 C.H.R.R. 253 (CHRT), at paragraph 80, suggests that factors such as the malaise brought about by the pressures of reorganization and integration may be relevant in assessing whether a complainant was a target of racially motivated behaviour.\n[161] It is manifest that the mechanics peppered their exchanges with whatever seemed offensive, in a rather adolescent attempt to subvert the normal standards of courtesy. There is evidence, for example, that a Chinese mechanic referred to himself as a chink. The idea was apparently to push the limits of civility as far as they would go, in a rather questionable form of sport. Mr. Hill participated in this aspect of the workplace, apparently with some gusto. I realize that the mechanic who was described as a dog-fucker on the rating performance record was one of the persons that allegedly made racial comments. It is also true that there is nothing racial in the comments on the form. These considerations seem beside the point, however, and Mr. Hill cannot conduct himself in this way and expect to come before the Tribunal when others do the same.\n[162] It is a blunt way of putting it, but the Complainant cannot object to conduct that he seemed to relish. This issue needs to be squarely faced. If Mr. Hill is offended by racial comments, but happy with cutting sexual remarks like piss flaps and dumb cunner, he was merely choosing his forms of disparagement. It is significant that there were women in the workplace. I accept Mr. Ghuman's testimony that Mr. Hill enjoyed using these terms, in the face of the individuals to which he was referring. This is a form of harassment, in itself, and undermines the dignity of the person. The situation before me is different than the situation in Swan v. Canada (Armed Forces), cited supra, where the Complainant acknowledged that he was not offended by some of the racial comments directed at him, which were used in a joking manner.\n[163] The Tribunal in Swan held that a Complainant's participation in racially offensive behaviour does not necessarily justify the behaviour. I agree that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable and in that sense, no amount of consent, can justify it. A distinction must be made between situations where someone feels compelled to participate in this kind of activity, however, against his inclinations, and a situation where he willingly does so. The obligation to respect the value and dignity of the person is reciprocal, and I think something like a doctrine of clean hands doctrine must apply in the field of human rights, at least in the context of personal complaints. The reputation of the human rights system would be undermined by a policy that rewarded complainants who violate the fundamental rights of other employees. There is a different set of considerations in systemic complaints.\n[164] The Respondent has submitted that there are some similarities between the present case and Dhanjal v. Air Canada, cited supra, where a personality conflict developed between the Complainant and his supervisor. There was testimony, as here, that the supervisor had real issues with the Complainant's work. The supervisor was described as an authoritarian manager who dealt with the employees underneath him in a high-handed way. I do not know if that is an accurate description of Mr. Ryan, but there is no question in my mind that authority was the real issue in the contest of wills that took place between Mr. Hill and Mr. Ryan. I am not prepared to say that there is no prima facie case before me, as the Tribunal did in Dhanjal. But the evidence from the Complainant is more in the nature of speculation than anything else and is thin by legal standards.\n[165] The Respondent has also directed me to Baptiste v. Canada (Correctional Service), [2001] (C.H.R.T.), where the Tribunal found itself unable to conclude that the Complainant's supervisor was motivated by race in giving her poor evaluations. There was a personality conflict between the Complainant and the supervisor, who became increasingly frustrated with her over time. There is a point, in these kinds of cases, where the perceptions of an employee become tainted with disaffection and even outright enmity. At that point, an employee feels victimized, and becomes thoroughly convinced that the problem is with the supervisor. In such a situation, it is only natural to project one's difficulties onto other people.\n[166] I am not questioning the sincerity of Mr. Hill's feelings. Since race was one of the defining features in the engine shop, with negative overtones, it comes as no surprise that it would provide him with a ready explanation for what occurred. This is not a case where I find it helpful to ask whether a reasonable person in Mr. Hill's position would have felt harassed. Mr. Hill's position was unique to himself and I am compelled to say that I do not believe that a person with a more reasonable attitude would have found himself in Mr. Hill's position. There was a certain amount of misfortune in the way that things developed in Mr. Hill's life and the events at work may have become the focus of more general issues. There is nothing I can say to that: but misfortune is not harassment.\n[167] The Complainant and Commission has suggested the circumstances in the present case bear some similarity to the facts set out in McKinnon v. Ontario (Ministry of Correctional Services)(No.3) (1988), 32 C.H.R.R. 1 (Ont. Bd. of Inq.) and Hinds v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission) (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. 5683. I simply do not agree: the problems in the present case can ultimately be traced to the Complainant rather than the employer. Any reasonable manager would have eventually come to the conclusion that Mr. Hill and Mr. Ryan needed to be separated, wherever the blame lay in their conflicting relations. In point of fact, Canadian recognized this at the meeting of the whole that was held to deal with the aftermath of the incident on October 18, 1994 and offered Mr. Hill another assignment. I do not find it reasonable for Mr. Hill to demand that Mr. Ryan be removed from the Dash-80 line.\nE. The Fundamental Nature of Human Rights [168] It is now recognized, in Canada and elsewhere, that the law of human rights has a fundamental character. I think it is significant, however, that it applies in the civil sphere. The Canadian Human Rights Act does not merely extend to government: it extends to the relationships between private individuals, which were traditionally outside such scrutiny. This naturally takes in the workplace: employees are entitled to a workplace that recognizes their inherent dignity and value, and an employer has a duty to prevent discrimination and harassment. This has been described in the case law as a term or condition of employment.\n[169] It follows that many of the complaints that come before Human Rights Tribunal arise in the workforce. This is as it should be. The Canadian Human Rights Act nevertheless deals with more fundamental interests and should not be merely seen as another level of appeal or review in the field of labour relations. I recognize that the complaints before me appear to invoke those interests. On closer examination, however, I have to say that the matter before me is primarily a personality conflict between an employee and supervisory staff. It raises serious workplace issues, which belong more in the field of labour relations than human rights.\n[170] There is some recognition of these concerns in the law of harassment. In Rampersandsingh v. Wignall, T.D. 13\/02; 2002\/11\/26, at para. 45, this Tribunal held that a certain seriousness was necessary to establish the gravamen of harassment. The Member in the case refers to Habachi v. Commission des droits de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec, [1999] R.J.Q. 2522, R.E.J.B. 1999-14361, [1999] J.Q. No. 4269 (Q.L.) (C.A.Q.), where the Quebec Court of Appeal held that the legal notion of harassment should not be rendered mundane, or banalis\u00e9, in the French, by opening up ordinary workplace disputes to the scrutiny of human rights tribunals. Something more is needed to invoke such fundamental rights.\n[171] There are similar concerns in the immediate case. A human rights complaint engages public interests that go beyond the private interests of the parties. The irony may be that Mr. Hill laid a more general complaint, which was not before me. I cannot say how that complaint might have been dealt with or whether it would have been substantiated, but it would at least go beyond the private dispute. Nor do I mean to discount the significance of what occurred to the participants. But I do not believe that the personal relations between Mr. Hill and Mr. Ryan raise the kind of fundamental issue that calls for examination in the present forum. The expertise of the Tribunal lies in human rights, rather than in management and labour issues.\n[172] In the immediate case, the allegation of discrimination really raised itself in the daily distribution of tasks on individual crews. These kind of complaints arise in any workplace and are easily overstated. It is impossible to scrutinize every aspect of the work assigned to individual employees, particularly when the events in question occurred over ten years ago. There is a certain critical mass, if I can put it that way, which is needed to justify a complaint. It was not present in the immediate case. I do not see the kind of public policy issue that one would expect to see in a case before a Human Rights Tribunal.\nIV. ORDER [173] In the circumstances, the Complainant and the Commission have not established on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Hill was discriminated against or harassed during the relevant period at Canadian. The complaints are therefore dismissed.\n[174] There is one incidental matter that I would like to mention. At the end of the hearing, I advised the parties that I would endeavour to issue my decision as soon as possible. I would like to express my regret that other matters intervened.\n\"Original signed by\"\nPaul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nFebruary 18, 2003\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE NO.: T677\/6501\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Yul F.

Grant Sinclair, pr\u00e9sident\nPierre Deschamps, membre\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur deux requ\u00eates. Une de ces requ\u00eates a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et l'autre, par le Syndicat canadien des communications, de l'\u00e9nergie et du papier (SCEP). L'une et l'autre requ\u00eate vise \u00e0 obtenir du Tribunal une ordonnance enjoignant Bell Canada de divulguer et de produire \u00e0 leur intention les documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans les avis de requ\u00eate. La Commission et le SCEP ont fait valoir que les documents en question pourraient \u00eatre pertinents \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des questions \u00e0 examiner en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[2] Bell s'est oppos\u00e9e aux deux requ\u00eates pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s.\nCes requ\u00eates, de par la port\u00e9e, leur ampleur et leur nature, sont ind\u00fbment on\u00e9reuses pour Bell, compte tenu du temps qu'il faudrait pour chercher les documents et des co\u00fbts que cette recherche impliquerait. La Commission et le SCEP ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part que les seuls documents sur lesquels ils se fonderaient pour pr\u00e9senter leur argumentation \u00e9taient les 74 documents produits dans le cadre de l'\u00e9tude conjointe que la Commission et le SCEP avaient choisis parmi la multitude de documents issus de cette m\u00eame \u00e9tude. Bell a dit s'\u00eatre fi\u00e9e \u00e0 cette affirmation pour pr\u00e9parer sa d\u00e9fense et mener ses contre-interrogatoires. En ordonnant la divulgation d'autres documents \u00e0 ce stade-ci de l'audience, on permettrait \u00e0 la Commission et au SCEP de modifier sensiblement leur preuve au d\u00e9triment de Bell; ils devraient \u00eatre irrecevables \u00e0 le faire ou r\u00e9put\u00e9s avoir renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 leur droit \u00e0 la divulgation d'autres documents. La Commission et le SCEP, sachant que Bell contestait la validit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tude conjointe aux fins de l'article 11 de la Loi, auraient d\u00fb raisonnablement pr\u00e9voir qu'ils auraient besoin de plus de 74 documents pour pr\u00e9senter leur cause. Aussi leur demande est-elle inopportune et pr\u00e9judiciable envers Bell.\n[3] La Commission et le SCEP ont constamment maintenu la position que leur cause repose sur l'\u00e9tude conjointe et qu'ils s'en remettraient aux 74 documents relatifs \u00e0 cette \u00e9tude qu'ils avaient identifi\u00e9s pour plaider leur cause.\n[4] L'instruction des plaintes devant ce Tribunal a d\u00e9but\u00e9 en janvier 1999. Le Tribunal a tranch\u00e9 un certain nombre de requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par Bell, de sorte que l'audience sur le fond des plaintes n'a commenc\u00e9 que le 17 avril 2000. La r\u00e8gle 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal exige que chaque partie donne un avis \u00e9crit relativement aux divers documents qu'elle a en sa possession et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toute question en cause. Aucune des parties n'a fait une telle divulgation ni demand\u00e9 au Tribunal \u00e0 quelque moment que ce soit de rendre une ordonnance \u00e0 cet effet.\n[5] L'audience sur le fond s'est poursuivie jusqu'au 2 novembre 2000, date o\u00f9 la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ordonn\u00e9 la suspension de l'instance en raison de la partialit\u00e9 institutionnelle du Tribunal. La proc\u00e9dure a repris le 10 septembre 2001, apr\u00e8s que la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale eut renvers\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance.\n[6] Le dossier indique que la Commission et le SCEP ont tous deux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des requ\u00eates en vue de la divulgation d'autres documents que les 74 documents relatifs \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude conjointe. Le 25 avril 2000, Bell a fourni \u00e0 la demande de la Commission les circulaires g\u00e9n\u00e9rales ayant rapport \u00e0 la question de l'effectif. Le 5 septembre 2001, le SCEP a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Bell les documents ayant trait aux donn\u00e9es sur l'effectif, les documents relatifs \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce HR-76 et les rapports ou analyses portant sur la fiabilit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tude conjointe que Bell a en main.\n[7] Durant la semaine d'audience du 22 janvier 2002, il est devenu \u00e9vident aux yeux du Tribunal que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui feraient partie de la preuve de chacune des parties n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement circonscrits. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, l'avocat de la Commission a dit au Tribunal qu'il n'avait aucune id\u00e9e de la teneur de la d\u00e9fense de Bell. L'avocat de Bell, pour sa part, a affirm\u00e9 que Bell ne connaissait pas la preuve de la Commission. En outre, l'avocat du SCEP a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que des demandes de divulgation \u00e9taient en suspens et qu'on devrait s'efforcer de les r\u00e9soudre par l'entremise des avocats, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi le SCEP demanderait au Tribunal une ordonnance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de divulgation.\n[8] Dans une tentative pour d\u00e9finir les points \u00e0 examiner et r\u00e9soudre les questions relatives \u00e0 la divulgation, le Tribunal, avec l'accord des parties, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 chacune d'elles de produire un m\u00e9moire indiquant les faits pertinents \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments juridiques que soul\u00e8ve l'affaire, les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 citer et les mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es. Le Tribunal, encore une fois avec l'accord des parties, n'a pas rendu d'ordonnance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de divulgation, laissant aux parties le soin de r\u00e9gler les questions de divulgation en toute bonne foi. S'il devait surgir un diff\u00e9rend en mati\u00e8re de divulgation, le Tribunal veillerait \u00e0 le trancher.\n[9] La Commission, l'ACET, le SCEP et Femmes-Action ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leur m\u00e9moire le 2 avril 2002 et Bell a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le sien le 13 mai 2002. Les parties ont poursuivi depuis lors leurs discussions au sujet de la divulgation des documents, mais elles n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s'entendre; d'o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sentation des deux requ\u00eates.\n[10] Sur la foi de la preuve, et eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ce que nous savons au sujet des questions en cause, nous avons conclu que les documents demand\u00e9s r\u00e9pondaient au crit\u00e8re de la pertinence possible, conclusion que Bell n'a pas s\u00e9rieusement contest\u00e9e.\n[11] En ce qui concerne le caract\u00e8re on\u00e9reux de la demande de divulgation, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des requ\u00eates indique que les documents demand\u00e9s se trouvent dans six \u00e0 huit classeurs situ\u00e9s dans les bureaux de Bell, au 1000, rue de la Gaucheti\u00e8re, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. En outre, l'avocat de Bell a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'on n'avait trouv\u00e9 aucune documentation relative au JEWC \u00e0 cet endroit. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'avocat de la Commission a retir\u00e9 la demande de divulgation visant les documents JEWC, \u00e0 moins que Bell, de sa propre initiative, puisse les d\u00e9nicher ailleurs. Dans les circonstances, l'avocat de Bell a admis que la recherche des documents qui se trouvent exclusivement au 1000, rue de la Gaucheti\u00e8re, ne constituerait pas une t\u00e2che trop on\u00e9reuse. Nous partageons cet avis.\n[12] Voil\u00e0 qui est suffisant \u00e0 notre avis pour trancher les deux requ\u00eates. La Commission et le SCEP ont demand\u00e9 la divulgation et la production des documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l'une et l'autre requ\u00eate. Nous ne voyons pas en quoi la divulgation porterait pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 Bell. Bell est libre de s'opposer \u00e0 la production des documents divulgu\u00e9s. Bell est libre de contester la recevabilit\u00e9 en preuve de l'un quelconque des documents divulgu\u00e9s ou produits. \u00c0 notre avis, les arguments de Bell au sujet de la renonciation, de la pr\u00e9clusion ou de la perspective raisonnable sont pr\u00e9matur\u00e9s.\nORDONNANCE Le Tribunal fait droit aux requ\u00eates et rend l'ordonnance suivante :\nBell dressera, de fa\u00e7on opportune et en d\u00e9ployant tous les efforts raisonnables, la liste de tous les documents qui se rapportent \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude conjointe et dont il est fait mention dans le t\u00e9moignage de Linda Benwell, documents qui se trouvent dans les classeurs dans les locaux de Bell Canada, situ\u00e9s au 1000, rue de la Gaucheti\u00e8re, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. La liste comprendra tout document relatif au processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois du JEWC ainsi que tout exemplaire imprim\u00e9 des communications \u00e9lectroniques, de la correspondance ou des documents pour la p\u00e9riode 1991-1993, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par Mich\u00e8le Boyer, Andr\u00e9 Beaudet, Matina Bisbicos ou Louise Belle-Isle. Si Bell ne trouve pas de documents touchant le JEWC dans ses bureaux du 1000, rue de la Gaucheti\u00e8re, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'est pas tenue de chercher ailleurs en vue de trouver de tels documents. Bell est seulement tenue de chercher les communications \u00e9lectroniques, la correspondance ou les documents qui se rapportent \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude conjointe et qui sont mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 1 ci-dessus. Bell doit faire parvenir \u00e0 la Commission et au SCEP la liste des documents mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 1 et, dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 Bell, de sa propre initiative, trouve des documents qui se rapportent au JEWC \u00e0 quelque autre endroit, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fournira \u00e0 la Commission et au SCEP la liste de ces documents. Bell produira les exemplaires de tous les documents indiqu\u00e9s sur les listes et qui sont mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 4, comme le lui ont demand\u00e9 la Commission et le SCEP. Bell fera \u00e9galement parvenir au SCEP les exemplaires des documents demand\u00e9s par le SCEP aux paragraphes 3j) et 3k) de son avis de requ\u00eate. Tout co\u00fbt excessif engag\u00e9 par Bell pour photocopier les documents mentionn\u00e9s aux paragraphes 5 et 6 seront acquitt\u00e9s par la Commission et le SCEP. L'audience pr\u00e9vue la semaine du lundi 13 janvier 2003 est report\u00e9e au lundi 27 janvier 2003. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 Bell conteste l'ordonnance de production de documents \u00e9nonc\u00e9e aux paragraphes 5 et 6 ci-dessus, le Tribunal, sur pr\u00e9sentation d'une requ\u00eate, entendra l'affaire \u00e0 compter du lundi 27 janvier 2003. Si Bell ne conteste pas l'ordonnance de production de documents, l'audience sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de l'affaire reprendra le 27 janvier 2003. Si Bell est dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de respecter l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier \u00e9tabli concernant la communication et la production de documents, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 devra en informer le Tribunal qui prendra une d\u00e9cision en cons\u00e9quence.

Durant sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi, il s\u2019est absent\u00e9 un grand nombre de jours, principalement pour cause de maladie. Dix-huit ans apr\u00e8s son embauche, l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour absent\u00e9isme chronique . Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en refusant de tenir compte de ses besoins et de continuer de l\u2019employer en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi ). La d\u00e9ficience en question r\u00e9side dans le syndrome de stress post-traumatique (d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e9galement sous l\u2019abr\u00e9viation SSPT ) et les d\u00e9sordres qui s\u2019y rattachent.\n[2] L\u2019employeur du plaignant au moment de la cessation de son emploi en 1996 \u00e9tait la Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d\u2019Ottawa-Carleton , qui exploitait le syst\u00e8me de transport en commun \u00e0 Ottawa (connu \u00e9galement sous le nom d\u2019 OC Transpo ). La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s le fait, ce m\u00eame organisme \u00e9tant nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9. En 2001, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 9 de la Loi de 1999 sur la ville d\u2019Ottawa, l\u2019exploitation d\u2019OC Transpo, y compris l\u2019ensemble de son actif et de son passif, a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la Ville d\u2019Ottawa fusionn\u00e9e[1]. Mme Lois Emburg, gestionnaire \u00e0 la Ville d\u2019Ottawa, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au cours de son t\u00e9moignage que cette derni\u00e8re accepte toute responsabilit\u00e9 qui pourrait \u00eatre attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Compte tenu de ses observations, la Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d\u2019Ottawa-Carleton doit continuer d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans cette instance. Cependant, il convient de noter que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi mentionn\u00e9e ci\u2011dessus, l\u2019organisme intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissout le 1er janvier 2001.\nI. LES FAITS [3] La plupart des faits ne sont pas contest\u00e9s. Toutes les parties admettent que durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (environ dix-huit ans et deux mois), le plaignant s\u2019est absent\u00e9 quelque 1 664 journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes et 33 parties de journ\u00e9e. Ses absences \u00e9taient surtout imputables \u00e0 la maladie. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas le fait que le plaignant \u00e9tait vraiment malade.\nA. Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019emploi du plaignant aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [4] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e comme chauffeur d\u2019autobus en novembre 1977. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de stage. Les dossiers de l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est inqui\u00e9t\u00e9e d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du degr\u00e9 d\u2019absent\u00e9isme du plaignant, avec le r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019elle a prolong\u00e9 de trois mois sa p\u00e9riode de probation en janvier 1979. En septembre 1979, le plaignant a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu pendant plusieurs jours pour cause d\u2019absent\u00e9isme, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit quant \u00e0 la nature des maladies ou aux causes qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 les absences du plaignant dans les d\u00e9buts. Le plaignant reconna\u00eet qu\u2019on l\u2019a vite inform\u00e9 que l\u2019absent\u00e9isme chronique au sein de l\u2019effectif d\u2019OC Transpo \u00e9tait un sujet permanent de pr\u00e9occupation pour l\u2019employeur.\n[5] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements de sa vie qui auraient contribu\u00e9 au syndrome de stress post-traumatique dont il a souffert ult\u00e9rieurement. En 1979, sa relation avec une femme \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait fianc\u00e9 a pris fin abruptement. Bien qu\u2019elle ait eu sur lui un effet d\u00e9sastreux, cette rupture n\u2019a pas entra\u00een\u00e9 d\u2019absences du travail. En octobre 1980, la m\u00e8re du plaignant est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e du cancer. Il a \u00e9galement qualifi\u00e9 cette perte de d\u00e9sastreuse, faisant remarquer qu\u2019il entretenait avec elle une relation tr\u00e8s \u00e9troite. Il a alors pris les trois jours de cong\u00e9 de d\u00e9c\u00e8s accord\u00e9s aux termes de la convention collective.\n[6] Quelques mois plus tard, en d\u00e9cembre 1980, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une violente agression alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au volant de son autobus. Un passager en tenue de corv\u00e9e militaire et coiff\u00e9 d\u2019un passe-montagne est mont\u00e9 dans l\u2019autobus et lui a ass\u00e9n\u00e9 sans avertissement un coup au c\u00f4t\u00e9 du visage, lui faisant perdre conscience. Le plaignant a re\u00e7u des soins \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, qui lui a donn\u00e9 son cong\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019une semaine plus tard qu\u2019il est retourn\u00e9 au travail.\n[7] Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au sujet du dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 du plaignant au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 80; toutefois, la Commission et lui ont reconnu qu\u2019il travaillait de fa\u00e7on intermittente . Les fiches de pr\u00e9sence du plaignant pour 1984 et les ann\u00e9es suivantes ont n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 produites. En 1984, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent pendant toute la p\u00e9riode comprise entre mars et le d\u00e9but de septembre. La fiche de pr\u00e9sence indique qu\u2019il recevait des indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019accident du travail durant cette p\u00e9riode; cependant, aucune explication n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie \u00e0 l\u2019audience quant \u00e0 la nature ou \u00e0 la cause de sa maladie ou de sa d\u00e9ficience. En 1985, le plaignant s\u2019est absent\u00e9 du travail pour cause de maladie pendant treize journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes et quatre parties de journ\u00e9e. En 1986, il s\u2019est absent\u00e9 pendant trente journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes et une partie de journ\u00e9e.\n[8] En 1987, le p\u00e8re du plaignant est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 subitement. Le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que cette perte l\u2019avait \u00e9galement beaucoup afflig\u00e9. Il a alors b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 du cong\u00e9 de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de trois jours. En 1987, il s\u2019est absent\u00e9 quarante-deux journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes et quatre parties de journ\u00e9e, pour cause de maladie. En 1988, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent du travail vingt-huit journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes et sept parties de journ\u00e9e.\n[9] Le 7 mars 1989, la direction a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant pour discuter avec lui de son degr\u00e9 d\u2019absent\u00e9isme. Comme si la malchance le poursuivait, un autre incident troublant s\u2019est produit \u00e0 peine deux semaines plus tard pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au travail. Un passager de sexe masculin est mont\u00e9 \u00e0 bord de son autobus et s\u2019est mis \u00e0 crier apr\u00e8s lui. Il est finalement descendu du v\u00e9hicule; cependant, un nouvel affrontement est survenu entre les deux hommes deux jours plus tard. L\u2019individu en question s\u2019est approch\u00e9 du plaignant alors que celui\u2011ci \u00e9tait debout pr\u00e8s de son autobus au point de d\u00e9part de son trajet. L\u2019homme qui avait une main dans sa poche s\u2019est mis \u00e0 prof\u00e9rer au plaignant des menaces de mort. Deux autres chauffeurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moins de l\u2019incident; l\u2019un d\u2019eux a appel\u00e9 un superviseur qui a pri\u00e9 l\u2019individu de monter \u00e0 bord d\u2019un autre autobus sans toutefois \u00e9tablir de rapport ni appeler la police. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que le passager lui avait vraiment fait peur et qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait senti [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s vuln\u00e9rable et en danger \u00e0 cause de la mani\u00e8re dont son employeur avait trait\u00e9 la menace.\n[10] Bien qu\u2019il ne se soit pas absent\u00e9 du travail \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ces incidents se sont produits, le plaignant a multipli\u00e9 les absences dans les semaines et les mois qui ont suivi. Le 18 juillet 1989, l\u2019employeur l\u2019a convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue pour lui parler de son absent\u00e9isme. Le plaignant se souvient qu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ressentir des [TRADUCTION] maux d\u2019estomac et \u00e0 se sentir [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 la suite des incidents de mars. Il s\u2019est alors absent\u00e9 du travail de d\u00e9cembre 1989 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 1990; d\u2019apr\u00e8s ses certificats m\u00e9dicaux, il souffrait surtout de troubles gastro-intestinaux. Il a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au d\u00e9but de mars 1990, puis s\u2019est \u00e0 nouveau absent\u00e9 \u00e0 compter du 21 mars 1990. \u00c0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, son absence a dur\u00e9 199 jours. Durant cette p\u00e9riode, il a re\u00e7u des indemnit\u00e9s de la Commission des accidents du travail, sa d\u00e9ficience \u00e9tant pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment li\u00e9e au traumatisme caus\u00e9 par les menaces de mort prof\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 son endroit. Les certificats m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9mis par son m\u00e9decin de famille au cours de cette p\u00e9riode font mention d\u2019un \u00e9tat anxieux , de stress professionnel et d\u2019une r\u00e9action d\u2019adaptation .\n[11] Alors que le plaignant \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 en 1990, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne professionnelle d\u2019OC Transpo (le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne ) communiquait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement avec lui pour s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et de la date \u00e0 laquelle il pr\u00e9voyait revenir au travail. Selon la preuve produite par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne avait notamment pour r\u00f4le de recueillir des renseignements au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s en cong\u00e9 de maladie et d\u2019informer les divisions o\u00f9 ils travaillaient (les divisions employeuses ) de la date pr\u00e9vue de leur retour au travail. Le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne devait \u00e9galement d\u00e9terminer si une all\u00e9gation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 non professionnelle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, compte tenu des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux disponibles. L\u2019\u00e9quipe du Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e de plusieurs infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers \u00e0 temps plein ainsi que d\u2019un m\u00e9decin qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019intim\u00e9e mais \u00e0 qui on demandait parfois une opinion. Les activit\u00e9s du Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne faisaient partie int\u00e9grante du programme mis en place par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour g\u00e9rer les pr\u00e9sences de ses employ\u00e9s (le Programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences ). Le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sur pied notamment pour prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux des employ\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne divulguait jamais \u00e0 la direction de d\u00e9tails relativement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d\u2019un employ\u00e9. Il se contentait de fournir aux divisions employeuses des conclusions et opinions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019employ\u00e9 de reprendre le travail.\n[12] Le 14 d\u00e9cembre 1990, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne, sur la foi des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux recueillis aupr\u00e8s du plaignant et de son m\u00e9decin, a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le plaignant serait en mesure de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions habituelles \u00e0 compter du 2 janvier 1991, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il pourrait travailler au d\u00e9but quatre heures par jour plut\u00f4t que huit. On qualifiait cette activit\u00e9 transitoire de conditionnement au travail . Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 ce r\u00e9gime de travail modifi\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au 25 f\u00e9vrier 1991, date \u00e0 compter de laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau en cong\u00e9 de maladie, souffrant de douleurs au dos et \u00e0 l\u2019abdomen, selon les certificats m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[13] En avril 1991, le m\u00e9decin de famille du plaignant en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le plaignant [TRADUCTION] \u00e9tait hant\u00e9 par la crainte d\u2019\u00eatre agress\u00e9 pendant son travail au point d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e8s d\u2019un \u00e9tat de d\u00e9lire . Il a apparemment conclu que le plaignant \u00e9tait atteint du syndrome de stress post-traumatique et a, par cons\u00e9quent, inform\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e que le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore en mesure de retourner au travail. Il a alors dirig\u00e9 le plaignant vers l\u2019H\u00f4pital Royal d\u2019Ottawa en vue d\u2019une \u00e9valuation psychiatrique. Le 17 mai 1991, le Dr Hamilton Sequeira, un psychiatre, a examin\u00e9 le plaignant puis a pos\u00e9 le diagnostic provisoire suivant : [TRADUCTION] syndrome de stress post-traumatique de longue date, accompagn\u00e9 de sympt\u00f4mes anxieux, d\u00e9pressifs et somatiques . Dans son rapport de diagnostic, le Dr Sequiera a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019agression de 1980 et aux menaces de 1989 ainsi qu\u2019aux d\u00e9c\u00e8s subits des parents du plaignant. Le m\u00e9decin de famille du plaignant a \u00e9tabli un nouveau certificat m\u00e9dical indiquant que le plaignant serait en cong\u00e9 de maladie pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Le plaignant a re\u00e7u des indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019accident du travail durant ce cong\u00e9 de maladie prolong\u00e9.\n[14] Le Dr Sequiera a recommand\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode th\u00e9rapeutique faisant appel \u00e0 des m\u00e9dicaments et \u00e0 la th\u00e9rapie cognitivo-comportementale afin [TRADUCTION] de le d\u00e9sensibiliser en dissipant les concepts et sentiments n\u00e9gatifs d\u00e9coulant du traumatisme subi . \u00c0 cette fin, le Dr Sequiera a demand\u00e9 l\u2019aide du Dr David Erickson, Ph. D., psychologue agr\u00e9\u00e9, qui faisait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque un stage en vue de devenir psychologue clinicien, titre qu\u2019il a obtenu en 1994. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Erickson a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la th\u00e9rapie cognitivo-comportementale comporte deux volets : le volet comportemental et le volet cognitif. Le volet comportemental consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9composer en petites \u00e9tapes la peur que ressent le sujet. On passe au volet cognitif une fois qu\u2019on a fait certains progr\u00e8s sur le plan comportemental. Le volet cognitif consiste pour l\u2019individu \u00e0 tenter d\u2019imaginer \u00e0 l\u2019avance les activit\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019origine de son \u00e9tat anxieux.\n[15] Le Dr Erickson a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 traiter le plaignant le 4 novembre 1991. Il a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait un bon candidat \u00e0 la th\u00e9rapie cognitivo-comportementale. Entre novembre 1991 et ao\u00fbt 1992, le Dr Erickson a re\u00e7u le plaignant chaque semaine. Il a tenu le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne au courant des progr\u00e8s. Dans le rapport d\u2019expert qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au moment de son t\u00e9moignage dans cette instance, il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019en juillet 1992, apr\u00e8s huit mois de th\u00e9rapie cognitivo-comportementale jumel\u00e9e \u00e0 la prise de m\u00e9dicaments, l\u2019\u00e9tat du plaignant s\u2019\u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] \u00e9norm\u00e9ment am\u00e9lior\u00e9 et que celui\u2011ci [TRADUCTION] \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 faire un retour progressif au travail . Le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne et les Drs Sequeira et Erickson ont convenu que, dans le cadre de cette transition au travail \u00e0 temps plein, le plaignant commencerait par conduire ce qu\u2019on appelait le [TRADUCTION] bus-navette du CESEH . L\u2019acronyme CESEH d\u00e9signait le Comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen de la situation des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s, qui \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants des employ\u00e9s et de la direction d\u2019OC Transpo. Le CESEH avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e afin d\u2019aider \u00e0 la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s au sein de l\u2019effectif. Le bus-navette du CESEH \u00e9tait en fait un minibus qui servait uniquement \u00e0 transporter \u00e0 divers endroits les chauffeurs d\u2019OC Transpo qui devaient prendre la rel\u00e8ve de coll\u00e8gues. Les seuls passagers \u00e0 bord du mini-bus \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s d\u2019OC Transpo.\n[16] Le plaignant a conduit ce v\u00e9hicule entre la mi\u2011juillet et la mi\u2011septembre 1992, apr\u00e8s quoi il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime de travail modifi\u00e9 (quatre heures par jour), conduisant les autobus ordinaires d\u2019OC Transpo utilis\u00e9s pour le transport des passagers. Selon le Dr Erickson, le plaignant \u00e9tait \u00e0 la mi\u2011octobre 1992 [TRADUCTION] asymptomatique et \u00e0 nouveau en mesure de fonctionner normalement . Le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne a donc indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la division employeuse que le plaignant serait en mesure d\u2019exercer \u00e0 temps plein ses fonctions habituelles \u00e0 compter du 14 octobre 1992.\n[17] Entre le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1992 et le 14 janvier 1993, le plaignant s\u2019est absent\u00e9 pendant treize journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes et deux parties de journ\u00e9e pour cause de maladie, parce qu\u2019il souffrait de vision trouble, d\u2019\u00e9tourdissements, d\u2019insomnie et de gastro-ent\u00e9rite. Lors de son entretien du 14 d\u00e9cembre 1992 avec le plaignant, le Dr Erickson a constat\u00e9 que son probl\u00e8me d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 avait refait surface, en partie parce qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 certains des trajets qu\u2019il craignait le plus avant son traitement. Le Dr Sequeira lui a alors prescrit des m\u00e9dicaments et le Dr Erickson lui a fix\u00e9 des rendez-vous p\u00e9riodiques.\n[18] Malheureusement, le 15 janvier 1993, l\u2019autobus que conduisait le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 percut\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re par un autre v\u00e9hicule, avec le r\u00e9sultat que le plaignant a subi un coup de fouet (entorse du rachis cervical). Selon son m\u00e9decin de famille, le plaignant \u00e9tait tellement mal en point qu\u2019il ne pourrait retourner au travail avant mai 1993. Dans son rapport d\u2019expert, le Dr Erickson a indiqu\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s frustr\u00e9 de ne pouvoir travailler \u00e0 cause de cet accident tout en pr\u00e9cisant que certains troubles gastro-intestinaux et maux de t\u00eate dont il souffrait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque \u00e9taient probablement li\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat de d\u00e9tresse. Cependant, le Dr Erickson a indiqu\u00e9 que son patient ne pr\u00e9sentait pas \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 de sympt\u00f4mes (troubles anxieux, probl\u00e8mes d\u2019humeur ou troubles du sommeil) donnant \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il subsistait des s\u00e9quelles du syndrome de stress post-traumatique.\n[19] Apr\u00e8s une absence totale de 92 jours ouvrables \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019accident de travail qu\u2019il avait subi (coup de fouet), le plaignant a r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 ses fonctions normales au d\u00e9but de juin 1993. En ao\u00fbt 1993, il a pris au total six journ\u00e9es et une partie de journ\u00e9e en cong\u00e9s de maladie. Selon le certificat m\u00e9dical qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, il souffrait [TRADUCTION] d\u2019angoisse profonde . En octobre 1993, le plaignant souffrait de troubles majeurs du sommeil et a d\u00fb prendre un autre cong\u00e9 qui devait durer jusqu\u2019en juin 1994.\n[20] Le plaignant ne dormait plus que deux \u00e0 trois heures par nuit. Le Dr Sequeira l\u2019a alors dirig\u00e9 vers un psychiatre sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans les troubles du sommeil, qui lui a prescrit des m\u00e9dicaments pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 dormir et emp\u00eacher les mouvements de jambes p\u00e9riodiques qui le r\u00e9veillaient pendant son sommeil. En mai 1994, ce psychiatre a jug\u00e9 que les probl\u00e8mes de sommeil \u00e9taient [TRADUCTION] maintenant r\u00e9gl\u00e9s et il a \u00e9mis l\u2019opinion que le plaignant \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 retourner au travail.\n[21] Le 27 mai 1994, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne a transmis \u00e0 la division employeuse une note indiquant que le pronostic \u00e9tait que le plaignant pourrait [TRADUCTION] se pr\u00e9senter au travail de fa\u00e7on assidue . Cette note pr\u00e9cisait qu\u2019un m\u00e9decin (non nomm\u00e9) qui soignait le plaignant avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical \u00e9tait r\u00e9solu et [TRADUCTION] ne devrait pas lui causer de probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 l\u2019avenir . En outre, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 par le m\u00e9decin externe du Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa note qu\u2019il avait constat\u00e9 que l\u2019attitude du plaignant \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s positive, plus positive en fait que lors des \u00e9valuations qu\u2019il avait lui-m\u00eame faites en 1992 et 1993.\n[22] Le plaignant a donc repris son travail normal le 2 juin 1994. Peu apr\u00e8s, alors qu\u2019il conduisait son autobus, plusieurs adolescents se sont adress\u00e9s \u00e0 lui d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il a per\u00e7ue comme mena\u00e7ante. Il a eu peur et s\u2019est senti vuln\u00e9rable comme une personne traqu\u00e9e qu\u2019on tente d\u2019attaquer. Il a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 souffrir d\u2019insomnie et s\u2019est alors mis \u00e0 prendre de plus fortes doses de son m\u00e9dicament pour dormir. Il en a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 des \u00e9tourdissements qui l\u2019ont emp\u00each\u00e9 de bien faire son travail. Le 5 juin 1994, le surintendant du personnel op\u00e9rationnel, M. Ron Mooney, ayant constat\u00e9 que le plaignant avait les facult\u00e9s affaiblies, lui a demand\u00e9 de cesser de conduire son autobus. Plusieurs jours plus tard le surintendant a adress\u00e9 au Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne une note demandant qu\u2019on r\u00e9\u00e9value l\u2019\u00e9tat du plaignant afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il \u00e9tait en mesure de reprendre le travail \u00e0 temps plein.\n[23] En juillet 1994, le Dr Sequeira avait r\u00e9activ\u00e9 tous les traitements psychiatriques. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se faire soigner par le Dr Erickson. Apr\u00e8s quelques semaines, le Dr Sequeira a constat\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait tellement d\u00e9prim\u00e9, anxieux et priv\u00e9 de sommeil qu\u2019il fallait l\u2019admettre \u00e0 l\u2019Unit\u00e9 des troubles de l\u2019humeur de l\u2019H\u00f4pital Royal d\u2019Ottawa. On lui a alors diagnostiqu\u00e9 une d\u00e9pression profonde, des troubles du sommeil et une anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e. Il a re\u00e7u son cong\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital le 20 septembre 1994. En juin 1995, ses probl\u00e8mes de d\u00e9pression et de sommeil \u00e9taient r\u00e9gl\u00e9s.\n[24] Alors que ces probl\u00e8mes se r\u00e9sorbaient, les sympt\u00f4mes du syndrome de stress post-traumatique ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9appara\u00eetre. Son [TRADUCTION] comportement d\u2019\u00e9vitement \u00e9tait une manifestation de sa peur d\u2019\u00eatre agress\u00e9 et s\u2019accompagnait de flash-backs r\u00e9currents pendant le jour. Le Dr Erickson a alors d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 un autre programme de th\u00e9rapie cognitivo-comportementale pour le plaignant. Selon le Dr Erickson, une partie de cette th\u00e9rapie \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s exigeante pour le plaignant, car elle lui faisait revivre la crainte d\u2019\u00eatre quotidiennement agress\u00e9. De l\u2019avis du Dr Erickson, la th\u00e9rapie a donn\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats escompt\u00e9s, tant et si bien que le syndrome de stress post-traumatique avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] vaincu en f\u00e9vrier 1996 (le mois o\u00f9 le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9).\nB. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus au cours des mois qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le cong\u00e9diement du plaignant [25] Le 26 octobre 1995, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant en entrevue, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique qui exigeait de rencontrer p\u00e9riodiquement les employ\u00e9s qui recevaient des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e. Sur la foi des observations du plaignant ainsi que des renseignements obtenus aupr\u00e8s de ses m\u00e9decins, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le plaignant esp\u00e9rait r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions normales de chauffeur d\u2019autobus. Selon une note r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne apr\u00e8s la rencontre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 le plaignant que son poste n\u2019\u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9 que pour une p\u00e9riode de 24 mois apr\u00e8s la date du d\u00e9but des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e. Cette p\u00e9riode devait prendre fin le 2 f\u00e9vrier 1996. S\u2019il ne r\u00e9int\u00e9grait pas ses fonctions ou n\u2019\u00e9tait pas affect\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches chez OC Transpo d\u2019ici l\u00e0, l\u2019intim\u00e9e prendrait une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 son [TRADUCTION] statut permanent et [TRADUCTION] selon toute vraisemblance [\u2026] mettrait fin \u00e0 son emploi pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales .\n[26] Le 13 d\u00e9cembre 1995, le Dr Sequeira a rempli un formulaire destin\u00e9 au minist\u00e8re des Transports de l\u2019Ontario. Le permis de conduire de classe C du plaignant, qui lui permettait de conduire des autobus, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9class\u00e9 en raison de son invalidit\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e. Afin qu\u2019il puisse obtenir \u00e0 nouveau le permis requis, il fallait qu\u2019un m\u00e9decin fasse rapport de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Le Dr Sequeira a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sur le formulaire que le plaignant pouvait recouvrer son permis, car il avait [TRADUCTION] fait beaucoup de progr\u00e8s par rapport \u00e0 la symptomatologie de hantise-anxi\u00e9t\u00e9-\u00e9vitement-d\u00e9pression associ\u00e9e \u00e0 son syndrome de stress post-traumatique .\n[27] Le 31 janvier 1996, les Drs Sequeira et Erickson ont sign\u00e9 une lettre qu\u2019ils avaient r\u00e9dig\u00e9e conjointement et qui \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e au Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne d\u2019OC Transpo. Dans cette lettre, ils d\u00e9claraient ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nAlain est actuellement dans les derni\u00e8res phases de son traitement. Dans quelques semaines, la [th\u00e9rapie cognitivo-comportementale] visant \u00e0 dissiper son \u00e9tat anxieux post-traumatique sera suffisamment avanc\u00e9e pour lui permettre de retourner au travail en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Les stimuli anxiog\u00e8nes (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., v\u00eatements port\u00e9s par son agresseur) ne susciteront plus d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 incapacitante. Alain ne sera alors en proie qu\u2019\u00e0 de l\u00e9gers tremblements.\nDe m\u00eame, ses troubles du sommeil sont bien contr\u00f4l\u00e9s. Il continue de faire des cauchemars attribuables \u00e0 son \u00e9tat anxieux, mais ceux\u2011ci ne sont pas graves au point de l\u2019emp\u00eacher de dormir. Cependant, il \u00e9prouve encore de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se r\u00e9veiller le matin : une fois qu\u2019il aura pu s\u2019adapter graduellement \u00e0 une routine quotidienne structur\u00e9e, la situation redeviendra normale.\nEnfin, Alain n\u2019a plus de baisses d\u2019humeur. Au cours du mois \u00e9coul\u00e9, il a eu deux ou trois \u00e9pisodes de dysphorie l\u00e9g\u00e8re d\u2019une \u00e0 deux heures chacun par semaine. Il n\u2019a pas eu de baisse d\u2019humeur soutenue au cours du mois \u00e9coul\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019humeur d\u2019Alain se situe nettement \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des limites normales.\nLes Drs Sequiera et Erickson ont ensuite d\u00e9crit les m\u00e9dicaments prescrits au plaignant, faisant remarquer qu\u2019ils n\u2019entraveraient pas sa capacit\u00e9 de conduire un autobus d\u2019OC Transpo. Ils ont \u00e9galement fait observer que le plaignant continuerait de consulter l\u2019un et l\u2019autre sp\u00e9cialiste au cours des mois \u00e0 venir, ne serait\u2011ce que pour surmonter tout reliquat d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et v\u00e9rifier l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des m\u00e9dicaments. Vers la fin de la lettre, ils ont formul\u00e9 les conclusions suivantes :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00c0 ce moment\u2011ci, il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable pour la sant\u00e9 d\u2019Alain qu\u2019il puisse d\u2019abord exercer ses fonctions \u00e0 temps partiel afin qu\u2019il puisse se conditionner progressivement au travail \u00e0 temps plein. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9adaptation, il serait contre-indiqu\u00e9 de lui faire faire de longues journ\u00e9es de travail, car cela risquerait de perturber son sommeil. Nous vous saurions gr\u00e9 de bien vouloir nous consulter lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agira d\u2019accro\u00eetre graduellement les fonctions d\u2019Alain, car l\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans son cas d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il ne faut pas pr\u00e9cipiter les choses.\nEn somme, le pronostic est tr\u00e8s bon. Alain a travaill\u00e9 fort pour surmonter ses troubles de l\u2019humeur et adopter une attitude positive et constructive, avec le r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019il se situe actuellement \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des limites normales. Son \u00e9tat anxieux li\u00e9 au SSPT s\u2019est beaucoup dissip\u00e9 et ne nuira pas \u00e0 son rendement comme chauffeur.\n(C\u2019est moi qui souligne)\n[28] Plusieurs jours avant la date limite du 2 f\u00e9vrier 1996 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait fix\u00e9e, le plaignant a communiqu\u00e9 avec l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re chef du Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne pour discuter de son retour au travail. L\u2019infirmi\u00e8re chef lui a alors simplement dit de se pr\u00e9senter au travail le jour en question et de voir M. Mooney, le surintendant du personnel op\u00e9rationnel. Le plaignant s\u2019est donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mooney. Il lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 reprendre le travail tout en pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il devait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de certaines mesures d\u2019adaptation pour faciliter sa transition, conform\u00e9ment aux recommandations de son psychiatre et de son psychologue. M. Mooney a inform\u00e9 le plaignant qu\u2019on ne prendrait pas \u00e0 son endroit de mesures d\u2019adaptation de ce genre pour permettre un conditionnement au travail. Lorsque le plaignant a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre emploi chez OC Transpo, M. Mooney lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait rien pour lui. En fait, M. Mooney a dit au plaignant que son dossier faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate et qu\u2019il serait inform\u00e9 du r\u00e9sultat deux semaines plus tard. Le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant au sujet de ces rencontres n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit. Ni l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re chef ni M. Mooney n\u2019a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[29] Le 6 f\u00e9vrier 1996, M. Mooney a \u00e9crit au Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne pour demander si les affections dont souffrait le plaignant et pour lesquelles il venait de recevoir des soins \u00e9taient les m\u00eames que celles pour lesquelles un pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni en mai 1994. Il a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 si le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne \u00e9tait persuad\u00e9, sur la foi des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, que le plaignant devrait r\u00e9int\u00e9grer son poste de chauffeur d\u2019autobus, une fois son permis renouvel\u00e9. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse en date du 9 f\u00e9vrier 1996, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux avis r\u00e9cents obtenus des Drs Sequiera et Erickson selon lesquels le plaignant pouvait recommencer \u00e0 travailler, mais ce \u00e0 temps partiel de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer graduellement \u00e0 pouvoir exercer ses fonctions \u00e0 temps plein. Toutefois, la note du Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne se terminait par l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 suivant :\n[TRADUCTION]\nEu \u00e9gard aux renseignements m\u00e9dicaux qui figurent actuellement au dossier, du fait que M. Parisien ne d\u00e9tient pas \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle de permis de classe C et de son dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne n\u2019est pas enti\u00e8rement persuad\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment\u2011ci qu\u2019il sera en mesure d\u2019exercer de fa\u00e7on assidue ses fonctions de chauffeur d\u2019autobus.\nSi la Division du transport [la division employeuse du plaignant] est en mesure d\u2019offrir \u00e0 M. Parisien un autre emploi ou est dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire, nous communiquerons avec ses conseillers m\u00e9dicaux afin de quantifier ses restrictions et d\u2019obtenir un pronostic plus complet. Veuillez nous informer de votre d\u00e9cision.\n(C\u2019est moi qui souligne)\n[30] Le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1996, soit \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s une semaine plus tard, M. Mooney a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant pour l\u2019informer qu\u2019on mettait fin \u00e0 son emploi. Dans une lettre de suivi adress\u00e9e au plaignant le 19 f\u00e9vrier 1996, M. Mooney a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa pr\u00e9sente fait suite \u00e0 notre rencontre du 15 f\u00e9vrier 1996 visant \u00e0 clarifier votre situation d\u2019emploi au sein de la Commission.\nCompte tenu de l\u2019information pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 cette occasion, nous estimons n\u00e9cessaire de mettre fin \u00e0 votre emploi aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, pour cause d\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire chronique, \u00e0 compter du 15 f\u00e9vrier 1996.\n[31] Le plaignant a dit avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mooney de lui permettre de revenir au travail chez OC Transpo, mais que celui\u2011ci lui a affirm\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi serait maintenue. Selon ses dires, il se sentait [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s bien au moment de la cessation d\u2019emploi et d\u00e9sirait r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions habituelles de chauffeur d\u2019autobus. Il a admis qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore [TRADUCTION] totalement r\u00e9tabli et qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de remplir sur\u2011le-champ ses fonctions habituelles de chauffeur d\u2019autobus. Toutefois, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 capable d\u2019exercer des fonctions modifi\u00e9es pendant une p\u00e9riode de transition, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la recommandation des Drs Sequiera et Erickson.\nC. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la cessation d\u2019emploi du plaignant [32] Quelques jours plus tard, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief afin de contester son cong\u00e9diement. Une fois franchies les diverses \u00e9tapes du processus de r\u00e8glement des griefs, l\u2019affaire a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e d\u2019arbitrage le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1998. L\u2019arbitre du travail a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre et a rejet\u00e9 le grief. Il a conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] avait raisonnablement conclu au regard de la preuve devant elle que le plaignant [TRADUCTION] ne serait pas en mesure de remplir ses fonctions de chauffeur d\u2019autobus de fa\u00e7on assidue .\n[33] Dans une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal avant l\u2019audience sur le fond de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soutenu que l\u2019objet de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant devant la Commission relevait de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive de l\u2019arbitre du travail et que les principes de lachose jug\u00e9e et de l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la cause d\u2019action emp\u00eachaient le Tribunal de pouvoir instruire la plainte. La pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, Anne L. Mactavish, a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate le 15 juillet 2002[2]. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, elle a conclu que l\u2019arbitre devait d\u00e9terminer si la cessation d\u2019emploi \u00e9tait injustifi\u00e9e, et non pas si le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi.\nD. Les t\u00e9moignages des experts [34] La Commission a fait compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019audience, \u00e0 titre d\u2019experts les Drs Erickson et Sequeira. L\u2019un et l\u2019autre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus comme des personnes ayant acquis, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des \u00e9tudes ou par suite de leurs contacts avec le plaignant, des connaissances sp\u00e9ciales ou particuli\u00e8res qui pourraient \u00e9clairer le Tribunal au sujet de leurs rapports avec lui et de leur domaine respectif de sp\u00e9cialisation (la psychologie dans le cas du Dr Erickson et la psychiatrie dans celui du Dr Sequeira).\n[35] De l\u2019avis du Dr Erickson, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 afflig\u00e9 du syndrome de stress post-traumatique deux fois entre 1989 et 1996, inclusivement : la premi\u00e8re fois, au d\u00e9but de cette p\u00e9riode (entre le moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de menaces de mort en 1989 et son retour au travail en septembre 1992) et la deuxi\u00e8me fois, vers la fin de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., entre juin 1994 et f\u00e9vrier 1996). Entre ces intervalles , le plaignant a \u00e9galement travers\u00e9 une p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 il a souffert de [TRADUCTION] troubles profonds du sommeil et de l\u2019humeur et d\u2019angoisse g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e (entre octobre 1993 et juin 1995), laquelle a chevauch\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9pisode finale du SSPT. Selon le Dr Erickson, les troubles dont le plaignant a souffert dans ce laps de temps \u00e9taient [TRADUCTION] vraisemblablement li\u00e9s \u2013 de mani\u00e8re indirecte au premier \u00e9pisode du SSPT.\n[36] Selon le Dr Erickson, le plaignant pr\u00e9sentait tous les sympt\u00f4mes classiques du syndrome de stress post-traumatique, notamment :\n\u00b7 \u00e9v\u00e9nement traumatique;\n\u00b7 reviviscence de l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement (souvenirs envahissants le jour), cauchemars \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition;\n\u00b7 conduite d\u2019\u00e9vitement vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis de choses qui lui plaisaient dans le pass\u00e9;\n\u00b7 \u00e9tat persistant d\u2019hypervigilance.\n[37] Pour sa part, le Dr Sequeira a reconnu que le diagnostic initial de SSPT \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] bien \u00e9tay\u00e9 et que le plaignant \u00e9tait pleinement afflig\u00e9 de cette maladie en 1989. \u00c0 son avis, le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9pisode (1994\u20111995) n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas un \u00e0 proprement parler; il s\u2019agissait plut\u00f4t d\u2019une rechute. En ce qui concerne certaines des autres maladies ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 des absences, le Dr Sequeira a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas rare que des personnes atteintes du SSPT souffrent \u00e9galement d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, de phobie, de d\u00e9pression profonde et de troubles du sommeil. Selon le Dr Sequeira, il se peut m\u00eame qu\u2019il existe un lien entre le SSPT et certains autres malaises dont le plaignant a souffert, notamment la diarrh\u00e9e et les spasmes musculaires. Il se peut \u00e9galement que ces sympt\u00f4mes n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9s au SSPT.\nII. LE CADRE JURIDIQUE ET L\u2019ANALYSE A. Le droit [38] Aux termes de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, le fait de refuser de continuer d\u2019employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. La d\u00e9ficience figure parmi les motifs de distinction illicites \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi. Selon l\u2019article 25, d\u00e9ficience , au sens de la Loi, d\u00e9signe la d\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu\u2019elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, y compris le d\u00e9figurement ainsi que la d\u00e9pendance, pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, envers l\u2019alcool ou la drogue .\n[39] Selon le paragraphe 15a) de la version ant\u00e9rieure de la Loi, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire celle qui existait avant les modifications de 1998[3], le fait pour un employeur de traiter diff\u00e9remment un employ\u00e9 ne constituait pas un acte discriminatoire s\u2019il d\u00e9coulait d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ( EPJ ). En 1999, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans des affaires qu\u2019on appelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement Meiorin[4] et Grismer[5], a eu l\u2019occasion de red\u00e9finir la m\u00e9thode \u00e0 suivre lorsqu\u2019un tel moyen de d\u00e9fense est invoqu\u00e9. La Cour a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il incombe d\u2019abord \u00e0 la partie plaignante de prouver que la norme ou la politique adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019employeur-intim\u00e9 est \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue discriminatoire.\n[40] Une fois que l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, l\u2019employeur-intim\u00e9 peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e en d\u00e9montrant, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s,\nqu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e; qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme en question en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, l\u2019employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il ne pouvait composer avec les employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9sentant les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans subir une contrainte excessive[6].\nB. La preuve prima facie [41] Selon la Commission, il suffit de se reporter \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli avant l\u2019audience conform\u00e9ment aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal, pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie. Le document pr\u00e9cise, entre autres, les faits mat\u00e9riels que l\u2019intim\u00e9e cherche \u00e0 prouver \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions (alin\u00e9a 6(1)a) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires). L\u2019un des faits mat\u00e9riels mentionn\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e est que les absences du plaignant \u00e9taient le r\u00e9sultat de maladies, notamment du SSPT et de troubles chroniques du sommeil. Apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le nombre de jours d\u2019absence du plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1996 pour absent\u00e9isme chronique, [TRADUCTION] car on n\u2019avait pas espoir qu\u2019il puisse faire montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail .\n[42] Dans une lettre que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a adress\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la Commission, il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment du cong\u00e9diement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e estimait que le plaignant \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 exercer pleinement et assid\u00fbment ses fonctions de chauffeur d\u2019autobus. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 la th\u00e8se voulant que le rapport m\u00e9dical du 31 janvier 1996 des Drs Sequeira et Erickson fournissait un pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 dans l\u2019exercice de ces fonctions et a, par cons\u00e9quent, cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le plaignant.\n[43] Deux anciens gestionnaires d\u2019OC Transpo, MM. Ron Marcotte et Gerald Timlin, ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments examin\u00e9s par le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existait un pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 \u00e9tait le dossier de pr\u00e9sence. Il ne fait aucun doute que le dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e9tait pi\u00e8tre; toutefois, la Commission a fait remarquer que cette situation \u00e9tait attribuable aux maladies du plaignant, principalement le SSPT, une d\u00e9ficience mentale qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de d\u00e9ficience \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 de la Loi.\n[44] Par cons\u00e9quent, toutes les conditions \u00e0 remplir pour prouver l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie sont r\u00e9unies, a\u2011t\u2011on soutenu. Le plaignant, qui \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, en raison notamment de son dossier d\u2019absent\u00e9isme. La principale cause de son absent\u00e9isme \u00e9tait sa d\u00e9ficience. Par cons\u00e9quent, un des facteurs qui ont jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant \u00e9tait la d\u00e9ficience, qui constitue un des motifs de discrimination illicites aux termes de la Loi. Pour qu\u2019une plainte soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, il suffit que la discrimination soit l\u2019un des facteurs expliquant la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e[7]. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a contrevenu \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e0 la Loi, au dire de la Commission.\n[45] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord, soutenant que le plaignant, pour prouver l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie, doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il a vraiment fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une discrimination. Il ne suffit pas de pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination du seul fait qu\u2019une personne handicap\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Il faut prouver que cette personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en raison de la d\u00e9ficience. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir qu\u2019elle ne contestait pas l\u2019avis des experts m\u00e9dicaux selon lequel le plaignant \u00e9tait en mesure de retourner au travail comme chauffeur d\u2019autobus. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9, dans sa plaidoirie, la position qu\u2019il avait adopt\u00e9e dans la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e avec la Commission avant l\u2019audience, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 1996, l\u2019intim\u00e9e le jugeait apte \u00e0 exercer int\u00e9gralement et assid\u00fbment ses fonctions de chauffeur d\u2019autobus. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que, par cons\u00e9quent, la d\u00e9cision de renvoyer le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. En l\u2019absence de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment, la Commission ne peut pr\u00e9tendre que le plaignant a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un traitement discriminatoire en raison d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 uniquement en raison du mauvais pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9, et non \u00e0 cause de sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer ses fonctions lorsqu\u2019il se pr\u00e9senterait au travail. La fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e a trait\u00e9 le plaignant, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 sa politique sur l\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas diff\u00e9rente de sa fa\u00e7on de traiter n\u2019importe quel travailleur, atteint ou non d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, qui n\u2019avait pas un bon dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 et dont le pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 \u00e9tait lui aussi insatisfaisant.\n[46] \u00c0 mon avis, cet argument n\u2019est pas corrobor\u00e9 par les faits. De toute \u00e9vidence, la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant, comme semble l\u2019indiquer le t\u00e9moignage de M. Timlin, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque directeur de l\u2019Hygi\u00e8ne au travail, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des avantages \u00e0 OC Transpo. M. Timlin a particip\u00e9 au processus de gestion qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a indiqu\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019OC Transpo de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e dans une large mesure sur l\u2019opinion du Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne. Dans la note qu\u2019il a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la direction au sujet du pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 concernant le plaignant, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne n\u2019aurait pu \u00eatre plus clair, pr\u00e9cisant que sa conclusion \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur les [TRADUCTION] renseignements m\u00e9dicaux figurant au dossier et le [TRADUCTION] dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 du plaignant. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut maintenant pr\u00e9tendre que l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un des facteurs qui l\u2019ont amen\u00e9e \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il devait \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, pour conclure \u00e0 la discrimination, que la seule explication de la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9side dans un motif de distinction illicite. J\u2019ajouterai que M. Timlin a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019OC Transpo de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant n\u2019a pas du tout \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par l\u2019autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9 dans la note du Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il ne d\u00e9tenait pas de permis de classe C. M. Timlin a expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aide r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement les employ\u00e9s dont le permis a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9class\u00e9 en leur absence \u00e0 recouvrer le type de permis qu\u2019ils d\u00e9tenaient auparavant.\n[47] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de son all\u00e9gation voulant que sa d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9voque le mauvais dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 du plaignant, qui remonte aux ann\u00e9es 1970 et bien avant qu\u2019il soit afflig\u00e9 du SSPT. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend donc que le plaignant \u00e9tait simplement quelqu\u2019un qui ne pouvait se pr\u00e9senter assid\u00fbment au travail. L\u2019employeur qui subit les cons\u00e9quences du manquement de l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations professionnelles devrait \u00eatre fond\u00e9 \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que le contrat d\u2019emploi a pris fin. Toutefois, cet argument ne tient pas vraiment compte des faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne, dans sa note \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant, exprime indubitablement des inqui\u00e9tudes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de ce dernier. En outre, m\u00eame si certaines absences du plaignant n\u2019\u00e9taient pas attribuables au SSPT, la majeure partie d\u2019entre elles l\u2019\u00e9taient; de surcro\u00eet, j\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage des experts de la Commission selon lequel certaines de ses autres maladies \u00e9taient peut-\u00eatre li\u00e9es au SSPT. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, en supposant que l\u2019absent\u00e9isme ant\u00e9rieur au SSPT ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui a jou\u00e9 dans son cong\u00e9diement, pourquoi alors le plaignant n\u2019a\u2011t\u2011il pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 avant le d\u00e9but de la d\u00e9ficience? Il convient de mentionner qu\u2019au cours de la p\u00e9riode qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 son cong\u00e9diement, la plus longue absence ininterrompue du plaignant est survenue alors qu\u2019il se remettait du SSPT et d\u2019autres maladies qui \u00e9taient peut-\u00eatre reli\u00e9es \u00e0 cette affection.\n[48] Je n\u2019accepte pas l\u2019autre pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle on ne devrait pas comparer la fa\u00e7on dont le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 avec la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s d\u2019OC Transpo pr\u00e9sentant un mauvais dossier d\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire. Le dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e9tait inextricablement li\u00e9 \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience. L\u2019intim\u00e9e admet qu\u2019\u00e0 la date de son cong\u00e9diement, le plaignant \u00e9tait jug\u00e9 apte \u00e0 retourner au travail. Cependant, l\u2019employeur s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il produise une preuve, m\u00e9dicale ou autre, d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il serait en mesure de se pr\u00e9senter r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement au travail et de faire preuve de fiabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme, sur une p\u00e9riode pouvant atteindre une vingtaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es, selon M. Timlin. D\u2019autres employ\u00e9s d\u2019OC Transpo qui \u00e9taient en meilleure sant\u00e9 que le plaignant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de conserver un bon dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019ils ne pr\u00e9sentaient pas la caract\u00e9ristique qui le distinguait, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire une d\u00e9ficience. On n\u2019a pas laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019on s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que ces employ\u00e9s fournissent des preuves d\u00e9montrant une probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 sur une vingtaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es. Dans ce sens\u2011l\u00e0, le plaignant, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des employ\u00e9s qui ne pr\u00e9sentaient pas cette caract\u00e9ristique.\n[49] \u00c0 mon avis, la pr\u00e9diction de l\u2019intim\u00e9e voulant que la probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 du plaignant soit mauvaise \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le risque qu\u2019il fasse une rechute. Lorsque M. Mooney, le surintendant du personnel op\u00e9rationnel, a demand\u00e9 l\u2019opinion du Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne avant de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant, il \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent de ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au moment o\u00f9 on avait \u00e9mis un pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9, en 1994, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut surmont\u00e9 ses troubles du sommeil. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Timlin, l\u2019employeur cherchait en fait \u00e0 obtenir une garantie suppl\u00e9mentaire que le dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 du plaignant s\u2019am\u00e9liorerait.\n[50] Je suis persuad\u00e9 que l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que le plaignant ferait vraisemblablement une rechute, qui entra\u00eenerait d\u2019autres absences, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la base de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant. Une conduite motiv\u00e9e par la possibilit\u00e9, r\u00e9elle ou per\u00e7ue, qu\u2019un individu puisse \u00eatre atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience dans l\u2019avenir constitue une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, selon la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada \u2013 Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J.) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville) ( Montr\u00e9al )[8]. M\u00eame si cette affaire relevait de la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne[9], qui interdit la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le handicap d\u2019une personne, par opposition \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience , la Cour a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne faut pas se r\u00e9fugier derri\u00e8re des diff\u00e9rences de terminologie pour conclure \u00e0 des divergences entre les objectifs poursuivis par les lois sur les droits de la personne au Canada[10].\n[51] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que son intention a en tout temps \u00e9t\u00e9 de g\u00e9rer les pr\u00e9sences au sein de son effectif. Le droit du travail reconna\u00eet \u00e0 l\u2019employeur le droit de cong\u00e9dier un employ\u00e9 pour absent\u00e9isme involontaire marqu\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019employeur r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019employ\u00e9 a affich\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9 un dossier d\u2019absent\u00e9isme chronique et sera incapable de se pr\u00e9senter assid\u00fbment au travail \u00e0 l\u2019avenir[11]. Toutefois, toute analyse des motifs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas pertinente en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il est bien \u00e9tabli en droit qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer une discrimination pour prouver qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation canadienne sur les droits de la personne[12]. Si l\u2019application d\u2019une politique en mati\u00e8re de relations du travail a un effet non intentionnel, qui consiste \u00e0 traiter de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et pr\u00e9judiciable une personne sur la base d\u2019un motif de distinction illicite, l\u2019employeur qui met en \u0153uvre la politique en question peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un verdict de discrimination.\n[52] L\u2019intim\u00e9e craint que si l\u2019on se fonde sur cette approche, le r\u00e9sultat logique sera que l\u2019employeur ne pourra jamais cong\u00e9dier un employ\u00e9 dont le degr\u00e9 d\u2019absent\u00e9isme li\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience est beaucoup trop \u00e9lev\u00e9. En effet, l\u2019employeur sera contraint de garder \u00e0 son service un employ\u00e9 qui n\u2019est pas en mesure de remplir l\u2019obligation qui lui incombe en vertu du contrat de travail, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire accomplir ses t\u00e2ches. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du travail dans Re: Air B.C. Ltd. and Canadian Airline Dispatchers Assn.[13], o\u00f9 l\u2019arbitre rejette pareille pr\u00e9tention en faisant remarquer que le fait qu\u2019il existe une l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne n\u2019\u00e9limine pas pour autant le principe de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire en relations du travail.\n[53] Les conclusions de l\u2019arbitre du travail dans cette affaire servent cependant \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que les pr\u00e9occupations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont en fait injustifi\u00e9es. Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 l\u2019arbitre dans sa d\u00e9cision, il y a deux choses \u00e0 examiner en pareil cas : premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019employeur a\u2011t\u2011il r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer, comme le veut la jurisprudence en droit du travail, qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un cas d\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire? Deuxi\u00e8mement, la conduite de l\u2019employeur contrevient\u2011elle \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation applicable en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re question, il faut se livrer \u00e0 une analyse portant sur les EPJ en suivant la m\u00e9thode d\u00e9crite tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin. C\u2019est le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re Meiorin qui pr\u00e9serve le droit de l\u2019employeur de cong\u00e9dier un employ\u00e9 dans un cas semblable, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il ne peut composer avec l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 sans s\u2019imposer une contrainte excessive. Si l\u2019employeur est en mesure de d\u00e9montrer ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, sa d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier l\u2019employ\u00e9 pour son absent\u00e9isme involontaire sera justifi\u00e9e.\n[54] \u00c9valu\u00e9 au regard du crit\u00e8re des relations du travail, le dossier d\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire du plaignant est certes tr\u00e8s mauvais. Le pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas clair. Dans leur lettre du 31 janvier 1996, les experts m\u00e9dicaux ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le pronostic \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s bon ; toutefois, dans leur t\u00e9moignage respectif, ils ont tous deux expliqu\u00e9 que cette pr\u00e9diction se limitait au court terme. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 irresponsable de leur part de tenter de pr\u00e9dire, sur un horizon plus lointain, l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant. Selon l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je suis li\u00e9 d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on par les conclusions de fait de l\u2019arbitre du travail qui, dans sa d\u00e9cision concernant le grief du plaignant, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e0 vrai dire mauvais. Cependant, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 mon avis de suivre cette approche, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la preuve m\u00e9dicale pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les experts de la Commission ne contredit pas la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e voulant qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque du cong\u00e9diement, le pronostic au\u2011del\u00e0 du court terme \u00e9tait \u00e0 tout le moins incertain.\n[55] Il convient de souligner ici que m\u00eame si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a bien \u00e9valu\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant et si sa d\u00e9cision satisfait au crit\u00e8re de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence relevant du droit du travail, la question dont ce tribunal des droits de la personne est saisi demeure enti\u00e8re. Il faut quand m\u00eame se livrer \u00e0 l\u2019analyse concernant les EPJ d\u00e9crite par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Meiorin.\n[56] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, j\u2019estime que l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. La d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant, dans le cadre de son programme visant \u00e0 g\u00e9rer et favoriser l\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au sein de son effectif, \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, du moins en partie, sur la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, il incombe maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de d\u00e9montrer que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\nC. Le crit\u00e8re Meiorin i) Les premier et deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ments [57] Le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re Meiorin exige que l\u2019employeur d\u00e9montre que la norme en cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions. Un document d\u00e9crivant le Programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences d\u2019OC Transpo a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve. M. Marcotte a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les principes qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s sont le reflet de la politique qui existait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en 1996, bien que le document proprement dit ait sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 quelques mois plus tard. Selon ce document, l\u2019objectif d\u00e9clar\u00e9 du Programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences \u00e9tait le suivant :\n[TRADUCTION]\n[...] r\u00e9duire le co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme de fa\u00e7on coh\u00e9rente et \u00e9quitable pour tous les employ\u00e9s. Les employ\u00e9s ont l\u2019obligation de se pr\u00e9senter assid\u00fbment au travail; OC Transpo a l\u2019obligation de; [sic] cr\u00e9er des conditions de travail qui favorisent l\u2019assiduit\u00e9, de surveiller les pr\u00e9sences et de se concerter avec les employ\u00e9s qui affichent un taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme hors de l\u2019ordinaire.\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la conclusion que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans Eyerley c. Seaspan International Ltd.[14], il y a un lien rationnel \u00e9vident entre une r\u00e8gle visant \u00e0 assurer un niveau d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 raisonnable au travail et les exigences propres au travail. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, la Commission n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9tendu que le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[58] De m\u00eame, on n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a adopt\u00e9 le Programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences en toute bonne foi, en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but vis\u00e9.\nii) Le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment [59] Pour d\u00e9montrer que son programme visant \u00e0 pallier l\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre son but vis\u00e9, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire assurer un niveau d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 raisonnable, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit prouver qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait impossible de composer avec le plaignant ou d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9sentant les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques, sans qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte pour elle une contrainte excessive.\n[60] Lorsque la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en 1998, le paragraphe 15(2) a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9. Selon ce paragraphe, les co\u00fbts, la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont des facteurs dont l\u2019employeur peut tenir compte pour d\u00e9terminer si composer avec une personne lui imposerait une contrainte excessive. Cependant, les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte sont survenus avant l\u2019adoption de cette modification; comme on l\u2019a fait remarquer dans Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d\u2019Ottawa-Carleton[15], je dois examiner la question de l\u2019accommodement au regard des principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Central Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Human Rights Commission)[16] et plusieurs d\u00e9cisions subs\u00e9quentes. Certains de ces principes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s dans Eyerley[17] :\nDans Central Okanagan School District no 23 c. Renaud[18], le juge Sopinka a fait observer que l\u2019utilisation du mot excessive laisse supposer qu\u2019une certaine contrainte est acceptable, mais qu\u2019il faut absolument, pour satisfaire \u00e0 la norme, que la contrainte impos\u00e9e soit excessive . Dans Central Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Human Rights Commission)[19], la Cour supr\u00eame s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur d\u2019autres facteurs pertinents, notamment le co\u00fbt financier, l\u2019interchangeabilit\u00e9 des effectifs et des installations, les dispositions de la convention collective, l\u2019atteinte r\u00e9elle aux droits et au moral des coll\u00e8gues de travail et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s. Le co\u00fbt excessif peut justifier le refus de composer avec les personnes atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience; toutefois, il faut se garder de ne pas accorder suffisamment d\u2019importance \u00e0 l\u2019accommodement de la personne handicap\u00e9e. Il est beaucoup trop facile d\u2019invoquer l\u2019augmentation des co\u00fbts pour justifier le refus d\u2019accorder un traitement \u00e9gal aux personnes handicap\u00e9es[20]. Bien que les dispositions d\u2019une convention collective ne puissent d\u00e9gager l\u2019employeur de son obligation d\u2019accommodement, une d\u00e9rogation importante aux conditions d\u2019emploi qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 examiner pour d\u00e9terminer si la contrainte impos\u00e9e est excessive[21].\n[61] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019aspect accommodement de l\u2019analyse n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas n\u00e9cessaire dans les cas de cong\u00e9diement pour absent\u00e9isme involontaire. Lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9value le pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9, l\u2019employeur tient compte implicitement de la possibilit\u00e9 de tenir compte de ses besoins sans subir une contrainte excessive. Comme l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a fait remarquer, il n\u2019y a [TRADUCTION] rien d\u2019incompatible \u00e0 ce que les consid\u00e9rations relatives aux cong\u00e9diements pour absent\u00e9isme involontaire et celles li\u00e9es aux droits de la personne soient interd\u00e9pendantes . Dans de tels cas, par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est plus n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re Meiorin.\n[62] Avec respect, je ne puis accepter cette conclusion. Comme l\u2019arbitre l\u2019indique dans la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Air B.C., l\u2019examen des cong\u00e9diements pour absent\u00e9isme involontaire comporte deux volets. Le premier est r\u00e9gi par le droit du travail et la deuxi\u00e8me, par la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne. Je ne vois pas comment on peut pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019une fois qu\u2019il a conclu \u00e0 juste titre que le pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 de l\u2019employ\u00e9 est mauvais, l\u2019employeur s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement que lui impose la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne. L\u2019examen de la d\u00e9cision arbitrale rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du grief du plaignant corrobore ce point. La d\u00e9cision d\u2019OC Transpo de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme justifi\u00e9e, m\u00eame si l\u2019arbitre n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 la question \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019employeur avait compos\u00e9 avec l\u2019employ\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la contrainte excessive, conform\u00e9ment aux principes relatifs aux droits de la personne mentionn\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus. Les observations de l\u2019arbitre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard se sont limit\u00e9es \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale voulant que le plaignant ait [TRADUCTION] amplement fait l\u2019objet de mesures d\u2019adaptation par le pass\u00e9 sans que cela ne donne de r\u00e9sultats et qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas, par cons\u00e9quent, [TRADUCTION] d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 l\u2019employeur n\u2019avait pas compos\u00e9 avec la d\u00e9ficience . La notion de contrainte excessive n\u2019a m\u00eame jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e.\n[63] Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a invoqu\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me motif \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de l\u2019aspect accommodement. Forte de l\u2019avis m\u00e9dical des Drs Sequeira et Erickson, OC Transpo a jug\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 travailler comme chauffeur d\u2019autobus au moment de son cong\u00e9diement. Par cons\u00e9quent, la question de l\u2019accommodement ne se posait pas aux yeux de l\u2019employeur. Comme il en \u00e9tait venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme du plaignant \u00e9tait mauvais, la seule forme d\u2019accommodement possible pour OC Transpo aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de tol\u00e9rer le niveau d\u2019absent\u00e9isme \u00e9lev\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu. Au dire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 une forme d\u2019accommodement acceptable.\n[64] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a attir\u00e9 mon attention sur une affaire instruite en 1992 par une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ontario, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019affaire Bonner v. Ontario (Minister of Health)[22]. Le plaignant \u00e9tait p\u00e9riodiquement en proie \u00e0 la d\u00e9pression. La commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate a mentionn\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision [TRADUCTION] qu\u2019une personne qui, en raison d\u2019un handicap, ne peut faire son travail de fa\u00e7on comp\u00e9tente et assidue est incapable de satisfaire aux exigences du poste, peu importe le rendement qu\u2019elle pourrait fournir en l\u2019absence de ce handicap [23]. La commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate a poursuivi son raisonnement en rejetant la pr\u00e9misse voulant qu\u2019une personne atteinte d\u2019une telle d\u00e9ficience doive faire l\u2019objet de mesures d\u2019adaptation, dans le sens o\u00f9 la situation doit \u00eatre tol\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[65] \u00c0 mon avis, cette d\u00e9cision n\u2019est gu\u00e8re pertinente en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. D\u2019abord, il s\u2019agit de remarques incidentes, la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate ayant principalement conclu que le plaignant n\u2019aurait pas fourni un rendement satisfaisant, handicap ou non. Par ailleurs, la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le fait de traiter de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente une personne susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience \u00e0 l\u2019avenir constituait une forme de discrimination. La conclusion de la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate est incompatible avec le jugement rendu subs\u00e9quemment par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019affaire Montr\u00e9al. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on restrictive les principes de l\u2019accommodement et de la contrainte excessive. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que le principe de la contrainte excessive n\u2019exige pas que l\u2019employeur embauche ou garde \u00e0 son service des employ\u00e9s qui, en raison d\u2019un handicap, sont en tout temps ou \u00e0 l\u2019occasion incapables de faire leur travail, simplement parce que les ressources dont il dispose lui permettent de tol\u00e9rer un [TRADUCTION] travail qui est, en fait, vraiment insatisfaisant [24]. Le droit est all\u00e9 bien au\u2011del\u00e0 de cette interpr\u00e9tation, comme en fait foi la d\u00e9claration de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Meiorin, \u00e0 savoir que l\u2019employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans qu\u2019il subisse une contrainte excessive[25].\n[66] Par ailleurs, je ne vois pas comment une attitude tol\u00e9rante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme ne peut constituer une forme d\u2019accommodement acceptable. Certes, tous les employeurs doivent \u00eatre pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter un certain degr\u00e9 d\u2019absent\u00e9isme au sein de leur personnel, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il est in\u00e9vitable que des employ\u00e9s ne soient pas en mesure de temps \u00e0 autre de se pr\u00e9senter au travail. La question \u00e0 trancher est la suivante : cette tol\u00e9rance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un certain degr\u00e9 d\u2019absent\u00e9isme imposerait-elle une contrainte excessive \u00e0 l\u2019employeur, compte tenu de tous les facteurs pertinents. Dans une affaire r\u00e9cente (UNA c. Calgary Health Authority[26]), la Cour du Banc de la Reine de l\u2019Alberta a eu \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer notamment si l\u2019employeur est tenu d\u2019embaucher \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e une femme qualifi\u00e9e qui est enceinte, sachant au d\u00e9part qu\u2019elle ne pourra, en raison de son accouchement imminent, travailler pendant toute la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e. La Cour a jug\u00e9 que ce serait une erreur de pr\u00e9sumer que ce genre de probl\u00e8me de disponibilit\u00e9 se traduirait in\u00e9vitablement par une contrainte excessive. La Cour n\u2019a pas fait de distinction entre l\u2019obligation de composer avec cette forme d\u2019absent\u00e9isme et celle d\u00e9crite dans des causes comme Central Alberta Dairy Pool et Simpsons-Sears[27], o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait pour l\u2019employeur de composer jusqu\u2019au point de la contrainte excessive avec des employ\u00e9s qui se seraient absent\u00e9s r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Je ne partage donc pas l\u2019opinion de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re Meiorin ne s\u2019applique pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[67] Si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a jug\u00e9 que la seule forme d\u2019accommodement possible serait de tol\u00e9rer l\u2019absent\u00e9isme, c\u2019est notamment parce qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que le plaignant pouvait travailler uniquement comme chauffeur d\u2019autobus. Cependant, la preuve indique qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait autrement. D\u2019abord, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne, dans la note (deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe) sur laquelle la direction d\u2019OC Transpo s\u2019est fond\u00e9e pour d\u00e9cider de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant, a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 communiquer avec les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux de celui\u2011ci pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il pourrait exercer un [TRADUCTION] autre emploi , dans la mesure o\u00f9 sa division employeuse \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] capable et d\u00e9sireuse de lui offrir une telle solution de rechange . Par cons\u00e9quent, le Service d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne n\u2019a pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que le plaignant puisse remplir de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante d\u2019autres fonctions.\n[68] En outre, le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsqu\u2019on lui a dit qu\u2019on ne lui permettrait pas de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions, il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mooney de lui confier d\u2019autrest\u00e2ches au sein d\u2019OC Transpo. M. Mooney lui a oppos\u00e9 une fin de non-recevoir, l\u2019informant qu\u2019aucune forme de [TRADUCTION] r\u00e9adaptation ne serait offerte. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019ensemble du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant est limpide et cr\u00e9dible et aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour contredire ce dont il se rappelait de cette conversation. M\u00eame si les gestionnaires d\u2019OC Transpo qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant (y compris MM. Mooney et Timlin) estimaient que le seul choix possible en l\u2019occurrence \u00e9tait de le garder comme chauffeur d\u2019autobus, il existait de toute \u00e9vidence, compte tenu de l\u2019information dont ils disposaient, des solutions de rechange qu\u2019ils auraient d\u00fb examiner.\n[69] Ce point nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 soulever une autre lacune importante dans le traitement du cas du plaignant. Dans Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a fait \u00e9tat de l\u2019opportunit\u00e9, aux fins de l\u2019analyse de l\u2019aspect accommodement, d\u2019examiner s\u00e9par\u00e9ment :\nle caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure que l\u2019employeur a adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9tudier la question de l\u2019accommodement; et la teneur r\u00e9elle d\u2019une norme plus conciliante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant[28].\nDe l\u2019avis de la Commission, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas, dans le cas de la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant, suivi les lignes de conduite d\u00e9crites dans son propre programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences et, par cons\u00e9quent, a omis de composer avec lui du point de vue de la proc\u00e9dure. Par exemple, le Programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences pr\u00e9voyait que tous les efforts raisonnables devaient \u00eatre d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour tenter de r\u00e9adapter l\u2019employ\u00e9 ou de composer avec lui dans un cas d\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela pouvait \u00eatre fait sans subir une contrainte excessive. Ces m\u00e9canismes d\u2019adaptation comprenaient les options offertes par le CESEH, telles que le bus-navette auquel le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 en 1992.\n[70] On pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement dans la description du Programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences qu\u2019on peut [TRADUCTION] cong\u00e9dier quelqu\u2019un pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales uniquement si l\u2019on a fait tous les efforts raisonnables pour composer avec l\u2019employ\u00e9 au sein du milieu de travail . Selon la Commission, on a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 l\u2019employ\u00e9 avant de d\u00e9ployer de tels efforts. En fait, j\u2019estime que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 qui incombe le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de composer avec l\u2019employ\u00e9, n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuves d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019elle avait fait de tels efforts. Au contraire, il semble que l\u2019inti\u00e9e, ayant conclu que le plaignant \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 exercer ses fonctions, a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement sans examiner d\u2019autres solutions. Cependant, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, la d\u00e9cision d\u2019OC Transpo a \u00e9t\u00e9 vici\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9somption que le plaignant ne serait pas en mesure de faire montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail parce qu\u2019on craignait qu\u2019il devienne malade \u00e0 l\u2019avenir.\n[71] Dans leur lettre, les experts m\u00e9dicaux font allusion au fait qu\u2019un processus de conditionnement au travail serait de nature \u00e0 aider \u00e0 la r\u00e9adaptation du plaignant. En outre, les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents du plaignant d\u00e9montraient que les situations stressantes (p. ex., refaire le trajet o\u00f9 il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 agress\u00e9 auparavant) nuisaient \u00e0 sa gu\u00e9rison. En veillant \u00e0 ce que le plaignant ne soit pas confront\u00e9 \u00e0 de telles situations, on aurait pu aider \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir une rechute. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant n\u2019ont jamais indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait confier \u00e0 celui\u2011ci un autre travail; ils ont plut\u00f4t dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions de chauffeur d\u2019autobus. Je ne trouve pas cet argument convaincant. Rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019on se soit enquis aupr\u00e8s des experts de la possibilit\u00e9 que le plaignant fasse un autre travail. Les Drs Sequeira et Erickson \u00e9taient certes dispos\u00e9s, ainsi qu\u2019ils l\u2019ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans leur lettre du 31 janvier 1996, \u00e0 prodiguer des conseils \u00e0 l\u2019employeur au sujet des t\u00e2ches qui pourraient lui \u00eatre confi\u00e9es, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment \u00e0 titre de chauffeur d\u2019autobus. Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la crainte que le plaignant ne soit pas en mesure de se pr\u00e9senter assid\u00fbment au travail en tant que chauffeur d\u2019autobus, rien n\u2019emp\u00eachait l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, de demander aux experts leur opinion au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 que leur patient ex\u00e9cute un autre travail. Rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019une telle d\u00e9marche ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\n[72] Les employeurs ont\u2011ils l\u2019obligation de faire une telle d\u00e9marche? L\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette question par la n\u00e9gative, citant le jugement r\u00e9cent de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans l\u2019affaire Oak Bay Marina Ltd. (c.o.b. Painter\u2019s Lodge) v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission) ( Oak Bay )[29]. Dans cette cause, la Cour a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019en remettre \u00e0 sa propre connaissance du plaignant pour \u00e9valuer sa capacit\u00e9 de faire le travail et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de faire des d\u00e9marches pour v\u00e9rifier ce qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait de sa d\u00e9ficience mentale, par exemple, en demandant d\u2019autres avis d\u2019expert. Toutefois, les conclusions dans cette affaire sont de toute \u00e9vidence fond\u00e9es sur des faits particuliers. L\u2019employ\u00e9 en question travaillait comme guide \u00e0 bord de petits bateaux de p\u00eache qui naviguaient dans des eaux reconnues comme \u00e9tant les plus dangereuses en Colombie-Britannique. La vie des clients de l\u2019employeur \u00e9tait entre les mains du guide; il est \u00e9vident que la Cour a jug\u00e9 que, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des clients, l\u2019employeur \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 se fier \u00e0 sa connaissance empirique de la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant de fonctionner dans de telles circonstances. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant de bien ex\u00e9cuter ses fonctions lorsqu\u2019il travaille. Le probl\u00e8me aux yeux de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est le niveau d\u2019absent\u00e9isme du plaignant.\n[73] La Cour a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019obligation de faire la d\u00e9marche pouvait varier en fonction de la nature et de la taille de l\u2019employeur. Elle a \u00e9tabli une distinction entre la petite entreprise de l\u2019employeur et, par exemple, les activit\u00e9s d\u2019un gouvernement qui a \u00e0 sa disposition [TRADUCTION] des minist\u00e8res entiers et de grandes quantit\u00e9s d\u2019information [30]. OC Transpo rel\u00e8ve certes davantage de cette derni\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie. Enfin, en ce qui touche cette question de l\u2019obligation de faire une d\u00e9marche, je suis \u00e0 nouveau guid\u00e9 par les conclusions formul\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin. La Cour \u00e9nonce certaines questions importantes qu\u2019il faut se poser dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse du troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment. Il faut notamment se demander si l\u2019employeur a examin\u00e9 d\u2019autres options qui n\u2019avaient pas un effet discriminatoire. Cette conclusion implique l\u2019obligation pour l\u2019employeur de se livrer \u00e0 un tel examen. Il ne fait aucun doute que l\u2019employ\u00e9 doit collaborer avec l\u2019employeur dans le cadre d\u2019un tel processus; cependant, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, je suis persuad\u00e9 que le plaignant et ses conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9taient dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 aider \u00e0 trouver une fa\u00e7on d\u2019assurer sa r\u00e9adaptation et sa pleine r\u00e9int\u00e9gration au sein du personnel d\u2019OC Transpo.\n[74] En supposant que, comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la seule forme d\u2019accommodement possible ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de tol\u00e9rer l\u2019absent\u00e9isme du plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, quels \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il en aurait r\u00e9sult\u00e9 pour l\u2019employeur une contrainte excessive?\n[75] Le calendrier de travail des chauffeurs d\u2019autobus \u00e9tait de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tabli en fonction de quatre ou cinq p\u00e9riodes d\u2019affectation par ann\u00e9e. Avant chaque p\u00e9riode, les chauffeurs \u00e9taient autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 choisir leurs trajets et les dates o\u00f9 ils travailleraient, selon leur anciennet\u00e9. Une des options qui s\u2019offraient \u00e0 eux \u00e9tait de faire inscrire leur nom sur la liste des suppl\u00e9ants . Cette liste comprenait un certain nombre de chauffeurs (entre 30 et 50 selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e) qui \u00e9taient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 remplacer des coll\u00e8gues absents. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019absences impr\u00e9vues (r\u00e9veil \u00e0 une heure tardive, temp\u00eate de neige, maladie, etc.). Les chauffeurs dont les noms figuraient sur la liste des suppl\u00e9ants recevaient leur plein salaire, que l\u2019on fasse appel ou non \u00e0 eux pour remplacer des chauffeurs absents.\n[76] Lorsque le nombre d\u2019absents d\u00e9passait le nombre de chauffeurs sur la liste des suppl\u00e9ants, OC Transpo \u00e9tait contrainte de demander \u00e0 d\u2019autres chauffeurs de suppl\u00e9er aux absences et de r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer leurs heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. \u00c0 l\u2019occasion, OC Transpo n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 trouver suffisamment de chauffeurs d\u00e9sireux d\u2019effectuer des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires; dans ces cas\u2011l\u00e0, les autobus ne quittaient pas le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, ce qui occasionnait des inconv\u00e9nients pour le public. Les usagers m\u00e9contents du service de transport en commun avaient l\u2019habitude de se plaindre des interruptions de service aux \u00e9lus locaux qui, \u00e0 leur tour, saisissaient la direction d\u2019OC Transpo de leurs pr\u00e9occupations.\n[77] M. Marcotte a occup\u00e9 le poste de gestionnaire des relations avec les employ\u00e9s chez OC Transpo. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, il a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la difficult\u00e9 de tenter de pr\u00e9dire combien de personnes s\u2019absenteraient un jour donn\u00e9 et, partant, d\u2019estimer le nombre de chauffeurs que devait compter la liste des suppl\u00e9ants.\n[78] Dans le cas d\u2019une absence de longue dur\u00e9e, o\u00f9 on savait avant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019affectation que l\u2019employ\u00e9 ne serait pas disponible pendant toute la p\u00e9riode, le chauffeur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9server des postes de travail. Je crois comprendre, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve plut\u00f4t sommaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ces absents n\u2019avaient pas de postes de travail normalement pr\u00e9vus, ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas remplac\u00e9s par des chauffeurs inscrits sur la liste des suppl\u00e9ants. En revanche, s\u2019il \u00e9tait incertain que l\u2019absence durerait toute la p\u00e9riode d\u2019affectation, l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9server des dates de travail. Lorsqu\u2019il ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas finalement au travail ces jours\u2011l\u00e0, il fallait faire appel \u00e0 un chauffeur dont le nom figurait sur la liste des suppl\u00e9ants.\n[79] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l\u2019absent\u00e9isme \u00e9ventuel du plaignant aurait pu causer les difficult\u00e9s d\u00e9crites ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\n\u00b7 Il aurait fallu faire appel, pour le remplacer, \u00e0 un chauffeur suppl\u00e9ant qui, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9, qu\u2019il travaille ou non.\n\u00b7 La liste des suppl\u00e9ants comptait un jour donn\u00e9 entre 30 et 50 noms de chauffeurs. Dans les cas o\u00f9 le nombre de chauffeurs suppl\u00e9ants disponibles n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant, il aurait fallu payer des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires pour le remplacer.\n\u00b7 Dans les cas o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de trouver un chauffeur d\u00e9sireux d\u2019effectuer du temps suppl\u00e9mentaire, le service d\u2019autobus aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompu sur un trajet donn\u00e9.\n\u00b7 Des usagers l\u00e9s\u00e9s du service de transport en commun auraient pu se plaindre \u00e0 leurs \u00e9lus locaux qui auraient \u00e0 leur tour port\u00e9 plainte \u00e0 la direction d\u2019OC Transpo.\n[80] \u00c0 mon avis, cette preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait subi une contrainte excessive si elle avait eu \u00e0 composer avec l\u2019absent\u00e9isme \u00e9ventuel du plaignant.\n[81] D\u2019abord, cette preuve, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le cadre des t\u00e9moignages de MM. Timlin et Marcotte, \u00e9tait essentiellement anecdotique. Avant de formuler ses commentaires, M. Timlin a pris soin de pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un sp\u00e9cialiste de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et des avantages des employ\u00e9s et non de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des calendriers de travail. Ni lui ni M. Marcotte n\u2019a fourni de d\u00e9tails quant \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il en co\u00fbtait pour tenir la liste des suppl\u00e9ants ou r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer le temps suppl\u00e9mentaire lorsque la liste des suppl\u00e9ants \u00e9tait \u00e9puis\u00e9e, particuli\u00e8rement par rapport aux d\u00e9penses totales d\u2019OC Transpo. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au sujet de la fr\u00e9quence \u00e0 laquelle on constatait que la liste des suppl\u00e9ants \u00e9tait \u00e9puis\u00e9e ou de la fr\u00e9quence \u00e0 laquelle le service au public devait \u00eatre interrompu en raison de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme des employ\u00e9s.\n[82] Le plaignant a re\u00e7u des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 durant un grand nombre de ses absences. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 propos des co\u00fbts que cela pouvait occasionner ou des difficult\u00e9s que cette situation lui causait.\n[83] M. Marcotte a confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019absence d\u2019un chauffeur d\u2019autobus ne mettait pas en danger la sant\u00e9 de qui que ce soit. Il a \u00e9galement admis qu\u2019il serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 de pr\u00e9tendre que le fait de faire trop d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires causerait tellement de stress aux employ\u00e9s suppl\u00e9ants qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulterait des pr\u00e9occupations au plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. En fait, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 les difficult\u00e9s qui en r\u00e9sulteraient pour le personnel en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La plupart des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es difficult\u00e9s avaient trait \u00e0 la tenue de la liste des suppl\u00e9ants. Cependant, la preuve concernant le plaignant a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que ce dernier \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e au cours d\u2019un bon nombre de ses absences, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu\u2019il se faisait soigner pour le SSPT. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9 de postes de travail durant son absence de neuf mois en 1992 et au cours des onze mois qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 son cong\u00e9diement. Il n\u2019avait donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de faire appel \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s dont les noms figuraient sur la liste des suppl\u00e9ants pour le remplacer durant ces p\u00e9riodes. Si, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019avait pr\u00e9vu, le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint de s\u2019absenter involontairement, ces absences auraient fort vraisemblablement ressembl\u00e9 aux incidents ant\u00e9rieurs et auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, elles n\u2019auraient pas eu d\u2019effets sur la liste des suppl\u00e9ants.\n[84] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 le r\u00e9cent jugement de la Cour divisionnaire de l\u2019Ontario dans Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Roosma[31]. Dans cette affaire, la Cour a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ontario. Deux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019usine d\u2019automobiles de Ford \u00e0 Oakville ne pouvaient, pour des motifs religieux, travailler entre le coucher du soleil le vendredi et le coucher du soleil le samedi. Ils ont demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre excus\u00e9s en permanence les vendredis soirs. La Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne a produit une preuve d\u00e9montrant que le co\u00fbt du remplacement par Ford des employ\u00e9s affect\u00e9s \u00e0 ces postes de travail \u00e9tait n\u00e9gligeable. La commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate a contest\u00e9 cette \u00e9valuation. Selon elle, il fallait inclure dans la notion de co\u00fbt le co\u00fbt r\u00e9el de la baisse de qualit\u00e9 et de production que cette situation entra\u00eenerait. Bien que difficile \u00e0 mesurer, ce co\u00fbt n\u2019en n\u2019\u00e9tait pas moins r\u00e9el \u00e0 son avis. La commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate a conclu qu\u2019en adoptant des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces employ\u00e9s, Ford subirait une contrainte excessive car il lui faudrait permuter des postes de travail ou embaucher des travailleurs \u00e0 temps partiel ou des \u00e9tudiants.\n[85] Les circonstances entourant l\u2019affaire Roosma diff\u00e8rent sensiblement de celles de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. D\u2019abord, la Cour n\u2019a pas n\u00e9cessairement fait siens les motifs de la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate; elle a simplement conclu que les conclusions de la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate r\u00e9pondaient \u00e0 la norme de contr\u00f4le judiciaire fond\u00e9e sur la raisonnabilit\u00e9 . La Cour a fait remarquer que Ford avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate une preuve vaste, d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et non contredite relativement aux cons\u00e9quences que comporterait l\u2019adoption de mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des plaignants. En outre, parmi les facteurs qui ont influenc\u00e9 les conclusions de la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate figuraient non seulement le co\u00fbt financier pour Ford, mais aussi l\u2019interchangeabilit\u00e9 de ses op\u00e9rations, l\u2019importance que chaque op\u00e9rateur soit \u00e0 son poste habituel, les cons\u00e9quences li\u00e9es \u00e0 la convention collective, les consid\u00e9rations en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l\u2019effet important de mesures d\u2019adaptation sur les autres travailleurs[32].\n[86] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, je n\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant au co\u00fbt financier r\u00e9el de mesures d\u2019adaptation pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou de la tol\u00e9rance de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme. La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui entre en ligne de compte, et on n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuves au sujet des cons\u00e9quences li\u00e9es \u00e0 la convention collective. Mis \u00e0 part le fait qu\u2019on ait fait \u00e9tat du stress suppl\u00e9mentaire qui pourrait en r\u00e9sulter pour les employ\u00e9s qui auraient \u00e0 faire du temps suppl\u00e9mentaire, cons\u00e9quence peu plausible, on ne m\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 comment des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme \u00e9ventuel du plaignant pourraient influer sur d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s. En outre, contrairement \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans Roosma relativement aux travailleurs affect\u00e9s \u00e0 la ligne de montage chez Ford, la preuve dont j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi indique que les t\u00e2ches des chauffeurs d\u2019autobus \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s interchangeables. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019affaire Roosma se distingue de celle qui nous occupe.\n[87] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019OC Transpo aurait subi une contrainte excessive si elle avait compos\u00e9 avec l\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire \u00e9ventuel du plaignant, apr\u00e8s son retour au travail en f\u00e9vrier 1996.\n[88] La plainte est donc fond\u00e9e.\nIII. LE REDRESSEMENT A. La r\u00e9int\u00e9gration dans les fonctions [89] Dans les cas o\u00f9 il juge qu\u2019une plainte de discrimination est fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal doit tenter de remettre la partie plaignante dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019acte discriminatoire[33]. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission soutient que le plaignant devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans le poste de chauffeur d\u2019autobus ou se voir confier un autre travail qui lui conviendrait selon le Tribunal.\n[90] Selon l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il ne conviendrait pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer l\u2019employ\u00e9. Au cours des sept ann\u00e9es qui se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis son cong\u00e9diement, le pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 du plaignant est demeur\u00e9 inchang\u00e9. Une fois qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9, les parties, si les pr\u00e9dictions de l\u2019employeur devaient se concr\u00e9tiser, se retrouverait \u00e0 nouveau dans la situation difficile d\u2019avoir \u00e0 composer avec le grand nombre d\u2019absences du plaignant. \u00c0 mon avis, cet argument repose sur une hypoth\u00e8se qui est elle-m\u00eame li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 soutenu qu\u2019une telle hypoth\u00e8se est discriminatoire et qu\u2019elle ne doit pas, par cons\u00e9quent, influencer l\u2019\u00e9laboration des mesures de redressement.\n[91] Je suis persuad\u00e9 que la mesure de redressement appropri\u00e9e consisterait \u00e0 reprendre le plaignant comme chauffeur d\u2019autobus. J\u2019ordonne donc que l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9int\u00e8gre le plaignant dans le poste de chauffeur d\u2019autobus tout en lui accordant les avantages d\u2019un employ\u00e9 permanent \u00e0 temps plein, notamment au chapitre de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9, le tout avec effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 la date de son cong\u00e9diement.\n[92] Selon la preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aide habituellement \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration au sein de l\u2019effectif des employ\u00e9s qui reviennent d\u2019un long cong\u00e9. Elle offre notamment \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 une formation et l\u2019aide dans ses d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s pour obtenir le renouvellement du permis de conduire requis. L\u2019intim\u00e9e doit fournir cette aide au plaignant.\nB. Les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour manque \u00e0 gagner [93] J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019indemniser le plaignant des pertes salariales qu\u2019il a subies entre le 2 f\u00e9vrier 1996 et la date de son retour au travail \u00e0 temps plein, en tenant compte de ses autres revenus et des retenues obligatoires et en majorant l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 aux fins de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. J\u2019ordonne \u00e9galement que soient faits les rajustements n\u00e9cessaires au titre des avantages.\n[94] Je ne partage pas l\u2019opinion de l\u2019intim\u00e9e voulant que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au titre des pertes salariales devrait \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e uniquement \u00e0 partir de la date de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du travail selon laquelle le cong\u00e9diement du plaignant \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9. La responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9coule de sa d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant, qui \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e en partie sur un motif discriminatoire \u2013 que le cong\u00e9diement juste ait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 justifi\u00e9 ou non par l\u2019arbitre du travail.\n[95] Plut\u00f4t que de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019audience une preuve ou des observations au sujet du calcul de ces dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, les parties ont convenu de travailler ensemble \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer ceux\u2011ci. Comme je l\u2019explique ci\u2011dessous, je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence pour le cas o\u00f9 leurs discussions ne seraient pas fructueuses.\nC. Le pr\u00e9judice moral [96] Les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte sont survenus avant les modifications dont la Loi a fait l\u2019objet en 1998. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le paragraphe 53(3) pr\u00e9voyait que le Tribunal ne pouvait ordonner le versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 de plus de 5 000 $ pour compenser le pr\u00e9judice moral subi par la victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire. Je fais miennes les conclusions du Tribunal dans les affaires Premakumar c. Air Canada[34] et Desormeaux[35], \u00e0 savoir que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 5 000 $ doit \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux pires cas parmi ceux pour lesquels une telle indemnit\u00e9 est justifi\u00e9e.\n[97] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 les incidences de son cong\u00e9diement sur sa vie. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 dans sa dignit\u00e9 et a craint pour le bien-\u00eatre \u00e9conomique de sa famille. Les cons\u00e9quences financi\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 telles qu\u2019il a eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 acheter de la nourriture convenable pour sa famille. Par ailleurs, la preuve n\u2019indique pas que le cong\u00e9diement a fait r\u00e9appara\u00eetre le SSPT. Au contraire, le Dr Erickson a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le plaignant [TRADUCTION] se porte extr\u00eamement bien .\n[98] Compte tenu de ces consid\u00e9rations et de toutes les autres circonstances entourant cette affaire, j\u2019ordonne que l\u2019intim\u00e9e verse au plaignant la somme de 3 500 $ en guise d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale.\nD. La r\u00e9vision de la politique [99] La Commission demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner que la politique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant les mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s atteints de d\u00e9ficience soit examin\u00e9e et r\u00e9vis\u00e9e. Plus de sept ann\u00e9es se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis le cong\u00e9diement du plaignant. La preuve indique que, depuis ce temps, l\u2019employeur n\u2019est plus le m\u00eame (Ville d\u2019Ottawa maintenant) et que les politiques sur les mesures d\u2019adaptation et les programmes de gestion des pr\u00e9sences ont fait l\u2019objet de plusieurs modifications et mises \u00e0 jour. Le nouveau programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des employ\u00e9s de la Ville d\u2019Ottawa, et non pas seulement \u00e0 ceux qui travaillent chez OC Transpo. En outre, la responsabilit\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9coule en partie du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas appliqu\u00e9 le programme qui \u00e9tait en place au moment du cong\u00e9diement du plaignant et n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une lacune particuli\u00e8re dans le programme proprement dit. Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de la Commission est rejet\u00e9e.\nE. Le versement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats [100] Des int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans le cadre de cette d\u00e9cision.

En ce qui concerne l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral, les int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent courir \u00e0 compter de la date du cong\u00e9diement, et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du versement final de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.

(TNA), all\u00e9guant que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne lui a pas assur\u00e9 un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement et a ainsi contrevenu aux obligations impos\u00e9es par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Elle a \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que son employeur l\u2019a trait\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et pr\u00e9judiciable et a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison de sa grossesse. Mme Hodgins a par la suite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019autres plaintes contre les ex\u2011propri\u00e9taires de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Ken et Karen Dragosists, all\u00e9guant que M. et Mme Dragosists l\u2019avaient tous deux harcel\u00e9e sexuellement dans le cours de son emploi chez TNA.\n[2] Dans le cadre des pr\u00e9paratifs en vue de l\u2019audience sur les plaintes de Mme Hodgins, le greffe du Tribunal a fait parvenir \u00e0 chacune des parties des questionnaires \u00e0 remplir. Ni M. Dragosists ni Mme Dragosists n\u2019ont r\u00e9pondu et ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre n\u2019ont fourni jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant d\u2019indications quant \u00e0 leur intention de participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience. TNA a retourn\u00e9 le questionnaire d\u00fbment rempli. Par ailleurs, David Bazar, l\u2019un des propri\u00e9taires actuels de TNA, a demand\u00e9 que la Commission supprime le nom de TNA en tant qu\u2019un des intim\u00e9s dans cette affaire, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne peut \u00e0 son avis jouer un r\u00f4le utile \u00e0 ce titre. Comme la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, je comprends que TNA demande au Tribunal une ordonnance en vue de rejeter la plainte dont elle est l\u2019objet, et j\u2019ai trait\u00e9 la correspondance de M. Bazar comme une requ\u00eate en ce sens.\n[3] Les observations de TNA sont tr\u00e8s br\u00e8ves. Bien qu\u2019on lui ait offert la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations plus compl\u00e8tes \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, M. Bazar a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas le faire. Je dois donc examiner la requ\u00eate en me fondant sur le peu de renseignements dont je dispose.\n[4] M. Bazar a indiqu\u00e9 que sa femme et lui ont acquis le contr\u00f4le de Transport North American Express Inc. apr\u00e8s les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits dans la plainte de Mme Hodgins. Par cons\u00e9quent, ni M. Bazar ni sa femme ne connaissent les faits entourant les all\u00e9gations de Mme Hodgins. Au dire de M. Bazar, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019actif de TNA ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis en juillet dernier \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande de remboursement de la Banque de Montr\u00e9al qui, de toute \u00e9vidence, \u00e9tait un cr\u00e9ancier garanti de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. M. Bazar a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019actif de TNA ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 liquid\u00e9s par un syndic. \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019a pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019actif ou d\u2019employ\u00e9s et ne g\u00e9n\u00e8re plus de revenus.\n[5] Les arguments de la Commission sont fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que TNA a bel et bien fait faillite. Cependant, M. Bazar n\u2019a pas affirm\u00e9 que TNA avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait faillite. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 me pencher sur les r\u00e9percussions qu\u2019une telle faillite pourrait avoir sur la pr\u00e9sente instance. Il se peut fort bien que le syndic mentionn\u00e9 dans la correspondance de M. Bazar ait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 en vertu du contrat de garantie de la Banque, aux fins de r\u00e9aliser la garantie de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[6] TNA \u00e9tait l\u2019employeur de Mme Hodgins. En vertu du paragraphe 65(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l\u2019employeur est responsable du harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail dans le cas o\u00f9 celui\u2011ci est fond\u00e9 sur un ou plusieurs motifs illicites \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il puisse satisfaire aux crit\u00e8res de d\u00e9fense bas\u00e9s sur la diligence n\u00e9cessaire \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 65(2) de la Loi. Le changement de contr\u00f4le dont TNA a fait l\u2019objet depuis le moment o\u00f9 Mme Hodgins a quitt\u00e9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne lib\u00e8re pas pour autant cette derni\u00e8re de la responsabilit\u00e9 de toute conduite discriminatoire qui a pu survenir auparavant au sein du milieu de travail.\n[7] M. Bazar a affirm\u00e9 que M. et Mme Dragosists ne sont plus associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qu\u2019un litige oppose actuellement cette derni\u00e8re aux Dragosists. Par cons\u00e9quent, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019est pas en mesure, selon M. Bazar, de citer des t\u00e9moins pour se d\u00e9fendre. Cependant, rien n\u2019indique que les Dragosists ne sont pas disponibles pour t\u00e9moigner. Il est loisible \u00e0 TNA de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre les Dragosists, si elle estime que leur t\u00e9moignage est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 sa d\u00e9fense.\n[8] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de TNA en vue du rejet de la plainte contre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est rejet\u00e9e. Cependant, compte tenu du peu de renseignements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal relativement aux circonstances entourant le changement de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de TNA, je rejette la requ\u00eate sous r\u00e9serve du droit de TNA de la renouveler \u00e0 l\u2019audience, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle pourrait \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par une preuve plus compl\u00e8te.\n[9] Vu l\u2019all\u00e9gation de M. Bazar selon laquelle TNA n\u2019a ni \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019actif ni revenus, Mme Hodgins et la Commission voudront peut-\u00eatre examiner s\u2019il est utile d\u2019impliquer TNA en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Toutefois, c\u2019est l\u00e0 une d\u00e9cision qui appartient \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 Mme Hodgins, et non \u00e0 ce Tribunal.\nAnne Mactavish\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 6 mars 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL NO :\nT745\/5002, T746\/5102 et T747\/5202\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nTara Hodgins c.

La plaignante s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e aux deux demandes. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les observations de toutes les parties, j\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 la demande de huis clos et ordonn\u00e9 une interdiction de publication. J\u2019ai inform\u00e9 les parties que je fournirais des motifs \u00e9crits \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure.\n[2] L\u2019affaire est r\u00e9gie par le paragraphe 52(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, qui conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir de :\n52.(1) [\u2026] prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction s\u2019il est convaincu que, selon le cas :\n[\u2026]\nb) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux d\u2019atteinte au droit \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher la divulgation de renseignements l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique;\nc) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique;\nd) il y a une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger par la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont reconnu qu\u2019il leur incombait d\u2019\u00e9tablir la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une ordonnance prot\u00e9geant la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction, et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un lourd fardeau de preuve. Ils ont aussi reconnu qu\u2019une telle ordonnance ne devrait pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres moyens de prot\u00e9ger les parties et les t\u00e9moins.\n[3] La demande dont je suis saisi soul\u00e8ve diff\u00e9rents int\u00e9r\u00eats. La premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats qui militent en faveur de la publication semble relever du domaine public. La common law repose sur un processus ind\u00e9pendant, impartial et public. Des consid\u00e9rations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (la \u00ab Charte \u00bb) entrent aussi en jeu. On m\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la garantie de libert\u00e9 de la presse pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte, qui exige de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que le processus d\u00e9cisionnel soit men\u00e9 en public. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 2b) va peut-\u00eatre plus loin, cependant, puisqu\u2019il prot\u00e8ge la libert\u00e9 d\u2019opinion et d\u2019expression, ce qui est impossible sans un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information qui permet cette expression.\n[4] La deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats qui militent en faveur de la publication rel\u00e8ve du domaine priv\u00e9. Par exemple, l\u2019article 11 de la Charte garantit \u00e0 tout inculp\u00e9 le droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s public. On peut trouver un droit similaire dans la proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, qui accorde au plaignant ou \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 le droit de demander une audience publique. L\u2019article 7 de la Charte pourrait aussi comporter un certain droit \u00e0 une audience publique, dans le cas o\u00f9 cet aspect aurait des r\u00e9percussions sur l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 psychologique des participants. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Blencoe c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Human Rights Commission) [2002] 2 R.C.S. 307, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que rien ne s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019article 7 dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne lorsque les circonstances le justifient.\n[5] Du point de vue oppos\u00e9, la plupart des pr\u00e9occupations en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont trait \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e de la personne. Il est int\u00e9ressant de constater que l\u2019article 7 peut aussi entrer en jeu dans un tel contexte, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il prot\u00e8ge l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 psychologique de la personne qui pourrait \u00eatre compromise par un processus ouvert. Le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)d) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb), qui reprend les m\u00eames termes que l\u2019article 7, le confirme. On m\u2019a aussi renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 8 de la Charte, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e de la personne.\n[6] La question de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 semble se poser des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de la question, puisque le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats semble \u00eatre n\u00e9 de la croyance selon laquelle des audiences publiques sont sujettes \u00e0 un examen minutieux et sont donc intrins\u00e8quement plus \u00e9quitables que les audiences \u00e0 huis clos. La Chambre \u00e9toil\u00e9e occupe une place importante dans notre histoire juridique. Les intim\u00e9s ont fait valoir, au contraire, qu\u2019un processus public qui d\u00e9truit la r\u00e9putation de parties innocentes est fondamentalement intrusif et injuste. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019une audience qui permet la publication d\u2019all\u00e9gations extravagantes et injustifi\u00e9es est in\u00e9quitable, m\u00eame si elle offre \u00e0 toutes les parties une occasion compl\u00e8te et suffisante de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il est \u00e9vident que la notion d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)b) de la Loi va au-del\u00e0 des simples questions de proc\u00e9dure.\nI. La r\u00e8gle fondamentale\n[7] Malgr\u00e9 le large \u00e9ventail d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats qui entrent en jeu dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la r\u00e8gle fondamentale applicable semble tout \u00e0 fait claire. Les audiences doivent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement se d\u00e9rouler en public. Plus que toute autre chose, il s\u2019agit de rendre des comptes. Le processus ne doit pas \u00eatre cach\u00e9; j\u2019estime que c\u2019est par l\u00e0 qu\u2019il faut commencer. Le mandat d\u2019organismes d\u2019enqu\u00eate comme le Tribunal est d\u2019\u00e9tablir publiquement les faits qui se sont produits dans un ensemble de circonstances donn\u00e9. \u00c0 mon avis, cela n\u00e9cessite un processus ouvert, dans lequel les positions concurrentes sont soumises \u00e0 l\u2019examen du public.\n[8] Ce principe est valable, que les all\u00e9gations soient fond\u00e9es ou non. Le droit de savoir du public n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9 aux conclusions d\u2019un tribunal, et il englobe g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es, aussi offensantes puissent-elles \u00eatre. D\u2019autres pr\u00e9occupations entrent en jeu dans le contexte des droits de la personne, puisque l\u2019un des objectifs des proc\u00e9dures en la mati\u00e8re est de sensibiliser le public. Par ailleurs, les consid\u00e9rations de cette nature s\u2019appliquent dans toutes les affaires et ne sont pas limit\u00e9es aux cas o\u00f9 le bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte est \u00e9tabli. Dans les situations o\u00f9 les plaintes ne sont pas retenues, les objectifs \u00e9ducatifs d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne sont quand m\u00eame servis par des audiences publiques.\n[9] La question est donc de savoir si les circonstances de l\u2019affaire dont je suis saisi sont suffisantes pour justifier une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il me suffit, pour pouvoir me prononcer, de consulter les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 52(1) de la Loi, en restant attentif \u00e0 toute consid\u00e9ration li\u00e9e \u00e0 la Charte.\nII. Huis clos\n[10] Pour d\u00e9cider de la demande de huis clos, je ne vois aucune n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019aller au-del\u00e0 des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Le public jouit d\u2019un certain droit de savoir ce qui se passe lors des audiences. Des all\u00e9gations offensantes sont soulev\u00e9es dans de nombreuses affaires et, pour justifier le huis clos, il faut quelque chose de plus. Une proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne devrait \u00eatre ouverte au public en toutes circonstances, sauf les plus imp\u00e9rieuses. J\u2019estime que l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et la r\u00e9putation de la proc\u00e9dure seraient compromises si le huis clos \u00e9tait d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 simplement parce que des audiences traitent de questions personnelles d\u00e9licates. L\u2019une des cons\u00e9quences du huis clos serait la mise sous scell\u00e9s de la transcription dans son ensemble, une mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der qui a pour effet d\u2019effacer l\u2019audience du dossier public. C\u2019est aller beaucoup trop loin.\n[11] Dans l\u2019affaire Bouvier c. M\u00e9tro Express, (1992) 17 CHRR 313, au paragraphe 6, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 une demande similaire qui visait \u00e0 obtenir le huis clos en vertu d\u2019un article ant\u00e9rieur et plus aust\u00e8re de la Loi, au motif, semble-t-il, que le processus risquerait de porter atteinte \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 le huis clos en ces termes :\nVu l\u2019importance primordiale du caract\u00e8re public du processus judiciaire dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, tout particuli\u00e8rement dans le domaine des droits de la personne o\u00f9 l\u2019aspect \u00e9ducatif de ce processus joue un r\u00f4le de premier plan, et vu les arr\u00eats Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse c. MacIntyre, 1982 CanLII 14 (CSC), [1982] 1 R.C.S. 175 et Edmonton Journal c. Alberta, 1989 CanLII 20 (CSC), [1989] 2 R.C.S. 1326, nous avons refus\u00e9 la demande de huis clos pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Loomis.\nJe pense qu\u2019il existe un droit du public \u00e0 l\u2019examen, qui accorde aux simples citoyens le droit d\u2019assister aux instances judiciaires et d\u2019observer le fonctionnement du syst\u00e8me.\n[12] Il est impossible de le faire \u00e0 huis clos, et ce serait une erreur de pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019en fait, l\u2019audience n\u2019a pas eu lieu. Si les intim\u00e9s sont tout \u00e0 fait sans tache et au-del\u00e0 de tout reproche, cela ne change rien au fait que ces all\u00e9gations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es. Je ne suis pas convaincu que les intim\u00e9s seront bl\u00e2m\u00e9s d\u2019avoir rendu ce fait public, puisqu\u2019il peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons. J\u2019estime que nous devons nous fier \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 du public de faire la part des choses entre de simples all\u00e9gations et des d\u00e9clarations de fait. Si un membre du public devait confondre les deux, les intim\u00e9s auraient \u00e0 leur disposition les voies de recours civiles habituelles.\n[13] La plaignante a ouvertement exprim\u00e9 son manque de confiance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une audience \u00e0 huis clos et a insist\u00e9 sur son droit de confronter les intim\u00e9s en public. Elle a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites dans lesquelles elle faisait valoir que ce serait une erreur de [traduction] \u00ab cacher \u00bb l\u2019audience au public. Ces observations m\u2019apparaissent fond\u00e9es. Le fait que des all\u00e9gations de cette nature soient formul\u00e9es au cours d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ne devrait pas \u00eatre dissimul\u00e9 au public. Ce raisonnement va au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019audience et englobe la transcription de l\u2019instruction, qui devrait pouvoir \u00eatre examin\u00e9e. Cela sert l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 52, mais aussi les finalit\u00e9s juridiques et historiques des audiences.\n[14] Avant de me pencher sur la demande d\u2019ordonnance de non-publication, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que j\u2019ai \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ordonner un huis clos bref, advenant que des all\u00e9gations particuli\u00e8res remplissent les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 52(1) de la Loi. On m\u2019a toutefois inform\u00e9 que cette solution serait peu pratique, vu le nombre d\u2019all\u00e9gations, et qu\u2019elle entra\u00eenerait des interruptions constantes du processus. Il faudrait aussi que des parties de la transcription soient mises sous scell\u00e9s et retir\u00e9es du dossier public. Je ne suis pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise avec une telle fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, et j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de donner au public l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la transcription, laquelle pourrait toujours faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une interdiction de publication. Je crois que cela va aussi loin que possible pour prot\u00e9ger \u00e0 la fois les int\u00e9r\u00eats des parties et le droit de savoir du public.\nIII. L\u2019interdiction de publication\n[15] La publication semble \u00eatre une question distincte. L\u2019intim\u00e9 m\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Dagenais c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio\u2011Canada, [1994] A.C.S. no 104 (QL), qui concernait une ordonnance interdisant \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio\u2011Canada de diffuser une \u00e9mission de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision traitant de l\u2019objet d\u2019une accusation en mati\u00e8re criminelle. M\u00eame si les faits de cet arr\u00eat n\u2019ont pas de r\u00e9elle incidence sur l\u2019affaire dont je suis saisi, la d\u00e9cision de la majorit\u00e9 \u00e9nonce le crit\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 appliquer \u00e0 une requ\u00eate de ce type. Ainsi, une ordonnance de non\u2011publication ne devrait \u00eatre rendue que si :\n1) elle est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9carter le risque que le proc\u00e8s ou l\u2019audience soit in\u00e9quitable;\n2) ses effets b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques sont plus importants que ses effets pr\u00e9judiciables sur la libre expression de ceux qui sont touch\u00e9s par l\u2019ordonnance.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont fait valoir que ce crit\u00e8re \u00e9tablit les param\u00e8tres fondamentaux de toute demande d\u2019ordonnance de non\u2011publication.\n[16] Des pr\u00e9occupations de m\u00eame nature d\u00e9coulent des alin\u00e9as 52(1)b) et c) de la Loi, o\u00f9 un libell\u00e9 quelque peu diff\u00e9rent est n\u00e9anmoins utilis\u00e9. L\u2019article dispose qu\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e si \u00ab la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher la divulgation de renseignements l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique \u00bb. Cette disposition reconna\u00eet qu\u2019une telle n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 peut se pr\u00e9senter dans les situations o\u00f9 \u00ab il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux d\u2019atteinte au droit \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable \u00bb, ou encore \u00ab un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres \u00bb susceptible de causer un pr\u00e9judice indu aux personnes concern\u00e9es. Bien que l\u2019alin\u00e9a d) puisse soulever des pr\u00e9occupations de m\u00eame nature, j\u2019estime suffisant de me concentrer sur les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes consid\u00e9rations.\n[17] On constatera que l\u2019affaire Dagenais et bien d\u2019autres traitent de la libert\u00e9 de la presse. \u00c0 mon sens, il serait imprudent de faire des commentaires sur cet aspect de la question, en l\u2019absence d\u2019observations de la part d\u2019une partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e qui pourrait faire valoir les \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires au nom de la presse. Comme l\u2019affaire Dagenais est une affaire criminelle, elle met aussi l\u2019accent sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019inculp\u00e9, ce qui fait intervenir la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence garantie par l\u2019article 11 de la Charte. La principale d\u00e9cision sur laquelle les intim\u00e9s se fondent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est A. v. C. [1994] B.C.J. no 488 (B.C.S.C.) (QL), o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une poursuite en diffamation d\u00e9coulant de plaintes extravagantes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la police et du Coll\u00e8ge des m\u00e9decins et fond\u00e9es sur des violences sexuelles all\u00e9gu\u00e9es. Le tribunal avait ordonn\u00e9 l\u2019utilisation de pseudonymes. L\u2019affaire m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e au soutien de la proposition voulant que la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence ait pour effet de prot\u00e9ger les parties dans les instances civiles.\n[18] Je ne peux analyser l\u2019affaire en d\u00e9tail. Au paragraphe 23, la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a n\u00e9anmoins adopt\u00e9 le point de vue exprim\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Hirt v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, [1985] 3 W.W.R. 350, \u00e0 la page 364, o\u00f9 le juge d\u2019appel McFarlane d\u00e9clare :\n[traduction]\nL\u2019acc\u00e8s du public aux tribunaux et aux dossiers des tribunaux est n\u00e9cessaire pour que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 puisse avoir l\u2019assurance que justice a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue. Le secret suscite des doutes dans l\u2019esprit du public, mais dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s libres et d\u00e9mocratiques, on reconna\u00eet depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es qu\u2019il existe des limites raisonnables au principe selon lequel la justice doit \u00eatre rendue au grand jour. La v\u00e9ritable justice doit respecter les droits ou la r\u00e9putation des personnes innocentes.\nBien que l\u2019affaire traite de plusieurs autres questions, voil\u00e0 la proposition essentielle qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise.\n[19] Les avocats des intim\u00e9s ont fond\u00e9 la plupart de leurs observations sur la r\u00e9putation et l\u2019innocence des personnes que la plaignante accuse d\u2019inconduite grave et d\u2019inconvenances sexuelles [traduction] \u00ab scandaleuses \u00bb. Les intim\u00e9s ont fait valoir que la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence qui s\u2019applique dans un contexte criminel s\u2019applique aussi aux all\u00e9gations m\u00e9prisables formul\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019autres instances. Par exemple, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 mon attention que deux des t\u00e9moins faisaient l\u2019objet de plaintes distinctes aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. La Commission n\u2019a pas poursuivi l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur ces plaintes, et celles-ci n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal. Les intim\u00e9s m\u2019ont donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre que leurs t\u00e9moins \u00e9taient maintenant [traduction] \u00ab replong\u00e9s \u00bb dans le processus contre leur gr\u00e9.\n[20] Des arguments de cet ordre paraissent plus convaincants dans une affaire de harc\u00e8lement, o\u00f9 les droits de la personne entrent parfois dans la sph\u00e8re de certaines all\u00e9gations habituellement trait\u00e9es par des instances criminelles. Par exemple, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je suis saisi d\u2019all\u00e9gations de viol et de sodomie forc\u00e9e. Le v\u00e9ritable point en litige semble \u00eatre les all\u00e9gations de nature sexuelle. On a fait valoir que de telles all\u00e9gations entra\u00eenaient une stigmatisation particuli\u00e8re dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, de sorte que le couvert de la confidentialit\u00e9 se justifiait plus ais\u00e9ment que pour d\u2019autres all\u00e9gations. M. Houston a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 officiellement que des [traduction] \u00ab all\u00e9gations horribles \u00bb seraient formul\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins, y compris, peut-\u00eatre, des all\u00e9gations de maltraitance d\u2019enfants.\n[21] La plaignante elle-m\u00eame peut avoir des int\u00e9r\u00eats concurrents. Dans l\u2019affaire Bouvier, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 7, le Tribunal a cit\u00e9 l\u2019affaire Edmonton Journal c. Alberta, [1989] 2 R.C.S. 1326, p. 1361, dans laquelle madame la juge Wilson avait reconnu qu\u2019un processus public pouvait servir des int\u00e9r\u00eats plus personnels :\nMais en plus de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans un processus judiciaire public, il peut y avoir des arguments imp\u00e9rieux en sa faveur qui concernent les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019ensemble des plaideurs. Beaucoup d\u2019entre eux se sentent d\u00e9dommag\u00e9s moralement par la r\u00e9v\u00e9lation publique des injustices qu\u2019ils estiment avoir subies seuls et sans aucun secours de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. En effet, c\u2019est peut-\u00eatre la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019un conjoint peut parler ouvertement d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s dans l\u2019intimit\u00e9 du domicile. Ils peuvent se sentir r\u00e9confort\u00e9s par l\u2019appui public que leur donne le syst\u00e8me contre des humiliations qu\u2019ils ont subies en priv\u00e9. (Page 1361.)\nLes intim\u00e9s ont essentiellement fait valoir qu\u2019il fallait se garder d\u2019aller trop loin en ce sens. Un plaignant ne devrait pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 punir publiquement un intim\u00e9 ou des tiers innocents lorsque le bien-fond\u00e9 des plaintes n\u2019est pas \u00e9tabli. L\u2019audience n\u2019est pas non plus un exercice th\u00e9rapeutique. Il y a un risque \u2014 du moins dans certains cas \u2014 que le processus juridictionnel soit utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 des fins inappropri\u00e9es ou parall\u00e8les.\n[22] La version fran\u00e7aise de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) semble soutenir un tel argument. Un exercice de pond\u00e9ration s\u2019impose. Je suis n\u00e9anmoins d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est possible de r\u00e9pondre, au moins en partie, aux int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u00e9crits par madame la juge Wilson en permettant \u00e0 la plaignante de formuler ses all\u00e9gations en public, avec ou sans ordonnance de non-publication. Les parties ont le droit de se faire entendre en justice. Les remarques de la juge Wilson n\u2019ont pas emp\u00each\u00e9 le Tribunal, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bouvier, de rendre une ordonnance de non-publication partielle dans des circonstances moins imp\u00e9rieuses que celles qui nous occupent. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, il est impossible de proc\u00e9der ainsi dans l\u2019affaire dont je suis saisi, vu l\u2019\u00e9tendue des all\u00e9gations et la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire dans la collectivit\u00e9 locale. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que je pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerais rendre une ordonnance de non\u2011publication plut\u00f4t que d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition le huis clos pour certaines parties des t\u00e9moignages.\n[23] Un autre aspect de la question requiert toutefois un examen s\u00e9rieux. La plaignante s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9. Comme les intim\u00e9s l\u2019ont fait valoir, il existe n\u00e9anmoins de bonnes raisons de prot\u00e9ger sa vie priv\u00e9e dans cette affaire. Tout au long de l\u2019instance, les intim\u00e9s ont soutenu que la plaignante souffre de [traduction] \u00ab maladie mentale \u00bb et d\u2019id\u00e9es d\u00e9lirantes. On m\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle serait contre\u2011interrog\u00e9e sur les moindres d\u00e9tails de sa vie personnelle et de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents psychologiques, ce qui soul\u00e8ve de tr\u00e8s graves pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de protection de la vie priv\u00e9e. Je reconnais la position adopt\u00e9e par la plaignante : elle s\u2019est tout de m\u00eame oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 la divulgation des d\u00e9tails de son dossier m\u00e9dical et psychologique. Il me semble qu\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 lui procurerait une certaine protection sous ce rapport.\n[24] Je ne puis faire de remarques sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire dont je suis saisi. Je n\u2019ai toutefois aucun doute que de nombreuses personnes innocentes ont pu subir d\u2019\u00e9normes dommages personnels et publics \u00e0 la suite d\u2019all\u00e9gations de nature sexuelle, qui ont un caract\u00e8re ignominieux pour notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il ne faudrait pas sous-estimer la honte et l\u2019humiliation que ces personnes subissent, et le syst\u00e8me ne devrait pas les victimiser. J\u2019estime que les int\u00e9r\u00eats du public et, peut-\u00eatre, de la plaignante peuvent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par un r\u00e9examen de la question \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience, o\u00f9 toute interdiction de publication pourra \u00eatre lev\u00e9e. Je note au passage que les avocats des intim\u00e9s ont exprim\u00e9 une pr\u00e9occupation suppl\u00e9mentaire concernant le langage employ\u00e9 par la plaignante pour formuler les all\u00e9gations en cause, ainsi qu\u2019une pr\u00e9occupation ayant trait \u00e0 des accusations moins pr\u00e9judiciables comme le vol. Je ne crois pas que ces pr\u00e9occupations soient suffisantes pour justifier une ordonnance de non-publication.\nIV. D\u00e9cision\n[25] En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019interdis la publication de tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ou de toute question susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre soulev\u00e9e au cours de la pr\u00e9sente audience. J\u2019estime que cela est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de toutes les parties, y compris de la plaignante, et que la publication compromettrait l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction et causerait un pr\u00e9judice indu aux personnes concern\u00e9es. En l\u2019occurrence, je suis convaincu que de telles consid\u00e9rations l\u2019emportent sur les r\u00e8gles normales en faveur d\u2019une audience publique.\n[26] Je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que cette interdiction est r\u00e9vocable, et qu\u2019elle peut \u00eatre reconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e si d\u2019autres parties souhaitent aborder la question, ou encore si les circonstances de l\u2019audience le justifient. Elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tend \u00e0 aucune de mes conclusions ni \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision finale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPaul Groarke\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 7 mars 2003\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal :\nT627\/1501 and T628\/1601\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause:\nAmanda Day c.

LA REQU\u00caTE DONT JE SUIS SAISI [1] Les paragraphes suivants \u00e9noncent mes motifs de d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate des intim\u00e9s visant \u00e0 obtenir une d\u00e9cision ayant pour effet de d\u00e9clarer que l'intim\u00e9e est inhabile \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, plut\u00f4t, formuler la question en termes de capacit\u00e9 et \u00e9viter les associations p\u00e9joratives avec le mot en usage dans la jurisprudence. Une deuxi\u00e8me question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans ce contexte, la question de savoir si la plaignante a la capacit\u00e9 de se repr\u00e9senter elle-m\u00eame. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, je ne crois pas qu'il serait dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties d'interrompre la proc\u00e9dure pour r\u00e9diger des motifs \u00e9labor\u00e9s. Toutefois, je me sens tenu de rendre des motifs \u00e9crits avant de poursuivre la proc\u00e9dure.\n[2] Avant de traiter du contexte de la requ\u00eate, je ferai observer que la deuxi\u00e8me question pourrait sembler exiger un degr\u00e9 plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de capacit\u00e9, puisqu'une partie qui est habile \u00e0 poursuivre une proc\u00e9dure doit \u00eatre capable de participer \u00e0 son d\u00e9roulement. Cela semblerait normalement exiger l'atteinte d'une norme plus rigoureuse que la simple capacit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des t\u00e9moignages probants, \u00e0 savoir une capacit\u00e9 simplement suffisante pour aider le juge des faits. La logique habituelle des circonstances semble toutefois invers\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances dont je suis saisi. Cette inversion d\u00e9coule du fait que la principale difficult\u00e9 de la plaignante, comme l'a soutenu Mme Thayer, r\u00e9side dans le r\u00e9cit des all\u00e9gations sexuelles qui sont au c\u0153ur de la plainte. Il s'agit l\u00e0 sans nul doute de l'aspect le plus difficile de l'affaire, d'un point de vue juridique.\n[3] Bien que j'aie plus directement cibl\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re question, qui concerne l'aptitude de la plaignante \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, les faits sont qu'il existe une pr\u00e9occupation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale quant \u00e0 son \u00e9tat psychologique, ladite pr\u00e9occupation s'\u00e9tendant \u00e0 tous les aspects de la cause. Je veux rassurer la plaignante et lui faire savoir qu'\u00e0 mon avis, les autres parties ont agi en vue de pr\u00e9server l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure et d'une mani\u00e8re qui tenait hautement compte du bien-\u00eatre de la plaignante. Il n'y a rien d'irr\u00e9gulier dans la requ\u00eate dont je suis saisi : au contraire, je crois qu'il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 de poursuivre sans examiner les questions qu'elle soul\u00e8ve. Cela demeure vrai, quelle que soit ma d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate.\nII. CONTEXTE G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL DE LA CAUSE [4] Il convient que je pr\u00e9cise d'abord que les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de la pr\u00e9sente affaire semblent parsem\u00e9s de complications. Il est impossible d'ignorer que les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents psychologiques de la plaignante sont pertinents \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Le dossier m\u00e9dical, qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 av\u00e9r\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante, r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 intern\u00e9e. Cela ne sert \u00e0 rien de cacher le fait : il ne porte pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 cons\u00e9quence dans les circonstances pr\u00e9sentes de la plaignante et, pour autant que je sache, les avocats ne laissent pas entendre qu'elle est inhabile au sens juridique large de ce terme. Ce point sert simplement \u00e0 poser le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et \u00e0 illustrer, avec le reste du dossier m\u00e9dical et psychologique, qu'il existe des motifs de pr\u00e9occupation.\n[5] Bien que je n'aie pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant des faits qui peuvent avoir transpir\u00e9 avant l'audience, la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que la Commission des droits de la personne et les autres parties ont tent\u00e9 d'obtenir une ordonnance qui aurait eu pour effet de la d\u00e9clarer inhabile. Je n'exag\u00e8re pas en disant qu'elle a l'impression qu'il y a un genre de conspiration en vue de l'interner. Je ne connais pas tous les d\u00e9tails de cette histoire, mais le dossier du Tribunal contient suffisamment d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui portent \u00e0 croire que les doutes de la plaignante ne sont pas d\u00e9nu\u00e9s de fondement. Ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de ne se veut pas une critique : la pr\u00e9sente affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile pour toutes les personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es et je me sens simplement tenu d'\u00e9tablir les circonstances globales dans lesquelles s'inscrit la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[6] La plaignante a in\u00e9vitablement l'impression que tous les efforts pass\u00e9s visant \u00e0 ce qu'elle soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inhabile \u00e9taient simplement un moyen commode de mettre fin \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instruction. Il s'ensuit qu'elle trouve extr\u00eamement suspecte la pr\u00e9sente tentative des autres parties de mettre en doute sa capacit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 l'audience. Elle est d'avis qu'il est profitable pour son bien-\u00eatre psychologique de continuer et il existe au moins une preuve d'ordre m\u00e9dical qui corrobore une telle pr\u00e9tention. Il en d\u00e9coule des questions qui d\u00e9passent le champ de ma comp\u00e9tence, toutefois, et la position juridique de la plaignante est qu'elle a le droit de poursuivre. Ce droit inclut le droit de t\u00e9moigner et de pr\u00e9senter sa version des faits. Je l'ai avertie qu'elle serait assujettie \u00e0 un contre-interrogatoire complet, visant \u00e0 approfondir les faits, qui allait sans nul doute remuer des souvenirs douloureux et \u00eatre difficile au plan affectif. Cela ne l'a pas dissuad\u00e9e.\nIII. CONTEXTE DE LA PR\u00c9SENTE REQU\u00caTE [7] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate a certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e selon les r\u00e8gles et d'une mani\u00e8re responsable. La plaignante a affich\u00e9 un comportement excentrique lorsqu'elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa preuve principale. Cette pr\u00e9sentation a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des contorsions faciales, des pauses non indiqu\u00e9es, de forts hochements de t\u00eate, elle a lev\u00e9 les bras et affich\u00e9 diverses attitudes corporelles, le tout s'\u00e9cartant de la pr\u00e9sentation normale d'une preuve de vive voix. Je mentionne les attributs susmentionn\u00e9s de son t\u00e9moignage puisqu'ils ne ressortent pas au vu du dossier. La plaignante a aussi prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des jurons, a parfois commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 sangloter, a parfois lev\u00e9 le ton ou adopt\u00e9 un ton moqueur ou \u00e9voquant des effets de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, et n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de poursuivre \u00e0 un certain nombre de reprises. L'aspect de sa preuve qui soul\u00e8ve le plus de difficult\u00e9, du point de vue de la gestion de la cause, se rapporte au fait qu'elle a trouv\u00e9 difficile, et m\u00eame impossible, de s'en tenir \u00e0 une narration des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Elle a sans cesse bifurqu\u00e9 sur d'autres questions, parfois d'une mani\u00e8re qui aurait sembl\u00e9 \u00e9trange et m\u00eame bizarre pour quiconque a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 le sens de la pertinence.\n[8] J'admets, comme les avocats l'ont soutenu, que le comportement de la plaignante s'est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9 au fil de la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve et a en bout de ligne culmin\u00e9 dans ce que je d\u00e9cris au dossier comme un acc\u00e8s de hurlements, qui est survenu lorsqu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de d\u00e9crire un des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Selon moi, le qualificatif informes est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9crire ces hurlements : ils ne v\u00e9hiculaient aucun mot, \u00e0 ma connaissance, et pour quelqu'un qui n'est pas un expert, du moins, la plaignante pleurait \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re d'un enfant, un enfant inconsolable. L'agente du greffe a imm\u00e9diatement fait un appel \u00e0 l'ordre et j'ai quitt\u00e9 la salle d'audience, bien que selon toute \u00e9vidence, elle se soit \u00e9croul\u00e9e sur le plancher, se tordant dans des convulsions, selon les dires des avocats et y restant jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les personnes pr\u00e9sentes aient quitt\u00e9 la salle. Le Dr Kaplan, un psychologue t\u00e9moignant au nom des intim\u00e9s, a conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agente du greffe d'appeler le 911, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Il ne faut pas interpr\u00e9ter ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de comme une observation sur la nature de ce qui est arriv\u00e9, et qui est devenu source de controverse entre les parties.\n[9] Un des agents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, Mme Dennis, est demeur\u00e9e dans la salle d'audience et a plus tard t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage pond\u00e9r\u00e9 et des preuves prudentes, et j'accueille son expos\u00e9 sur ce qui s'est alors pass\u00e9. Le seul point que je me sens tenu de clarifier est le fait que l'audience n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reprise en l'absence de la plaignante. Cette possibilit\u00e9 n'est jamais entr\u00e9e en ligne de compte, bien que les choses auraient pu se passer diff\u00e9remment si Mme Day avait \u00e9t\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9e. Selon moi, l'affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e en conformit\u00e9 avec un degr\u00e9 convenable de souci pour le bien-\u00eatre de la plaignante et pour la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server le bien-fond\u00e9 de l'instance. Une fois la plaignante r\u00e9tablie, l'audience a repris bri\u00e8vement, et la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle souhaitait poursuivre la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve. Les autres parties, on peut le comprendre, ont demand\u00e9 une suspension d'audience. La plaignante est devenue visiblement en col\u00e8re en r\u00e9action aux observations des avocats, et j'ai cru qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de suspendre l'audience jusqu'au lendemain, le jour o\u00f9 les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[10] Je veux \u00eatre juste. En un certain sens, toute cette affaire se trouve ainsi plac\u00e9e sous son plus mauvais jour. Je veux exprimer clairement que la plaignante est une personne intelligente qui parle souvent d'une mani\u00e8re lucide et qui per\u00e7oit v\u00e9ritablement la nature et l'objet de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage coh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l'appui des plaintes. Un des aspects du probl\u00e8me est qu'elle ne conna\u00eet pas bien les coutumes propres aux instances juridiques formelles et, comme beaucoup de gens ordinaires, qu'elle n'est pas capable d'\u00e9tablir la diff\u00e9rence entre un cadre formel et un cadre informel. De ce fait, sa fa\u00e7on d'agir et de parler est souvent inopportune. Elle n'est pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, ce qui a ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 ses difficult\u00e9s, et elle semble souvent d\u00e9pass\u00e9e par les menus d\u00e9tails propres \u00e0 la preuve. Cela dit, et compte tenu de son peu de connaissances des proc\u00e9dures juridiques, de sa fragilit\u00e9 psychologique, et de ses multiples interruptions, elle semble comprendre le processus et \u00eatre capable grossi\u00e8rement de mener sa d\u00e9fense et de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve. Il ne fait aucun doute que sa pr\u00e9sentation a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment tax\u00e9 la patience des avocats, et la mienne, mais c'est l\u00e0 une autre question, qui concerne davantage la question des accommodements.\n[11] Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate, j'ai commenc\u00e9 le voir-dire en vue de d\u00e9cider de la question de l'habilit\u00e9. Les intim\u00e9s ont convoqu\u00e9 le Dr Kaplan, psychologue clinicien, qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent au cours de l'audience. Le Dr Kaplan a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu en qualit\u00e9 d'expert et a exprim\u00e9 de s\u00e9rieuses r\u00e9serves relativement \u00e0 la poursuite de l'instance. Il a dit \u00eatre d'avis que la plaignante souffrait de troubles de la personnalit\u00e9 du type parano\u00efde, ce qui, de fa\u00e7on inh\u00e9rente, privait de fiabilit\u00e9 sa perception des faits. Il a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 son avis, la plaignante \u00e9tait entr\u00e9e dans un \u00e9tat de psychose durant son t\u00e9moignage. Le Dr Kaplan a aussi pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un rapport \u00e9crit, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ce dans le voir-dire. Mme Thayer s'est consid\u00e9rablement appuy\u00e9e sur le point de vue du Dr Kaplan selon lequel la plaignante \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat psychotique au moment du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Les causes portent \u00e0 croire qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un important facteur \u00e0 prendre en compte, mais ce facteur se rapporte au bien-fond\u00e9 de la cause, et la preuve est loin d'\u00eatre claire \u00e0 ce moment.\n[12] La plaignante a convoqu\u00e9 Mme Dennis en r\u00e9ponse, ainsi que deux experts, d\u00fbment reconnus \u00e0 ce titre par le Tribunal. Sa th\u00e9rapeute a aussi comparu \u00e0 l'audience, bien qu'elle n'ait pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le Dr Hunter, un m\u00e9decin ayant des connaissances expertes sur les troubles de stress post-traumatique, porte, pour l'essentiel, que le comportement de Mme Day \u00e9tait coh\u00e9rent avec un tel diagnostic. L'autre t\u00e9moin expert, le Dr Malcolm, un psychologue clinicien, a repris en grande partie la m\u00eame position. Le Dr Malcolm a trait\u00e9 la plaignante par le pass\u00e9 et cette derni\u00e8re l'a consult\u00e9 avant le d\u00e9but de l'instance. M. Houston a fait vigoureusement opposition \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le fait que le Dr Hunter et le Dr Malcolm \u00e9taient d'avis qu'il serait injuste de priver la plaignante de son droit de poursuivre. Ces avis \u00e9taient le fait de bonnes intentions et refl\u00e9taient l'opinion de ces personnes selon laquelle il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, au plan psychologique, que la plaignante poursuive la proc\u00e9dure. La question de justice rel\u00e8ve enti\u00e8rement du Tribunal, toutefois, et d\u00e9borde nettement la port\u00e9e d'application d'une preuve d'expert.\n[13] Les intim\u00e9s ont aussi contest\u00e9 la fiabilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages du Dr Hunter et du Dr Malcolm, au motif que ces derniers ne connaissaient pas bien les circonstances de la cause dont je suis saisi. Ils ont aussi soutenu, et on peut le comprendre, que le Dr Kaplan \u00e9tait mieux plac\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9senter une opinion \u00e9clair\u00e9e sur le comportement de la plaignante \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Je suis d'avis que les observations susmentionn\u00e9es ne sont pas d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de fondement ce qui pourrait avoir une incidence sur l'importance \u00e0 accorder aux t\u00e9moignages, mais ne la r\u00e9fute pas. \u00c0 mon avis, il importe, dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, de reconna\u00eetre qu'il incombe aux intim\u00e9s de me convaincre de l'incapacit\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. La plaignante n'est pas tenue de prouver des affirmations positives de fait. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu'elle a invoqu\u00e9s dans le cadre du voir-dire ne l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 que pour pallier la preuve des intim\u00e9s et les experts n'ont pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le but de d\u00e9montrer son habilit\u00e9.\n[14] Il me reste \u00e0 statuer sur un d\u00e9saccord entre les experts quant \u00e0 la nature exacte de la situation dont je suis saisi. Je ne propose pas d'entrer dans le d\u00e9tail de ce d\u00e9saccord, m\u00eame s'il existe un litige plus sp\u00e9cifique quant \u00e0 ce qui est arriv\u00e9 lorsqu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 hurler. Le Dr Kaplan a exprim\u00e9 l'avis que la plaignante \u00e9tait entr\u00e9e dans un \u00e9tat de rapide d\u00e9compensation. Cette terminologie a fait l'objet d'une certaine discussion. Les experts, par ailleurs, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 davantage enclins \u00e0 croire qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie d'un brusque rappel d'images ou d'une abr\u00e9action, qui lui a fait revivre les circonstances traumatiques en cause. On a aussi laiss\u00e9 entendre qu'elle avait v\u00e9cu un \u00e9pisode de dissociation. Je n'entends pas trancher le litige : quel que soit le point de vue retenu, il est \u00e9vident que la plaignante ne fonctionnait pas d'une mani\u00e8re rationnelle durant cet \u00e9pisode.\n[15] Je ne peux pas non plus arr\u00eater de diagnostic m\u00e9dical ou psychologique, mais il y a, \u00e0 de nombreux \u00e9gards, motif de croire qu'elle souffre de parano\u00efa en un certain sens g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Le Dr Hunter et le Dr Malcolm m'ont inform\u00e9 qu'il pourrait s'agir l\u00e0 d'une manifestation d'hyper-vigilance associ\u00e9e \u00e0 un trouble de stress post-traumatique. J'admets qu'elle est susceptible de dissocier \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins et risque de perdre contact avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Elle ne fait pas confiance aux avocats, \u00e9prouve de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser ses \u00e9motions et perd souvent le fil de ses id\u00e9es \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Un tel \u00e9tat des choses doit en partie \u00eatre imputable au fait que les all\u00e9gations dont je suis saisi pr\u00e9sentent un caract\u00e8re extr\u00eamement personnel et se r\u00e9v\u00e9leraient p\u00e9nibles quelle que soit la partie au litige. Le Dr Hunter a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Day pr\u00e9sentait une vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 sous-jacente qui rendrait une telle exp\u00e9rience encore plus \u00e9prouvante pour toute personne plac\u00e9e dans sa situation. Tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de pose un d\u00e9fi en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la conduite de l'instruction.\nIV. FONDEMENT JURIDIQUE DE LA REQU\u00caTE [16] Il ressort de la jurisprudence qu'il incombe au juge de statuer sur la question de savoir si un t\u00e9moin est apte \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Il incombe au jury de peser les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Voir : R. Harbuz [1979] 2 W.W.R. 105 et Steinberg v. The King (1931) 56 C.C.C. 9 (C.S.C.). La question doit donc \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e le plus t\u00f4t possible, pour \u00e9viter la possibilit\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. Il s'agit l\u00e0 de questions qui ne se posent pas en l'esp\u00e8ce. La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet, toutefois, que la question peut \u00eatre examin\u00e9e plus tard, si des pr\u00e9occupations pertinentes \u00e9mergent dans le cadre du t\u00e9moignage d'un t\u00e9moin.\n[17] Le droit op\u00e8re selon la pr\u00e9somption qu'un t\u00e9moin est apte \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. T\u00e9moigner n'exige pas d'aptitudes sup\u00e9rieures. La m\u00eame observation peut s'appliquer \u00e0 la question de savoir si une partie est capable de d\u00e9fendre sa cause, ce qui exige seulement la capacit\u00e9 de prendre des d\u00e9cisions personnelles de base. Les intim\u00e9s ont admis qu'ils avaient l'obligation de d\u00e9montrer, probablement selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, l'inaptitude de la plaignante \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Ils invoquent principalement l'affaire R. c. Hawke (1975) 7 O.R. (2d) 145 (C.A. Ont.), qui \u00e9claire sur cette question en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Ils ont aussi invoqu\u00e9 The Law of Evidence in Canada, de Sopinka, (2e \u00e9d.), 13.10 et s., qui donne un tr\u00e8s bref compte rendu du droit.\n[18] La Cour, dans l'arr\u00eat Hawke, reprend les termes antiques et aujourd'hui troublants de Wigmore, au paragraphe 492, et conclut qu'un t\u00e9moin ne peut \u00eatre priv\u00e9 de l'exercice du droit de t\u00e9moigner que si la d\u00e9ficience ou le trouble sont tels qu'ils affectent la fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage sur un point pr\u00e9cis. Le fait que la plaignante puisse souffrir d'un trouble psychologique ou d'un trouble de personnalit\u00e9 de type parano\u00efde, ou pourrait souffrir d'un trouble de stress post-traumatique, ne l'emp\u00eache pas de t\u00e9moigner. Je ne sais pas si la jurisprudence \u00e9nonce un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, mais la question est celle de savoir si un juge des faits peut convenablement et d'une mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre examiner la preuve, pour arriver \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision concernant les faits. L'emploi du mot fiable pr\u00eate facilement \u00e0 une fausse interpr\u00e9tation et la question n'est pas de savoir s'il faut ajouter foi \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage. La question est celle de savoir s'il est possible d'ajouter foi \u00e0 un tel t\u00e9moignage.\n[19] Je me sens tenu d'ajouter que mon premier devoir est de prot\u00e9ger l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure juridique. Bien que certains t\u00e9moins puissent parfois s'effondrer, au plan affectif, un certain degr\u00e9 de probit\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la tenue d'une audience juste. La proc\u00e9dure juridique et les r\u00e8gles de la preuve supposent une appr\u00e9ciation relativement calme et froide des faits dans une affaire donn\u00e9e, et l'objet de l'audience doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9. J'ai l'obligation fondamentale de maintenir le niveau n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9corum \u00e0 l'audience pour maintenir l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un attribut indispensable du r\u00e9gime juridique, un attribut qui garantit la justice et l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[20] Le juge des faits doit aussi pouvoir suivre et \u00e9valuer les t\u00e9moignages. Il doit \u00eatre possible de les examiner d'une mani\u00e8re intelligente. La preuve doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re qui pr\u00e9sente une certaine logique et une certaine coh\u00e9rence, et il doit \u00eatre possible de l'interpr\u00e9ter rationnellement. D'autres pr\u00e9occupations peuvent pr\u00e9valoir dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, relativement \u00e0 l'obligation qu'a un tribunal d'intervenir lorsque le d\u00e9roulement d'une instance menace le bien-\u00eatre psychologique de la partie plaignante. Cela se rapporte directement \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 qu'a la plaignante de pr\u00e9senter sa d\u00e9fense, toutefois, et il s'agit d'une pr\u00e9occupation qui vient au deuxi\u00e8me plan.\nV. L'APTITUDE \u00c0 T\u00c9MOIGNER DE LA PLAIGNANTE [21] Les parties ont fait un grand effort pour s'acquitter du fardeau qui leur incombait d'\u00e9tablir l'inaptitude de la plaignante \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. J'ai beaucoup de r\u00e9serves en ce qui concerne la poursuite de l'instance, ainsi que des doutes sur la capacit\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 participer \u00e0 l'audience d'une mani\u00e8re sens\u00e9e et \u00e9clair\u00e9e. Je suis particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 en ce qui concerne sa capacit\u00e9 de composer avec les \u00e9l\u00e9ments rigoureux d'un contre-interrogatoire, auquel il faudra faire face. J'ai accord\u00e9 une latitude consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 la plaignante dans la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve principale, mais les intim\u00e9s ont droit de la confronter aux d\u00e9tails de l'affaire en contre-interrogatoire et je ne vois pas comment lui \u00e9viter un tel exercice.\n[22] Mme Thayer a soutenu que Mme Day a fait preuve d'un manque de compr\u00e9hension de l'instance et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des expos\u00e9s de fait inexacts depuis le d\u00e9but de l'audience. Elle a donn\u00e9 des exemples clairs, \u00e0 son avis, de pens\u00e9e d\u00e9lirante. Il ne fait aucun doute que la capacit\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 se souvenir pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment des faits et \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question. Mme Thayer a soutenu que deux grandes questions ont, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, enclench\u00e9 un comportement inad\u00e9quat et des ruptures avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. La premi\u00e8re concerne le harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la plaignante. La deuxi\u00e8me concerne son bien-\u00eatre mental. Les intim\u00e9s admettent que Mme Day peut pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve exacts et m\u00eame probants. Mais cette capacit\u00e9 se d\u00e9grade rapidement lorsqu'elle doit traiter de faits qui sont au c\u0153ur de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Il s'ensuit que sa preuve perd sa fiabilit\u00e9 lorsqu'elle traite des all\u00e9gations de faits essentielles.\n[23] Je partage les pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es par les avocats. Il est manifeste que l'effondrement pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clench\u00e9 par le r\u00e9cit des d\u00e9tails de ses all\u00e9gations. Malgr\u00e9 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre fin au t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 ce moment. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu'elle ne pouvait pas pr\u00e9senter un r\u00e9cit utile des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont men\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t des plaintes. Une des caract\u00e9ristiques de l'esp\u00e8ce est que ce sont les exigences de la proc\u00e9dure qui ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 les conditions qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effondrement de la plaignante. La situation n'est pas statique et la v\u00e9ritable pr\u00e9occupation se rapporte au fait que la proc\u00e9dure de t\u00e9moignage pourrait pr\u00e9cipiter un effondrement plus grave et plus prolong\u00e9. Je me rends compte que la situation met la plaignante en p\u00e9ril et que les avocats n'entrevoient pas avec joie la possibilit\u00e9 qu'elle puisse conna\u00eetre un \u00e9pisode encore plus grave \u00e0 cause de la tension que susciterait leur interrogatoire. Cette question rel\u00e8ve toutefois de la conjecture et je ne suis pas convaincu d'avoir atteint le seuil o\u00f9 je pourrais conclure qu'elle est incapable de t\u00e9moigner.\n[24] La question de capacit\u00e9 n'est soulev\u00e9e que lorsqu'il y a d\u00e9ficience fondamentale des capacit\u00e9s cognitives du t\u00e9moin. Le t\u00e9moignage psychiatrique dans Hawke, par exemple, \u00e9tablissait que la t\u00e9moin en cause hallucinait \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Elle \u00e9tait aussi accompagn\u00e9e, dans son esprit, par une petite fille nomm\u00e9e Delores. Sa compagne \u00e9tait, aux dires de la t\u00e9moin, \u00e0 la p. 160, supra, [TRADUCTION] dans ma t\u00eate me disant des choses qui allaient me faire emprisonner et lib\u00e9rer Tommy. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve mis \u00e0 ma disposition indiquent que la plaignante dans la pr\u00e9sente cause a au moins manifest\u00e9 des \u00e9pisodes de dissociation \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins et qu'elle est peut-\u00eatre parfois en contact avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et parfois non. Certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrent qu'elle a connu des \u00e9pisodes de psychose par le pass\u00e9. Les seuils atteints dans la situation devant moi n'atteignent cependant en rien de telles proportions.\n[25] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, les intim\u00e9s ont aussi soutenu que l'\u00e9tat psychologique de la plaignante au moment o\u00f9 elle aurait cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e la rendait inapte \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve satisfaisant la norme n\u00e9cessaire aux r\u00e8gles de la preuve. Cette observation est toutefois pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e et s'appuie sur divers facteurs, comme le diagnostic de son \u00e9tat. M\u00eame si le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante comporte beaucoup d'imperfections, les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9tabli le fondement probatoire qui ferait valoir une telle conclusion. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Dr Kaplan a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par les autres t\u00e9moins du volet psychologique et peut, \u00e0 tout le moins, faire l'objet d'un d\u00e9bat. Il peut exister des motifs de pr\u00e9occupation sur cet aspect du t\u00e9moignage, mais la pr\u00e9occupation la plus imm\u00e9diate se rapporte \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat actuel de la plaignante.\n[26] Il est devenu manifeste durant le voir-dire que les experts ont une opinion diff\u00e9rente du bien-fond\u00e9 de la cause. Les experts qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en faveur de Mme Day semblent croire qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e sexuellement et que c'est le harc\u00e8lement sexuel qui a donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 l'\u00e9pisode traumatique associ\u00e9 au trouble de stress post-traumatique diagnostiqu\u00e9 par ses experts. La partie adverse adopte cependant une position tout autant rigide : elle avance que Mme Day a souffert d'un trouble de personnalit\u00e9 parano\u00efaque et a uniquement cru qu'elle faisait l'objet de harc\u00e8lement. Ses perceptions n'auraient eu aucun rapport avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00e0 leur avis, et auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 le produit d'un trouble psychologique. Si ce dernier point de vue est retenu, et le crit\u00e8re des cours appliqu\u00e9, la preuve qu'elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re inh\u00e9rent tellement peu fiable qu'il serait dangereux de la pr\u00e9senter devant un jury. La difficult\u00e9 r\u00e9side dans le fait qu'un tel \u00e9tat des choses m'appelle \u00e0 statuer sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la cause, en d\u00e9cidant des questions d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant moi dans le voir-dire.\n[27] M\u00eame si je ne crois pas que nous en sommes d\u00e9j\u00e0 au point o\u00f9 je pourrais intervenir, je suis d'avis que la situation actuelle doit \u00eatre suivie. Si le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante continue de se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer, ou s'il devient impossible de tenir une audience comme telle, il faudra peut-\u00eatre revenir \u00e0 la question de la capacit\u00e9.\nVI. L'APTITUDE DE LA PLAIGNANTE \u00c0 PR\u00c9SENTER SA CAUSE [28] Je n'ai pas pu passer les textes juridiques en revue eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la question de savoir si la plaignante est capable de se repr\u00e9senter elle-m\u00eame. Le crit\u00e8re pourrait \u00eatre celui de savoir si elle est capable de donner des instructions \u00e0 un avocat. Cette question n'est cependant pas pr\u00e9sentement d\u00e9terminante et je veux simplement traiter des pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par les intim\u00e9s relativement au bien-\u00eatre de la plaignante. Les experts qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans le cadre du voir-dire ne sont pas d'accord sur l'effet \u00e0 long terme de la participation de Mme Day \u00e0 l'audience. Le Dr Hunter et le Dr Malcolm ont dit croire qu'il \u00e9tait essentiel, au plan psychologique, que Mme Day ait la possibilit\u00e9 de mener cette affaire jusqu'\u00e0 sa conclusion logique. Cela pourrait \u00eatre accessoire quant \u00e0 l'objet d'une audience. N\u00e9anmoins, je crois que Mme Day a le droit fondamental de pr\u00e9senter sa cause et que l'effet th\u00e9rapeutique d'une telle pr\u00e9sentation est un facteur valide, dans l'examen des droits d'une plaignante.\n[29] Je ne suis pas autant convaincu que le Dr Hunter et le Dr Malcolm le sont des avantages qui d\u00e9couleraient de la participation de la plaignante \u00e0 l'audience, et je partage certaines des pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es par le Dr Kaplan. Je ne crois cependant pas qu'il serait indiqu\u00e9 d'intervenir dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la plaignante sauf si nous atteignons le point o\u00f9 elle deviendrait inhabile au sens large de ce terme et ne pouvait d\u00e9cider pour elle-m\u00eame. Jusque l\u00e0, la plaignante est la seule qui peut d\u00e9cider de ce qui sert le mieux ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Elle peut faire des choix qui vont manifestement contre ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Mais cela est vrai de tout citoyen et ce serait tout \u00e0 fait une erreur, \u00e0 mon avis, de la traiter comme une personne d\u00e9pendante. Il s'agit l\u00e0 directement de la question juridique de dignit\u00e9, qui exige que les tribunaux et les cours autorisent les parties \u00e0 un litige \u00e0 prendre leurs propres d\u00e9cisions, et m\u00eame les plus d\u00e9concertantes.\n[30] Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une question de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Quand j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Day si elle \u00e9tait capable de poursuivre, elle a r\u00e9pondu sans \u00e9quivoque. Elle croit qu'elle peut continuer et m'a inform\u00e9 qu'elle sait comment demander de l'aide. Pour autant que je puisse le d\u00e9terminer, elle comprend ses obligations en tant que t\u00e9moin, est capable de communiquer ses pens\u00e9es et, d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, maintient son rapport avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Elle reconna\u00eet aussi le besoin d'\u00e9valuer si ses perceptions sont exactes et bien fond\u00e9es. Elle convient, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 mes questions, qu'elle ne devrait pas jurer dans la salle d'audience et qu'elle est tenue de respecter les autres participants \u00e0 l'audience. La question de savoir si elle pourra se conformer \u00e0 une telle exigence est une autre question.\n[31] La plaignante est une partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure et conclure \u00e0 son incapacit\u00e9 la privera probablement de son droit de saisir le Tribunal de la plainte. Pour le moment, \u00e0 tout le moins, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 la priver de cette possibilit\u00e9. Le droit international sur les droits de la personne est fond\u00e9 sur la dignit\u00e9 de la personne, qui oblige un tribunal \u00e0 respecter l'autonomie personnelle des parties qui se pr\u00e9sentent devant lui. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un aspect fondamental de l'\u00eatre en tant que personne, un aspect qui garantit nos libert\u00e9s. Poursuivre pr\u00e9sente des dangers et, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, il pourra devenir n\u00e9cessaire d'intervenir. Cependant, pr\u00e9sentement, c'est \u00e0 la plaignante qu'il revient ultimement de d\u00e9cider si elle veut poursuivre. Nous n'avons pas encore atteint le point o\u00f9 je pourrais faire obstacle \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision.\nVII. D\u00c9CISION [32] Je suis par cons\u00e9quent d'avis que la plaignante est capable de t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 ce moment et qu'elle peut se repr\u00e9senter elle-m\u00eame. N\u00e9anmoins, j'entretiens de r\u00e9elles pr\u00e9occupations eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la question de savoir si elle pourra mener sa cause \u00e0 terme. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances, je crois qu'il est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 de statuer sur la requ\u00eate. Il me semble mieux indiqu\u00e9 de mettre fin au voir-dire et de reprendre l'audience, sous r\u00e9serve qu'il soit clairement entendu que la question pourra \u00eatre ouverte de nouveau sur requ\u00eate des parties.\n[33] Mon interpr\u00e9tation du droit, dans son \u00e9tat actuel, porte \u00e0 conclure que la preuve aff\u00e9rente au voir-dire pourrait \u00eatre pertinente aux questions comme celle de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et devrait s'appliquer \u00e0 l'ensemble de l'audience. Cependant, j'invite les observations des parties \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Par ailleurs, il faudra aussi examiner la question des accommodements possibles.\nOriginale sign\u00e9e par\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 12 mars 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS DU TRIBUNAL Nos : T627\/1501 et T628\/1601\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Amanda Day c.

Je peux peut-\u00eatre vous aider un peu.\nAvez-vous trouv\u00e9 cette exp\u00e9rience effrayante?\nR : Non, je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 cela effrayant du tout. C'\u00e9tait -- une exp\u00e9rience tr\u00e8s plaisante et calme. C'est simplement que la personne -- c'est la nature des questions qui entourent le -- c'est la nature des questions qui \u00e9taient discut\u00e9es au sujet de ce genre d'hypnose avec l'autre personne qui m'inqui\u00e8te un peu.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : J'aimerais en savoir davantage \u00e0 ce sujet. Vous n'avez pas besoin d'aller beaucoup dans le d\u00e9tail, mais donnez-moi simplement une id\u00e9e de ce qu'\u00e9tait la nature de ces questions discut\u00e9es.\n(BR\u00c8VE PAUSE)\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : \u00c7a se rapporte aux Hell's Angels.

Et vous avez expliqu\u00e9 que cela s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans le contexte de certaines craintes que vous aviez au sujet des Hell's Angels et possiblement --\nR : Je n'ai pas peur des Hell's Angels. Je n'a pas peur des Hell's Angels.\nQ : Vous n'avez pas peur des Hell's Angels, mais les pr\u00e9occupations qui \u00e9taient soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque se rapportaient aux Hell's Angels, n'est-ce pas? Est-ce exact?\nR : Je suis une Hell's Angel.\nQ : Vous \u00eates une Hell's Angel? Maintenant?\nR : Oui.\nQ : Vous \u00eates un membre des Hell's Angels?\nR : Oui.\nQ : Depuis combien de temps \u00eates-vous membre des Hell's Angels?\nR : Depuis longtemps.\nQ : \u00c9tiez-vous membre des Hell's Angels lorsque vous \u00e9tiez avec M.

Que voulez-vous dire en disant cela, madame Day?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : La premi\u00e8re fois qu'on m'a dit que j'\u00e9tais une Hell's Angel, j'avais environ quinze (15) ans. Et la m\u00e8re de ma meilleure amie a dit \u00e0 ma meilleure amie de me dire que j'allais \u00eatre une Hell's Angel.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Qu'est-ce qu'un Hell's Angel?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Bien, je n'en ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait certaine, moi-m\u00eame, mais je crois qu'une Hell's Angel est quelqu'un qui est l\u00e0 pour aider quelqu'un d'autre lorsque cette personne se fait violer.\nDes pages 2963 \u00e0 2970 :\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Madame Thayer, cela ne soul\u00e8ve \u00e0 mes yeux aucun probl\u00e8me si vous pr\u00e9cisez beaucoup plus sp\u00e9cifiquement pourquoi elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 hypnotis\u00e9e.\nMme JOYCE THAYER : C'est ce que j'allais faire ensuite.\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Bien, si vous avez simplement une conversation pour vous mettre d'accord si les tueurs et quelques pauvres prostitu\u00e9es qui --\nR : Il n'a pas --\nQ : -- qui --\nR : -- vraiment --\nQ : -- si je peux vous demander, madame Day, si vous discutez de cela et comment vous pouvez aider quelqu'un qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 -- ou \u00e9tait possiblement en danger d'une telle mani\u00e8re, comment l'hypnose vous a-t-elle aid\u00e9e \u00e0 faire cela en particulier?\nR : Bien, ce qu'il a fait c'est qu'il m'a parl\u00e9 tr\u00e8s lentement et calmement et il m'a parl\u00e9 par petits bouts. Il ne m'a pas racont\u00e9 une histoire sur ce qui se passait, il me l'a simplement transmise -\nQ : Hum hum.\nR : -- des petits bouts de renseignements que j'ai pu plus tard assimiler et reconstruire moi-m\u00eame et il m'a simplement demand\u00e9 si -- si je savais que cette personne avait vraiment, vraiment besoin d'aide est-ce que j'accepterais de l'aider et j'ai dit oui et je -- nous voulions sortir et l'aider ce jour-l\u00e0 mais on m'a dit d'oublier et donc j'ai simplement oubli\u00e9 et il s'est pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps avant que tous les bouts ne reviennent \u00e0 mon souvenir.\nQ : Donc, ce que vous me dites c'est que la mani\u00e8re dont il a communiqu\u00e9 avec vous \u00e9tait hypnotique? Est-ce ce que vous dites et vous ne vous en \u00eates pas rappel\u00e9 avant un certain temps plus tard?\nR : Oui. Bien, on m'a dit d'oublier et c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9cevant au moment o\u00f9 on me l'a dit, et j'ai effectivement oubli\u00e9.\nQ : Donc, lorsque vous dites qu'on vous a dit d'oublier, c'est ce qui vous a fait croire que vous aviez \u00e9t\u00e9 hypnotis\u00e9e? Est-ce exact?\nR : Non. Peter m'a dit que Robin \u00e9tait comme Ravine et que c'\u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle -- c'est pour cela que j'ai un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d'information qui dit que mes conversations avec Robin - le gros Robin avaient un caract\u00e8re hypnotique.\nEt, en fait, maintenant que je me rends compte des choses \u00e0 travers lesquelles je suis pass\u00e9e au cours des dix (10) ann\u00e9es, c'est que j'ai r\u00e9agi et je me suis rappel\u00e9 les directives du gros Robin -- lorsque j'ai re\u00e7u le bon stimulus, je me rappelle certaines choses et je sais quoi dire ou je sais quoi faire, mais pas n\u00e9cessairement -- quand cela arrive \u00e0 ce moment, je n'ai aucune id\u00e9e pourquoi je fais ce que je fais ou pourquoi je dis ce que je dis.\nMais ensuite, plus tard, lorsque je suis capable de me souvenir mieux et de retourner \u00e0 ce moment dans le temps, alors je me rends compte que j'ai dit ce que j'ai dit en r\u00e9action \u00e0 un certain stimulus parce que -- ou j'ai fait ce que j'ai fait en r\u00e9action \u00e0 certains stimuli, parce que j'avais re\u00e7u ces directives.\nEt j'ai agi \u00e0 un -- \u00e0 partir d'un niveau subconscient et cela me fait comprendre que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 hypnotis\u00e9e.\nQ : Donc lorsque vous dites que vous aviez ces directives, vous croyez que des choses que vous faites aujourd'hui sont le r\u00e9sultat de suggestions hypnotiques qui vous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites pendant que vous \u00e9tiez sous hypnose. Est-ce exact?\nR : Oui, c'est exact.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Vous pouvez aller plus loin.\nMme JOYCE THAYER : Oui.\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Et j'aimerais dire que je suis tr\u00e8s susceptible \u00e0 l'hypnose. Je dirais que cela est certain, si -- si quelqu'un cherchait un sujet \u00e0 hypnotiser, je serais le sujet parfait parce que pour cela -- je -- je suis un bon sujet d'hypnose.\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Pouvez-vous me donner des exemples de comportement que vous reconnaissez r\u00e9cemment, ou depuis peu de temps, comme \u00e9tant le r\u00e9sultat d'une suggestion hypnotique? Pouvez-vous nous donner un exemple de quelque chose comme cela?\nR : Oui, je peux.\nQ : Veuillez nous en donner un.\nR : Bien, je sais qu'une (1) chose tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange a \u00e9t\u00e9, durant l'enqu\u00eate interne de l'employeur, l'enqu\u00eateur m'a interrog\u00e9e au sujet de la pornographie dont je me plaignais \u00e0 bord du protecteur.\nEt elle a dit, bien, qu'avez-vous vu? Et j'ai d\u00e9crit -- bien, premi\u00e8rement, j'ai d\u00e9crit ce que j'ai vu quand j'ai vu l'image et la fa\u00e7on dont je me suis alors sentie \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange.\nEt elle a dit, bien, qu'avez-vous vu, ou quelque chose comme cela. Et je -- et les mots sont sortis de ma bouche, sans que je sache pourquoi je les disais, et j'ai m\u00eame effray\u00e9 -- je me suis m\u00eame effray\u00e9e moi-m\u00eame parce que je ne comprenais pas pourquoi j'avais dit ce que j'avais dit. Et je pensais que les gens allaient penser que j'\u00e9tais folle \u00e0 cause de ce que j'avais dit.\nQ : Qu'avez-vous dit?\nR : J'ai dit, je vois Helter Skelter [ci-apr\u00e8s P\u00eale-M\u00eale]\nQ : Et vous, apr\u00e8s, avez compris que c'\u00e9tait quelque chose que Robin avait plac\u00e9 dans votre esprit pendant que vous \u00e9tiez sous hypnose?\nR : Bien, Robin m'a donn\u00e9 des directives et il a dit que si -- il a dit que j'allais voir l'image. Et il a dit que je -- je saurais -- j'allais trouver laquelle c'\u00e9tait. Il a dit que je le saurais quand je la verrais. Et que quand je la verrais, j'allais dire, je vois P\u00eale-M\u00eale.\nD'abord, il a parl\u00e9 au sujet des films et il a dit, quel est le film le plus \u00e9peurant que tu as vu? J'ai dit, bien, je -- je ne peux voir les films effrayants, je -- j'ai vu l'Exorciste, mais \u00e0 par \u00e7a, je n'ai pas vu de film d'\u00e9pouvante, parce que je -- je ne les aime pas.\nEt il --\nQ : Je vous \u00e9coute \u00e0 ce sujet.\nR : -- dit, bien, quel est le film le plus effrayant dont tu as jamais entendu parler? Et j'ai dit, P\u00eale-M\u00eale. Et alors il a dit, bien, je vois P\u00eale-M\u00eale. Et cela n'\u00e9tait pas clair pour nous. Et je ne pouvais comprendre -- j'\u00e9tais comme, bien, oui.\nQ : Et qu'en est-il des autres choses, madame Day?\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Quand Robin vous a-t-il dit cela, madame Day?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Nous \u00e9tions dans sa biblioth\u00e8que.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Je veux dire quelle \u00e9tait la date. Il y a combien de temps?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Bien, je ne peux pas me rappeler si c'\u00e9tait -- je pense que c'\u00e9tait juste apr\u00e8s que je sois revenue de Tha\u00eflande, donc c'\u00e9tait en 1987, donc, et c'\u00e9tait longtemps avant -- c'\u00e9tait exactement \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 j'ai rencontr\u00e9 Peter, et c'\u00e9tait quelques ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s que nous ayons eu Robin, donc ce doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9, je pense, en 1987.\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Y a-t-il d'autres choses auxquelles vous pouvez penser, \u00e0 part votre r\u00e9action \u00e0 l'image, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat du conditionnement hypnotique re\u00e7u de Robin?\nR : Autres choses auxquelles je peux penser comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 du conditionnement?\nQ : Bien, votre r\u00e9ponse selon laquelle plus tard vous pouviez rattacher certains faits \u00e0 une suggestion hypnotique?\nR : Oui, il y a quelque chose d'autre que je suis cens\u00e9e faire, il y a quelque chose -- il y a...\n(BR\u00c8VE PAUSE)\nR : Oui, il y a probablement quelque chose d'autre, mais sans tout repasser du d\u00e9but jusqu'\u00e0 la fin, et passer dans le d\u00e9tail avec -- peut-\u00eatre avec mon th\u00e9rapeute ou quelque chose que je, probablement\u2026\nQ : Mais, il y a d'autres choses que vous pouvez --\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Bien, dans quel contexte, madame Day?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Dans quel contexte?\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Bien, y a-t-il eu des choses qui sont arriv\u00e9es pendant le harc\u00e8lement sexuel, ou la pornographie comme vous venez juste d'en d\u00e9crire? Y a-t-il eu d'autres incidents comme cela? Des moments o\u00f9 vous vous \u00eates rendue compte que vous \u00e9tiez en train de dire quelque chose, ou de faire quelque chose? Parce que vous pensiez que Robin vous avait dit de le faire?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Oh oui. Oui, il y a eu une autre chose, oui, qui est arriv\u00e9e. Oh oui. Oui, Robin a dit -- d'accord, non -- oui, je veux l'avoir -- j'allais avoir un message, bien, j'ai eu un message et \u00e7a avait compl\u00e8tement rapport avec la - cette -- mon interpr\u00e9tation de l'information qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e durant cette r\u00e9union, \u00e9tait que je recevrais un message, et que lorsque j'aurais le message, j'\u00e9tais cens\u00e9e entrer dans une institution psychiatrique et parler aux m\u00e9decins et aux infirmi\u00e8res de la situation.\nEt, il a dit que certainement ils allaient penser que j'\u00e9tais vraiment folle, et il a dit peu importe ce que j'avais d'y aller et de le faire -- ou pourrais-je y aller et le faire, et j'ai dit oui, certainement, je vais y aller.\nEt donc, il est devenu tr\u00e8s clair qu'\u00e0 un (1) certain moment, quand j'avais l'\u00e9pisode psychotique, je devais me rendre \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, et que j'\u00e9tais mourante, et je n'ai pas compris de quoi il s'agissait -- totalement de quoi, mais je suppose que cela aussi se rapportait au fait que j'avais le SIDA, qui est quelque chose qui remonte au moment o\u00f9 j'\u00e9tais une Hell's Angel \u00e0 -- \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole secondaire.\nDonc, il y a cela, puis ces choses qui sont arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole secondaire, j'avais le SIDA, et puis il y a eu -- j'\u00e9tais en train de mourir, et c'\u00e9tait le Dr Brox, et puis il y a eu le fait que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e d'aller \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, et de leur dire o\u00f9 le -- leur dire \u00e0 ce sujet.\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Amanda, puis-je vous interroger au sujet du SIDA? Avez-vous le SIDA?\nR : Bien, ce que je suis suppos\u00e9e de dire est que mon ami se tient l\u00e0, et il dit, mon autre ami se tenant ici, et un autre ami ici, et nous sommes au ruisseau Balka (phon\u00e9tique), au pont, et par -- derri\u00e8re l'\u00e9cole secondaire, nous allions l\u00e0 et -- les gens se tiennent l\u00e0, et puis je -- la m\u00e8re de Matt dit que je suis une Hell's Angel, et Matt dit que je suis -- ce que je veux que tu fasses, c'est que quand tu auras tout compris cela, je veux que tu dises, j'ai le SIDA.\nEt le nom de notre autre est Adrian (phon\u00e9tique) et donc je suis cens\u00e9e dire que j'ai le SIDA et puis il dit, bien, Adrian, qu'est-ce que tu dis quand elle dit cela et puis Adrian dit, il veut dire que c'est une chanson de Eric Clapton, Coca\u00efne.\nEt je dis, bravo, donc tu peux me fournir un alibi, et c'est comme une farce. Et puis -- et alors nous disons, bien, alors qu'allons-nous faire? Et il dit, bien, je vais aller voir mon ami Kevin qui se tient l\u00e0-bas.\nEt Kevin -- et alors -- et alors il dit, Kevin Duik (phon\u00e9tique) est fameux. Et puis Matt dit, va -- d'accord, va -- maintenant, va et parle \u00e0 Berto (phon\u00e9tique) sur le pont.\nDonc je me rends l\u00e0 et je parle \u00e0 Berto sur le pont. Et le probl\u00e8me est que, son amie de fille est en train de se faire violer et qu'on est en train d'en faire une prostitu\u00e9e et cela a rapport avec l'\u00e9cole. Et cela -- aussi c'est quelque chose qui a rapport avec la classe de th\u00e9\u00e2tre parce que le professeur de th\u00e9\u00e2tre me dit de me comporter comme si j'\u00e9tais une prostitu\u00e9e.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : J'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 vous suivre, madame Day. De quoi \u00eates-vous en train de parler?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Ces gens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assassin\u00e9s plus tard et nous n'avons pas compris pourquoi ce type nomm\u00e9 Jay Kirk (phon\u00e9tique) avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assassin\u00e9.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Prenons quinze (15) minutes.\nL'AGENT DU GREFFE : \u00c0 l'ordre, s'il vous pla\u00eet.\nDes pages 2980 \u00e0 2983 :\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Lorsqu'il vous sugg\u00e9rait quelque chose quand vous \u00e9tiez hypnotis\u00e9e, est-ce qu'il vous sugg\u00e9rait que vous deviez faire quelque chose plus tard?\nR : Bien, vous voyez, j'ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Peter de notre journ\u00e9e, sur le pont, et que nous devions y retourner, et nous savions au sujet de Jay Kirk, et Tanya Van Tollenburg, mais - et ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assassin\u00e9s, et Peter - et j'ai dit \u00e0 Peter ce que je savais au sujet de Jay Kirk, et de Tanya Van Tollenburg, parce que j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 - ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 dans notre \u00e9cole, et donc, Robin savait que ma - nous avions des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de maladie mentale dans ma famille, et que j'avais eu - nous avions discut\u00e9, vous savez, d'o\u00f9 nous pourrions nous retrouver plus tard dans la vie, et de notre cynisme \u00e0 ce sujet.\nEt Robin m'a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9, ce jour-l\u00e0, quand je dis qu'il s'agissait d'une exp\u00e9rience sous hypnose, ou au moins, c'est l'effet que cela a eu globalement sur moi, c'est qu'il m'a dit que ce qu'il voulait que je fasse c'\u00e9tait d'entrer dans une institution pour malades mentaux et de commencer \u00e0 tout dire \u00e0 ce sujet aux m\u00e9decins et aux infirmi\u00e8res.\nEt il voulait, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, que je leur dise --\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Bien, et est-ce que vous avez donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cette suggestion plus tard?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Oui, je l'ai certainement fait, mais je --\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Quand?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : -- Je veux dire, je ne savais pas que c'\u00e9tait tout -- ce que signifiait tout cela.

C'\u00e9tait des choses vraies que les gens m'avaient dit de dire quand j'\u00e9tais \u00e0 -- lorsque j'accomplissais m\u00e9thodiquement toutes les directives qu'on m'avait donn\u00e9es, j'avais l'air compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9traqu\u00e9e. Mais, en m\u00eame temps, j'avais - je -- je pense que j'avais de la difficult\u00e9, \u00e0 ce moment, parce que ma sant\u00e9 s'est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e.\nJe n'avais pas dormi depuis environ -- comme, trois (3) ou quatre (4) semaines --\nDes pages 2989 \u00e0 2991 :\nEt donc j'\u00e9tais tr\u00e8s calme et tranquille. Et lorsque le Dr Schuldrop et l'infirmi\u00e8re \u00e9taient assis l\u00e0 et qu'ils ont dit -- ils m'ont dit quelque chose au sujet du Dr Runtz. Il a dit, est-ce que le Dr Runtz est votre psychologue? Et j'ai r\u00e9pondu, oui.\nEt puis, soudainement, sans m\u00eame que je le sache, tout a sembl\u00e9 sortir de ma bouche, comme si ce n'\u00e9tait m\u00eame pas moi qui parlait, mais j'ai dit, oui, oink, oink, tu comprends?\nComme, pas tout \u00e0 fait dans ce ton de voix, j'ai dit, oink, oink, tu comprends?\nEt j'\u00e9tais tout simplement, oh mon Dieu, j'ai tout simplement dit quelque chose comme -- et j'esp\u00e9rais qu'ils -- peut-\u00eatre qu'ils n'avaient pas remarqu\u00e9 que j'avais dit cela. Et je m'\u00e9nervais int\u00e9rieurement parce que je pensais, ils vont penser que je suis folle et ils vont me garder ici pour toujours.\nEt j'ignorais d'o\u00f9 diable cela pouvait \u00eatre venu et j'essayais simplement de demeurer calme et j'esp\u00e9rais qu'ils n'avaient pas remarqu\u00e9. Et puis, l'infirmi\u00e8re a dit quelque chose comme, je pense qu'il y avait quelques mots l\u00e0, d'o\u00f9 sont-ils venus?\nEt puis, la conversation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9vi\u00e9e par quelque chose. Mais plus tard je me suis rendue compte que j'\u00e9tais suppos\u00e9e dire oink, oink, tu comprends, une fois arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital. Mais ils m'avaient drogu\u00e9e tellement de fois que l'information que j'\u00e9tais suppos\u00e9e leur dire, ils continuaient \u00e0 m'emplir compl\u00e8tement de drogues et \u00e0 m'assommer que je ne pouvais pas leur dire ce que j'\u00e9tais cens\u00e9e leur dire pour entrer l\u00e0 et -- mais alors, je ne savais m\u00eame pas, comme, de quoi il s'agissait et pourquoi diable j'\u00e9tais cens\u00e9e leur dire cela.\nQ : Qui vous a dit de leur dire cela?\nR : Robin et Peter et -- et c'\u00e9tait -- et c'\u00e9tait -- ils ont dit que c'\u00e9tait vraiment, vraiment, vraiment important et je riais tout le temps et je disais oh mon Dieu, comme, vas-t'en donc, c'est tellement stupide et Peter s'est r\u00e9ellement f\u00e2ch\u00e9.\nIl a dit non, c'est vraiment important et Robin \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en train de devenir en col\u00e8re dans la cuisine et il criait dans la cuisine s'adressant \u00e0 Peter qui \u00e9tait dans une autre pi\u00e8ce et j'\u00e9tais dans une autre pi\u00e8ce.\nNous \u00e9tions tous dans des pi\u00e8ces diff\u00e9rentes de la maison et c'est pourquoi tout cela \u00e9tait tellement bizarre et Robin criait dans la cuisine disant que cela \u00e9tait vraiment important et Peter allait y aller, n'est-ce pas? D'accord, d'accord, d'accord. Je le ferai encore.\nDonc, alors, il l'a fait encore. Il fait Oink, oink. Tu comprends? et il a fait cela comme quatre (4) ou cinq (5) fois et finalement j'ai simplement dit d'accord, d'accord, d'accord, d'accord, je comprends.\nEt donc -- et alors j'ai simplement oubli\u00e9 tout cela mais alors quand j'ai fini par \u00eatre \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital j'\u00e9tais assise sur le divan et alors les mots me sont sortis de la bouche Oink, oink. Tu comprends. Et c'\u00e9tait juste comme, d'o\u00f9 diable cela m'\u00e9tait-il venu? Comme, et je ne savais pas, comme, pour -- je ne me suis pas rendue compte, honn\u00eatement, avant quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard que cela \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 ma rencontre avec Robin et Peter et moi \u00e0 ce moment.\nDonc c'\u00e9tait -- c'\u00e9tait juste comme si mon cerveau avait \u00e9ject\u00e9 de la mati\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait l\u00e0 et je ne pouvais pas ma\u00eetriser ce qui se passait. Ces mots ont tout simplement sorti. Tout cela est bien r\u00e9el et cela est li\u00e9 \u00e0 quelque chose qui s'est pass\u00e9 mais je ne sais pas toujours pourquoi cela est sorti \u00e0 ce moment.\nDes pages 2996 \u00e0 3000 :\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : La m\u00eame chose est-elle arriv\u00e9e avec M. Hortie?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Oui. Oh oui. Il me donnait tout \u00e0 fait des directives sur ce qu'il voulait que je fasse, et il employait la suggestion pour manipuler ma conduite.

Les choses que vous avez transform\u00e9es en acte, \u00e0 cause des suggestions que vous aviez re\u00e7ues de M. Hortie?\nR : Oui. C'est difficile, parce qu'il me faut, d'une certaine fa\u00e7on, les chercher dans ma t\u00eate un certain temps.\nQ : Bien, je vais vous donner une minute, et pensez-y tout simplement.\nR : Je sais qu'\u00e0 un (1) certain moment donn\u00e9, il m'a dit qu'il savait que je faisais l'objet de harc\u00e8lement au chantier naval et il a dit -- qu'il savait que j'allais vraiment \u00eatre bien triste au sujet de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 et il a dit que j'allais conna\u00eetre beaucoup de chagrin. Et il a dit que j'allais probablement jouer et chanter une chanson qui \u00e9tait -- c'est une chanson des Beatles -- je ne peux me rappeler des mots.\nMon petit chou, c'est correct, simplement -- le soleil viendra ou quelque chose.\nQ : Et dans quel contexte alliez-vous chanter cette chanson?\nR : Il a dit que le contexte serait que j'aurais tellement de chagrin \u00e0 cause du harc\u00e8lement que t\u00f4t ou tard je me retrouverais \u00e0 jouer cette chanson et \u00e0 pleurer sur mon sort.\nQ : Est-ce que cela est arriv\u00e9?\nR : Cela est arriv\u00e9. Je peux gratter cette m\u00e9lodie sur les cordes d'une guitare parfaitement et je ne joue presque jamais de guitare.\nQ : Donc, c'\u00e9tait un message que M. Hortie avait implant\u00e9 dans votre esprit que vous avez transform\u00e9 en acte plus tard?\nR : Oui. Mais je -- ce qui est curieux dans tout cela c'est que je ne m'\u00e9tais pas vraiment rendue compte pourquoi je faisais cela et pourquoi j'avais accompli cela avant qu'il ne se passe quelques ann\u00e9es -- que je faisais -- que je jouais cette chanson exactement et que j'\u00e9tais capable de produire cette m\u00e9lodie en grattant la guitare et jouer cette chanson parce que je ne sais pas gratter \u00e0 la guitare ni jouer aucune autre chanson si ce n'est les chansons que le professeur de guitare m'a enseign\u00e9es quand j'\u00e9tais une adolescente.\nQ : Selon ce que vous pouvez vous rappeler, quels autres types de choses M. Hortie a-t-il implant\u00e9es dans votre esprit, des choses qui vous ont pouss\u00e9e \u00e0 accomplir certains actes par la suite?\nR : Il a dit qu'il allait probablement y avoir des circonstances o\u00f9 nous ne nous verrions pas pendant longtemps ou que nous n'allions pas \u00eatre capables de communiquer l'un avec l'autre.\nDonc, ce qu'il voulait que je fasse, c'\u00e9tait de dire le mot confiance, et c'est ce que cela allait \u00eatre -- cela allait \u00eatre -- quand dans des situations o\u00f9 nous ne serions pas capables de nous parler que j'allais dire le mot confiance.\nQ : Est-ce que cela est arriv\u00e9?\nR : Bien, oui, cela est arriv\u00e9.\nQ : Pouvez-vous expliquer?\nR : Je participais \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec le Tribunal et j'entendais la voix de M. Hortie dans la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pour la premi\u00e8re fois. Je n'avais rien dit -- je n'avais pas entendu M. Hortie au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ni en personne depuis pas mal d'ann\u00e9es.\nEt, tout soudainement, j'ai r\u00e9gurgit\u00e9 le mot confiance, et on parlait de choses m\u00e9dicales -- de l'information m\u00e9dicale et j'ai dit je ne suis pas certain si cette personne a la comp\u00e9tence. Et puis j'ai dit -- j'avais de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 dire mes mots et alors j'ai dit, bien, je pense que c'est r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, ou quelque chose. Mais alors je me suis rendue compte, apr\u00e8s cela, comme, je me suis rendue compte que je venais juste de r\u00e9gurgiter quelque chose.\nQ : Quand M. Hortie vous a-t-il dit cela?\nR : C'\u00e9tait une fois lorsqu'il a dit que nous allions devoir nous conna\u00eetre l'un et l'autre \u00e0 un niveau tr\u00e8s profond. Alors, il devait partager -- il -- je devais partager des renseignements personnels avec lui et il me donnait, comme, cette directive au sujet du fait que j'\u00e9tais cens\u00e9e dire le mot confiance.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Madame Day, je me demande si je peux venir ici. Est-ce qu'il est juste de dire, madame Day, de sorte que -- vous \u00e9tiez \u00e0 votre avis programm\u00e9e pour dire cela?

Parlez-nous de quelques-unes de ces choses.\nR : Je ne pense pas que je veuille. Je sais qu'il a dit que -- il a dit que, lorsque cette exp\u00e9rience serait achev\u00e9e, j'allais me prendre la t\u00eate et dire aux gens que j'entendais des choses sur diff\u00e9rentes fr\u00e9quences.\nDes pages 3004 \u00e0 3006 :\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : \u00cates-vous en train de dire que vous faisiez ce que vous \u00e9tiez programm\u00e9e pour faire \u00e0 un niveau conscient?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Je suppose que M. Hortie, pour l'essentiel, me programmait au niveau conscient mais il -- je veux dire, il \u00e9tait capable de se servir de ces suggestions hypnotiques pour me programmer \u00e0 faire des choses au niveau subconscient mais pour ce qui est de mon psychisme et du fonctionnement interne de mon subconscient, il aurait \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 en prendre le contr\u00f4le.\nMme JOYCE THAYER : Pouvez-vous juste --\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Non--\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Vous parlez de la diff\u00e9rence qu'il y a entre votre conscient et votre subconscient ici et lorsque vous dites que M. Hortie et d'autres personnes vous ont programm\u00e9e, je suppose que vous dites qu'ils programmaient votre subconscient?\nCe n'est pas quelque chose dont vous \u00eates consciente mais plus tard cela arrive et vous songez \u00e0 ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 et vous le r\u00e9cup\u00e9rez de votre m\u00e9moire subconsciente? Est-ce cela, madame Day?\nR : Bien, je me demande presque si, comme, programmer est peut-\u00eatre une fa\u00e7on trop forte de parler. Je veux dire, \u00e7a revient \u00e0 parler d'intention.\nJe dois \u00eatre honn\u00eate avec vous, je n'ai pas l'impression que, comme, lorsque mes amis m'ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'ils voulaient que je me souvienne de certaines phrases cl\u00e9s ou de messages et de choses, qu'ils essayaient de faire quelque chose qui me cause du tort ou me blesse, mais je pense que la fa\u00e7on dont M. Hortie tente d'utiliser -- tente d'utiliser les suggestions sous hypnose et de prog -- ce que je dis c'est que M. Hortie cause beaucoup de tort et qu'il essaie d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment de me manipuler avec cette sorte de -- avec exactement cette sorte de --\nQ : Et--\nR : -- suggestion et manipulation mentale --\nQ : Et --\nR : -- et je suis une personne qui -- je suis -- je suis une cible parfaite pour un manipulateur de ce genre.\nQ : Donc, ce que vous dites, c'est qu'il \u00e9tait capable d'implanter dans votre subconscient des choses qu'il vous fallait transformer en acte des ann\u00e9es plus tard? Par exemple, lorsque vous avez laiss\u00e9 \u00e9chapper le mot confiance pendant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique?\nR : Hum hum et le fait de me tenir la t\u00eate et de dire que je recevais de l'information sur diff\u00e9rentes fr\u00e9quences.\nQ : Quand avez-vous fait cela?\nR : En m'en allant \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital. J'avais appel\u00e9 Kevin Duik pour savoir s'il \u00e9tait fameux et -- et puis je r\u00e9gurgitais tout \u00e7a et c'est une des choses qui est sortie et plus tard quand je l'ai retrac\u00e9e et que je me suis rendue compte que c'\u00e9tait -- c'\u00e9tait -- la source de cela c'\u00e9tait M.

Hortie.\nY a-t-il eu d'autres personnes dont vous pouvez vous rappeler qui, au cours de votre vie, vous ont fait des suggestions de ce genre, des suggestions auxquelles vous avez par la suite r\u00e9agi, les transformant en acte, et qu'il vous a fallu d\u00e9duire ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9?\nR : Oui, il y en a.\nQ : Pouvez-vous nous en parler s'il vous pla\u00eet?\nR : Quand j'\u00e9tais une jeune enfant, ma grand-m\u00e8re et ma tante et ma m\u00e8re m'ont emmen\u00e9e \u00e0 une \u00e9glise \u00e0 Calgary. Et il y avait tout un groupe d'enfants l\u00e0 et nous avons vu un pr\u00eatre et le pr\u00eatre nous parlait et j'\u00e9tais tr\u00e8s jeune.\nEt il a demand\u00e9 s'il y avait des volontaires, et j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 l'une des enfants ayant lev\u00e9 la main. Et il a \u00e9crit mon nom sur une liste, et il nous a dit que ce qu'il voulait que nous fassions c'est que si nous savions qu'il y avait un tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s mauvais homme, que nous allions pouvoir parler \u00e0 Dieu.\nEt ce qu'il voulait que nous fassions c'\u00e9tait de regarder \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre \u00e0 gauche, en haut de l'\u00e9glise. Et lorsque nous allions regarder l\u00e0, alors nous allions savoir que Dieu nous parlait et lorsqu'il faudrait dire aux gens o\u00f9 il y avait un homme vraiment m\u00e9chant, m\u00e9chant, que nous pouvions dire \u00e0 ces gens que Dieu nous parlait et que Dieu nous disait quoi faire.\nEt il a dit qu'il voulait que nous sachions, quelque chose comme, ces choses sont tr\u00e8s difficiles mais nous devions nous sentir en s\u00e9curit\u00e9, au fond de nous-m\u00eames, que nous -- que nous pouvions \u00eatre la voix de Dieu.\nQ : Et quand avez-vous transform\u00e9 en acte ce que le pr\u00eatre vous avait dit de faire lorsque vous \u00e9tiez une jeune enfant?\nR : Bien, je sais que quand j'ai eu mon audience de redressement de grief avec le capitaine Blattman, il n'a pas cru que j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e sexuellement et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me poser toutes sortes de questions tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s stupides et qui \u00e9taient simplement tr\u00e8s hostiles.\nEt je me souviens que j'avais vraiment peur que par la suite il penserait que j'\u00e9tais folle parce que je me souviens avoir regard\u00e9 vers le haut, \u00e0 gauche, puis avoir regard\u00e9 le capitaine Blattman et avoir dit nettement au capitaine Blattman, et parce que Dieu me dit de le dire, parce que Dieu me disait de pr\u00e9senter la plainte.\nMais alors, je pense que mon repr\u00e9sentant syndical a \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu ennuy\u00e9 par le fait que j'avais dit quelque chose comme \u00e7a et j'\u00e9tais, d'une certaine fa\u00e7on, ennuy\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet moi-m\u00eame. Et je n'ai pas -- cela m'a pris plus d'un an pour me rendre compte o\u00f9 cela -- d'o\u00f9 cette phrase que j'avais dite provenait parce que c'\u00e9tait quelque chose qu'on m'avait dit de faire quand j'\u00e9tais une tr\u00e8s jeune enfant et je l'ai fait sans y penser.\nMais lorsque -- cela m'a fait avoir l'air d'une folle mais quand -- et puis cela m'a pris longtemps pour comprendre pourquoi j'avais dit que Dieu me disait de leur dire cela.\nDes pages 3043 \u00e0 3047 :\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Madame Day, pouvez-vous nous parler de situations o\u00f9 M.

D'accord? Le fait qu'il pouvait physiquement me toucher, pousser sa langue dans ma bouche, mettre son p\u00e9nis dans mon corps - dans ma bouche, dans mon vagin et dans mon derri\u00e8re, le fait qu'il avait le droit, il se donnait le droit de faire ces choses contre ma volont\u00e9 et sans ma permission et le fait qu'il pouvait m\u00eame simplement me toucher. Comme - comme c'\u00e9tait assez.\nQ : Que voulez-vous --\nR : Apr\u00e8s un bout de temps, il suffisait d'un simple toucher, comme -- j'avais l'impression que tout mon corps \u00e9tait en feu.

M\u00eame juste -- et juste n'importe qui.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Et vous vous touchez tr\u00e8s doucement?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : N'importe qui qui fait simplement s'approcher de mon espace corporel me touchant comme cela me donnait l'impression -- j'avais l'impression d'\u00eatre comme une victime br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Qu'est-ce que vous voulez dire que cela avait renvers\u00e9 votre -- quels \u00e9taient les mots? Renvers\u00e9 votre perception de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9?\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Vous avez dit que vous aviez l'impression de marcher \u00e0 l'envers, la t\u00eate en bas, tout le temps?\nR : Oui. J'avais l'impression - cela -- la mani\u00e8re -- la mani\u00e8re dont mon esprit r\u00e9agissait \u00e0 cause de ce qu'il faisait c'\u00e9tait que, comme, j'\u00e9tais -- mon monde \u00e9tait habituellement normal. J'avais l'habitude de voir -- comme, j'avais l'habitude de voir les gens normalement. Comme vous \u00eates tous \u00e0 l'endroit mais l'impression que mon esprit me donnait lorsque M. Hortie me harcelait, j'avais l'impression que je voyais tout \u00e0 l'envers. Comme, c'\u00e9tait comme -- je m'excuse de dire des jurons. Je ne vais pas jurer.\nQ : D'accord.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Dites ce que vous voulez dire.\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Je me sentais tellement toute fourr\u00e9e dans ma t\u00eate \u00e0 cause de la fa\u00e7on dont M. Hortie colorait ma perception des choses et interpr\u00e9tait -- il interpr\u00e9tait toutes mes donn\u00e9es perceptuelles et me disait ce qui se passait au milieu de travail et dans ma -- dans ma propre vie personnelle que je v\u00e9rifiais en confrontant mes perceptions avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 moi-m\u00eame --\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Et vous dites qu'il pr\u00e9sentait tout de travers?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Il avait tout -- il me disait tout \u00e0 l'envers mais c'est la seule fa\u00e7on dont je peux vous l'expliquer.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Est-ce qu'il s'agissait seulement de M. Hortie ou s'agissait-il aussi d'autres gens?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Non, c'\u00e9tait seulement M. Hortie. Je veux dire, il y avait -- mais alors il y avait des choses circonstancielles venant de gens en milieu de travail qui appuyaient ce que M. Hortie disait qu'il m'arrivait.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Donc, comment avez-vous compos\u00e9 avec cela? Donc, vous voulez dire que vous --\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Cela -- cela m'a certainement in -- influenc\u00e9e et cela -- cela me donnait l'impression que j'\u00e9tais compl\u00e8tement incapable de -- de me sortir de cette situation. Je me sentais pi\u00e9g\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de l'existence de circonstances qui \u00e9taient - qui \u00e9taient des preuves tr\u00e8s solides que, en fait, je ne pouvais pas obtenir de l'aide et que je devais me conformer aux conditions qui \u00e9taient impos\u00e9es \u00e0 mon emploi.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Madame Thayer, il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une question importante et je pense que je devrais la poser. Et je sais que cela sera difficile pour vous, madame Day. Mais n'avez-vous pas envisag\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me soit dans votre t\u00eate?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Bien s\u00fbr j'ai examin\u00e9 le prob -- j'ai envisag\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait dans mon esprit, cela fait partie de la confrontation avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Donc, dites-moi --\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Parce que tout cela arrivait et je - je -- apr\u00e8s un bout de temps je suis devenue tellement m\u00eal\u00e9e, c'est un meilleur mot, je suis devenue tellement m\u00eal\u00e9e que je -- comme, je veux dire, j'\u00e9tais m\u00eal\u00e9e depuis le tout d\u00e9but. Disons simplement que, j'\u00e9tais en train de devenir vraiment, vraiment m\u00eal\u00e9e depuis le tout d\u00e9but.\nMais je suis devenue tellement gravement m\u00eal\u00e9e -- je suis devenue tellement gravement m\u00eal\u00e9e que je pouvais juste -- j'\u00e9tais juste -- je me sentais comme si j'\u00e9tais une carcasse. Je me sentais comme un corps mort, j'\u00e9tais compl\u00e8tement engourdie. Je veux dire, j'\u00e9tais engourdie depuis le d\u00e9but, mais je veux dire vraiment, vraiment, vraiment engourdie. Comme -- comme, j'avais l'impression qu'on m'avait inject\u00e9 des anesth\u00e9siques, j'\u00e9tais tellement engourdie, je n'avais plus aucun sentiment. Je n'avais pas une (1) once de sentiment.\nEt c'\u00e9tait avant sept -- comme, octobre de 1994, lorsque j'\u00e9tais de retour \u00e0 l'atelier \u00e0 l'\u00e9difice 190. J'\u00e9tais juste -- j'\u00e9tais un corps mort qui d\u00e9ambulait.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Et qu'est-ce qui est arriv\u00e9, madame Day? Est-ce que les choses se sont am\u00e9lior\u00e9es ou empir\u00e9es?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Bien, j'ai juste -- je pensais, bien, je vais prendre des risques. Et j'ai dit \u00e0 Rod Lundgren qu'il me fallait aller chez un psychologue et que je, vous savez, s'ils pouvaient -- s'ils pouvaient obtenir un psychologue pour moi que je leur en serais grandement reconnaissante.\nEt je -- comme, je le regrette vraiment mais je suis \u00e9videmment tellement -- je suis \u00e9videmment, vous savez, j'ai besoin d'un psychiatre tout de suite parce que je suis une personne gravement m\u00eal\u00e9e et je ne peux pas fonctionner.\nJe veux dire, et j'ai reconnu que je -- que j'\u00e9tais -- je veux dire que j'\u00e9tais comme, \u00e0 plat. Normalement, dans une journ\u00e9e, une personne a -- comme si nous traversions toute une gamme d'\u00e9motions. Dans -- dans une heure vous pouvez ressentir -- je ne sais pas combien d'\u00e9motions que vous pouvez ressentir, cinq (5) ou six (6) \u00e9motions importantes dans une heure, simplement par l'interm\u00e9diaire de vos pens\u00e9es naturelles ou de toute autre chose.\nMais, vous savez -- vous savez, vous montez, vous redescendez, \u00e7a monte \u00e7a descend, \u00e7a monte, \u00e7a descend. Mais j'\u00e9tais comme, \u00e0 plat. Je n'avais aucune \u00e9motion. J'\u00e9tais comme -- j'\u00e9tais comme un corps mort. Et c'\u00e9tait tout comme, vous savez, je suis \u00e9videmment tellement folle \u00e0 cause de ma -- je sais qu'on me harc\u00e8le pr\u00e9sentement ici, et je sais que toutes ces choses arrivent, mais ce gars-l\u00e0 me dit des choses comme, bien, si quelqu'un s'informe de mes probl\u00e8mes, dis-leur simplement que nous allons nous marier et des choses du m\u00eame genre.\nEt puis les menaces et puis -- et puis, quand j'ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler -- lorsque les gens me parlaient en milieu de travail, les menaces physiques, qu'il allait blesser d'autres gens, ou qu'il allait me blesser.\nEt je ne savais encore o\u00f9 son fusil \u00e9tait, vous savez. Il va se faire sauter la cervelle et il va le faire dans ma maison. Tout cela \u00e9tait des choses vraiment \u00e9peurantes. Et, oui, j'avais des doutes -- je -- c'est une -- je pense que c'est naturel, un processus sain. Si vous ne confrontez pas vos perceptions avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, vous -- si une personne ne v\u00e9rifie pas quel est son rapport avec le monde r\u00e9el, alors c'est ce genre de personne que vous voyez dans les h\u00f4pitaux.\nEt le fait que je pensais que j'\u00e9tais, que je pourrais \u00eatre folle, je pense que cela est un indice que j'\u00e9tais en v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en sant\u00e9. Mais j'\u00e9tais vraiment, vraiment m\u00eal\u00e9e. Et il me fallait avoir -- et c'est pourquoi j'ai demand\u00e9 si je pouvais aller voir -- avoir un psychologue.\nAUTRE EXTRAIT\nDes pages 3077 \u00e0 3080 :\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Mais ce dont il vous faut parler c'est de votre aptitude \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Et le probl\u00e8me est que vous avez dit un certain nombre de choses qui montrent clairement que vous pouvez difficilement distinguer entre vos perceptions et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\nMme Amanda Day : Je ne pense pas que je --\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Et que ces perceptions --\nMme Amanda Day : -- J'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 distinguer entre mes perceptions et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Je pense, il est clair que l'employeur applique un processus de brouillage, et il est clair que mes perceptions sont color\u00e9es par M. Hortie. Et, clairement, lorsque vous ouvrez le voir-dire, et je comprends qu'il y a des questions d'habilit\u00e9 et qu'il y a des questions juridiques, que je ne comprends pas.\nMais lorsque les gens -- je veux dire, m\u00eame si des personnes me disent qu'elles ont l'impression que je souffre de parano\u00efa et de pens\u00e9e d\u00e9lirante, alors cela influence ma perception au point o\u00f9 je dois m'interroger moi-m\u00eame, \u00e0 savoir si oui ou non je souffre de parano\u00efa et de pens\u00e9e d\u00e9lirante.\nDonc c'est comme le principe d'incertitude de Hydenberg (phon\u00e9tique), vous --vous ne pouvez mesurer une (1) chose et vous ne pouvez savoir avec certitude la position d'une (1) chose, lorsque -- lorsque vous essayez de faire quelque chose d'autre.\nEt la situation devient tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 r\u00e9gler. Et je vous dis que, ma perception de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est valide. Et votre perception de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est la v\u00f4tre. Et la v\u00f4tre est diff\u00e9rente et la mienne est diff\u00e9rente; cela ne veut pas dire que la mienne est mauvaise ou que je suis handicap\u00e9e.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Je pense que je me trouve dans la situation o\u00f9 je dois supposer qu'une partie de ce que vous nous avez dit, est arriv\u00e9 dans votre esprit plut\u00f4t que dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\nMme Amanda Day : Bien, je pense que d\u00e9finitivement cette personne -- ce que M. Hortie m'a fait, c'\u00e9tait de m\u00e9langer ma t\u00eate d'une fa\u00e7on qui a fait qu'il a pu ex\u00e9cuter ces abus sexuels et ces agressions sexuelles et ce harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\nEt c'est clair, qu'il y a plusieurs choses qui m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dites, et qu'il a manip -- qu'il a manipul\u00e9 ma perception et qu'il -- M. Hortie a fauss\u00e9 ma perception \u00e0 ce moment.\nMais je vous dis que, maintenant, je suis consciente que ces choses arrivaient et que je sais pourquoi j'\u00e9prouvais tellement de difficult\u00e9. Je ne dis pas que j'ai encore ces probl\u00e8mes maintenant, ce qui est fondamentalement diff\u00e9rent du fait que je sois consciente de ce qui m'arrivait alors, en r\u00e9trospective.\n(BR\u00c8VE PAUSE)\nMme Amanda Day : Toutefois, je, moi-m\u00eame, je -- j'en suis \u00e0 me poser des questions \u00e0 savoir si oui ou non je suis toujours sous l'influence des directives que m'a donn\u00e9es M. Hortie, des choses par suggestion. Je ne suis pas s\u00fbre jusqu'\u00e0 quel point je suis suicidaire, je ne suis pas s\u00fbre jusqu'\u00e0 quel point je peux me blesser.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Cela me pr\u00e9occupe, madame Day.\nMme Amanda Day : Oui, et cela me pr\u00e9occupe aussi. Et lorsque je suis all\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison hier, j'ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre -- commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 penser et \u00e0 essayer de comprendre ce qui, vous savez -- parce que je pense que c'est l\u00e0 une autre chose que les gens aiment faire, c'est de vous m\u00e9langer tellement qu'ils -- ils peuvent m\u00eame, vous savez, d'une certaine mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9dire la voie que vous prendrez plus tard.\nEt, je veux dire, il me disait des choses comme, le harc\u00e8lement allait me faire sentir -- j'allais avoir tellement un sentiment de, tellement, tellement de peine parce que j'\u00e9tais harcel\u00e9e par tous ces gens. Alors que c'\u00e9tait celui qui influen\u00e7ait ma perception et me disait que personne ne m'aimait et que personne ne voulait travailler avec moi.\nDonc, ce sont des choses qui ont m\u00fbri au fil du temps, que je n'ai pas comprises. Mais elles m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es par suggestion par -- \u00e0 moi par M. Hortie. Je me trouve donc au point o\u00f9 il me reste \u00e0 me demander, bien, je ne sais pas ce qu'il a implant\u00e9 d'autre dans mon esprit.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Avez-vous --\nMme Amanda Day : Et la question de savoir si je suis ou non suicidaire est une autre -- est une autre chose \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration pour -- pour une victime de ce genre. S'il vous devez envisager, je suppose, qu'il y a -- qu'il y a un grave danger que je puisse --\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Avez-vous parl\u00e9 \u00e0 --\nMme Amanda Day : -- me blesser moi-m\u00eame -",

Mactavish\n2003 TCDP 15\n2003\/04\/02\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Le Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec inc. (le Groupe d\u2019aide) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte all\u00e9guant que Jean Barbe a harcel\u00e9 Mireille Des Rosiers pendant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada. L\u2019all\u00e9gation porte que ce harc\u00e8lement \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur le sexe, la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique de Mme Des Rosiers. Le Groupe d\u2019aide a, \u00e9videmment, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une seconde plainte au nom de Mme Des Rosiers, en l\u2019occurrence contre son employeur, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada. La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e pendant que l\u2019affaire \u00e9tait devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de la plainte contre M. Barbe.\n[2] M. Barbe demande que soit produit le protocole d\u2019entente \u00e9non\u00e7ant le r\u00e8glement qui est intervenu entre le Groupe d\u2019aide et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada. Le Groupe d\u2019aide, Radio-Canada et la Commission s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la divulgation de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement en faisant valoir que l\u2019entente est privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e et que, de toute fa\u00e7on, elle ne rev\u00eat aucune pertinence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des points en litige figurant dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Barbe.\n[3] La Commission a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que Mme Des Rosiers soit ajout\u00e9e comme plaignante dans le cadre de cette proc\u00e9dure.\n[4] Lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, le membre du Tribunal charg\u00e9 d\u2019entendre cette cause a propos\u00e9 aux parties de faire statuer un autre membre du Tribunal sur ces requ\u00eates. Je pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019il a fait cette proposition en se fondant sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se qu\u2019il pourrait devenir n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner la teneur de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. La Commission et Radio-Canada ont toutes deux demand\u00e9 que ces requ\u00eates soient entendues par une autre personne que le membre charg\u00e9 d\u2019entendre cette cause. M. Barbe d\u00e9clare que cette solution serait acceptable \u00e0 ses yeux si l\u2019entente devait \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9e afin d\u2019en \u00e9tablir la pertinence.\n[5] Compte tenu des circonstances, un autre membre du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi des requ\u00eates.\nI. REQU\u00caTE DE M. BARBE POUR LA PRODUCTION DE L\u2019ENTENTE DE R\u00c8GLEMENT [6] La demande de M. Barbe soul\u00e8ve deux questions. La premi\u00e8re est de savoir si l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement \u00e0 laquelle est partie Radio-Canada est pertinente dans le cadre de cette proc\u00e9dure. La seconde est de savoir si l\u2019entente est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par un privil\u00e8ge. Je traiterai d\u2019abord de la question de la pertinence, car si je devais conclure que l\u2019entente n\u2019a aucune pertinence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette proc\u00e9dure, il serait inutile d\u2019aborder la question du privil\u00e8ge.\nA. L\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement est-elle potentiellement pertinente dans le cadre de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Barbe?\n[7] M. Barbe soutient que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement conclue par le Groupe d\u2019aide et Radio-Canada pr\u00e9sente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments pertinents en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9 et de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. En ce qui concerne la responsabilit\u00e9, M. Barbe d\u00e9clare que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Radio-Canada de m\u00eame que celle d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui \u00e9manent toutes deux de la m\u00eame situation de fait sur les lieux de travail. M. Barbe agissait dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions lorsqu\u2019il traitait avec Mme Des Rosiers. Il croit savoir que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement envisageait le retrait de la plainte contre Radio-Canada et de la plainte contre lui. Il n\u2019a cependant pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 au Tribunal sur quoi il se fondait pour formuler cet avis.\n[8] Comme Mme Des Rosiers a perdu ses droits contre Radio-Canada et lui-m\u00eame, M. Barbe d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle n\u2019a plus le droit de le poursuivre dans cette affaire. Il s\u2019ensuit que le Groupe d\u2019aide ne peut pas poursuivre l\u2019affaire au nom de Mme Des Rosiers, ce qui rend le Tribunal incomp\u00e9tent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette plainte. Une disposition de confidentialit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour emp\u00eacher la divulgation lorsque celle-ci est n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9terminer si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la cause.\n[9] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, M. Barbe d\u00e9clare que tout argent re\u00e7u par Mme Des Rosiers de Radio-Canada devrait \u00eatre pris en compte par le Tribunal lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9valuera les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Barbe, afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher que Mme Des Rosiers touche une double indemnisation.\n[10] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne fait valoir que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Barbe est distincte de celle d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Radio-Canada. Les redressements sollicit\u00e9s contre M. Barbe sont distincts de ceux pour lesquels Radio-Canada peut \u00eatre tenue responsable. Par cons\u00e9quent, le r\u00e8glement intervenu avec Radio-Canada n\u2019a aucune pertinence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Barbe. La Commission soutient par ailleurs qu\u2019il irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du bon sens et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement intervenu entre le Groupe d\u2019aide et Radio-Canada puisse permettre \u00e0 M. Barbe de se soustraire \u00e0 ses responsabilit\u00e9s.\n[11] Pour ce qui est de la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, la Commission d\u00e9clare que les seuls dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats auxquels Mme Des Rosiers pourrait avoir droit sont ceux pour lesquels elle n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9dommag\u00e9e. La Commission fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de probl\u00e8me de double indemnisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires et cite \u00e0 l\u2019appui la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019affaire Ghosh c. Domglas Inc. (No 2) comme faisant autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019assertion que des intim\u00e9s diff\u00e9rents peuvent \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 verser des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires distincts.\n[12] Radio-Canada fait valoir que M. Barbe n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer en quoi l\u2019entente est pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des points en litige dans ce cas. Selon Radio-Canada, ce r\u00e8glement transcende la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre elle et r\u00e8gle \u00e9galement le litige impliquant Mme Des Rosiers, Radio-Canada et le syndicat de Mme Des Rosiers.\n[13] Selon Radio-Canada, les questions traitant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ne seront abord\u00e9es que plus loin dans la proc\u00e9dure et encore seulement si la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Barbe est fond\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, Radio-Canada soutient que la question de la divulgation devrait \u00eatre report\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que celle des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats soit abord\u00e9e.\n[14] Le Groupe d\u2019aide d\u00e9clare que l\u2019entente en cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue entre Mme Des Rosiers et Radio-Canada. Selon le Groupe d\u2019aide, les causes d\u2019action invoqu\u00e9es contre Radio-Canada et M. Barbe sont distinctes. En tant qu\u2019employeur de Mme Des Rosiers, Radio-Canada est responsable des gestes de harc\u00e8lement pos\u00e9s sur les lieux de travail, tandis que M. Barbe est responsable de sa propre conduite.\n[15] Le Groupe d\u2019aide d\u00e9clare que M. Barbe ne devrait pas pouvoir utiliser le r\u00e8glement intervenu entre Mme Des Rosiers et Radio-Canada pour se tirer d\u2019affaire. Bien au contraire, M. Barbe doit assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 de ses actes et en accepter les cons\u00e9quences.\nII. ANALYSE [16] Je suis convaincu que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement est potentiellement pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard, \u00e0 la fois, de la responsabilit\u00e9 et des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Pour ce qui est de la responsabilit\u00e9, il me semble que l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la lib\u00e9ration que peut avoir accord\u00e9e le Groupe d\u2019aide ou Mme Des Rosiers peut \u00eatre potentiellement pertinente pour d\u00e9terminer la responsabilit\u00e9 de M. Barbe. Il s\u2019agit plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de savoir si des employ\u00e9s, agents ou serviteurs de Radio-Canada ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9gag\u00e9s de responsabilit\u00e9 par Mme Des Rosiers ou le Groupe d\u2019aide ou en leur nom.\n[17] En ce qui concerne la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, je suis convaincu que le r\u00e8glement intervenu avec Radio-Canada fait surgir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une double indemnisation de Mme Des Rosiers. Dans le questionnaire qu\u2019elle a rempli et dans la divulgation qu\u2019elle a faite pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 l\u2019audience, la Commission a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pourrait demander le recouvrement du salaire que Mme Des Rosiers peut avoir perdu \u00e0 la suite des pr\u00e9tendus actes de M. Barbe. De toute \u00e9vidence, tout argent que Mme Des Rosiers peut d\u00e9j\u00e0 avoir re\u00e7u de Radio-Canada pour les pertes de salaire devrait \u00eatre pris en compte dans la formulation du redressement contre M. Barbe, afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher un double recouvrement.\n[18] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la demande de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires, la question de savoir si les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires vers\u00e9s par l\u2019un des intim\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre pris en compte lorsque l\u2019on accorde un redressement similaire contre un intim\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent s\u2019est pos\u00e9e lors de plusieurs cas r\u00e9cents. Contrairement \u00e0 la position adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat de la Commission dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Woiden et autres c. Lynn indique que l\u2019avocat de la Commission a adopt\u00e9 une position diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9e dans cette cause. Dans Woiden, la Commission a soutenu que le paiement de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires par un employeur devrait \u00eatre pris en compte dans les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats impos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019auteur du harc\u00e8lement lui-m\u00eame. Le Tribunal a \u00e9valu\u00e9 les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats en se fondant sur ce principe. De m\u00eame, dans l\u2019affaire Bushey c. Sharma , le Tribunal a not\u00e9 qu\u2019un tel paiement effectu\u00e9 par un employeur pouvait \u00eatre pertinent dans certaines circonstances. Comme je l\u2019ai relev\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, dans l\u2019affaire Ghosh, la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ontario a jug\u00e9 que des intim\u00e9s diff\u00e9rents peuvent \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 verser des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires distincts.\n[19] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que j\u2019\u00e9tablisse si les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires pay\u00e9s par l\u2019un des intim\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre pris en compte lorsque l\u2019on accorde un redressement semblable contre un intim\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure. Je me contenterai de dire que je suis convaincu que le montant de tout paiement effectu\u00e9 par Radio-Canada \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers pour ses pertes non p\u00e9cuniaires est potentiellement pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires r\u00e9clam\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Barbe.\n[20] Comme j\u2019ai conclu que certains aspects de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement relative \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Radio-Canada sont potentiellement pertinents dans le cadre de la poursuite intent\u00e9e contre M. Barbe, la question est de savoir si l\u2019entente est privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e et de ce fait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre la divulgation.\nA. L\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement est-elle privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e?\n[21] La Commission soutient que l\u2019entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue dans le cadre du processus de conciliation de la Commission et qu\u2019elle est par cons\u00e9quent privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. Selon la Commission, le privil\u00e8ge ne s\u2019applique pas seulement aux n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement proprement dite. L\u2019entente comporte par ailleurs une clause de confidentialit\u00e9 qui d\u00e9montre que les parties s\u2019attendent \u00e0 ce que l\u2019entente demeure priv\u00e9e.\n[22] La Commission d\u00e9clare que dans ce cas, l\u2019entente ne fait pas partie d\u2019une des exceptions reconnues au privil\u00e8ge d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un r\u00e8glement. Selon la Commission, les questions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019entente ne peuvent se poser qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019endroit des parties \u00e0 l\u2019entente proprement dite, et non \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un tiers qui n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 l\u2019entente tel que M. Barbe. Par ailleurs, l\u2019audition de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Barbe ne soul\u00e8ve pas de question relative \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019entente et ne cr\u00e9e de ce fait pas de situation exceptionnelle.\n[23] La Commission note par ailleurs que les ententes de r\u00e8glement vis\u00e9es dans les affaires Woiden et Bushey n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 conclues dans le cadre du processus de conciliation de la Commission et que ces d\u00e9cisions sont de ce fait d\u2019une esp\u00e8ce diff\u00e9rente.\n[24] Radio-Canada soutient que les parties s\u2019attendaient \u00e0 ce que l\u2019entente demeure confidentielle, principalement afin de prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats de Radio-Canada. Aux dires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, si l\u2019entente \u00e9tait divulgu\u00e9e, ses droits seraient l\u00e9s\u00e9s. Radio-Canada ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas sur l\u2019effet qu\u2019une divulgation aurait sur ses droits.\n[25] Le Groupe d\u2019aide n\u2019a pas fait de pr\u00e9sentation sur la question du privil\u00e8ge.\n[26] M. Barbe d\u00e9clare que les parties opposantes ne se sont pas acquitt\u00e9es du fardeau qui leur incombait d\u2019\u00e9tablir que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement est en fait privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. M. Barbe affirme que, m\u00eame si l\u2019entente est privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e, le privil\u00e8ge prot\u00e9geant les r\u00e8glements a des limites, et il cite les exceptions mentionn\u00e9es dans Sopinka . Il cite la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans Bushey comme faisant autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019affirmation que le privil\u00e8ge porte sur les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement et non sur l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Tout en admettant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public sous-tendant le principe que les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement doivent rester confidentielles, M. Barbe fait valoir qu\u2019une partie ne devrait pas \u00eatre en mesure, en invoquant la disposition de confidentialit\u00e9 d\u2019une entente de r\u00e8glement, de poursuivre une tierce partie en violation des modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019entente.\n[27] M. Barbe soutient que la jurisprudence \u00e9tablit que le privil\u00e8ge peut \u00eatre lev\u00e9 lorsque l\u2019on peut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019un document est potentiellement pertinent pour la cause d\u2019une des parties. Il n\u2019a cependant cit\u00e9 aucun document faisant autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette affirmation.\n[28] Enfin, M. Barbe d\u00e9clare que le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il subirait si l\u2019entente n\u2019\u00e9tait pas divulgu\u00e9e d\u00e9passerait celui que subiraient les autres parties si la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019entente n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9serv\u00e9e.\nB. Analyse\n[29] La requ\u00eate de M. Barbe m\u2019oblige \u00e0 parvenir \u00e0 un \u00e9quilibre entre deux consid\u00e9rations de principe \u00e0 la fois importantes et antagonistes : en l\u2019occurrence, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui consiste \u00e0 promouvoir le r\u00e8glement de litiges en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et l\u2019exigence en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 voulant que les parties \u00e0 un litige en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre pour pr\u00e9senter leurs positions.\n[30] Deux dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre prises en ligne de compte lorsqu\u2019on d\u00e9termine comment ces int\u00e9r\u00eats antagonistes peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9solus. Le paragraphe 47(3) dispose comme suit :\nLes renseignements recueillis par le conciliateur sont confidentiels et ne peuvent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s sans le consentement de la personne qui les a fournis.\nLe paragraphe 50(4) se lit comme suit :\nIl ne peut admettre en preuve les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui, dans le droit de la preuve, sont confidentiels devant les tribunaux judiciaires.\n[31] Je me propose d\u2019examiner d\u2019abord la question plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de savoir si l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement est privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 une tierce partie dans des circonstances telles que celles qui se pr\u00e9sentent dans ce cas. J\u2019examinerai ensuite de quelle mani\u00e8re le paragraphe 47(3) de la Loi s\u2019applique \u00e0 des ententes de r\u00e8glement conclues dans le cadre du processus de conciliation de la Commission.\n[32] Pour ce qui est de la question g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du privil\u00e8ge d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un r\u00e8glement, la loi \u00e9tablit clairement que les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement sont soumises au privil\u00e8ge et ne peuvent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es que dans des circonstances bien d\u00e9limit\u00e9es. Un principe contraignant d\u2019ordre public sous-tend cette r\u00e8gle: les parties doivent \u00eatre encourag\u00e9es \u00e0 essayer de r\u00e9gler leurs diff\u00e9rends par la n\u00e9gociation et ne doivent pas \u00eatre entrav\u00e9es dans leurs efforts par la crainte que des admissions ou des concessions faites lors des n\u00e9gociations pourraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es contre elles, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 les n\u00e9gociations n\u2019aboutiraient pas au r\u00e8glement du diff\u00e9rend.\n[33] La jurisprudence relative \u00e0 la nature privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e des n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement est relativement claire, mais celle portant sur les ententes de r\u00e8glement conclues est moins limpide. Bon nombre de d\u00e9bats dans la jurisprudence s\u2019articulent autour de la question de savoir si les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement perdent leur caract\u00e8re privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019elles aboutissent \u00e0 une entente. Sopinka laisse entendre que lorsque les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement aboutissent \u00e0 une entente, la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces n\u00e9gociations peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme preuve du r\u00e8glement, lorsque l\u2019existence ou l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019entente est mise en question. Comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 mon coll\u00e8gue dans l\u2019affaire Bushey, les exceptions cit\u00e9es par Sopinka portent sur la divulgation des n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement dans des situations pr\u00e9cises. Il n\u2019y a aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence explicite \u00e0 la question de savoir si des ententes de r\u00e8glement peuvent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es, et Sopinka non plus ne laisse pas entendre que les ententes de r\u00e8glement ne peuvent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles.\n[34] La jurisprudence ne fait pas l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 sur ce point. Dans Derco Industries Ltd. c. A.R. Grimwood Ltd., la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique a permis la divulgation \u00e0 un plaignant des documents de r\u00e8glement (y compris les documents portant sur les n\u00e9gociations, de m\u00eame que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement proprement dite), dans une cause o\u00f9 une entente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue par plusieurs d\u00e9fendeurs dans un diff\u00e9rend portant sur la construction. En ordonnant que le document soit divulgu\u00e9, la Cour a not\u00e9 que la pond\u00e9ration d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats divergents peut \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente lorsque la demande de divulgation provient d\u2019un tiers qui n\u2019est pas partie aux n\u00e9gociations, mais dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats peuvent \u00eatre l\u00e9s\u00e9s par le r\u00e8glement. Cette d\u00e9cision a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique. Cependant, la Cour d\u2019appel a express\u00e9ment refus\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9mettre un avis sur la question de savoir si un tiers qui n\u2019est pas partie aux n\u00e9gociations se trouve dans une situation diff\u00e9rente envers les parties elles-m\u00eames.\n[35] La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a r\u00e9examin\u00e9 la question dans Middelkamp v. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board. Le point en litige dans Middelkamp \u00e9tait la production de documents \u00e9chang\u00e9s pendant les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement, qui avait abouti \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une ordonnance sur consentement. En \u00e9tablissant que les documents \u00e9taient privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s et de ce fait non sujets \u00e0 production, la Cour a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que les documents \u00e9tablis \u00ab sous toutes r\u00e9serves \u00bb communiqu\u00e9s au cours des n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement sont vis\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge g\u00e9n\u00e9rique, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait qu\u2019une entente soit conclue ou non. En parvenant \u00e0 cette conclusion, la Cour a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019affaire Derco avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal tranch\u00e9e. Il convient de noter, cependant, que la question dans Middelkamp \u00e9tait la possibilit\u00e9 de divulguer des documents \u00e9chang\u00e9s pendant les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement. La Cour n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 examiner si l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement proprement dite pouvait \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9e.\n[36] Cette distinction a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc de la Reine de l\u2019Alberta dans Ed Miller Sales & Rentals Ltd. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co.; la Cour a examin\u00e9 si un tiers non partie \u00e0 des n\u00e9gociations n\u2019aboutissant pas \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement pouvait obtenir de l\u2019information sur les n\u00e9gociations pendant un interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable. En concluant qu\u2019un tiers non partie aux n\u00e9gociations n\u2019avait pas le droit d\u2019obtenir la divulgation de la teneur des n\u00e9gociations n\u2019ayant pas abouti, la Cour a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019affaire Derco \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente, en se fondant sur le fait que dans cette affaire, un r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu.\n[37] La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a r\u00e9cemment eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019examiner la question de la possibilit\u00e9 de divulguer une entente de r\u00e8glement dans British Columbia Children\u2019s Hospital v. Air Products Canada Ltd.; ce cas portait sur un r\u00e8glement entre un plaignant et plusieurs d\u00e9fendeurs dans le cadre d\u2019une action en justice impliquant plusieurs parties. La Cour a conclu que sa d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure dans Middelkamp constituait une autorit\u00e9 contraignante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019assertion que les ententes de r\u00e8glement sont privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es et de ce fait soustraites \u00e0 divulgation. Nonobstant cette conclusion, cependant, il semble que la Cour n\u2019ait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que ce privil\u00e8ge est absolu, car elle a confirm\u00e9 par la suite la partie de la d\u00e9cision du juge des requ\u00eates exigeant la divulgation de toute disposition de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement qui pourrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une lib\u00e9ration, selon le principe qu\u2019elle pouvait \u00e9ventuellement avoir une pertinence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de points qui \u00e9taient toujours en litige. Il semble donc que la divulgation puisse \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e dans des situations o\u00f9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement peut \u00eatre potentiellement pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions qui sont toujours en litige.\n[38] Il convient de se rappeler que ce sont les dispositions de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement intervenue entre le Groupe d\u2019aide et Radio-Canada qui peuvent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es comme une lib\u00e9ration \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Barbe que je trouve potentiellement pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 dans cette cause.\n[39] La Chambre des lords a examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de divulguer de la correspondance menant \u00e0 la conclusion d\u2019une entente de r\u00e8glement dans Rush & Tompkins Ltd. v. Greater London Council and Another. La Cour a conclu que la correspondance envoy\u00e9e \u00ab sous toutes r\u00e9serves \u00bb au cours de n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement demeure privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e, m\u00eame si une entente est conclue. La correspondance n\u2019a donc pu \u00eatre admise dans la proc\u00e9dure ult\u00e9rieure portant sur le m\u00eame sujet, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait qu\u2019elle impliquait la m\u00eame partie ou des parties diff\u00e9rentes. Pour parvenir \u00e0 cette conclusion, la Cour a not\u00e9 qu\u2019en permettant que des admissions faites dans le but d\u2019arriver \u00e0 un compromis soient utilis\u00e9es dans une proc\u00e9dure ult\u00e9rieure on contribuerait \u00e0 d\u00e9courager les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en vue d\u2019arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour a conclu que les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement ne doivent pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que les n\u00e9gociations aient par la suite abouti \u00e0 une entente ou non. Dans ce cas encore, la Cour se penchait cependant sur la production de correspondance menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement, par opposition \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement proprement dite.\n[40] La Cour d\u2019appel anglaise a par la suite eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019envisager l\u2019application de la d\u00e9cision de la Chambre des lords dans l\u2019affaire Rush & Tompkins \u00e0 une cause o\u00f9 une entente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue. Dans l\u2019affaire Gnitrow Ltd. v. Cape PLC., la Cour a sursis \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation contre un d\u00e9fendeur jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le plaignant ait divulgu\u00e9 les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019une entente conclue entre le plaignant et d\u2019autres parties. La divulgation \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire parce qu\u2019il existait un rapport entre ce que le plaignant r\u00e9clamait du d\u00e9fendeur et l\u2019argent que le plaignant avait d\u00fb payer aux autres parties. En rendant cette ordonnance, la Cour a indiqu\u00e9 que chaque cas dans lequel on demandait d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement devait \u00eatre examin\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances particuli\u00e8res en cause.\n[41] Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe une relation possible entre l\u2019argent que le plaignant ou Mme Des Rosiers a re\u00e7u de Radio-Canada et les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9clam\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Barbe.\n[42] Pour d\u00e9terminer si une entente de r\u00e8glement est privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e et de ce fait soustraite \u00e0 la divulgation, il est utile de se souvenir des raisons d\u2019ordre public qui sous-tendent la reconnaissance du privil\u00e8ge d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un r\u00e8glement. Comme l\u2019a relev\u00e9 Sopinka en examinant le privil\u00e8ge li\u00e9 aux n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement, [Traduction] \u00ab ... la r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion avait pour objet de celer une proposition de r\u00e8glement uniquement en cas de tentative de l\u2019\u00e9tablir comme preuve de responsabilit\u00e9 ou de cause d\u2019action faible, et non quand elle est utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres fins \u00bb.\n[43] Si l\u2019on s\u2019en tient \u00e0 ce principe, il semble que si les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement sont privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement soit finalement conclu ou non, l\u2019entente proprement dite, par contre, n\u2019est pas vis\u00e9e par un privil\u00e8ge absolu et peut \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019elle se rapporte \u00e0 des questions encore en litige dans une proc\u00e9dure. Tant et aussi longtemps que l\u2019entente est potentiellement pertinente, sauf en tant qu\u2019aveu, et n\u2019est pas utilis\u00e9e simplement pour \u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019une partie ou la faiblesse de la position de cette partie, le privil\u00e8ge n\u2019en interdit pas la production.\n[44] Comme j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement n\u2019est pas vis\u00e9e par un privil\u00e8ge absolu et peut \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019elle a trait \u00e0 des questions en litige en cours de proc\u00e9dure, le paragraphe 50(4) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne s\u2019applique plus. Il reste \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si le fait qu\u2019une entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue dans le cadre du processus de conciliation de la Commission influe sur la possibilit\u00e9 de divulguer l\u2019entente.\n[45] La seule jurisprudence dont j\u2019ai connaissance et qui examine cette disposition de la loi est la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Paul. Dans ce cas, le point en litige \u00e9tait le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de fournir aux commissaires de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne de l\u2019information portant sur les tentatives de conciliation n\u2019ayant pas abouti, y compris une offre de r\u00e8glement, afin qu\u2019ils les prennent en compte pour d\u00e9cider de la fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9gler l\u2019affaire.\n[46] La Cour a conclu que le paragraphe 47(3) \u00e9non\u00e7ait une interdiction absolue contre la divulgation de toute information re\u00e7ue par le conciliateur. La Cour a \u00e9galement relev\u00e9 qu\u2019une telle prohibition \u00e9tait coh\u00e9rente avec le privil\u00e8ge d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un r\u00e8glement \u00e9tabli dans la common law portant sur les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019autant plus n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la nature obligatoire de la conciliation par la Commission.\n[47] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus haut, l\u2019affaire Paul traite la divulgation de n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de d\u00e9terminer si une entente de r\u00e8glement n\u00e9goci\u00e9e dans le cadre du processus de conciliation pouvait \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9e. La Cour a relev\u00e9, incidemment, que l\u2019article 48 de la Loi exige que la Commission approuve les r\u00e8glements conclus avant le d\u00e9but des audiences. De l\u2019avis de la Cour, une demande d\u2019approbation de la Commission est assimil\u00e9e au consentement de divulgation des modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019entente. Cette d\u00e9claration incidente peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme signifiant que le paragraphe 47(3) exige que l\u2019on obtienne un consentement pour la divulgation d\u2019ententes conclues dans le cadre du processus de conciliation.\n[48] Il faut cependant prendre en consid\u00e9ration le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 47(3) lui-m\u00eame. La version fran\u00e7aise dudit paragraphe se lit comme suit : \u00ab Les renseignements recueillis par le conciliateur sont confidentiels ... \u00bb, alors que la version anglaise renvoie aux renseignements re\u00e7us par le conciliateur en ces termes \u00ab ... in the course of attempting to reach a settlement ... \u00bb. On peut donc soutenir que la version anglaise ne porte que sur les communications faites pendant les n\u00e9gociations menant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement et non sur l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement proprement dite. Cette interpr\u00e9tation serait coh\u00e9rente avec les consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre public examin\u00e9es plus haut dans cette d\u00e9cision, portant que toute concession ou admission faite par une partie lors d\u2019une conciliation ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e contre elle lorsque l\u2019entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue.\n[49] Pour ces raisons, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement n\u2019est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e ni par le privil\u00e8ge d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative ni par le privil\u00e8ge de common law.\nC. L\u2019entente doit-elle \u00eatre produite int\u00e9gralement?\n[50] M\u00eame si j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement n\u2019est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e ni par un privil\u00e8ge d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative ni par un privil\u00e8ge de common law, nul ne conteste que l\u2019entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue par les parties dans l\u2019attente qu\u2019elle demeurerait confidentielle. Dans ces circonstances, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019entente ne doit pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9e au-del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour donner \u00e0 M. Barbe l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9parer une r\u00e9ponse et une d\u00e9fense compl\u00e8tes \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui. Par cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019impose certaines modalit\u00e9s \u00e0 la divulgation.\n[51] Pour garantir que seuls les renseignements confidentiels absolument n\u00e9cessaires pour garantir une audience \u00e9quitable soient divulgu\u00e9s, j\u2019instruis la Commission et le Groupe d\u2019aide \u00e0 remettre un exemplaire de l\u2019entente au greffe du Tribunal dans les cinq jours suivant la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, afin que je puisse l\u2019examiner et garantir que seules les dispositions potentiellement pertinentes soient divulgu\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Barbe.\n[52] Ce qu\u2019il est permis de consid\u00e9rer comme potentiellement pertinent \u00e0 ce point d\u00e9pendra du fait que les questions de la responsabilit\u00e9 et des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats seront trait\u00e9es simultan\u00e9ment ou non. Si je me fonde sur les renseignements en ma possession, il semble que seule une partie de l\u2019entente se rapportera vraisemblablement \u00e0 la question de la responsabilit\u00e9. Les autres dispositions pourraient \u00eatre pertinentes pour l\u2019\u00e9valuation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. \u00c0 ce point, les questions de la responsabilit\u00e9 et des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dissoci\u00e9es. Je me propose d\u2019examiner le document et de remettre \u00e0 M. Barbe les parties potentiellement pertinentes \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de responsabilit\u00e9 et de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, \u00e0 moins que je re\u00e7oive une requ\u00eate de l\u2019une des deux parties pour une disjonction de l\u2019audience. Toute requ\u00eate dans ce sens doit \u00eatre re\u00e7ue par le Tribunal dans les sept jours suivant la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[53] Si une demande de disjonction est re\u00e7ue, seules les dispositions de l\u2019entente potentiellement pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 seront divulgu\u00e9es, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la demande de disjonction soit prise. Dans le cas o\u00f9 le membre charg\u00e9 d\u2019entendre cette cause d\u00e9cide de scinder l\u2019audience, les dispositions de l\u2019entente potentiellement pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ne seront pas divulgu\u00e9es \u00e0 ce moment.\n[54] Dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la plainte contre M. Barbe est fond\u00e9e, je reverrai l\u2019entente et j\u2019ordonnerai que les dispositions potentiellement pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats soient divulgu\u00e9es.\n[55] La divulgation de toute disposition de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement \u00e0 M. Barbe est sujette aux modalit\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires suivantes :\ni) l\u2019entente ne doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e que par M. Barbe et son avocat aux fins de l\u2019audition de la plainte contre M. Barbe; et\nii) aucune copie ne doit \u00eatre faite d\u2019une quelconque disposition de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement qui est divulgu\u00e9e. Dans les 30 jours suivant la conclusion de l\u2019audience, l\u2019avocat de M. Barbe doit retourner tout document relatif \u00e0 l\u2019entente qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u \u00e0 la Commission, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[56] Il convient de noter que cette d\u00e9cision ne porte que sur la question de la production de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. C\u2019est le membre qui entendra la cause qui d\u00e9terminera en d\u00e9finitive si elle est admissible.\n[57] L\u2019avocat de Radio-Canada a demand\u00e9 que je signale aux parties qu\u2019aucune mention des modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019entente ne sera faite dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Il ne m\u2019appartient pas de prendre un engagement, au nom du membre qui entendra le fond de la cause, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce qu\u2019il choisira de dire ou de ne pas dire dans sa d\u00e9cision. En fait, il serait hautement innoportun que je le fasse. Si les parties nourrissent quelque crainte \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, elles peuvent faire part de leurs pr\u00e9occupations au membre qui entendra la cause. De m\u00eame, toute pr\u00e9occupation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la non-publication du dossier officiel de l\u2019audience devrait \u00eatre abord\u00e9e au cours de l\u2019audience.\nIII. L\u2019ADDITION DE MME DES ROSIERS EN TANT QUE PARTIE [58] La Commission a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause de cette proc\u00e9dure soit modifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ajouter Mme Des Rosiers en tant que partie. Selon la Commission, Mme Des Rosiers est la personne directement l\u00e9s\u00e9e dans cette cause, et la partie \u00e0 laquelle devraient revenir toutes les indemnisations d\u00e9coulant du redressement. La Commission affirme que l\u2019addition de Mme Des Rosiers comme plaignante \u00e9viterait toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 lors de la proc\u00e9dure, et ne r\u00e9sulterait en aucun pr\u00e9judice pour l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[59] M. Barbe s\u2019oppose \u00e0 cette demande en all\u00e9guant que Mme Des Rosiers n\u2019a plus aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l\u2019affaire.\n[60] Je pr\u00e9sume que l\u2019affirmation de M. Barbe est fond\u00e9e sur ce qu\u2019il croit \u00eatre la teneur de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement conclue entre Mme Des Rosiers et Radio-Canada. \u00c0 ce point cependant, il n\u2019y a aucune preuve devant moi donnant \u00e0 penser que Mme Des Rosiers n\u2019a plus d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l\u2019affaire.\n[61] Je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 approuver la demande de la Commission \u00e0 ce moment. Cette affaire est quelque peu inhabituelle en ce que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par une organisation au nom de la personne directement impliqu\u00e9e. Je ne dispose d\u2019aucune information sur la raison pour laquelle Mme Des Rosiers n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 plainte elle-m\u00eame en premier lieu, et je suis de ce fait incapable d\u2019\u00e9tablir s\u2019il conviendrait de lui permettre de se joindre \u00e0 l\u2019action aussi tardivement.\n[62] En pr\u00e9sentant sa demande, la Commission pr\u00e9sume \u00e9galement que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour ajouter un plaignant apr\u00e8s que l\u2019affaire a pass\u00e9 par le processus de la Commission, dans de telles circonstances.\n[63] Par cons\u00e9quent, je reporte la d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission d\u2019ajouter Mme Des Rosiers comme plaignante afin que le membre charg\u00e9 d\u2019entendre cette cause y donne suite apr\u00e8s qu\u2019un dossier de preuve plus complet aura \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9.\n_________________________________\nAnne L.

D\u00c9CISION\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente est ma deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision sur la question de l'habilit\u00e9, initialement soulev\u00e9e dans le cadre de la preuve principale de la plaignante. J'ai joint aux pr\u00e9sents motifs la d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente (annexe A). Dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision susmentionn\u00e9e, j'ai exprim\u00e9 mes r\u00e9ticences au sujet de la capacit\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et j'ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa participation \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure devait faire l'objet d'un suivi. Un certain nombre d'autres pr\u00e9occupations ont \u00e9merg\u00e9 au cours du contre-interrogatoire. J'ai par la suite autoris\u00e9 les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter de nouveau leur requ\u00eate pour obtenir que la plaignante soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inapte \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\nI. LA PLAIGNANTE EST-ELLE APTE \u00c0 T\u00c9MOIGNER? [2] La requ\u00eate initiale a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de nouveau \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d'un certain nombre d'observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es aux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes du contre-interrogatoire. Les intim\u00e9s m'ont remis des extraits de la transcription r\u00e9cente, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme pi\u00e8ce dans le voir-dire. Les avocats ont soulign\u00e9 les passages qui les pr\u00e9occupent et ont soutenu que ce serait une erreur de poursuivre la proc\u00e9dure. Ils ont affirm\u00e9, depuis le d\u00e9but de l'audience, que les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante \u00e9taient le fait d'un d\u00e9r\u00e8glement d'ordre psychologique.\n[3] J'ai joint (annexe B) certains des renvois les plus \u00e9vocateurs, ainsi qu'un extrait dans lequel la plaignante d\u00e9crit son \u00e9tat durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle aurait cens\u00e9ment fait l'objet d'un harc\u00e8lement. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve les plus troublants se rapportent au fait que la plaignante est convaincue que d'autres personnes lui ont mis des pens\u00e9es ou des phrases dans la t\u00eate. Elle croit que c'est ce qui se passait durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle aurait fait l'objet de harc\u00e8lement. Cela serait aussi arriv\u00e9 plus r\u00e9cemment. Sa pr\u00e9tention g\u00e9n\u00e9rale semble \u00eatre que des personnes ont implant\u00e9 des suggestions subliminales dans son esprit, et qu'elle est contrainte d'y ob\u00e9ir. La plaignante croit donc avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 programm\u00e9e \u00e0 agir de certaines fa\u00e7ons.\n[4] Les r\u00e9sultats de la suggestion susmentionn\u00e9e incluent des affirmations n'ayant aucun rapport \u00e9vident avec les circonstances dans lesquelles elles sont prononc\u00e9es. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir dit I see Helter Skelter [ci-apr\u00e8s Je vois P\u00eale-M\u00eale ] \u00e0 la vue du portrait d'une femme nue dans le chantier naval. Elle affirme avoir fait la d\u00e9claration susmentionn\u00e9e parce que quelqu'un, du nom de Robin, lui avait dit que c'\u00e9tait ce qu'elle dirait, des ann\u00e9es avant que la plainte ne survienne. Elle \u00e9tait aussi programm\u00e9e \u00e0 dire qu'elle avait le SIDA, lorsqu'on a constat\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait s\u00e9ro-n\u00e9gative pour le VIH, et \u00e0 dire [TRADUCTION] oink, oink, tu comprends dans des circonstances qui ne peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es que de bizarres. Cette m\u00eame personne, qu'elle appelait [TRADUCTION] Robin le pourri , lui aurait aussi dit qu'elle devait se livrer \u00e0 un \u00e9tablissement psychiatrique un jour. Ce qu'elle raconte est confus, mais se rapporte au fait qu'elle a accept\u00e9 d'aider une personne qui \u00e9tait une prostitu\u00e9e.\n[5] Le probl\u00e8me que soul\u00e8vent de tels genres de remarques d\u00e9coule de l'objet de la plainte dont je suis saisie. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 un certain moment, au moins, elle croyait que Dieu lui disait de pr\u00e9senter la plainte. Elle est \u00e9galement convaincue que le particulier intim\u00e9 l'a programm\u00e9e \u00e0 entendre certaines fr\u00e9quences et \u00e0 jouer une chanson populaire \u00e0 la guitare, sans l'avoir apprise. Certaines de ses observations pr\u00e9sentent un caract\u00e8re moins anodin. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises que l'intim\u00e9 pourrait l'avoir programm\u00e9 \u00e0 se blesser ou \u00e0 se suicider. Elle a aussi affirm\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 programm\u00e9. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle est au courant d'une telle programmation, elle dit croire \u00eatre la mieux plac\u00e9e pour le contre-interroger.\n[6] Il ne s'agit l\u00e0 que de certains des aspects les plus troublants du t\u00e9moignage. Les intim\u00e9s ont exprim\u00e9 d'autres motifs de pr\u00e9occupation. Il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu'elle pr\u00e9sente des \u00e9pisodes de dissociation ind\u00e9pendamment de ce qu'on puisse penser de son \u00e9tat psychologique. Son comportement \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins, et ailleurs, a \u00e9t\u00e9 excentrique et empreint d'\u00e9motivit\u00e9. J'ai constat\u00e9 de multiples incidents troublants, qui attestent tous de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e9prouv\u00e9e par la plaignante \u00e0 l'audience. Ma d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente sur l'habilit\u00e9 d\u00e9crit en partie ce comportement.\n[7] Les intim\u00e9s ont soutenu que la plaignante ne peut r\u00e9pondre au crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli par le juge Dubin dans l'arr\u00eat R. c. Hawke (1975) 7 O.R. (2d) 145. Le crit\u00e8re, selon la jurisprudence, semble comporter deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Un t\u00e9moin ne peut t\u00e9moigner si le tribunal est convaincu que soit\nson \u00e9tat psychologique actuel, soit son \u00e9tat psychologique au moment des faits en cause\nl'emp\u00eachent de pr\u00e9senter un t\u00e9moignage auquel un juge raisonnable des faits pourrait se fier. Il s'agit ultimement d'une question d'ordre juridique et non d'ordre psychologique. Le Tribunal est l'instance la mieux plac\u00e9e pour juger de la valeur probatoire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments devant lui. Le facteur le plus important \u00e0 prendre en compte dans une cause comme celle dont je suis saisi sera normalement la conduite du t\u00e9moin \u00e0 la barre.\n[8] J'ai autoris\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa preuve principale, malgr\u00e9 les difficult\u00e9s qu'elle \u00e9prouvait \u00e0 la barre. Une partie de sa preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on intelligible et pr\u00e9sentait une lucidit\u00e9 satisfaisante. Toutefois, plus r\u00e9cemment, une partie de son t\u00e9moignage a sembl\u00e9 d\u00e9connect\u00e9 de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. M\u00eame si la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 confronter ses perceptions avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, elle n'est pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 envisager la possibilit\u00e9 que le d\u00e9r\u00e8glement de ses perceptions que j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9crit soit le produit d'un \u00e9tat psychologique. Selon les mots des avocats, elle n'acceptera pas d'autre r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que la sienne propre.\n[9] La plaignante ne peut faire la diff\u00e9rence entre ses perceptions perturb\u00e9es et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Cette incapacit\u00e9 remonte \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode du harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Le probl\u00e8me consiste \u00e0 distinguer les parties les plus fiables de la preuve de la plaignante des parties peu fiables. Il s'agit ici exactement du type de situation, \u00e0 mon avis, o\u00f9 un juge serait contraint de d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9 d'un proc\u00e8s, si ce type de preuve devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 devant un jury. Il existe une limite au-del\u00e0 de laquelle un tribunal ne peut plus \u00e9valuer l'exactitude d'un t\u00e9moignage.\n[10] Il m'appara\u00eet que les circonstances dont je suis saisi sont plus que suffisantes pour annuler la pr\u00e9somption coutumi\u00e8re selon laquelle un t\u00e9moin est habile \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Je suis convaincu, d'apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante ne r\u00e9pond \u00e0 aucun des deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re juridique. Il serait manifestement d\u00e9raisonnable de rendre des d\u00e9cisions sur la foi de son t\u00e9moignage. Je ne suis pas d'avis qu'un juge des faits pourrait en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 s'appuyer sur la preuve qu'elle pr\u00e9sente pour conclure contre les intim\u00e9s. Il s'ensuit que le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante ne peut \u00eatre admis dans la proc\u00e9dure dont je suis saisi.\nII. LA PLAIGNANTE EST-ELLE APTE \u00c0 POURSUIVRE LA CAUSE? [11] Je crois qu'en toute justice il faut dire que la participation de la plaignante \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure est parsem\u00e9e de difficult\u00e9s. Les intim\u00e9s ont soutenu qu'elle n'a pas la capacit\u00e9 psychologique pour poursuivre la cause. Les avocats n'ont pas pu citer de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent jurisprudentiel \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 au dossier que ce type de conclusion ressemble dangereusement \u00e0 une conclusion selon laquelle une personne serait inhabile au sens juridique plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du terme. Une telle conclusion d\u00e9borde nettement le cadre de mes attributions. Je n'ai ni le pouvoir ni l'envie d'exprimer une opinion sur la question de savoir si la plaignante est habile au sens large de ce terme. Je suis cependant convaincu, malgr\u00e9 les pr\u00e9occupations que j'ai exprim\u00e9es, que je peux exercer le pouvoir auxiliaire qui consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si elle est apte \u00e0 participer \u00e0 l'audience.\n[12] Il importe en l'esp\u00e8ce d'\u00eatre prudent. Selon l'interpr\u00e9tation que j'en fais, la loi exige seulement qu'une personne qui donne des instructions \u00e0 un avocat ait une compr\u00e9hension de base des d\u00e9cisions qu'il faudra prendre dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure juridique. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait comprendre aux avocats qu'un tribunal ne peut intervenir que dans les cas les plus \u00e9vidents, lorsqu'une partie perd la capacit\u00e9 de prendre les d\u00e9cisions les plus fondamentales sur la gestion de la cause. La question de savoir si une partie est apte, ou non, \u00e0 participer \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure juridique est habituellement tranch\u00e9e en fonction de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 donner des instructions \u00e0 son avocat. Ce sont donc l'aptitude et l'\u00e9tat de la plaignante qu'il faut examiner dans un tel contexte, plut\u00f4t que la difficult\u00e9 li\u00e9e au d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure. Une personne a le droit de se repr\u00e9senter elle-m\u00eame, m\u00eame si elle ne poss\u00e8de que peu de la formation normalement requise, pour traiter des questions devant un tribunal.\n[13] La vraie difficult\u00e9 qui se pose en l'esp\u00e8ce en est une d'ordre pratique, puisque la conduite de l'instance incombe \u00e0 la plaignante. Je me rends compte que la cause dont je suis saisi serait difficile pour toute partie plaignante, particuli\u00e8rement si elle est priv\u00e9e des ressources d'un avocat. Les difficult\u00e9s de la plaignante d\u00e9passent toutefois de telles pr\u00e9occupations normales. Elle a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se ma\u00eetriser lorsque ses \u00e9motions entrent en jeu et a souvent agi de fa\u00e7on perturbatrice. Je ne suis pas d'avis qu'elle dispose des ressources affectives et psychologiques n\u00e9cessaires pour participer normalement \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure, quels que soient les accommodements que je pourrais lui accorder. \u00catre trop rigide sur de telles questions serait une erreur, mais le d\u00e9corum et l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9s. Il y va v\u00e9ritablement de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[14] Une partie ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir des avantages de la proc\u00e9dure juridique et rejeter en m\u00eame temps le pouvoir de l'instance responsable de statuer sur l'esp\u00e8ce. La plaignante a eu un comportement perturbateur et semble croire \u00e0 l'existence d'un effort concert\u00e9 en vue de la priver de ses droits. Elle n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 interrompre les avocats et \u00e0 accuser les autres parties d'abuser de la proc\u00e9dure. Lorsqu'elle s'est rendue compte que j'allais vraisemblablement statuer sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en sa d\u00e9faveur, elle a tourn\u00e9 son attention vers le Tribunal. Plut\u00f4t que de compara\u00eetre le dernier jour de l'audience, elle a adopt\u00e9 le point de vue, dans une pi\u00e8ce de correspondance adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l'agent du greffe, que le Tribunal avait entrepris de l'humilier publiquement. Une telle r\u00e9action ne peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e que comme une autre manifestation de son \u00e9tat psychologique. Bien que la plaignante manifeste souvent les caract\u00e9ristiques d'une personne normale, son comportement pr\u00e9sente un c\u00f4t\u00e9 irrationnel qui entrave constamment sa capacit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure.\n[15] Les tribunaux ont trait\u00e9, dans des affaires criminelles, de questions semblables, m\u00eame si le processus p\u00e9nal diff\u00e8re sensiblement de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Le jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'affaire R. c. Whittle [1994] 2 R.C.S. 914 traite d'une mani\u00e8re incidente de l'aptitude d'un accus\u00e9 \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s. Le jugement porte, \u00e0 la p. 933, qu'un accus\u00e9 requiert seulement une capacit\u00e9 cognitive limit\u00e9e de comprendre le processus . Bien que le seuil \u00e9tabli par ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de soit tr\u00e8s bas, il reconna\u00eet la disposition pertinente du Code criminel, qui pose la question de savoir si l'accus\u00e9 est capable d'assumer sa d\u00e9fense ou de donner des instructions \u00e0 un avocat \u00e0 cet effet. Le jugement indique qu'une partie doit pouvoir arr\u00eater un choix, et j'irais plus loin en affirmant qu'il doit s'agir d'un choix utile. Une partie dont les choix sont enti\u00e8rement arbitraires est inapte \u00e0 participer \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure juridique.\n[16] En guise de principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il semble improbable qu'une personne incapable de t\u00e9moigner parce qu'elle souffre de troubles reconnus puisse prendre le genre de d\u00e9cisions n\u00e9cessaires pour donner des instructions \u00e0 un avocat. J'affirme ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de parce qu'il suffit \u00e0 une personne qui compara\u00eet comme t\u00e9moin de pr\u00e9senter un r\u00e9cit fiable de certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Cela n'exige pas la capacit\u00e9 de prendre des d\u00e9cisions sur la conduite de la cause. Je ne saurais dire si la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Whittle tient compte de cette question. Toutefois, il me semble qu'une partie doit pouvoir comprendre, dans une certaine mesure, les cons\u00e9quences des d\u00e9cisions qu'il faut arr\u00eater dans la poursuite d'une affaire. En l'esp\u00e8ce, par exemple, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 une ordonnance qui aurait pour effet la divulgation par le tuteur public de ses dossiers en ce qui concerne une r\u00e9cente requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vue de l'interner. Elle ne semblait pas capable, cependant, de discerner le fait que sa demande pouvait mener \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements susceptibles d'aider les intim\u00e9s, soit sur la question de l'habilit\u00e9 soit sur le fond de la cause.\n[17] La plaignante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa preuve principale. Nous avons seulement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 la contre-interroger, apr\u00e8s un mois d'audience, et nous ne sommes pas m\u00eame venus pr\u00e8s d'aborder les all\u00e9gations substantielles. Je ne veux pas conjecturer des difficult\u00e9s qu'elle \u00e9prouvera lorsque les avocats entreprendront de sonder sa preuve concernant les all\u00e9gations d'ordre sexuel plut\u00f4t effrayantes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant moi. Je ne crois pas qu'il soit possible de se lancer dans une telle entreprise, cependant, et je suis d'avis que ce serait une erreur de poursuivre la proc\u00e9dure plus avant. Je ne crois pas non plus que la plaignante soit capable de contre-interroger le particulier intim\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e et je me vois contraint de dire que l'autoriser \u00e0 ce faire serait source d'un r\u00e9el danger. Je suis pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 du fait qu'elle a d'autres raisons de rechercher une telle confrontation, ces raisons ayant davantage trait \u00e0 ses obsessions psychologiques qu'\u00e0 l'objet de la proc\u00e9dure d'audience.\n[18] Dans un tel contexte, je suis convaincu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, de l'inaptitude de la plaignante \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure ou \u00e0 donner des instructions \u00e0 un avocat pour qu'il repr\u00e9sente ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Je ne crois pas qu'elle puisse prendre les d\u00e9cisions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la poursuite de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Je crains aussi que son incapacit\u00e9 de prendre des d\u00e9cisions utiles ne la pousse \u00e0 agir d'une mani\u00e8re qui lui portera un pr\u00e9judice grave et irr\u00e9parable, des points de vue juridique, affectif et psychologique. J'estime que le rapport du Dr Kaplan, introduit comme pi\u00e8ce dans le voir-dire, m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre soigneusement pris en compte dans un tel contexte.\nIII. REJET [19] Il n'y a pas moyen de poursuivre l'audience \u00e0 ce moment. Il peut cependant exister diverses fa\u00e7ons de r\u00e9gler la situation actuelle. J'ai soulev\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9, par exemple, de la nullit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. Cependant, le choix fondamental se fera entre un ajournement de l'affaire et le rejet des plaintes. En th\u00e9orie, \u00e0 tout le moins, l'affaire pourrait \u00eatre report\u00e9e ind\u00e9finiment, l'hypoth\u00e8se \u00e9tant qu'une autre audience pourra \u00eatre tenue si la plaignante devient plus tard habile \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La faisabilit\u00e9 d'un tel choix serait plus grande si les plaintes \u00e9taient r\u00e9centes.\n[20] \u00c0 mon avis, la pr\u00e9sente cause a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 trop retard\u00e9e. M\u00eame si les intim\u00e9s portent une partie de la responsabilit\u00e9 de ce retard, au moins devant le Tribunal, je suis d'avis que clore l'affaire servirait la justice. Il est temps de mettre un terme \u00e0 cette longue et douloureuse proc\u00e9dure. Je suis particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 du sort du particulier intim\u00e9, qui a d\u00fb vivre avec de telles all\u00e9gations, d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre, pendant huit ou neuf ans. Beaucoup des all\u00e9gations en cause sont extravagantes et extr\u00eamement embarrassantes. Elles comprennent des all\u00e9gations de viol et d'inconduite sexuelle avec des enfants. Les intim\u00e9s ont soutenu d'embl\u00e9e que lesdites all\u00e9gations \u00e9taient tout \u00e0 fait d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de fondement. Des enqu\u00eates ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues et je ne crois pas que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice serait servie par un retour \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause dans deux ou trois ans, uniquement pour reprendre la proc\u00e9dure. Comme la plaignante l'a elle-m\u00eame fait observer, l'esp\u00e8ce a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9puis\u00e9 des ressources publiques importantes.\n[21] L'une des plaintes dont je suis saisi concerne la pr\u00e9sence de pornographie au chantier naval. Le fait soul\u00e8ve des questions d'ordre institutionnel qui me pr\u00e9occupent. Au plan pratique, toutefois, je ne suis pas d'avis qu'il soit possible de s\u00e9parer la plainte susmentionn\u00e9e des autres plaintes. Bien que l'affaire soit moins pressante dans le cas de l'institution intim\u00e9e, il ne fait aucun doute que des affaires comme celle dont je suis saisi ne peuvent avoir qu'un effet d\u00e9moralisant sur des employ\u00e9s. Les trois plaintes ont eu une incidence sur la vie des officiers et d'employ\u00e9s particuliers, qui veulent se d\u00e9gager des all\u00e9gations de la plaignante. Dans le contexte militaire, je crois de plus que l'estime envers sa propre institution, chez l'intim\u00e9, m\u00e9rite une certaine mesure de protection. La pr\u00e9sente cause pr\u00e9sente un c\u00f4t\u00e9 scandaleux, qui va au-del\u00e0 des personnes qui ont directement \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9es par l'enqu\u00eate et l'audience.\n[22] La plaignante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'une longue audience. Toutes les occasions possibles lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et, d'une certaine fa\u00e7on, \u00e0 tout le moins, j'estime que les intim\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s dans une position p\u00e9rilleuse. Il semblerait que je sois plac\u00e9 dans le cas inverse de celui des tribunaux, lorsqu'une demande d'ajournement est rejet\u00e9e et qu'une partie est convoqu\u00e9e pour d\u00e9fendre sa cause. Si une telle partie omet de le faire, la partie adverse a droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision sur le fond. Nous sommes ici en pr\u00e9sence d'un d\u00e9faut de pr\u00e9sentation d'une preuve, suivi, du moins par d\u00e9duction, d'une demande d'ajournement. Je suis n\u00e9anmoins d'avis que le fondement logique est le m\u00eame dans les deux cas susmentionn\u00e9s. Puisqu'il serait injuste d'ajourner l'affaire, et j'ai rejet\u00e9 une telle possibilit\u00e9, je suis d'avis que les intim\u00e9s ont droit \u00e0 un rejet [des plaintes]. Le principe de la pr\u00e9clusion doit pr\u00e9valoir et doit s'appliquer dans les deux cas.\n[23] Un des bons points d'une proc\u00e9dure juridique se rapporte \u00e0 sa finalit\u00e9. Lorsqu'une plainte est fond\u00e9e ou rejet\u00e9e, la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 se trouve close. Le tribunal est dessaisi et l'affaire devient une chose jug\u00e9e. Si le tribunal a err\u00e9, les parties peuvent demander une r\u00e9vision judiciaire. Sinon, les parties doivent respecter les r\u00e9sultats. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un des avantages de toute proc\u00e9dure devant une cour ou un tribunal. Vient un temps o\u00f9 les gens doivent reprendre le cours normal de leur vie.\nIV. INTERDICTION DE PUBLIER [24] Deux autres questions doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es. La premi\u00e8re se rapporte au fait que je ne vois pas de motif contraignant de maintenir l'interdiction de publier eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Le simple fait que les all\u00e9gations aient un caract\u00e8re offensant ne justifie pas une interdiction de publier. M. Hortie peut interpr\u00e9ter le rejet de la plainte comme la cons\u00e9cration de sa position et quiconque reprend le r\u00e9cit des all\u00e9gations est tenu de respecter le fait que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Si une personne pr\u00e9sente faussement l'affaire, ou omet de respecter la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, M. Hortie et les autres disposent des recours normaux.\n[25] La population et la presse ont le droit d'examiner la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et les r\u00e9sultats de chaque cause. La libert\u00e9 d'expression exige une certaine libert\u00e9 dans les communications. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un \u00e9l\u00e9ment crucial de notre r\u00e9gime, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui ajoute au caract\u00e8re de justice de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[26] M\u00eame si la divulgation de renseignements personnels sur la plaignante me pr\u00e9occupe, cette derni\u00e8re a demand\u00e9 la lev\u00e9e de l'interdiction de publier. M\u00eame si j'ai conclu \u00e0 son inaptitude \u00e0 se repr\u00e9senter elle-m\u00eame, je me tiens tenu de prendre son point de vue en compte. Elle est fermement d'avis que la divulgation publique de la pr\u00e9sente affaire rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re important.\nV. DOSSIERS PRIV\u00c9S [27] Les intim\u00e9s sont en possession d'une grande quantit\u00e9 de renseignements personnels sur Mme Day. Ces renseignements incluent des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux et psychologiques, qui traitent de domaines d'examen qui n'entrent normalement pas dans le champ d'un examen juridique. Il y a, par exemple, le rapport du Dr Williams, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 lorsque la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 intern\u00e9e au Pavillon Eric Martin en novembre 2000, contre son gr\u00e9. Le rapport d\u00e9crit d'une mani\u00e8re consid\u00e9rablement d\u00e9taill\u00e9e l'\u00e9tat psychologique et affectif pr\u00e9caire de la plaignante \u00e0 ce moment. Les intim\u00e9s sont aussi en possession des notes r\u00e9dig\u00e9es par la plaignante dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9paration d'un long compte rendu de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. Le Dr Kaplan, le t\u00e9moin expert qui a comparu au nom des intim\u00e9s, a des documents semblables en sa possession.\n[28] Il s'agit l\u00e0 de renseignements qui seraient normalement confin\u00e9s au domaine priv\u00e9 et non divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres parties. Les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s parce que les intim\u00e9s avaient soulev\u00e9 la question de l'\u00e9tat psychologique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la plaignante dans le cadre de l'audience. Cet \u00e9tat fondait leur d\u00e9fense. La plainte a maintenant \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, toutefois, et ces questions sont maintenant \u00e9teintes. Je ne vois pas pourquoi les autres parties auraient le droit de conserver ces renseignements sans motif contraignant. Aucun tel motif n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9.\n[29] La plaignante s'oppose, et on peut le comprendre, \u00e0 ce que ces documents demeurent en possession des autres parties. \u00c0 mon avis, sa demande est raisonnable. La Cour supr\u00eame a reconnu que les demandes visant le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e ont un certain poids constitutionnel. Ces renseignements ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection que celle qui est accord\u00e9e \u00e0 nos pens\u00e9es les plus intimes. Il n'y a aucune raison pour que des tiers prennent connaissance, accidentellement ou de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e, de tels renseignements personnels une fois l'audience termin\u00e9e.\n[30] Les intim\u00e9s ont n\u00e9anmoins exprim\u00e9 leurs pr\u00e9occupations devant le fait que lesdits documents pourraient \u00eatre d\u00e9truits. Cette pr\u00e9occupation d\u00e9coule des d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures de la plaignante selon lesquelles elle avait l'intention de poursuivre le litige sur d'autres tribunes. Elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle aurait d\u00e9truit ses notes si elle avait su qu'elles allaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es. Il y a d'autres moyens de r\u00e9gler ce point, cependant. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances, je suis d'avis que la question peut \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e en remettant les documents au Tribunal, \u00e9tant entendu qu'ils seront conserv\u00e9s sous scell\u00e9. S'ils sont requis \u00e0 l'avenir, les intim\u00e9s pourront pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate devant le Tribunal pour obtenir une ordonnance de divulgation.\nVI. OBSERVATION FINALE [31] Je me rends compte que la plaignante sera d\u00e9\u00e7ue et peut-\u00eatre f\u00e2ch\u00e9e devant l'issue des pr\u00e9sentes. Elle semble se croire trahie par toute la proc\u00e9dure. Cet \u00e9tat des choses est en partie attribuable \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9rience qu'elle a v\u00e9cue \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Elle est d'avis qu'on lui a demand\u00e9 de dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, le seul r\u00e9sultat \u00e9tant qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 punie parce qu'elle a parl\u00e9 ouvertement de son v\u00e9cu psychologique. Je comprends ses sentiments \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, mais il n'y a rien que je puisse dire, si ce n'est pour la f\u00e9liciter d'avoir parl\u00e9 franchement. Le fait n'a aucune incidence sur l'issue des pr\u00e9sentes.\n[32] Toute proc\u00e9dure se heurte \u00e0 des limites et, dans certains cas, il est tout simplement impossible de proc\u00e9der. On peut cependant trouver un c\u00f4t\u00e9 positif \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente audience. M\u00eame si la proc\u00e9dure a \u00e9t\u00e9 parsem\u00e9e de difficult\u00e9s, l'aspect le plus important de la pr\u00e9sente affaire est peut-\u00eatre que la plaignante a termin\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve principale, m\u00eame si ce t\u00e9moignage a, en bout de ligne, \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inadmissible. La perfection n'est pas de ce monde, mais d'une certaine mani\u00e8re, la plaignante a v\u00e9ritablement eu la possibilit\u00e9 de se faire entendre. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un fait suffisamment important pour justifier la tenue de la proc\u00e9dure. Outre cela, je ne puis rien ajouter.\nVII. D\u00c9CISION [33] Je suis convaincu que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la plaignante est inapte \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Je suis aussi convaincu qu'elle est inapte \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions utiles sur la conduite et le d\u00e9roulement de sa cause. Elle est incapable de participer \u00e0 l'audience. Je tiens \u00e0 ce que le dossier public fasse clairement mention du fait que je suis d'avis que son bien-\u00eatre serait gravement menac\u00e9 par la poursuite de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[34] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances, je suis convaincu que la plaignante a eu amplement la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa cause, dans toute la mesure du possible. Aucun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve mis \u00e0 ma disposition ne fonde ses all\u00e9gations et les plaintes sont rejet\u00e9es.\n[35] L'interdiction de publier est par la pr\u00e9sente lev\u00e9e. Les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux et psychologiques concernant la plaignante, ainsi que les notes personnelles en cause, pourront \u00eatre conserv\u00e9s pendant six mois \u00e0 compter de la date d'expiration de toute p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9vision ou d'appel subs\u00e9quent. Cela devrait plus que suffire aux fins de l'examen des dossiers. Si les intim\u00e9s veulent transmettre au Tribunal une copie des pi\u00e8ces pertinentes, elles seront gard\u00e9es sous scell\u00e9. Les autres copies en possession des intim\u00e9s devront \u00eatre d\u00e9truites. J'aimerais recevoir une lettre des avocats, laquelle confirmera que chacun des intim\u00e9s s'est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente consigne. Je garderai la comp\u00e9tence de modifier ce volet de mon ordonnance, selon l'\u00e9volution des circonstances.\n\u00ab Originale sign\u00e9e par \u00bb\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 4 avril 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS DU TRIBUNAL Nos : T627\/1501 et T628\/1601\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Amanda Day c.

LA REQU\u00caTE DONT JE SUIS SAISI [1] Les paragraphes suivants \u00e9noncent mes motifs de d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate des intim\u00e9s visant \u00e0 obtenir une d\u00e9cision ayant pour effet de d\u00e9clarer que l'intim\u00e9e est inhabile \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, plut\u00f4t, formuler la question en termes de capacit\u00e9 et \u00e9viter les associations p\u00e9joratives avec le mot en usage dans la jurisprudence. Une deuxi\u00e8me question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans ce contexte, la question de savoir si la plaignante a la capacit\u00e9 de se repr\u00e9senter elle-m\u00eame. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, je ne crois pas qu'il serait dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties d'interrompre la proc\u00e9dure pour r\u00e9diger des motifs \u00e9labor\u00e9s. Toutefois, je me sens tenu de rendre des motifs \u00e9crits avant de poursuivre la proc\u00e9dure.\n[2] Avant de traiter du contexte de la requ\u00eate, je ferai observer que la deuxi\u00e8me question pourrait sembler exiger un degr\u00e9 plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de capacit\u00e9, puisqu'une partie qui est habile \u00e0 poursuivre une proc\u00e9dure doit \u00eatre capable de participer \u00e0 son d\u00e9roulement. Cela semblerait normalement exiger l'atteinte d'une norme plus rigoureuse que la simple capacit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des t\u00e9moignages probants, \u00e0 savoir une capacit\u00e9 simplement suffisante pour aider le juge des faits. La logique habituelle des circonstances semble toutefois invers\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances dont je suis saisi. Cette inversion d\u00e9coule du fait que la principale difficult\u00e9 de la plaignante, comme l'a soutenu Mme Thayer, r\u00e9side dans le r\u00e9cit des all\u00e9gations sexuelles qui sont au c\u009cur de la plainte. Il s'agit l\u00e0 sans nul doute de l'aspect le plus difficile de l'affaire, d'un point de vue juridique.\n[3] Bien que j'aie plus directement cibl\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re question, qui concerne l'aptitude de la plaignante \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, les faits sont qu'il existe une pr\u00e9occupation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale quant \u00e0 son \u00e9tat psychologique, ladite pr\u00e9occupation s'\u00e9tendant \u00e0 tous les aspects de la cause. Je veux rassurer la plaignante et lui faire savoir qu'\u00e0 mon avis, les autres parties ont agi en vue de pr\u00e9server l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure et d'une mani\u00e8re qui tenait hautement compte du bien-\u00eatre de la plaignante. Il n'y a rien d'irr\u00e9gulier dans la requ\u00eate dont je suis saisi : au contraire, je crois qu'il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 de poursuivre sans examiner les questions qu'elle soul\u00e8ve. Cela demeure vrai, quelle que soit ma d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate.\nII. CONTEXTE G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL DE LA CAUSE [4] Il convient que je pr\u00e9cise d'abord que les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de la pr\u00e9sente affaire semblent parsem\u00e9s de complications. Il est impossible d'ignorer que les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents psychologiques de la plaignante sont pertinents \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Le dossier m\u00e9dical, qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 av\u00e9r\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante, r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 intern\u00e9e. Cela ne sert \u00e0 rien de cacher le fait : il ne porte pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 cons\u00e9quence dans les circonstances pr\u00e9sentes de la plaignante et, pour autant que je sache, les avocats ne laissent pas entendre qu'elle est inhabile au sens juridique large de ce terme. Ce point sert simplement \u00e0 poser le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et \u00e0 illustrer, avec le reste du dossier m\u00e9dical et psychologique, qu'il existe des motifs de pr\u00e9occupation.\n[5] Bien que je n'aie pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant des faits qui peuvent avoir transpir\u00e9 avant l'audience, la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que la Commission des droits de la personne et les autres parties ont tent\u00e9 d'obtenir une ordonnance qui aurait eu pour effet de la d\u00e9clarer inhabile. Je n'exag\u00e8re pas en disant qu'elle a l'impression qu'il y a un genre de conspiration en vue de l'interner. Je ne connais pas tous les d\u00e9tails de cette histoire, mais le dossier du Tribunal contient suffisamment d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui portent \u00e0 croire que les doutes de la plaignante ne sont pas d\u00e9nu\u00e9s de fondement. Ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de ne se veut pas une critique : la pr\u00e9sente affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile pour toutes les personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es et je me sens simplement tenu d'\u00e9tablir les circonstances globales dans lesquelles s'inscrit la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[6] La plaignante a in\u00e9vitablement l'impression que tous les efforts pass\u00e9s visant \u00e0 ce qu'elle soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inhabile \u00e9taient simplement un moyen commode de mettre fin \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instruction. Il s'ensuit qu'elle trouve extr\u00eamement suspecte la pr\u00e9sente tentative des autres parties de mettre en doute sa capacit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 l'audience. Elle est d'avis qu'il est profitable pour son bien-\u00eatre psychologique de continuer et il existe au moins une preuve d'ordre m\u00e9dical qui corrobore une telle pr\u00e9tention. Il en d\u00e9coule des questions qui d\u00e9passent le champ de ma comp\u00e9tence, toutefois, et la position juridique de la plaignante est qu'elle a le droit de poursuivre. Ce droit inclut le droit de t\u00e9moigner et de pr\u00e9senter sa version des faits. Je l'ai avertie qu'elle serait assujettie \u00e0 un contre-interrogatoire complet, visant \u00e0 approfondir les faits, qui allait sans nul doute remuer des souvenirs douloureux et \u00eatre difficile au plan affectif. Cela ne l'a pas dissuad\u00e9e.\nIII. CONTEXTE DE LA PR\u00c9SENTE REQU\u00caTE [7] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate a certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e selon les r\u00e8gles et d'une mani\u00e8re responsable. La plaignante a affich\u00e9 un comportement excentrique lorsqu'elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa preuve principale. Cette pr\u00e9sentation a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des contorsions faciales, des pauses non indiqu\u00e9es, de forts hochements de t\u00eate, elle a lev\u00e9 les bras et affich\u00e9 diverses attitudes corporelles, le tout s'\u00e9cartant de la pr\u00e9sentation normale d'une preuve de vive voix. Je mentionne les attributs susmentionn\u00e9s de son t\u00e9moignage puisqu'ils ne ressortent pas au vu du dossier. La plaignante a aussi prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des jurons, a parfois commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 sangloter, a parfois lev\u00e9 le ton ou adopt\u00e9 un ton moqueur ou \u00e9voquant des effets de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, et n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de poursuivre \u00e0 un certain nombre de reprises. L'aspect de sa preuve qui soul\u00e8ve le plus de difficult\u00e9, du point de vue de la gestion de la cause, se rapporte au fait qu'elle a trouv\u00e9 difficile, et m\u00eame impossible, de s'en tenir \u00e0 une narration des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Elle a sans cesse bifurqu\u00e9 sur d'autres questions, parfois d'une mani\u00e8re qui aurait sembl\u00e9 \u00e9trange et m\u00eame bizarre pour quiconque a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 le sens de la pertinence.\n[8] J'admets, comme les avocats l'ont soutenu, que le comportement de la plaignante s'est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9 au fil de la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve et a en bout de ligne culmin\u00e9 dans ce que je d\u00e9cris au dossier comme un acc\u00e8s de hurlements , qui est survenu lorsqu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de d\u00e9crire un des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Selon moi, le qualificatif informes est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9crire ces hurlements : ils ne v\u00e9hiculaient aucun mot, \u00e0 ma connaissance, et pour quelqu'un qui n'est pas un expert, du moins, la plaignante pleurait \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re d'un enfant, un enfant inconsolable. L'agente du greffe a imm\u00e9diatement fait un appel \u00e0 l'ordre et j'ai quitt\u00e9 la salle d'audience, bien que selon toute \u00e9vidence, elle se soit \u00e9croul\u00e9e sur le plancher, se tordant dans des convulsions , selon les dires des avocats et y restant jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les personnes pr\u00e9sentes aient quitt\u00e9 la salle. Le Dr Kaplan, un psychologue t\u00e9moignant au nom des intim\u00e9s, a conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agente du greffe d'appeler le 911, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Il ne faut pas interpr\u00e9ter ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de comme une observation sur la nature de ce qui est arriv\u00e9, et qui est devenu source de controverse entre les parties.\n[9] Un des agents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, Mme Dennis, est demeur\u00e9e dans la salle d'audience et a plus tard t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage pond\u00e9r\u00e9 et des preuves prudentes, et j'accueille son expos\u00e9 sur ce qui s'est alors pass\u00e9. Le seul point que je me sens tenu de clarifier est le fait que l'audience n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reprise en l'absence de la plaignante. Cette possibilit\u00e9 n'est jamais entr\u00e9e en ligne de compte, bien que les choses auraient pu se passer diff\u00e9remment si Mme Day avait \u00e9t\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9e. Selon moi, l'affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e en conformit\u00e9 avec un degr\u00e9 convenable de souci pour le bien-\u00eatre de la plaignante et pour la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server le bien-fond\u00e9 de l'instance. Une fois la plaignante r\u00e9tablie, l'audience a repris bri\u00e8vement, et la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle souhaitait poursuivre la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve. Les autres parties, on peut le comprendre, ont demand\u00e9 une suspension d'audience. La plaignante est devenue visiblement en col\u00e8re en r\u00e9action aux observations des avocats, et j'ai cru qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de suspendre l'audience jusqu'au lendemain, le jour o\u00f9 les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[10] Je veux \u00eatre juste. En un certain sens, toute cette affaire se trouve ainsi plac\u00e9e sous son plus mauvais jour. Je veux exprimer clairement que la plaignante est une personne intelligente qui parle souvent d'une mani\u00e8re lucide et qui per\u00e7oit v\u00e9ritablement la nature et l'objet de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage coh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l'appui des plaintes. Un des aspects du probl\u00e8me est qu'elle ne conna\u00eet pas bien les coutumes propres aux instances juridiques formelles et, comme beaucoup de gens ordinaires, qu'elle n'est pas capable d'\u00e9tablir la diff\u00e9rence entre un cadre formel et un cadre informel. De ce fait, sa fa\u00e7on d'agir et de parler est souvent inopportune. Elle n'est pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, ce qui a ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 ses difficult\u00e9s, et elle semble souvent d\u00e9pass\u00e9e par les menus d\u00e9tails propres \u00e0 la preuve. Cela dit, et compte tenu de son peu de connaissances des proc\u00e9dures juridiques, de sa fragilit\u00e9 psychologique, et de ses multiples interruptions, elle semble comprendre le processus et \u00eatre capable grossi\u00e8rement de mener sa d\u00e9fense et de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve. Il ne fait aucun doute que sa pr\u00e9sentation a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment tax\u00e9 la patience des avocats, et la mienne, mais c'est l\u00e0 une autre question, qui concerne davantage la question des accommodements.\n[11] Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate, j'ai commenc\u00e9 le voir-dire en vue de d\u00e9cider de la question de l'habilit\u00e9. Les intim\u00e9s ont convoqu\u00e9 le Dr Kaplan, psychologue clinicien, qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent au cours de l'audience. Le Dr Kaplan a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu en qualit\u00e9 d'expert et a exprim\u00e9 de s\u00e9rieuses r\u00e9serves relativement \u00e0 la poursuite de l'instance. Il a dit \u00eatre d'avis que la plaignante souffrait de troubles de la personnalit\u00e9 du type parano\u00efde, ce qui, de fa\u00e7on inh\u00e9rente, privait de fiabilit\u00e9 sa perception des faits. Il a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 son avis, la plaignante \u00e9tait entr\u00e9e dans un \u00e9tat de psychose durant son t\u00e9moignage. Le Dr Kaplan a aussi pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un rapport \u00e9crit, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ce dans le voir-dire. Mme Thayer s'est consid\u00e9rablement appuy\u00e9e sur le point de vue du Dr Kaplan selon lequel la plaignante \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat psychotique au moment du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Les causes portent \u00e0 croire qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un important facteur \u00e0 prendre en compte, mais ce facteur se rapporte au bien-fond\u00e9 de la cause, et la preuve est loin d'\u00eatre claire \u00e0 ce moment.\n[12] La plaignante a convoqu\u00e9 Mme Dennis en r\u00e9ponse, ainsi que deux experts, d\u00fbment reconnus \u00e0 ce titre par le Tribunal. Sa th\u00e9rapeute a aussi comparu \u00e0 l'audience, bien qu'elle n'ait pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le Dr Hunter, un m\u00e9decin ayant des connaissances expertes sur les troubles de stress post-traumatique, porte, pour l'essentiel, que le comportement de Mme Day \u00e9tait coh\u00e9rent avec un tel diagnostic. L'autre t\u00e9moin expert, le Dr Malcolm, un psychologue clinicien, a repris en grande partie la m\u00eame position. Le Dr Malcolm a trait\u00e9 la plaignante par le pass\u00e9 et cette derni\u00e8re l'a consult\u00e9 avant le d\u00e9but de l'instance. M. Houston a fait vigoureusement opposition \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le fait que le Dr Hunter et le Dr Malcolm \u00e9taient d'avis qu'il serait injuste de priver la plaignante de son droit de poursuivre. Ces avis \u00e9taient le fait de bonnes intentions et refl\u00e9taient l'opinion de ces personnes selon laquelle il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, au plan psychologique, que la plaignante poursuive la proc\u00e9dure. La question de justice rel\u00e8ve enti\u00e8rement du Tribunal, toutefois, et d\u00e9borde nettement la port\u00e9e d'application d'une preuve d'expert.\n[13] Les intim\u00e9s ont aussi contest\u00e9 la fiabilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages du Dr Hunter et du Dr Malcolm, au motif que ces derniers ne connaissaient pas bien les circonstances de la cause dont je suis saisi. Ils ont aussi soutenu, et on peut le comprendre, que le Dr Kaplan \u00e9tait mieux plac\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9senter une opinion \u00e9clair\u00e9e sur le comportement de la plaignante \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Je suis d'avis que les observations susmentionn\u00e9es ne sont pas d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de fondement ce qui pourrait avoir une incidence sur l'importance \u00e0 accorder aux t\u00e9moignages, mais ne la r\u00e9fute pas. \u00c0 mon avis, il importe, dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, de reconna\u00eetre qu'il incombe aux intim\u00e9s de me convaincre de l'incapacit\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. La plaignante n'est pas tenue de prouver des affirmations positives de fait. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu'elle a invoqu\u00e9s dans le cadre du voir-dire ne l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 que pour pallier la preuve des intim\u00e9s et les experts n'ont pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le but de d\u00e9montrer son habilit\u00e9.\n[14] Il me reste \u00e0 statuer sur un d\u00e9saccord entre les experts quant \u00e0 la nature exacte de la situation dont je suis saisi. Je ne propose pas d'entrer dans le d\u00e9tail de ce d\u00e9saccord, m\u00eame s'il existe un litige plus sp\u00e9cifique quant \u00e0 ce qui est arriv\u00e9 lorsqu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 hurler. Le Dr Kaplan a exprim\u00e9 l'avis que la plaignante \u00e9tait entr\u00e9e dans un \u00e9tat de rapide d\u00e9compensation . Cette terminologie a fait l'objet d'une certaine discussion. Les experts, par ailleurs, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 davantage enclins \u00e0 croire qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie d'un brusque rappel d'images ou d'une abr\u00e9action , qui lui a fait revivre les circonstances traumatiques en cause. On a aussi laiss\u00e9 entendre qu'elle avait v\u00e9cu un \u00e9pisode de dissociation. Je n'entends pas trancher le litige : quel que soit le point de vue retenu, il est \u00e9vident que la plaignante ne fonctionnait pas d'une mani\u00e8re rationnelle durant cet \u00e9pisode.\n[15] Je ne peux pas non plus arr\u00eater de diagnostic m\u00e9dical ou psychologique, mais il y a, \u00e0 de nombreux \u00e9gards, motif de croire qu'elle souffre de parano\u00efa en un certain sens g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Le Dr Hunter et le Dr Malcolm m'ont inform\u00e9 qu'il pourrait s'agir l\u00e0 d'une manifestation d'hyper-vigilance associ\u00e9e \u00e0 un trouble de stress post-traumatique. J'admets qu'elle est susceptible de dissocier \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins et risque de perdre contact avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Elle ne fait pas confiance aux avocats, \u00e9prouve de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser ses \u00e9motions et perd souvent le fil de ses id\u00e9es \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Un tel \u00e9tat des choses doit en partie \u00eatre imputable au fait que les all\u00e9gations dont je suis saisi pr\u00e9sentent un caract\u00e8re extr\u00eamement personnel et se r\u00e9v\u00e9leraient p\u00e9nibles quelle que soit la partie au litige. Le Dr Hunter a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Day pr\u00e9sentait une vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 sous-jacente qui rendrait une telle exp\u00e9rience encore plus \u00e9prouvante pour toute personne plac\u00e9e dans sa situation. Tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de pose un d\u00e9fi en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la conduite de l'instruction.\nIV. FONDEMENT JURIDIQUE DE LA REQU\u00caTE [16] Il ressort de la jurisprudence qu'il incombe au juge de statuer sur la question de savoir si un t\u00e9moin est apte \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Il incombe au jury de peser les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Voir : R. Harbuz [1979] 2 W.W.R. 105 et Steinberg v. The King (1931) 56 C.C.C. 9 (C.S.C.). La question doit donc \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e le plus t\u00f4t possible, pour \u00e9viter la possibilit\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. Il s'agit l\u00e0 de questions qui ne se posent pas en l'esp\u00e8ce. La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet, toutefois, que la question peut \u00eatre examin\u00e9e plus tard, si des pr\u00e9occupations pertinentes \u00e9mergent dans le cadre du t\u00e9moignage d'un t\u00e9moin.\n[17] Le droit op\u00e8re selon la pr\u00e9somption qu'un t\u00e9moin est apte \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. T\u00e9moigner n'exige pas d'aptitudes sup\u00e9rieures. La m\u00eame observation peut s'appliquer \u00e0 la question de savoir si une partie est capable de d\u00e9fendre sa cause, ce qui exige seulement la capacit\u00e9 de prendre des d\u00e9cisions personnelles de base. Les intim\u00e9s ont admis qu'ils avaient l'obligation de d\u00e9montrer, probablement selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, l'inaptitude de la plaignante \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Ils invoquent principalement l'affaire R. c. Hawke (1975) 7 O.R. (2d) 145 (C.A. Ont.), qui \u00e9claire sur cette question en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Ils ont aussi invoqu\u00e9 The Law of Evidence in Canada, de Sopinka, (2e \u00e9d.), 13.10 et s., qui donne un tr\u00e8s bref compte rendu du droit.\n[18] La Cour, dans l'arr\u00eat Hawke, reprend les termes antiques et aujourd'hui troublants de Wigmore, au paragraphe 492, et conclut qu'un t\u00e9moin ne peut \u00eatre priv\u00e9 de l'exercice du droit de t\u00e9moigner que si la d\u00e9ficience ou le trouble sont tels qu'ils affectent la fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage sur un point pr\u00e9cis . Le fait que la plaignante puisse souffrir d'un trouble psychologique ou d'un trouble de personnalit\u00e9 de type parano\u00efde, ou pourrait souffrir d'un trouble de stress post-traumatique, ne l'emp\u00eache pas de t\u00e9moigner. Je ne sais pas si la jurisprudence \u00e9nonce un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, mais la question est celle de savoir si un juge des faits peut convenablement et d'une mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre examiner la preuve, pour arriver \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision concernant les faits. L'emploi du mot fiable pr\u00eate facilement \u00e0 une fausse interpr\u00e9tation et la question n'est pas de savoir s'il faut ajouter foi \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage. La question est celle de savoir s'il est possible d'ajouter foi \u00e0 un tel t\u00e9moignage.\n[19] Je me sens tenu d'ajouter que mon premier devoir est de prot\u00e9ger l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure juridique. Bien que certains t\u00e9moins puissent parfois s'effondrer, au plan affectif, un certain degr\u00e9 de probit\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la tenue d'une audience juste. La proc\u00e9dure juridique et les r\u00e8gles de la preuve supposent une appr\u00e9ciation relativement calme et froide des faits dans une affaire donn\u00e9e, et l'objet de l'audience doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9. J'ai l'obligation fondamentale de maintenir le niveau n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9corum \u00e0 l'audience pour maintenir l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un attribut indispensable du r\u00e9gime juridique, un attribut qui garantit la justice et l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[20] Le juge des faits doit aussi pouvoir suivre et \u00e9valuer les t\u00e9moignages. Il doit \u00eatre possible de les examiner d'une mani\u00e8re intelligente. La preuve doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re qui pr\u00e9sente une certaine logique et une certaine coh\u00e9rence, et il doit \u00eatre possible de l'interpr\u00e9ter rationnellement. D'autres pr\u00e9occupations peuvent pr\u00e9valoir dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, relativement \u00e0 l'obligation qu'a un tribunal d'intervenir lorsque le d\u00e9roulement d'une instance menace le bien-\u00eatre psychologique de la partie plaignante. Cela se rapporte directement \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 qu'a la plaignante de pr\u00e9senter sa d\u00e9fense, toutefois, et il s'agit d'une pr\u00e9occupation qui vient au deuxi\u00e8me plan.\nV. L'APTITUDE \u00c0 T\u00c9MOIGNER DE LA PLAIGNANTE [21] Les parties ont fait un grand effort pour s'acquitter du fardeau qui leur incombait d'\u00e9tablir l'inaptitude de la plaignante \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. J'ai beaucoup de r\u00e9serves en ce qui concerne la poursuite de l'instance, ainsi que des doutes sur la capacit\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 participer \u00e0 l'audience d'une mani\u00e8re sens\u00e9e et \u00e9clair\u00e9e. Je suis particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 en ce qui concerne sa capacit\u00e9 de composer avec les \u00e9l\u00e9ments rigoureux d'un contre-interrogatoire, auquel il faudra faire face. J'ai accord\u00e9 une latitude consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 la plaignante dans la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve principale, mais les intim\u00e9s ont droit de la confronter aux d\u00e9tails de l'affaire en contre-interrogatoire et je ne vois pas comment lui \u00e9viter un tel exercice.\n[22] Mme Thayer a soutenu que Mme Day a fait preuve d'un manque de compr\u00e9hension de l'instance et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des expos\u00e9s de fait inexacts depuis le d\u00e9but de l'audience. Elle a donn\u00e9 des exemples clairs, \u00e0 son avis, de pens\u00e9e d\u00e9lirante. Il ne fait aucun doute que la capacit\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 se souvenir pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment des faits et \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question. Mme Thayer a soutenu que deux grandes questions ont, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, enclench\u00e9 un comportement inad\u00e9quat et des ruptures avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. La premi\u00e8re concerne le harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la plaignante. La deuxi\u00e8me concerne son bien-\u00eatre mental. Les intim\u00e9s admettent que Mme Day peut pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve exacts et m\u00eame probants. Mais cette capacit\u00e9 se d\u00e9grade rapidement lorsqu'elle doit traiter de faits qui sont au c\u009cur de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Il s'ensuit que sa preuve perd sa fiabilit\u00e9 lorsqu'elle traite des all\u00e9gations de faits essentielles.\n[23] Je partage les pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es par les avocats. Il est manifeste que l'effondrement pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clench\u00e9 par le r\u00e9cit des d\u00e9tails de ses all\u00e9gations. Malgr\u00e9 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre fin au t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 ce moment. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu'elle ne pouvait pas pr\u00e9senter un r\u00e9cit utile des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont men\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t des plaintes. Une des caract\u00e9ristiques de l'esp\u00e8ce est que ce sont les exigences de la proc\u00e9dure qui ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 les conditions qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effondrement de la plaignante. La situation n'est pas statique et la v\u00e9ritable pr\u00e9occupation se rapporte au fait que la proc\u00e9dure de t\u00e9moignage pourrait pr\u00e9cipiter un effondrement plus grave et plus prolong\u00e9. Je me rends compte que la situation met la plaignante en p\u00e9ril et que les avocats n'entrevoient pas avec joie la possibilit\u00e9 qu'elle puisse conna\u00eetre un \u00e9pisode encore plus grave \u00e0 cause de la tension que susciterait leur interrogatoire. Cette question rel\u00e8ve toutefois de la conjecture et je ne suis pas convaincu d'avoir atteint le seuil o\u00f9 je pourrais conclure qu'elle est incapable de t\u00e9moigner.\n[24] La question de capacit\u00e9 n'est soulev\u00e9e que lorsqu'il y a d\u00e9ficience fondamentale des capacit\u00e9s cognitives du t\u00e9moin. Le t\u00e9moignage psychiatrique dans Hawke, par exemple, \u00e9tablissait que la t\u00e9moin en cause hallucinait \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Elle \u00e9tait aussi accompagn\u00e9e, dans son esprit, par une petite fille nomm\u00e9e Delores. Sa compagne \u00e9tait, aux dires de la t\u00e9moin, \u00e0 la p. 160, supra, [TRADUCTION] dans ma t\u00eate me disant des choses qui allaient me faire emprisonner et lib\u00e9rer Tommy . Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve mis \u00e0 ma disposition indiquent que la plaignante dans la pr\u00e9sente cause a au moins manifest\u00e9 des \u00e9pisodes de dissociation \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins et qu'elle est peut-\u00eatre parfois en contact avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et parfois non. Certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrent qu'elle a connu des \u00e9pisodes de psychose par le pass\u00e9. Les seuils atteints dans la situation devant moi n'atteignent cependant en rien de telles proportions.\n[25] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, les intim\u00e9s ont aussi soutenu que l'\u00e9tat psychologique de la plaignante au moment o\u00f9 elle aurait cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e la rendait inapte \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve satisfaisant la norme n\u00e9cessaire aux r\u00e8gles de la preuve. Cette observation est toutefois pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e et s'appuie sur divers facteurs, comme le diagnostic de son \u00e9tat. M\u00eame si le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante comporte beaucoup d'imperfections, les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9tabli le fondement probatoire qui ferait valoir une telle conclusion. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Dr Kaplan a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par les autres t\u00e9moins du volet psychologique et peut, \u00e0 tout le moins, faire l'objet d'un d\u00e9bat. Il peut exister des motifs de pr\u00e9occupation sur cet aspect du t\u00e9moignage, mais la pr\u00e9occupation la plus imm\u00e9diate se rapporte \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat actuel de la plaignante.\n[26] Il est devenu manifeste durant le voir-dire que les experts ont une opinion diff\u00e9rente du bien-fond\u00e9 de la cause. Les experts qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en faveur de Mme Day semblent croire qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e sexuellement et que c'est le harc\u00e8lement sexuel qui a donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 l'\u00e9pisode traumatique associ\u00e9 au trouble de stress post-traumatique diagnostiqu\u00e9 par ses experts. La partie adverse adopte cependant une position tout autant rigide : elle avance que Mme Day a souffert d'un trouble de personnalit\u00e9 parano\u00efaque et a uniquement cru qu'elle faisait l'objet de harc\u00e8lement. Ses perceptions n'auraient eu aucun rapport avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00e0 leur avis, et auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 le produit d'un trouble psychologique. Si ce dernier point de vue est retenu, et le crit\u00e8re des cours appliqu\u00e9, la preuve qu'elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re inh\u00e9rent tellement peu fiable qu'il serait dangereux de la pr\u00e9senter devant un jury. La difficult\u00e9 r\u00e9side dans le fait qu'un tel \u00e9tat des choses m'appelle \u00e0 statuer sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la cause, en d\u00e9cidant des questions d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant moi dans le voir-dire.\n[27] M\u00eame si je ne crois pas que nous en sommes d\u00e9j\u00e0 au point o\u00f9 je pourrais intervenir, je suis d'avis que la situation actuelle doit \u00eatre suivie. Si le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante continue de se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer, ou s'il devient impossible de tenir une audience comme telle, il faudra peut-\u00eatre revenir \u00e0 la question de la capacit\u00e9.\nVI. L'APTITUDE DE LA PLAIGNANTE \u00c0 PR\u00c9SENTER SA CAUSE [28] Je n'ai pas pu passer les textes juridiques en revue eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la question de savoir si la plaignante est capable de se repr\u00e9senter elle-m\u00eame. Le crit\u00e8re pourrait \u00eatre celui de savoir si elle est capable de donner des instructions \u00e0 un avocat. Cette question n'est cependant pas pr\u00e9sentement d\u00e9terminante et je veux simplement traiter des pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par les intim\u00e9s relativement au bien-\u00eatre de la plaignante. Les experts qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans le cadre du voir-dire ne sont pas d'accord sur l'effet \u00e0 long terme de la participation de Mme Day \u00e0 l'audience. Le Dr Hunter et le Dr Malcolm ont dit croire qu'il \u00e9tait essentiel, au plan psychologique, que Mme Day ait la possibilit\u00e9 de mener cette affaire jusqu'\u00e0 sa conclusion logique. Cela pourrait \u00eatre accessoire quant \u00e0 l'objet d'une audience. N\u00e9anmoins, je crois que Mme Day a le droit fondamental de pr\u00e9senter sa cause et que l'effet th\u00e9rapeutique d'une telle pr\u00e9sentation est un facteur valide, dans l'examen des droits d'une plaignante.\n[29] Je ne suis pas autant convaincu que le Dr Hunter et le Dr Malcolm le sont des avantages qui d\u00e9couleraient de la participation de la plaignante \u00e0 l'audience, et je partage certaines des pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es par le Dr Kaplan. Je ne crois cependant pas qu'il serait indiqu\u00e9 d'intervenir dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la plaignante sauf si nous atteignons le point o\u00f9 elle deviendrait inhabile au sens large de ce terme et ne pouvait d\u00e9cider pour elle-m\u00eame. Jusque l\u00e0, la plaignante est la seule qui peut d\u00e9cider de ce qui sert le mieux ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Elle peut faire des choix qui vont manifestement contre ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Mais cela est vrai de tout citoyen et ce serait tout \u00e0 fait une erreur, \u00e0 mon avis, de la traiter comme une personne d\u00e9pendante. Il s'agit l\u00e0 directement de la question juridique de dignit\u00e9, qui exige que les tribunaux et les cours autorisent les parties \u00e0 un litige \u00e0 prendre leurs propres d\u00e9cisions, et m\u00eame les plus d\u00e9concertantes.\n[30] Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une question de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Quand j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Day si elle \u00e9tait capable de poursuivre, elle a r\u00e9pondu sans \u00e9quivoque. Elle croit qu'elle peut continuer et m'a inform\u00e9 qu'elle sait comment demander de l'aide. Pour autant que je puisse le d\u00e9terminer, elle comprend ses obligations en tant que t\u00e9moin, est capable de communiquer ses pens\u00e9es et, d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, maintient son rapport avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Elle reconna\u00eet aussi le besoin d'\u00e9valuer si ses perceptions sont exactes et bien fond\u00e9es. Elle convient, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 mes questions, qu'elle ne devrait pas jurer dans la salle d'audience et qu'elle est tenue de respecter les autres participants \u00e0 l'audience. La question de savoir si elle pourra se conformer \u00e0 une telle exigence est une autre question.\n[31] La plaignante est une partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure et conclure \u00e0 son incapacit\u00e9 la privera probablement de son droit de saisir le Tribunal de la plainte. Pour le moment, \u00e0 tout le moins, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 la priver de cette possibilit\u00e9. Le droit international sur les droits de la personne est fond\u00e9 sur la dignit\u00e9 de la personne, qui oblige un tribunal \u00e0 respecter l'autonomie personnelle des parties qui se pr\u00e9sentent devant lui. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un aspect fondamental de l'\u00eatre en tant que personne, un aspect qui garantit nos libert\u00e9s. Poursuivre pr\u00e9sente des dangers et, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, il pourra devenir n\u00e9cessaire d'intervenir. Cependant, pr\u00e9sentement, c'est \u00e0 la plaignante qu'il revient ultimement de d\u00e9cider si elle veut poursuivre. Nous n'avons pas encore atteint le point o\u00f9 je pourrais faire obstacle \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision.\nVII. D\u00c9CISION [32] Je suis par cons\u00e9quent d'avis que la plaignante est capable de t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 ce moment et qu'elle peut se repr\u00e9senter elle-m\u00eame. N\u00e9anmoins, j'entretiens de r\u00e9elles pr\u00e9occupations eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la question de savoir si elle pourra mener sa cause \u00e0 terme. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances, je crois qu'il est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 de statuer sur la requ\u00eate. Il me semble mieux indiqu\u00e9 de mettre fin au voir-dire et de reprendre l'audience, sous r\u00e9serve qu'il soit clairement entendu que la question pourra \u00eatre ouverte de nouveau sur requ\u00eate des parties.\n[33] Mon interpr\u00e9tation du droit, dans son \u00e9tat actuel, porte \u00e0 conclure que la preuve aff\u00e9rente au voir-dire pourrait \u00eatre pertinente aux questions comme celle de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et devrait s'appliquer \u00e0 l'ensemble de l'audience. Cependant, j'invite les observations des parties \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Par ailleurs, il faudra aussi examiner la question des accommodements possibles.\n\u00ab Originale sign\u00e9e par \u00bb\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 12 mars 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS DU TRIBUNAL Nos : T627\/1501 et T628\/1601\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Amanda Day c.

Je peux peut-\u00eatre vous aider un peu.\nAvez-vous trouv\u00e9 cette exp\u00e9rience effrayante?\nR : Non, je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 cela effrayant du tout. C'\u00e9tait -- une exp\u00e9rience tr\u00e8s plaisante et calme. C'est simplement que la personne -- c'est la nature des questions qui entourent le -- c'est la nature des questions qui \u00e9taient discut\u00e9es au sujet de ce genre d'hypnose avec l'autre personne qui m'inqui\u00e8te un peu.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : J'aimerais en savoir davantage \u00e0 ce sujet. Vous n'avez pas besoin d'aller beaucoup dans le d\u00e9tail, mais donnez-moi simplement une id\u00e9e de ce qu'\u00e9tait la nature de ces questions discut\u00e9es.\n(BR\u00c8VE PAUSE)\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : \u00c7a se rapporte aux Hell's Angels. Et aussi il y avait une femme qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9e et elle a eu du trouble parce qu'ils ont essay\u00e9 de la tuer. Et elle s'est rendue \u00e0 la police et n'a pas pu obtenir de l'aide et nous pr\u00e9parions un plan pour l'aider.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Et de qui avez-vous peur, madame Day? Simplement pour que je le sache.\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Je --\n(BR\u00c8VE PAUSE)\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Prenez votre temps.\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : D'accord.\n(BR\u00c8VE PAUSE)\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : J'ai peur de la police.\n(BR\u00c8VE PAUSE)\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Madame Day, vous avez dit qu'il s'agissait d'une exp\u00e9rience tr\u00e8s calme et plaisante, l'hypnose. Et vous avez expliqu\u00e9 que cela s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans le contexte de certaines craintes que vous aviez au sujet des Hell's Angels et possiblement --\nR : Je n'ai pas peur des Hell's Angels. Je n'a pas peur des Hell's Angels.\nQ : Vous n'avez pas peur des Hell's Angels, mais les pr\u00e9occupations qui \u00e9taient soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque se rapportaient aux Hell's Angels, n'est-ce pas? Est-ce exact?\nR : Je suis une Hell's Angel.\nQ : Vous \u00eates une Hell's Angel? Maintenant?\nR : Oui.\nQ : Vous \u00eates un membre des Hell's Angels?\nR : Oui.\nQ : Depuis combien de temps \u00eates-vous membre des Hell's Angels?\nR : Depuis longtemps.\nQ : \u00c9tiez-vous membre des Hell's Angels lorsque vous \u00e9tiez avec M. Hortie?\nR : Pas avec M. Hortie, mais je suis une Hell's Angel depuis longtemps.\nQ : Donc vous \u00e9tiez une Hell's Angel avant que vous --\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Pouvons-nous demander \u00e0 Mme Day ce qu'elle veut dire par cela? Que voulez-vous dire en disant cela, madame Day?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : La premi\u00e8re fois qu'on m'a dit que j'\u00e9tais une Hell's Angel, j'avais environ quinze (15) ans. Et la m\u00e8re de ma meilleure amie a dit \u00e0 ma meilleure amie de me dire que j'allais \u00eatre une Hell's Angel.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Qu'est-ce qu'un Hell's Angel?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Bien, je n'en ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait certaine, moi-m\u00eame, mais je crois qu'une Hell's Angel est quelqu'un qui est l\u00e0 pour aider quelqu'un d'autre lorsque cette personne se fait violer.\nDes pages 2963 \u00e0 2970 :\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Madame Thayer, cela ne soul\u00e8ve \u00e0 mes yeux aucun probl\u00e8me si vous pr\u00e9cisez beaucoup plus sp\u00e9cifiquement pourquoi elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 hypnotis\u00e9e.\nMme JOYCE THAYER : C'est ce que j'allais faire ensuite.\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Bien, si vous avez simplement une conversation pour vous mettre d'accord si les tueurs et quelques pauvres prostitu\u00e9es qui --\nR : Il n'a pas --\nQ : -- qui --\nR : -- vraiment --\nQ : -- si je peux vous demander, madame Day, si vous discutez de cela et comment vous pouvez aider quelqu'un qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 -- ou \u00e9tait possiblement en danger d'une telle mani\u00e8re, comment l'hypnose vous a-t-elle aid\u00e9e \u00e0 faire cela en particulier?\nR : Bien, ce qu'il a fait c'est qu'il m'a parl\u00e9 tr\u00e8s lentement et calmement et il m'a parl\u00e9 par petits bouts. Il ne m'a pas racont\u00e9 une histoire sur ce qui se passait, il me l'a simplement transmise -\nQ : Hum hum.\nR : -- des petits bouts de renseignements que j'ai pu plus tard assimiler et reconstruire moi-m\u00eame et il m'a simplement demand\u00e9 si -- si je savais que cette personne avait vraiment, vraiment besoin d'aide est-ce que j'accepterais de l'aider et j'ai dit oui et je -- nous voulions sortir et l'aider ce jour-l\u00e0 mais on m'a dit d'oublier et donc j'ai simplement oubli\u00e9 et il s'est pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps avant que tous les bouts ne reviennent \u00e0 mon souvenir.\nQ : Donc, ce que vous me dites c'est que la mani\u00e8re dont il a communiqu\u00e9 avec vous \u00e9tait hypnotique? Est-ce ce que vous dites et vous ne vous en \u00eates pas rappel\u00e9 avant un certain temps plus tard?\nR : Oui. Bien, on m'a dit d'oublier et c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9cevant au moment o\u00f9 on me l'a dit, et j'ai effectivement oubli\u00e9.\nQ : Donc, lorsque vous dites qu'on vous a dit d'oublier, c'est ce qui vous a fait croire que vous aviez \u00e9t\u00e9 hypnotis\u00e9e? Est-ce exact?\nR : Non. Peter m'a dit que Robin \u00e9tait comme Ravine et que c'\u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle -- c'est pour cela que j'ai un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d'information qui dit que mes conversations avec Robin - le gros Robin avaient un caract\u00e8re hypnotique.\nEt, en fait, maintenant que je me rends compte des choses \u00e0 travers lesquelles je suis pass\u00e9e au cours des dix (10) ann\u00e9es, c'est que j'ai r\u00e9agi et je me suis rappel\u00e9 les directives du gros Robin -- lorsque j'ai re\u00e7u le bon stimulus, je me rappelle certaines choses et je sais quoi dire ou je sais quoi faire, mais pas n\u00e9cessairement -- quand cela arrive \u00e0 ce moment, je n'ai aucune id\u00e9e pourquoi je fais ce que je fais ou pourquoi je dis ce que je dis.\nMais ensuite, plus tard, lorsque je suis capable de me souvenir mieux et de retourner \u00e0 ce moment dans le temps, alors je me rends compte que j'ai dit ce que j'ai dit en r\u00e9action \u00e0 un certain stimulus parce que -- ou j'ai fait ce que j'ai fait en r\u00e9action \u00e0 certains stimuli, parce que j'avais re\u00e7u ces directives.\nEt j'ai agi \u00e0 un -- \u00e0 partir d'un niveau subconscient et cela me fait comprendre que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 hypnotis\u00e9e.\nQ : Donc lorsque vous dites que vous aviez ces directives, vous croyez que des choses que vous faites aujourd'hui sont le r\u00e9sultat de suggestions hypnotiques qui vous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites pendant que vous \u00e9tiez sous hypnose. Est-ce exact?\nR : Oui, c'est exact.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Vous pouvez aller plus loin.\nMme JOYCE THAYER : Oui.\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Et j'aimerais dire que je suis tr\u00e8s susceptible \u00e0 l'hypnose. Je dirais que cela est certain, si -- si quelqu'un cherchait un sujet \u00e0 hypnotiser, je serais le sujet parfait parce que pour cela -- je -- je suis un bon sujet d'hypnose.\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Pouvez-vous me donner des exemples de comportement que vous reconnaissez r\u00e9cemment, ou depuis peu de temps, comme \u00e9tant le r\u00e9sultat d'une suggestion hypnotique? Pouvez-vous nous donner un exemple de quelque chose comme cela?\nR : Oui, je peux.\nQ : Veuillez nous en donner un.\nR : Bien, je sais qu'une (1) chose tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange a \u00e9t\u00e9, durant l'enqu\u00eate interne de l'employeur, l'enqu\u00eateur m'a interrog\u00e9e au sujet de la pornographie dont je me plaignais \u00e0 bord du protecteur.\nEt elle a dit, bien, qu'avez-vous vu? Et j'ai d\u00e9crit -- bien, premi\u00e8rement, j'ai d\u00e9crit ce que j'ai vu quand j'ai vu l'image et la fa\u00e7on dont je me suis alors sentie \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange.\nEt elle a dit, bien, qu'avez-vous vu, ou quelque chose comme cela. Et je -- et les mots sont sortis de ma bouche, sans que je sache pourquoi je les disais, et j'ai m\u00eame effray\u00e9 -- je me suis m\u00eame effray\u00e9e moi-m\u00eame parce que je ne comprenais pas pourquoi j'avais dit ce que j'avais dit. Et je pensais que les gens allaient penser que j'\u00e9tais folle \u00e0 cause de ce que j'avais dit.\nQ : Qu'avez-vous dit?\nR : J'ai dit, je vois Helter Skelter [ci-apr\u00e8s P\u00eale-M\u00eale]\nQ : Et vous, apr\u00e8s, avez compris que c'\u00e9tait quelque chose que Robin avait plac\u00e9 dans votre esprit pendant que vous \u00e9tiez sous hypnose?\nR : Bien, Robin m'a donn\u00e9 des directives et il a dit que si -- il a dit que j'allais voir l'image. Et il a dit que je -- je saurais -- j'allais trouver laquelle c'\u00e9tait. Il a dit que je le saurais quand je la verrais. Et que quand je la verrais, j'allais dire, je vois P\u00eale-M\u00eale.\nD'abord, il a parl\u00e9 au sujet des films et il a dit, quel est le film le plus \u00e9peurant que tu as vu?

Est-ce cela, madame Day?\nR : Bien, je me demande presque si, comme, programmer est peut-\u00eatre une fa\u00e7on trop forte de parler. Je veux dire, \u00e7a revient \u00e0 parler d'intention.\nJe dois \u00eatre honn\u00eate avec vous, je n'ai pas l'impression que, comme, lorsque mes amis m'ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'ils voulaient que je me souvienne de certaines phrases cl\u00e9s ou de messages et de choses, qu'ils essayaient de faire quelque chose qui me cause du tort ou me blesse, mais je pense que la fa\u00e7on dont M. Hortie tente d'utiliser -- tente d'utiliser les suggestions sous hypnose et de prog -- ce que je dis c'est que M. Hortie cause beaucoup de tort et qu'il essaie d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment de me manipuler avec cette sorte de -- avec exactement cette sorte de --\nQ : Et--\nR : -- suggestion et manipulation mentale --\nQ : Et --\nR : -- et je suis une personne qui -- je suis -- je suis une cible parfaite pour un manipulateur de ce genre.\nQ : Donc, ce que vous dites, c'est qu'il \u00e9tait capable d'implanter dans votre subconscient des choses qu'il vous fallait transformer en acte des ann\u00e9es plus tard? Par exemple, lorsque vous avez laiss\u00e9 \u00e9chapper le mot confiance pendant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique?\nR : Hum hum et le fait de me tenir la t\u00eate et de dire que je recevais de l'information sur diff\u00e9rentes fr\u00e9quences.\nQ : Quand avez-vous fait cela?\nR : En m'en allant \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital. J'avais appel\u00e9 Kevin Duik pour savoir s'il \u00e9tait fameux et -- et puis je r\u00e9gurgitais tout \u00e7a et c'est une des choses qui est sortie et plus tard quand je l'ai retrac\u00e9e et que je me suis rendue compte que c'\u00e9tait -- c'\u00e9tait -- la source de cela c'\u00e9tait M. Hortie.\nDes pages 3018 \u00e0 3020 :\nSUITE DU CONTRE-INTERROGATOIRE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Madame Day, quand nous avons arr\u00eat\u00e9 hier, nous parlions du fait que certaines des choses que vous avez faites au fil du temps avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat de suggestions implant\u00e9es dans votre subconscient par un certain nombre de personnes diff\u00e9rentes.\nEt vous nous avez parl\u00e9 des suggestions qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 implant\u00e9es par le Dr Brox, par certains de vos amis lorsque vous \u00e9tiez sur le pont, quand vous aviez quinze (15) ans, par Robin qui \u00e9tait le Hell's Angel et par M. Hortie.\nY a-t-il eu d'autres personnes dont vous pouvez vous rappeler qui, au cours de votre vie, vous ont fait des suggestions de ce genre, des suggestions auxquelles vous avez par la suite r\u00e9agi, les transformant en acte, et qu'il vous a fallu d\u00e9duire ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9?\nR : Oui, il y en a.\nQ : Pouvez-vous nous en parler s'il vous pla\u00eet?\nR : Quand j'\u00e9tais une jeune enfant, ma grand-m\u00e8re et ma tante et ma m\u00e8re m'ont emmen\u00e9e \u00e0 une \u00e9glise \u00e0 Calgary. Et il y avait tout un groupe d'enfants l\u00e0 et nous avons vu un pr\u00eatre et le pr\u00eatre nous parlait et j'\u00e9tais tr\u00e8s jeune.\nEt il a demand\u00e9 s'il y avait des volontaires, et j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 l'une des enfants ayant lev\u00e9 la main. Et il a \u00e9crit mon nom sur une liste, et il nous a dit que ce qu'il voulait que nous fassions c'est que si nous savions qu'il y avait un tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s mauvais homme, que nous allions pouvoir parler \u00e0 Dieu.\nEt ce qu'il voulait que nous fassions c'\u00e9tait de regarder \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre \u00e0 gauche, en haut de l'\u00e9glise. Et lorsque nous allions regarder l\u00e0, alors nous allions savoir que Dieu nous parlait et lorsqu'il faudrait dire aux gens o\u00f9 il y avait un homme vraiment m\u00e9chant, m\u00e9chant, que nous pouvions dire \u00e0 ces gens que Dieu nous parlait et que Dieu nous disait quoi faire.\nEt il a dit qu'il voulait que nous sachions, quelque chose comme, ces choses sont tr\u00e8s difficiles mais nous devions nous sentir en s\u00e9curit\u00e9, au fond de nous-m\u00eames, que nous -- que nous pouvions \u00eatre la voix de Dieu.\nQ : Et quand avez-vous transform\u00e9 en acte ce que le pr\u00eatre vous avait dit de faire lorsque vous \u00e9tiez une jeune enfant?\nR : Bien, je sais que quand j'ai eu mon audience de redressement de grief avec le capitaine Blattman, il n'a pas cru que j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e sexuellement et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me poser toutes sortes de questions tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s stupides et qui \u00e9taient simplement tr\u00e8s hostiles.\nEt je me souviens que j'avais vraiment peur que par la suite il penserait que j'\u00e9tais folle parce que je me souviens avoir regard\u00e9 vers le haut, \u00e0 gauche, puis avoir regard\u00e9 le capitaine Blattman et avoir dit nettement au capitaine Blattman, et parce que Dieu me dit de le dire, parce que Dieu me disait de pr\u00e9senter la plainte.\nMais alors, je pense que mon repr\u00e9sentant syndical a \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu ennuy\u00e9 par le fait que j'avais dit quelque chose comme \u00e7a et j'\u00e9tais, d'une certaine fa\u00e7on, ennuy\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet moi-m\u00eame. Et je n'ai pas -- cela m'a pris plus d'un an pour me rendre compte o\u00f9 cela -- d'o\u00f9 cette phrase que j'avais dite provenait parce que c'\u00e9tait quelque chose qu'on m'avait dit de faire quand j'\u00e9tais une tr\u00e8s jeune enfant et je l'ai fait sans y penser.\nMais lorsque -- cela m'a fait avoir l'air d'une folle mais quand -- et puis cela m'a pris longtemps pour comprendre pourquoi j'avais dit que Dieu me disait de leur dire cela.\nDes pages 3043 \u00e0 3047 :\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Madame Day, pouvez-vous nous parler de situations o\u00f9 M. Hortie a contest\u00e9 vos perceptions d'une mani\u00e8re qui vous fait vous sentir folle?\nR : Oui, je veux dire, il a fait \u00e7a un jour -- quotidiennement. Je pense que chaque contact que j'ai eu avec M. Hortie \u00e9tait -- \u00e9tait manipulateur au point qu'il -- il prenait ma perception de la situation qui se tenait debout, comme une analogie, et puis il la prenait et la retournait \u00e0 l'envers et me disait que c'\u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement de cette fa\u00e7on, qui \u00e9tait sa fa\u00e7on \u00e0 lui, et je veux dire, si je disais que quelque chose \u00e9tait blanc, il r\u00e9pondait, non, c'est noir.\nC'\u00e9tait \u00e0 ce point -- c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 ce point distinct.\nQ : Est-ce que cela vous faisait vous sentir folle ou mettre en doute votre propre --\nR : Cela me pla\u00e7ait dans une situation o\u00f9 je devais constamment confronter mes perceptions avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. J'\u00e9tais constamment -- j'\u00e9tais en crise tout le temps parce que ma perception \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'envers. J'allais travailler et j'allais \u00e0 la maison. C'\u00e9tait comme -- c'est comme si -- c'est comme si je me promenais \u00e0 l'envers et voyais le monde entier \u00e0 l'envers.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Dites-moi --\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : C'\u00e9tait -\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Parlez-moi d'avantage de -\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : C'\u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait -\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : --Cela, madame Day.\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : -- m\u00ealant.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Madame Day, je veux en savoir davantage \u00e0 ce sujet. Pouvez-vous nous donner des exemples?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Tout. Tout \u00e0 fait tout.\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Bien, donnez-nous simplement un exemple sp\u00e9cifique. Je sais que c' \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s persuasif mais il doit y avoir certaines choses qui ressortent comme \u00e9tant particuli\u00e8rement anormales ou que vous ne pouviez tout simplement pas croire apr\u00e8s avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, par confrontation avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, qu'il vous avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 cela?\nR : Bien, justement le fait que - justement le fait qu'il pouvait toucher mon corps sans ma permission a - vir\u00e9 mon monde r\u00e9el \u00e0 l'envers. D'accord? Le fait qu'il pouvait physiquement me toucher, pousser sa langue dans ma bouche, mettre son p\u00e9nis dans mon corps - dans ma bouche, dans mon vagin et dans mon derri\u00e8re, le fait qu'il avait le droit, il se donnait le droit de faire ces choses contre ma volont\u00e9 et sans ma permission et le fait qu'il pouvait m\u00eame simplement me toucher. Comme - comme c'\u00e9tait assez.\nQ : Que voulez-vous --\nR : Apr\u00e8s un bout de temps, il suffisait d'un simple toucher, comme -- j'avais l'impression que tout mon corps \u00e9tait en feu. Comme, je me sentais comme une victime br\u00fbl\u00e9e. M\u00eame juste -- et juste n'importe qui.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Et vous vous touchez tr\u00e8s doucement?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : N'importe qui qui fait simplement s'approcher de mon espace corporel me touchant comme cela me donnait l'impression -- j'avais l'impression d'\u00eatre comme une victime br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Qu'est-ce que vous voulez dire que cela avait renvers\u00e9 votre -- quels \u00e9taient les mots? Renvers\u00e9 votre perception de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9?\nSUITE PAR Mme JOYCE THAYER :\nQ : Vous avez dit que vous aviez l'impression de marcher \u00e0 l'envers, la t\u00eate en bas, tout le temps?\nR : Oui. J'avais l'impression - cela -- la mani\u00e8re -- la mani\u00e8re dont mon esprit r\u00e9agissait \u00e0 cause de ce qu'il faisait c'\u00e9tait que, comme, j'\u00e9tais -- mon monde \u00e9tait habituellement normal. J'avais l'habitude de voir -- comme, j'avais l'habitude de voir les gens normalement. Comme vous \u00eates tous \u00e0 l'endroit mais l'impression que mon esprit me donnait lorsque M. Hortie me harcelait, j'avais l'impression que je voyais tout \u00e0 l'envers. Comme, c'\u00e9tait comme -- je m'excuse de dire des jurons. Je ne vais pas jurer.\nQ : D'accord.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Dites ce que vous voulez dire.\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Je me sentais tellement toute fourr\u00e9e dans ma t\u00eate \u00e0 cause de la fa\u00e7on dont M. Hortie colorait ma perception des choses et interpr\u00e9tait -- il interpr\u00e9tait toutes mes donn\u00e9es perceptuelles et me disait ce qui se passait au milieu de travail et dans ma -- dans ma propre vie personnelle que je v\u00e9rifiais en confrontant mes perceptions avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 moi-m\u00eame --\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Et vous dites qu'il pr\u00e9sentait tout de travers?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Il avait tout -- il me disait tout \u00e0 l'envers mais c'est la seule fa\u00e7on dont je peux vous l'expliquer.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Est-ce qu'il s'agissait seulement de M. Hortie ou s'agissait-il aussi d'autres gens?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Non, c'\u00e9tait seulement M. Hortie. Je veux dire, il y avait -- mais alors il y avait des choses circonstancielles venant de gens en milieu de travail qui appuyaient ce que M. Hortie disait qu'il m'arrivait.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Donc, comment avez-vous compos\u00e9 avec cela? Donc, vous voulez dire que vous --\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Cela -- cela m'a certainement in -- influenc\u00e9e et cela -- cela me donnait l'impression que j'\u00e9tais compl\u00e8tement incapable de -- de me sortir de cette situation. Je me sentais pi\u00e9g\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de l'existence de circonstances qui \u00e9taient - qui \u00e9taient des preuves tr\u00e8s solides que, en fait, je ne pouvais pas obtenir de l'aide et que je devais me conformer aux conditions qui \u00e9taient impos\u00e9es \u00e0 mon emploi.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Madame Thayer, il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une question importante et je pense que je devrais la poser. Et je sais que cela sera difficile pour vous, madame Day. Mais n'avez-vous pas envisag\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me soit dans votre t\u00eate?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Bien s\u00fbr j'ai examin\u00e9 le prob -- j'ai envisag\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait dans mon esprit, cela fait partie de la confrontation avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Donc, dites-moi --\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Parce que tout cela arrivait et je - je -- apr\u00e8s un bout de temps je suis devenue tellement m\u00eal\u00e9e, c'est un meilleur mot, je suis devenue tellement m\u00eal\u00e9e que je -- comme, je veux dire, j'\u00e9tais m\u00eal\u00e9e depuis le tout d\u00e9but. Disons simplement que, j'\u00e9tais en train de devenir vraiment, vraiment m\u00eal\u00e9e depuis le tout d\u00e9but.\nMais je suis devenue tellement gravement m\u00eal\u00e9e -- je suis devenue tellement gravement m\u00eal\u00e9e que je pouvais juste -- j'\u00e9tais juste -- je me sentais comme si j'\u00e9tais une carcasse. Je me sentais comme un corps mort, j'\u00e9tais compl\u00e8tement engourdie. Je veux dire, j'\u00e9tais engourdie depuis le d\u00e9but, mais je veux dire vraiment, vraiment, vraiment engourdie. Comme -- comme, j'avais l'impression qu'on m'avait inject\u00e9 des anesth\u00e9siques, j'\u00e9tais tellement engourdie, je n'avais plus aucun sentiment. Je n'avais pas une (1) once de sentiment.\nEt c'\u00e9tait avant sept -- comme, octobre de 1994, lorsque j'\u00e9tais de retour \u00e0 l'atelier \u00e0 l'\u00e9difice 190. J'\u00e9tais juste -- j'\u00e9tais un corps mort qui d\u00e9ambulait.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Et qu'est-ce qui est arriv\u00e9, madame Day? Est-ce que les choses se sont am\u00e9lior\u00e9es ou empir\u00e9es?\nLA T\u00c9MOIN : Bien, j'ai juste -- je pensais, bien, je vais prendre des risques. Et j'ai dit \u00e0 Rod Lundgren qu'il me fallait aller chez un psychologue et que je, vous savez, s'ils pouvaient -- s'ils pouvaient obtenir un psychologue pour moi que je leur en serais grandement reconnaissante.\nEt je -- comme, je le regrette vraiment mais je suis \u00e9videmment tellement -- je suis \u00e9videmment, vous savez, j'ai besoin d'un psychiatre tout de suite parce que je suis une personne gravement m\u00eal\u00e9e et je ne peux pas fonctionner.\nJe veux dire, et j'ai reconnu que je -- que j'\u00e9tais -- je veux dire que j'\u00e9tais comme, \u00e0 plat. Normalement, dans une journ\u00e9e, une personne a -- comme si nous traversions toute une gamme d'\u00e9motions. Dans -- dans une heure vous pouvez ressentir -- je ne sais pas combien d'\u00e9motions que vous pouvez ressentir, cinq (5) ou six (6) \u00e9motions importantes dans une heure, simplement par l'interm\u00e9diaire de vos pens\u00e9es naturelles ou de toute autre chose.\nMais, vous savez -- vous savez, vous montez, vous redescendez, \u00e7a monte \u00e7a descend, \u00e7a monte, \u00e7a descend. Mais j'\u00e9tais comme, \u00e0 plat. Je n'avais aucune \u00e9motion. J'\u00e9tais comme -- j'\u00e9tais comme un corps mort. Et c'\u00e9tait tout comme, vous savez, je suis \u00e9videmment tellement folle \u00e0 cause de ma -- je sais qu'on me harc\u00e8le pr\u00e9sentement ici, et je sais que toutes ces choses arrivent, mais ce gars-l\u00e0 me dit des choses comme, bien, si quelqu'un s'informe de mes probl\u00e8mes, dis-leur simplement que nous allons nous marier et des choses du m\u00eame genre.\nEt puis les menaces et puis -- et puis, quand j'ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler -- lorsque les gens me parlaient en milieu de travail, les menaces physiques, qu'il allait blesser d'autres gens, ou qu'il allait me blesser.\nEt je ne savais encore o\u00f9 son fusil \u00e9tait, vous savez. Il va se faire sauter la cervelle et il va le faire dans ma maison. Tout cela \u00e9tait des choses vraiment \u00e9peurantes. Et, oui, j'avais des doutes -- je -- c'est une -- je pense que c'est naturel, un processus sain. Si vous ne confrontez pas vos perceptions avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, vous -- si une personne ne v\u00e9rifie pas quel est son rapport avec le monde r\u00e9el, alors c'est ce genre de personne que vous voyez dans les h\u00f4pitaux.\nEt le fait que je pensais que j'\u00e9tais, que je pourrais \u00eatre folle, je pense que cela est un indice que j'\u00e9tais en v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en sant\u00e9. Mais j'\u00e9tais vraiment, vraiment m\u00eal\u00e9e. Et il me fallait avoir -- et c'est pourquoi j'ai demand\u00e9 si je pouvais aller voir -- avoir un psychologue.\nAUTRE EXTRAIT\nDes pages 3077 \u00e0 3080 :\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Mais ce dont il vous faut parler c'est de votre aptitude \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Et le probl\u00e8me est que vous avez dit un certain nombre de choses qui montrent clairement que vous pouvez difficilement distinguer entre vos perceptions et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\nMme AMANDA DAY : Je ne pense pas que je --\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Et que ces perceptions --\nMme AMANDA DAY : -- J'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 distinguer entre mes perceptions et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Je pense, il est clair que l'employeur applique un processus de brouillage, et il est clair que mes perceptions sont color\u00e9es par M. Hortie. Et, clairement, lorsque vous ouvrez le voir-dire, et je comprends qu'il y a des questions d'habilit\u00e9 et qu'il y a des questions juridiques, que je ne comprends pas.\nMais lorsque les gens -- je veux dire, m\u00eame si des personnes me disent qu'elles ont l'impression que je souffre de parano\u00efa et de pens\u00e9e d\u00e9lirante, alors cela influence ma perception au point o\u00f9 je dois m'interroger moi-m\u00eame, \u00e0 savoir si oui ou non je souffre de parano\u00efa et de pens\u00e9e d\u00e9lirante.\nDonc c'est comme le principe d'incertitude de Hydenberg (phon\u00e9tique), vous --vous ne pouvez mesurer une (1) chose et vous ne pouvez savoir avec certitude la position d'une (1) chose, lorsque -- lorsque vous essayez de faire quelque chose d'autre.\nEt la situation devient tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 r\u00e9gler. Et je vous dis que, ma perception de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est valide. Et votre perception de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est la v\u00f4tre. Et la v\u00f4tre est diff\u00e9rente et la mienne est diff\u00e9rente; cela ne veut pas dire que la mienne est mauvaise ou que je suis handicap\u00e9e.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Je pense que je me trouve dans la situation o\u00f9 je dois supposer qu'une partie de ce que vous nous avez dit, est arriv\u00e9 dans votre esprit plut\u00f4t que dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\nMme AMANDA DAY : Bien, je pense que d\u00e9finitivement cette personne -- ce que M. Hortie m'a fait, c'\u00e9tait de m\u00e9langer ma t\u00eate d'une fa\u00e7on qui a fait qu'il a pu ex\u00e9cuter ces abus sexuels et ces agressions sexuelles et ce harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\nEt c'est clair, qu'il y a plusieurs choses qui m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dites, et qu'il a manip -- qu'il a manipul\u00e9 ma perception et qu'il -- M. Hortie a fauss\u00e9 ma perception \u00e0 ce moment.\nMais je vous dis que, maintenant, je suis consciente que ces choses arrivaient et que je sais pourquoi j'\u00e9prouvais tellement de difficult\u00e9. Je ne dis pas que j'ai encore ces probl\u00e8mes maintenant, ce qui est fondamentalement diff\u00e9rent du fait que je sois consciente de ce qui m'arrivait alors, en r\u00e9trospective.\n(BR\u00c8VE PAUSE)\nMme AMANDA DAY : Toutefois, je, moi-m\u00eame, je -- j'en suis \u00e0 me poser des questions \u00e0 savoir si oui ou non je suis toujours sous l'influence des directives que m'a donn\u00e9es M. Hortie, des choses par suggestion. Je ne suis pas s\u00fbre jusqu'\u00e0 quel point je suis suicidaire, je ne suis pas s\u00fbre jusqu'\u00e0 quel point je peux me blesser.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Cela me pr\u00e9occupe, madame Day.\nMme AMANDA DAY : Oui, et cela me pr\u00e9occupe aussi. Et lorsque je suis all\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison hier, j'ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre -- commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 penser et \u00e0 essayer de comprendre ce qui, vous savez -- parce que je pense que c'est l\u00e0 une autre chose que les gens aiment faire, c'est de vous m\u00e9langer tellement qu'ils -- ils peuvent m\u00eame, vous savez, d'une certaine mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9dire la voie que vous prendrez plus tard.\nEt, je veux dire, il me disait des choses comme, le harc\u00e8lement allait me faire sentir -- j'allais avoir tellement un sentiment de, tellement, tellement de peine parce que j'\u00e9tais harcel\u00e9e par tous ces gens. Alors que c'\u00e9tait celui qui influen\u00e7ait ma perception et me disait que personne ne m'aimait et que personne ne voulait travailler avec moi.\nDonc, ce sont des choses qui ont m\u00fbri au fil du temps, que je n'ai pas comprises. Mais elles m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es par suggestion par -- \u00e0 moi par M. Hortie. Je me trouve donc au point o\u00f9 il me reste \u00e0 me demander, bien, je ne sais pas ce qu'il a implant\u00e9 d'autre dans mon esprit.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Avez-vous --\nMme AMANDA DAY : Et la question de savoir si je suis ou non suicidaire est une autre -- est une autre chose \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration pour -- pour une victime de ce genre.

L'objection est que le plaignant a sign\u00e9 une renonciation compl\u00e8te \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question dont le Tribunal est saisi. La pr\u00e9sente controverse gravite autour de la question \u00e0 savoir si l'objection devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e avant l'audience ou apr\u00e8s l'audition de la preuve.\n[2] Il est admis que le plaignant souffrait d'une d\u00e9pression nerveuse lorsqu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de l'Administration portuaire de Halifax et qu'il a subs\u00e9quemment \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Selon l'employeur, le cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9. Dans sa plainte, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que son cong\u00e9diement constituait un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience aux termes de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Toutefois, l'intim\u00e9e va plus loin et soutient que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant a sign\u00e9 une entente de r\u00e8glement sur la question. L'entente dont il s'agit renferme, semble-t-il, une clause de renonciation pr\u00e9cisant que l'intim\u00e9e a satisfait aux obligations qui lui incombaient en vertu du Code canadien du travail et de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[3] La Commission des droits de la personne a initialement refus\u00e9 de traiter la plainte aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 41(1)b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, pour le motif qu'une entente de r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait intervenue avec le plaignant. Saisie de l'affaire (Brine c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1999] A.C.F. no 1439 (Q.L.), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a renvoy\u00e9 celle-ci \u00e0 la Commission. Le juge Lemieux a jug\u00e9 que la Commission n'avait pas tenu compte d'un rapport sur l'\u00e9tat psychologique du plaignant \u00e9tabli par M. Dunphy, l'un de ses propres enqu\u00eateurs. Au paragraphe 44 du rapport(1), l'enqu\u00eateur a \u00e9crit :\nLa preuve fournie par le psychologue du plaignant d\u00e9montre que le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9motivement en mesure de d\u00e9fendre ses int\u00e9r\u00eats quand il a sign\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement.\nIl semble que la Commission et le plaignant pr\u00e9tendent maintenant que le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure, compte tenu de son incapacit\u00e9 psychologique, de signer une renonciation ayant force ex\u00e9cutoire.\n[4] La Commission et le plaignant soutiennent que le Tribunal n'est pas en mesure de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement sans un dossier de preuves complet. De l'avis de la Commission, le Tribunal :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u2026 ne peut d\u00e9cider de l'issue finale de cette plainte par voie de requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, sans\u2026 entendre toute la preuve concernant la plainte.\nL'intim\u00e9e s'oppose, faisant valoir que [TRADUCTION] la d\u00e9marche \u00e0 suivre consiste \u00e0 tenir une audience distincte [TRADUCTION] pour examiner la question de la renonciation, ce qui implique notamment l'audition d'une preuve et une argumentation, avant d'instruire la plainte. On pourrait \u00e9galement proc\u00e9der par voie de voir-dire au d\u00e9but de l'audience.\n[5] Dans ses observations, la Commission fait remarquer que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale exige que le Tribunal se prononce sur la question de la renonciation apr\u00e8s l'audience sur le fond de la plainte. Je ne vois pas la logique de cet argument. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9nonce pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les responsabilit\u00e9s de la Commission, organisme d'enqu\u00eate ayant pour mandat de r\u00e9gler des plaintes. Au paragraphe 39, le juge Lemieux indique que la Commission exerce des fonctions d'administration et d'examen pr\u00e9liminaire pr\u00e9alable sans pouvoir d\u00e9cisionnel important. Le r\u00f4le de la Commission est assez semblable \u00e0 celui d'un juge \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. La Commission n'a pas pour r\u00f4le d'instruire la plainte et n'a pas le pouvoir de trancher des questions dont un tribunal serait normalement saisi.\n[6] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale devait en fait d\u00e9terminer si la Commission avait rejet\u00e9 la plainte sans examiner la preuve et les circonstances entourant l'affaire. Toutefois, la Commission ne rend pas le m\u00eame genre de d\u00e9cisions que le Tribunal et ne peut trancher la question. Si la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est importante en l'esp\u00e8ce, c'est surtout parce qu'elle d\u00e9montre qu'il existe un litige entre les parties sur la question du r\u00e8glement. Il semble \u00e9vident qu'un tribunal ne peut dans un tel cas d\u00e9terminer, sans un dossier de preuves complet, si la renonciation a force ex\u00e9cutoire. Par dossier de preuves complet, j'entends simplement le dossier de preuves d\u00e9taill\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour se prononcer. La question \u00e0 savoir si cela exige une instruction en bonne et due forme est sujette \u00e0 d\u00e9bat.\n[7] Je ne suis pas aussi s\u00fbr que l'intim\u00e9e qu'il convienne de qualifier de question de comp\u00e9tence le point dont je suis saisi, bien que le terme comp\u00e9tence ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9norm\u00e9ment galvaud\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence. L'argument de base de l'intim\u00e9e n'en est pas moins convaincant. Il semble irraisonnable de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audience en bonne et due forme, alors qu'on ne sait pas vraiment s'il existe un litige - un lis - entre les parties. L'intim\u00e9e invoque la d\u00e9cision Chow v. Mobile Oil Canada, [1999] A.J. No 949 (Q.L.) (C.B.R. Alberta), dans laquelle la cour pr\u00e9cise, au paragraphe 100, qu'une question similaire soumise \u00e0 une commission d'enqu\u00eate soul\u00e8ve une question de comp\u00e9tence, d'o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de trancher la question avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'instruction de la plainte. L'intim\u00e9e fait valoir, sur la foi de cette d\u00e9cision, que le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal ne peut instruire la plainte sans avoir entendu et tranch\u00e9 l'objection.\n[8] Comme je l'ai dit, j'ai tendance \u00e0 croire qu'il est exag\u00e9r\u00e9 de parler de comp\u00e9tence. M\u00eame si la renonciation touche la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour poursuivre la proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal semble disposer d'une certaine latitude \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Dans Mohawk Council of Kahnawake c. Jacobs, 1996 A.C.F. no 757 (Q.L.), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision d'un tribunal d'entendre l'ensemble de la preuve avant de se prononcer sur la question de comp\u00e9tence. La juge Tremblay-Lamer a affirm\u00e9 que le tribunal \u00e9tait ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et a refus\u00e9 d'intervenir. On peut trouver hors de l'ar\u00e8ne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale des cas o\u00f9 on a abond\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens (p. ex., Newfoundland (Human Rights Commission) v. Newfoundland (Department of Health), [1998] N.J. No. 129 (C.A. Terre-Neuve).\n[9] Il s'ensuit que le Tribunal jouit du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de se pencher sur la question du r\u00e8glement avant ou apr\u00e8s l'audience, selon ce qui semble pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable dans les circonstances. Bien que ce ne soit pas une option qui s'offre \u00e0 moi, je soup\u00e7onne que la situation actuelle pourrait \u00eatre r\u00e9solue par une ordonnance de fournir une garantie pour les d\u00e9pens devant les tribunaux civils. S'il devient \u00e9vident \u00e0 la fin de l'audience que celle-ci n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, l'intim\u00e9e aurait au moins l'assurance de recevoir un d\u00e9dommagement pour ses efforts. Cela n'est pas possible dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le consensus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral voulant que la partie intim\u00e9e n'ait pas droit aux d\u00e9pens. Il peut en r\u00e9sulter une injustice. Il est relativement facile pour la partie plaignante et la Commission d'insister sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'entendre toute la preuve, en sachant que l'autre partie devra assumer une grande part des frais.\n[10] Le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi soul\u00e8ve une question connexe, \u00e0 savoir que l'instruction des plaintes se fait de la fa\u00e7on la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible dans les circonstances. \u00c0 mon avis, cette r\u00e8gle s'applique tout autant aux questions pr\u00e9liminaires et de proc\u00e9dure qu'\u00e0 l'audience sur le fond. La loi habilitante appuie par cons\u00e9quent le principe voulant que les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal soient prises sommairement, dans la mesure du possible. La partie intim\u00e9e n'a peut-\u00eatre pas droit aux d\u00e9pens ou \u00e0 une garantie pour les d\u00e9pens; cependant, elle a droit \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement rapide et efficace de la plainte. Le Tribunal doit prendre soin de ne pas p\u00e9naliser l'intim\u00e9 en faisant en sorte que l'affaire dure plus longtemps que normalement.\n[11] En outre, il y a des raisons de croire que les questions li\u00e9es aux renonciations soient de nature pr\u00e9liminaire, ainsi qu'en t\u00e9moigne la jurisprudence rendue en vertu des r\u00e8gles de cour en vigueur dans les diverses provinces. Dans Sinclair-Cockburn Insurance Brokers Ltd. v. Richards [2002] O.J. No. 3288 (Q.L.), par exemple, la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario s'est pench\u00e9e sur un ensemble de faits plut\u00f4t bouleversants entourant une affaire de cautionnement frauduleux. Au paragraphe 14, la cour a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nComme l'a indiqu\u00e9 dans son plaidoyer oral l'avocat de Wiggins, Me Cadsby, son client a pay\u00e9 une somme appr\u00e9ciable pour acheter la paix, et ce, non pas simplement la paix quant au risque qu'il puisse \u00eatre jug\u00e9 responsable par un tribunal, mais aussi la paix m\u00eame en ce qui concerne l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation de Mme Richards. Sinclair-Cockburn a sign\u00e9 une renonciation compl\u00e8te. Wiggins a droit \u00e0 tous les avantages qui d\u00e9coulent de cette renonciation, notamment quant \u00e0 sa r\u00e9putation et \u00e0 son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ne pas faire l'objet d'une poursuite devant les tribunaux.\nLa force de ce raisonnement peut varier selon le cas. Cependant, les divers int\u00e9r\u00eats en cause militent grandement en faveur d'un r\u00e8glement h\u00e2tif des questions litigieuses qui d\u00e9coulent d'un r\u00e8glement entre les parties.\n[12] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision ne porte pas sur le fond de la requ\u00eate. C'est voulu. Le plaignant et la Commission soutiendront peut-\u00eatre qu'il n'est pas pratique d'isoler la question du r\u00e8glement des autres questions que soul\u00e8ve l'affaire. Je dis cela parce qu'ils semblent pr\u00e9tendre que le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure, \u00e0 cause de ses probl\u00e8mes psychologiques, de conclure un r\u00e8glement ayant force ex\u00e9cutoire. Si telle est leur position, on peut certes arguer qu'il sera impossible de d\u00e9terminer si le r\u00e8glement a force ex\u00e9cutoire sans entendre la preuve concernant la nature et l'\u00e9tendue de sa d\u00e9ficience. Il sera peut-\u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire \u00e9galement d'entendre la preuve portant sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte \u00e0 l'origine. Il s'agit donc de d\u00e9terminer s'il est possible d'isoler la question du r\u00e8glement des autres questions en cause.\n[13] Les observations qui m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ne traitent pas de cette question. Celle-ci devra \u00eatre examin\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de l'audience. J'inviterai alors les avocats \u00e0 me dire s'il est possible \u00e0 leur avis de dissocier la question de la renonciation des autres questions. Je partage l'opinion de l'intim\u00e9e selon laquelle il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, dans la mesure du possible, de trancher la question du r\u00e8glement avant de poursuivre la proc\u00e9dure. Toutefois, il faut pr\u00e9server dans la mesure du possible l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l'audience et je ne vois aucune raison d'examiner cette question dans le cadre d'une requ\u00eate distincte. Au regard des circonstances entourant la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je crois qu'il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de proc\u00e9der par voie de voir-dire. S'il devient \u00e9vident en entendant la preuve que le r\u00e8glement n'a pas force ex\u00e9cutoire, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le cadre du voir-dire pourra alors s'appliquer \u00e0 l'audience dans son ensemble.\n(Originale sign\u00e9e par)\nPaul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nle 29 avril 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL NO : T758\/0803\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Bruce Brine c.

L'ORDONNANCE\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Richard Warman est un avocat d'Ottawa. Le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2002, M. Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne une plainte contre Fred Kyburz. Dans sa plainte, M. Warman a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que M. Kyburz a utilis\u00e9 son site Web pour diffuser des messages exposant \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des groupes identifiables, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. M. Warman a ult\u00e9rieurement modifi\u00e9 sa plainte, avec l'autorisation du Tribunal, afin d'y inclure une autre all\u00e9gation, \u00e0 savoir que M. Kyburz a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui parce qu'il a port\u00e9 plainte \u00e0 la Commission des droits de la personne, ce qui va \u00e0 l'encontre de l'article 14.1 de la Loi. M. Warman a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que ces repr\u00e9sailles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es au moyen du compte personnel de courrier \u00e9lectronique et du forum de discussion de M. Kyburz.\nII. D\u00c9FAUT DE FRED KYBURZ DE COMPARA\u00ceTRE \u00c0 L'AUDIENCE [2] Ni M. Kyburz ni aucun mandataire n'a comparu \u00e0 l'audience sur la plainte de M. Warman. Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. Kyburz s'est vu signifier personnellement la documentation concernant la plainte. Les documents signifi\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Kyburz comprenaient l'avis d'audience, qui indiquait les dates et le lieu de celle-ci. Peu apr\u00e8s qu'ils eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Kyburz, ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9s au Tribunal, avec la mention [TRADUCTION] Retourn\u00e9s pour fraude et absence de comp\u00e9tence inscrite en travers de la page liminaire, suivie de ce qui semblait \u00eatre la signature de M. Kyburz (1). M. Kyburz a \u00e9galement transmis au Tribunal un avis de droit d'auteur concernant le nom d'Ernst-Friedrich Kyburz.\n[3] Le Tribunal est convaincu que M. Kyburz a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de la plainte de M. Warman et de la tenue de l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce. Cette conclusion est confirm\u00e9e par le mat\u00e9riel t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du forum Web de M. Kyburz, qui d\u00e9montre tr\u00e8s clairement que ce dernier \u00e9tait au courant de l'audience et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas participer \u00e0 l'instance.\nIII. LES QUESTIONS \u00c0 EXAMINER [4] En ce qui concerne le volet de la plainte de M. Warman relevant de l'article 13, il y a trois questions \u00e0 examiner pour d\u00e9terminer s'il est fond\u00e9 (2) :\nM. Kyburz a-t-il diffus\u00e9 ou fait diffuser de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e les messages contenus dans le site Web en question? Ces messages ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s en recourant aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement? Les questions abord\u00e9es dans les messages sont-elles susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3?\n[5] Le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement d\u00e9terminer si M. Kyburz a exerc\u00e9 ou menac\u00e9 d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Warman en raison de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e initialement par ce dernier aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en vertu de l'article 13, en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[6] Si l'un et(ou) l'autre volet de la plainte sont fond\u00e9s, il faudra d\u00e9terminer les mesures de redressement qui s'imposent.\nIV. LE VOLET DE LA PLAINTE RELEVANT DE L'ARTICLE 13 A. M. Kyburz a-t-il diffus\u00e9 ou fait diffuser de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e les messages contenus dans le site Web en question? [7] Le volet de la plainte de M. Warman relevant de l'article 13 a trait \u00e0 un site Web, dont l'adresse est www.patriotsonguard.org. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, M. Warman a identifi\u00e9 de nombreux documents qu'il avait t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de ce site, y compris la page d'accueil et de nombreux feuillets d'information quotidiens (FIQ). La page d'accueil d\u00e9crit la mission des Patriots on Guard et pr\u00e9cise que la page Web est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Fred Kyburz, de Coleman, en Alberta. Chaque FIQ d\u00e9bute par un message de bienvenue qui invite le lecteur \u00e0 s'abonner au bulletin de nouvelles mensuel des Patriots on Guard. Les frais d'abonnement doivent \u00eatre acquitt\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s de Fred Kyburz, Poste restante, Bureau de poste de Blairmore, Blairmore (Alberta).\n[8] M. Warman a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait fait des recherches dans le site www.register.com qui, a-t-il expliqu\u00e9, fournit les noms des titulaires d'adresse Web. Ces recherches ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le titulaire inscrit du site www.patriotsonguard.org \u00e9tait Fred Kyburz, Poste restante, Bureau de poste de Blairmore, Blairmore (Alberta).\n[9] Au regard de la preuve qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, le Tribunal conclut que Fred Kyburz avait la haute main sur le site www.patriotsonguard.org. En outre, le Tribunal est persuad\u00e9 que M. Kyburz a fait diffuser le mat\u00e9riel contenu dans ce site-l\u00e0. Le fait qu'un site Web soit un m\u00e9dium relativement passif qui exige que le lecteur pose des gestes concrets pour avoir acc\u00e8s au mat\u00e9riel qui y est publi\u00e9 n'att\u00e9nue en rien la situation : M. Kyburz, en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeant le mat\u00e9riel vers le serveur Web, a diffus\u00e9 le mat\u00e9riel en question (3).\n[10] Le dernier point \u00e0 examiner est l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition. Le degr\u00e9 de diffusion de ces messages atteste l'efficacit\u00e9 d'Internet comme outil de communication. Le site Web des Patriots on Guard avait un compteur de visiteurs. Le 10 septembre 2001, au moment o\u00f9 M. Warman a t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 le feuillet du jour, le nombre de visiteurs s'\u00e9tablissait \u00e0 61 370.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, nous sommes convaincus que M. Kyburz a diffus\u00e9 ou fait diffuser de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e les messages contenus dans le site Web en question.\nB. Ces messages ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s en recourant aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement? [12] Les messages vis\u00e9s par le volet de la plainte de M. Warman relevant de l'article 13 sont ceux qui figuraient sur le site Web des Patriots on Guard. Le dernier message du genre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 porte la date du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2001 et semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 par M. Warman ce jour-l\u00e0.\n[13] Comme nous l'expliquerons plus en d\u00e9tail plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, M. Warman s'est plaint du contenu du site Web des Patriots on Guard au fournisseur de services Internet de M. Kyburz, ce qui a amen\u00e9 ce dernier \u00e0 retirer le service. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Warman a affirm\u00e9 que le site des Patriots on Guard a \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 en permanence vers la fin de d\u00e9cembre 2001 ou au d\u00e9but de janvier 2002.\n[14] On ne sait trop quelle version de l'article 13 s'applique au site Web des Patriots on Guard. La version initiale de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne traitait pas de fa\u00e7on explicite des communications Internet. Cela n'a rien d'\u00e9tonnant puisque la promulgation de l'article 13 remonte \u00e0 1977, soit bien avant qu'Internet ne devienne partie int\u00e9grante de notre vie. Dans le cadre de la r\u00e9forme dont la l\u00e9gislation canadienne a fait l'objet par suite de la proclamation de la Loi contre le terrorisme (4) le 24 d\u00e9cembre 2001, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e afin d'ajouter la disposition suivante au paragraphe 13(2) :\nIl demeure entendu que le paragraphe (1) s'applique \u00e0 l'utilisation d'un ordinateur, d'un ensemble d'ordinateurs connect\u00e9s ou reli\u00e9s les uns aux autres, notamment d'Internet, ou de tout autre moyen de communication semblable\n[15] Toutefois, il n'importe pas en fin de compte de d\u00e9terminer si les messages de M. Kyburz ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s avant que les modifications soient apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation (5). Dans Citron et autres c. Z\u00fcndel (6), le Tribunal a conclu que la version ant\u00e9rieure de l'article 13 s'appliquait aux communications Internet; nous faisons n\u00f4tre le raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le Tribunal dans cette affaire.\nC. Les questions abord\u00e9es dans les messages sont-elles susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3? i) Quelles sont les questions abord\u00e9es dans les messages diffus\u00e9s par M. Kyburz? [16] Afin de situer en contexte les messages litigieux, il est utile d'examiner la mission des Patriots on Guard, telle que d\u00e9crite par ce groupe. Selon la page d'accueil de leur site Web, les Patriots on Guard sont une organisation ayant pour mission de mettre en garde la population contre le travestissement des droits et libert\u00e9s des citoyens, particuli\u00e8rement de la part des tribunaux et des organismes d'application de la loi, au Canada et dans le monde entier . Pour remplir sa mission, l'organisation a recours aux FIQ. La plupart des FIQ reprennent des articles provenant d'autres sources, qui sont suivis d'un \u00e9ditorial. Souvent, les \u00e9ditoriaux sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re personne et semblent \u00eatre l'\u009cuvre de M. Kyburz.\n[17] Un grand nombre des FIQ publi\u00e9s initialement portent sur les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s m\u00e9faits des Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes (7). Par exemple, le FIQ du 22 octobre 2000 renferme plusieurs articles qui sont tir\u00e9s de ce qui semble \u00eatre un site Web syrien d'actualit\u00e9s et qui traitent d'actes d'agression ou de terrorisme auxquels se serait livr\u00e9 l'\u00c9tat d'Isra\u00ebl. Ces articles sont suivis d'un \u00e9ditorial de M. Kyburz, dans lequel ce dernier explique sa compr\u00e9hension de la diff\u00e9rence entre ce qu'il appelle les Juifs du Sang dits s\u00e9farades et les Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes. Les Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes, qui selon M. Kyburz repr\u00e9sentent environ 90 % de la population juive mondiale, ne sont pas de vrais Juifs mais plut\u00f4t des individus qui ont \u00e9pous\u00e9 la religion juda\u00efque dans le courant du XIIIe si\u00e8cle.\n[18] M. Kyburz se d\u00e9fend d'\u00eatre antis\u00e9mite, affirmant que ses \u00e9crits visent \u00e0 dissiper certains pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s qu'ont certaines personnes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des Juifs . \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il \u00e9crit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJe ne suis pas anti-Juifs. J'en ai contre certaines pratiques des Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes. Ce sont eux qui sont \u00e0 l'origine de toute la violence. Ce sont eux qui sont l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment moteur des Nations Unies. Ce sont eux qui ont con\u00e7u le syst\u00e8me actuel de pr\u00eats usuraires qui est la source de tellement de difficult\u00e9s et de destruction. Ce sont eux qui ont la haute main sur les m\u00e9dias grand public qui diffusent des mensonges et des renseignements trompeurs. Ce sont eux qui contr\u00f4lent le c\u00f4t\u00e9 sale de l'industrie cin\u00e9matographique. Communisme , terrorisme , guerre et Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes sont autant de synonymes.\nEt M. Kyburz d'ajouter :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJe tiens toutefois \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter qu'il y a des Juifs honn\u00eates, m\u00eame parmi les Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes. Nous ne devons pas nous en prendre aux Juifs mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 leurs activit\u00e9s sournoises, tout en nous attachant \u00e0 d\u00e9noncer ceux qui s'adonnent \u00e0 ces bassesses. Nous devons \u00e9galement nous en prendre \u00e0 leurs laquais sans scrupule - les dirigeants gouvernementaux qui n'y pensent pas \u00e0 deux fois avant d'ex\u00e9cuter leurs projets meurtriers.\n[19] Un sentiment similaire est exprim\u00e9 dans le FIQ du 24 octobre 2000. Commentant un article intitul\u00e9 The 'English' Jew Behind the Foundation of Israel , M. Kyburz \u00e9crit :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00abN'est-il pas \u00e9tonnant que l'on d\u00e9couvre toujours que ce sont les Ashk\u00e9nazes - qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 tort de Juifs - qui sont les instigateurs des guerres. Partout o\u00f9 ils sont pr\u00e9sents, les impostures, les fourberies et les meurtres sont monnaie courante.\u00bb\n[20] Le 25 octobre 2000, M. Kyburz a publi\u00e9 un article de William Pierce intitul\u00e9 There will be Hell to pay . Ce long article est tr\u00e8s remarquable par l'attitude fielleuse manifest\u00e9e envers les Juifs. L'auteur y aborde un certain nombre de questions, notamment le trafic d'esclaves de race blanche auquel les Juifs se seraient adonn\u00e9s. Pierce affirme que l'esclavage blanc est florissant en Isra\u00ebl, o\u00f9 cette activit\u00e9 n'est pas ill\u00e9gale dans la mesure o\u00f9 les esclaves ne sont pas des Juifs. En fait, il pr\u00e9tend que l'esclavage blanc est sanctionn\u00e9 par la religion juive.\n[21] Pierce \u00e9voque \u00e9galement le r\u00f4le des Juifs dans le domaine de la pornographie juv\u00e9nile, faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement \u00e0 Moscou d'un r\u00e9seau de pornographie juv\u00e9nile, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment dirig\u00e9 par trois Juifs. Il d\u00e9crit les activit\u00e9s des pornographes en ces termes :\n[TRADUCTION]\nIl est presque impossible d'imaginer jusqu'\u00e0 quel point la pornographie juv\u00e9nile peut \u00eatre une activit\u00e9 d\u00e9go\u00fbtante. Je ne parle pas ici des vid\u00e9os montrant des filles bien roul\u00e9es de 15 ou 16 ans en train de faire l'amour. Je parle de choses tellement perverses et ignobles que la plupart des Am\u00e9ricains ont peine \u00e0 les imaginer. Je parle d'hommes film\u00e9s pendant qu'ils ont des relations sexuelles avec des fillettes de deux ou trois ans. Je parle de jeunes enfants de race blanche auxquels on inflige des s\u00e9vices sexuels et qui sont viol\u00e9s \u00e0 mort devant la cam\u00e9ra au grand plaisir de maniaques qui sont excit\u00e9s sexuellement \u00e0 la vue de telles horreurs.\n[22] Au sujet des maniaques ou, si l'on pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, des consommateurs de pornographie juv\u00e9nile, Pierce d\u00e9clare :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00abCes malades, je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9 de le dire, ne sont pas tous Juifs, mais les Juifs sont en nombre disproportionn\u00e9 parmi eux.\u00bb\n[23] Pierce explique ensuite que les m\u00e9dias am\u00e9ricains n'assurent pas la couverture de ces choses-l\u00e0, en raison de l'emprise des Juifs sur les m\u00e9dias.\n[24] Comment doit-on lutter contre ceux qui se livrent \u00e0 ces activit\u00e9s pornographiques? Selon Pierce, [TRADUCTION] ces gens-l\u00e0 devraient tout simplement \u00eatre tu\u00e9s sur-le-champ, peu importe l'endroit o\u00f9 ils se trouvent . Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9crit la mainmise des Juifs sur les m\u00e9dias, il pr\u00e9cise :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00abQui plus est, les gens qui favorisent et encouragent ce genre d'individualisme extr\u00eame, de par la supr\u00e9matie qu'ils exercent sur les m\u00e9dias, devraient tous \u00eatre carr\u00e9ment extermin\u00e9s.\u00bb\n[25] Toutefois, Pierce ne limite pas ses commentaires \u00e0 l'extermination des Juifs qui s'adonnent \u00e0 la pornographie juv\u00e9nile ou qui ont la haute main sur les m\u00e9dias. Il va jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre, en fait, que l'\u00e9limination de tous les Juifs en Russie serait justifi\u00e9e :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLes Juifs ont saign\u00e9 \u00e0 blanc la Russie au cours des 70 ann\u00e9es de r\u00e9gime marxiste. Ils ont assassin\u00e9 des dizaines de millions de Russes - les meilleurs - dans les camps de travail communistes, dans le sous-sol du quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la police secr\u00e8te ou en bordure des fosses communes am\u00e9nag\u00e9es dans les for\u00eats partout en Russie et en Ukraine; ils ont forc\u00e9 des milliers des plus belles jeunes femmes russes \u00e0 se prostituer et en ont fait des esclaves apr\u00e8s la chute du communisme; et voil\u00e0 qu'ils enl\u00e8vent maintenant des enfants russes et les violent \u00e0 mort devant la cam\u00e9ra afin de produire des films de pornographie juv\u00e9nile \u00e0 l'intention de riches occidentaux pervers. Les Juifs sont chanceux d'exercer encore une domination sur la majorit\u00e9 des stations de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et autres m\u00e9dias de masse en Russie - car si jamais le peuple russe devient vraiment conscient de ce que les Juifs lui font encore subir, il se soul\u00e8vera et les tuera, jusqu'au dernier, posant ainsi un geste tout \u00e0 fait l\u00e9gitime.\n[26] Tout en reconnaissant que ce ne sont pas tous les Juifs qui s'adonnent \u00e0 la pornographie juv\u00e9nile, Pierce pose comme postulat que tous les Juifs devraient \u00eatre tenus responsables de ces [TRADUCTION] horribles atrocit\u00e9s , \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] ceux qui ne s'adonnent pas \u00e0 la pornographie juv\u00e9nile prot\u00e8gent ceux qui le font .\n[27] Il ne semble pas que Fred Kyburz soit l'auteur de cet article; cependant, l'article 13 de la Loi n'exige pas que ce soit le cas. On est en pr\u00e9sence d'un acte discriminatoire si l'intim\u00e9 a abord\u00e9 des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3, et ce, peu importe qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le mat\u00e9riel.\n[28] Comme pour les FIQ ant\u00e9rieurs, M. Kyburz a fait suivre d'un \u00e9ditorial de son cr\u00fb l'article qu'il a publi\u00e9 sur son site Web. Quels commentaires lui inspire l'article de Pierce? Il affirme :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJ'aimerais pr\u00e9ciser que les Juifs qui s'adonnent \u00e0 ce genre d'atrocit\u00e9s ne sont pas de vrais Juifs. Il s'agit de Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes qui ont \u00e9pous\u00e9 la foi juive pour des motifs politiques, comme nous l'avons vu dans le FIQ pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. \u00c0 l'avenir, je les d\u00e9signerai simplement sous le nom d' Ashk\u00e9nazes . Ce sont des escrocs. Ce sont eux qui sont \u00e0 l'origine du communisme. Ce sont eux qui ont concoct\u00e9 les multiples fa\u00e7ons d'\u00e9c\u009curer les gens dans le monde entier. Ce sont eux qui ont con\u00e7u le syst\u00e8me de pr\u00eats usuraires afin de nous saigner \u00e0 blanc. Ce sont eux qui tiennent les r\u00eanes de l'OMS. Ce sont eux qui font la promotion des vaccins afin de nous rendre malades et d\u00e9pendants \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de leurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s pharmaceutiques. Ce sont eux qui tiennent les commandes aux Nations Unies. Il n'y a rien d'\u00e9tonnant \u00e0 ce que les Nations Unies soient une machine meurtri\u00e8re? Ce sont eux qui dictent la loi \u00e0 nos gouvernements.\nM. Kyburz termine son \u00e9ditorial avec l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 suivant :\n* Avertissement *\nSi les bons Juifs ne d\u00e9noncent pas les mauvais Juifs (les Ashk\u00e9nazes), ils sont tout aussi coupables qu'eux!\n[29] Commentant les observations formul\u00e9es \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision par un ancien agent du SCRS au sujet de groupes comme les Patriots on Guard, M. Kyburz a \u00e9crit dans son FIQ du 9 novembre 2000 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nD'abord, je vous dirai que vous \u00eates bien mal avis\u00e9 de qualifier de Juifs les meurtriers, agresseurs d'enfants, terroristes et p\u00e9dophiles. Bien qu'ils se disent Juifs, ils ne le sont pas. Ils sont Ashk\u00e9nazes. Sont-ils les fils de Satan? Je ne sais pas. Ce que je sais, c'est qu'il serait impossible que des enfants de Satan puissent commettre de pires crimes que ces gens-l\u00e0\n[30] Dans le FIQ du 17 novembre 2000, qui renferme un extrait d'un livre intitul\u00e9 Truth and Justice versus Lies and Hatred, M. Kyburz rench\u00e9rit sur l'id\u00e9e voulant que les Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes soient des escrocs. Dans l'extrait en question, on met en doute le nombre de victimes de l'holocauste durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, donnant \u00e0 entendre qu'il n'est pas de six millions, comme on le pr\u00e9tend souvent, mais plut\u00f4t de l'ordre de 200 000 \u00e0 300 000. Dans une certaine mesure, les Juifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9, selon l'auteur, les artisans de leur propre malheur :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLes mesures anti-Juifs - qu'on a qualifi\u00e9es \u00e0 tort de mesures antis\u00e9mites - pr\u00e9vues par les programmes nationaux-socialistes ont constitu\u00e9, en fait, un affront aux Juifs qui \u00e9taient loyaux \u00e0 l'\u00c9tat allemand. Le mouvement sioniste, qui s'\u00e9tend au monde entier, a pris ces mesures parce qu'elles \u00e9taient essentielles pour soutenir ses efforts pour atteindre ses propres buts. C'est pourquoi le mouvement sioniste a entretenu le climat d'affrontement entre le gouvernement du Troisi\u00e8me Reich et les Juifs \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle internationale. C'est quelque chose que nous ne sommes pas cens\u00e9s savoir aujourd'hui. Les sionistes \u00e9taient persuad\u00e9s que leurs coreligionnaires ne seraient int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 coloniser la Palestine que s'ils faisaient l'objet d'une s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation dans leur pays d'accueil. Ils se sont m\u00eame r\u00e9jouis de l'adoption des lois de Nuremberg parce que celles-ci apportaient de l'eau \u00e0 leur moulin, c.-\u00e0-d. qu'elles allaient dans le sens de leurs aspirations.\nM. Kyburz dit avoir d\u00e9cider de publier cet extrait pour d\u00e9voiler une partie de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 au sujet de l'holocauste .\n[31] Dans son FIQ du 18 novembre 2000, M. Kyburz fait suivre un article dans lequel on critique les mesures prises par les Isra\u00e9liens contre les Palestiniens durant la derni\u00e8re Intifada du commentaire ci-apr\u00e8s :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLes Ashk\u00e9nazes sont dans leur \u00e9l\u00e9ment. Ils excellent dans l'art de d\u00e9truire les biens et la vie. C'est ce qu'ils font le mieux. Ils s'adonnent \u00e0 leur art partout et chaque fois que cela leur est possible, comme ils l'ont fait au fil des si\u00e8cles.\n[32] Les observations formul\u00e9es par M. Kyburz dans son FIQ du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2000 marquent le d\u00e9but d'un virage. Les Juifs sionistes sont d\u00e9sormais mis sur le m\u00eame pied que les Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes. Selon M. Kyburz, le plan d'action des Juifs sionistes devrait \u00e9galement provoquer la consternation chez le lecteur :\n[TRADUCTION]\nMaintenant, les Khazars (8) (Juifs sionistes) qui tiennent les commandes et cr\u00e9ent les guerres pour Isra\u00ebl sont \u00e9galement les ma\u00eetres du NOI [nouvel ordre international (9)]. Pouvez-vous imaginer le sort qui vous attend, une fois que ces gens-l\u00e0 seront les ma\u00eetres absolus? N'oubliez pas que Staline \u00e9tait l'un d'eux. Il a tu\u00e9 des dizaines de millions de ses propres concitoyens. Selon certaines estimations, il en aurait extermin\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 une centaine de millions. Ces \u00eatres d\u00e9prav\u00e9s ne sont pas devenus plus civilis\u00e9s dans l'intervalle. Si on ne r\u00e9ussit pas \u00e0 les stopper, nous ferons les frais de la col\u00e8re de leur esprit d\u00e9prav\u00e9 et retors. Pour ma part, l'id\u00e9e de devenir une de leurs victimes ne m'excite pas. Et vous qu'en pensez-vous?\nDans son FIQ du 25 mars 2001, M. Kyburz, faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au FIQ du 25 octobre 2000, \u00e9crit :\n[TRADUCTION]\n[Cela] d\u00e9montre la vraie nature des Juifs sionistes. Les enl\u00e8vements d'enfants, la pornographie juv\u00e9nile, la p\u00e9dophilie, l'esclavage et les meurtres sont leur sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9. Cette sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9, ils l'exercent au sein de nos tribunaux, des universit\u00e9s, des gouvernements, de la police, de la profession m\u00e9dicale - o\u00f9 ils se sp\u00e9cialisent dans les avortements -, partout o\u00f9 ils ont la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9truire la vie.\n[33] Les FIQ subs\u00e9quents d\u00e9crivent les Juifs sionistes ou ashk\u00e9nazes comme les terroristes les plus impitoyables au monde, comme des \u00eatres non respectueux des droits, des libert\u00e9s et de la vie d'autrui (10), comme un groupe de criminels et d'assassins d\u00e9nu\u00e9s de tout scrupule, comme des sous-hommes atteints de d\u00e9mence (11), comme des gens qui tueront une grande proportion de la population mondiale si on ne les arr\u00eate pas (12).\n[34] Les commentaires de M. Kyburz ne se limitent pas toujours aux Juifs sionistes ou ashk\u00e9nazes et s'appliquent parfois \u00e0 l'ensemble des Juifs. Par exemple, dans son FIQ du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2000, il \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Les Juifs ont caus\u00e9 un tort incroyable dans le monde entier au fil des si\u00e8cles. Il s'en prend ensuite particuli\u00e8rement aux Juifs sionistes, affirmant qu'ils ne changeront jamais leurs fa\u00e7ons de faire, car ce sont :\n[TRADUCTION]\n...des escrocs, des criminels, des bellicistes, des p\u00e9dophiles, des gens qui sont contre la vie et pleins de haine Voil\u00e0 leur vraie nature. Ils ne peuvent changer et ne changeront pas. Si nous ne voulons pas qu'ils d\u00e9truisent notre civilisation, notre mode de vie, nos droits et nos libert\u00e9s, nous devrions veiller \u00e0 les \u00e9carter de la prise de d\u00e9cisions. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut \u00e9viter de les admettre dans quelque institution gouvernementale que ce soit.\n[35] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Richard Warman a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il est devenu conscient de l'existence du site Web des Patriots on Guard en mars 2001, alors qu'il s'occupait d'affaires de droits de la personne. Il a communiqu\u00e9 avec le fournisseur de services Internet de M. Kyburz afin de le sensibiliser au contenu du site. \u00c0 la suite de cette d\u00e9marche, le fournisseur en question a coup\u00e9 l'acc\u00e8s au site, puis a ferm\u00e9 celui-ci. Selon M. Warman, le site Web des Patriots on Guard a \u00e9t\u00e9 inaccessible pendant quelques jours en avril 2001 mais est redevenu accessible quelques jours plus tard par l'entremise d'un fournisseur de services diff\u00e9rent.\n[36] Les efforts faits par M. Warman pour faire fermer le site Web ne sont pas pass\u00e9s inaper\u00e7us aupr\u00e8s de M. Kyburz. Le 7 avril 2001, M. Warman a re\u00e7u un message \u00e9lectronique de quelqu'un qui s'est identifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant Fred Kyburz et dont l'adresse \u00e9lectronique \u00e9tait kyburz@telusplanet.net. Les circonstances entourant l'envoi du message, ainsi que son contenu, prouvent selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s que l'exp\u00e9diteur \u00e9tait M. Kyburz. Le message, dont copie a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise \u00e0 des douzaines d'autres destinataires, peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de diatribe contre M. Warman qui avait fait fermer le site Web des Patriots on Guard.\n[37] Lorsqu'on examine le message, on constate que M. Kyburz a tenu pour acquis que M. Warman \u00e9tait lui-m\u00eame de race juive. En fait, son venin est en grande partie dirig\u00e9 vers M. Warman et ses fr\u00e8res juifs sionistes :\n[TRADUCTION]\nVous avez le culot de me qualifier d' antis\u00e9mite ! Je ne suis PAS antis\u00e9mite - contrairement \u00e0 vous! Je suis contre la vermine, la criminalit\u00e9, les mauvais traitements envers les enfants, la pornographie juv\u00e9nile et la propagande sioniste.\nVous \u00eates un antis\u00e9mite parce que les gens de votre esp\u00e8ce ont les mains souill\u00e9es du sang de milliers de Juifs et de millions de Blancs. Vous \u00eates antis\u00e9mite, anti-Blancs et anti-droit Ne vous ai-je pas pr\u00e9venu, bande d'idiots, de mon intention de d\u00e9noncer votre plan sioniste \u00e0 vis\u00e9e communiste. Maintenant vous m'avez donn\u00e9 une bonne raison de tenir ma promesse. Je vais mettre au grand jour, vous verrez, beaucoup d'atrocit\u00e9s que les gens de votre acabit ont commises. Vous verrez qui sont les VRAIS antis\u00e9mites.\nVous qualifiez ma d\u00e9nonciation des gestes d\u00e9viants et des actes criminels des gens de votre esp\u00e8ce de haine contre un groupe identifiable (c.-\u00e0-d., en l'occurrence le peuple juif) . Il ne s'agit pas de haine de ma part; en revanche, vos fr\u00e8res sionistes manifestent, eux, une haine indicible contre des innocents (c.-\u00e0-d., les enfants de race blanche), de par leurs machinations insidieuses et meurtri\u00e8res. Je d\u00e9noncerai sous peu les motivations qui peuvent amener vos fr\u00e8res juifs sionistes \u00e0 agir ainsi. Vous pouvez hurler et crier aussi fort que vous pouvez que je suis ANTIS\u00c9MITE. Plus vous crierez fort, plus je d\u00e9noncerai vos intentions qui sont d'une bassesse r\u00e9pugnante. Allez-y. Je suis pr\u00eat pour la bataille.\n[38] M. Kyburz a ensuite commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 M. Warman dans ses FIQ. Ainsi, dans son FIQ du 5 ao\u00fbt 2001, il \u00e9crit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nN'oubliez pas que ces Juifs sont les Juifs sionistes, et particuli\u00e8rement les Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes - qui sont tous des communistes inv\u00e9t\u00e9r\u00e9s. Ce sont \u00e9galement eux qui ont la mainmise sur les m\u00e9dias dans le monde entier. Ils sont aussi bien en selle \u00e0 Hollywood. Est-il \u00e9tonnant que les nouvelles que rapportent les m\u00e9dias soient d\u00e9form\u00e9es? Est-il \u00e9tonnant qu'Hollywood ne produise que des saloperies?\nRichard Warman... [M. Kyburz \u00e9num\u00e8re ensuite les noms d'autres personnes qui se sont attir\u00e9es ses foudres]... suis-je antis\u00e9mite parce que je d\u00e9nonce ces esprits criminels et meurtriers que vous appuyez et prot\u00e9gez avec tant de ferveur?\n[39] Le FIQ du 15 d\u00e9cembre 2001 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux efforts de M. Warman pour faire fermer le site Web de M. Kyburz. Dans ce feuillet, M. Kyburz d\u00e9signe express\u00e9ment M. Warman par son nom. On trouve aussi dans le m\u00eame texte le passage suivant :\n[TRADUCTION]\nNous devons faire cesser les actions viles et basses et les incroyables atrocit\u00e9s de ces esprits mesquins. Seule une d\u00e9nonciation compl\u00e8te peut permettre de mettre fin \u00e0 ces machinations meurtri\u00e8res. Il est difficile, voire impossible, pour une personne normale de comprendre comment quelqu'un peut \u00eatre aussi m\u00e9chant. Nous ferons mieux de nous faire \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e avant que ces gens-l\u00e0 nous empoisonnent avec les vaccins et autres poisons m\u00e9dicamentaux qu'ils nous offrent.\n[40] Dans son FIQ du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2001, M. Kyburz qualifie M. Warman de mis\u00e9rable , indiquant qu'il est un laquais \u00e0 la solde du gouvernement sioniste-communiste d'Isra\u00ebl. M. Kyburz traite ensuite les gens comme M. Warman d' [TRADUCTION] \u00eatres criminels moins qu'humains qui ne reculent devant aucun crime pour atteindre leur but qui est de dominer le monde entier .\n[41] La derni\u00e8re allusion \u00e0 Richard Warman dans le site Web des Patriots on Guard est contenue dans le FIQ du 20 d\u00e9cembre 2001. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait observer que les Juifs (sionistes) sont aussi m\u00e9chants qu'ils l'ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 et qu'ils s'emploient \u00e0 fomenter des guerres dans le but d'en retirer des profits, M. Kyburz poursuit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nRichard Warman, si vous pouvez prouver que j'ai tort, sortez de votre tani\u00e8re. Envoyez-moi un message \u00e9lectronique pour me faire part de vos objections. Ne soyez pas un l\u00e2che ou un poltron. Signez votre message. Et surtout ne vous avisez pas de faire fermer \u00e0 nouveau mon site Web parce que vous n'aimez pas mon franc-parler. Si cela vous offusque que je dise la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, alors modifiez vos fa\u00e7ons d'agir et amenez vos compagnons sionistes \u00e0 faire de m\u00eame. Je sais qu'il est presque impossible pour vous de changer de caract\u00e8re. Vous \u00eates par nature vil, malhonn\u00eate et fourbe et il en est de m\u00eame de vos fr\u00e8res sionistes.\n[42] Peu apr\u00e8s l'affichage de ce message sur le Web, le site des Patriots on Guard a \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement. La preuve n'indique pas clairement si cette situation a \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat des efforts de M. Warman.\nii) Les questions abord\u00e9es dans les messages sont-elles susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3? [43] Le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Karen Mock, psychologue qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue experte en mati\u00e8re de discrimination, d'antis\u00e9mitisme, de racisme et de mat\u00e9riel haineux, a aid\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 examiner cette question. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le mat\u00e9riel publi\u00e9 sur le site Web n'avait rien de subtil ou de nuanc\u00e9; il \u00e9tait fonci\u00e8rement haineux. Toutefois, le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Mock a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 cerner certains th\u00e8mes antis\u00e9mites traditionnels \u00e9voqu\u00e9s dans les documents, notamment la notion de meurtre rituel , l'objectif all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de domination mondiale des Juifs et leur emprise manifeste sur diverses institutions (13).\n[44] Les tribunaux se sont pench\u00e9s sur la d\u00e9finition des termes hatred (haine) et contempt (m\u00e9pris) dans certaines affaires relevant de l'article 13. Dans Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor (14), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a fait siennes les d\u00e9finitions de hatred et de contempt cit\u00e9es par le tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy c. Johnston (15). Dans Nealy, le tribunal a affirm\u00e9 :\nLe terme hatred connote un ensemble d'\u00e9motions et de sentiments comportant une malice extr\u00eame envers une autre personne ou un autre groupe de personnes. Quand on dit qu'on ha\u00eft quelqu'un, c'est que l'on ne trouve aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te ses d\u00e9fauts. Toutefois, il s'agit d'un terme qui ne fait pas appel n\u00e9cessairement au processus mental de regarder quelqu'un de haut et il est fort possible de ha\u00efr quelqu'un que l'on estime sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 soi en intelligence, en richesse ou en pouvoir. Aucun des synonymes utilis\u00e9s dans le dictionnaire pour le terme hatred ne donne d'indice sur les motifs de la malice. Par contraste, contempt est un terme qui sugg\u00e8re le processus mental consistant \u00e0 regarder quelqu'un de haut ou \u00e0 le traiter comme inf\u00e9rieur.\n[45] Dans Nealy, le tribunal s'est \u00e9galement interrog\u00e9 sur le sens du mot exposer , tel qu'employ\u00e9 dans l'article 13. Citant la d\u00e9cision rendue par le tribunal initial dans Taylor, le tribunal a affirm\u00e9 dans Nealy :\nOn ne trouve pas habituellement le verbe exposer dans les lois destin\u00e9es \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la propagande haineuse. Par contre, il est dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas question, par exemple dans le R\u00e8glement d\u00e9coulant de la Loi sur la radiodiffusion, dans les dispositions de la Loi sur les postes et dans divers articles connexes du Code criminel, de propos insultants ou injurieux, ou de d\u00e9clarations qui incitent \u00e0 la haine ou la fomentent.\nLe verbe inciter veut dire attiser; fomenter signifie soutenir activement. Le verbe exposer est un terme plus passif, qui semble indiquer que la personne qui transmet le message n'a pas l'intention de susciter une r\u00e9action violente chez la personne qui le re\u00e7oit. Exposer \u00e0 la haine implique \u00e9galement un genre de communication plus subtile et indirecte que l'insulte vulgaire ou le langage injurieux non d\u00e9guis\u00e9. Le verbe exposer signifie : laisser une personne ou une chose sans protection; laisser sans abri ou d\u00e9fense; soumettre au danger, au ridicule, \u00e0 la censure, etc. En d'autres termes, si un individu cr\u00e9e les conditions propices \u00e0 la haine, laisse le groupe identifiable expos\u00e9 \u00e0 la rancune ou \u00e0 l'hostilit\u00e9, s'il le place dans une situation o\u00f9 il risque d'\u00eatre ha\u00ef, o\u00f9 la haine et le m\u00e9pris sont in\u00e9vitables, alors cet individu tombe sous le coup du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi sur les droits de la personne.\n[46] De l'avis du Tribunal, il ne fait aucun doute que les messages diffus\u00e9s sur le site Web des Patriots on Guard sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les personnes de confession juive. En s'en prenant particuli\u00e8rement aux Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes, M. Kyburz a exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des Juifs d'ascendance europ\u00e9enne en raison de leur religion ainsi que de leur origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[47] Toutefois, M. Kyburz ne s'en prend pas uniquement aux Juifs d'ascendance europ\u00e9enne. Tout en concluant que les messages exposent \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les Juifs en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et pas seulement les Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes, le Tribunal d\u00e9sire faire remarquer que m\u00eame si M. Kyburz s'acharne particuli\u00e8rement sur les Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes (16), certains de ses commentaires portent sur la soi-disant m\u00e9chancet\u00e9 et les soi-disant m\u00e9faits de l'ensemble des Juifs. En outre, M. Kyburz donne \u00e0 entendre que les non-Ashk\u00e9nazes sont complices des pr\u00e9tendues m\u00e9chancet\u00e9s des Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes. Dans un certain nombre d'articles qu'il a publi\u00e9s sur son site Web, M. Kyburz ne fait pas de distinction entre les Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes et les Juifs qui ne sont pas d'origine europ\u00e9enne.\n[48] Quand on les lit dans leur contexte, les messages publi\u00e9s sur le site Web des Patriots on Guard indiquent au lecteur que les Juifs sont fonci\u00e8rement retors et perfides et qu'ils ont un instinct meurtrier. Non seulement veulent-ils enlever, corrompre et tuer des enfants de race blanche , mais leur but ultime est de changer le monde. De tels messages ne peuvent que contribuer \u00e0 fomenter la haine contre le peuple juif. Les messages qui pr\u00e9conisent ouvertement l'extermination du peuple juif, notamment ceux que renferme l'article de Pierce, sont encore plus inqui\u00e9tants.\n[49] En outre, l'emploi par M. Kyburz de termes tels que [TRADUCTION] sous-hommes , ordures , vermines et voyous pour d\u00e9crire les juifs risque tr\u00e8s certainement d'amener certains lecteurs \u00e0 percevoir les Juifs comme des \u00eatres inf\u00e9rieurs et \u00e0 les m\u00e9priser en tant que peuple. Comme l'a fait remarquer le Dr Mock dans son t\u00e9moignage, cette tactique qui consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9shumaniser le peuple juif \u00e9tait courante dans la propagande nazie. En faisant voir les Juifs comme des \u00eatres moins qu'humains, il \u00e9tait plus facile, comme l'a expliqu\u00e9 le Dr Mock, de les tuer.\n[50] Le caract\u00e8re persuasif de ces messages est rehauss\u00e9 par le recours par M. Kyburz \u00e0 ce que le Dr Mock a qualifi\u00e9 d' approche pseudo-th\u00e9orique , ainsi qu'en t\u00e9moignent les allusions \u00e0 [TRADUCTION] l'\u00e9minent historien David Irving et \u00e0 la qu\u00eate de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 d'Ernst Zundel . Les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences aux articles publi\u00e9s par des groupes comme l'Institute for Historical Review, organisme vou\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9mythification de l'holocauste, illustrent \u00e9galement cette technique.\n[51] En ce qui concerne l'all\u00e9gation de M. Warman selon laquelle les messages de M. Kyburz constituent une discrimination contre les Juifs en raison de leur race, il convient de faire remarquer que le Dr Mock a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les Juifs n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 la m\u00eame race, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la m\u00eame religion. Nous faisons n\u00f4tre la remarque du Dr Mock selon laquelle M. Kyburz a tent\u00e9, toutefois, de racialiser les Juifs en donnant \u00e0 entendre que les divers traits de caract\u00e8re qu'il leur pr\u00eatait \u00e9taient inn\u00e9s. Ses nombreux commentaires au sujet des gens de leur esp\u00e8ce , de m\u00eame que les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 des choses comme la v\u00e9ritable nature des Juifs sionistes attestent ce fait. Le dernier FIQ illustre particuli\u00e8rement cette tactique; on y lit que les Juifs sionistes ne changeront jamais parce que ce sont [TRADUCTION] des escrocs, des criminels, des bellicistes, des p\u00e9dophiles, des gens qui sont contre la vie et pleins de haine Voil\u00e0 leur nature. Ils ne peuvent changer et ne changeront pas.\n[52] Le fait que les Juifs ne constituent pas une race n'annule pas pour autant ce volet de la plainte de M. Warman. La jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les dispositions interdisant la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif de discrimination illicite comme incluant l'interdiction d'exercer une discrimination en raison de l'appartenance per\u00e7ue au groupe prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (17). Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que les messages contenus dans le site Web des Patriots on Guard sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 la religion juive en raison de leur race per\u00e7ue, ainsi que leur religion et, dans le cas des Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes, de leur origine nationale ou ethnique.\nD. Conclusion concernant le volet de la plainte relevant de l'article 13 [53] Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 dans un des articles publi\u00e9s sur le site Web des Patriots on Guard, le droit international reconna\u00eet le droit des individus \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'opinion et d'expression. Ainsi, l'article 19 de la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l'homme (18) pr\u00e9cise que ce droit ... implique le droit de ne pas \u00eatre inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 pour ses opinions et celui de chercher, de recevoir et de r\u00e9pandre, sans consid\u00e9ration de fronti\u00e8re, les informations et les id\u00e9es par quelque moyen d'expression que ce soit .\n[54] Bien qu'il constitue l'une des pierres angulaires d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique, le droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'opinion et d'expression n'est pas un droit illimit\u00e9. Dans certains cas, la protection de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 restreint ce que peuvent dire les individus. C'est la raison pour laquelle il est ill\u00e9gal de crier Au feu! dans une salle de cin\u00e9ma remplie lorsqu'il n'y a pas d'incendie, de lancer une alerte \u00e0 la bombe ou de prof\u00e9rer des menaces de mort \u00e0 l'endroit de quelqu'un d'autre.\n[55] Dans Taylor, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a eu l'occasion d'examiner la port\u00e9e de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00e0 la lueur des principes du droit international ainsi que de la protection de la libert\u00e9 d'opinion et d'expression garantie par la Charte (19). La Cour a conclu que m\u00eame si l'article 13 portait atteinte \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'opinion et d'expression, cette atteinte \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e par l'engagement international envers l'\u00e9limination de la propagande haineuse ainsi que par celui du Canada envers les valeurs de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 et du multiculturalisme.\n[56] Ayant conclu que Fred Kyburz a abord\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, en recourant aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement, des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 la religion juive, nous estimons que le volet de la plainte de M. Warman relevant de l'article 13 est fond\u00e9.\nV. LE VOLET DE LA PLAINTE RELEVANT DE L'ARTICLE 14.1 - REPR\u00c9SAILLES A. Les soi-disant messages de repr\u00e9sailles [57] Apr\u00e8s la fermeture du site Web des Patriots on Guard, un forum de discussion en ligne des Patriots on Guard a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9. M. Warman a expliqu\u00e9 qu'un forum de discussion est un babillard \u00e9lectronique o\u00f9 les gens peuvent publier des messages et lire les messages publi\u00e9s par d'autres personnes. Le forum de discussion des Patriots on Guard \u00e9tait une tribune libre; autrement dit, n'importe qui pouvait s'y inscrire et participer aux discussions en ligne. En outre, un membre pouvait d\u00e9cider de se faire acheminer automatiquement par courrier \u00e9lectronique tout nouvel article publi\u00e9 sur le site, et ce, d\u00e8s que celui-ci y \u00e9tait affich\u00e9. M. Warman s'est inscrit au forum sous un nom fictif et, par cons\u00e9quent, a eu acc\u00e8s aux messages affich\u00e9s.\n[58] Le mat\u00e9riel affich\u00e9 sur le site du forum de discussion des Patriots on Guard est de nature similaire \u00e0 celui qui \u00e9tait publi\u00e9 sur le site Web des Patriots on Guard et comprend des messages sign\u00e9s par Fred Kyburz et exp\u00e9di\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de l'adresse \u00e9lectronique freburz@yahoo.ca. Le moment o\u00f9 le forum de discussion a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9, de m\u00eame que le nom de ce forum et les questions abord\u00e9es dans les articles affich\u00e9s, prouvent que l'instigateur est M. Kyburz. Cette conclusion est confirm\u00e9e par les messages \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9chang\u00e9s (reproduits dans l'onglet 28 de la pi\u00e8ce HR-1) dans lesquels M. Kyburz fait mention de son site Web http:\/\/www.patriotsonguard.org .\n[59] En outre, nous concluons que c'est M. Kyburz qui est l'auteur des nombreux messages affich\u00e9s sur le site du forum. Nous en sommes venus \u00e0 cette conclusion parce que nous avons constat\u00e9 que ces messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s par M. Kyburz - Fred ou Fred Kyburz . Dans beaucoup de cas, le contexte ainsi que la teneur des messages indiquent clairement que leur auteur est M. Kyburz.\n[60] Le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2002, Richard Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte initiale aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Le 26 avril 2002, M. Kyburz a affich\u00e9 les messages \u00e9lectroniques que lui et un producteur de l'\u00e9mission de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision W-5 de CTV se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s \u00e0 propos d'une \u00e9mission de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision consacr\u00e9e au mouvement anti-fisc (20). Dans les premiers messages \u00e9lectroniques, le producteur demandait \u00e0 M. Kyburz s'il serait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 participer \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission. M. Kyburz a refus\u00e9 l'offre. Apr\u00e8s la diffusion de l'\u00e9mission, M. Kyburz a fait parvenir au producteur un long message \u00e9lectronique pour lui faire part de son d\u00e9go\u00fbt, dans lequel figurait le passage suivant :\n[TRADUCTION]\nVous pouvez maintenant aller vous plaindre \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne de mon antis\u00e9mitisme, comme l'a fait votre confr\u00e8re sioniste Richard Warman, un employ\u00e9 pr\u00e9cieux de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada et du minist\u00e8re de la Justice - quelle jolie bande de lurons! La CCDP est un organisme qui se d\u00e9fend en niant la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Ces gens-l\u00e0 sont tomb\u00e9s bien bas. Ils doivent nier la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pour prot\u00e9ger leur comportement criminel. Ils ont une conscience tellement aberrante qu'ils croient au bien-fond\u00e9 de leurs propres raisonnements pervers. Richard Warman doit \u00eatre votre pr\u00e9cieux alli\u00e9\n[61] M. Kyburz reproduit ensuite une lettre qu'il dit avoir envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'honorable John Richard, juge en chef de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada, o\u00f9 M. Warman travaillait auparavant. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait \u00e9tat des d\u00e9marches faites par M. Warman pour faire fermer son site Web, ainsi que de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, M. Kyburz d\u00e9clare :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJe parle d'une foule de choses sur mon site Web. Je parle d'esclavage, de meurtres, d'activit\u00e9s terroristes, de p\u00e9dophilie, de guerre, d'imp\u00f4t, de droits inali\u00e9nables des individus, de prostitution enfantine, de pornographie juv\u00e9nile, etc. J'y ai affich\u00e9 les opinions d'autres personnes et des articles de journaux, de m\u00eame que mes propres conclusions.\nCertains articles traitent des faits et gestes de Juifs qui s'adonnent \u00e0 diverses activit\u00e9s criminelles : pornographie juv\u00e9nile, prostitution enfantine, esclavage, meurtre, g\u00e9nocide, etc. Il s'agit de crimes qui ont fait les manchettes. Warman, qui est Juif, s'offusque du fait que ses confr\u00e8res juifs et leurs activit\u00e9s diaboliques soient d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s, ce qui explique, bien s\u00fbr, sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Il approuve donc sans r\u00e9serve des crimes immondes -prostitution juv\u00e9nile, pornographie enfantine, meurtre, g\u00e9nocide, esclavage et ex\u00e9cution de gens innocents, etc. Aucun individu ayant ne serait-ce qu'une once de conscience n'appuierait ni n'approuverait des activit\u00e9s aussi atroces et indignes de la part d'un \u00eatre humain. De toute \u00e9vidence, M. Warman est d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de toute conscience\nPar cons\u00e9quent, je vous demande, Monsieur, de prendre sans tarder les mesures suivantes :\ncong\u00e9dier sur-le-champ M. Richard Warman de son poste au sein du gouvernement en lui refusant toute indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part. \u00c0 aucun moment \u00e0 l'avenir devra-t-on permettre qu'il soit r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 dans la fonction publique ou qu'il remplisse un r\u00f4le consultatif aupr\u00e8s d'un organisme gouvernemental ou d'un employ\u00e9 de l'\u00c9tat. S'il n'est pas cong\u00e9di\u00e9 sans indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part d'ici le 12 avril 2002, je d\u00e9noncerai publiquement le fait que vous approuvez sans r\u00e9serve les crimes susmentionn\u00e9s commis par des employ\u00e9s du minist\u00e8re de la Justice. Je veillerai \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce que les Canadiens soient pleinement inform\u00e9s du fait que tous les juges au Canada approuvent les crimes pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s (\u00e0 moins qu'un juge ne d\u00e9montre clairement par les d\u00e9cisions qu'il rend qu'il n'approuve pas ces crimes et que ses d\u00e9cisions sont vraiment fond\u00e9es sur les lois du pays .) ordonner \u00e0 M. Richard Warman de m'\u00e9crire une lettre d'excuses; ordonner que M. Richard Warman demande \u00e0 mon fournisseur de services ant\u00e9rieur (Rackspace) de r\u00e9activer mon site Web sur celui David Icke (21); faire cesser sans tarder l'enqu\u00eate que m\u00e8ne la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e0 mon sujet et \u00e0 propos de mon site Web.\n[62] La lettre au juge en chef indique qu'une copie sera transmise \u00e0 tous les d\u00e9put\u00e9s et s\u00e9nateurs. M. Kyburz demande \u00e9galement aux lecteurs d'\u00e9crire au juge en chef [TRADUCTION] pour lui dire leur fa\u00e7on de penser . Rien dans la documentation dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi n'indique que le juge en chef Richard ait jamais r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre de M. Kyburz, et rien n'indique non plus que M. Warman ait subi des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9favorables \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de l'exp\u00e9dition par M. Kyburz de cette lettre au juge en chef.\n[63] Dans un message affich\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement, M. Kyburz reproduit certaines lettres \u00e9chang\u00e9es dans le cadre de l'enqu\u00eate de la Commission sur la plainte de M. Warman. Commentant l'une des lettres de M. Warman, M. Kyburz \u00e9crit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nM. Warman, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que vous lisez religieusement chaque mot que j'\u00e9cris, je ne vois pas le besoin de vous faire tenir copie du pr\u00e9sent message. Je suis s\u00fbr que vous en prendrez connaissance. Je veillerai \u00e0 ce que tous les d\u00e9put\u00e9s et s\u00e9nateurs, de m\u00eame que le juge en chef de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada et tous les membres de la Commission, en re\u00e7oivent copie. J'en enverrai \u00e9galement une copie \u00e0 bien d'autres gens. J'ose croire que l'id\u00e9e de devenir c\u00e9l\u00e8bre est loin de vous d\u00e9plaire. Mais vous vous en remettrez. Beaucoup de gens se familiariseront avec le nom de Richard Warman et tout ce qu'il connote. Vous devez \u00eatre aux oiseaux!\nLa libert\u00e9 de parole est quelque chose de non existant ou d'interdit lorsqu'il est question des atrocit\u00e9s commises par les Juifs et les sionistes. Cependant, lorsqu'on parle des atrocit\u00e9s des NAZIS, personne ne peut m\u00eame poser une question. L'hypocrisie semble un mode de vie chez vous et vos confr\u00e8res sionistes. M. Warman, sachez que pour toute personne \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e, vous avez l'air d'un minable. Ce qui est bon pour vous est interdit \u00e0 tous les autres. Ce que vous et vos confr\u00e8res sionistes faites toute la journ\u00e9e, les autres ne peuvent le faire. Vous semblez avoir fait de la discrimination votre mode de vie\nPauvre idiot. Vous pleurez comme un b\u00e9b\u00e9 qui s'ennuie de sa m\u00e8re. Pensez-vous que je devrais endurer sans mot dire vos abus, vos tactiques terroristes \u00e0 mon endroit, vos escroqueries, vos mensonges, vos man\u009cuvres d'intimidation, vos menaces, votre fourberie, votre comportement immonde \u00e0 mon endroit? Ne pensez pas que je vais me laisser faire b\u00eatement! Vous avez commenc\u00e9 cette bataille; c'est pas le temps pour vous de vous d\u00e9filer. Montrez-nous de quel bois vous vous chauffez. Je d\u00e9teste avoir \u00e0 faire \u00e0 des poltrons. Vous aurez vite fait de constater que le panier de crabes que vous avez ouvert le restera longtemps. Vous allez vous retrouver avec une poursuite judiciaire sur les bras bient\u00f4t - trop t\u00f4t \u00e0 votre go\u00fbt! Peut-\u00eatre serez-vous confront\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs poursuites. Cela sera de la petite bi\u00e8re comparativement \u00e0 la campagne de publicit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle vous aurez droit si vous ne faites pas r\u00e9activer par Rackspace mon site Web ainsi que celui de David Icke avant que la pub ne soit diffus\u00e9e (22)\nSi les membres de la Commission poursuivent leur enqu\u00eate \u00e0 mon sujet, ils auront droit au m\u00eame traitement que celui que je vous r\u00e9serve. Vous ne perdez certes rien pour attendre. Pr\u00e9parez-vous et sachez que je ne suis pas le seul \u00e0 \u00e9prouver un profond d\u00e9go\u00fbt face \u00e0 votre comportement criminel. [Soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[64] Dans le message subs\u00e9quent, le menaces de M. Kyburz \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Warman deviennent encore plus explicites. Il affirme :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJ'ai appris aujourd'hui m\u00eame que M. Richard Warman aura \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des accusations de libelle et d'extorsion d'ici la fin d'ao\u00fbt. Je d\u00e9poserai moi-m\u00eame de telles accusations si cette enqu\u00eate sur moi et mon site Web n'est pas interrompue sans tarder et si M. Warman ne r\u00e9active pas mon site Web aupr\u00e8s de Rackspace ainsi que le site Web de David Icke. Si je d\u00e9cide moi aussi d'emprunter cette voie, M. Warman ne sera pas le seul d\u00e9fendeur. Tous les membres de la Commission, de m\u00eame que vous-m\u00eame [M. Kyburz mentionne ensuite les noms de deux employ\u00e9s de la Commission], serez nomm\u00e9s dans la poursuite. Toutefois, ce sera le cadet de vos soucis. Les d\u00e9pliants vous causeront plus de maux de t\u00eate que les poursuites en justice. Il y aura une avalanche de d\u00e9pliants. Les d\u00e9pliants peuvent ruiner votre carri\u00e8re professionnelle ainsi que votre vie. Ce n'est pas une menace, mais bien un avertissement et un avis raisonnable que je donne \u00e0 vous tous. Des juges et des agents de police ont vu leur carri\u00e8re, de m\u00eame que la vie de leur famille, \u00eatre grandement boulevers\u00e9es, voire d\u00e9truites. N'oubliez pas, messieurs dames, que le crime ne paie pas. Les accusations mensong\u00e8res que portent les vrais coupables contre les gens qui tentent de r\u00e9pandre la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ne seront pas tol\u00e9r\u00e9es plus longtemps.\nJe vous ai servi maints avertissements. Mon intention n'est pas de d\u00e9truire la vie ou la carri\u00e8re de qui que ce soit. Cependant, les gens qui ne respectent pas les lois du pays devront payer le prix de leur violation irresponsable des droits et libert\u00e9s que les individus ont en vertu de la common law. Laissez-moi vous dire une chose : le crime ne paie pas et il faudra mettre un terme \u00e0 une carri\u00e8re fond\u00e9e sur la criminalit\u00e9.\nLe message est sign\u00e9 Ernst-Friedrich Kyburz . Il y est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'une copie a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise aux d\u00e9put\u00e9s et s\u00e9nateurs, aux d\u00e9put\u00e9s de l'Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative de l'Alberta, au juge en chef Richard, aux membres de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et \u00e0 [TRADUCTION] bien d'autres personnes .\n[65] Dans le message du 11 juin 2002, M. Kyburz reproduit un article du National Post d\u00e9crivant les mesures prises par Transports Canada en r\u00e9action \u00e0 la menace terroriste. Apr\u00e8s avoir comment\u00e9 ce qu'il d\u00e9crit comme les actes criminels du gouvernement, M. Kyburz ajoute : [TRADUCTION] Je me demande si cette id\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 concoct\u00e9e par Richard Warman ou quelqu'un du m\u00eame acabit? Ces gens-l\u00e0 sont vraiment obs\u00e9d\u00e9s et ne cherchent qu'\u00e0 restreindre la libert\u00e9 partout. Terrorisme, meurtre et g\u00e9nocide, voil\u00e0 leurs sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s Apr\u00e8s avoir qualifi\u00e9 M. Warman de terroriste, M. Kyburz poursuit :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00abNous devons faire tout en notre pouvoir pour d\u00e9barrasser le Canada des terroristes.\u00bb\n[66] Les articles subs\u00e9quents publi\u00e9s par M. Kyburz renferment de nombreuses allusions \u00e0 Richard Warman, dont certaines se pr\u00e9sentent sous la forme de commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants qui, souvent, ont rapport \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e appartenance \u00e0 la religion juive. D'autres prennent davantage la forme de menaces implicites. C'est le cas notamment du commentaire voulant que Richard Warman ait [TRADUCTION] g\u00e2ch\u00e9 son avenir . Dans certains articles de discussion, les menaces sont plus directes. Par exemple, l'article du 22 juillet comporte une farce \u00e0 propos des avocats - transmise \u00e0 M. Warman afin d' [TRADUCTION] \u00e9gayer sa journ\u00e9e . M. Kyburz fournit l'explication suivante : [TRADUCTION] Je sais que vous \u00eates d\u00e9prim\u00e9 \u00e0 la perspective du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'accusations criminelles contre vous ainsi que de la diffusion de d\u00e9pliants au sujet de votre excellente r\u00e9putation. Le 1er ao\u00fbt 2002, M. Kyburz \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Richard Warman, nous vous avons vu \u00e0 travers votre jeu ainsi que votre racket diabolique. Pr\u00e9parez-vous : le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne d'action-r\u00e9action a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clench\u00e9.\n[67] Six jours plus tard, M. Kyburz a publi\u00e9 un reportage au sujet du d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'un agent de police appel\u00e9 Eric Taylor, dans lequel on all\u00e8gue que ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 abattu par un certain Don Matthews qui, pr\u00e9cise-t-on, \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident de la National Constitutional Academy, [TRADUCTION] un groupe qui croit que la police n'a pas le pouvoir de faire appliquer la loi . Apr\u00e8s avoir affirm\u00e9 qu'il [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9teste toute forme de violence , M. Kyburz affirme :\n[TRADUCTION]\nQue font les gens lorsqu'ils se sentent traqu\u00e9s et ne voient pas d'issue? Que feront-ils lorsqu'ils s'apercevront qu'on porte atteinte jour apr\u00e8s jour \u00e0 leurs droits et libert\u00e9s, qu'on leur ment effront\u00e9ment et qu'on d\u00e9forme les lois du pays afin que tous et chacun soient asservis par les organismes gouvernementaux, y compris les tribunaux et la police?\nEst-ce que les gens au sein de ces organismes gouvernementaux pensent vraiment qu'ils peuvent commettre de telles exactions sans coup f\u00e9rir? Pensent-ils vraiment que les gens attendront b\u00eatement d'\u00eatre abattus et n'opposeront pas de r\u00e9sistance? J'ai bien peur que beaucoup de gens feront comme Don Matthews : ils aligneront un de ces ap\u00f4tres du nouvel ordre international dans leur mire, puis appuieront sur la g\u00e2chette.\nEh bien! M. Richard Warman, sachez qu'un certain nombre de gens vous ont bien \u00e0 l'\u009cil, comme vous vous en doutez bien. Les gens ont cess\u00e9 de prendre \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re vos abus, vos menaces, vos mensonges et vos comportements sans scrupule. Ceci n'est pas une menace, mais bien un avertissement dont vous voudrez bien tenir compte avant que vous n'ayez plus d'ennuis que vous en avez d\u00e9j\u00e0. Les ennemis que vous vous \u00eates fait ne sont pas dupes de vos tactiques sionistes. Vous ne r\u00e9ussirez pas \u00e0 les garder sous votre coupe, et ce, m\u00eame avec l'aide de vos confr\u00e8res sionistes. Ils se noieront eux-m\u00eames dans le lisier de porc dans lequel ils ont tent\u00e9 d'entra\u00eener le monde entier.\nB. Les messages non divulgu\u00e9s [68] La documentation d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve devant le Tribunal comprend un certain nombre de messages affich\u00e9s sur le site Web du forum des Patriots on Guard peu avant la date pr\u00e9vue du d\u00e9but de l'audience. L'avocate de la Commission a demand\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser en preuve cette documentation, m\u00eame si elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Kyburz avant l'audience, comme l'exigent les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal. Le Tribunal a autoris\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de celle-ci, tout en r\u00e9servant sa d\u00e9cision quant au poids qu'il conviendrait de lui attribuer, compte tenu du fait qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Kyburz avant l'audience.\n[69] La non-divulgation des documents pose un dilemme int\u00e9ressant au Tribunal. Les obligations que les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal imposent aux parties en mati\u00e8re de divulgation visent \u00e0 faire en sorte que chaque partie connaisse la preuve qu'il lui faudra r\u00e9futer \u00e0 l'audience. Dans le cas de la partie intim\u00e9e, la divulgation pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'audience permet \u00e9galement de prendre conscience de toute l'\u00e9tendue des all\u00e9gations dont elle fait l'objet et d'\u00e9valuer ainsi son degr\u00e9 d'exposition possible.\n[70] En l'esp\u00e8ce, m\u00eame si on pourrait soutenir que M. Kyburz n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de l'intention de la Commission de citer les plus r\u00e9cents messages qu'il a publi\u00e9s, M. Warman a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa plainte que l'acte discriminatoire rev\u00eatait un caract\u00e8re continu. En outre, si M. Kyburz avait comparu \u00e0 l'audience, le Tribunal aurait vraisemblablement autoris\u00e9 la Commission \u00e0 produire les preuves suppl\u00e9mentaires, car M. Kyburz aurait eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que les documents en question le prenait de court ou lui causaient un pr\u00e9judice quelconque puisque c'est lui qui semble en \u00eatre l'auteur. Cela soul\u00e8ve la question \u00e0 savoir si l'on devrait permettre que la partie intim\u00e9e soit dans une position plus avantageuse en refusant de participer \u00e0 une audience du Tribunal que celle dans laquelle elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si elle avait comparu.\n[71] Cependant, il n'est point n\u00e9cessaire que cette question ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e. Les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires n'ajoutent pas grand-chose \u00e0 la plainte, si ce n'est qu'ils contribuent \u00e0 illustrer davantage le genre de messages que nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9crits.\nC. Analyse du volet de la plainte concernant les repr\u00e9sailles [72] Il ne fait aucun doute que M. Kyburz a exerc\u00e9 et menac\u00e9 d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Warman parce que celui-ci avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en vertu de l'article 13.\n[73] L'exemple le plus flagrant de repr\u00e9sailles est la lettre que M. Kyburz a apparemment fait parvenir au juge en chef Richard en vue de faire cong\u00e9dier M. Warman de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada. L'\u00e9chec apparent de la tentative de M. Kyburz est sans importance : le seul fait pour la partie intim\u00e9e de tenter de faire du tort \u00e0 la partie plaignante parce que celle-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte constitue une infraction \u00e0 l'article 14.1 (23). En faisant parvenir une copie de sa lettre \u00e0 de nombreuses autres personnes, M. Kyburz avait, de toute \u00e9vidence, l'intention de ternir le plus possible la r\u00e9putation de M. Warman.\n[74] Les menaces de mort dont M. Warman a fait l'objet sont encore plus inqui\u00e9tantes. La crainte manifeste exprim\u00e9e par M. Kyburz, selon laquelle quelqu'un pourrait aligner l'un de ces ap\u00f4tres du nouvel ordre international dans sa mire et appuyer sur la g\u00e2chette, juste apr\u00e8s qu'il eut mentionn\u00e9 qu'on avait pris acte des activit\u00e9s de M. Warman, peut \u00eatre raisonnablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme un avertissement voil\u00e9 que la vie de ce dernier \u00e9tait en danger. De m\u00eame, la d\u00e9claration contenue dans le message du 11 juin 2002 qui associait M. Warman au terrorisme, suivie de l'exhortation \u00e0 faire tout en son pouvoir pour d\u00e9barrasser le Canada des terroristes, peut \u00eatre raisonnablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme une menace pesant sur la vie de M. Warman.\n[75] S'ajoutent \u00e0 cela les menaces non \u00e9quivoques et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es consistant \u00e0 orchestrer contre M. Warman une campagne de publicit\u00e9 dans le but avou\u00e9 de ruiner sa carri\u00e8re et sa vie, ainsi que les nombreuses attaques verbales \u00e0 son endroit ainsi que contre sa r\u00e9putation et les motifs sous-jacents au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[76] Bien que M. Kyburz ait fait des allusions \u00e0 M. Warman sur le site Web du forum en raison de ses efforts pour faire fermer le site Web des Patriots on Guard, avant qu'il ne d\u00e9pose sa plainte devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, la teneur et la fr\u00e9quence de ses commentaires ont chang\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de celle-ci. Les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 M. Warman sont devenues plus fr\u00e9quentes mais aussi plus virulentes. Beaucoup de messages faisaient directement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la plainte de M. Warman ou \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate de la Commission. Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9, d'autres messages comprenaient diverses formes de menace \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Warman. Il est \u00e9vident que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans l'escalade de la campagne men\u00e9e par M. Kyburz contre M. Warman. Cela montre clairement qu'il y a eu contravention \u00e0 l'article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne; par cons\u00e9quent, ce volet de la plainte de M. Warman est lui aussi maintenu.\n[77] Avant d'en finir avec la question des repr\u00e9sailles, il convient de noter que M. Warman a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il croyait que M. Kyburz avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des accusations criminelles dont il avait fait l'objet. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, cela \u00e9quivaudrait tr\u00e8s certainement \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles. Toutefois, la preuve documentaire qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e permet vraiment de douter que M. Kyburz ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'origine du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces accusations (24). M\u00eame s'il est fort probable que M. Kyburz ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu au courant de la situation en ce qui touche les accusations criminelles, il semble que celles-ci aient dans les faits \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par deux autres personnes qui trouvaient elles-m\u00eames \u00e0 redire aux activit\u00e9s de M. Warman. Au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve dont nous disposons \u00e0 ce sujet, nous ne sommes pas persuad\u00e9s que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des accusations criminelles dont M. Warman a fait l'objet constituaient des repr\u00e9sailles de la part de M. Kyburz en raison de la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 13. Cependant, M. Kyburz a bel et bien menac\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser lui-m\u00eame des accusations criminelles contre M. Warman, ce qui, dans ce contexte, constitue un autre exemple de repr\u00e9sailles.\nVI. L'AVIS DE DROIT D'AUTEUR [78] Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, M. Kyburz a fait parvenir au Tribunal un avis de droit d'auteur concernant le nom d'Ernst-Friedrich Kyburz. Toutefois, M. Kyburz n'a fourni au Tribunal aucune explication quant au but de cette initiative. Qu'il suffise de dire que le fait d'exp\u00e9dier un avis de droit d'auteur ne peut emp\u00eacher quelqu'un d'\u00eatre jug\u00e9 coupable d'une infraction \u00e0 une loi comme la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nVII. LES MESURES DE REDRESSEMENT [79] Ayant jug\u00e9 que les deux volets de la plainte de M. Warman relevant respectivement de l'article 13 et de l'article 14.1 sont fond\u00e9s, il nous reste \u00e0 nous prononcer sur un dernier point, soit les mesures de redressement. Les articles 13 et 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voient chacun des mesures de redressement diff\u00e9rentes; par cons\u00e9quent, chaque plainte sera trait\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9ment en ce qui touche les mesures de redressement \u00e0 adopter.\nA. Le volet de la plainte relevant de l'article 13 i) Ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir [80] Dans les cas o\u00f9 il juge qu'une plainte relevant de l'article 13 est fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal est habilit\u00e9, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) de la Loi, \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire et \u00e0 prendre, en consultation avec la Commission, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables.\n[81] Les communications Internet posent un d\u00e9fi particulier au Tribunal lorsqu'il s'agit de concevoir une mesure de redressement efficace. La nature unique de la technologie Internet, y compris les difficult\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'existence de multiples juridictions du fait que le cyberespace n'a pas de fronti\u00e8res, ainsi que la mobilit\u00e9 des cibles en raison du recours \u00e0 des sites miroirs, soul\u00e8vent des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes quant \u00e0 l'efficacit\u00e9 des ordonnances de cesser et de s'abstenir de diffuser des messages haineux par Internet.\n[82] En d\u00e9pit de ces restrictions, une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir, tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 par le Tribunal dans Z\u00fcndel, peut avoir des cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 la fois pratiques et symboliques. Du point de vue pratique, une telle ordonnance devrait emp\u00eacher la partie intim\u00e9e de continuer de communiquer du mat\u00e9riel semblable \u00e0 celui d\u00e9crit dans cette d\u00e9cision. En outre, la d\u00e9nonciation publique des actes qui ont fait l'objet du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte par M. Warman en vertu de l'article 13 rev\u00eat une importante valeur symbolique. Nous faisons n\u00f4tre l'observation du Tribunal dans Z\u00fcndel, \u00e0 savoir que le Parlement, au nom de tous les Canadiens, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne saurait tol\u00e9rer la diffusion de messages haineux par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. [ ] les victimes de haine ont droit \u00e0 l'avantage que constitue le plein poids de [l']autorit\u00e9 [du Tribunal] .\n[83] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne que Fred Kyburz et toute autre personne agissant de concert avec lui mettent fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire qui consiste \u00e0 utiliser ou \u00e0 faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement, pour aborder ou faire aborder des questions comme celles dont il est fait \u00e9tat dans les pi\u00e8ces HR-1 et HR-2, ou d'autres questions de nature essentiellement similaire, qui sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris une ou plusieurs personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3, acte qui va \u00e0 l'encontre du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il convient de pr\u00e9ciser par souci de clart\u00e9 que M. Kyburz doit, en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, cesser de faire de la publicit\u00e9 au sujet du mat\u00e9riel diffus\u00e9 sur le site Web des Patriots on Guard qui est maintenant affich\u00e9 sur le site Web Archive.org, ou de renvoyer d'autres internautes \u00e0 celui-ci.\n[84] Bien que le volet de la plainte de M. Warman relevant de l'article 13 concerne le site Web des Patriots on Guard, il est \u00e9vident que, depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, M. Kyburz a utilis\u00e9 le site Web du forum des Patriots on Guard comme moyen de transmettre ses messages haineux. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'ordonnance du Tribunal s'applique \u00e9galement au mat\u00e9riel affich\u00e9 sur le site Web du forum. Comme il faudra un certain temps pour d\u00e9manteler le site Web du forum, le Tribunal ordonne que M. Kyburz ferme le site en question dans les sept jours qui suivront la signification de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Cette disposition ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme autorisant M. Kyburz \u00e0 dire ce qu'il veut dans l'intervalle. \u00c0 cette fin, le Tribunal ordonne que M. Kyburz cesse et s'abstienne de publier de nouveaux messages Internet du genre de ceux vis\u00e9s par le volet de la plainte relevant de l'article 13, que ce soit sur le site Web du forum des Patriots on Guard ou ailleurs sur Internet, d\u00e8s que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal lui aura \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e.\n[85] La Commission a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal ordonne que sa d\u00e9cision soit signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Kyburz par la poste prioritaire et par courrier \u00e9lectronique. Compte tenu des tr\u00e8s graves cons\u00e9quences que risquerait d'entra\u00eener pour M. Kyburz le non-respect de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal est d'avis qu'il n'est pas opportun de rendre une telle ordonnance. En outre, comme c'est la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui est charg\u00e9e de l'ex\u00e9cution des ordonnances du TCDP, nous sommes d'avis qu'il ne serait pas acceptable que ce Tribunal cherche \u00e0 dicter \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ce qui constituerait un avis suffisant \u00e0 M. Kyburz, dans le cas o\u00f9 il faudrait recourir \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure d'ex\u00e9cution.\n[86] La Commission a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 M. Kyburz de communiquer avec Archive.org afin de faire supprimer le mat\u00e9riel publi\u00e9 sur le site Web des Patriots on Guard. Nous avons des pr\u00e9occupations quant au caract\u00e8re ex\u00e9cutoire d'une telle ordonnance. Pareille demande exigerait selon toute vraisemblance une explication de M. Kyburz quant aux raisons pour lesquelles il demande la suppression du mat\u00e9riel. Cela pourrait obliger M. Kyburz \u00e0 dire quelque chose qui \u00e0 son avis ne correspond pas \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, ce qui, selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, pose probl\u00e8me (Stevenson c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (25)). En outre, si les efforts de M. Kyburz devaient se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler vains, on pourrait mettre en doute subs\u00e9quemment la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 de sa demande, ce qui impliquerait le genre d'\u00e9valuation subjective qui pourrait rendre l'ex\u00e9cution difficile. Il nous semble qu'une demande de la Commission \u00e0 Archive.org, accompagn\u00e9e d'un exemplaire de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, serait beaucoup plus susceptible de donner des r\u00e9sultats; par cons\u00e9quent, nous refusons de rendre l'ordonnance demand\u00e9e. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d'une autorisation en ce sens dans la Loi, le Tribunal ne peut rendre une ordonnance contre un tiers. Cependant, nous encourageons les propri\u00e9taires du site Web Archive.org \u00e0 songer s\u00e9rieusement \u00e0 supprimer le mat\u00e9riel offensant que renferme leur site.\nii) Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [87] Dans les cas o\u00f9 la victime est express\u00e9ment nomm\u00e9e dans les messages qui constituent l'acte discriminatoire aux termes de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) de la Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de verser une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pouvant atteindre 20 000 $. L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) int\u00e8gre par renvoi le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, qui pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer une telle indemnit\u00e9 s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que ... l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 .\n[88] Lorsqu'on \u00e9value s'il est opportun de rendre en l'esp\u00e8ce une telle ordonnance, il ne faut pas oublier que l'acte discriminatoire dont il s'agit est la diffusion de messages haineux, en contravention de l'article 13 de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, les seuls messages litigieux pour l'instant sont ceux vis\u00e9s par le volet de la plainte de M. Warman relevant de l'article 13, \u00e0 savoir les messages publi\u00e9s sur le site Web des Patriots on Guard. Bien que le message \u00e9lectronique de M. Kyburz \u00e0 M. Warman ainsi que les messages publi\u00e9s dans le site Web du forum des Patriots on Guard soient pertinents par rapport aux mesures de redressement \u00e0 prendre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la contravention \u00e0 l'article 14.1, nous n'avons pas tenu compte de ces messages aux fins des mesures de redressement relevant de l'article 13.\n[89] C'est \u00e0 la suite des efforts de M. Warman pour faire fermer son site que M. Kyburz a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement allusion \u00e0 M. Warman et \u00e0 le d\u00e9signer par son nom dans les messages publi\u00e9s sur le site Web des Patriots on Guard. Les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 M. Warman, qui sont remarquables par leur virulence, \u00e9taient motiv\u00e9es, du moins en partie, par la perception de M. Kyburz voulant que M. Warman soit lui-m\u00eame Juif. Cela correspond \u00e0 une tendance qui se r\u00e9p\u00e8te dans les messages Web de M. Kyburz : d\u00e8s que quelqu'un s'oppose \u00e0 ses vues, cette personne est aussit\u00f4t assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 la conspiration juive mondiale.\n[90] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Warman a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas Juif. \u00c0 notre avis, le fait que M. Warman ne soit pas lui-m\u00eame Juif n'att\u00e9nue en rien le caract\u00e8re haineux des attaques dont il a fait l'objet de la part de M. Kyburz. Ces attaques \u00e9taient de toute \u00e9vidence motiv\u00e9es, du moins en partie, par la perception de M. Kyburz voulant que M. Warman soit Juif. Fort de cette croyance, M. Kyburz a attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Warman des traits de caract\u00e8re tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gatifs ainsi qu'un comportement criminel. M. Warman a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s vex\u00e9 par cette fa\u00e7on d'agir, ce que nous trouvons fort compr\u00e9hensible. \u00c0 notre avis, M. Warman est une victime de l'acte discriminatoire.\n[91] Le comportement de M. Kyburz \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. \u00c0 notre avis, M. Warman a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 appr\u00e9ciable \u00e0 ce titre. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal accorde \u00e0 M. Warman la somme de 15 000 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) de la Loi.\niii) Int\u00e9r\u00eats [92] Les sanctions non p\u00e9cuniaires impos\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne donnent droit au paiement d'int\u00e9r\u00eats (26). Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, les sommes d'argent consenties \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciales conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision donnent droit au paiement d'int\u00e9r\u00eats. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats courront \u00e0 compter de la date de cette d\u00e9cision, et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 la date du paiement. Cependant, la somme totale vers\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, y compris les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne peut en aucun cas \u00eatre sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 20 000 $ (27).\niv) Sanction p\u00e9cuniaire [93] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) de la Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e, dans le cas d'une plainte relevant de l'article 13, de verser en guise de sanction p\u00e9cuniaire une somme pouvant atteindre 10 000 $. L'inclusion de cette disposition dans les modifications de 1998 \u00e0 la Loi repr\u00e9sente une rupture importante par rapport \u00e0 l'approche traditionnelle voulant que les d\u00e9dommagements dans les affaires de droits de la personne visent d'abord et avant tout \u00e0 redresser plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 punir. Jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant, aucune ordonnance n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par le Tribunal en vertu de cette disposition.\n[94] Les indemnit\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciales accord\u00e9es en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des plaintes relevant de l'article 13 visent \u00e0 indemniser les personnes express\u00e9ment nomm\u00e9es dans les messages haineux. Par contraste, les sanctions p\u00e9cuniaires impos\u00e9es en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) de la Loi se veulent l'expression de l'opprobre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du comportement de la partie intim\u00e9e (28).\n[95] Afin de d\u00e9cider s'il y a lieu d'imposer \u00e0 M. Kyburz une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire en l'esp\u00e8ce, le l\u00e9gislateur a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que nous devions tenir compte de plusieurs facteurs, notamment de la nature et de la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que des circonstances l'entourant , ainsi que de la nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte, des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de son auteur et de sa capacit\u00e9 de payer (29) . Nous examinerons chacun de ces facteurs \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\n[96] En ce qui concerne la nature et la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que les circonstances l'entourant, nous avons conclu que M. Kyburz a communiqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e des messages m\u00e9chants, vicieux et radicaux au sujet des Juifs. Non seulement ces messages ont-ils attribu\u00e9 des actes criminels multiples et vari\u00e9s aux adeptes de la foi juive, qu'ils ont d\u00e9crits comme des \u00eatres fonci\u00e8rement corrompus et d\u00e9viants, mais certains d'entre eux sont all\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00f4ner l'extermination pure et simple des Juifs comme groupe. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment milite fortement en faveur de l'imposition d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire importante.\n[97] Nous avons conclu que M. Kyburz \u00e9tait responsable des messages communiqu\u00e9s au moyen du site Web des Patriots on Guard. Il est \u00e9vident, compte tenu des messages proprement dits, qu'il a communiqu\u00e9 cette information en connaissance de cause, sachant qu'elle bouleverserait beaucoup de gens. Toutefois, au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal, rien n'indique que M. Kyburz se soit adonn\u00e9 auparavant \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires, ce qui constitue une circonstance att\u00e9nuante.\n[98] Le dernier \u00e9l\u00e9ment que doit examiner le Tribunal est la capacit\u00e9 de M. Kyburz de payer une indemnit\u00e9 tenant lieu de sanction p\u00e9cuniaire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, nous faisons observer que les seuls renseignements dont nous disposons \u00e0 ce sujet est la d\u00e9claration non asserment\u00e9e qu'on retrouve dans un des messages publi\u00e9s par M. Kyburz sur le Web, \u00e0 savoir qu'il est sans le sou (30). Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocate de la Commission a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il n'incombe pas \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9montrer que M. Kyburz a les moyens de payer, mais que le fardeau de la preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard appartient \u00e0 ce dernier, puisque c'est surtout lui qui sait ce qui en est.\n[99] La position de la Commission est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par au moins quelques pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Dans R. v. Noseworthy (31), la Cour d'appel de Terre-Neuve s'est pench\u00e9e sur la question du fardeau de la preuve par rapport \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de payer d'un individu, faisant remarquer ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nDans le cours ordinaire d'une instance, il appartient \u00e0 la partie qui invoque ou fait valoir une circonstance particuli\u00e8re de produire la preuve n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'appui. Vu la pr\u00e9somption d'innocence, la situation est diff\u00e9rente dans un proc\u00e8s criminel. C'est \u00e0 la Couronne qu'il incombe du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin de d\u00e9montrer, au-del\u00e0 de tout doute raisonnable, tous les faits n\u00e9cessaires pour conclure \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 de l'accus\u00e9. Toutefois, la pr\u00e9somption d'innocence prend fin au moment o\u00f9 le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance conclut que l'accus\u00e9 est coupable de l'infraction dont il est inculp\u00e9. \u00c0 compter de ce moment-l\u00e0, toute th\u00e8se qui est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ou soutenue est examin\u00e9e au regard du principe normal selon lequel il incombe \u00e0 la partie qui invoque ou fait valoir une circonstance de fait de produire les preuves n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'appui.\n[100] Il convient de noter que les observations de la Cour dans Noseworthy ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es dans le contexte du droit criminel. La Cour a fait observer que le Code criminel n'impose pas au juge de premi\u00e8re instance l'obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de faire enqu\u00eate sur la capacit\u00e9 de payer de l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9, sauf dans certaines circonstances. Par contraste, le paragraphe 54(1.1) pr\u00e9cise que le Tribunal doit tenir compte de la capacit\u00e9 de payer de la partie intim\u00e9e avant d'imposer une amende. Cela dit, nous sommes d'avis que les observations de la Cour au sujet du fardeau de la preuve concernant la capacit\u00e9 de payer de l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 s'appliquent \u00e9galement \u00e0 nos d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations aux termes de cette disposition de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[101] D'apr\u00e8s certains t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce, qui n'ont cependant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis sous serment et qui n'ont pas donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un contre-interrogatoire, M. Kyburz a peut-\u00eatre certaines ressources. Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite, nous ne pouvons \u00e0 notre avis y attribuer beaucoup de poids, bien que nous l'ayons examin\u00e9e. Nous avons \u00e9galement tenu compte du fait qu'il s'agit, de toute \u00e9vidence, d'une premi\u00e8re infraction commise par M. Kyburz. M\u00eame si la gravit\u00e9 du manquement \u00e0 l'article 13 justifierait sans doute l'imposition de la peine maximale pr\u00e9vue par la loi ou d'une peine se rapprochant de celle-ci, ces facteurs ont persuad\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'il conviendrait d'imposer une sanction un peu moins s\u00e9v\u00e8re. Au regard de l'ensemble des circonstances \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 54(1.1), nous ordonnons \u00e0 M. Kyburz de verser la somme de 7 500 $ en guise de sanction p\u00e9cuniaire.\n[102] Le paiement doit \u00eatre fait par ch\u00e8que vis\u00e9 ou mandat-poste \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l'ordre du Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Le Tribunal doit recevoir le paiement dans les 35 jours qui suivront la signification de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision \u00e0 M. Kyburz.\nB. Le volet de la plainte relevant du paragraphe 14.1 i) Ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir [103] Les recours \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des infractions \u00e0 l'article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sont r\u00e9gis par l'article 53 de la Loi. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de cesser de s'adonner \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire, s'il le juge \u00e0 propos.\n[104] Nous ordonnons \u00e0 M. Kyburz de cesser et de s'abstenir d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Warman parce qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Cette ordonnance s'applique aux actes de repr\u00e9sailles, y compris, mais non de fa\u00e7on limitative, les messages \u00e9lectroniques et les messages publi\u00e9s sur le Web, qu'il s'agisse du site Web du forum des Patriots on Guard ou ailleurs sur Internet, qui sont similaires au mat\u00e9riel que renferment les pi\u00e8ces HR-1 et HR-2. En outre, nous ordonnons \u00e0 M. Kyburz de cesser de menacer M. Warman ou de tenter de nuire \u00e0 sa carri\u00e8re, par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'Internet ou par un autre moyen.\n[105] Contrairement \u00e0 ce qui est le cas pour le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement du site Web du forum, qui exige certains gestes concrets de la part de M. Kyburz, nous ne voyons aucune raison de retarder la prise d'effet de ce volet de notre ordonnance. Nous enjoignons M. Kyburz de cesser d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles d\u00e8s qu'il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\nii) Indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral [106] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner le versement d'une somme pouvant atteindre 20 000 $ en guise d'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 la victime de l'acte discriminatoire qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral par suite de l'acte discriminatoire. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission demande que Richard Warman b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de l'indemnit\u00e9 maximale pr\u00e9vue par la Loi.\n[107] Certes, les actes de repr\u00e9sailles pos\u00e9s par M. Kyburz en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s graves. M. Kyburz a non seulement vitup\u00e9r\u00e9 publiquement et de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e contre M. Warman, mais il semble avoir activement tent\u00e9 de nuire \u00e0 son emploi, allant jusqu'\u00e0 demander qu'il soit cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Les menaces voil\u00e9es prof\u00e9r\u00e9es par M. Kyburz \u00e0 la vie de M. Warman sont encore plus troublantes.\n[108] Il est clairement ressorti du t\u00e9moignage de M. Warman qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 quelque peu secou\u00e9 par ses exp\u00e9riences avec M. Kyburz. M. Warman a dit craindre pour sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9, ainsi que pour celle de ses proches. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit dans son t\u00e9moignage les cons\u00e9quences que les actes de repr\u00e9sailles commis par M. Kyburz ont eues sur sa vie quotidienne, ainsi que les mesures qu'il a jug\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires de prendre pour sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9, dont l'intervention de la police.\n[109] Cela dit, le Tribunal estime que M. Warman n'est pas une personne qui se laisse abattre. De toute \u00e9vidence, il s'\u00e9tait en quelque sorte donn\u00e9 comme mission d'emp\u00eacher des gens comme M. Kyburz de propager leur haine sur le Web. Il semble que le fait que M. Warman ait \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu de la justesse de sa cause ait contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 le prot\u00e9ger quelque peu contre les effets n\u00e9gatifs que les actes de M. Kyburz auraient pu avoir sur une personne plus vuln\u00e9rable. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, nous notons que nous n'avons \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis d'aucune preuve, m\u00e9dicale ou autre, indiquant que les faits et gestes de M. Kyburz ont eu des r\u00e9percussions sur la sant\u00e9 de M. Warman.\n[110] Au regard de l'ensemble des circonstances, nous sommes d'avis qu'il convient d'ordonner le versement \u00e0 M. Warman d'une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral de 15 000 $.\niii) Int\u00e9r\u00eats [111] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral qui doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Warman pour compenser le pr\u00e9judice moral dont il a souffert donne droit au versement d'int\u00e9r\u00eats. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats courront \u00e0 compter de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 la date du paiement. Cependant, l'indemnit\u00e9 totale qui peut \u00eatre vers\u00e9e au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral, y compris les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne peut d\u00e9passer 20 000 $ (32).\niv) Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [112] Bien que le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi permette d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en cas d'infraction au paragraphe 14.1, nous n'accordons pas d'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce titre en l'esp\u00e8ce, aucune demande en ce sens n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nVIII. L'ORDONNANCE [113] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, nous d\u00e9clarons que Fred Kyburz a port\u00e9 atteinte aux droits de M. Warman aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et nous ordonnons, en ce qui touche l'infraction \u00e0 l'article 13 :\nque Fred Kyburz et toute autre personne agissant de concert avec lui mettent fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire qui consiste \u00e0 utiliser ou \u00e0 faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement, pour aborder ou faire aborder des questions comme celles dont il est fait \u00e9tat dans les pi\u00e8ces HR-1 et HR-2 ou d'autres questions de nature essentiellement similaire qui sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3, acte qui va \u00e0 l'encontre du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cette ordonnance exige notamment que M. Kyburz cesse de faire de la publicit\u00e9 au sujet du mat\u00e9riel diffus\u00e9 sur le site Web des Patriots on Guard, qui est maintenant affich\u00e9 sur le site Web Archive.org, ou de renvoyer d'autres internautes \u00e0 celui-ci; que l'on accorde \u00e0 M. Kyburz un d\u00e9lai de sept jours \u00e0 compter de la date de signification de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal pour fermer le site Web du forum des Patriots on Guard. En outre, le Tribunal ordonne que M. Kyburz cesse et s'abstienne de publier de nouveaux messages Internet du genre de ceux vis\u00e9s par le volet de la plainte relevant de l'article 13, que ce soit sur le site Web du forum des Patriots on Guard ou ailleurs sur Internet, d\u00e8s que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal lui aura \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e; que M. Kyburz verse \u00e0 M. Warman la somme de 15 000 $ en guise d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) de la Loi; que des int\u00e9r\u00eats soient vers\u00e9s sur la somme accord\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Warman en guise d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats courront \u00e0 compter de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 la date du paiement. Toutefois, la somme totale vers\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, y compris les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne peut d\u00e9passer 20 000 $; que M. Kyburz verse une somme de 7 500 $ \u00e0 titre de sanction p\u00e9cuniaire. Le paiement doit \u00eatre fait au moyen d'un ch\u00e8que vis\u00e9 ou d'un mandat-poste \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l'ordre du Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Le Tribunal doit recevoir le paiement dans les 35 jours qui suivront la signification de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision \u00e0 M. Kyburz.\nEn ce qui concerne l'infraction au paragraphe 14.1, le Tribunal ordonne :\nque, d\u00e8s qu'il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, M. Kyburz cesse et s'abstienne d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Warman parce qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Cette ordonnance s'applique \u00e0 la diffusion de messages \u00e9lectroniques et de messages Internet - sur le site Web du forum des Patriots on Guard ou ailleurs sur Internet - qui sont similaires au mat\u00e9riel que renferment les pi\u00e8ces HR-1 et HR-2. En outre, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 M. Kyburz de cesser de menacer M. Warman ou de tenter de nuire \u00e0 sa carri\u00e8re; que M. Kyburz verse \u00e0 M. Warman la somme de 15 000 $ pour compenser le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'il a subi; que des int\u00e9r\u00eats soient pay\u00e9s sur la somme qui sera vers\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Warman en guise d'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats courront \u00e0 compter de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 la date du paiement. Cependant, le montant total qui sera vers\u00e9 en guise d'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral, y compris les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne peut d\u00e9passer 20 000 $.\n\u00ab Originale sign\u00e9e par \u00bb\nAnne L.

Kyburz a d\u00e9fini les Khazars comme le groupe d'Europ\u00e9ens de la fin du Moyen \u00c2ge qui ont \u00e9pous\u00e9 la foi juive et sont devenus les Juifs ashk\u00e9nazes.\n9. 9 Le Dr Mock a expliqu\u00e9 que le nouvel ordre international est un terme quelque peu m\u00e9prisant utilis\u00e9 pour d\u00e9crire la nouvelle r\u00e9partition du pouvoir que les forces juives seraient en train de r\u00e9aliser.\n10. 10 Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet 20.\n11. 11 Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet 21.\n12. 12 Pi\u00e8ce HR-1, onglet 22.\n13. 13 On trouve dans le mat\u00e9riel un certain nombre d'all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles les Juifs exercent leur emprise sur les m\u00e9dias, les tribunaux, la police, les Nations Unies, les \u00e9coles et universit\u00e9s, l'industrie du divertissement, le syst\u00e8me bancaire, les \u00c9tats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique, le gouvernement du Canada, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s pharmaceutiques, la profession m\u00e9dicale et les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s internationales.\n14. 14 [1990] 3 R.C.S. 893.\n15. 15 (1989), 10 C.H.R.R.

Kyburz s'est brouill\u00e9 et qui consisterait \u00e0 distribuer dans le quartier qu'habite la personne cibl\u00e9e des d\u00e9pliants relatant les m\u00e9faits qu'elle aurait commis.\n23. 23 Il convient de noter que rien n'indique que la lettre destin\u00e9e au juge en chef Richard ait vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9e, si ce n'est la d\u00e9claration non solennelle de M.

Warman et d'autres personnes la verraient. M. Kyburz avait, de toute \u00e9vidence, l'intention de vexer M.

Le d\u00e9saccord porte plut\u00f4t sur la question \u00e0 savoir si les documents r\u00e9pondent aux crit\u00e8res en question.\nI. PRIVIL\u00c8GE DES COMMUNICATIONS LI\u00c9ES \u00c0 UN LITIGE [5] En ce qui concerne les communications li\u00e9es \u00e0 un litige, Bell doit satisfaire aux crit\u00e8res suivants pour qu'une revendication de privil\u00e8ge soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e :\nla communication doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'un litige; la communication doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans le but principal d'obtenir des conseils juridiques ou de faciliter le d\u00e9roulement de l'instance; l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'un litige doit \u00eatre raisonnable.\n[6] Bell a fait observer, en ce qui touche les documents concernant les emplois du SCEP (1490, 1493, 1500, 1501, 1732), qu'il n'y avait pas \u00e0 proprement parler de litige entre Bell et le SCEP au moment o\u00f9 ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s. Les plaintes syst\u00e9miques du SCEP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en 1994. Cependant, selon Bell, on pouvait raisonnablement pr\u00e9voir qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de parvenir \u00e0 une entente pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart salarial, le SCEP pr\u00e9senterait des plaintes \u00e0 la Commission.\n[7] En ce qui concerne le document de l'ACET no 1746, la Commission, au moment o\u00f9 ce document a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de plaintes de la part de certains membres de l'ACET et ainsi que de plaintes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par l'ACET au nom de certains groupes. Dans ce cas-l\u00e0, Bell soutient qu'il existait un litige non encore r\u00e9gl\u00e9 entre Bell et l'ACET ou qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 tout le moins raisonnable de pr\u00e9voir qu'il y aurait litige, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'une entente pour combler l'\u00e9cart salarial.\n[8] Le Tribunal est d'avis que Bell n'a pas satisfait \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, nous estimons que le but principal de la cr\u00e9ation de ces documents n'\u00e9tait pas d'obtenir des conseils juridiques ou de faciliter le d\u00e9roulement de l'instance. Les faits d\u00e9montrent plut\u00f4t que les documents en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s afin de d\u00e9terminer l'\u00e9tendue de l'\u00e9cart salarial \u00e0 la lueur des r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9tude mixte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la direction de Bell, \u00e0 l'ACET et au SCEP. Les r\u00e9sultats devaient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par le comit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de chaque partie en vue de combler l'\u00e9cart salarial r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 par l'\u00e9tude mixte.\nII. PRIVIL\u00c8GE D\u00c9COULANT D'UN R\u00c8GLEMENT [9] Pour qu'un privil\u00e8ge d\u00e9coulant d'un r\u00e8glement puisse s'appliquer, il incombe \u00e0 la partie qui invoque un tel privil\u00e8ge de d\u00e9montrer :\nqu'un diff\u00e9rend litigieux existe ou est anticip\u00e9; que la communication est faite dans le but, avou\u00e9 express\u00e9ment ou non, que son contenu ne soit pas d\u00e9voil\u00e9 au tribunal en cas d'\u00e9chec des n\u00e9gociations; que la communication a pour but de favoriser un r\u00e8glement.\n[10] Bell revendique un privil\u00e8ge d\u00e9coulant d'un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des documents de l'ACET nos 1752, 1753 et 1787. Bell a toujours adopt\u00e9 la position que les r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9tude conjointe devaient \u00eatre mis \u00e0 la disposition du comit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de chaque partie. Tout \u00e9cart salarial r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 par l'\u00e9tude mixte devait \u00eatre combl\u00e9 \u00e0 la faveur des n\u00e9gociations collectives. Nous avons conclu que les documents de l'ACET pour lesquels Bell revendique un privil\u00e8ge d\u00e9coulant d'un r\u00e8glement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis dans ce contexte, et non afin de favoriser le r\u00e8glement d'un diff\u00e9rend litigieux. \u00c0 notre avis, le processus de n\u00e9gociation collective qu'envisageaient les parties n'\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 des n\u00e9gociations aff\u00e9rentes \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement.\nIII. PRIVIL\u00c8GE DE N\u00c9GOCIATION COLLECTIVE [11] La Commission et le SCEP ont contest\u00e9 l'existence d'un privil\u00e8ge de n\u00e9gociation collective en droit canadien. Toutefois, si l'on reconna\u00eet qu'il existe un tel privil\u00e8ge, toutes les parties ont convenu que, pour qu'il puisse s'appliquer, chacun des quatre crit\u00e8res Wigmore doit \u00eatre satisfait :\nles communications doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises confidentiellement; le caract\u00e8re confidentiel doit \u00eatre un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel au maintien de la relation dans le cadre de laquelle les communications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises; la relation est de la nature de celle qui, selon l'opinion de la collectivit\u00e9, doivent \u00eatre entretenues assid\u00fbment; la cour doit se demander si le pr\u00e9judice que causerait \u00e0 la relation la divulgation des communications serait plus consid\u00e9rable que l'avantage \u00e0 retirer de l'obtention de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et d'une juste d\u00e9cision.\n[12] Sur la foi de notre examen de ces documents (c.-\u00e0-d. les documents nos 1484, 1490, 1493, 1494, 1495, 1498, 1500, 1501, 1732, 1746, 1752, 1753 et 1787), nous avons conclu que seul le document no 1484 satisfait \u00e0 l'ensemble des crit\u00e8res Wigmore.\n[13] Le document no 1484 est une note de service interne que Mich\u00e8le Boyer, du Groupe de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale de Bell, a exp\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 Diane Long, l'agent n\u00e9gociateur en chef de la compagnie. Essentiellement, cette note en date du 16 mars 1992 traite des diverses strat\u00e9gies de Bell par rapport aux questions de parit\u00e9 salariale dans le contexte de la n\u00e9gociation collective.\n[14] Les documents nos 1490, 1500, 1501, 1732, 1746 et 1787 renferment des tableaux et graphiques ayant rapport \u00e0 divers sc\u00e9narios d'attribution de co\u00fbts, dont certains ont rapport \u00e0 des emplois du SCEP et d'autres, \u00e0 des emplois de l'ACET. Il y est fait mention de taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en vigueur \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes dates. Les tableaux et graphiques qu'on trouve dans les documents nos 1490, 1500, 1732, 1746 et 1787 sont tr\u00e8s similaires \u00e0 ceux que comportent les pi\u00e8ces HR-76 et HR-73. En ce qui concerne les sc\u00e9narios d'attribution de co\u00fbts pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le document no 1501, ils sont identiques \u00e0 ceux qui sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans la pi\u00e8ce HR-76 (pages 1247, 1249 et 1251).\n[15] Le document no 1493 expose un sc\u00e9nario d'attribution de co\u00fbts qui indique le total des versements que Bell aurait \u00e0 faire au titre de la parit\u00e9 salariale, compte tenu des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en vigueur le 1er juin 1993, tels qu'ils figurent \u00e0 la page 1244 de la pi\u00e8ce HR-76 indiquant les \u00e9carts entre les courbes salariales. Le document no 1752 compare la courbe salariale des hommes avec celle des femmes et indique, pour les 98 emplois rep\u00e8res, l'\u00e9cart salarial en pourcentage et en chiffres absolus au 25 novembre 1992, calcul\u00e9 encore une fois en fonction des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration figurant \u00e0 la page 1244 de la pi\u00e8ce HR-76.\n[16] Le document no 1753 est semblable au document no 1752, si ce n'est que les \u00e9carts salariaux sont ceux qui existaient le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1992 plut\u00f4t que le 25 novembre 1992.\n[17] \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re page du document no 1494, on \u00e9num\u00e8re les emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation du SCEP pour lesquels un rajustement est n\u00e9cessaire. \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me page, on trouve un tableau qui indique le co\u00fbt total des rajustements de parit\u00e9 salariale des employ\u00e9s du SCEP pour 1993 dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'une augmentation de 0,919 % pour les emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine.\n[18] \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re page du document no 1495, on indique le total des employ\u00e9s du SCEP, \u00e0 l'exclusion des \u00e9tudiants, au 31 d\u00e9cembre 1992 et au 30 juin 1993, et on pr\u00e9sente les calculs. \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me page, on trouve un tableau qui indique le co\u00fbt total des rajustements de parit\u00e9 salariale des employ\u00e9s du SCEP pour 1993 dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'une augmentation de 1 % pour les emplois rep\u00e8res \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine.\n[19] Les documents nos 1494 et 1495 pr\u00e9sentent des sc\u00e9narios d'attribution de co\u00fbts fond\u00e9s sur les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration figurant \u00e0 la page 11 du document no 1490 et \u00e0 la page 1244 de la pi\u00e8ce HR-76.\n[20] La premi\u00e8re page du document no 1498 est identique \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re page du document no 1495. \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me page, on indique le total - inscrit \u00e0 la main - des employ\u00e9s du SCEP, y compris les \u00e9tudiants, en juin 1993 et d\u00e9cembre 1992.\n[21] En supposant que Bell ait satisfait aux trois premiers crit\u00e8res Wigmore, notre examen des documents mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus r\u00e9v\u00e8le que ceux-ci sont identiques, tr\u00e8s similaires ou \u00e9troitement apparent\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux d\u00e9j\u00e0 soumis en preuve. Une fois les int\u00e9r\u00eats mis en \u00e9quilibre conform\u00e9ment au quatri\u00e8me crit\u00e8re Wigmore, nous concluons qu'il est dans les meilleurs int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice de produire ces documents.\nIV. REVENDICATION PAR LE SCEP D'UN PRIVIL\u00c8GE D\u00c9COULANT D'UN R\u00c8GLEMENT [22] Les documents nos 21, 53 et 83 mentionn\u00e9s dans la liste du SCEP (annexe 3) sont des notes manuscrites r\u00e9dig\u00e9es par Patricia Blackstaffe. Le document no 21 comporte deux pages et est dat\u00e9 du 11 octobre 1994. Le document no 53 compte quatre pages et porte la date du 24 mai 1994. Le document no 83 a 17 pages et est dat\u00e9 du 14 avril 1994.\n[23] Nous avons examin\u00e9 ces documents. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des plaintes syst\u00e9miques par le SCEP et dans le contexte de la m\u00e9diation. Il existait un litige au moment de leur cr\u00e9ation. Il y est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que leur contenu ne serait pas divulgu\u00e9 en l'absence de r\u00e8glement. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous concluons que les documents nos 21, 53 et 83 sont privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s.\nV. RATIFICATION D'UNE ENTENTE [24] Apr\u00e8s discussion, les parties se sont entendues sur les conditions de divulgation ou de production de certains documents \u00e9tablis par Bell qui comportent des calculs et des estimations quant aux \u00e9carts salariaux au cours d'une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Les documents qui sont vis\u00e9s par cette entente et les conditions de celle-ci sont mentionn\u00e9es dans la pi\u00e8ce T-5. Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que la pi\u00e8ce T-5 fait partie de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision et r\u00e9sout de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante les questions de production et de privil\u00e8ge li\u00e9s \u00e0 ces pr\u00e9occupations particuli\u00e8res.\nOriginale sign\u00e9e par\nJ.

L\u2019ORDONNANCE\n[1] Durant sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi de pr\u00e8s de neuf ans comme chauffeur d\u2019autobus \u00e0 la Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d\u2019Ottawa-Carleton (OC Transpo), Francine Desormeaux s\u2019absentait fr\u00e9quemment de son travail. Ses absences \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 divers probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 : migraines, calculs r\u00e9naux, troubles de la v\u00e9sicule biliaire, kystes ovariens, virus, fracture \u00e0 la cheville, blessure au dos, bronchite, stress, etc. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u de nombreux avertissements de son employeur, Mme Desormeaux a vu OC Transpo mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison de son absent\u00e9isme involontaire chronique. Mme Desormeaux all\u00e8gue que cette cessation d\u2019emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience qui va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des dispositions de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nI. L\u2019EMPLOI DE Mme DESORMEAUX CHEZ OC TRANSPO [2] Apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 un certain nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es comme superviseure dans un centre de soins pour enfants, Francine Desormeaux est entr\u00e9e au service d\u2019OC Transpo en mars 1989 \u00e0 titre de chauffeur d\u2019autobus. OC Transpo offre des services de transport en commun dans la r\u00e9gion de la capitale nationale.\n[3] Mme Desormeaux a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait travers\u00e9 une p\u00e9riode d\u2019adaptation, car elle avait d\u00fb se familiariser avec le m\u00e9tier de chauffeur d\u2019autobus. Travailler au sein d\u2019un organisme de transports en commun pr\u00e9sente un certain nombre de d\u00e9fis aux nouveaux employ\u00e9s, qui doivent s\u2019habituer \u00e0 traiter avec le public, s\u2019orienter dans la ville et conduire des v\u00e9hicules de grande dimension. \u00c0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9s ayant le moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, les nouveaux chauffeurs se voient par ailleurs attribuer les postes les moins attrayants, notamment les postes fractionn\u00e9s, ainsi que les postes de nuit ou de week-end.\n[4] Malgr\u00e9 ces d\u00e9fis, Mme Desormeaux a termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s sa p\u00e9riode probatoire et conduit des autobus chez OC Transpo pendant un certain nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es sans aucun incident majeur. Il semble que, mis \u00e0 part le probl\u00e8me de ses absences fr\u00e9quentes du travail, Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait un bon chauffeur d\u2019autobus. De toute \u00e9vidence, elle aimait \u00eatre en contact avec le public et \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement per\u00e7ue comme une employ\u00e9e comp\u00e9tente et fiable. Toutefois, son niveau d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 pour son employeur, OC Transpo, un sujet de pr\u00e9occupation d\u00e8s le tout d\u00e9but pour ainsi dire.\nA.

En vertu de cette entente, le coll\u00e8gue en question se pr\u00e9sentait au travail \u00e0 la place de Mme Desormeaux. Cette derni\u00e8re le r\u00e9mun\u00e9rait elle-m\u00eame pour sa journ\u00e9e de travail. Mme Desormeaux estime que ce coll\u00e8gue l\u2019aurait ainsi remplac\u00e9 \u00e0 trois ou quatre occasions. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que cette pratique allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des politiques d\u2019OC Transpo.\nB. Comment OC Transpo a\u2011t\u2011elle r\u00e9agi \u00e0 l\u2019absent\u00e9isme de Mme Desormeaux? [7] De toute \u00e9vidence, il est important pour OC Transpo, qui offre des services de transport en commun \u00e0 d\u00e9lai d\u2019ex\u00e9cution critique, que ses employ\u00e9s fassent preuve d\u2019assiduit\u00e9. Afin de g\u00e9rer l\u2019absent\u00e9isme de ses employ\u00e9s, OC Transpo s\u2019est dot\u00e9e au fil du temps d\u2019un certain nombre de politiques de gestion des pr\u00e9sences.\n[8] Ron Marcotte \u00e9tait le superviseur de Mme Desormeaux au moment o\u00f9 OC Transpo a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours des premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es d\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux chez OC Transpo, les probl\u00e8mes d\u2019absent\u00e9isme \u00e9taient trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que les autres probl\u00e8mes de rendement, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire comme des questions disciplinaires. Les employ\u00e9s qui manquaient d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 faisaient l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires progressives allant de la r\u00e9primande au cong\u00e9diement. Ce traitement de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme involontaire chronique en tant que question disciplinaire est \u00e9vident lorsqu\u2019on regarde la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019absent\u00e9isme de Mme Desormeaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9r\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de sa carri\u00e8re.\n[9] Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 ci\u2011haut, l\u2019absent\u00e9isme de Mme Desormeaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 un sujet de pr\u00e9occupation pour OC Transpo \u00e0 compter du moment o\u00f9 elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au sein de l\u2019organisation. Le 27 octobre 1989, Mme Desormeaux a rencontr\u00e9 Chris Walton, qui \u00e9tait l\u2019agent des relations (exploitation) et son superviseur, dans le cadre de son \u00e9valuation faisant suite \u00e0 sa p\u00e9riode probatoire. Le document d\u2019\u00e9valuation indique que le rendement de Mme Desormeaux, son absent\u00e9isme mis \u00e0 part, ne posait pas probl\u00e8me. En octobre 1989, Mme Desormeaux s\u2019\u00e9tait absent\u00e9e du travail \u00e0 20 reprises (journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes ou parties de journ\u00e9e). Selon le document, M. Walton a discut\u00e9 avec Mme Desormeaux de son assiduit\u00e9 au cours de la rencontre.\n[10] Selon la documentation, M. Walton aurait dit \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1990 qu\u2019on envisageait s\u00e9rieusement de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. \u00c0 cette occasion, et lors de rencontres subs\u00e9quentes, Mme Desormeaux a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Walton l\u2019assurance que son dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 s\u2019am\u00e9liorerait.\n[11] En avril 1990, la fiche de Mme Desormeaux faisait \u00e9tat de 13 absences (journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes ou parties de journ\u00e9e) \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 37 jours. M. Walton a rencontr\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau Mme Desormeaux afin de discuter avec elle de son niveau d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 insatisfaisant. Au moment o\u00f9 il a inform\u00e9 Mme Desormeaux de la tenue de la rencontre, M. Walton lui a fait la remarque suivante : Compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 du probl\u00e8me, on prendra une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 votre emploi futur. Mme Desormeaux a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9voqu\u00e9 les difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 s\u2019adapter \u00e0 son travail chez OC Transpo. Elle a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Walton de ses migraines et autres probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 les pr\u00e9occupations d\u2019OC Transpo, Mme Desormeaux a termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s sa p\u00e9riode de probation et obtenu sa permanence. Toutefois, on lui a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019on suivrait de pr\u00e8s son dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9.\n[12] Trois mois plus tard, Mme Desormeaux s\u2019est vu infliger une suspension d\u2019une journ\u00e9e en raison de son absent\u00e9isme, et parce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eal\u00e9e \u00e0 un l\u00e9ger accident. Cette suspension a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une autre rencontre avec M. Walton, o\u00f9 Mme Desormeaux a fait \u00e9tat \u00e0 nouveau de ses migraines. \u00c0 cette occasion, Mme Desormeaux a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Walton de ses probl\u00e8mes de v\u00e9sicule biliaire tout en lui indiquant qu\u2019il lui faudrait probablement subir une intervention chirurgicale. Mme Desormeaux a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief par suite de sa suspension, dans lequel elle a fait valoir que la plupart de ses absences \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 la maladie. Au cours de l\u2019audition de son grief au premier palier, le syndicat de Mme Desormeaux a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que cette derni\u00e8re souffrait de migraines aigu\u00ebs, qu\u2019elle se faisait traiter par un m\u00e9decin \u00e0 ce sujet et que toutes ses consultations m\u00e9dicales avaient eu lieu en dehors des heures de travail. Un repr\u00e9sentant d\u2019OC Transpo a expliqu\u00e9 que les absences fr\u00e9quentes de Mme Desormeaux cr\u00e9aient des difficult\u00e9s du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas toujours suffisamment de personnel pour la remplacer. Ron Marcotte, qui \u00e9tait alors surintendant adjoint du personnel des autobus, \u00e9tait lui aussi pr\u00e9sent lors de la r\u00e9union concernant le grief. On peut lire dans ses notes le passage ci\u2011apr\u00e8s :\n[TRADUCTION]\nOn a inform\u00e9 Mme Desormeaux qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la responsable de la situation. On lui a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que diverses options s\u2019offraient \u00e0 elle chez OC Transpo, si elle avait besoin d\u2019aide. On a soulign\u00e9 le fait que la Commission ne cherchait pas \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la remettre sur le droit chemin.\nIl semble que la seule solution mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux relativement \u00e0 l\u2019aide offerte au sein d\u2019OC Transpo ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le programme d\u2019aide aux employ\u00e9s (PAE).\n[13] On a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 le grief en disant qu\u2019on songerait \u00e0 r\u00e9duire la suspension si Mme Desormeaux ne s\u2019absentait pas du travail \u00e0 plus de cinq reprises ou pendant plus de 12 jours au cours des 12 mois suivants et n\u2019avait pas d\u2019autres accidents dont elle serait responsable. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Desormeaux, M. Walton lui aurait alors dit qu\u2019il lui faudrait prendre tous les moyens voulus pour se pr\u00e9senter au travail. On reconnaissait que Mme Desormeaux pourrait devoir subir une intervention chirurgicale pour ses calculs biliaires et on lui a donn\u00e9 instruction de communiquer avec M. Walton pour prendre des dispositions \u00e0 propos de cette absence.\n[14] Il convient de noter que c\u2019est la seule fois durant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux chez OC Transpo qu\u2019on lui a fix\u00e9 un objectif pr\u00e9cis en mati\u00e8re d\u2019assiduit\u00e9. Mme Desormeaux a atteint cet objectif, bien que, selon ses dires, elle se soit parfois pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au travail alors qu\u2019elle prenait des comprim\u00e9s de Tylenol 3. Le Tylenol 3 renferme de la cod\u00e9ine et est, par cons\u00e9quent, contre-indiqu\u00e9 en cas de conduite automobile.\n[15] Mme Desormeaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9e en entrevue au sujet de son assiduit\u00e9 le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1992, puis \u00e0 nouveau le 20 juillet 1993. On ne sait pas grand-chose de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 lors de ces rencontres.\n[16] Le 19 juin 1994, la politique d\u2019OC Transpo concernant l\u2019emploi de personnes handicap\u00e9es est entr\u00e9e en vigueur. Cette politique, qui impliquait l\u2019abandon du recours \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure disciplinaire dans le cas des absences pour cause de maladie, \u00e9tablissait un protocole pour l\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019accommodement. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que bien que cette politique soit demeur\u00e9e en vigueur durant une couple d\u2019ann\u00e9es, la situation de Mme Desormeaux n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 celle\u2011ci, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que personne ne la consid\u00e9rait comme une handicap\u00e9e et que l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9e ne se percevait pas ainsi elle non plus.\n[17] Le 11 juillet 1994, Mme Desormeaux a rencontr\u00e9 son superviseur, Ron Marcotte, qui avait alors succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Walton. Cette rencontre avait pour but de discuter de son [TRADUCTION] niveau d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 inacceptable . Selon la documentation r\u00e9dig\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, Mme Desormeaux a inform\u00e9 M. Marcotte que ses absences avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es principalement par ses migraines et les probl\u00e8mes personnels qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. M. Marcotte lui a signal\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau qu\u2019elle pourrait faire l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res si son degr\u00e9 d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 ne s\u2019am\u00e9liorait pas et lui a encore une fois conseill\u00e9 de demander l\u2019aide du PAE.\n[18] Le 6 d\u00e9cembre 1995, M. Marcotte a eu une nouvelle rencontre avec Mme Desormeaux pour discuter de son assiduit\u00e9. Le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical de Mme Desormeaux, Rob Vye, a lui aussi assist\u00e9 \u00e0 cette rencontre. M. Marcotte a fait remarquer que si l\u2019on excluait les cong\u00e9s pris par Mme Desormeaux pour des blessures indemnisables, son dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait quelque peu am\u00e9lior\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, il a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux que son niveau d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait toujours pas acceptable et que si la situation ne s\u2019am\u00e9liorait pas, il faudrait d\u00e9terminer si elle \u00e9tait apte du point de vue m\u00e9dical \u00e0 continuer de travailler. Mme Desormeaux et M. Marcotte ont eu un autre entretien similaire le 29 ao\u00fbt 1996.\n[19] En novembre 1996, OC Transpo a adopt\u00e9 sa nouvelle politique de gestion des pr\u00e9sences. Cette politique visait notamment \u00e0 r\u00e9duire l\u2019absent\u00e9isme tout en faisant tout ce qui \u00e9tait raisonnablement possible pour venir en aide aux employ\u00e9s, tenir compte de leurs besoins et assurer leur r\u00e9adaptation, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 indiquer clairement et honn\u00eatement les attentes de l\u2019employeur en mati\u00e8re d\u2019assiduit\u00e9. Par ailleurs, elle exigeait que le superviseur, en cas de blessure ou de maladie, v\u00e9rifie aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un m\u00e9decin consultant ind\u00e9pendant si l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et devait faire l\u2019objet de mesures d\u2019adaptation. En outre, le superviseur devait tenter d\u2019amener les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 s\u2019entendre sur un [TRADUCTION] niveau d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 raisonnable pour l\u2019avenir, ce qui donnait \u00e0 croire que le taux moyen d\u2019absent\u00e9isme de l\u2019organisation \u00e9tait une norme raisonnable. L\u2019article 8 de la politique pr\u00e9cisait qu\u2019avant de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi d\u2019une personne pour absent\u00e9isme involontaire chronique, OC Transpo devait \u00eatre persuad\u00e9e, entre autres, qu\u2019on avait fait des efforts honn\u00eates pour composer avec l\u2019employ\u00e9 concern\u00e9.\n[20] Cette politique de gestion des pr\u00e9sences reposait sur une approche plus proactive de la gestion de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme des employ\u00e9s que celle qui l\u2019avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette approche, on a communiqu\u00e9 avec les employ\u00e9s qui se classaient dans la tranche sup\u00e9rieure de 25 % de l\u2019effectif d\u2019OC Transpo au chapitre de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme. Un grand nombre de ces employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9s en entrevue afin d\u2019examiner avec eux la situation. Dans le cadre de cet exercice, OC Transpo a inform\u00e9 en mars 1997 les chauffeurs concern\u00e9s, y compris Mme Desormeaux, que le taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme pour les premiers mois de 1997 \u00e9tait en hausse de 30 % par rapport \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode en 1996. OC Transpo a sensibilis\u00e9 les chauffeurs qui avaient eu des absences au cours des trois premiers mois de 1997 au fait que l\u2019absent\u00e9isme excessif compromettait sa capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des usagers, tout en leur rappelant la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail.\n[21] Le 29 septembre 1997, Mme Desormeaux et Mme Vye ont rencontr\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau M. Marcotte. Bien que M. Marcotte n\u2019ait pas mis en doute le caract\u00e8re l\u00e9gitime des absences de Mme Desormeaux, il s\u2019est inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 de sa capacit\u00e9, compte tenu de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, de faire preuve d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Desormeaux a dit avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Marcotte de lui dire exactement combien de jours par ann\u00e9e elle pourrait s\u2019absenter. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que M. Marcotte a refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question, se contentant de dire qu\u2019elle devait am\u00e9liorer son niveau d\u2019assiduit\u00e9.\n[22] Compte tenu de ses pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 l\u2019aptitude de Mme Desormeaux \u00e0 travailler, M. Marcotte a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019article 15.3 de la convention collective liant OC Transpo au Syndicat uni du transport, dont Mme Desormeaux faisait partie. Cet article permet \u00e0 OC Transpo de demander qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 produise un certificat sign\u00e9 par son m\u00e9decin attestant son aptitude \u00e0 travailler, dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019employeur a des motifs raisonnables de croire que l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 est peut-\u00eatre inapte du point de vue m\u00e9dical \u00e0 travailler de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. En outre, la convention collective pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur ne soit pas satisfait du certificat m\u00e9dical produit par l\u2019employ\u00e9, auquel cas il peut diriger ce dernier vers un m\u00e9decin choisi par OC Transpo en vue de l\u2019obtention d\u2019un nouveau certificat. M. Marcotte a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il se souciait d\u2019obtenir plus de renseignements non pas \u00e0 propos du diagnostic concernant Mme Desormeaux, mais plut\u00f4t au sujet du pronostic quant \u00e0 son aptitude \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 l\u2019avenir.\n[23] Afin de pr\u00e9server le caract\u00e8re confidentiel des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux de l\u2019employ\u00e9, les demandes de cette nature sont achemin\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne du travail d\u2019OC Transpo. Le 30 septembre 1997, Louise Culham, infirmi\u00e8re en hygi\u00e8ne du travail, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux pour lui demander de fournir un avis de son m\u00e9decin quant \u00e0 son aptitude \u00e0 travailler de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. En fait, Mme Culham a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux de poser \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin les questions suivantes :\n\u00cates-vous atteinte d\u2019une affection m\u00e9dicale qui pourrait entra\u00eener un niveau d\u2019absent\u00e9isme d\u00e9passant les limites du raisonnable? Votre probl\u00e8me est\u2011il de nature temporaire ou chronique? Quelles sont les chances que vous puissiez en venir \u00e0 exercer vos fonctions \u00e0 temps plein et de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re?\n[24] Le m\u00e9decin de famille de Mme Desormeaux, le Dr Anne Meehan, a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la demande d\u2019OC Transpo dans une lettre en date du 16 octobre 1997. Dans sa lettre, le Dr Meehan pr\u00e9cisait ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\n... au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e9coul\u00e9e [Mme Desormeaux] a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 quelques probl\u00e8mes qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 des absences au travail. Le premier probl\u00e8me concerne ses migraines. Nous avons finalement constat\u00e9 que ces migraines \u00e9taient caus\u00e9es par une dysfonction m\u00e9canique du cou. Elle a donc entrepris un programme d\u2019exercices r\u00e9guliers pour le cou tout en suivant des traitements de physioth\u00e9rapie, ce qui a consid\u00e9rablement r\u00e9duit l\u2019acuit\u00e9 et la fr\u00e9quence de ses maux de t\u00eate.\nUn autre probl\u00e8me qu\u2019elle a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e9coul\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 celui des calculs r\u00e9naux. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 et n\u2019est donc pas susceptible de constituer un malaise permanent. Enfin, Mme Desormeaux subit actuellement des examens pour v\u00e9rifier la pr\u00e9sence possible d\u2019une masse sur ses ovaires. C\u2019est le Dr Treehuba qui est charg\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier la chose et qui, au besoin, d\u00e9terminera le traitement qui pourrait \u00eatre administr\u00e9. Ce d\u00e9r\u00e8glement ovarien ne lui cause pas de probl\u00e8me pour l\u2019instant.\nEn r\u00e9ponse aux questions pr\u00e9cises que vous avez pos\u00e9es, sachez que le seul probl\u00e8me dans la liste de ceux que je viens d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer qui pourrait persister \u00e0 long terme est celui des migraines. Compte tenu de la nette am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de Mme Desormeaux, laquelle s\u2019explique par les efforts qu\u2019elle a elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s et les traitements de physioth\u00e9rapie, je ne pr\u00e9vois pas que les migraines puissent entraver sensiblement sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer ses fonctions de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et \u00e0 temps plein. Les calculs r\u00e9naux et le d\u00e9r\u00e8glement ovarien sont des malaises isol\u00e9s qui ne sont pas susceptibles de devenir chroniques ou de resurgir\u2026\nComme on ne lui avait pas express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 si Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, le Dr Meehan n\u2019a pas abord\u00e9 cet aspect dans sa lettre. Rien dans la lettre du Dr Meehan n\u2019indique que Mme Desormeaux devait faire l\u2019objet de quelconques mesures d\u2019adaptation.\n[25] Louise Culham a ensuite transmis \u00e0 M. Marcotte le message suivant :\n[TRADUCTION]\n[Mme Desormeaux] a peut-\u00eatre un probl\u00e8me qui pourrait persister \u00e0 long terme? . Toutefois, compte tenu de la nette am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de Mme Desormeaux, laquelle s\u2019explique par les efforts qu\u2019elle a elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s , son m\u00e9decin estime que ce probl\u00e8me ne devrait pas entraver sensiblement sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer ses fonctions de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et \u00e0 temps plein.\nBien que le Dr Meehan ait affirm\u00e9 que Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une affection susceptible de persister \u00e0 long terme, personne chez OC Transpo ne l\u2019a consult\u00e9 ni n\u2019a fait quelque tentative que ce soit pour obtenir une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante.\n[26] La preuve donne \u00e0 croire qu\u2019OC Transpo traiterait aujourd\u2019hui tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9remment un cas comme celui de Mme Desormeaux. Lois Emberg, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque la coordonnatrice, \u00c9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, chez OC Transpo et qui, \u00e0 ce titre, \u00e9tait responsable notamment des questions touchant les droits de la personne, a indiqu\u00e9 que si l\u2019organisation recevait maintenant une lettre comme celle que le Dr Meehan a \u00e9crite, son m\u00e9decin relancerait vraisemblablement l\u2019auteur pour tenter de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019employ\u00e9 est atteint d\u2019un d\u00e9ficience. On se demanderait \u00e9galement si des mesures d\u2019adaptation s\u2019imposent et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, ce qui pourrait \u00eatre fait \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[27] Mme Desormeaux, M. Vye et M. Marcotte se sont r\u00e9unis \u00e0 nouveau le 6 novembre 1997[2] afin d\u2019examiner les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019enqu\u00eate m\u00e9dicale et le pronostic quant \u00e0 l\u2019aptitude de Mme Desormeaux \u00e0 faire montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail. Mme Desormeaux a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle avait affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Marcotte qu\u2019elle faisait tout en son pouvoir pour se pr\u00e9senter au travail de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Elle a dit qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 M. Marcotte de pr\u00e9ciser combien de jours d\u2019absence on tol\u00e9rerait et qu\u2019il avait refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question, pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il voulait que son niveau d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 s\u2019am\u00e9liore sensiblement.\n[28] Mme Desormeaux a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que M. Vye avait dit \u00e0 M. Marcotte \u00e0 cette occasion que ses migraines pourraient constituer une d\u00e9ficience et qu\u2019il avait propos\u00e9 qu\u2019on examine des mesures d\u2019adaptation possibles. M. Marcotte a admis que M. Vye avait abord\u00e9 la question \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, bien qu\u2019il ne f\u00fbt pas certain qu\u2019il l\u2019ait fait \u00e0 cette occasion. M. Vye n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. La documentation \u00e9tablie par M. Marcotte ne fait aucunement mention d\u2019une telle discussion.\n[29] J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Desormeaux \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et je conclus que, le 6 novembre 1997, OC Transpo a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant du fait que Mme Desormeaux pouvait \u00eatre atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. M. Marcotte a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il avait sous sa surveillance en 1998 entre 300 et 350 employ\u00e9s et qu\u2019il avait, au cours de sa carri\u00e8re chez OC Transpo, effectu\u00e9 700 \u00e0 800 entrevues avec des employ\u00e9s au sujet de leur rendement. Il n\u2019y a donc rien d\u2019\u00e9tonnant \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ne puisse se souvenir du moment o\u00f9 la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e la premi\u00e8re fois. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que son emploi \u00e9tait en jeu, la rencontre rev\u00eatait de toute \u00e9vidence une plus grande importance pour Mme Desormeaux que pour M. Marcotte, de sorte qu\u2019elle est plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de se souvenir du moment o\u00f9 M. Vye a formul\u00e9 les observations en question. Mme Desormeaux a affirm\u00e9 que M. Marcotte [TRADUCTION] n\u2019entendait pas ce que M. Vye disait; par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas \u00e9tonnant que la documentation faisant \u00e9tat de cette rencontre n\u2019en fasse pas mention. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Desormeaux, il ne semble pas que la question de l\u2019accommodement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0.\n[30] Selon Mme Desormeaux, M. Marcotte a conclu la r\u00e9union en disant : [TRADUCTION] Je ne veux pas avoir \u00e0 vous convoquer \u00e0 une autre rencontre ici en septembre prochain. Elle a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 cette remarque comme signifiant qu\u2019elle avait une autre ann\u00e9e pour tenter d\u2019am\u00e9liorer son niveau d\u2019assiduit\u00e9.\n[31] La lettre r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Marcotte \u00e0 la suite de cette r\u00e9union fait allusion aux assurances donn\u00e9es par Mme Desormeaux quant aux mesures qu\u2019elle prenait pour enrayer ses migraines :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00abEn outre, je suis encourag\u00e9 d\u2019entendre que vous \u00eates consciente du fait que vous pouvez prendre vous-m\u00eame des mesures pour neutraliser les malaises dont vous souffrez et qu\u2019il n\u2019en tient qu\u2019\u00e0 vous de le faire.\u00bb\n[32] Bien que la question de la d\u00e9ficience ait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 6 novembre, M. Marcotte n\u2019a pas suivi la proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9crite dans le programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences. Il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux de se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante pour d\u00e9terminer si elle \u00e9tait vraiment atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il n\u2019a pas non plus demand\u00e9 qu\u2019on consulte le Dr Meehan \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[33] Entre le 6 novembre 1997 et la cessation de son emploi le 30 janvier 1998, Mme Desormeaux s\u2019est absent\u00e9e du travail \u00e0 quatre occasions, soit l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de sept jours complets. Mme Desormeaux a affirm\u00e9 que toutes ces absences \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 des migraines. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle prenait du Norgesic Forte, un m\u00e9dicament tr\u00e8s puissant contre les maux de t\u00eate, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pu conduire un autobus en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Chacune de ces absences a \u00e9t\u00e9 document\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un formulaire de demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019absence d\u2019OC Transpo sign\u00e9 par le Dr Meehan et pr\u00e9cisant le motif de l\u2019absence.\n[34] De surcro\u00eet, Mme Desormeaux est arriv\u00e9e en retard deux fois durant cette p\u00e9riode parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pu se lever \u00e0 temps.\nC. La cessation d\u2019emploi [35] Le 30 janvier 1998, Mme Desormeaux a rencontr\u00e9 MM. Marcotte et Walton en compagnie de M. Vye. On l\u2019a alors inform\u00e9e qu\u2019OC Transpo mettait fin \u00e0 son emploi. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que la nouvelle l\u2019avait abasourdie, car elle croyait avoir une autre ann\u00e9e pour am\u00e9liorer son rendement.\n[36] Les notes prises \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 par M. Walton confirment que Mme Desormeaux a dit \u00e0 MM. Marcotte et Walton \u00e0 cette occasion que toutes ses absences r\u00e9centes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par des migraines. Selon Mme Desormeaux, M. Vye a alors indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau que ses maux de t\u00eate constituaient une d\u00e9ficience et qu\u2019OC Transpo devrait songer \u00e0 des mesures d\u2019adaptation. Au dire de Mme Desormeaux, M. Marcotte a r\u00e9pondu que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019OC Transpo serait maintenue.\n[37] M. Marcotte reconna\u00eet que M. Vye a soulev\u00e9 lors de cette rencontre la question de la d\u00e9ficience et de l\u2019obligation de composer avec la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Desormeaux. Selon les notes de M. Walton, M. Marcotte aurait r\u00e9pondu que bien que les absences de Mme Desormeaux aient peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 attribuables \u00e0 ses migraines, elle s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9galement absent\u00e9e pendant des p\u00e9riodes relativement longues pour d\u2019autres motifs. M. Marcotte a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne du travail d\u2019OC Transpo ne lui avait pas fourni d\u2019information indiquant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner des mesures d\u2019adaptation possibles. De m\u00eame, M. Marcotte a dit n\u2019avoir re\u00e7u aucune information indiquant qu\u2019il fallait obtenir une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante.\n[38] S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019avis fourni par le Dr Meehan, M. Marcotte a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019en novembre 1997, OC Transpo s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que Mme Desormeaux puisse d\u00e9sormais faire preuve d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail. Selon M. Marcotte, l\u2019avis du Dr Meehan indiquait que rien n\u2019emp\u00eachait Mme Desormeaux de se pr\u00e9senter au travail de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Dans les semaines qui ont suivi la r\u00e9union du 6 novembre, Mme Desormeaux s\u2019est absent\u00e9e du travail \u00e0 plusieurs reprises (sept journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes et deux parties de journ\u00e9e). Ces absences ont amen\u00e9 l\u2019employeur \u00e0 conclure que les chances qu\u2019elle puisse venir travailler de fa\u00e7on assidue \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s minimes. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 qu\u2019on a pris la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi pour absent\u00e9isme involontaire chronique.\nII. LE CADRE JURIDIQUE [39] La plainte de Mme Desormeaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cet article pr\u00e9cise que le fait de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Or, selon l\u2019article 3 de la Loi, la d\u00e9ficience est un motif de discrimination illicite.\n[40] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi, un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel fond\u00e9 sur des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ne constitue pas un acte discriminatoire.\n[41] L\u2019avocate d\u2019OC Transpo a soutenu que la norme de preuve dans le cas d\u2019une plainte relative aux droits de la personne est plus exigeante que celle qui s\u2019applique dans les affaires civiles ordinaires, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cette assertion, elle a invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour du Banc de la Reine de l\u2019Alberta dans l\u2019affaire Berry c. Farm Meats Canada Ltd[3]. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, la norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination est celle qui s\u2019applique dans les causes civiles ordinaires, soit la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s [4].\n[42] En outre, OC Transpo a pr\u00e9tendu que la jurisprudence arbitrale confirme le droit d\u2019un employeur \u00e0 la part qui leur revient aux termes du contrat d\u2019emploi, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire \u00e0 la prestation de services pour laquelle l\u2019employ\u00e9 est r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9. Bien que les arbitres tiennent compte des principes des droits de la personne, l\u2019avocate soutient qu\u2019il est possible qu\u2019un contrat d\u2019emploi soit inex\u00e9cutable sans que ce ne soit de la faute de l\u2019employ\u00e9.\n[43] Ce Tribunal a trait\u00e9 du lien entre les droits de la personne et la jurisprudence arbitrale dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il a r\u00e9cemment rendue dans l\u2019affaire Eyerley c. Seaspan International Ltd [5]. Je souscris au raisonnement expos\u00e9 dans cette d\u00e9cision. Les concepts propres aux relations de travail ne s\u2019appliquent pas dans l\u2019absolu; ils sont assujettis aux param\u00e8tres fix\u00e9s par la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne.\n[44] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a r\u00e9examin\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode \u00e0 adopter relativement aux affaires touchant les droits de la personne dans deux arr\u00eats : Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU[6] (l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin) et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights)[7] (l\u2019arr\u00eat Grismer). La distinction historique entre la discrimination directe et la discrimination indirecte fait place d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode unifi\u00e9e de traitement des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. Selon cette m\u00e9thode, il incombe d\u2019abord \u00e0 la partie plaignante d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e[8].\n[45] Une fois qu\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il revient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la politique ou norme discriminatoire constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Dans cette optique, la partie intim\u00e9e doit d\u00e9sormais prouver :\nqu\u2019elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e; qu\u2019elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme en question en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, l\u2019employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il ne pouvait composer avec les employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9sentant les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans subir une contrainte excessive[9].\n[46] L\u2019expression contrainte excessive n\u2019est pas d\u00e9finie dans la Loi. Toutefois, la Cour supr\u00eame a fourni beaucoup de param\u00e8tres permettant de d\u00e9terminer si une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur la contrainte excessive a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a fait observer que l\u2019adjectif excessive laisse supposer qu\u2019une certaine contrainte est acceptable; toutefois, il faut absolument, pour satisfaire \u00e0 la norme, que la contrainte impos\u00e9e soit excessive [10]. La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement fait observer que le d\u00e9fendeur, afin de prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, a toujours la charge de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle inclut toute possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement sans qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive[11]. Il incombe au d\u00e9fendeur d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il a examin\u00e9 et raisonnablement rejet\u00e9 toutes les formes d\u2019accommodement possibles. Le d\u00e9fendeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019incorporer dans la norme des mesures visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins individuels sans qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive[12]. Afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat des efforts du d\u00e9fendeur en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement, il faut tenir compte de la perspective d\u2019atteinte r\u00e9elle aux droits d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s[13]. L\u2019adoption de la norme du d\u00e9fendeur doit \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve convaincants. La preuve, constitu\u00e9e d\u2019impressions, ne suffit pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement[14]. Enfin, les facteurs tels que le co\u00fbt des mesures d\u2019adaptation possibles devraient \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s d\u2019une mani\u00e8re souple et conforme au bon sens, en fonction des faits de chaque cas[15].\n[47] Pour faire droit \u00e0 une plainte de discrimination, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient le seul motif des actes reproch\u00e9s. Il suffit que la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant soit un des facteurs ayant influenc\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi[16].\nIII. L\u2019ANALYSE A. Cons\u00e9quences de la d\u00e9cision Adams [48] Le Syndicat uni du transport a contest\u00e9 la cessation d\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux. Le grief, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e, a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruit par l\u2019honorable George Adams, c.r., le 27 juillet 1998. Le 5 ao\u00fbt 1998, Me Adams a rendu une d\u00e9cision dans laquelle il a conclu qu\u2019OC Transpo avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 Mme Desormeaux pour un motif valable. Par cons\u00e9quent, le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9.\n[49] Avant le d\u00e9but de la pr\u00e9sente audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate contestant la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour plusieurs motifs. L\u2019un des arguments invoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e voulait que, du fait du principe de la chose jug\u00e9e, le Tribunal n\u2019ait pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la plainte de Mme Desormeaux, car l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la question \u00e9tait en cause.\n[50] J\u2019ai tranch\u00e9 cette requ\u00eate \u00e0 la faveur d\u2019une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire, dans laquelle j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la cause d\u2019action ne s\u2019appliquait pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la question que devait trancher Me Adams n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la m\u00eame que celle soumise \u00e0 ce Tribunal et que les parties aux deux instances n\u2019\u00e9taient pas les m\u00eames.\n[51] Dans le cas de la plainte instruite par Me Adams, on s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soutenu dans le cours de l\u2019audience du Tribunal que s\u2019il y avait litige relativement \u00e0 un de ces faits, je devrais appliquer le principe de l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la cause d\u2019action et consid\u00e9rer que ces faits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9s dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage.\n[52] L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut remettre en litige une chose que j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e dans ma d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas li\u00e9 par les conclusions de l\u2019arbitre Adams. Cependant, ayant soigneusement examin\u00e9 les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019avocate au nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il me semble que ce que cette derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9tend, en fait, c\u2019est que Mme Desormeaux ne devrait pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 modifier des aveux faits en son nom lors de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage.\n[53] \u00c0 mon avis, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 me pencher sur cet argument, \u00e0 la lueur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie \u00e0 l\u2019audience, car il ne semble pas que ni la Commission ni Mme Desormeaux ne conteste s\u00e9rieusement les faits reconnus devant Me Adams.\nB. Quelle est la norme? [54] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la norme d\u2019emploi est l\u2019exigence d\u2019OC Transpo voulant que ses employ\u00e9s fassent montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail.\nC. Existe\u2011t\u2011il une preuve prima facie de discrimination? [55] Dans le cas qui nous occupe, je dois d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer si Mme Desormeaux et la Commission ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de preuve prima facie, car on n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. OC Transpo pr\u00e9tend que la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que Mme Desormeaux est en proie \u00e0 des migraines et que toutes les autres maladies et blessures dont elle a souffert au fil des ann\u00e9es \u00e9taient des maux passagers qu\u2019on ne saurait qualifier de d\u00e9ficiences.\ni) Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait-elle atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience? [56] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Desormeaux a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souffrait de maux de t\u00eate chroniques bien des ann\u00e9es avant d\u2019\u00eatre embauch\u00e9e par OC Transpo. D\u2019apr\u00e8s ses dires, ses maux de t\u00eate commencent habituellement durant la nuit par une douleur dans le cou. La douleur envahit graduellement l\u2019un des c\u00f4t\u00e9s de sa t\u00eate. Si elle se l\u00e8ve alors qu\u2019elle est en proie \u00e0 un tel mal de t\u00eate, elle est prise de naus\u00e9e et se met \u00e0 vomir. Elle devient aussi tr\u00e8s sensible \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re. Elle a historiquement \u00e9t\u00e9 afflig\u00e9e de ce genre de mal de t\u00eate une ou deux fois par mois; de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le malaise dure d\u2019un \u00e0 trois jours. Durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 chez OC Transpo, elle a continu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre en proie \u00e0 des maux de t\u00eate.\n[57] Mme Desormeaux a souvent consult\u00e9 des m\u00e9decins au sujet de ses maux de t\u00eate. Au moment o\u00f9 elle est entr\u00e9e au service d\u2019OC Transpo, elle se faisait traiter par son m\u00e9decin de famille, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque le Dr Lyla Graham. En 1990, le Dr Graham a dirig\u00e9 Mme Desormeaux vers le Dr H. Rabinovitch, un neurologue, en vue d\u2019un examen plus approfondi. Le Dr Rabinovitch a examin\u00e9 Mme Desormeaux le 11 janvier 1990, puis a fait rapport de ses conclusions au Dr Graham. Voici un extrait du rapport du Dr Rabinovitch : [TRADUCTION] \u00c0 mon avis, elle souffre probablement \u00e0 la fois de migraines et de la c\u00e9phal\u00e9e de tension \u2026 Je vais prendre des dispositions en vue d\u2019un \u00e9lectroenc\u00e9phalogramme et d\u2019un tomodensitogramme, mais il est douteux selon moi que nous d\u00e9couvrions beaucoup d\u2019autres choses\u2026 Mme Desormeaux a dit qu\u2019elle avait subi les deux examens, mais qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e des r\u00e9sultats. Elle a dit avoir compris qu\u2019on communiquerait avec elle uniquement si les examens r\u00e9v\u00e9laient quelque chose digne de mention. Il n\u2019y a aucune trace des conclusions de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre examen.\n[58] En juillet 1996, Mme Desormeaux a chang\u00e9 de m\u00e9decin de famille et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 consulter le Dr Meehan de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Le Dr Meehan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elle a d\u00e9crit ses observations au sujet des maux de t\u00eate de Mme Desormeaux, ainsi que les diverses formes de traitement et les diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9dicaments qu\u2019elle lui a prescrits au fil des ann\u00e9es.\n[59] Selon le Dr Meehan, les sympt\u00f4mes d\u00e9crits par Mme Desormeaux correspondaient \u00e0 ceux dont elle avait fait part au Dr Rabinovitch en 1990. Ce sont les sympt\u00f4mes classiques de migraines aigu\u00ebs. Le Dr Meehan a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne conna\u00eet pas la cause des migraines, mais qu\u2019il existe certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u00e9clencheurs. Le traitement des migraines consiste \u00e0 tenter de d\u00e9terminer quels sont ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u00e9clencheurs en vue de les \u00e9viter et \u00e0 administrer dans certains cas des prophylactiques afin de pr\u00e9venir leur r\u00e9surgence. En outre, divers genres d\u2019analg\u00e9siques sont \u00e9galement prescrits pour r\u00e9duire la douleur rapidement et efficacement avec le moins d\u2019effets secondaires possible.\n[60] On fait souvent appel \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode d\u2019essais et d\u2019erreurs pour le traitement des migraines, selon le Dr Meehan. Dans le cas de Mme Desormeaux, le Dr Meehan a recommand\u00e9 de faire l\u2019essai de traitements de physioth\u00e9rapie afin de r\u00e9duire la tension musculaire dans la r\u00e9gion cervicale. En r\u00e9duisant la tension au niveau du cou, on peut att\u00e9nuer l\u2019acuit\u00e9 des migraines. Le Dr Meehan a aussi fait prendre \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux divers m\u00e9dicaments en vue de d\u00e9terminer celui qui serait le plus efficace. Comme les fluctuations du niveau hormonal peuvent souvent d\u00e9clencher des migraines chez la femme, le Dr Meehan a \u00e9ventuellement prescrit \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux du Depo-Provera, un m\u00e9dicament qui supprime l\u2019ovulation et \u00e9limine les cycles menstruels qui, souvent, d\u00e9clenchent des migraines[17].\n[61] Le Dr Meehan a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas senti le besoin de diriger Mme Desormeaux vers un neurologue en vue d\u2019une autre \u00e9valuation. Selon le Dr Meehan, Mme Desormeaux avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 consult\u00e9 un neurologue et ne manifestait aucun des sympt\u00f4mes qui auraient pu l\u2019amener \u00e0 mettre en doute le bien-fond\u00e9 du diagnostic du Dr Rabinovitch.\n[62] Depuis qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait devenue le m\u00e9decin de famille de Mme Desormeaux en 1996, le Dr Meehan avait \u00e9galement trait\u00e9 celle\u2011ci pour diverses autres affections : calculs r\u00e9naux, kystes ovariens, infection respiratoire, gastro-ent\u00e9rite virale.\n[63] \u00c0 l\u2019automne 1997, lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 son avis au sujet de l\u2019aptitude de Mme Desormeaux \u00e0 travailler, le Dr Meehan a dit que tous les ennuis de sant\u00e9 de sa patiente, hormis ses migraines, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solus, de sorte qu\u2019elle ne serait pas en proie \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes permanents. En ce qui concerne les migraines de Mme Desormeaux, le Dr Meehan a dit qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient davantage ma\u00eetris\u00e9s mais que, vu la nature de l\u2019affection dont souffrait sa patiente, elle ne pouvait pr\u00e9dire quand le malaise r\u00e9appara\u00eetrait. Ces maux de t\u00eate entravaient la capacit\u00e9 de Mme Desormeaux d\u2019exercer ses fonctions. De plus, un grand nombre de m\u00e9dicaments auxquels on a recours pour traiter des migraines ont des effets secondaires qui rendraient dangereuse la conduite d\u2019un autobus.\n[64] Le point de d\u00e9part de mon analyse de la question \u00e0 savoir si Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait atteinte ou non d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience r\u00e9side forc\u00e9ment dans la d\u00e9finition de ce mot, telle qu\u2019elle figure \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Malheureusement, cet article n\u2019est gu\u00e8re utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9finition qu\u2019on y trouve est quelque peu tautologique. En effet, le mot d\u00e9ficience est d\u00e9fini comme suit : D\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu\u2019elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e\u2026 .\n[65] L\u2019arr\u00eat le plus r\u00e9cent rendu par un tribunal judiciaire au sujet de ce qui constitue une d\u00e9ficience est celui prononc\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville); Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Boisbriand (Ville)[18]. La Cour supr\u00eame a jug\u00e9 que le terme handicap (qui est utilis\u00e9 comme synonyme du terme d\u00e9ficience qu\u2019on emploie dans le contexte des droits de la personne)[19], \u2026 ne doit pas \u00eatre enferm\u00e9 dans une d\u00e9finition \u00e9tanche et d\u00e9pourvue de souplesse [20].\n[66] L\u2019avocate d\u2019OC Transpo pr\u00e9tend que Mme Desormeaux n\u2019\u00e9tait pas atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, soutenant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souffre effectivement de migraines. Elle est d\u2019avis que le Dr Meehan, \u00e0 titre de m\u00e9decin de famille, n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour diagnostiquer des migraines. \u00c0 son avis, je ne puis, en l\u2019absence d\u2019un diagnostic \u00e9tabli par un neurologue, conclure que Mme Desormeaux souffre de migraines.\n[67] Plusieurs raisons militent en faveur du rejet de l\u2019argument de l\u2019avocate. Je suis persuad\u00e9e qu\u2019un m\u00e9decin de famille raisonnablement comp\u00e9tent est en mesure de diagnostiquer et de traiter des migraines. De plus, le cas de Mme Desormeaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 par un neurologue en 1990. Le Dr Rabinovitch a conclu que Mme Desormeaux souffrait probablement \u00e0 la fois de migraines et de la c\u00e9phal\u00e9e de tension . Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Meehan a affirm\u00e9 que les sympt\u00f4mes de Mme Desormeaux \u00e9taient les sympt\u00f4mes classiques de migraines aigu\u00ebs. On ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve m\u00e9dicale qui pourrait m\u2019amener \u00e0 mettre en doute l\u2019avis du Dr Meehan ou la conclusion du Dr Rabinovitch.\n[68] En outre, m\u00eame si j\u2019acceptais la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019avocate \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, je n\u2019en conclurais pas moins que les maux de t\u00eate de Mme Desormeaux constituent une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que Mme Desormeaux souffre depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es de maux de t\u00eate d\u00e9bilitants chroniques. Il m\u2019importe peu que ces maux de t\u00eate soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s formellement comme des migraines ou d\u2019autres genres de maux de t\u00eate. On n\u2019a contest\u00e9 ni la description faite par Mme Desormeaux de ses sympt\u00f4mes ni celle de leurs incidences, ainsi que des effets des m\u00e9dicaments n\u00e9cessaires sur sa capacit\u00e9 de fonctionner. Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle souffre depuis longtemps de maux de t\u00eate qui la plongent p\u00e9riodiquement dans un \u00e9tat d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 grave au point d\u2019entraver sa capacit\u00e9 de faire son travail. \u00c0 mon avis, cela constitue une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[69] Pour les motifs que j\u2019\u00e9noncerai plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si les autres maladies et blessures dont a souffert Mme Desormeaux au fil des ann\u00e9es \u00e9taient des maux passagers ou des d\u00e9ficiences.\nii) La d\u00e9ficience de Mme Desormeaux a\u2011t\u2011elle influ\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi? [70] Ayant conclu que Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, il me reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si celle\u2011ci a influ\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9cision d\u2019OC Transpo de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n[71] OC Transpo soutient que Mme Desormeaux n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 cause d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Compte tenu des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de Mme Desormeaux et des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux dont elle disposait, OC Transpo en serait venue \u00e0 la conclusion que Mme Desormeaux ne serait pas en mesure de faire montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. En outre, OC Transpo, eu \u00e9gard au rapport du Dr Meehan, \u00e9tait persuad\u00e9e que les absences r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es de Mme Desormeaux n\u2019\u00e9taient pas attribuables \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience.\n[72] Je n\u2019accepte pas les arguments d\u2019OC Transpo \u00e0 ce propos. Il est \u00e9vident que la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation par l\u2019employeur des chances qu\u2019elle puisse se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 son travail de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, compte tenu notamment de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019assiduit\u00e9. Que l\u2019on consid\u00e8re ou non que les absences caus\u00e9es par ses autres maux \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience, il reste qu\u2019un pourcentage important de ses absences \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 ses maux de t\u00eate. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, pour faire droit \u00e0 une plainte de discrimination, que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient le seul motif des actes reproch\u00e9s. Il est \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue discriminatoire de tenir compte d\u2019absences li\u00e9es \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience pour d\u00e9cider de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi d\u2019une personne pour absent\u00e9isme excessif[21].\n[73] Il faut \u00e9galement se rappeler que les incidents d\u00e9terminants qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 le cong\u00e9diement de Mme Desormeaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les absences survenues entre novembre 1997 et le 30 janvier 1998. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que toutes ces absences (\u00e0 l\u2019exception de celles survenues les deux matins o\u00f9 elle est arriv\u00e9e en retard au travail parce qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9veill\u00e9e \u00e0 temps) r\u00e9sultaient des maux de t\u00eate de Mme Desormeaux.\n[74] Dans ces circonstances, je suis persuad\u00e9e que la Commission et Mme Desormeaux ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\nD. OC Transpo s\u2019est\u2011elle acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau? [75] Comme nous avons conclu qu\u2019il existe une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, il incombe \u00e0 OC Transpo de d\u00e9montrer que la norme de l\u2019assiduit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e aux chauffeurs d\u2019autobus constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Afin de d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, il faut \u00e9tablir trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Nous examinerons chacun de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\ni) Lien rationnel [76] OC Transpo doit d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle a adopt\u00e9 sa norme consistant \u00e0 faire montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail \u00e0 une fin ou dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exercice des fonctions. L\u2019analyse \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape ne porte pas sur la validit\u00e9 de la norme en cause, mais plut\u00f4t sur la validit\u00e9 de son objet plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral[22].\n[77] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce que l\u2019exigence voulant que les chauffeurs d\u2019autobus fassent montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail est rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la prestation de services de transport en commun en temps opportun.\nii) Bonne foi [78] Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment que doit \u00e9tablir OC Transpo est qu\u2019elle a adopt\u00e9 sa norme de l\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail en toute bonne foi, estimant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la prestation de services de transport en commun en temps opportun.\n[79] Dans sa plaidoirie, l\u2019avocat de la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette derni\u00e8re ne voulait pas insinuer qu\u2019OC Transpo n\u2019avait pas agi de bonne foi. N\u00e9anmoins, la Commission, au cours de l\u2019audience, a contest\u00e9 les faits et gestes d\u2019OC Transpo, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire le recours \u00e0 la norme de l\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail et la r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux le nombre tol\u00e9rable de journ\u00e9es d\u2019absence. Elle l\u2019a fait une seule fois, en 1990, lorsqu\u2019elle a dit \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux qu\u2019elle ne pourrait s\u2019absenter du travail plus de cinq fois ou pendant plus de 12 jours sur une p\u00e9riode de 12 mois. Selon la Commission, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exigeait qu\u2019on fixe aux employ\u00e9s un objectif num\u00e9rique de pr\u00e9sence. \u00c0 son avis, on aurait pu d\u00e9cider, par exemple, que la norme \u00e9tait le taux moyen d\u2019absent\u00e9isme de l\u2019organisation.\n[80] Ron Marcotte a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de nombre maximum de jours o\u00f9 les employ\u00e9s d\u2019OC Transpo peuvent s\u2019absenter du travail. OC Transpo estime qu\u2019il est du devoir des employ\u00e9s de se pr\u00e9senter au travail, bien qu\u2019elle reconnaisse qu\u2019il puisse arriver de temps \u00e0 autre qu\u2019ils ne soient pas en mesure de le faire pour des raisons de sant\u00e9. Elle craint qu\u2019en indiquant aux employ\u00e9s un nombre pr\u00e9cis de jours o\u00f9 ils peuvent s\u2019absenter, l\u2019on donne l\u2019impression que chacun d\u2019eux peut s\u2019absenter un certain nombre de jours sans cons\u00e9quence. La norme de l\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail offre la souplesse voulue, car elle permet \u00e0 l\u2019employeur d\u2019adapter \u00e0 chaque situation particuli\u00e8re sa fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9agir. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Marcotte a indiqu\u00e9, par exemple, que certains employ\u00e9s avaient en 1997\u20111998 un dossier d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 pire que celui de Mme Desormeaux, mais qu\u2019ils en \u00e9taient \u00e0 une \u00e9tape moins avanc\u00e9e dans le programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences. On ne mettrait pas fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de ces personnes, car on voulait leur donner d\u2019autres chances de parvenir \u00e0 faire montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9.\n[81] Lors de sa plaidoirie, l\u2019avocate d\u2019OC Transpo a soutenu que les faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce illustrent parfaitement les probl\u00e8mes qui peuvent se poser lorsqu\u2019on pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 le nombre maximum de jours o\u00f9 ils peuvent s\u2019absenter du travail. Mme Desormeaux a avou\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que la fois o\u00f9 on lui a fix\u00e9 un objectif num\u00e9rique, elle avait conduit un autobus avec dans son syst\u00e8me du Tylenol 3 afin de respecter l\u2019objectif qu\u2019on lui avait fix\u00e9.\n[82] Je n\u2019accepte pas les arguments de la Commission quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9ciser le nombre de jours o\u00f9 l\u2019on peut s\u2019absenter. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a indiqu\u00e9 que les normes d\u2019emploi ne doivent pas \u00eatre arbitraires et doivent permettre de tenir compte de la situation de chacun[23]. Il serait de toute \u00e9vidence discriminatoire d\u2019imposer une exigence arbitraire voulant que l\u2019absent\u00e9isme d\u2019un employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9 ne puisse d\u00e9passer le taux moyen de l\u2019organisation, conditions auxquelles ne sont pas soumis les autres employ\u00e9s[24]. Par cons\u00e9quent, OC Transpo a satisfait \u00e0 mon avis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment bonne foi du crit\u00e8re Meiorin.\niii) OC Transpo a\u2011t\u2011elle compos\u00e9 avec Mme Desormeaux sans qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive? [83] La derni\u00e8re question \u00e0 trancher est la suivante : OC Transpo a\u2011t\u2011elle d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que sa norme de l\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la prestation de services de transport en commun en temps opportun. Afin de d\u00e9montrer que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de composer avec Mme Desormeaux sans qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte pour l\u2019employeur une contrainte excessive.\n[84] Le point de d\u00e9part de mon analyse consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de Mme Desormeaux au moment o\u00f9 OC Transpo a pris la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Mme Desormeaux a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 au fil des ann\u00e9es toute une panoplie de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, sans parler des nombreuses blessures qu\u2019elle a subies. Cependant, rien dans la preuve n\u2019indique qu\u2019il existe un lien entre les divers malaises qui expliquent son taux \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019absent\u00e9isme ou que son incapacit\u00e9 de faire montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail est attribuable \u00e0 une seule et m\u00eame cause. Il semble plut\u00f4t que Mme Desormeaux ait simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s malchanceuse au fil des ann\u00e9es, \u00e9tant en proie \u00e0 une multitude de maux et de blessures non apparent\u00e9s. La plupart de ces malaises semblent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e, et la preuve indique qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019automne de 1997, seules ses migraines \u00e9taient susceptibles de persister \u00e0 long terme. Autrement dit, rien dans la preuve m\u00e9dicale qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e n\u2019indique que Mme Desormeaux risquait plus que tout autre employ\u00e9 d\u2019OC Transpo d\u2019\u00e9prouver des ennuis de sant\u00e9 (mis \u00e0 part ses maux de t\u00eate).\n[85] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Lois Emberg a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019observation du Dr Meehan voulant que les migraines de Mme Desormeaux risquent de persister \u00e0 long terme aurait d\u00fb susciter la crainte qu\u2019elle soit atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Dans les circonstances, on n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb, selon Mme Emberg, d\u00e9cider de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi avant d\u2019avoir examin\u00e9 comme il se doit la th\u00e8se de la d\u00e9ficience. OC Transpo a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de donner \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux trois mois de plus pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle pouvait se pr\u00e9senter au travail de mani\u00e8re assidue. Elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 le faire en raison de ses maux de t\u00eate et on a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n[86] Afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de composer avec Mme Desormeaux, je dois examiner dans quelle mesure ses migraines auraient vraisemblablement entrav\u00e9 sa capacit\u00e9 de faire montre d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail apr\u00e8s janvier 1998. Une fa\u00e7on d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019absent\u00e9isme futur consiste \u00e0 examiner les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de Mme Desormeaux. En janvier 1998, Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait au service d\u2019OC Transpo depuis environ 8,75 ann\u00e9es. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, elle s\u2019\u00e9tait absent\u00e9e 57 journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes et 11 parties de journ\u00e9e en raison de maux de t\u00eate. Cela signifie qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 absente en moyenne 6,5 journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes et 1,25 partie de journ\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de ses migraines. Ces chiffres doivent peut-\u00eatre \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9s l\u00e9g\u00e8rement \u00e0 la hausse afin de tenir compte du fait que Mme Desormeaux s\u2019est aussi absent\u00e9e pour d\u2019autres motifs, notamment par suite d\u2019une blessure au dos qui l\u2019a tenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du travail durant 79 jours. Durant ces absences, Mme Desormeaux a peut-\u00eatre souffert de migraines qui ne lui auraient pas permis de se pr\u00e9senter au travail. De m\u00eame, il se peut qu\u2019il faille r\u00e9viser les chiffres \u00e0 la hausse afin de tenir compte des effets que les absences non consign\u00e9es de Mme Desormeaux auraient eues sur son taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme. Cependant, la preuve ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir clairement si ces absences non consign\u00e9es \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 des migraines.\n[87] D\u2019autre part, il semblerait qu\u2019en ce qui concerne les absences attribuables \u00e0 des migraines, les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 de Mme Desormeaux ne soient peut-\u00eatre pas un indicateur pr\u00e9cis de son assiduit\u00e9 future et qu\u2019on pourrait raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 une am\u00e9lioration \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La preuve m\u00e9dicale non contredite dont disposait OC Transpo \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait qu\u2019on avait fait des progr\u00e8s en ce qui touche l\u2019isolement d\u2019une des causes de ses maux de t\u00eate. Dans son rapport d\u2019octobre 1997, le Dr Meehan a inform\u00e9 OC Transpo que des correctifs \u00e9taient en voie d\u2019\u00eatre apport\u00e9s pour pallier la dysfonction m\u00e9canique du cou et qu\u2019on avait not\u00e9 une nette am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019\u00e9tat de Mme Desormeaux. Bien que Mme Desormeaux n\u2019ait cess\u00e9 de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter \u00e0 M. Marcotte que ses migraines \u00e9taient en voie d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9prim\u00e9es, OC Transpo avait pour la premi\u00e8re fois une preuve m\u00e9dicale permettant de croire qu\u2019on pouvait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les perspectives d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 de Mme Desormeaux s\u2019am\u00e9liorent.\n[88] Cependant, entre la rencontre du 6 novembre 1997 et la cessation de son emploi le 30 janvier 1998, Mme Desormeaux s\u2019est absent\u00e9e du travail \u00e0 quatre occasions, soit sept jours au total, en raison de migraines. En outre, elle s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au travail en retard \u00e0 deux reprises parce qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9veill\u00e9e \u00e0 temps. En ce qui concerne ses deux derni\u00e8res absences, qu\u2019il suffise de dire que le fait qu\u2019elle ne se soit pas r\u00e9veill\u00e9e \u00e0 temps et se soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en retard deux fois au travail durant une p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 son emploi \u00e9tait nettement en p\u00e9ril ne contribue certes pas \u00e0 rehausser l\u2019image que projette Mme Desormeaux du point de vue de l\u2019\u00e9thique professionnelle.\n[89] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme li\u00e9 aux migraines, la fr\u00e9quence des absences de Mme Desormeaux au cours de la p\u00e9riode de trois mois qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la cessation de son emploi aurait raisonnablement pu amener OC Transpo \u00e0 s\u2019interroger sur l\u2019exactitude du pronostic du Dr Meehan. Bien que M. Marcotte ait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant du motif des absences de Mme Desormeaux durant cette p\u00e9riode, rien n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour tirer au clair les conclusions du Dr Meehan. On n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 de demander au Dr Meehan pour quelle raison Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait aussi souvent en proie \u00e0 des migraines au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, et si les absences caus\u00e9es par ce probl\u00e8me modifiaient son opinion quant au pronostic d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 concernant sa patiente. De m\u00eame, rien n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en vue d\u2019obtenir une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante de l\u2019\u00e9tat de Mme Desormeaux, malgr\u00e9 le fait que le programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences d\u2019OC Transpo pr\u00e9voyait express\u00e9ment une telle \u00e9valuation.\n[90] Par cons\u00e9quent, en janvier 1998, une certaine incertitude planait au sujet du pronostic concernant Mme Desormeaux. Au regard de toutes les circonstances, je suis persuad\u00e9e que les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 de longue date de Mme Desormeaux chez OC Transpo \u00e9taient l\u2019indicateur le plus fiable de son assiduit\u00e9 future.\n[91] La question suivante \u00e0 examiner est celle \u00e0 savoir si OC Transpo aurait pu composer avec un employ\u00e9 affichant un taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme attribuable \u00e0 des migraines aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui de Mme Desormeaux. La pr\u00e9tention d\u2019OC Transpo selon laquelle elle ne pouvait composer avec les absences sporadiques et constantes de Mme Desormeaux est fond\u00e9e principalement sur des consid\u00e9rations op\u00e9rationnelles. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je note que la cessation d\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux est survenue avant les modifications apport\u00e9es par le projet de loi S\u20115 \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le paragraphe 15 (2) de la Loi modifi\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise que les facteurs \u00e0 examiner du point de vue de l\u2019accommodement sont la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le co\u00fbt[25]. Par cons\u00e9quent, mon examen de la question de l\u2019accommodement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est soumis aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (commission des droits de la personne)[26] et les arr\u00eats ult\u00e9rieurs.\n[92] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Dairy Pool, la Cour supr\u00eame donne une liste non exhaustive des genres de facteurs qui peuvent constituer une contrainte excessive et fait \u00e9tat notamment des consid\u00e9rations op\u00e9rationnelles telles que l\u2019importance de l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019employeur et l\u2019interchangeabilit\u00e9 des effectifs. La Cour divisionnaire de l\u2019Ontario a r\u00e9cemment statu\u00e9 que les difficult\u00e9s logistiques que pose le remplacement de travailleurs absents constitue une contrainte excessive[27].\n[93] M. Marcotte a expliqu\u00e9 que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s qui exploitent des autobus suivent des horaires pr\u00e9\u00e9tablis. Les usagers s\u2019attendent \u00e0 ce que leur autobus arrive et parte \u00e0 temps afin de leur permettre de prendre leur correspondance et de vaquer \u00e0 leurs affaires. Si un trop grand nombre de chauffeurs ne se pr\u00e9sentent pas au travail un jour donn\u00e9, il se peut qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas suffisamment de personnel pour que tous les autobus puissent prendre la route. Une telle situation cause des interruptions de service et occasionne des probl\u00e8mes aux citoyens de la r\u00e9gion de la capitale nationale, qui comptent sur OC Transpo pour leur transport. Contrairement aux absences \u00e0 long terme, auxquelles OC Transpo peut suppl\u00e9er, les absences intermittentes de derni\u00e8re minute posent des d\u00e9fis particuliers.\n[94] Les chauffeurs d\u2019autobus d\u2019OC Transpo peuvent choisir leurs itin\u00e9raires et leurs horaires de travail en fonction de leur anciennet\u00e9. Ces choix sont valables pour une dur\u00e9e de 17 semaines. Pour chaque bloc de 17 semaines, on dresse une liste des suppl\u00e9ants . Les 75 \u00e0 100 chauffeurs dont les noms figurent sur cette liste n\u2019ont pas de trajet attitr\u00e9. C\u2019est \u00e0 eux qu\u2019il incombe de remplacer les chauffeurs absents, au besoin.\n[95] De temps \u00e0 autre, il n\u2019y a pas suffisamment de noms sur la liste pour suppl\u00e9er \u00e0 toutes les absences. Dans ces cas\u2011l\u00e0, on offre aux chauffeurs qui ont des trajets attitr\u00e9s la possibilit\u00e9 de faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. S\u2019il n\u2019y a pas suffisamment de chauffeurs pr\u00eats \u00e0 faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, les autobus ne sortent tout simplement pas du d\u00e9p\u00f4t, ce qui occasionne des interruptions de service.\n[96] OC Transpo a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, par l\u2019entremise de M. Marcotte, un relev\u00e9 indiquant le niveau de prestation de service pour la semaine du 21 au 27 janvier 2001. Selon ce relev\u00e9, on a annul\u00e9 cette semaine-l\u00e0 626 trajets sur un total de 37 445. Ces trajets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9s pour diverses raisons : autobus pr\u00e9sentant des probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9caniques, retards au d\u00e9p\u00f4t, accidents. Dans 106 cas, les autobus n\u2019ont pas quitt\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t pour diverses raisons, notamment le manque de chauffeurs.\n[97] Parmi les 626 trajets annul\u00e9s, il semble que l\u2019autobus ait finalement quitt\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t dans 395 cas. M. Marcotte a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019on a alors fait appel \u00e0 des extras . On ne sait pas exactement s\u2019il entendait par l\u00e0 des employ\u00e9s dont le nom figurait sur la liste des suppl\u00e9ants ou d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, 231 trajets sur les 37 445 pr\u00e9vus n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s. Cependant, ces statistiques doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es avec prudence, car on ne sait pas exactement combien de ces 231 trajets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9s en raison du manque de personnel plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9caniques ou d\u2019autres facteurs.\n[98] Selon Paul MacDonnell, l\u2019ex\u2011pr\u00e9sident de la section locale 279 du Syndicat uni du transport, l\u2019\u00e9chantillon de janvier 2001 n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas indicatif des taux d\u2019annulation typiques. \u00c0 son avis, le mois de janvier, du fait qu\u2019il se situe au milieu de l\u2019hiver, est le pire mois de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pour ce qui est des annulations de trajets, vu le taux d\u2019incidence \u00e9lev\u00e9 de d\u00e9faillances m\u00e9caniques. M. Marcotte n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu aux commentaires de M. MacDonnell \u00e0 propos du pourcentage accru d\u2019ennuis m\u00e9caniques durant les mois d\u2019hiver, mais il a indiqu\u00e9 que les temp\u00e9ratures incl\u00e9mentes de l\u2019hiver n\u2019\u00e9taient pas une grande entrave \u00e0 la prestation de service, car Ottawa [TRADUCTION] a d\u2019excellents nettoyeurs de rues . M. Marcotte a admis qu\u2019il peut y avoir des probl\u00e8mes dans le cas d\u2019une grosse temp\u00eate de neige. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de pr\u00e9ciser s\u2019il y avait eu une temp\u00eate dans la semaine du 21 au 27 janvier 2001.\n[99] M. Marcotte n\u2019a pu fournir de donn\u00e9es comparables au sujet du niveau de prestation de service au cours de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 on a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux, mais il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rare que la liste des suppl\u00e9ants soit \u00e9puis\u00e9e \u00e0 cause des absences des employ\u00e9s. Dans un tel cas, on avait recours au surtemps afin que les autobus puissent partir \u00e0 temps. Selon M. Marcotte, il y a [TRADUCTION] m\u00eame eu des jours o\u00f9 nous n\u2019avons pas pu travailler en surtemps , ce qui signifie sans doute que des trajets ont d\u00fb \u00eatre annul\u00e9s certains jours. Toutefois, il n\u2019a pas fourni d\u2019indications quant \u00e0 la fr\u00e9quence de ces annulations.\n[100] OC Transpo est un important employeur. M. MacDonnell a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019OC Transpo compte toujours entre 1 200 et 1 500 chauffeurs d\u2019autobus. Le budget annuel de l\u2019organisation s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 150 millions de dollars. Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi OC Transpo n\u2019embauchait tout simplement pas plus de chauffeurs afin d\u2019\u00eatre absolument s\u00fbre de pouvoir offrir le service, M. MacDonnell a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il y avait eu des gels de recrutement et des compressions de personnel. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il co\u00fbtait moins cher \u00e0 OC Transpo de faire faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires que d\u2019embaucher plus de chauffeurs.\n[101] C\u2019est dans ce contexte que je dois maintenant d\u00e9terminer si le maintien en poste de Mme Desormeaux cr\u00e9erait une contrainte excessive pour OC Transpo, en raison de ses absences intermittentes. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il convient de se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au t\u00e9moignage de Ron Marcotte \u00e0 propos du programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences d\u2019OC Transpo. Selon M. Marcotte, les employ\u00e9s soumis au programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences en 1995\u20111996 \u00e9taient ceux qui s\u2019absentaient au moins 18 jours par ann\u00e9e. En 1997\u20111998, le taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme avait l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diminu\u00e9. M. Marcotte a indiqu\u00e9 que le seuil d\u2019inclusion dans le programme \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre de 13 jours par ann\u00e9e, m\u00eame s\u2019il ne semblait pas en \u00eatre absolument s\u00fbr. J\u2019ai conclu qu\u2019un pronostic r\u00e9aliste quant aux absences futures de Mme Desormeaux en raison de ses migraines serait de l\u2019ordre de 6,5 journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes et de 1,25 partie de journ\u00e9e par ann\u00e9e, ce qui est bien en de\u00e7\u00e0 du taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme qui caract\u00e9rise 25 % des chauffeurs d\u2019autobus d\u2019OC Transpo. M\u00eame si l\u2019on alloue quelques jours de plus chaque ann\u00e9e pour les maux passagers tels que les rhumes et les grippes, je ne puis conclure qu\u2019en janvier 1998, le taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme futur de Mme Desormeaux aurait vraisemblablement d\u00e9pass\u00e9 celui d\u2019une proportion importante de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre d\u2019OC Transpo[28].\n[102] J\u2019admets que des absences intermittentes sont susceptibles de constituer une contrainte excessive dans le cas, par exemple, d\u2019un petit \u00e9tablissement o\u00f9 l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 fournit des services uniques \u00e0 son employeur. Toutefois, dans le cas qui nous occupe, OC Transpo poss\u00e8de un vaste effectif et les fonctions de ses chauffeurs sont dans une large mesure interchangeables. OC Transpo reconna\u00eet que, chaque jour, un certain nombre de ses chauffeurs ne seront pas en mesure de se pr\u00e9senter au travail. Vu la nature du service qu\u2019elle offre, OC Transpo pallie ces absences gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de suppl\u00e9ance, lequel semble g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement fonctionner tr\u00e8s bien. Au regard de la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9e que Mme Desormeaux imposerait un fardeau excessif au syst\u00e8me de suppl\u00e9ance \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas convaincue qu\u2019OC Transpo a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle aurait subi une contrainte excessive en gardant Mme Desormeaux \u00e0 son service.\n[103] En outre, la preuve indique qu\u2019il aurait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de r\u00e9duire quelque peu le niveau d\u2019absent\u00e9isme de Mme Desormeaux en modifiant ses fonctions. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Desormeaux, il semble qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait totalement inapte \u00e0 travailler aux premiers stades d\u2019une migraine, mais qu\u2019elle pouvait fonctionner dans une certaine mesure lorsque le mal \u00e9tait en voie de se dissiper. Bien qu\u2019elle soit incapable de conduire un autobus en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019elle est sous l\u2019effet de m\u00e9dicaments, elle est en mesure d\u2019exercer d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches utiles pour le compte d\u2019OC Transpo. Selon M. MacDonnell, les chauffeurs d\u2019autobus qui doivent faire l\u2019objet de mesures d\u2019adaptation peuvent remplir d\u2019autres fonctions que celles qui consistent \u00e0 conduire un autobus.\n[104] De m\u00eame, M. MacDonnell a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il existe des fa\u00e7ons pour OC Transpo d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les effets des absences intermittentes de Mme Desormeaux sur la prestation de service. Par exemple, le nom de Mme Desormeaux pourrait \u00eatre inscrit sur la liste des suppl\u00e9ants. Les chauffeurs dont le nom se trouve sur cette liste n\u2019ont pas toujours \u00e0 prendre la route; par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019absence d\u2019un chauffeur dont le nom figure sur la liste des suppl\u00e9ants est moins susceptible de perturber l\u2019exploitation.\n[105] Aucune de ces solutions de rechange n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e avant la cessation d\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Marcotte estimait de toute \u00e9vidence que la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la situation reposait uniquement sur les \u00e9paules de Mme Desormeaux.\n[106] Avant de d\u00e9laisser la question de l\u2019accommodement, il convient de commenter plusieurs autres aspects. Bien qu\u2019il y ait eu des t\u00e9moignages au sujet du co\u00fbt des cong\u00e9s de maladie, la preuve dont j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie en ce qui concerne la situation financi\u00e8re d\u2019OC Transpo est insuffisante pour que je puisse conclure qu\u2019exiger qu\u2019OC Transpo continue d\u2019offrir de tels avantages \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux constituerait une contrainte excessive[29].\n[107] OC Transpo a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la preuve par l\u2019entremise de Lois Emberg, et du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ses rapports annuels sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, au sujet du nombre important de personnes handicap\u00e9es qui sont \u00e0 son service. J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 cette preuve qui, toutefois, ne m\u2019a gu\u00e8re \u00e9t\u00e9 utile pour d\u00e9terminer ce qui s\u2019est produit dans le cas de Francine Desormeaux. De m\u00eame, il y a eu des t\u00e9moignages au sujet du comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen de la situation des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s, un comit\u00e9 mixte syndical-patronal mis sur pied pour examiner les mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 prendre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s d\u2019OC Transpo. Cette preuve doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Emberg selon lequel le comit\u00e9 n\u2019entrait en sc\u00e8ne que lorsqu\u2019un employ\u00e9 devait faire l\u2019objet de mesures d\u2019adaptation durant une p\u00e9riode de plus de quatre semaines cons\u00e9cutives. Par cons\u00e9quent, le comit\u00e9, au dire de Mme Emberg, ne serait pas intervenu dans un cas comme celui de Mme Desormeaux o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019absences intermittentes de courte dur\u00e9e.\n[108] OC Transpo soutient que Mme Desormeaux n\u2019a jamais dit ce dont elle avait besoin en termes d\u2019accommodement et n\u2019a, de surcro\u00eet, fourni aucune documentation m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une telle requ\u00eate. Mme Desormeaux s\u2019est plut\u00f4t content\u00e9e de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter sans cesse \u00e0 M. Marcotte qu\u2019elle respecterait la norme de l\u2019assiduit\u00e9 au travail. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Desormeaux, selon OC Transpo, n\u2019a pas satisfait \u00e0 son obligation de faciliter la recherche d\u2019un accommodement.\n[109] Il est reconnu que Mme Desormeaux a toujours fait preuve d\u2019une tr\u00e8s grande candeur envers son employeur quant \u00e0 ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Il est vrai \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle a tent\u00e9 au fil des ann\u00e9es de fournir \u00e0 son employeur l\u2019assurance que la situation s\u2019am\u00e9liorerait \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. Cependant, alors que la cessation de son emploi \u00e9tait imminente, la question de l\u2019accommodement a fait surface. J\u2019ai conclu que M. Vye avait, lors de la rencontre du 6 novembre 1997, demand\u00e9 si les migraines de Mme Desormeaux constituaient une d\u00e9ficience et donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre qu\u2019on devrait examiner des moyens de composer avec Mme Desormeaux. J\u2019ai accept\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Desormeaux selon lequel M. Marcotte [TRADUCTION] n\u2019entendait pas ce que M. Vye lui disait et selon lequel la question de l\u2019accommodement n\u2019avait pas vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e. Il est \u00e9vident que malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il avait en sa possession un rapport m\u00e9dical indiquant que Mme Desormeaux avait d\u2019un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 susceptible d\u2019avoir des cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 long terme, probl\u00e8me qui continuait de causer des absences, M. Marcotte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner ce qui pourrait \u00eatre fait pour tenir compte des besoins de Mme Desormeaux.\n[110] Le droit est clair au sujet des obligations de l\u2019employeur et de l\u2019employ\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement : il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9 de porter \u00e0 la connaissance de son employeur les faits li\u00e9s \u00e0 la discrimination. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019a fait Mme Desormeaux par l\u2019entremise de M. Vye. Il n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 de trouver une solution; cette responsabilit\u00e9 incombe \u00e0 son employeur[30]. Dans les circonstances, je suis persuad\u00e9e que Mme Desormeaux s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation de faciliter la recherche d\u2019un accommodement.\n[111] La derni\u00e8re question qu\u2019il me reste \u00e0 examiner est celle de la responsabilit\u00e9 du Syndicat uni du transport. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019avocat d\u2019OC Transpo pr\u00e9tend que si l\u2019on conclut qu\u2019elle a exerc\u00e9 une discrimination envers Mme Desormeaux, le syndicat [TRADUCTION] n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 son obligation de composer avec la d\u00e9ficience de celle-ci en omettant d\u2019informer l\u2019employeur, d\u00e8s l\u2019instauration du programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences, que Mme Desormeaux devait prendre un nombre excessif de cong\u00e9s \u00e0 cause de ses migraines .\n[112] Il convient de noter que le syndicat n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Desormeaux. Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, OC Transpo a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter le nom du syndicat \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9. Pour les motifs invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. L\u2019examen des arguments de l\u2019avocate ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir clairement si elle tente d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance contre le syndicat. Comme j\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter le nom du syndicat \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9, je ne vois pas comment je pourrais rendre une ordonnance contre le syndicat, qui n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 la plainte, m\u00eame si j\u2019\u00e9tais dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire.\n[113] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je ne vois pas, compte tenu de la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, de fondement qui permettrait d\u2019\u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 du syndicat en appliquant l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des th\u00e9ories \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud relativement \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 syndicale. Le fait que le syndicat ait pris part aux consultations au sujet de la politique de gestion des pr\u00e9sences d\u2019OC Transpo ne fait pas de celle\u2011ci une politique patronale-syndicale. De plus, le probl\u00e8me que j\u2019ai d\u00e9crit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9coule non pas de la politique d\u2019OC Transpo, mais plut\u00f4t de la fa\u00e7on dont le cas de Mme Desormeaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 par son employeur. De m\u00eame, rien dans la preuve dont j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie ne me donne \u00e0 croire qu\u2019\u00e0 aucun moment avant le 30 janvier 1998, le syndicat ait fait quoi que ce soit pour nuire \u00e0 des efforts visant \u00e0 composer avec Mme Desormeaux.\n[114] Pour les motifs invoqu\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus, je fais droit \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Desormeaux.\nIV. LES MESURES DE REDRESSEMENT A. R\u00e9int\u00e9gration [115] Dans les cas o\u00f9 il juge qu\u2019une plainte de discrimination est fond\u00e9e, un tribunal des droits de la personne a le devoir de tenter de remettre la partie plaignante dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019acte discriminatoire. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la meilleure fa\u00e7on d\u2019exercer ce devoir est de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Desormeaux dans son poste de chauffeur d\u2019autobus chez OC Transpo. Mme Desormeaux doit recevoir les cr\u00e9dits d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et les avantages, y compris les cr\u00e9dits de pension, dont elle aurait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e sans interruption par OC Transpo. En outre, elle doit recevoir toute formation n\u00e9cessaire pour parfaire ses comp\u00e9tences et se familiariser \u00e0 nouveau avec les politiques et proc\u00e9dures de l\u2019organisation.\n[116] En ordonnant la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de Mme Desormeaux dans son poste de chauffeur d\u2019autobus, je laisse \u00e0 OC Transpo, en consultation avec Mme Desormeaux et son syndicat, le soin de trouver un poste pour lequel ses absences intermittentes perturberont le moins possible le service. J\u2019ordonne \u00e9galement \u00e0 OC Transpo de consulter Mme Desormeaux et son syndicat, ainsi que le Dr Meehan, si n\u00e9cessaire, afin de d\u00e9terminer quelles mesures peuvent \u00eatre prises en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 afin de r\u00e9duire au minimum les absences de Mme Desormeaux tout en \u00e9vitant qu\u2019elle doive conduire un autobus sous l\u2019influence de m\u00e9dicaments. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je note que le Syndicat uni du transport s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 collaborer pleinement \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de toute ordonnance que le Tribunal prononcerait contre OC Transpo en ce qui touche la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de Mme Desormeaux dans ses fonctions.\n[117] Enfin, Mme Desormeaux a demand\u00e9 de ne pas avoir \u00e0 expliquer ou justifier chacune de ses absences. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je ne crois pas que Mme Desormeaux puisse s\u2019attendre \u00e0 pouvoir s\u2019absenter impun\u00e9ment du travail. Son employeur a le droit de recevoir une explication l\u00e9gitime de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00eatre convaincu que ses absences sont justifi\u00e9es. Mme Desormeaux doit, tout comme les autres chauffeurs d\u2019autobus d\u2019OC Transpo, \u00eatre tenue de produire des certificats m\u00e9dicaux et d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019information au sujet de ses absences.\nB. Pertes salariales [118] Conform\u00e9ment au principe selon lequel les tribunaux des droits de la personne doivent tenter, dans la mesure du possible, d\u2019indemniser compl\u00e8tement la victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, Mme Desormeaux doit recevoir la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qu\u2019elle a perdue par suite de la cessation de son emploi chez OC Transpo. Selon OC Transpo, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce titre devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duite puisque Mme Desormeaux n\u2019a pas pris les mesures voulues pour att\u00e9nuer ses pertes.\n[119] D\u00e8s qu\u2019OC Transpo a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi, Mme Desormeaux a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher du travail et a vite trouv\u00e9 des emplois \u00e0 temps partiel de travailleuse des services de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et de chauffeur d\u2019autobus scolaire. Elle a conduit une voiture taxi servant au transport scolaire. Mme Desormeaux s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 une entrevue pour un poste dans une compagnie offrant des randonn\u00e9es en autocar, mais l\u2019emploi ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 offert apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut expliqu\u00e9 les circonstances de son d\u00e9part de chez OC Transpo. Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sans succ\u00e8s de nombreuses demandes d\u2019emploi, le bureau d\u2019assurance-emploi l\u2019a dirig\u00e9e vers un expert-conseil en vue de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un curriculum vitae selon les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019art. Mme Desormeaux a \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de fonder sa propre entreprise de taxi pour conduire des enfants \u00e0 des rendez-vous. Cependant, elle n\u2019a pas poursuivi dans cette veine lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est rendu compte que le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019OC Transpo participait au processus d\u2019octroi de permis.\n[120] En f\u00e9vrier 1999, Mme Desormeaux a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019inscrire au Mican Business College. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, son grief avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 et il lui fallait se recycler en vue de pouvoir gagner un salaire comparable \u00e0 celui qu\u2019elle touchait chez OC Transpo. Elle a suivi des cours d\u2019informatique chez Mican en vue d\u2019obtenir un poste d\u2019adjointe administrative, tout en continuant de travailler \u00e0 temps partiel comme chauffeur de voitures taxi servant de transport scolaire.\n[121] Apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s son programme d\u2019\u00e9tudes chez Mican en juillet 1999, Mme Desormeaux s\u2019est inscrite aupr\u00e8s d\u2019une agence de placement temporaire avant d\u2019obtenir un poste \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 la biblioth\u00e8que publique de Gloucester, o\u00f9 elle est demeur\u00e9e jusqu\u2019en janvier 2000, date o\u00f9 elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme examinatrice au minist\u00e8re des Transports de l\u2019Ontario. Au moment de l\u2019audience, Mme Desormeaux \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de ce minist\u00e8re.\n[122] OC Transpo a fait remarquer que de nombreux postes de chauffeur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9s au cours de la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi la cessation d\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux, faisant valoir que la d\u00e9cision de cette derni\u00e8re de retourner \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole plut\u00f4t que de postuler un emploi constituait un choix personnel. Par cons\u00e9quent, OC Transpo ne devrait pas \u00e0 son avis avoir \u00e0 payer le salaire que Mme Desormeaux a perdu entre janvier et juillet 1999. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord.\n[123] Au moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e par OC Transpo, Mme Desormeaux justifiait de pr\u00e8s de neuf ann\u00e9es de service. Elle avait travaill\u00e9 chez OC Transpo pendant toute sa carri\u00e8re de chauffeur et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de fournir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences susceptibles de l\u2019aider \u00e0 trouver un nouvel emploi. Mme Desormeaux s\u2019est vite mise \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un emploi. Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut cherch\u00e9 en vain un emploi \u00e0 temps plein pendant un an \u00e0 la suite de sa cessation d\u2019emploi, sa d\u00e9cision de se recycler m\u2019appara\u00eet tout \u00e0 fait raisonnable. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis persuad\u00e9e que Mme Desormeaux a pris des mesures raisonnables pour att\u00e9nuer ses pertes et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de rajuster son indemnit\u00e9 pour tenir compte du salaire qu\u2019elle a perdu pendant sa p\u00e9riode de recyclage.\n[124] Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Desormeaux doit \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9dommag\u00e9e des pertes salariales qu\u2019elle a subies entre le 30 janvier 1998 et la date de sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. Les parties s\u2019entendent sur la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qu\u2019elle aurait touch\u00e9e si elle \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9e au service d\u2019OC Transpo. Il convient de d\u00e9falquer de cette r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ses revenus d\u2019autres sources. Il incombe \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux de veiller \u00e0 rembourser \u00e0 l\u2019Assurance-emploi les prestations qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ues au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[125] Si les parties ne peuvent s\u2019entendre sur les sommes dues \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, elles peuvent communiquer avec moi.\nC. Majoration [126] Mme Desormeaux a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire au titre de ses pertes salariales. Il se peut que le versement d\u2019une telle indemnit\u00e9 ait des cons\u00e9quences fiscales n\u00e9gatives pour elle. \u00c0 mon avis, il serait injuste de p\u00e9naliser Mme Desormeaux en lui imposant, par suite du versement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire, un fardeau fiscal plus lourd que celui qu\u2019elle aurait assum\u00e9 si elle avait re\u00e7u un salaire de fa\u00e7on ininterrompue entre janvier 1998 et la date du paiement. Cela va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objectif, qui est d\u2019indemniser compl\u00e8tement Mme Desormeaux. Par cons\u00e9quent, OC Transpo doit verser \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux un montant suppl\u00e9mentaire suffisant pour couvrir l\u2019imp\u00f4t exc\u00e9dentaire qu\u2019elle devra payer en touchant l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire.\n[127] En outre, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant OC Transpo de payer les frais actuariels associ\u00e9s au calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats et de la majoration. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9e que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces calculs soit complexe au point d\u2019exiger de faire appel \u00e0 un actuaire. Si les parties ne peuvent s\u2019entendre sur les montants dus \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, elles peuvent pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres observations au Tribunal.\nD. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [128] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, tel qu\u2019il existait en janvier 1998, pr\u00e9voyait le versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 5 000 $ dans le cas d\u2019un acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 ou lorsque la victime a subi un pr\u00e9judice moral. Il existe une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de cas qui justifient l\u2019octroi d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 5 000 $ doit \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux pires cas[31].\n[129] OC Transpo soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas commis un acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 en mettant fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux, et que son personnel \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] en voie de se familiariser avec ses obligations envers les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, il est \u00e9vident que Mme Desormeaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 fortement \u00e9branl\u00e9e par la perte de son emploi. Le stress dont elle a souffert par suite de son cong\u00e9diement a \u00e9t\u00e9 aggrav\u00e9 par les pressions financi\u00e8res auxquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en proie. \u00c0 titre de c\u00e9libataire, Mme Desormeaux s\u2019inqui\u00e9tait beaucoup de ne pouvoir faire face \u00e0 ses obligations en \u00e9tant priv\u00e9e de tout revenu et contrainte d\u2019\u00e9puiser ses \u00e9conomies pour assurer sa subsistance. Elle est encore tr\u00e8s \u00e9mue lorsqu\u2019elle d\u00e9crit les effets que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant la cessation de son emploi ont eus sur elle.\n[130] Au regard de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, j\u2019accorde \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux un montant de 4 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale.\nE. Int\u00e9r\u00eats [131] L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale et l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au titre des pertes salariales donnent droit au paiement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats[32]. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, j\u2019ordonne que soient vers\u00e9s des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les indemnit\u00e9s vers\u00e9es en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au titre des pertes salariales commenceront \u00e0 courir le 30 janvier 1998 et seront calcul\u00e9es en se fondant sur les sommes que Mme Desormeaux aurait re\u00e7ues en guise de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale commenceront \u00e0 courir le 30 janvier 1998. Cependant, le montant total qui sera pay\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, int\u00e9r\u00eats compris, ne doit pas d\u00e9passer 5 000 $[33].\nF. Excuses [132] Mme Desormeaux demande des excuses pour la fa\u00e7on dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e dans le cours de son emploi. Elle avait d\u2019abord exig\u00e9 des excuses de la part de M. Marcotte, mais elle s\u2019est ravis\u00e9e par la suite. Elle pr\u00e9f\u00e8re maintenant que les excuses lui soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par OC Transpo.\n[133] OC Transpo soutient que je dois refuser de rendre l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9avis prescrit en vertu des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal. Ayant examin\u00e9 les documents divulgu\u00e9s par la Commission, il est clair qu\u2019OC Transpo a \u00e9t\u00e9 sensibilis\u00e9e au fait que des excuses seraient exig\u00e9es, bien que la Commission n\u2019ait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qui serait pri\u00e9 de les faire. Rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019OC Transpo aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa d\u00e9fense diff\u00e9remment si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment inform\u00e9e que l\u2019organisation serait pri\u00e9e d\u2019offrir des excuses, ou qu\u2019elle a subi un pr\u00e9judice. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis persuad\u00e9e qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de refuser des excuses pour le motif qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 un pr\u00e9avis suffisant de la requ\u00eate en ce sens.\n[134] Fait plus important, OC Transpo soutient \u00e9galement que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour prononcer une telle ordonnance, car le fait de la contraindre \u00e0 exprimer des opinions qu\u2019elle ne partage pas porterait atteinte \u00e0 sa libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et irait ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[135] Depuis que j\u2019ai re\u00e7u les observations \u00e9crites des parties \u00e0 ce sujet, on m\u2019a signal\u00e9 que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de la question constitutionnelle soulev\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Stevenson c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9[34]. Toute d\u00e9cision que je pourrais rendre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tant susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre remplac\u00e9e par celle de la Cour, j\u2019entends diff\u00e9rer ma d\u00e9cision sur la question des excuses jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties aient pu prendre connaissance de la d\u00e9cision qui sera rendue dans l\u2019affaire Stevenson et aient eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des observations au sujet de ses effets.\n[136] Si une des parties exige une d\u00e9cision imm\u00e9diate de la part du Tribunal, il faudra l\u2019en aviser; le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, je trancherai la question.\nG. Salaire perdu au cours de l\u2019audience [137] La Commission et Mme Desormeaux ont demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal ordonne que la plaignante soit indemnis\u00e9e des pertes salariales qu\u2019elle a subies en participant \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Comme j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 octroy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux une indemnit\u00e9 pour ses pertes salariales jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 rendre l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e, qui aurait pour r\u00e9sultat d\u2019accorder \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux une double r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour la p\u00e9riode en question.\nH. Consultation aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne [138] La Commission a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019OC Transpo soit enjointe de la consulter au sujet de sa politique en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019une telle mesure de redressement soit opportune en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et ce pour plusieurs raisons.\n[139] D\u2019abord, le probl\u00e8me dont j\u2019ai fait \u00e9tat en ce qui touche le traitement de la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Desormeaux d\u00e9coule non pas tant du libell\u00e9 de la politique d\u2019OC Transpo que du fait que cette politique n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre la cessation de l\u2019emploi de Mme Desormeaux et l\u2019audience a fait en sorte que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont dans une large mesure pris le pas sur la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des choses \u2013 non seulement la politique en mati\u00e8re de gestion des pr\u00e9sences qui \u00e9tait en vigueur en janvier 1998 n\u2019existe\u2011t\u2011elle plus \u00e0 OC Transpo, mais OC Transpo elle-m\u00eame n\u2019existe plus, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9e \u00e0 la Ville d\u2019Ottawa \u00e0 la faveur de la fusion municipale[35]. Par cons\u00e9quent, je refuse d\u2019ordonner une consultation.\nI.Maintien de la comp\u00e9tence [140] Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence pour le cas o\u00f9 les parties seraient incapables de s\u2019entendre sur les calculs \u00e0 faire ou sur l\u2019application des mesures de redressement d\u00e9crites dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nV. L\u2019ORDONNANCE [141] Pour les motifs mentionn\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus, je d\u00e9clare qu\u2019OC Transpo a port\u00e9 atteinte aux droits de Mme Desormeaux aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et j\u2019ordonne :\nque Mme Desormeaux soit r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans son poste de chauffeur d\u2019autobus \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion raisonnable, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision; que Mme Desormeaux soit indemnis\u00e9e de ses pertes salariales, dont le total sera calcul\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision; qu\u2019OC Transpo verse \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux une somme suffisante pour couvrir l\u2019imp\u00f4t suppl\u00e9mentaire qu\u2019elle aura \u00e0 payer en raison de la fa\u00e7on dont lui seront vers\u00e9es les indemnit\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus; qu\u2019OC Transpo verse \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux une somme de 4 000 $ en guise d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale; que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, des int\u00e9r\u00eats soit pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au titre des pertes salariales et de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale vers\u00e9es en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au titre des pertes salariales commenceront \u00e0 courir le 30 janvier 1998 et seront calcul\u00e9s en fonction des dates o\u00f9 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 payable \u00e0 Mme Desormeaux. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale commenceront \u00e0 courir le 30 janvier 1998; qu\u2019\u00e0 moins que l\u2019une d\u2019elles ne demande au Tribunal de prendre une d\u00e9cision imm\u00e9diate \u00e0 ce sujet, les parties puissent pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres observations sur la question des excuses, une fois que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aura rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Stevenson c.

La plaignante all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e sexuellement pendant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient tous deux membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de leur section locale du syndicat, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire de f\u00e9vrier \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 1998.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule partie repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par avocat \u00e0 l\u2019audience du Tribunal. La preuve de la plaignante a essentiellement \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le cadre de la preuve produite par la Commission. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame sa preuve.\nI. Les faits A. Le point de vue de la plaignante (i) Emploi et appartenance syndicale [3] La plaignante travaille \u00e0 Postes Canada depuis 1982. En 1998, elle occupait le poste d\u2019agent (conception et essais) au sein de la section de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la qualit\u00e9 du service. Cette section mesure le rendement en mati\u00e8re de livraison des produits de Postes Canada. La plaignante travaillait dans l\u2019un des grands immeubles qu\u2019occupe Postes Canada, pr\u00e8s de l\u2019intersection de la promenade Riverside et du chemin Heron \u00e0 Ottawa. Son bureau \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage d\u2019un immeuble de dix \u00e9tages d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la tour Est.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 recrut\u00e9 par Postes Canada en 1991. En 1998, le poste r\u00e9gulier qu\u2019il occupait \u00e9tait celui de superviseur \u2013 comptabilit\u00e9 du contr\u00f4le des op\u00e9rations, au sein de ce qui constitue, somme toute, le service de facturation et de comptabilit\u00e9 de Postes Canada. En avril et mai 1998, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 un poste sup\u00e9rieur, soit celui d\u2019agent. Son bureau \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 deux \u00e9tages au\u2011dessus de celui de la plaignante, au cinqui\u00e8me \u00e9tage de la tour Est.\n[5] Les deux parties \u00e9taient membres du Syndicat des employ\u00e9s des postes et communications (le SEPC), l\u2019agent de n\u00e9gociation d\u2019environ 3 000 employ\u00e9s de Postes Canada. Le SEPC est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (l\u2019AFPC). La plaignante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019int\u00e9resser \u00e0 certaines activit\u00e9s du SEPC en 1994; en 1996, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lue vice-pr\u00e9sidente de sa section locale \u2013 no 70180 du SEPC (la section locale). Il s\u2019agissait de la plus grande section locale du SEPC au pays. Elle comptait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque environ 1 000 membres.\n[6] M\u00eame si la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 travaillaient dans le m\u00eame immeuble, leurs fonctions \u00e9taient tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rentes. Ils se sont rencontr\u00e9s pour la premi\u00e8re fois en septembre 1997 au cours d\u2019une r\u00e9union des membres du syndicat. Plusieurs jours apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est rendu au bureau de la plaignante pour lui demander comment il pourrait s\u2019impliquer davantage dans les affaires syndicales. Elle lui a conseill\u00e9 de parler au pr\u00e9sident de la section locale de l\u2019\u00e9poque, M. Jim Fraser, ou au chef d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical, M. Ken Zarichansky. Elle a \u00e9galement sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de songer \u00e0 suivre plusieurs cours offerts par l\u2019AFPC.\n[7] La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019entre octobre 1997 et f\u00e9vrier 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est all\u00e9 la voir \u00e0 son bureau de Postes Canada environ une fois par mois. Elle \u00e9tait m\u00e9fiante, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y avait rien de particuli\u00e8rement inqui\u00e9tant dans la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Elle trouvait bizarre qu\u2019il continue de venir la voir alors qu\u2019elle lui avait conseill\u00e9 de parler aux autres membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale pour d\u00e9terminer comment il pourrait jouer un r\u00f4le accru au sein du syndicat.\n[8] Le 19 f\u00e9vrier 1998, il y a eu une r\u00e9union g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des membres afin d\u2019\u00e9lire l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale. M. Fraser ne voulait pas briguer \u00e0 nouveau la pr\u00e9sidence, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant se consacrer enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 ses autres fonctions de dirigeant \u00e0 temps plein de la section locale (poste \u00e0 temps plein r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9). Les membres ont alors \u00e9lu la plaignante pour le remplacer au poste de pr\u00e9sident. Le poste de tr\u00e9sorier \u00e9tait lui aussi vacant. \u00c0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, M. Fraser et d\u2019autres membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 rencontr\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ils le consid\u00e9raient comme un bon candidat au poste de tr\u00e9sorier, car il poss\u00e9dait des comp\u00e9tences en comptabilit\u00e9, exer\u00e7ait des fonctions comptables \u00e0 Postes Canada et avait suivi au niveau coll\u00e9gial des cours faisant partie du programme de comptabilit\u00e9 des comptables g\u00e9n\u00e9raux licenci\u00e9s (CGA).\n[9] Ces membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif ont recommand\u00e9 la candidature de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de nouvelle pr\u00e9sidente \u00e9lue, elle propose elle-m\u00eame sa candidature afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer ses chances d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9lu. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u2019abord oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e, en raison de l\u2019inqui\u00e9tude g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que suscitaient ses visites \u00e0 son bureau. Elle a finalement accept\u00e9 la suggestion de ses coll\u00e8gues et propos\u00e9 la candidature de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au poste de tr\u00e9sorier. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu.\n[10] Essentiellement, les fonctions du tr\u00e9sorier consistaient \u00e0 recevoir et d\u00e9poser l\u2019argent de la section locale et \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les ch\u00e8ques pour payer les factures, notamment les ch\u00e8ques de paye du dirigeant \u00e0 temps plein. En outre, le tr\u00e9sorier s\u2019occupait de pr\u00e9parer les \u00e9tats financiers annuels et le budget. En ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9mission des ch\u00e8ques, il fallait obtenir la signature de deux des dirigeants suivants : le tr\u00e9sorier, le pr\u00e9sident, le vice-pr\u00e9sident ou le dirigeant \u00e0 temps plein. Ce dernier n\u2019\u00e9tait toutefois pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 signer son propre ch\u00e8que de paye. Dix \u00e0 vingt ch\u00e8ques tout au plus \u00e9taient \u00e9mis chaque mois. La majeure partie des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif avaient trait aux griefs des membres de la section locale et aux mesures disciplinaires. C\u2019\u00e9tait surtout le dirigeant \u00e0 temps plein qui s\u2019occupait de ces questions en consultation avec le pr\u00e9sident et le chef d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical. Ces t\u00e2ches ne faisaient pas partie des fonctions du tr\u00e9sorier. On s\u2019attendait toutefois \u00e0 ce que le tr\u00e9sorier participe aux r\u00e9unions de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif, qui se r\u00e9unissait environ une fois par mois en soir\u00e9e.\n[11] La section locale avait lou\u00e9 de l\u2019espace \u00e0 bureau dans un immeuble situ\u00e9 \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 appartenant au Congr\u00e8s du travail du Canada (le CTC). L\u2019\u00e9difice du CTC \u00e9tait \u00e0 distance de marche du complexe de Postes Canada o\u00f9 travaillaient la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9. Tous les documents, y compris les documents financiers, \u00e9taient conserv\u00e9s au bureau de la section locale. L\u2019acc\u00e8s au bureau \u00e9tait restreint, mais tous les membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif, y compris l\u2019intim\u00e9, avaient re\u00e7u des cl\u00e9s et des cartes d\u2019acc\u00e8s leur permettant d\u2019y aller en tout temps, quel que soit le jour de la semaine. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne conservait aucun dossier financier ni m\u00eame aucun dossier syndical \u00e0 son bureau de Postes Canada. Elle ne s\u2019occupait pas directement des paiements effectu\u00e9s par la section locale, si ce n\u2019est qu\u2019elle devait approuver les indemnit\u00e9s de kilom\u00e9trage et d\u2019autres frais extraordinaires. La plaignante all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9, au moment de son entr\u00e9e en fonctions, avait re\u00e7u instruction de laisser les documents financiers et les ch\u00e8ques qu\u2019elle devait signer dans le pigeonnier au bureau de la section locale. Une fois sign\u00e9s, les ch\u00e8ques \u00e9taient post\u00e9s par le dirigeant \u00e0 temps plein qui travaillait l\u00e0\u2011bas tous les jours. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elle se rendait elle-m\u00eame chaque jour au bureau de la section locale, principalement pour v\u00e9rifier si l\u2019employeur avait envoy\u00e9 des pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures concernant la tenue de r\u00e9unions, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective.\n(ii) Visites et appels de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au bureau de la plaignante [12] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que tr\u00e8s peu de temps apr\u00e8s son \u00e9lection au poste de tr\u00e9sorier, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner ou \u00e0 venir la voir au travail de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9titive. Elle se souvient qu\u2019il t\u00e9l\u00e9phonait quatre ou cinq fois par jour et qu\u2019il descendait la voir \u00e0 son bureau tout aussi souvent. Compte tenu de l\u2019\u00e9tendue limit\u00e9e des fonctions du tr\u00e9sorier et du degr\u00e9 minime d\u2019interaction n\u00e9cessaire avec d\u2019autres membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif, il n\u2019y avait pas vraiment de raison qu\u2019il communique avec elle au travail.\n[13] Au dire de la plaignante, ces appels et visites visaient initialement \u00e0 discuter de moyens d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les op\u00e9rations du syndicat. Cependant, la conversation d\u00e9rivait vite vers des questions personnelles. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 la plaignante des d\u00e9tails au sujet de sa vie familiale. Il \u00e9tait n\u00e9 aux Indes orientales. Il lui a expliqu\u00e9 que son mariage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment aux coutumes propres \u00e0 sa culture. Au dire de la plaignante, ces conversations la distrayaient dans son travail et devenaient tr\u00e8s ennuyeuses. Elle lui demandait parfois de quitter mais, souvent, il restait devant sa porte et la fixait des yeux.\n[14] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de son curriculum vit\u00e6. Selon la plaignante, il a commenc\u00e9, dans les cinq jours qui ont suivi les \u00e9lections au sein de la section locale, \u00e0 lui demander de s\u2019asseoir avec lui pour examiner le document. Elle a accept\u00e9 et ils se sont rencontr\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet dans le bureau de la section locale un apr\u00e8s-midi apr\u00e8s le travail. La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle a finalement pass\u00e9 deux heures avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 au bureau. Il \u00e9tait devenu \u00e9vident \u00e0 ses yeux qu\u2019il ne voulait pas accepter certaines de ses recommandations simplement parce qu\u2019il cherchait \u00e0 prolonger la r\u00e9union pour passer plus de temps avec elle. Au cours des semaines qui ont suivi, il est revenu plusieurs fois \u00e0 la charge afin qu\u2019elle l\u2019aide \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 revoir son curriculum vit\u00e6, m\u00eame si elle lui avait dit qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait trop occup\u00e9e pour ce faire.\n(iii) L\u2019incident \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de l\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation de la plaignante [15] Le 10 mars 1998, la plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il s\u2019est produit un incident qui a modifi\u00e9 la nature de la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit : celle\u2011ci n\u2019\u00e9tait plus simplement contrariante et rev\u00eatait d\u00e9sormais un caract\u00e8re ouvertement sexuel. Ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, les routes \u00e9taient glac\u00e9es car il tombait de la pluie vergla\u00e7ante. Elle avait march\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au bureau de la section locale sur le chemin du retour \u00e0 la maison afin d\u2019aller v\u00e9rifier si elle avait re\u00e7u du courrier. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la section locale et elle a r\u00e9pondu au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Il lui a dit qu\u2019il allait venir pour ex\u00e9cuter certaines t\u00e2ches comptables. Il lui a fortement conseill\u00e9 de ne pas tenter de se rendre \u00e0 pied jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son appartement situ\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de l\u00e0 et d\u2019attendre qu\u2019il arrive, pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il la ram\u00e8nerait chez elle en voiture. La plaignante a d\u2019abord refus\u00e9, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9 a tellement insist\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a finalement accept\u00e9 son offre.\n[16] Au moment o\u00f9 la voiture est entr\u00e9e dans l\u2019all\u00e9e menant \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble o\u00f9 habitait la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui a demand\u00e9 o\u00f9 \u00e9tait son appartement et elle a point\u00e9 du doigt l\u2019endroit. Il s\u2019est alors tourn\u00e9 vers elle et lui a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il pouvait monter avec elle \u00e0 l\u2019appartement. Elle a dit que non, mais il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas de probl\u00e8me car il pouvait fort bien appeler sa femme pour lui dire qu\u2019il travaillerait tard. Il a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019elle pourrait lui offrir un verre. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle lui avait \u00e0 nouveau dit non, qu\u2019il ne pouvait monter \u00e0 son appartement et qu\u2019il devrait bien se comporter. Selon la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui aurait dit qu\u2019ils pourraient avoir des relations intimes. Il aurait ajouter : [TRADUCTION] : C\u2019est parfait si nous faisons l\u2019amour et [TRADUCTION] Ne me donneras\u2011tu pas m\u00eame un petit baiser?. Elle lui aurait \u00e0 nouveau r\u00e9pondu non, ce \u00e0 quoi il aurait r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait d\u2019autre choix que de l\u2019embrasser. Si elle refusait de le faire en priv\u00e9, il cr\u00e9erait une situation o\u00f9 il lui faudrait l\u2019embrasser en public. Elle est alors sortie de la voiture, fermant violemment la porti\u00e8re derri\u00e8re elle.\n[17] Elle \u00e9tait f\u00e2ch\u00e9e et boulevers\u00e9e. Cependant, ce qui l\u2019inqui\u00e9tait le plus, c\u2019est le fait qu\u2019elle lui avait indiqu\u00e9 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 se trouvait son appartement au rez\u2011de-chauss\u00e9e. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si d\u2019autres membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif et coll\u00e8gues de travail qui la connaissaient depuis des ann\u00e9es l\u2019avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconduite \u00e0 la maison, personne n\u2019\u00e9tait jamais entr\u00e9 ni m\u00eame n\u2019avait demand\u00e9 d\u2019entrer dans son appartement.\n(iv) Les visites et appels de l\u2019intim\u00e9 deviennent de nature sexuelle [18] Selon la plaignante, les appels et visites impromptus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas diminu\u00e9 durant les semaines qui ont suivi. Habituellement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui rendait visite une premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 7 h 30, au moment de son arriv\u00e9e au travail. Il lui rendait \u00e0 nouveau visite entre 9 h 30 et 10 h. Il se rendait \u00e0 son bureau une troisi\u00e8me fois \u00e0 midi puis, une derni\u00e8re fois, \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi. Il devenait plus entreprenant, affirmant \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019il \u00e9tait important pour lui qu\u2019il la voie tous les jours. Il disait qu\u2019il aimait telle ou telle robe qu\u2019elle portait et demandait qu\u2019elle la porte \u00e0 nouveau afin que ses [TRADUCTION] fantasmes se r\u00e9alisent. Il lui a dit qu\u2019il continuerait de la pourchasser jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que ses fantasmes deviennent r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Il lui a \u00e9galement dit qu\u2019il serait jaloux si elle avait une relation avec un autre homme. Il a lui conseill\u00e9 de ne rien dire au sujet de leur relation et que, si elle s\u2019avisait de le faire, il nierait la chose. Il lui a dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] un monde d\u2019hommes, qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de preuve et qu\u2019on ne la croirait jamais. Elle s\u2019employait \u00e0 lui r\u00e9p\u00e9ter qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de relation entre eux et que sa conduite \u00e9tait inacceptable. Cependant, il continuait de lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner et de lui rendre visite.\n[19] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 veillait toujours \u00e0 ce que personne d\u2019autre ne puisse entendre ce qu\u2019il disait. Lorsqu\u2019il venait la voir t\u00f4t le matin, il n\u2019y avait habituellement personne d\u2019autre dans les parages. La section de la plaignante comprenait plusieurs bureaux d\u00e9limit\u00e9s par des partitions. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le coll\u00e8gue qui occupait le bureau \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du sien \u00e9tait l\u00e9galement sourd. En outre, Richard Hudon, dont le bureau \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de plusieurs maladies et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s souffrant. Afin de moins sentir la douleur, il s\u2019effor\u00e7ait de se concentrer sur une chose \u00e0 la fois, habituellement son travail, et r\u00e9ussissait souvent de cette fa\u00e7on \u00e0 faire abstraction de tout ce qui se passait autour de lui.\n[20] Cela dit, M. Hudon a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin des visites fr\u00e9quentes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au bureau de la plaignante. Il a dit se souvenir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 rendait habituellement visite \u00e0 la plaignante trois quatre fois par jour et qu\u2019il conversait avec elle environ sept minutes chaque fois. Au d\u00e9but, M. Hudon pr\u00e9sumait que les conversations portaient sur des affaires du syndicat; toutefois, apr\u00e8s un certain temps, il a senti qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de questions de nature plus personnelle et s\u2019est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment efforc\u00e9 de ne pas entendre ce qui \u00e9tait dit.\n(v) La r\u00e9action des autres membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif du syndicat [21] La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que le lendemain de l\u2019incident survenu le 10 mars 1998 dans la voiture de l\u2019intim\u00e9, elle avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 ou parl\u00e9 en personne aux membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif suivants du syndicat pour se plaindre du comportement de ce dernier :\nX Jim Fraser \u2013 dirigeant \u00e0 temps plein et ex\u2011pr\u00e9sident de la section locale;\nX Dave Vaughan \u2013 vice-pr\u00e9sident de la section locale;\nX Tom Matchett \u2013 directeur r\u00e9gional, Ontario, du SEPC;\nX Jim Murray \u2013 pr\u00e9sident national du SEPC.\nTous ont dit \u00e0 la plaignante que sa r\u00e9action \u00e9tait excessive. Selon la plaignante, ils ne croyaient pas qu\u2019un gar\u00e7on aussi aimable et tranquille que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait pu faire ce genre de choses. M. Murray lui aurait m\u00eame dit : [TRADUCTION] Ne trouvez-vous pas agr\u00e9able d\u2019avoir un petit ami?, ajoutant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une question personnelle qu\u2019elle devrait r\u00e9soudre elle-m\u00eame, sans l\u2019intervention du syndicat.\n[22] Par cons\u00e9quent, elle s\u2019est rendu compte qu\u2019elle n\u2019obtiendrait gu\u00e8re de soutien de la part de ces hommes\u2011l\u00e0 et qu\u2019il lui faudrait s\u2019occuper elle-m\u00eame du cas de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 cela, elle a peu apr\u00e8s pris l\u2019habitude de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 M. Fraser ou \u00e0 M. Vaughan apr\u00e8s les visites impromptues de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Elle avait conclu que si ses coll\u00e8gues du syndicat ne voulaient pas l\u2019aider \u00e0 r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me du harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 son endroit, elle ferait en sorte qu\u2019ils subiraient eux-m\u00eame en tant soi peu le m\u00eame traitement.\n[23] Les quatre hommes ont tous t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ils ont confirm\u00e9 que la plaignante leur avait fait part de ses all\u00e9gations. Tous ont reconnu qu\u2019ils avaient plus ou moins bien compris ou saisi les probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s par la plaignante. MM. Vaughan et Fraser se sont particuli\u00e8rement excus\u00e9s de la fa\u00e7on dont ils ont r\u00e9agi \u00e0 ses plaintes. Ils ont tous deux confirm\u00e9 que la plaignante les avait appel\u00e9s plusieurs fois par jour durant une certaine p\u00e9riode pour se plaindre des derni\u00e8res visites impromptues de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n(vi) Le congr\u00e8s national du SEPC \u00e0 London, en Ontario [24] En mars 1998, le SEPC a tenu son congr\u00e8s national \u00e0 London, en Ontario. Y ont assist\u00e9 les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s suivants de la section locale : la plaignante, M. Fraser, M. Vaughan et le chef d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical, Ken Zarichansky. La veille de son d\u00e9part d\u2019Ottawa, la plaignante s\u2019est rendue au bureau de la section locale apr\u00e8s le travail pour v\u00e9rifier si elle avait re\u00e7u du courrier. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au bureau pendant qu\u2019elle s\u2019y trouvait. Selon la plaignante, il lui a demand\u00e9 si elle pourrait l\u2019amener avec elle au congr\u00e8s, ajoutant qu\u2019ils pourraient rester dans la chambre d\u2019h\u00f4tel et faire l\u2019amour. Il a dit que, dans le cas o\u00f9 il n\u2019irait pas l\u00e0\u2011bas avec elle, il lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phonerait \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4tel apr\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e pour s\u2019assurer que tout allait bien. Elle lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il ne viendrait pas avec elle et lui a dit de ne l\u2019appeler ni \u00e0 la maison ni \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4tel, puis a quitt\u00e9 le bureau.\n[25] Lorsqu\u2019elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison, elle a re\u00e7u un appel de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui lui a dit que M. Zarichansky \u00e9tait au bureau de la section locale et qu\u2019il voulait lui parler d\u2019un grief. Elle a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019elle lui avait dit express\u00e9ment de ne pas l\u2019appeler \u00e0 la maison et que M. Zarichansky pouvait lui-m\u00eame l\u2019appeler s\u2019il voulait lui parler.\n[26] Selon la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait alors au stade o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait obs\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de la voir. Par exemple, il se rendait tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quemment, selon elle, au bureau de la section locale dans l\u2019espoir de la rencontrer. Si la section locale recevait plusieurs factures \u00e0 payer, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019habitude de se rendre au bureau plusieurs jours d\u2019affil\u00e9e, pr\u00e9parant un ch\u00e8que \u00e0 chaque occasion, plut\u00f4t que de faire tous les ch\u00e8ques en m\u00eame temps. Il s\u2019\u00e9tait donc trouv\u00e9 une justification manifeste pour se rendre au bureau souvent le soir.\n(vii) Achat d\u2019un nouveau canap\u00e9 pour le bureau et de cadeaux pour la plaignante [27] La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019\u00e0 de nombreuses occasions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a propos\u00e9 \u00e0 la section locale plusieurs achats douteux, notamment celui d\u2019un nouveau canap\u00e9 pour le bureau. Le bureau avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une causeuse en bon \u00e9tat qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de remplacer. Selon la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui avait dit qu\u2019il voulait qu\u2019on ach\u00e8te un nouveau canap\u00e9, vraisemblablement plus long, sur lequel il pourrait faire l\u2019amour avec elle et d\u2019autres femmes.\n[28] M. Fraser a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait discut\u00e9 avec lui aussi de l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019acheter un nouveau canap\u00e9 sur lequel il pourrait s\u2019\u00e9tendre. M. Fraser a dit \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait inacceptable pour les membres qu\u2019on d\u00e9pense l\u2019argent du syndicat pour acheter un nouveau canap\u00e9 alors qu\u2019on en avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un. M. Fraser et d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 lors de leur t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il y avait, tant dans l\u2019immeuble du CTC que dans les \u00e9difices de Postes Canada, des postes de soins infirmiers dot\u00e9s de petits lits o\u00f9 les employ\u00e9s pouvaient se rendre s\u2019ils sentaient le besoin de se reposer.\n[29] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 compter d\u2019avril 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 dire que la section locale devrait lui acheter une robe et des fleurs pour son anniversaire, qu\u2019elle allait c\u00e9l\u00e9brer en mai. Il a \u00e9galement propos\u00e9 que le syndicat organise une f\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de son anniversaire. Elle lui a dit \u00e0 maintes reprises que ses suggestions \u00e9taient d\u00e9plac\u00e9es.\n[30] MM. Hudon, Vaughan et Fraser se souviennent d\u2019\u00eatre all\u00e9s manger un jour dans un restaurant avec d\u2019autres membres de la section locale, dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la plaignante. Pendant qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient tous \u00e0 table, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a dit que la section locale devrait acheter une robe \u00e0 la plaignante et lui organiser une f\u00eate. Selon M. Hudon, la suggestion a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sur un ton s\u00e9rieux et non \u00e0 la blague. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la suggestion avait aussit\u00f4t mis fin \u00e0 la conversation. M. Fraser et la plaignante ont dit \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 que sa suggestion \u00e9tait d\u00e9plac\u00e9e.\n[31] M. Fraser a aussi indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait plusieurs fois \u00e9voqu\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019acheter des fleurs et une robe \u00e0 la plaignante. M. Fraser se souvient de s\u2019\u00eatre alors demand\u00e9 comment l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de famille, pouvait proposer d\u2019offrir des cadeaux aussi personnels que des fleurs ou une robe.\n[32] Selon la plaignante, la section locale n\u2019a finalement pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la suggestion de lui organiser une f\u00eate ou de lui acheter des cadeaux de cette nature.\n(viii) L\u2019incident survenu le 18 avril 1998 au bureau de la section locale [33] Afin de moderniser ses pratiques comptables, la section locale avait fait l\u2019acquisition du logiciel Quicken. Ce logiciel, qu\u2019on trouve facilement dans les magasins de d\u00e9tail et qui permet \u00e0 des utilisateurs non avertis de suivre leurs op\u00e9rations bancaires et autres transactions personnelles, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9 sur l\u2019ordinateur de la section locale. On s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 titre de tr\u00e9sorier, utilise le logiciel en question.\n[34] D\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 connaissait fort bien en 1998 divers programmes informatiques utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 Postes Canada, lesquels \u00e9taient, \u00e0 tous les points de vue, beaucoup plus complexes que Quicken. Le superviseur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, Franco Chiumera, a affirm\u00e9 lors son t\u00e9moignage que ce dernier avait passablement de facilit\u00e9 \u00e0 se familiariser avec des programmes informatiques et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait, en fait, plus dou\u00e9 que d\u2019autres de ce point de vue. Entre 1999 et 2001, le superviseur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait Alex Eloise. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, ce dernier a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait le membre de son \u00e9quipe qui se d\u00e9brouillait le mieux en informatique et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2me de la section au plan informatique. En outre, M. Eloise a confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 pouvait ma\u00eetriser rapidement le fonctionnement de nouveaux logiciels.\n[35] Au d\u00e9but d\u2019avril 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est all\u00e9 trouver la plaignante pour lui demander de l\u2019initier \u00e0 Quicken au bureau de la section locale, apr\u00e8s les heures de travail. Elle a refus\u00e9, expliquant qu\u2019elle ne connaissait pas vraiment le logiciel elle-m\u00eame. Il a n\u00e9anmoins insist\u00e9 pour qu\u2019elle le fasse. Selon la plaignante, qui a depuis eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019utiliser Quicken, ce logiciel est tellement simple qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019en apprendre elle-m\u00eame le fonctionnement en moins de dix minutes.\n[36] La plaignante a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 une coll\u00e8gue de travail, Mary Sue Allen, qui connaissait d\u00e9j\u00e0 le logiciel puisqu\u2019elle l\u2019utilisait \u00e0 la maison pour g\u00e9rer les finances de sa famille, et lui a demand\u00e9 de rencontrer l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour lui donner une certaine formation. Lorsqu\u2019elle a communiqu\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois avec l\u2019intim\u00e9, Mme Allen lui a dit qu\u2019il serait peut-\u00eatre plus utile qu\u2019il lise le manuel en direct ou suive un cours de formation professionnelle. Selon Mme Allen, il a rejet\u00e9 sa suggestion et insist\u00e9 pour qu\u2019elle lui donne la formation. L\u2019intim\u00e9 et elle se sont donn\u00e9s rendez-vous le samedi 18 avril 1998, \u00e0 13 h, au bureau de la section locale.\n[37] Comme la date de la rencontre approchait, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019inqui\u00e9ter de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de Mme Allen, compte tenu des commentaires ant\u00e9rieurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 son d\u00e9sir de faire l\u2019amour sur le canap\u00e9 du bureau de la section locale. La plaignante a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se rendre au bureau ce samedi\u2011l\u00e0 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que rien de f\u00e2cheux n\u2019arrive \u00e0 Mme Allen. Ce que ne savait pas la plaignante, c\u2019est que Mme Allen nourrissait elle-m\u00eame des inqui\u00e9tudes. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019insistance de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle lui donne la formation lui avait mis la puce \u00e0 l\u2019oreille. Dans la matin\u00e9e du 18 avril, elle lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 et a annul\u00e9 la rencontre.\n[38] Ne sachant pas que la rencontre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e, la plaignante s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au bureau de la section locale vers 13 h, heure \u00e0 laquelle devait d\u00e9buter la s\u00e9ance de formation. L\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait alors assis devant le pupitre et avait devant lui une bouteille de bi\u00e8re ouverte. \u00c0 en juger au ton de sa voix, il \u00e9tait \u00e9m\u00e9ch\u00e9 mais il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ivre. Il a dit \u00e0 la plaignante que Mme Allen avait annul\u00e9 la s\u00e9ance de formation. Alors que la plaignante s\u2019appr\u00eatait \u00e0 quitter le bureau, l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui a dit qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9couvert un probl\u00e8me en ce qui touche les demandes d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de M. Fraser. La plaignante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 M. Fraser \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle s\u2019est assise au bureau et l\u2019intim\u00e9 se tenait debout derri\u00e8re elle pendant qu\u2019ils conversaient \u00e0 l\u2019aide du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone mains libres. M. Fraser a confirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que cette conversation avait bel et bien eu lieu et avait dur\u00e9 une dizaine ou une quinzaine de minutes.\n[39] Une fois la conversation termin\u00e9e, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante, qui \u00e9tait encore assise, de bouger sa chaise afin qu\u2019il puisse avoir acc\u00e8s au tableau d\u2019affichage derri\u00e8re elle. Elle lui a fait un peu de place, mais il a pouss\u00e9 sa chaise vers l\u2019avant, disant qu\u2019il avait besoin de plus d\u2019espace. Elle s\u2019est alors retrouv\u00e9e contre le pupitre, incapable de bouger ou de se lever. \u00c0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, il l\u2019a empoign\u00e9e par les avant-bras et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui embrasser les cheveux, la t\u00eate et le cou. Elle lui a cri\u00e9 de lui ficher la paix, mais il n\u2019a pas obtemp\u00e9r\u00e9. Il lui a dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en amour avec elle et qu\u2019elle devait accepter d\u2019avoir une relation sexuelle avec lui. Elle lui a alors demand\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau de lui ficher la paix et d\u2019aller devant le pupitre. Il a \u00e0 nouveau refus\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut menac\u00e9 d\u2019appeler la police, il a rel\u00e2ch\u00e9 son \u00e9treinte et s\u2019est rendu de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du pupitre. La plaignante lui a dit que sa conduite \u00e9tait d\u00e9plac\u00e9e et allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement de l\u2019AFPC et qu\u2019il pourrait faire l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires. Il a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il allait la forcer \u00e0 l\u2019embrasser. Elle a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019embrasserait pas et qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas avoir de relation sexuelle avec lui.\n[40] \u00c0 ce moment, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019il avait cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir le poste de tr\u00e9sorier uniquement parce qu\u2019il voulait lui faire la cour. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, dans son pays d\u2019origine, il n\u2019y avait rien de mal \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ait une relation avec elle. Il lui a \u00e9galement r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pouvait parler de sa conduite \u00e0 n\u2019importe qui, qu\u2019on ne la croirait pas et que c\u2019\u00e9tait un monde d\u2019hommes o\u00f9 la parole d\u2019une femme n\u2019importe pas. Elle lui a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il contrevenait \u00e0 la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement de l\u2019AFPC et qu\u2019il devait cesser imm\u00e9diatement ces agissements. Ensuite, elle a quitt\u00e9 le bureau. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, elle a dit qu\u2019elle avait gard\u00e9 son calme durant l\u2019incident. Elle n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas moins boulevers\u00e9e. Lorsqu\u2019elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 son appartement, elle [TRADUCTION] s\u2019est mise en boule et a \u00e9clat\u00e9 en sanglots. Elle a song\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 la police, mais elle a jug\u00e9 que cela ne donnerait rien puisque ce serait sa parole contre la sienne. Selon la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019avait empoign\u00e9e tellement fort qu\u2019elle avait des meurtrissures sur les bras. En fait, M. Hudon se souvient d\u2019avoir remarqu\u00e9 au travail que l\u2019un des avant-bras de la plaignante \u00e9tait meurtri, mais il ne se souvent pas exactement \u00e0 quel moment il a observ\u00e9 cela.\n(ix) La lettre du 19 avril 1998 de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 [41] Comme ses avertissements verbaux n\u2019avaient pas donn\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats escompt\u00e9s, la plaignante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prendre des mesures plus concr\u00e8tes. Le dimanche 19 avril 1998, soit le lendemain de l\u2019incident, elle a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 \u00e0 son intention une lettre qu\u2019elle a imprim\u00e9e sur le papier en\u2011t\u00eate de la section locale et qui se lisait comme suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nObjet : Commentaires de nature sexuelle importuns\nLe 26 mars, le 18 avril et \u00e0 plusieurs autres occasions, vous m\u2019avez fait des commentaires de nature sexuelle importuns. Vous m\u2019avez dit tant\u00f4t que j\u2019\u00e9tais belle, tant\u00f4t que je ne devais fr\u00e9quenter personne d\u2019autre, tant\u00f4t que je devais avoir une relation sexuelle avec vous.\nJe vous ai dit au moins quatre fois de vous abstenir de faire ce genre de commentaires. Le 18 avril 1998, je vous ai expliqu\u00e9 que votre conduite contrevenait aux Statuts de l\u2019AFPC et \u00e0 la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement de l\u2019AFPC. Vous trouverez ci\u2011joint copie de la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement de l\u2019AFPC et de l\u2019article 25 des Statuts de l\u2019AFPC qui porte sur la discipline et qui d\u00e9crit les mesures qui pourraient \u00eatre prises si vous ne mettez pas fin \u00e0 ce comportement.\nVos commentaires de nature sexuelle sont injustifi\u00e9s et importuns. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que je vous ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de cesser votre man\u00e8ge et que vous ne l\u2019avez pas fait, j\u2019estime que vous me harcelez sexuellement.\nJe m\u2019attends \u00e0 ce que vous vous comportiez d\u00e9sormais avec moi de fa\u00e7on professionnelle, car il est inconvenant que vous continuiez de me faire des commentaires de nature sexuelle.\nSinc\u00e8rement,\n[signature] Connie Bushey pr\u00e9sidente, Section locale 70180\nLa lettre indique que des copies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 MM. Vaughan, Fraser, Murray et Matchett.\n[42] Dans sa lettre, la plaignante ne fait pas \u00e9tat du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 incident \u2013 contact physique. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 au cours de son t\u00e9moignage que le bureau du pr\u00e9sident de la section locale \u00e9tait un endroit tr\u00e8s public et qu\u2019elle tenait \u00e0 ce que ses probl\u00e8mes personnels demeurent priv\u00e9s. En outre, elle craignait qu\u2019en disant qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 agress\u00e9e, l\u2019on puisse se servir de cela contre elle, et que, comme il n\u2019y avait pas de t\u00e9moins, personne ne la croirait. Le lundi 20 avril 1998, la plaignante a remis la lettre \u00e0 MM. Fraser et Vaughan en leur demandant de bien vouloir la transmettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 en cong\u00e9 annuel.\n[43] Le mardi 21 avril 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e0 son bureau t\u00f4t en matin\u00e9e. Il lui a dit qu\u2019il voulait lui parler au sujet de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 samedi. Elle a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas lui parler et qu\u2019il devait la laisser tranquille et ne pas communiquer avec elle. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui a envoy\u00e9 un courriel (\u00e0 9 h 11, selon l\u2019heure indiqu\u00e9e) qui se lisait comme suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJe suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9. Souhaite-moi bonne chance pour mon examen. J\u2019ai encore du respect pour toi.\nArvind.\n[44] L\u2019intim\u00e9 devait se pr\u00e9senter plus tard ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 \u00e0 un examen dans le cadre d\u2019un concours. Selon la plaignante, il n\u2019\u00e9tait survenu aucun probl\u00e8me jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 en ce qui touche le travail effectu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme tr\u00e9sorier et, par cons\u00e9quent, ses excuses ne pouvaient concerner que l\u2019incident du 18 avril.\n[45] \u00c0 11 h, apparemment apr\u00e8s que MM. Fraser et Vaughan eurent demand\u00e9 de le rencontrer, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour lui dire qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le droit de leur raconter ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. Il a affirm\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait lui qui \u00e9tait victime de harc\u00e8lement et a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019on ne la croirait jamais. Elle a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il avait continu\u00e9 \u00e0 se conduire de fa\u00e7on inconvenante, malgr\u00e9 ses avertissements. Elle n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que de porter l\u2019affaire \u00e0 un \u00e9chelon sup\u00e9rieur.\n[46] MM. Fraser et Vaughan ont rencontr\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 le 21 avril \u00e0 l\u2019heure du d\u00e9jeuner. Ils lui ont remis la lettre en lui disant que sa conduite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plaignante \u00e9tait importune. Ils lui ont conseill\u00e9 de cesser ce comportement et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, de ne plus communiquer avec elle pour d\u2019autres choses que des affaires syndicales. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a ni\u00e9 avoir fait quoi que ce soit de r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. Il a offert sa d\u00e9mission \u00e0 titre de tr\u00e9sorier, mais MM. Fraser et Vaughan lui ont dit qu\u2019il faisait du bon travail et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il d\u00e9missionne. M. Vaughan se souvient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a alors convenu de ne plus importuner la plaignante. On a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait peut-\u00eatre de mise qu\u2019il pr\u00e9sente des excuses \u00e0 la plaignante, tout en lui pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il devait s\u2019abstenir de lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner ce jour\u2011l\u00e0.\n[47] Il y avait ce soir\u2011l\u00e0 une r\u00e9union de d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s syndicaux au bureau de la section locale. La plaignante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas y assister. L\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait du nombre des participants. Vers 17 h 30, la plaignante a re\u00e7u un appel de lui \u00e0 la maison. Il lui a dit qu\u2019il assistait \u00e0 la r\u00e9union, qu\u2019on avait command\u00e9 d\u2019autres pizzas et qu\u2019elle devrait venir en manger. Elle lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019on lui avait enjoint formellement de ne pas lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner. Il a dit qu\u2019il voulait s\u2019excuser de son comportement et qu\u2019il avait besoin d\u2019entendre sa voix. Elle lui a dit de ne pas la rappeler et a raccroch\u00e9.\n[48] Le 22 avril 1998, la plaignante a re\u00e7u une lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui se lisait comme suit (le texte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 ni corrig\u00e9) :\n[TRADUCTION]\nDestinataire : Connie Bushey\nExp\u00e9diteur : Arvind Sharma\nObjet : Conduite importune\nConnie, je suis tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sol\u00e9 et je veux m\u2019excuser pour toutes les difficult\u00e9s que j\u2019ai pu te causer.

Elle \u00e9tait occup\u00e9e au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Il lui a laiss\u00e9 un message sur un papillon autocollant Post-It qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sur son pupitre. La note se lisait comme suit (texte int\u00e9gral) :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJe t\u2019en prie, appelle-moi, pour me dire que tu m\u2019as pardonn\u00e9. Connie, je ne te ferai jamais de mal.\nMerci.\nArvind.\nLa plaignante a jet\u00e9 la note dans la poubelle, puis l\u2019intim\u00e9 a quitt\u00e9 son bureau. Elle a ult\u00e9rieurement r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 la note, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[49] Plus tard ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, vers 15 h, la plaignante a rencontr\u00e9 MM. Fraser et Vaughan au bureau de la section locale. MM. Fraser et M. Vaughan ont t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 au moyen de l\u2019appareil mains libres. MM. Fraser et Vaughan l\u2019ont enguirland\u00e9 pour avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et lui ont r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait cesser de communiquer avec elle pour des affaires qui ne concernaient pas le syndicat. Ils lui ont dit \u00e9galement qu\u2019il devait retourner la carte d\u2019affaires de la plaignante sur laquelle \u00e9tait inscrit son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 la maison \u2013 non publi\u00e9 \u2013 et qu\u2019elle lui avait remise au moment o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait devenu tr\u00e9sorier. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a alors convenu de mettre fin \u00e0 son comportement r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible et de retourner la carte d\u2019affaires.\n[50] Le lendemain (24 avril 1998), l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9crit \u00e0 MM. Fraser et Vaughan la lettre suivante (texte int\u00e9gral) :\n[TRADUCTION]\nDestinataire : Confr\u00e8re Jim\/Dave\nJim, je voulais te parler mais j\u2019\u00e9tais avec mon patron, je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9, Jim\/Dave, je ne veux faire de mal \u00e0 personne. Ne me pr\u00eatez pas d\u2019intentions, je vous prie. J\u2019ai une excellente r\u00e9putation au bureau et je respecte les autres. J\u2019ai en main la carte de Connie que je vous remettrai demain et je ferai en sorte de m\u00e9riter son respect afin qu\u2019elle me la redonne. Je n\u2019ai rien fait de mal. Je ne t\u00e9l\u00e9phonerai pas \u00e0 Connie lorsque je serai au bureau. Je prendrai rendez-vous et je me montrerai respectueux. J\u2019esp\u00e8re que vous me comprenez. Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 vous remettre la cl\u00e9 et le laissez-passer du bureau, si c\u2019est ce que vous voulez.\nVoil\u00e0, c\u2019est tout. Croyez bien que je suis sinc\u00e8re. Je veux me montrer respectueux. Je ne suis pas mauvais.\nMerci, Arvind.\nLe lendemain, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a effectivement retourn\u00e9 la carte d\u2019affaires de la plaignante. MM. Vaughan et Fraser n\u2019ont pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de remettre sa cl\u00e9 et son laissez-passer.\n(x) Les changements dans le comportement de la plaignante [51] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que les faits et gestes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019ont contrainte \u00e0 changer beaucoup de choses dans sa vie. Elle r\u00e9sidait \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de son bureau et avait l\u2019habitude de marcher pour se rendre au travail. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident du 18 avril, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 utiliser sa voiture pour se rendre au travail, craignant d\u2019\u00eatre agress\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 en cours de route.\n[52] Elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 ne jamais plus faire en sorte de se retrouver seule avec l\u2019intim\u00e9. Elle a donc inform\u00e9 son chef, Gilles S\u00e9guin, des probl\u00e8mes que lui causait l\u2019intim\u00e9. M. S\u00e9guin lui a dit que si l\u2019intim\u00e9 se pr\u00e9sentait \u00e0 son bureau, elle pourrait quitter son cubicule et venir \u00e0 son bureau ou se r\u00e9fugier dans l\u2019aire commune de la section. Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 ci\u2011dessous, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait recommenc\u00e9 en mai 1998 ses visites quotidiennes \u00e0 son bureau. Elle a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son bureau aux heures o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait susceptible de s\u2019y pr\u00e9senter. Elle se rendait ailleurs, notamment \u00e0 la cantine. Afin de compenser le temps perdu durant la journ\u00e9e, pendant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait ailleurs que dans son cubicule, elle devait rester au bureau apr\u00e8s ses heures normales de travail.\n[53] La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle a \u00e9galement cess\u00e9 de se rendre seule au bureau de la section locale. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, M. Fraser terminait sa journ\u00e9e de travail vers 16 h. La plaignante devait d\u00e9sormais vaquer aux t\u00e2ches syndicales au bureau de la section locale avant le d\u00e9part de M. Fraser, ce qui l\u2019obligeait souvent \u00e0 partir plus t\u00f4t de l\u2019immeuble de Postes Canada.\n[54] Elle soutient que tous ces changements ont nui \u00e0 son rendement professionnel ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de s\u2019acquitter de ses fonctions de pr\u00e9sidente.\n(xi) Poursuite des agissements de l\u2019intim\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident du 18 avril 1998 [55] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que dans les jours qui ont suivi l\u2019envoi de sa lettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et ses conversations avec MM. Fraser et Vaughan, au cours desquelles il avait convenu de ne communiquer avec elle que pour des affaires syndicales, ses visites, appels et autres communications impromptues au sujet de questions qui n\u2019avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec les activit\u00e9s de la section locale ont recommenc\u00e9.\n[56] Le 28 avril 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante un courriel pr\u00e9sentant les grandes lignes d\u2019un cours de gestion offert aux femmes \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Carleton. Au d\u00e9but du message, l\u2019intim\u00e9 affirmait qu\u2019elle devrait aller suivre ce cours. \u00c0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, il lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 afin qu\u2019ils aillent ensemble acheter deux classeurs pour le bureau de la section locale. Elle lui a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019acheter de nouveaux classeurs mais que s\u2019il insistait sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de cet achat il devait en discuter avec M. Fraser et se rendre avec ce dernier au magasin. Selon la plaignante, cette demande constituait une autre tentative de sa part pour se retrouver seul avec elle.\n[57] En mai 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui rendre visite \u00e0 son bureau. Elle all\u00e8gue que ses propos lors de ces visites \u00e9taient habituellement de nature sexuelle. Il lui racontait ses fantasmes sexuels \u00e0 son sujet, d\u00e9crivait ses positions sexuelles pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es et demandait sans cesse d\u2019avoir une relation sexuelle avec elle. Elle lui r\u00e9pondait toujours qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas de relation sexuelle avec lui tout en lui rappelant qu\u2019on l\u2019avait averti qu\u2019il devait cesser de se conduire ainsi.\n[58] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 son bureau, qu\u2019il lui avait dit qu\u2019il voulait avoir une relation sexuelle avec elle et qu\u2019il ne la laisserait pas tranquille tant qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019aurait pas fait. Elle lui a cri\u00e9 de d\u00e9guerpir de son bureau et de cesser de se comporter de cette fa\u00e7on. Elle parlait tellement fort qu\u2019elle a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention de M. Hudon et que celui\u2011ci s\u2019est lev\u00e9 pour venir voir ce qui se passait dans le cubicule adjacent. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Hudon a dit se souvenir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 \u00e0 toute vapeur devant lui en sortant du bureau de la plaignante. Par contre, la plaignante a dit se rappeler que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait encore dans son bureau lorsque M. Hudon y a p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9. Elle s\u2019est retourn\u00e9 vers l\u2019intim\u00e9 et lui a dit : [TRADUCTION] Vas\u2011y Arvind, dis-lui, dis-lui que tu exiges de faire l\u2019amour avec moi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a ni\u00e9 l\u2019accusation et est sorti du bureau prestement.\n[59] Elle \u00e9tait tellement boulevers\u00e9e que M. Hudon a d\u00fb s\u2019asseoir \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019elle pour la calmer. Il se souvient qu\u2019elle [TRADUCTION] pleurait avec des sanglots et que ses propos \u00e9taient quelque peu incoh\u00e9rents. Il a tent\u00e9 de la r\u00e9conforter; cependant, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait un de ses amis assez intimes, il n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 bon \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 de s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9.\n[60] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Hudon a indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui demandait o\u00f9 se trouvait la plaignante lorsqu\u2019il venait pour la voir et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 son bureau. M. Hudon refusait de r\u00e9pondre, la plaignante lui ayant express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 de ne rien dire de ses all\u00e9es et venues. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 laissait de nombreux messages dans la bo\u00eete vocale de la plaignante, disant souvent qu\u2019il avait besoin de lui parler et d\u2019entendre sa voix.\n[61] L\u2019AFPC a tenu une r\u00e9union \u00e0 Hull durant un week-end de mai 1998. Y ont assist\u00e9 quatre membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale, dont la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9. La plaignante a amen\u00e9 tout le monde dans sa voiture. Sur le chemin du retour, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait plusieurs allusions \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de cours du Coll\u00e8ge des travailleurs que la plaignante devait suivre \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 d\u2019Ottawa. Elle devrait r\u00e9sider sur le campus de l\u2019universit\u00e9 pendant la formation, qui devait durer un mois \u00e0 compter du 25 mai. Le vice-pr\u00e9sident, M. Vaughan, devait assumer ses fonctions et responsabilit\u00e9s syndicales en son absence. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il voulait obtenir son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et son adresse sur le campus afin qu\u2019il puisse lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner le jour et venir lui rendre visite avec sa femme en soir\u00e9e. La plaignante lui a dit qu\u2019elle ne lui donnerait pas ces renseignements. Il l\u2019a alors pri\u00e9e instamment de les lui fournir tout en faisant remarquer qu\u2019elle r\u00e9agissait de fa\u00e7on grossi\u00e8re et \u00e9go\u00efste. Finalement, l\u2019un des autres membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif, M. Zarichansky, est intervenu et a dit, sur un ton relativement ferme, que la plaignante avait manifestement dit non \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et qu\u2019il devrait la laisser tranquille.\n[62] \u00c0 la fin du cours au Coll\u00e8ge des travailleurs, il y a eu une c\u00e9r\u00e9monie de remise de dipl\u00f4mes \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9. Plusieurs membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale y ont assist\u00e9, notamment M. Fraser, M. Zarichansky et l\u2019intim\u00e9. Jetant un regard sur l\u2019auditoire ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, la plaignante a vu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 tenait dans ses mains un gros bouquet de roses. Elle craignait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait l\u2019intention de lui offrir les fleurs dont il parlait depuis des mois et qu\u2019il r\u00e9ussisse finalement \u00e0 l\u2019embrasser en public, comme il le lui avait dit lorsqu\u2019il l\u2019avait ramen\u00e9e chez elle en voiture en mars. Elle \u00e9tait apeur\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de ne pouvoir \u00e9viter qu\u2019il l\u2019\u00e9treigne. Heureusement, la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie a dur\u00e9 tellement longtemps que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00fb quitter pour aller c\u00e9l\u00e9brer l\u2019anniversaire de son enfant. Il a remis le bouquet \u00e0 M. Fraser. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Fraser, c\u2019est l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui avait apport\u00e9 le bouquet, qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 avec l\u2019argent de la section locale.\n[63] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne sachant pas comment la joindre \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9, la plaignante n\u2019a pas eu de ses nouvelles pendant toute la dur\u00e9e du cours de formation. Lorsqu\u2019elle est retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 son bureau de Postes Canada vers la fin de juin 1998, elle avait dans sa bo\u00eete vocale de nombreux messages de l\u2019intim\u00e9 indiquant qu\u2019il avait besoin d\u2019entendre sa voix et lui demandant de l\u2019appeler. Elle avait \u00e9galement re\u00e7u un courriel en date du 12 juin 1998. Le message en question n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec les activit\u00e9s syndicales. Un fichier renfermant un jeu-questionnaire y \u00e9tait annex\u00e9. Le message comportait un commentaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 indiquant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait s\u00fbr que la plaignante obtiendrait un score de 98 % \u00e0 ce jeu.\n(xii) \u00c9v\u00e9nements post\u00e9rieurs au retour de la plaignante du Coll\u00e8ge des travailleurs [64] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des appels \u00e0 la plaignante d\u00e8s son retour au travail. Chaque fois, elle lui r\u00e9p\u00e9tait qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas qu\u2019il lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Parfois, lorsqu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 son bureau, l\u2019intim\u00e9 laissait des messages dans sa bo\u00eete vocale, demandant qu\u2019elle le rappelle. Selon la plaignante, le ton de ces messages d\u00e9notait une certaine anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Chaque fois qu\u2019il r\u00e9ussissait \u00e0 lui parler, il lui expliquait souvent que tout ce qu\u2019il voulait, c\u2019\u00e9tait entendre sa voix. Lorsqu\u2019elle recevait des appels de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la plaignante t\u00e9l\u00e9phonait immanquablement \u00e0 M. Fraser et \u00e0 M. Vaughan. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le comportement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle en \u00e9tait venue \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il \u00e9tait obs\u00e9d\u00e9 par elle. Elle a alors discut\u00e9 avec M. Fraser et M. Vaughan de la possibilit\u00e9 de restreindre l\u2019acc\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au bureau de la section locale en lui retirant son laissez-passer et ses cl\u00e9s; cependant, ils ont estim\u00e9 que ce serait l\u00e0 une r\u00e9action excessive et peut-\u00eatre une atteinte \u00e0 ses droits.\n[65] La section locale avait fait l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un nouvel ordinateur en juillet 1998. Un progiciel grandement utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada y a \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9. Ce progiciel comprenait le tableur \u00e9lectronique Lotus. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour lui demander de l\u2019initier au fonctionnement du tableur. Elle a carr\u00e9ment refus\u00e9, d\u2019autant plus que le logiciel en question faisait partie d\u2019un progiciel qu\u2019il utilisait d\u00e9j\u00e0 vraisemblablement dans son travail \u00e0 Postes Canada. Elle a vu dans sa demande une autre excuse pour se retrouver seul avec elle dans une pi\u00e8ce.\n[66] L\u2019intim\u00e9 si\u00e9geait comme repr\u00e9sentant syndical au comit\u00e9 mixte de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Ce comit\u00e9 devait notamment inspecter annuellement du point de vue de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 les lieux de travail des employ\u00e9s de Postes Canada. Le 16 juillet 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 et un repr\u00e9sentant de la direction ont men\u00e9 l\u2019inspection annuelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage de la plaignante dans la tour Est. La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019\u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, elle a lev\u00e9 les yeux et a vu l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui se tenait dans l\u2019entr\u00e9e de son cubicule et qui la fixait des yeux tout en \u00e9coutant la conversation. Il lui a dit qu\u2019elle semblait de mauvaise humeur et a indiqu\u00e9 que le syndicat devrait lui acheter des fleurs pour lui remonter le moral. Elle lui a rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau qu\u2019un tel achat serait inopportun et qu\u2019elle lui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit dans sa lettre de cesser de faire de tels commentaires.\n[67] Ayant acquis la conviction que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait obs\u00e9d\u00e9 par elle, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 craindre pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Elle a alors apport\u00e9 d\u2019autres changements \u00e0 son mode de vie. Par exemple, elle a cess\u00e9 de faire de la marche et du jogging \u00e0 l\u2019heure du d\u00e9jeuner, craignant de rencontrer l\u2019intim\u00e9. Elle a \u00e9galement cess\u00e9 d\u2019aller au parc de Mooney\u2019s Bay, qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e8s de son appartement, sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y rendait souvent avec sa famille. Elle a m\u00eame song\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale, tellement elle \u00e9tait frustr\u00e9e par la r\u00e9ticence de ses confr\u00e8res \u00e0 intervenir.\n[68] Son inqui\u00e9tude a \u00e9t\u00e9 aviv\u00e9e par certaines d\u00e9clarations faites par l\u2019intim\u00e9 vers la fin de juin ou le d\u00e9but de juillet 1998 au sujet de son d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement imminent. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a inform\u00e9 la plaignante qu\u2019il envisageait de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 un endroit qui se trouvait \u00e0 seulement dix minutes de sa r\u00e9sidence. Selon la plaignante, il lui avait dit qu\u2019il r\u00e9siderait tellement proche d\u2019elle qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de venir la voir le week-end et le soir. Selon la preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 et sa famille ont bel et bien emm\u00e9nag\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 1998 dans une maison appartenant au p\u00e8re de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait situ\u00e9e \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de l\u2019appartement de la plaignante.\n[69] Le vendredi 17 juillet 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante. Il lui a dit qu\u2019il la verrait le lendemain. Elle lui a fait remarquer que le lendemain \u00e9tait un samedi et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de le voir. Il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il envisageait de lui rendre visite. Elle a tenu pour acquis qu\u2019il comptait se rendre \u00e0 son appartement. Elle l\u2019a averti de se tenir loin. Au cours du week-end, elle a fait en sorte de ne pas \u00eatre chez elle, au cas o\u00f9 il tenterait de venir lui rendre visite. Le lundi suivant (20 juillet), l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 t\u00f4t en matin\u00e9e pour lui demander si elle avait eu un bon week-end.\n[70] Elle \u00e9tait alors tr\u00e8s inqui\u00e8te, estimant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne se contentait plus de la harceler au travail et empi\u00e9tait sur sa vie priv\u00e9e. Elle a donc \u00e9crit une deuxi\u00e8me lettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 (en date du 20 juillet 1998) qu\u2019elle a imprim\u00e9e sur le papier en\u2011t\u00eate de la section locale et qui se lisait comme suit (version originale int\u00e9grale) :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLe 20 juillet 1998\nArvind Sharma\nObjet : Poursuite de la conduite importune\nEn avril 1998, vous avez re\u00e7u une lettre d\u2019avertissement au sujet de votre conduite et de vos commentaires importuns \u00e0 mon endroit. \u00c0 mon avis, il n\u2019y a pas eu au cours des trois derniers mois d\u2019am\u00e9lioration en ce qui touche vos commentaires ou votre conduite \u00e0 mon endroit.\nJ\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 que vous vous rendez au bureau de la section locale plusieurs fois par semaine. J\u2019ai personnellement constat\u00e9 que vous allez l\u00e0\u2011bas pour signer un ch\u00e8que et que vous y retournez le lendemain pour ex\u00e9cuter une autre petite t\u00e2che. Si vous vous rendez aussi souvent au bureau, il me semble, c\u2019est parce que cherchez l\u2019occasion de vous retrouver seul avec moi. Compte tenu de votre premier \u00e9cart de conduite, je ne me sens plus en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 lorsque je me rends le soir ou le week-end au bureau de la section locale. Cette situation est surtout attribuable au fait que je ne sais pas si vous serez l\u00e0\u2011bas et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quel genre de commentaires vous m\u2019adresserez ou quel genre de comportement vous manifesterez \u00e0 mon endroit. Votre comportement nuit \u00e0 mon rendement en tant que pr\u00e9sidente de la section locale ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du service que la section locale offre aux membres.\nVous m\u2019avez adress\u00e9 des commentaires \u00e0 plusieurs occasions, mais c\u2019est la semaine derni\u00e8re que vous m\u2019avez fait les commentaires les plus importuns et inqui\u00e9tants. Lorsque vous m\u2019avez dit qu\u2019il fallait que je vous donne une formation sur l\u2019ordinateur, je vous ai indiqu\u00e9 fermement et \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que je n\u2019entendais pas le faire. Vous m\u2019avez r\u00e9pondu que je devais vous donner cette formation et que le formateur devait \u00eatre moi-m\u00eame. J\u2019ai dit NON \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, mais vous continuez d\u2019insister. Vous devriez comprendre, car NON est un mot tr\u00e8s simple. Comme vous \u00eates tr\u00e8s vers\u00e9 en informatique et que vous savez vous servir d\u2019un ordinateur, je ne crois que vous ayez besoin d\u2019une telle formation. Je m\u2019interroge vraiment quant aux raisons pour lesquelles vous insistez pour que je sois celle qui vous donne cette formation. \u00c0 mon avis, c\u2019est l\u00e0 le dernier plan \u00e9chafaud\u00e9 pour vous retrouver seul avec moi. Je ne veux pas que vous envisagiez ou imaginiez \u00e0 l\u2019avenir des situations o\u00f9 je me retrouverai seule avec vous.\nLe jeudi 16 juillet, vous m\u2019avez dit que la section locale devrait m\u2019acheter des fleurs pour me remonter le moral. Cette situation s\u2019apparente \u00e0 celle o\u00f9 vous vouliez que la section locale m\u2019ach\u00e8te des fleurs et une robe pour mon anniversaire. On vous a expliqu\u00e9 que moi-m\u00eame et les autres membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale jugeons une telle conduite tr\u00e8s importune et inacceptable.\nLe vendredi 17 juillet, vous avez dit que vous viendriez me voir durant le week-end. Je ne suis pas certaine des raisons pour lesquelles vous sembliez croire que vous me verriez. En fait, compte tenu de la fa\u00e7on dont vous avez formul\u00e9 le commentaire, je ne suis pas certaine si vous aviez l\u2019intention de me voir \u00e0 la section locale ou si vous envisagiez de venir \u00e0 mon appartement. Comme je n\u2019avais jamais eu l\u2019intention de vous voir ce week-end, je ne sais pas d\u2019o\u00f9 vous teniez cette id\u00e9e. Cela pourrait \u00eatre per\u00e7u comme une forme de harc\u00e8lement criminel. Votre comportement compromet ma s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et met la victime (moi) dans tous ses \u00e9tats. En outre, cela m\u2019incite \u00e0 croire que vous cherchez \u00e0 vous retrouver seul avec moi.\nLe lundi 20 juillet, vous m\u2019avez t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 et m\u2019avez dit que vous vouliez savoir si j\u2019avais eu un bon week-end. J\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 que vous ne t\u00e9l\u00e9phonez pas \u00e0 Jim, \u00e0 Dave ou \u00e0 Ken. Est\u2011ce l\u00e0 votre fa\u00e7on de m\u2019isoler afin que vous puissiez me parler tous les jours?\nVous devez cesser de vous comporter de cette fa\u00e7on, sans quoi je prendrai d\u2019autres mesures. Je pourrais m\u00eame d\u00e9poser des accusations en bonne et due forme dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure disciplinaire et exposer ainsi au grand jour vos faits et gestes.\nSinc\u00e8rement,\n[signature] Connie Bushey Pr\u00e9sidente, Section locale 70180, SEPC\nLa plaignante a transmis des copies de la lettre \u00e0 MM. Murray, Matchett, Vaughan et Fraser. \u00c0 la demande de la plaignante, MM. Vaughan et Fraser ont rencontr\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour lui donner la lettre en mains propres. Bien qu\u2019il ait lu la lettre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 de la garder et l\u2019a remise. MM. Vaughan et Fraser lui ont dit de cesser d\u2019importuner la plaignante, ce \u00e0 quoi il a apparemment acquiescer.\n[71] Plus tard ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait parvenir \u00e0 M. Murray la lettre manuscrite suivante (texte original int\u00e9gral) :\n[TRADUCTION]\nCher confr\u00e8re Jim Murray,\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 notre conversation de cet apr\u00e8s-midi, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que la lettre fournie par M. Jim Fraser et M. Dave Vaughan est fausse et inexacte. Je n\u2019ai rien fait de mal. Je ne t\u00e9l\u00e9phonerai pas \u00e0 Connie au travail; j\u2019appellerai plut\u00f4t au bureau de la section locale pour les affaires syndicales.\nJe suis une personne honn\u00eate qui travaille fort et qui aide volontiers les autres. Je puis dire beaucoup de choses au sujet de quelqu\u2019un, mais \u00e7a ne veut pas dire qu\u2019elles sont justes.\nAfin de r\u00e9soudre la m\u00e9sentente interne, je veux vous rencontrer avec Connie et Tom Matchett. Je travaille jusqu\u2019\u00e0 15 h 30. Veuillez m\u2019indiquer quand nous pouvons nous rencontrer. Je ne d\u00e9missionnerai pas. Je veux tourner la page.\nPlus tard cette semaine\u2011l\u00e0, la plaignante a rencontr\u00e9 un responsable de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada. Cette personne l\u2019a inform\u00e9e que le comportement de l\u2019intim\u00e9, tel que d\u00e9crit par elle, pourrait constituer une forme de harc\u00e8lement criminel. Il l\u2019a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9e qu\u2019elle pourrait porter plainte aupr\u00e8s de son employeur, du syndicat, de la police et de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Toutefois, ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de la demande de r\u00e9union de l\u2019intim\u00e9, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019attendre avant de porter plainte.\n(xiii) Rencontre du 27 juillet 1998 [72] Tel que demand\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans sa lettre du 20 juillet, une r\u00e9union s\u2019est tenue au bureau de la section locale le 27 juillet 1998. Y ont particip\u00e9 MM. Murray, Matchett, Vaughan et Fraser, ainsi que l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la plaignante. La rencontre \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. Matchett. Selon la plaignante, il \u00e9tait bien \u00e9vident que la r\u00e9union, aux yeux des autres repr\u00e9sentants du syndicat, avait pour objet de r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me en vue de la bonne marche des activit\u00e9s de la section locale. Le groupe n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vraiment int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9gler la question du comportement de l\u2019intim\u00e9. La plaignante a fait remarquer que la p\u00e9riode des n\u00e9gociations collectives approchait \u00e0 grands pas et que le SCEP ne pouvait se permettre qu\u2019il subsiste des tensions au sein de sa plus grande section locale.\n[73] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que lorsqu\u2019elle a racont\u00e9 aux autres les incidents qui s\u2019\u00e9taient produits, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas cess\u00e9 de poser des objections et de crier que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vrai et qu\u2019elle mentait. Lorsqu\u2019il a ni\u00e9 avoir sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que la section locale lui ach\u00e8te des fleurs et une robe, M. Fraser est intervenu et a dit \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] : Oui, vous l\u2019avez fait. Cessez de mentir. Bien qu\u2019il ait d\u2019abord ni\u00e9 les accusations de la plaignante au sujet de ses sollicitations r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es de relations sexuelles, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a finalement admis : [TRADUCTION] Je n\u2019ai pas demand\u00e9 trois fois de faire l\u2019amour avec toi, mais seulement une fois et j\u2019\u00e9tais ivre.\n[74] En fin de compte, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9missionne du comit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, qu\u2019il s\u2019engage \u00e0 venir au bureau de la section locale seulement le mercredi et qu\u2019il cesse de communiquer avec la plaignante. Les autres participants ont peut-\u00eatre eu l\u2019impression qu\u2019il existait un consensus en faveur de l\u2019acceptation de cette proposition pour r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me, mais la plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019accord. Elle a fait remarquer que M. Matchett a clos la r\u00e9union en disant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait simplement continuer de faire son travail et qu\u2019il lui a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 elle instruction de cesser de lui \u00e9crire des lettres. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle a per\u00e7u la proposition comme une approbation implicite du harc\u00e8lement criminel et des sollicitations sexuelles de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit.\n[75] D\u00e9\u00e7ue du r\u00e9sultat de la r\u00e9union, la plaignante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prendre des mesures contre l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le 31 juillet 1998, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la section des droits de la personne de Postes Canada. Le 4 ao\u00fbt 1998, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre l\u2019intim\u00e9, des accusations aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019AFPC et du SEPC, conform\u00e9ment aux Statuts de l\u2019AFPC et aux R\u00e8glements du SEPC. Elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait eu une conduite pr\u00e9judiciable au bon ordre et \u00e0 la discipline au sein du syndicat et qu\u2019il l\u2019avait sexuellement ou personnellement harcel\u00e9e.\n[76] Le 10 ao\u00fbt 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Murray pour l\u2019informer de sa d\u00e9mission \u00e0 titre de tr\u00e9sorier de la section locale, \u00e0 compter de ce jour\u2011l\u00e0.\n[77] Le 31 ao\u00fbt 1998, M. Fraser et la plaignante ont rencontr\u00e9 un enqu\u00eateur de la Police r\u00e9gionale d\u2019Ottawa\u2011Carleton. Un dossier a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert au nom de la plaignante au sujet de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que, si jamais elle estimait avoir besoin d\u2019aide, la police connaisse d\u00e9j\u00e0 les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de l\u2019affaire. Pour plus de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, la plaignante a communiqu\u00e9 le num\u00e9ro de dossier de la police \u00e0 son chef, M. S\u00e9guin.\n[78] Le 30 octobre 1998, Postes Canada a communiqu\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats de son enqu\u00eate sur la plainte interne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante aupr\u00e8s de la section des droits de la personne. L\u2019enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e par Mme Leslie Hine, coordonnatrice des droits de la personne \u00e0 Postes Canada, qui a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle avait interrog\u00e9 de nombreux t\u00e9moins dans le cadre d\u2019entrevues personnelles, dont la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ni l\u2019intim\u00e9 ni la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents lors des entrevues avec les autres t\u00e9moins. Au cours de ces rencontres, Mme Hine a pris des notes. Dans la plupart des cas, les notes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 montr\u00e9es aux t\u00e9moins et sign\u00e9es par eux. Postes Canada a conclu que le comportement obsessionnel de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et ses sollicitations sexuelles importunes \u00e9taient inacceptables et que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne pouvait fermer les yeux sur ce genre de choses. L\u2019employeur a donc ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de suivre un cours de sensibilisation aux droits de la personne, de pr\u00e9senter des excuses sinc\u00e8res \u00e0 la plaignante et de s\u2019abstenir compl\u00e8tement de communiquer avec elle. En outre, il l\u2019a suspendu sans solde pendant deux semaines et a vers\u00e9 \u00e0 son dossier personnel une copie de la lettre \u00e9non\u00e7ant ces conclusions. Tout manquement aux conditions impos\u00e9es entra\u00eenerait son cong\u00e9diement imm\u00e9diat. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief au sujet de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur, mais il l\u2019a ult\u00e9rieurement retir\u00e9.\n[79] Toujours le 30 octobre 1998, l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif national du SEPC a mis la section locale sous tutelle en raison de [TRADUCTION] s\u00e9rieux doutes quant \u00e0 sa [TRADUCTION] capacit\u00e9 de fonctionner. La plaignante et les autres membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient plus en poste. Lorsque la section locale a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre sous tutelle un an plus tard, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9\u00e9lue pr\u00e9sidente.\n[80] Le comit\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par le syndicat pour enqu\u00eater sur les accusations de la plaignante contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 a conclu qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e sexuellement et personnellement. L\u2019ex\u00e9cutif national du SEPC a adopt\u00e9 le rapport du comit\u00e9 et, le 1er juin 1999, le Conseil national d\u2019administration de l\u2019AFPC a suspendu l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans, le privant ainsi de son titre de membre du syndicat.\n[81] Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1998, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission. Des plaintes distinctes ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission contre l\u2019AFPC et le SEPC; dans ces plaintes, la plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que ces organisations syndicales ne lui avaient pas offert un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement. Ces derni\u00e8res plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es quelques semaines avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(xiv) Mesures prises par la plaignante pour \u00e9viter tout contact avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 [82] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019une des principales craintes que lui inspirait la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait que celui\u2011ci se pr\u00e9senterait \u00e0 son appartement suite au d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de ce dernier \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de l\u2019endroit ou elle r\u00e9sidait. Elle all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle avait fait part au g\u00e9rant et aux surintendants de l\u2019immeuble des inqui\u00e9tudes que lui causait l\u2019intim\u00e9. Fait plus important, m\u00eame si elle aimait l\u2019appartement qu\u2019elle occupait depuis son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Ottawa onze ans auparavant, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9m\u00e9nager le plus loin possible de la ville, afin qu\u2019il soit difficile \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de lui rendre visite. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher un nouveau logement en d\u00e9cembre 1998. En juin 1999, elle a emm\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans une maison qu\u2019elle avait achet\u00e9e bien en\u2011dehors de la ville. Elle continue de travailler \u00e0 Postes Canada et il lui faut maintenant une heure et demie pour se rendre \u00e0 son travail. Elle doit utiliser sa voiture, alors qu\u2019auparavant il lui \u00e9tait facile de marcher depuis son appartement. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas faire installer le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone dans sa maison et de n\u2019utiliser qu\u2019un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire dont le num\u00e9ro ne figure dans un aucun annuaire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\n[83] Depuis ce temps, la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont tous deux emm\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans un nouveau bureau et dans un nouvel immeuble au sein du complexe de Postes Canada. N\u00e9anmoins, l\u2019employeur a mis en place des mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciales. Le nom de la plaignante n\u2019est affich\u00e9 nulle part. Il ne figure ni \u00e0 la porte de son bureau ni dans aucun r\u00e9pertoire d\u2019employ\u00e9s. Son bureau est toujours situ\u00e9 dans une aire centrale et publique, loin des coins et des cages d\u2019escalier. Il est interdit \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de mettre les pieds dans l\u2019immeuble o\u00f9 travaille la plaignante.\n[84] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a reconnu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne lui a pas parl\u00e9 et n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec elle depuis 1998. Lors d\u2019une rencontre forfaite dans un magasin il y a un an, il a tourn\u00e9 les talons et s\u2019est \u00e9loign\u00e9 d\u2019elle. La plaignante soutient que le changement de comportement chez l\u2019intim\u00e9 est attribuable \u00e0 sa crainte de perdre son emploi s\u2019il contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Postes Canada de ne jamais entrer en contact avec elle.\nB. Le point de vue de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [85] L\u2019intim\u00e9 rejette la pr\u00e9tention de la plaignante voulant qu\u2019il se soit joint \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale afin de pouvoir \u00eatre en sa compagnie. Il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il a remarqu\u00e9 lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union syndicale tenue en septembre 1997 que les groupes minoritaires visibles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au sein de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale et qu\u2019il a pens\u00e9 qu\u2019il donnerait l\u2019exemple en s\u2019impliquant. En outre, il a vu cela comme une occasion d\u2019am\u00e9liorer sa connaissance de la langue anglaise et de rencontrer des employ\u00e9s d\u2019autres services. Enfin, il a dit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9ablement surpris d\u2019apprendre que les membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale recevaient une modeste r\u00e9tribution.\n[86] L\u2019intim\u00e9 admet avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et lui avoir rendu visite \u00e0 l\u2019occasion. Cependant, il soutient que leurs conversations avaient toujours trait aux activit\u00e9s syndicales. Par exemple, il venait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 son bureau pour lui faire signer les ch\u00e8ques de paye ou de remboursement de d\u00e9penses de M. Fraser. L\u2019intim\u00e9 apportait les ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 la conjointe de M. Fraser, qui travaillait dans un immeuble voisin. Quatre ou cinq des quinze \u00e0 vingt ch\u00e8ques \u00e9tablis chaque mois \u00e9taient faits \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de M. Fraser. L\u2019intim\u00e9 nie cat\u00e9goriquement que ses appels et visites \u00e9taient aussi fr\u00e9quentes que la plaignante le pr\u00e9tend. Il soutient qu\u2019il lui rendait visite trois ou quatre fois par semaine tout au plus et que ces visites avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante. En outre, il a dit qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu souvent au bureau de la section locale apr\u00e8s le travail parce que de nombreux livres et autres documents de la section locale n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en ordre et qu\u2019il lui avait fallu un certain temps pour corriger la situation.\n[87] L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne que ses fonctions ne lui permettaient pas de s\u2019absenter de son bureau aussi souvent que l\u2019a pr\u00e9tendu la plaignante dans son t\u00e9moignage. Durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente, il supervisait deux autres employ\u00e9s qui lui demandaient conseil. Il devait \u00eatre \u00e0 leur disposition en tout temps. Son superviseur de l\u2019\u00e9poque, M. Chiumera, a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas constat\u00e9 d\u2019absences anormales. Cependant, en contre-interrogatoire, M. Chiumera a reconnu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais surveill\u00e9 les pauses ordinaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et que si ce dernier s\u2019\u00e9tait absent\u00e9 de son bureau, ne serait\u2011ce que pendant dix minutes, il ne l\u2019aurait pas remarqu\u00e9. M. Chiumera a admis qu\u2019il suffisait de deux ou trois minutes pour se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage de la plaignante en prenant l\u2019ascenseur. Mme Hine a interrog\u00e9 M. Chiumera le 31 ao\u00fbt 1998 dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par la section des droits de la personne de Postes Canada. Selon ses notes, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 lues et sign\u00e9es par M. Chiumera \u00e0 la fin de la rencontre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019absentait de son poste de travail ou \u00e9tait au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone plus souvent depuis qu\u2019il faisait partie de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif du syndicat, mais la dur\u00e9e de ses absences et appels ne d\u00e9passait pas celle de ses pauses normales.\n[88] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 maintient cat\u00e9goriquement qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de discussions de nature sexuelle entre la plaignante et lui. Ils ont eu des conversations amicales au sujet de certains aspects de leur vie personnelle, notamment \u00e0 propos de son mariage organis\u00e9. Elle lui a elle aussi fait part de certains d\u00e9tails concernant sa famille. Cependant, il nie fermement s\u2019\u00eatre extasi\u00e9 sur sa beaut\u00e9, lui avoir racont\u00e9 ses fantasmes sexuels ou propos\u00e9 de faire l\u2019amour ou quelque chose du genre. Il qualifie ses rapports avec la plaignante [TRADUCTION] d\u2019amicaux et qu\u2019il la consid\u00e9rait [TRADUCTION] comme une s\u0153ur.\n[89] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les seuls articles d\u2019ameublement dont il a propos\u00e9 l\u2019achat au bureau de la section locale \u00e9taient des chaises, des classeurs et un pupitre. Il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis, en outre, que le r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur devrait \u00eatre remplac\u00e9. Cependant, il maintient qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais propos\u00e9 l\u2019achat d\u2019un nouveau canap\u00e9. Il pr\u00e9tend que la plaignante, M. Fraser et M. Vaughan \u00e9taient [TRADUCTION] contre lui et [TRADUCTION] mentaient lorsqu\u2019ils ont affirm\u00e9 le contraire dans leur t\u00e9moignage.\n[90] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a ni\u00e9 avoir jamais propos\u00e9 que la section locale organise une f\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la plaignante ou qu\u2019elle lui ach\u00e8te une robe et des fleurs. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait remarquer que l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re dans le restaurant o\u00f9 il avait, semble\u2011t\u2011il, sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que la section locale ach\u00e8te \u00e0 la plaignante une robe et organise pour elle une f\u00eate \u00e9tait tellement bruyante que MM. Hudon, Vaughan et Fraser n\u2019auraient pu entendre le soi-disant commentaire. Il a fait observer que ces t\u00e9moins avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de se souvenir de nombreux autres d\u00e9tails concernant cette sortie. En ce qui touche les fleurs qu\u2019il avait en main lors de la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie de remise des dipl\u00f4mes, l\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e9gue que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas lui qui les avait achet\u00e9es mais plut\u00f4t la section locale et que c\u2019est M. Fraser qui les avait amen\u00e9es \u00e0 la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, M. Fraser les a donn\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Zarichansky, qui les a remises par la suite \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[91] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a ni\u00e9 ni comment\u00e9 en aucune fa\u00e7on les remarques qu\u2019il a, semble\u2011t\u2011il, faites \u00e0 la plaignante dans sa voiture lorsqu\u2019il l\u2019a ramen\u00e9e chez elle le 10 mars 1998 et, fait plus important, il n\u2019a ni\u00e9 ni comment\u00e9 en aucune fa\u00e7on l\u2019incident survenu au bureau de la section locale le 18 avril 1998 et au cours duquel il y aurait eu, selon la plaignante, contact physique.\n[92] L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet avoir rencontr\u00e9 le 21 avril 1998 MM. Vaughan et Fraser et que ceux\u2011ci lui ont alors pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la lettre du 19 avril de la plaignante et lui ont dit de ne plus aller \u00e0 son bureau. Leurs commentaires l\u2019ont mis en col\u00e8re et il a ni\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations concernant sa conduite. Il a dit \u00eatre contrari\u00e9 par le fait que cette question n\u2019ait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e avec lui auparavant. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que MM. Vaughan et Fraser lui avaient dit de venir au bureau de la section locale plus tard cet apr\u00e8s-midi\u2011l\u00e0 pour r\u00e9diger une lettre d\u2019excuses \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la plaignante et que l\u2019incident serait clos. Ils mena\u00e7aient de rendre publiques les all\u00e9gations en cas de refus d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 leur demande. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a obtemp\u00e9r\u00e9 et s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au bureau de la section locale, mais il nie avoir r\u00e9dig\u00e9 la lettre. Il pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il a simplement dactylographi\u00e9 la lettre que lui avait dict\u00e9e M. Vaughan. Une fois la lettre imprim\u00e9e et sign\u00e9e par lui, il l\u2019a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Vaughan pour qu\u2019il la remette \u00e0 la plaignante. MM. Fraser et Vaughan, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s comme t\u00e9moin par la Commission, ont tous deux affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de la lettre d\u2019excuses de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas aid\u00e9 celui\u2011ci \u00e0 la r\u00e9diger.\n[93] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante chez elle plus tard ce soir\u2011l\u00e0 (21 avril) pour l\u2019inviter \u00e0 la r\u00e9union des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s syndicaux. Cependant, il admet lui avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au travail trois jours plus tard pour lui parler de la lettre qu\u2019il lui avait fait parvenir. Elle l\u2019a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 venir la voir \u00e0 son bureau pour discuter de la question. \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e, il a remarqu\u00e9 que la lettre d\u2019excuses \u00e9tait sur son pupitre. Elle lui a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas respectueux \u00e0 son endroit et qu\u2019il devrait s\u2019excuser. Il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fourni des excuses, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 faire plus. Afin de lui prouver qu\u2019il la respectait, qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mauvais et qu\u2019il ne voulait pas lui faire de mal, il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le message sur l\u2019autocollant Post\u2011It dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieurement et a appos\u00e9 celui\u2011ci sur sa lettre d\u2019excuses. Elle a jet\u00e9 les deux documents \u00e0 la poubelle et lui a dit de retourner travailler.\n[94] Au cours des jours et semaines qui ont suivi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a, selon ses dires, crois\u00e9 la plaignante au bureau de la section locale. Il se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s des plaisanteries, se sont demand\u00e9s mutuellement comment ils allaient et comment allaient leurs familles, comment leurs week-ends s\u2019\u00e9taient d\u00e9roul\u00e9s, et ainsi de suite. \u00c0 part ces conversations, il s\u2019en est tenu \u00e0 des questions syndicales comme l\u2019approbation de sa participation \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence du SEPC \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Ses rapports avec elle \u00e9taient de nature professionnelle.\n[95] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019au cours de cette conf\u00e9rence, tenue en mai 1998, aucun des autres repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux pr\u00e9sents, notamment MM. Hudon, Matchett et Murray, ne s\u2019est plaint \u00e0 lui de son comportement envers la plaignante. Cependant, il a admis ne jamais leur avoir demand\u00e9 leur opinion \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[96] L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9cision de sa famille de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec sa soi-disant tentative pour se rapprocher du lieu de r\u00e9sidence de la plaignante. L\u2019intim\u00e9, sa femme et ses enfants habitaient dans une r\u00e9sidence unifamiliale au centre-ville d\u2019Ottawa. Il n\u2019y avait pas de cour arri\u00e8re o\u00f9 les enfants pouvaient jouer et la famille \u00e9tait relativement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9troit. Le p\u00e8re de l\u2019intim\u00e9 poss\u00e8de plusieurs immeubles r\u00e9sidentiels dans la ville, dont celui o\u00f9 ils habitaient et celui o\u00f9 ils ont emm\u00e9nag\u00e9. Ce dernier logement est une r\u00e9sidence unifamiliale dot\u00e9e d\u2019une cour arri\u00e8re qui est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 quelques minutes du lieu de travail de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e par le p\u00e8re de l\u2019intim\u00e9 il y a pr\u00e8s d\u2019une vingtaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es. Les locataires ant\u00e9rieurs ayant tard\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter la maison, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pu y emm\u00e9nager qu\u2019en juillet 1998.\n[97] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, plusieurs incidents permettent de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas harcel\u00e9 la plaignante et qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment interagi avec lui. Il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 son aide au d\u00e9but d\u2019avril 1998 pour qu\u2019il l\u2019initie au logiciel de pr\u00e9paration de d\u00e9claration de revenus appel\u00e9 QuickTax. M. Hudon et lui avaient distribu\u00e9 des exemplaires du logiciel aux membres du syndicat afin de les aider \u00e0 \u00e9tablir leur d\u00e9claration de revenus. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 dit se souvenir que la plaignante avait demand\u00e9 son aide dans le cas o\u00f9 elle se porterait candidate au poste de pr\u00e9sident national du SEPC et qu\u2019elle avait promis d\u2019appuyer sa candidature au poste de pr\u00e9sident de la section locale. Selon ses all\u00e9gations, la plaignante lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour lui demander d\u2019envoyer par courrier \u00e9lectronique le jeu-questionnaire, ce qu\u2019il a fait le 12 juin.\n[98] En mai ou juin 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 et sa famille sont rest\u00e9s pris dans un ascenseur de l\u2019immeuble du CTC dans lequel se trouvait le bureau de la section locale. Il a fallu l\u2019aide du service d\u2019incendie pour les sortir de ce mauvais pas. Lorsque la plaignante a entendu parler de l\u2019incident, elle a invit\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 son bureau pour discuter de la chose et des mesures \u00e0 prendre. \u00c0 une autre occasion (toujours en mai ou juin 1998), l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif \u00e9tait r\u00e9uni dans un restaurant. L\u2019intim\u00e9 se souvient que M. Fraser avait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il faisait bon de voir que la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 avaient mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 leurs diff\u00e9rends et avaient \u00e0 nouveau des relations amicales. La plaignante n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9, semble\u2011t\u2011il, de le contredire. Au dire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, jumel\u00e9s au fait que la plaignante n\u2019a port\u00e9 plainte \u00e0 aucune autorit\u00e9 entre f\u00e9vrier et juillet 1998, d\u00e9montrent que leurs rapports \u00e9taient amicaux et qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas harcel\u00e9e.\n[99] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est f\u00e2ch\u00e9 lorsque MM Vaughan et Fraser lui ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la lettre de la plaignante en date du 20 juillet 1998. Il \u00e9tait en d\u00e9saccord avec le contenu de la lettre, bien qu\u2019il n\u2019en ait lu qu\u2019une partie avant de la rejeter. \u00c0 son avis, c\u2019est lui qui faisait l\u2019objet de harc\u00e8lement de la part de la plaignante. Il aurait clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 aux deux autres qu\u2019il ne signerait aucune nouvelle lettre d\u2019excuses. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a offert de d\u00e9missionner de son poste au sein de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif, mais MM. Vaughan et Fraser lui ont \u00e0 nouveau conseill\u00e9 de ne pas le faire. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a ensuite communiqu\u00e9 avec MM. Matchett et Murray pour leur demander de convoquer une r\u00e9union pour r\u00e9gler la question [TRADUCTION] une fois pour toutes.\n[100] Cette r\u00e9union a eu lieu le 27 juillet. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, une entente est intervenue. Il souligne que bien que la suggestion initiale de M. Fraser \u00e9tait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne se rende au bureau de la section locale que le mercredi, la plaignante est intervenue et a express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 qu\u2019on exige qu\u2019il d\u00e9missionne \u00e9galement du comit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec sa pr\u00e9tention voulant qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas accept\u00e9 la proposition pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union. Il fait observer qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite de la r\u00e9union, il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019entente intervenue en d\u00e9missionnant du comit\u00e9, en r\u00e9duisant le nombre de ses visites au bureau de la section locale et en cessant compl\u00e8tement de communiquer avec la plaignante.\n[101] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9 d\u2019apprendre que la plaignante avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre lui une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de Postes Canada et du syndicat. Il s\u2019est entretenu de la question avec son directeur et un agent des ressources humaines de Postes Canada. Apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 sa famille, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9missionner de son poste au sein de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale. Il a ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 seul sur une p\u00e9riode de plusieurs jours par Mme Hine. Alors qu\u2019il r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 ses questions, Mme Hine prenait des notes. Le 20 octobre 1998, Mme Hine l\u2019a rencontr\u00e9 et lui a demand\u00e9 de prendre connaissance de ses notes. Il a refus\u00e9 de le faire et n\u2019a pas voulu qu\u2019elle lui en remette un exemplaire, m\u00eame s\u2019il a sign\u00e9 et dat\u00e9 le document. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019objecte \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont Mme Hine a men\u00e9 son enqu\u00eate, pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas interrog\u00e9 certaines des personnes qui, lui avait\u2011il dit, \u00e9taient des t\u00e9moins importants. En outre, il en avait contre le fait qu\u2019elle ne lui ait pas permis d\u2019assister aux autres entrevues qu\u2019elle avait men\u00e9es. L\u2019intim\u00e9 nie un grand nombre des d\u00e9clarations qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es selon les notes prises par Mme Hine lors de l\u2019entrevue.\n[102] Vers la fin d\u2019octobre 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de Postes Canada concernant la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne au cours d\u2019une rencontre avec Mme Hine, \u00e0 laquelle ont \u00e9galement assist\u00e9 son directeur et un repr\u00e9sentant du SEPC. Il \u00e9tait en d\u00e9saccord avec les conclusions de Postes Canada et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief auquel il a ult\u00e9rieurement renonc\u00e9. Selon ses all\u00e9gations, il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les recommandations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision. \u00c0 cause du stress auquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en proie par suite des diverses plaintes port\u00e9es contre lui, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend avoir plusieurs probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux, mais aucune preuve d\u2019experts n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa pr\u00e9tention.\n[103] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulign\u00e9 tout au cours de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il est une personne qui a une bonne r\u00e9putation \u00e0 Postes Canada et dans la collectivit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il est un employ\u00e9 travailleur qui prolonge r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ses heures de travail pour venir \u00e0 bout de ses t\u00e2ches. Il a servi le syndicat et ses membres, notamment en si\u00e9geant au comit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, en \u00e9laborant et en fournissant un logiciel aux membres du syndicat en vue de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de leur d\u00e9claration de revenus, en faisant des d\u00e9marches en vue de la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un site Web pour la section locale et en administrant bien les fonds de la section locale. Il a supervis\u00e9 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s et c\u00f4toy\u00e9 des douzaines de coll\u00e8gues travaillant au m\u00eame endroit que lui. Il a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 des endroits o\u00f9 50 \u00e0 80 % de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre est de sexe f\u00e9minin. Cependant, personne d\u2019autre que la plaignante ne l\u2019a jamais accus\u00e9 de harc\u00e8lement sexuel ou d\u2019autres m\u00e9faits. Selon lui, c\u2019est la preuve qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas harcel\u00e9 sexuellement la plaignante.\nII. Le droit [104] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne[1] (la Loi), le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite (par. 14(2)).\n[105] Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Inc.[2], le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail peut \u00eatre d\u00e9fini de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour la victime. Le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail est une atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la victime et \u00e0 son respect de soi \u00e0 la fois comme employ\u00e9 et comme \u00eatre humain.\n[106] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (CDP) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) et Franke[3], la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 cette d\u00e9finition. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que pour qu\u2019une plainte de harc\u00e8lement soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, il faut que soient r\u00e9unies les conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci\u2011apr\u00e8s :\nLa conduite reproch\u00e9e doit \u00eatre de nature sexuelle. Les demandes de faveurs et les sollicitations sont de nature sexuelle et constituent une forme psychologique de harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Le harc\u00e8lement peut \u00e9galement se manifester sur le plan physique (p. ex., pincements, \u00e9treintes, caresses, baisers, regards concupiscents). Il peut \u00e9galement prendre la forme d'un comportement verbal (p. ex., insultes d\u2019ordre sexuel, remarques sexistes concernant l\u2019apparence d\u2019une personne ou ses habitudes sexuelles). Pour d\u00e9terminer les comportements de nature sexuelle, le tribunal se fonde sur le crit\u00e8re de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances, compte tenu des normes sociales existantes. Les comportements faisant l\u2019objet de la plainte \u00e9taient importuns. Autrement dit, il faut d\u00e9terminer si la conduite du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harceleur \u00e9tait d\u00e9sir\u00e9e ou sollicit\u00e9e. Pour ce faire, on peut tenir compte de la r\u00e9action de la partie plaignante au moment o\u00f9 sont survenus les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de harc\u00e8lement et d\u00e9terminer si celle\u2011ci a express\u00e9ment exprim\u00e9 ou d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par son comportement que la conduite \u00e9tait importune. Cependant, la Cour a reconnu qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si un refus verbal a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9 dans tous les cas et que le fait d\u2019omettre \u00e0 maintes reprises de r\u00e9pondre aux commentaires suggestifs peut \u00eatre une indication au pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harceleur que sa conduite \u00e9tait importune. En pareil cas, la norme \u00e0 appliquer en vue d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la conduite reproch\u00e9e est celle de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il faut, pour qu\u2019il y ait harc\u00e8lement, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition. Cependant, dans certaines circonstances (p. ex., agression physique) un seul incident peut suffire \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile. On se fonde une fois de plus sur le crit\u00e8re objectif de la personne raisonnable pour \u00e9valuer cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment. Le dernier \u00e9l\u00e9ment doit \u00eatre pris en compte lorsqu\u2019une plainte concernant la conduite d\u2019un employ\u00e9 est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre un employeur. L\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige que l\u2019employ\u00e9 avise, \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion, l\u2019employeur de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite offensante. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u2019est pas pertinent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Tribunal n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d\u2019aucune plainte en ce qui touche la conduite de l\u2019employeur.\n[107] Dans Stadnyk c. Canada (Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 que dans les cas o\u00f9 il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert qui confirme que l\u2019interaction homme-femme pourrait \u00eatre per\u00e7ue diff\u00e9remment par les hommes et par les femmes, le tribunal devrait appliquer le crit\u00e8re juridique du harc\u00e8lement sexuel du point de vue de la femme raisonnable[4]. Toutefois, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, aucun t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert de ce genre n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9.\nIII. Analyse A. Question pr\u00e9liminaire \u2013 Comp\u00e9tence [108] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, on s\u2019est interrog\u00e9 quelque peu \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019objet de la plainte tombait sous le coup de la Loi et si, par extension, il \u00e9tait du ressort du Tribunal. Selon l\u2019article 2, la Loi s\u2019applique \u00e0 toutes les questions relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada. Le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur le service postal au Canada constitue l\u2019un des pouvoirs d\u00e9volus au Parlement aux termes du paragraphe 91(5) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867[5]. M\u00eame si la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 travaillent tous les deux \u00e0 Postes Canada, les rapports qu\u2019ils ont entretenus s\u2019inscrivaient dans le cadre de leur r\u00f4le respectif au sein du syndicat et non, \u00e0 proprement parler, dans le cours de l\u2019emploi.\n[109] Cependant, la preuve d\u00e9montre clairement qu\u2019un grand nombre, voire la plupart, des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s actes d\u2019inconduite sont survenus au lieu de travail, durant les heures de travail. C\u2019est le cas notamment des visites et appels r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au bureau de la plaignante. En outre, m\u00eame les actes qui sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment survenus ailleurs que dans les locaux de Postes Canada s\u2019inscrivaient dans le cadre du travail fait par les parties au nom de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation, lequel est en soi inextricablement li\u00e9 \u00e0 leur emploi. Autrement dit, la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019aurait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 en contact l\u2019un avec l\u2019autre si leur statut d\u2019employ\u00e9 de Postes Canada ne les avait pas amen\u00e9s \u00e0 s\u2019occuper d\u2019affaires syndicales. Il me semble qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas essentiel que les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte de harc\u00e8lement li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019emploi se soient produits au lieu de travail qui est soumis \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Toute conduite \u2013 peu importe o\u00f9 elle survient \u2013 qui s\u2019inscrit d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre dans le cadre d\u2019un emploi sous r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale tombe sous le coup de la Loi.\n[110] Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cluff c. Canada (minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Agriculture)[6], l\u2019expression en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi qui figure \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 de la Loi englobe les activit\u00e9s que l\u2019on peut raisonnablement et \u00e9quitablement consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des activit\u00e9s accessoires \u00e0 l\u2019emploi ou li\u00e9es \u00e0 celui\u2011ci de fa\u00e7on logique et naturelle. \u00c0 mon avis, les activit\u00e9s des parties au sein de la section locale r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 cette d\u00e9finition et, de ce fait, l\u2019objet de la plainte tombe sous le coup de l\u2019article 14. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 trancher les questions soulev\u00e9es.\nB. Cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la preuve [111] Je dois affirmer d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part que je privil\u00e9gie, presque sur tous les points, la version des faits fournie par la plaignante par rapport \u00e0 celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 exhaustif, d\u00e9taill\u00e9, limpide et cr\u00e9dible. En revanche, les d\u00e9n\u00e9gations et all\u00e9gations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de l\u2019intim\u00e9 voulant que la plaignante et tous les autres t\u00e9moins aient fabriqu\u00e9 une grande partie des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne sont tout simplement pas cr\u00e9dibles.\n[112] La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve des notes d\u00e9taill\u00e9es d\u00e9crivant la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9, notes qu\u2019elle a consign\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 sont survenus les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s actes. Ces notes sont conformes \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage et \u00e0 celui des autres t\u00e9moins. La plupart des t\u00e9moins qui connaissent la plaignante ont confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point elle est m\u00e9ticuleuse et organis\u00e9e, tant dans son travail que dans ses activit\u00e9s syndicales. Le fait qu\u2019elle ait recueilli et tenu \u00e0 jour ces renseignements et la fa\u00e7on dont ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s cadre bien avec cette description de sa personnalit\u00e9.\n[113] Plusieurs des t\u00e9moins qui ont comparu \u00e0 l\u2019audience (MM. Vaughan, Hudon, S\u00e9guin, Chiumera, Fraser, Murray et Matchett) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9s par Mme Hine. Fait int\u00e9ressant, le t\u00e9moignage de ces t\u00e9moins a \u00e9t\u00e9 presque en tout point conforme aux d\u00e9clarations consign\u00e9es par Mme Hine au cours des entrevues faites entre ao\u00fbt et octobre 1998, peu apr\u00e8s que le comportement reproch\u00e9 soit survenu.\n[114] Mme Hine a elle-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e \u00e0 compara\u00eetre par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Elle a donn\u00e9 aux personnes interrog\u00e9es amplement l\u2019occasion de revoir et de faire corriger ses notes, et plusieurs t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audience ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient effectivement fait modifier certains passages du texte apr\u00e8s en avoir pris connaissance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. De plus, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 par le fait que Mme Hine se souvenait d\u2019un grand nombre des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es lors de ces entrevues, ainsi que par le soin avec lequel elle a indiqu\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal les passages de ses notes dont elle ne se souvenait pas de m\u00e9moire. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu que les notes de Mme Hine sont le reflet fid\u00e8le de ses conversations avec les personnes qu\u2019elle a interrog\u00e9es.\n[115] Mme Hine a interrog\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ses notes indiquent qu\u2019il a admis certains faits substantiels qu\u2019on lui reprochait. Par exemple, selon les notes, il a reconnu avoir parl\u00e9 de sexe avec la plaignante. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 une occasion, soit la fois o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] ivre, [il] a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 plus hardi que d\u2019habitude avec la plaignante. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a ni\u00e9 avoir fait ces commentaires durant l\u2019entrevue.\n[116] Contrairement \u00e0 la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est souvent montr\u00e9 vague lors de son t\u00e9moignage et, fait particuli\u00e8rement remarquable, n\u2019a pas du tout r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 certaines all\u00e9gations importantes faites contre lui. Par exemple, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas comment\u00e9 ni contredit les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante concernant l\u2019incident survenu le 10 mars dans sa voiture ainsi que les all\u00e9gations concernant l\u2019incident qui s\u2019est produit le 18 avril au bureau de la section locale. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9taient accessoires par rapport aux aspects essentiels de la plainte, et son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019a pas contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9branler la preuve de la plaignante.\n[117] L\u2019angle sous lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019aborder la question de la lettre d\u2019excuses du 22 avril illustre ce point. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulign\u00e9 plusieurs fois au cours de son t\u00e9moignage que c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Vaughan qui avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le texte. Je ne trouve pas la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9 convaincante. MM. Vaughan et Fraser, qui ont \u00e0 mon avis pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage cr\u00e9dible dans l\u2019ensemble, ont tous deux ni\u00e9 avoir aid\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Fait plus important, l\u2019utilisation dans la lettre de l\u2019expression time to time indique que c\u2019est l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 la lettre. L\u2019avocat de la Commission a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a souvent utilis\u00e9 cette expression de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire sans la faire pr\u00e9c\u00e9der de la pr\u00e9position from, comme le veut l\u2019usage) au cours de l\u2019audience. Le superviseur de l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Eloise, a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019anglais n\u2019est pas la premi\u00e8re langue de l\u2019intim\u00e9, dont certaines aptitudes linguistiques laissent \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. En fait, c\u2019est la raison pour laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue avoir demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aide pour r\u00e9diger la lettre. Toutefois, la question \u00e0 savoir si M. Vaughan a aid\u00e9 ou non l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas vraiment \u00e0 voir avec celle qui consiste de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il a commis les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s actes discriminatoires. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a sembl\u00e9 vouloir insinuer que la lettre d\u2019excuses ne pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un aveu de culpabilit\u00e9 s\u2019il n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas l\u2019auteur. Cependant, peu importe qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 la lettre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a sign\u00e9e et a affirm\u00e9, en fait, lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019accord avec son contenu.\n[118] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a envoy\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, par courrier \u00e9lectronique dans la matin\u00e9e du 21 avril, un message d\u2019excuses distinct dont il reconna\u00eet \u00eatre l\u2019auteur. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans aucun de ces deux documents de quoi il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9sol\u00e9, et la preuve indique qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait bien acquitt\u00e9 de ses fonctions de tr\u00e9sorier jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. La plaignante soutient que, par cons\u00e9quent, les excuses avaient forc\u00e9ment trait \u00e0 ses actes de harc\u00e8lement, notamment \u00e0 l\u2019incident survenu le 18 avril au bureau de la section locale. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a fourni aucune autre explication au sujet de la b\u00e9vue qu\u2019il aurait pu commettre. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9tention de la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[119] Le fait que la plaignante ait exp\u00e9di\u00e9 le 23 octobre 1998 \u00e0 d\u2019autres sections locales du SEPC un document dans lequel elle se plaignait de la conduite de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif du Syndicat, notamment de sa r\u00e9action \u00e0 ses plaintes contre l\u2019intim\u00e9, est un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment accessoire qui a pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 celui\u2011ci. Dans ce document, qui comptait plusieurs pages et auquel \u00e9taient annex\u00e9es des photocopies des lettres \u00e9chang\u00e9es entre la plaignante et l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif du SEPC, il est fait mention du pr\u00e9nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9 une fois, probablement par inadvertance, puisque toutes les autres r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 lui dans le document ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9es. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience beaucoup d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e0 dire combien il \u00e9tait outr\u00e9 que son identit\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9voil\u00e9e, et ce m\u00eame si le document a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 bien apr\u00e8s les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de harc\u00e8lement et \u00e9tait, par cons\u00e9quent, peu ou pas pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte.\n[120] Je suis conscient du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat. S\u2019il est vrai qu\u2019il est important que le Tribunal donne aux parties qui ne sont pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es une certaine latitude dans la pr\u00e9sentation de leur preuve, particuli\u00e8rement lorsque la partie adverse a l\u2019avantage d\u2019\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par avocat, il reste qu\u2019elles sont soumises aux principes de preuve qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 toutes les plaintes concernant les droits de la personne. Toutes les parties, qu\u2019elles soient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ou non, si elles ont omis de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve essentiels pour \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de leurs arguments ou si elles n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e doivent en subir les cons\u00e9quences.\nC. La conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait-elle de nature sexuelle? [121] \u00c0 mon avis, la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait de nature sexuelle. Pour les motifs que je viens d\u2019exposer, j\u2019accepte dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante au sujet des propos que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a tenus le 10 mars dans l\u2019all\u00e9e menant \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9sidait, ainsi que de l\u2019incident survenu le 18 avril au bureau de la section locale. Les commentaires formul\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 lors que ces deux incidents \u00e9taient manifestement de nature sexuelle et repr\u00e9sentaient rien de moins que des sollicitations directes de relations sexuelles avec la plaignante. En outre, il y a eu contact physique lors du deuxi\u00e8me incident. Par ailleurs, les autres sollicitations au bureau de la section locale, au bureau de la plaignante ou au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone sont elles aussi manifestement de nature sexuelle. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019en n\u2019est pas tenu \u00e0 des sollicitations. Il a \u00e9galement manifest\u00e9 certains des comportements qui, selon l\u2019arr\u00eat Franke, constituent d\u2019autres formes de conduite de nature sexuelle, notamment le fait de regarder la victime fixement ou de mani\u00e8re concupiscente ainsi que ses commentaires r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s au sujet de son apparence. \u00c0 mon avis, les attentions exag\u00e9r\u00e9es de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plaignante, par exemple son d\u00e9sir que le syndicat lui ach\u00e8te des cadeaux et ses tentatives pour communiquer avec elle en dehors du lieu de travail, peuvent \u00e9galement \u00eatre raisonnablement per\u00e7ues dans les circonstances comme ayant une connotation sexuelle.\n[122] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu que la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait de nature sexuelle.\nD. La conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait-elle importune? [123] Je suis \u00e9galement persuad\u00e9 que la plaignante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 que sa conduite \u00e9tait importune. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 on ne peut plus clairement dans ses lettres des 18 avril et 20 juillet qu\u2019elle jugeait sa conduite inacceptable. Le niveau de d\u00e9tail avec lequel elle l\u2019informe du caract\u00e8re importun des actes est remarquable. Aucune personne raisonnable ne pourrait interpr\u00e9ter ses propos comme autre chose qu\u2019une r\u00e9probation claire et nette de son comportement. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 son comportement, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la premi\u00e8re lettre. Il a sembl\u00e9 donner \u00e0 entendre que sa lettre d\u2019excuses du 22 avril avait r\u00e9gl\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il estimait \u00eatre une m\u00e9sentente entre lui et la plaignante. \u00c0 son avis, il pouvait continuer de communiquer avec la plaignante aussi souvent qu\u2019auparavant. En pr\u00e9sumant qu\u2019il ait pu avoir des raisons de penser ainsi, celles\u2011ci auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre dissip\u00e9es par l\u2019appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u le 23 avril de la part de la plaignante et de MM. Vaughan et Fraser, au cours duquel on lui a donn\u00e9 instruction de cesser de communiquer avec elle. Cependant, plut\u00f4t que de modifier son comportement, il a recommenc\u00e9 au bout de quelques jours \u00e0 lui faire des visites et \u00e0 lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner.\n[124] Par ailleurs, l\u2019intim\u00e9 poss\u00e9dait les connaissances n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9terminer que sa conduite \u00e9tait importune, d\u00e8s le moment o\u00f9 il se joint \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale, en f\u00e9vrier 1998. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu au cours de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il avait suivi en septembre un cours sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel offert par l\u2019AFPC. Tous les membres du SEPC, particuli\u00e8rement les dirigeants faisant partie de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale, disposaient d\u2019une documentation concernant le harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Les Statuts de l\u2019AFPC et les R\u00e8glements du SEPC, qu\u2019on s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que les dirigeants faisant partie de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale connaissent, \u00e9noncent les politiques de ces organisations en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement sexuel. De surcro\u00eet, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a suivi en avril 1998 un cours sur le harc\u00e8lement personnel et sexuel donn\u00e9 par la section locale. Au congr\u00e8s de mai 1998 du SEPC, tenu \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et auquel l\u2019intim\u00e9 a particip\u00e9, un atelier sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. En juin 1998, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a suivi un cours sur les menaces et la sensibilisation comportementale. Compte tenu de cette formation qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ue et de l\u2019information dont il disposait, l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait raisonnablement d\u00fb comprendre que sa conduite \u00e9tait inacceptable. Eu \u00e9gard au rejet constant par la plaignante de ses avances et \u00e0 ses exhortations \u00e0 lui ficher la paix, il aurait certes d\u00fb s\u2019apercevoir que sa fa\u00e7on d\u2019agir \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e importune.\n[125] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis persuad\u00e9 que la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait importune.\nE. La conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 comportait-elle un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de gravit\u00e9 suffisant pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile? [126] \u00c0 mon avis, la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait suffisamment grave et r\u00e9p\u00e9titive pour empoisonner le milieu dans lequel se trouvait la plaignante, tant au travail qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur. J\u2019accepte son t\u00e9moignage voulant qu\u2019elle se soit sentie oblig\u00e9e de d\u00e9serter souvent son bureau et de recourir \u00e0 d\u2019autres tactiques \u00e9vasives afin de r\u00e9duire au minimum ses rapports avec l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait persist\u00e9 dans son comportement a amen\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 craindre pour son bien-\u00eatre physique. Le contact sexuel non souhait\u00e9 survenu au bureau de la section locale le 18 avril a aviv\u00e9 son inqui\u00e9tude. M\u00eame s\u2019il est vrai que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a finalement rel\u00e2ch\u00e9 son \u00e9treinte et obtemp\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 ses adjurations, sa fa\u00e7on d\u2019agir ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 a \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment grave pour cr\u00e9er un milieu hostile, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la lueur de ses rejets clairs et non \u00e9quivoques de ses avances sexuelles. Il n\u2019y a aucune fa\u00e7on pour lui de pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il y a eu m\u00e9prise de sa part.\n[127] Je suis persuad\u00e9 que n\u2019importe quelle personne raisonnable estimerait que la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un milieu hostile pour la plaignante.\n[128] Pour les motifs que je viens d\u2019\u00e9noncer, j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a sexuellement harcel\u00e9 la plaignante, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 de la Loi.\nIV. Les mesures de redressement [129] Ayant conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a sexuellement harcel\u00e9 la plaignante, je dois maintenant d\u00e9terminer les mesures de redressement qui s\u2019imposent. si tant est qu\u2019il y en ait. Les pouvoirs du Tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 53 de la Loi, qui permet d\u2019imposer des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables et \u00e0 indemniser la victime. L\u2019indemnisation vise \u00e0 remettre la victime dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019acte discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019origine l\u2019obligation de la d\u00e9dommager. Seule la partie de la perte qui est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible est recouvrable[7].\nA. D\u00e9penses li\u00e9es au d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de la plaignante [130] La plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que, par suite du comportement de l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui, craignait-elle, \u00e9tait devenu une forme de harc\u00e8lement criminel, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager et d\u2019aller r\u00e9sider bien en dehors d\u2019Ottawa. Elle esp\u00e9rait que le fait de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 un endroit \u00e9loign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne conna\u00eetrait pas l\u2019emp\u00eacherait, ou du moins le dissuaderait, de communiquer avec elle ailleurs qu\u2019au travail. Sa d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e en grande partie par le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de l\u2019appartement o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9sidait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Elle demande donc d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e des frais qu\u2019elle a engag\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de son d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement ainsi que des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires de d\u00e9placement d\u00e9coulant de son \u00e9loignement d\u2019Ottawa. La plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait satisfaite de l\u2019appartement o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9sidait et particuli\u00e8rement du fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 \u00e0 un endroit central, ce qui lui permettait de marcher jusqu\u2019au travail. Avant que survienne les incidents de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, elle n\u2019avait pas song\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager.\n[131] Je suis persuad\u00e9 que les craintes de la plaignante \u00e9taient l\u00e9gitimes et raisonnables, compte tenu du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne cessait de communiquer avec elle, malgr\u00e9 ses nombreuses demandes pour qu\u2019il mette fin sans tarder \u00e0 ce comportement. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019un agent de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieur de Postes Canada auquel elle avait demand\u00e9 conseil en juillet 1998 lui avait dit que la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 correspondait au profil courant des harceleurs criminels. Ce renseignement n\u2019a fait que la conforter dans son opinion que l\u2019intim\u00e9 constituait une r\u00e9elle menace \u00e0 son bien-\u00eatre mental et m\u00eame physique, d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019il l\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 physiquement agress\u00e9e au moins une fois.\n[132] Dans ce contexte, je suis persuad\u00e9 que sa d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, prise en r\u00e9action \u00e0 la menace qu\u2019il posait, \u00e9tait raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible et que les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision sont, par cons\u00e9quent, recouvrables. Toutefois, la partie plaignante a l\u2019obligation de limiter ses dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats[8]. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante demande qu\u2019on lui rembourse les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019achat de la maison unifamiliale dans laquelle elle a emm\u00e9nag\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019elle a quitt\u00e9 son appartement. Je n\u2019ai aucune raison de douter de la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la plaignante, qui a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucunement l\u2019intention de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager ou de s\u2019acheter une maison avant d\u2019\u00eatre victime de harc\u00e8lement de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9; cependant, il me semble qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dans l\u2019obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuer ses pertes en cherchant dans la mesure du possible \u00e0 se reloger dans un logement comparable. Dans un tel cas, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de r\u00e9clamer les frais exc\u00e9dentaires au titre du loyer.\n[133] Je n\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve indiquant qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile, voire impossible, \u00e0 la plaignante de trouver un logement locatif qui lui aurait permis de s\u2019\u00e9loigner de l\u2019intim\u00e9. \u00c0 mon avis, il ne conviendrait pas que l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit oblig\u00e9 d\u2019assumer les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition par la plaignante d\u2019un nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u2019actif, qu\u2019elle est susceptible de revendre un jour \u00e0 profit. Autrement dit, m\u00eame si le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de la plaignante \u00e0 un endroit \u00e9loign\u00e9 de la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, la d\u00e9cision d\u2019acheter une maison ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que la plaignante n\u2019a pas droit au remboursement des d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition de sa maison en juin 1999.\n[134] Les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle a le droit de se faire rembourser sont les suivantes :\n\u2022 D\u00e9penses li\u00e9es au d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de ses meubles et autres effets personnels : 817,50 $\n\u2022 Frais de stationnement au travail (la plaignante n\u2019habite plus \u00e0 distance de marche de son lieu de travail) : 750,00\n\u2022 Avis de changement d\u2019adresse postale : 32,00\n\u2022 Nouveaux raccordements aux services publics : 95,00\n\u2022 D\u00e9penses accrues \u2013 t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire plut\u00f4t que conventionnel : 762,00\n\u2022 D\u00e9penses suppl\u00e9mentaires li\u00e9es au kilom\u00e9trage accru pour se rendre au travail et en revenir : 4 200,00\nTotal : 6 656,50 $\n[135] J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 la plaignante la somme de 6 656,50 $, afin de l\u2019indemniser des frais qu\u2019elle a engag\u00e9s par suite de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis \u00e0 son endroit (alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi).\nB. Lettre d\u2019excuses [136] La Commission et la plaignante ont demand\u00e9 une lettre d\u2019excuses de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Au moment de l\u2019audience, la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore prononc\u00e9e sur l\u2019affaire de contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u00e9coulant de la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Stevenson c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9[9]. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale devait d\u00e9terminer notamment si le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 ordonner aux parties intim\u00e9es de fournir des lettres d\u2019excuses. Dans les circonstances, la Commission et la plaignante ont demand\u00e9 le maintien de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en attendant que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ait rendu son jugement.\n[137] La Cour a prononc\u00e9 son jugement le 24 mars 2003[10] . Elle a conclu que la Loi ne saurait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme habilitant le Tribunal \u00e0 rendre de telles ordonnances. Cette d\u00e9cision a un effet obligatoire pour ce Tribunal; par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de lettre d\u2019excuses est rejet\u00e9e.\nC. Pr\u00e9judice moral [138] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi pr\u00e9cise que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de verser une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019au plus 20 000 $ \u00e0 la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante demande au tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de verser l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale.\n[139] Cette disposition, de m\u00eame que celle qui est pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3) traitant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 verser dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019acte est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 et que j\u2019examine plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, est entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 30 juin 1998. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019acte discriminatoire s\u2019est poursuivi au\u2011del\u00e0 de cette date, ces dispositions s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce[11].\n[140] Il ne fait aucun doute que le harc\u00e8lement dont la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a consid\u00e9rablement boulevers\u00e9 sa vie et \u00e9norm\u00e9ment influ\u00e9 sur son bien-\u00eatre. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, elle a d\u00e9crit les effets de la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur son \u00e9tat affectif, notamment le fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9clatait en sanglots \u00e0 l\u2019occasion, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait de plus en plus impatiente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses coll\u00e8gues de travail et d\u2019autrui, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait hant\u00e9e par l\u2019id\u00e9e de rencontrer l\u2019intim\u00e9, qu\u2019elle avait le sentiment d\u2019\u00eatre atteinte au plus profond de son \u00eatre et qu\u2019elle \u00e9prouvait de la g\u00eane. Plusieurs t\u00e9moins connaissaient bien la plaignante. Lors de leur t\u00e9moignage, ils ont d\u00e9crit l\u2019esprit d\u2019autonomie et la volont\u00e9 qui l\u2019animaient avant qu\u2019elle soit victime de harc\u00e8lement de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et comment son caract\u00e8re s\u2019\u00e9tait manifestement d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9 durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e. Son rendement professionnel s\u2019est aussi d\u00e9grad\u00e9 \u00e0 cause du stress auquel elle \u00e9tait en proie et des mesures qu\u2019elle a prises pour \u00e9viter d\u2019entrer en contact avec l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[141] Apr\u00e8s quelques mois, la plaignante a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 revenir \u00e0 une situation relativement normale. Cependant, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019\u00e9loigner de son lieu de r\u00e9sidence ant\u00e9rieur, et apr\u00e8s qu\u2019on eut adopt\u00e9 d\u2019importantes mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans son milieu de travail, lesquelles sont encore en place \u00e0 ce jour, que ce r\u00e9sultat a \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint.\n[142] Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances pertinentes, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 la plaignante une somme de 12 000 $ pour compenser le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle a souffert.\n[143] Il semble que, dans le cadre de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement relative \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre le SEPC et l\u2019AFPC, la plaignante ait re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Toutefois, mon appr\u00e9ciation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est fond\u00e9e strictement sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont directement trait \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ces dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats peuvent \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9s de ceux caus\u00e9s par la conduite des syndicats. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu qu\u2019aucun probl\u00e8me de double indemnisation ne se pose et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9falquer des sommes accord\u00e9es en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision les indemnit\u00e9s que la plaignante a re\u00e7ues de la part des syndicats.\nD. Conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e [144] La plaignante et la Commission demandent \u00e9galement l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, qui pr\u00e9cise que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[145] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve indiquant que la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e sont accablants. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a suivi plusieurs cours de sensibilisation au harc\u00e8lement sexuel et \u00e9tait, par cons\u00e9quent, pleinement en mesure de comprendre que sa conduite \u00e9tait inacceptable, voire illicite. Cependant, il a couru le risque d\u00e9raisonnable de manifester \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plaignante une inconduite importune de nature sexuelle. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a continu\u00e9 de harceler la plaignante malgr\u00e9 ses exhortations et instructions r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es voulant qu\u2019il cesse de se conduire de cette mani\u00e8re.\n[146] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu que l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait non seulement inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 mais aussi d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Dans les circonstances, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 la plaignante la somme de 15 000 $ en guise de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3).\nE. Int\u00e9r\u00eats [147] Toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision donnent droit au versement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats (par. 53(4) de la Loi). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple, sur une base annuelle, en se fondant sur un taux \u00e9quivalant au taux d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). En ce qui concerne l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral et l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9, les int\u00e9r\u00eats courront \u00e0 compter du 10 mars 1998, soit la date o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 a sexuellement harcel\u00e9 la plaignante dans sa voiture, et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du paiement. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats vers\u00e9s sur chacune de ces indemnit\u00e9s ne devront en aucun cas faire en sorte qu\u2019on d\u00e9passe le maximum permis de 20 000 $[12]. Comme les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es au d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de la plaignante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es \u00e0 divers moments, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de l\u2019audience, j\u2019ordonne que les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces d\u00e9penses courent \u00e0 compter de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du paiement.\nF. Formation et conseils pour pr\u00e9venir le harc\u00e8lement sexuel [148] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a suivi plusieurs cours de sensibilisation au harc\u00e8lement sexuel \u2013 la plupart avant ou durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 il a harcel\u00e9 la plaignante. Le dernier cours qu\u2019il a suivi s\u2019inscrivait dans le cadre des r\u00e9primandes qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ues de Postes Canada apr\u00e8s que Mme Hine eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate. La Commission a soutenu qu\u2019en d\u00e9pit de cette formation, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais modifi\u00e9 son comportement et continue encore de pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais harcel\u00e9 sexuellement la plaignante. La Commission a fait remarquer que les cours que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a suivis ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e9taient d\u2019une dur\u00e9e relativement br\u00e8ve \u2013 jamais plus d\u2019une journ\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit contraint de suivre un ensemble de s\u00e9ances de formation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et intensive, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi.\n[149] Une telle formation est \u00e0 mon avis justifi\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne que l\u2019intim\u00e9 suive un cours sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u2019au moins trois jours complets. Le cours sera choisi par la Commission. Les frais raisonnables pour suivre ce cours de formation seront \u00e0 la charge de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nG. Maintien de la comp\u00e9tence [150] Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence pour le cas o\u00f9 surviendrait un diff\u00e9rend relativement \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre des mesures de redressement et au calcul des indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

Faits [1] Keith Dawson, le plaignant en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en date du 27 f\u00e9vrier 1996 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Dans sa plainte contre la bande indienne d\u2019Eskasoni, M. Dawson all\u00e8gue que le chef et le conseil d\u2019Eskasoni ont exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination en raison de sa race et de sa couleur (blanche), en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, en refusant de lui accorder des prestations d\u2019aide sociale parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas membre de la bande.\n[2] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits devant le Tribunal. Selon cet expos\u00e9, les parties ont convenu des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\nM. Dawson est un homme de race blanche qui n\u2019est pas membre de la bande indienne d\u2019Eskasoni et qui n\u2019est pas admissible \u00e0 ce statut puisqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas un Indien inscrit. M. Dawson vit dans la r\u00e9serve d\u2019Eskasoni avec sa femme, une Indienne inscrite qui est membre de la bande. Il est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 vivre dans la r\u00e9serve en raison de son mariage avec sa conjointe indienne. Eskasoni administre un r\u00e9gime d\u2019assistance sociale \u00e0 l\u2019intention des personnes admissibles qui vivent dans la r\u00e9serve, en vertu d\u2019une entente de financement MAINC-Premi\u00e8res nations visant les exercices 2003\u20112004 \u00e0 2007\u20112008. Des ententes de financement similaires sont en place depuis 1987. Du fait qu\u2019il vit dans la r\u00e9serve, M. Dawson n\u2019est pas admissible aux prestations provinciales d\u2019aide sociale. En 1988, M. Dawson a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Eskasoni une demande de prestations d\u2019aide sociale. Il s\u2019est vu refuser l\u2019octroi de telles prestations du fait que, par principe, Eskasoni n\u2019accorde pas de prestations d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 des personnes qui ne sont pas membres de la bande. En 1996, M. Dawson a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Eskasoni une nouvelle demande de prestations d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 la suite de la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans MacNutt c. Bande indienne de Shubenacadie, [1995] D.C.D.P. no 14, affaire dont les faits \u00e9taient similaires et dans laquelle le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 que le fait de refuser d\u2019accorder des prestations d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 une personne qui n\u2019est pas un Indien inscrit allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Eskasoni a refus\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau d\u2019acquiescer \u00e0 sa demande parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas membre de la bande.\n[3] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Eskasoni a admis que M. Dawson a droit \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019aide sociale. Eskasoni a accept\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 M. Dawson une somme forfaitaire correspondant au total des prestations d\u2019aide sociale auxquelles il \u00e9tait admissible au cours de la p\u00e9riode comprise entre juillet 1998 et le 2 juin 2003, la date de l\u2019audience, moins 100 $ pour chaque mois de cette p\u00e9riode, montant qui, selon les estimations de M. Dawson, \u00e9quivaut au revenu qu\u2019il a gagn\u00e9 en occupant divers emplois \u00e0 temps partiel. Eskasoni a consenti \u00e0 verser des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur ce montant net pour la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. Eskasoni a \u00e9galement accept\u00e9 d\u2019inscrire le nom de M. Dawson sur sa liste des personnes vivant dans la r\u00e9serve qui sont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de prestations d\u2019aide sociale au 2 juin 2003.\n[4] Enfin, Eskasoni a consenti \u00e0 renoncer et \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire consistant \u00e0 refuser d\u2019accorder des prestations d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 des personnes qui ne sont pas membres de la bande mais qui, autrement, sont admissibles.\nII. D\u00e9cision [5] La Commission et M. Dawson ont \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner qu\u2019Eskasoni, en guise de mesures de redressement, verse une indemnit\u00e9 de 20 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi et une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 20 000 $ aux termes du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, en raison des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s actes d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis.\n[6] Avant le 30 juin 1998, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale que le Tribunal pouvait accorder en cas de conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e, de pr\u00e9judice moral ou d\u2019atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 personnelle \u00e9tait de 5 000 $. Depuis le 30 juin 1998, date de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur des modifications contenues dans le projet de loi S\u20115, la Loi pr\u00e9voit une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral et de 20 000 $ pour conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[7] M. Dawson a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en 1996. La Commission a soutenu que les modifications contenues dans le projet de loi S\u20115 s\u2019appliquent quand m\u00eame. Elle a simplement fait valoir que le refus d\u2019accorder des prestations d\u2019aide sociale est un acte discriminatoire de longue date de la part d\u2019Eskasoni. Elle n\u2019a invoqu\u00e9 aucun autre motif ni fondement juridique.\n[8] Je n\u2019accepte pas cet argument car, pour qu\u2019une modification l\u00e9gislative ait automatiquement un effet r\u00e9troactif, il suffirait que le plaignant continue de subir les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement survenu il y a longtemps. L\u2019analyse doit \u00eatre et est beaucoup plus complexe, comme en fait foi la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel du Canada, (2001) 39 C.H.R.R. D\/237, p. D\/288 \u00e0 290. Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal, pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision, a conclu que l\u2019application de l\u2019article 53, tel que modifi\u00e9 en 1998, est strictement prospective. Je fais miens les motifs invoqu\u00e9s dans Nkwazi; par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale que ce Tribunal peut accorder \u00e0 M. Dawson en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, est de 5 000 $.\n[9] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Dawson a dit que les seuls emplois qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de trouver, durant la p\u00e9riode 1988\u20111996, \u00e9taient occasionnels et \u00e0 temps partiel. Lorsqu\u2019il a cess\u00e9 de recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, il a fait une demande \u00e0 Eskasoni car il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 des prestations provinciales d\u2019aide sociale. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, il a indiqu\u00e9 que le refus d\u2019Eskasoni l\u2019avait grandement boulevers\u00e9. Il estimait qu\u2019il avait cotis\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime pendant vingt ans lorsqu\u2019il travaillait mais que cela ne lui importait gu\u00e8re, car il se disait qu\u2019il aurait peut-\u00eatre besoin d\u2019aide sociale un jour. Cependant, lorsque ce jour est arriv\u00e9, on a refus\u00e9 de lui accorder des prestations. \u00c0 son avis, on a refus\u00e9 de lui accorder les [TRADUCTION] droits fondamentaux dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient le reste des citoyens de notre pays \u2013 pourquoi?. M. Dawson a exprim\u00e9 les m\u00eames sentiments dans une lettre en date du 8 octobre 1996 qu\u2019il a \u00e9crite \u00e0 la Commission.\n[10] Selon l\u2019entente de financement MAINC-Premi\u00e8res nations et plus particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3.01e) du chapitre 3 intitul\u00e9 Lignes directrices, politiques et proc\u00e9dures concernant les services communautaires autochtones, M. Dawson \u00e9tait nettement en droit de recevoir d\u2019Eskasoni des prestations d\u2019aide sociale. Cependant, en 1988, la bande a rejet\u00e9 sa demande, indiquant qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas membre de celle\u2011ci. En 1996, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal eut rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire MacNutt, selon laquelle une telle politique ou pratique \u00e9tait discriminatoire, Eskasoni a encore refus\u00e9 de lui verser des prestations d\u2019aide sociale.\n[11] Eskasoni a fait valoir qu\u2019elle attendait la d\u00e9cision finale de l\u2019appel dans l\u2019affaire MacNutt avant de r\u00e9examiner sa politique consistant \u00e0 ne pas accorder d\u2019aide sociale aux personnes qui ne sont pas membres de la bande. \u00c0 mon avis, Eskasoni a agi de fa\u00e7on inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e en continuant d\u2019agir comme elle le faisait alors qu\u2019il existait une d\u00e9cision juridique claire et nette indiquant qu\u2019un tel acte \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Sur la foi des divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve expos\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus, je conclus que M. Dawson devrait recevoir l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 5 000 $ que pr\u00e9voyait le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi avant que celle\u2011ci ne soit modifi\u00e9e.\nIII. Int\u00e9r\u00eats [12] Il ne reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat applicable au montant net \u00e0 verser au titre des prestations d\u2019aide sociale. La Commission a soutenu que ce taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat devrait correspondre au taux qui s\u2019applique aux obligations d\u2019\u00e9pargne du Canada, soit 5 % en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Eskasoni a pour sa part pr\u00e9tendu que le taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat devait \u00eatre de 2 %. Ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des parties n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa position.\n[13] La r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019\u00e0 moins d\u2019une ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire, les int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s de la fa\u00e7on qui y est d\u00e9crite. Ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des parties ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019arguments voulant que ce Tribunal rende une ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire. Par cons\u00e9quent, les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 verser par Eskasoni \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du montant net auquel M. Dawson a droit pour la p\u00e9riode allant de juillet 1998 au 2 juin 2003 au titre des prestations d\u2019aide sociale doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9(12).\nIV. Ordonnance [14] Le Tribunal ordonne :\nqu\u2019Eskasoni renonce et mette fin \u00e0 son acte discriminatoire qui consiste \u00e0 refuser d\u2019accorder des prestations d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 des r\u00e9sidents de la r\u00e9serve d\u2019Eskasoni qui ne sont pas membres de la bande mais qui, autrement, sont admissibles; qu\u2019Eskasoni verse \u00e0 M. Dawson une somme forfaitaire correspondant aux prestations d\u2019aide sociale auxquelles il avait droit pendant la p\u00e9riode allant de juillet 1998 au 2 juin 2003, moins 100 $ pour chaque mois de cette p\u00e9riode, plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur la somme forfaitaire pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre juillet 1988 et le 2 juin 2003. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal; qu\u2019Eskasoni inscrive le nom de M. Dawson sur la liste de ses b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires d\u2019aide sociale au 2 juin 2003, afin qu\u2019il re\u00e7oive les prestations d\u2019aide sociale auxquelles il a droit \u00e0 compter de cette date; qu\u2019Eskasoni verse \u00e0 M. Dawson une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 5 000 $ conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, telle que libell\u00e9e avant qu\u2019elle ne soit modifi\u00e9e. Cette indemnit\u00e9 n\u2019ouvre pas droit au versement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[15] Si elles sont incapables de s\u2019entendre sur le montant \u00e0 verser \u00e0 M. Dawson au titre des prestations d\u2019aide sociale ou sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur cette somme, les parties doivent en informer le Tribunal au plus tard le 15 juillet 2003. Je r\u00e9serve ma comp\u00e9tence pour trancher ces questions dans une telle \u00e9ventualit\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJ.

Elle demande au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer qui doit assumer les co\u00fbts reli\u00e9s au r\u00e9tablissement du r\u00e9gime de retraite auquel elle aurait eu droit n'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de son licenciement.\n[4] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es de la demande de Suzanne Larente.\n[5] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle n'avait aucune repr\u00e9sentation \u00e0 lui soumettre relativement \u00e0 la demande de Suzanne Larente.\n[6] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada a soumis au Tribunal des repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites et la jurisprudence applicable. Elle soutient que la demande de Suzanne Larente est irrecevable puisque la d\u00e9cision et les ordonnances rendues par le Tribunal, le 23 avril 2003, sont finales. Le Tribunal n'a plus aucune juridiction; il est functus officio. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne peut se saisir de la demande de Suzanne Larente.\n[7] Les repr\u00e9sentations de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 Suzanne Larente qui a fait conna\u00eetre ses commentaires et pr\u00e9tentions.\n[8] Le Tribunal dispose des arguments des parties. Il estime \u00eatre suffisamment \u00e9clair\u00e9 pour prendre position sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire d'entendre les parties.\n[9] Par sa demande, la plaignante, Suzanne Larente, souhaite que le Tribunal statue sur la marche \u00e0 suivre dans l'ex\u00e9cution de la d\u00e9cision qu'il a rendue. Il s'agirait donc pour le Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer s'il a juridiction pour rouvrir le dossier et entendre une preuve additionnelle pour dicter l'ex\u00e9cution de sa d\u00e9cision.\n[10] Dans la d\u00e9cision rendue, le Tribunal ne s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aucune juridiction quant \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de l'ordonnance relative au r\u00e9tablissement du r\u00e9gime de retraite auquel Suzanne Larente aurait eu droit si elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9e.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, d\u00e8s que le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision, celle-ci est finale. Le Tribunal perd ainsi toute juridiction. Il devient li\u00e9 par la r\u00e8gle du functus officio. L'expression juridique functus officio, suivant le Black's Law Dictionary, se d\u00e9finit ainsi :\nL'autorit\u00e9 qui n'a plus comp\u00e9tence ou qui n'a plus de pouvoirs parce qu'elle s'est acquitt\u00e9e de ses fonctions, a cess\u00e9 d'exercer sa charge ou a rempli sa mission.\n[12] Au surplus, l'article 57 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit clairement que l'ex\u00e9cution des ordonnances d'un Tribunal rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[13] Consid\u00e9rant la r\u00e8gle du functus officio et la jurisprudence en cette mati\u00e8re, le Tribunal conclut que la r\u00e8gle du functus officio trouve son application \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et qu'il n'a pas juridiction pour d\u00e9terminer qui doit assumer les co\u00fbts reli\u00e9s au r\u00e9tablissement du r\u00e9gime de retraite auquel Suzanne Larente aurait eu si elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9e.\nConclusion [14] En cons\u00e9quence, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRoger Doyon\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 26 juin 2003\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T638\/2601\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Suzanne Larente c.

Maintien de la comp\u00e9tence\n[1] Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte que Mireille Des Rosiers a fait l'objet de la part de Jean Barbe, son superviseur \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada (la SRC ), d'un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur plusieurs motifs de distinction illicite, \u00e0 savoir le sexe (f\u00e9minin), la race (noire) et l'origine nationale ou ethnique (ha\u00eftienne), en contravention de l'art. 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi ) (1).\nI. LES PARTIES \u00c0 LA PLAINTE [2] Le 1er avril 2003, soit environ cinq semaines avant la date pr\u00e9vue du d\u00e9but de l'audience, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission ) a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle se retirait officiellement en tant que partie. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission n'a pas pris part \u00e0 l'audience et aucune observation n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en son nom.\n[3] Le 15 avril 2003, au cours d'une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique que j'ai tenue, l'avocat de M. Barbe, Me Cl\u00e9ment Groleau, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'avait plus de mandat pour repr\u00e9senter son client. Me Groleau a indiqu\u00e9 que M. Barbe \u00e9tait en voie de se mettre en faillite. M. Barbe a lui-m\u00eame confirm\u00e9 la chose au cours d'une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique subs\u00e9quente. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il ne compara\u00eetrait pas \u00e0 l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce. En fait, ni M. Barbe ni aucun mandataire le repr\u00e9sentant n'a comparu \u00e0 l'audience qui a dur\u00e9 trois jours et qui s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9difice de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Selon le dossier du Tribunal, plusieurs avis indiquant la date, le lieu et l'heure de l'audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment signifi\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Barbe, qui r\u00e9side \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\n[4] Le premier jour de l'audience, une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter Mme Des Rosiers comme partie et, fait plus important, comme coplaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Le formulaire de plainte, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 8 mars 1999, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par Mme Des Rosiers mais plut\u00f4t par un repr\u00e9sentant d'un organisme sans but lucratif d'aide aux victimes de harc\u00e8lement appel\u00e9 Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec Inc. (le Groupe d'aide ). Mme Des Rosiers a demand\u00e9 l'aide du Groupe d'aide apr\u00e8s les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de discrimination. Elle-m\u00eame et une repr\u00e9sentante du Groupe d'aide, Linda Smith, se sont rendues ensemble au bureau de la Commission pour d\u00e9poser la plainte. Mme Smith a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience que l'employ\u00e9 de la Commission qui a re\u00e7u la plainte a recommand\u00e9 qu'un repr\u00e9sentant du Groupe d'aide signe le document \u00e0 la place de Mme Des Rosiers.\n[5] La requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter Mme Des Rosiers comme partie a \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Groupe d'aide. Pour les motifs que j'ai consign\u00e9s au dossier officiel, j'ai fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du Groupe d'aide. J'ai soulign\u00e9 qu'en vertu du paragraphe 40(1) de la Loi, un groupe d'individus ayant des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire peut d\u00e9poser une plainte, que la victime fasse partie ou non du groupe en question. Le paragraphe 53(2) pr\u00e9cise que le Tribunal peut imposer des mesures en faveur de la victime et non n\u00e9cessairement de la partie plaignante. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'est pas essentiel, semble-t-il, que la victime soit la partie plaignante pour obtenir r\u00e9paration en vertu de la Loi.\n[6] Cependant, j'ai \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que l'alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant l'adjonction de parties ou d'intervenants \u00e0 une affaire. Dans Desormeaux c. OC Transpo (2), on a soutenu que cette disposition permet d'envisager la possibilit\u00e9 que le Tribunal autorise l'adjonction d'une partie, m\u00eame \u00e0 titre de plaignant. Ce pouvoir doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec une certaine prudence, particuli\u00e8rement dans les cas o\u00f9 il pourrait en r\u00e9sulter une injustice envers l'une des autres parties. N'ayant pas comparu \u00e0 l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Barbe ne s'est pas oppos\u00e9 officiellement \u00e0 l'adjonction de Mme Des Rosiers comme partie. Dans ma d\u00e9cision, j'ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que m\u00eame si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par le Groupe d'aide, la plainte porte exclusivement sur des \u00e9v\u00e9nements v\u00e9cus par Mme Des Rosiers pendant la p\u00e9riode qu'elle travaillait avec M. Barbe. L'adjonction de Mme Des Rosiers comme partie \u00e0 cette affaire ne soul\u00e8ve pas de nouvelles questions ou de nouveaux faits dont M. Barbe n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 au courant. Compte tenu de tous ces facteurs, j'ai conclu qu'aucun probl\u00e8me d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 ne se poserait si le Tribunal autorisait l'adjonction de Mme Des Rosiers comme partie \u00e0 titre de plaignante \u00e0 ce stade-ci et j'ai, par cons\u00e9quent, fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[7] Par suite du retrait de la Commission et de l'absence de M. Barbe, l'audience s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e en pr\u00e9sence de seulement deux parties, soit Mme Des Rosiers et le Groupe d'aide, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par Mme Smith. Ni l'une ni l'autre de ces parties n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par avocat \u00e0 l'audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, les faits relat\u00e9s dans cette d\u00e9cision sont fond\u00e9s exclusivement sur la preuve produite par les plaignantes.\nII. LES FAITS [8] Mme Des Rosiers est une Noire d'origine ha\u00eftienne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Elle a r\u00e9sid\u00e9 pendant quelques ann\u00e9es en Californie, o\u00f9 elle a obtenu un dipl\u00f4me en marketing de la University of California \u00e0 Los Angeles (UCLA) et travaill\u00e9 dans l'industrie de la radio et de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision - pour le compte de la American Broadcasting Radio. \u00c0 son retour \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de poursuivre sa carri\u00e8re dans le m\u00eame domaine et a trouv\u00e9 un emploi dans une station radiophonique priv\u00e9e locale. En 1996, le directeur de cette station l'a inform\u00e9e d'un projet mis en place \u00e0 la SRC qui visait \u00e0 int\u00e9grer au sein de son effectif des membres de groupes minoritaires.\n[9] Dans le cadre de ce projet, le minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral du Patrimoine canadien subventionnait l'embauche de stagiaires et leur salaire pendant les trois premiers mois. Si l'employeur d\u00e9cidait de garder le stagiaire \u00e0 la fin de cette p\u00e9riode, le programme continuait de payer une partie de son salaire pendant plusieurs mois. Mme Micheline L\u00e9onard \u00e9tait la charg\u00e9e de projet au moment o\u00f9 Mme Des Rosiers a postul\u00e9 un poste de stagiaire vers la fin de 1996. Mme L\u00e9onard a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience que les coordonnateurs du projet voulaient \u00e9viter de donner aux autres employ\u00e9s de la SRC l'impression que ces stagiaires \u00e9taient embauch\u00e9s uniquement en raison de leur appartenance \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible. Par cons\u00e9quent, les candidats ont d\u00fb se soumettre \u00e0 un processus complexe et intensif d'examens et d'entrevues.\n[10] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Des Rosiers a confirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 ce processus. Elle se souvient qu'environ huit candidatures avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retenues sur les quelques 300 re\u00e7ues. La sienne \u00e9tait du nombre. \u00c0 son avis, la vaste connaissance du milieu artistique que son exp\u00e9rience en radiodiffusion lui avait permis d'acqu\u00e9rir a beaucoup jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l'embaucher pour l'\u00e9mission de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision \u00e0 laquelle elle a travaill\u00e9. Cette \u00e9mission, qui s'appelait La vie d'artiste, consistait principalement en des interviews et des reportages au sujet de personnalit\u00e9s du monde artistique, notamment des acteurs, des auteurs dramatiques et des po\u00e8tes.\n[11] Mme Des Rosiers a d'abord travaill\u00e9 comme recherchiste. Au bout d'un certain temps, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 des fonctions de recherchiste-productrice et elle a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 devant la cam\u00e9ra. L'\u00e9mission \u00e9tait produite par une \u00e9quipe. M. Barbe, le chef de pupitre, \u00e9tait le superviseur de l'\u00e9quipe.\n[12] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Des Rosiers a relat\u00e9 les divers incidents de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harc\u00e8lement qui se sont produits durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 sous la surveillance de M. Barbe. Une description chronologique de ces incidents est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ci-apr\u00e8s.\nA. D\u00e9cembre 1996 [13] La premi\u00e8re fois o\u00f9 il a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Des Rosiers, M. Barbe a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que l'autre recherchiste de l'\u00e9quipe, Johanne Comte, \u00e9tait sa conjointe. Devant l'insistance de M. Barbe, Mme Des Rosiers s'est sentie oblig\u00e9e d'indiquer que Mme Comte devait n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre bien comp\u00e9tente puisqu'elle avait obtenu le poste. Mme Des Rosiers a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9e par la r\u00e9ponse de M. Barbe : Je m'en fous de ses comp\u00e9tences, c'est son cul qui m'int\u00e9resse.\n[14] Plus tard ce mois-l\u00e0, Jocelyn Barnab\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait le superviseur de M. Barbe et l'un des r\u00e9alisateurs de l'\u00e9mission, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers une petite faveur, demande \u00e0 laquelle elle s'est pli\u00e9e. M. Barbe est all\u00e9 trouver Mme Des Rosiers par la suite pour lui dire qu'elle aurait d\u00fb se montrer plus agressive et refuser d'aider M. Barnab\u00e9. M. Barbe a ajout\u00e9 que certaines de ses anciennes petites amies \u00e9taient de race noire. Il lui a alors conseill\u00e9 de baiser si elle voulait conna\u00eetre du succ\u00e8s.\nB. Janvier 1997 [15] M. Barbe a mentionn\u00e9 lors d'une r\u00e9union \u00e0 laquelle participait Mme Des Rosiers qu'il cherchait quelqu'un pour s'occuper de sa chienne lorsqu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la ville. Lorsque quelqu'un assis \u00e0 la table a demand\u00e9 si Mme Des Rosiers serait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, M. Barbe a r\u00e9pondu : Elle devrait s'entendre avec Charlotte, elle est noire comme elle.\n[16] Toujours en janvier 1997, l'\u00e9quipe de production \u00e9tait en train de manger au restaurant Chez Miville, situ\u00e9 dans la Maison de Radio-Canada, l'\u00e9difice de la SRC \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Lors du repas, Mme Des Rosiers a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle connaissait l'ex-directeur de la Division de la culture et des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 la SRC. Ayant entendu ce commentaire, M. Barbe a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle devait avoir obtenu l'emploi en raison de cette relation, ajoutant Est-ce que c'\u00e9tait bon? . Mme Des Rosiers a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la remarque comme impliquant qu'elle avait eu des relations sexuelles avec l'ancien directeur.\nC. F\u00e9vrier 1997 [17] Malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 collabor\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reportages, Mme Des Rosiers a remarqu\u00e9 que son nom ne figurait jamais au g\u00e9n\u00e9rique. \u00c0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, elle a inform\u00e9 M. Barbe de son d\u00e9sir de faire un reportage sur la Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. Il s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e, indiquant qu'un reportage de cette nature devrait obligatoirement \u00eatre fait par un Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois : La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, c'est les Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois qui devraient faire \u00e7a.\n[18] Le m\u00eame mois, Mme Des Rosiers a coproduit un reportage sur la carri\u00e8re du dramaturge Michel Tremblay, dans lequel on soulignait que ses pi\u00e8ces avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 traduites en 127 langues. Dans cette optique, Mme Des Rosiers avait inclus dans le reportage plusieurs interviews avec des commentateurs \u00e9trangers (italiens, roumains, japonais et ha\u00eftiens-cr\u00e9oles). Le commentateur ha\u00eftien, qui se trouvait \u00e0 \u00eatre le fr\u00e8re de Mme Des Rosiers, est un auteur prim\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vice-pr\u00e9sident de l'Union des \u00e9crivains et \u00e9crivaines qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Au cours du pr\u00e9visionnement du reportage, M. Barbe a fait \u00e0 voix haute la remarque suivante : Je suis contre l'Ha\u00eftien dans le reportage.\nD. Mars 1997 [19] Mme Des Rosiers se souvient que M. Barbe et Mme Comte sont entr\u00e9s dans son bureau \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9. Mme Comte tenait dans ses mains une photographie d'un humoriste r\u00e9put\u00e9 de race noire qui est d'origine ha\u00eftienne, Anthony Kavanaugh. Mme Comte a \u00e9pingl\u00e9 la photo sur le tableau d'affichage de Mme Des Rosiers en lui disant : Voici ton nouveau chum. M. Barbe a ensuite ajout\u00e9 : Tu devrais t'accoupler avec. M. Barbe et Mme Comte ont formul\u00e9 ces remarques malgr\u00e9 le fait que Mme Des Rosiers \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e.\n[20] Mme Des Rosiers rappelle \u00e9galement d'\u00eatre entr\u00e9e un jour dans le bureau de M. Barnab\u00e9 alors qu'il se trouvait en compagnie de M. Barbe et de Mme Comte. Il y avait sur la table en face d'eux plusieurs photographies. Lorsque Mme Des Rosiers est entr\u00e9e dans le bureau, Mme Comte en a pris une et la lui a remise. M. Barbe \u00e9tait nu sur la photographie en question. Mme Des Rosiers ne sait pas pourquoi on lui a montr\u00e9 cette photographie, si ce n'est pour qu'elle se sente mal \u00e0 l'aise.\nE. Avril 1997 [21] M. Barbe a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'une des secr\u00e9taires du bureau qu'il avait remarqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait chang\u00e9 la couleur de ses cheveux. Se retournant ensuite vers Mme Des Rosiers, il lui a dit qu'elle paraissait plus blanche que d'habitude.\nF. Mai 1997 [22] Lors d'un party \u00e0 la fin de la saison de diffusion, M. Barbe a dit \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers qu'elle devrait aller danser : C'est dans votre sang. Il a ensuite ajout\u00e9 en se tenant les parties sexuelles : Si tu danses, tu auras un beau cadeau. Il a \u00e9galement fait des commentaires sur ses seins, demandant s'ils \u00e9taient v\u00e9ritables . Mme Des Rosiers a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que M. Barbe avait fait des commentaires similaires au sujet de ses seins durant toute la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle avait travaill\u00e9 pour lui.\nG. Ao\u00fbt 1997 [23] Lors d'une r\u00e9union de l'\u00e9quipe de production, M. Barbe a fait la remarque suivante : J'ai engag\u00e9 des laiss\u00e9s pour compte, des Arabes, des Noirs, des Juifs. Il me reste juste des handicap\u00e9s. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait payant d'embaucher des membres des minorit\u00e9s en raison des subventions obtenues. Mme Comte a mis son grain de sel, affirmant qu'elle \u00e9tait contre \u00e0 ce genre de choses : Moi, je suis contre ces avantages qu'on donne aux minorit\u00e9s. Mme Des Rosiers a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offusqu\u00e9e, d'autant plus qu'elle avait elle-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e dans le cadre d'un programme d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en emploi. Elle s'est n\u00e9anmoins abstenue de faire quelque commentaire que ce soit \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\nH. Septembre 1997 [24] Mme Des Rosiers a propos\u00e9 de faire un reportage sur l'auteur fran\u00e7ais Marcel Proust. M\u00eame si l'id\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien re\u00e7ue par M. Barnab\u00e9, M. Barbe s'est moqu\u00e9e de sa suggestion, pr\u00e9cisant qu'elle devrait faire des reportages sur la culture cr\u00e9ole. \u00c0 cette occasion, elle s'est retourn\u00e9e vers lui et lui a dit : L\u00e2che-moi . Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, elle a affirm\u00e9 que durant toute la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 avec lui, M. Barbe n'a cess\u00e9 de lui r\u00e9p\u00e9ter : Fais donc quelque chose sur le cr\u00e9ole.\nI. Octobre 1997 [25] Au cours d'une r\u00e9union de production, un autre employ\u00e9 a propos\u00e9 de faire un reportage sur la musique africaine. Les participants se sont ensuite demand\u00e9s quel musicien on pourrait interviewer. M. Barbe a formul\u00e9 \u00e0 cette occasion la remarque suivante en se tournant vers Mme Des Rosiers : Elle devrait conna\u00eetre cet Africain que tu cherches. Tous les Noirs se connaissent. Mme Des Rosiers a feint de ne pas avoir entendu la remarque. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s plusieurs petites attaques r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9es pour l'inciter \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre, elle a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 que c'en \u00e9tait assez et qu'on devrait passer \u00e0 autre chose.\nJ. Novembre 1997 [26] Le 24 novembre 1997, Mme Des Rosiers a rencontr\u00e9 une connaissance, Mme Micha\u00eblle Jean, pr\u00e8s de l'entr\u00e9e principale de la Maison de Radio-Canada. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, Mme Jean, qui est elle aussi de race noire, \u00e9tait chef d'antenne du t\u00e9l\u00e9journal du R\u00e9seau de l'information (RDI), la station de nouvelles de langue fran\u00e7aise de la SRC . Alors que Mme Des Rosiers lui expliquait certains incidents de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harc\u00e8lement survenus au travail, M. Barbe, M. Barnab\u00e9 et un autre employ\u00e9 de sexe masculin de la SRC sont, par pure co\u00efncidence, pass\u00e9s devant elles. Apr\u00e8s que Mme Des Rosiers eut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 Mme Jean aux trois hommes, M. Barbe a lanc\u00e9 : Mais c'est quoi? C'est une r\u00e9union de femmes noires? C'est quoi, l\u00e0, les Noires se r\u00e9unissent? .\n[27] M. Barbe a ensuite indiqu\u00e9 qu'il avait vu Mme Jean dans le studio o\u00f9 la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre mod\u00e8le de race noire, Iman, avait r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9e, ajoutant que si Mme Jean se trouvait l\u00e0, c'\u00e9tait sans doute parce qu'elle \u00e9tait noire elle aussi. \u00c0 l'audience Mme Jean a confirm\u00e9 que ces commentaires avaient bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 faits. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle avait trouv\u00e9 pour le moins bizarre les commentaires persistants de M. Barbe sur la couleur de la peau. Mme Des Rosiers a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Barbe avait poursuivi la conversation et compar\u00e9 la couleur de la peau des deux femmes, se demandant laquelle avait le teint le plus p\u00e2le.\n[28] Lorsque Mme Des Rosiers est retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 son bureau, une quinzaine de minutes apr\u00e8s cette rencontre fortuite, M. Barbe \u00e9tait assis dans son fauteuil, les pieds sur son pupitre. Lorsqu'elle est entr\u00e9e dans la pi\u00e8ce, il lui a dit : Tu te tiens avec les Noirs maintenant, hein? .\nK. F\u00e9vrier 1998 [29] La deuxi\u00e8me semaine du mois avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e Semaine de l'histoire des Noirs . L'\u00e9v\u00e9nement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien publicis\u00e9 au sein de la SRC. Des affiches avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 appos\u00e9es un peu partout dans le lieu de travail pour l'occasion. Le lundi de cette semaine-l\u00e0, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait assise dans son bureau, elle a remarqu\u00e9 que M. Barbe et plusieurs employ\u00e9s dansaient, chantaient et riaient devant sa porte. M. Barbe portait une perruque de style rastafari et \u00e9tait coiff\u00e9 d'un chapeau semblable \u00e0 ceux que portent les Jama\u00efcains. Ses \u00e9paules \u00e9taient recouvertes du drapeau de la Jama\u00efque. Il se pavanait dans l'aire de travail en bougeant ses mains \u00e0 la hauteur de ses aisselles, comme pour imiter un singe. Plus tard, la perruque a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au bout d'une perche \u00e0 laquelle \u00e9tait attach\u00e9 un t-shirt en haillons, et M. Barbe et d'autres employ\u00e9s ont parad\u00e9 en tenant dans leurs mains cet objet.\n[30] Cette semaine-l\u00e0, cette activit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e chaque jour. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Des Rosiers a dit qu'elle s'\u00e9tait sentie tellement humili\u00e9e qu'elle avait pris des dispositions pour travailler \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du bureau le vendredi, afin de ne pas avoir \u00e0 c\u00f4toyer ses coll\u00e8gues. Presque tous les employ\u00e9s, m\u00eame M. Barnab\u00e9, ont plus ou moins pris part au rituel en question. Mme Des Rosiers a fait remarquer qu'elle \u00e9tait la seule membre d'un groupe minoritaire visible au sein de l'\u00e9quipe de production de La vie d'artiste.\n[31] \u00c0 peu pr\u00e8s une semaine plus tard, il y a eu une r\u00e9union des employ\u00e9s au restaurant Chez Miville. \u00c0 la fin de la r\u00e9union, alors qu'elle se levait de table, Mme Des Rosiers a accidentellement renvers\u00e9 un verre d'eau. M. Barbe a aussit\u00f4t fait la remarque suivante : C'est pas \u00e9tonnant qu'elle renverse un verre avec son gros cul d'Africaine. Elle s'est alors tourn\u00e9e vers M. Barbe d'un air f\u00e2ch\u00e9, puis a quitt\u00e9. Un coll\u00e8gue, Claude Laforest, a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait entendu \u00e0 cette occasion M. Barbe faire un commentaire qui avait fait rire tout le monde \u00e0 la table, mais qu'il ne se souvenait pas des mots exacts.\n[32] Durant une autre r\u00e9union de production, tenue le 28 f\u00e9vrier 1998, l'\u00e9quipe a constat\u00e9 qu'elle avait besoin d'un autre reportage pour compl\u00e9ter une des prochaines \u00e9missions. Mme Des Rosiers a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait presque termin\u00e9 le reportage qu'on lui avait confi\u00e9 sur les Ha\u00eftiens et a propos\u00e9 qu'on se rabatte sur celui-ci pour combler le vide. M. Barbe s'est alors retourn\u00e9 vers elle et lui a dit qu'elle devrait ajouter \u00e0 son reportage des m\u00e2les n\u00e8gres en sueur , pr\u00e9cisant que c'est toujours beau des n\u00e8gres en sueur . Faisant semblant qu'elle n'avait pas entendu les commentaires de M. Barbe, Mme Des Rosiers a continu\u00e9 de discuter du reportage avec M. Barnab\u00e9. Soudainement, M. Barbe s'est pench\u00e9 vers elle et lui a dit Mireille, ta gueule, ta gueule .\nL. Avril 1998 [33] Durant une r\u00e9union de production, une jeune employ\u00e9e a dit combien elle \u00e9tait craintive \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e d'aller chez son dentiste. Tout le monde \u00e0 table a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 relater des exp\u00e9riences p\u00e9nibles avec les m\u00e9decins. M. Barbe a indiqu\u00e9 que l'un de ses pires exp\u00e9riences avait consist\u00e9 \u00e0 faire examiner son p\u00e9nis pour d\u00e9terminer s'il avait contract\u00e9 une maladie. Apr\u00e8s avoir racont\u00e9 son histoire, M. Barbe s'est retourn\u00e9 vers Mme Des Rosiers et lui a dit que c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 cause d'une de ses s\u009curs \u00e0 elle qu'il pouvait avoir contract\u00e9 la maladie.\nM. Les d\u00e9marches entreprises par Mme Des Rosiers et leurs cons\u00e9quences [34] Mme Des Rosiers s'est parfois entretenue avec Mme L\u00e9onard de certains des incidents relat\u00e9s ci-dessus, notamment du commentaire de M. Barbe au sujet de sa chienne, de ses d\u00e9clarations au sujet de l'embauche de membres de minorit\u00e9s et de sa remarque \u00e0 propos du verre qu'elle avait renvers\u00e9. Mme Des Rosiers a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle h\u00e9sitait \u00e0 se plaindre trop fort par crainte d'\u00eatre accus\u00e9e par d'autres de dramatiser. Elle a fait remarquer que M. Barbe \u00e9tait encore son patron et qu'elle craignait qu'en d\u00e9posant des plaintes officielles contre lui, elle nuirait \u00e0 sa propre carri\u00e8re et ajouterait de l'huile sur le feu.\n[35] En f\u00e9vrier 1998, Mme Des Rosiers a appris que le bureau de Mme L\u00e9onard avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Barnab\u00e9 de la conduite de M. Barbe. Quelques jours plus tard, Mme Des Rosiers a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Barnab\u00e9 de la situation. Il a soutenu que la conduite de M. Barbe n'\u00e9tait ni sexiste ni raciste et qu'apr\u00e8s tout, il n'\u00e9tait qu'un iconoclaste . En outre, M. Barnab\u00e9 a dit \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers que si elle allait jusqu'au bout avec ses plaintes, elle perdrait son emploi et serait la seule \u00e0 en souffrir. \u00c0 la mi-avril 1998, Mme Des Rosiers a discut\u00e9 de la question avec le service des ressources humaines de la SRC; toutefois, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle n'a re\u00e7u aucun conseil particulier, si ce n'est l'assurance que le service communiquerait avec elle incessamment.\n[36] Vers la fin d'avril 1998, M. Barbe a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Des Rosiers \u00e0 l'instigation de M. Barnab\u00e9. M. Barbe a commenc\u00e9 par s'excuser aupr\u00e8s de Mme Des Rosiers. Toutefois, il a ajout\u00e9 que, de toute fa\u00e7on, ce n'\u00e9tait pas une insulte que de traiter les gens de gros cul africain , car il aimait les gros culs. Mme Des Rosiers n'a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'excuses, estimant plut\u00f4t que c'\u00e9tait une autre humiliation.\n[37] Elle all\u00e9gue qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, on a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 saboter son travail. Par exemple, elle prenait des rendez-vous pour interviewer des invit\u00e9s en vue de ses reportages et l'\u00e9quipe cin\u00e9matographique \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9e ailleurs, de sorte qu'elle se retrouvait dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'enregistrer les interviews. Elle all\u00e9gue que des interviews qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es avaient subs\u00e9quemment \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 d'autres membres de l'\u00e9quipe.\n[38] \u00c0 la mi-mai 1998, Mme Des Rosiers a rencontr\u00e9 un repr\u00e9sentant de la Commission, qui l'a inform\u00e9e qu'il existait une politique sur le harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 la SRC. Personne n'avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers de cette politique auparavant. La Commission lui ayant conseill\u00e9 de faire part officiellement de ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l'employeur le plus t\u00f4t possible, afin de respecter les d\u00e9lais prescrits par la politique, Mme Des Rosiers a envoy\u00e9 sa lettre de plainte au pr\u00e9sident de la SRC le 19 mai 1998.\n[39] Les activit\u00e9s dans le cadre de la saison de diffusion de l'\u00e9mission en question ont pris fin en juin. Mme Des Rosiers a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e par la SRC que sa plainte faisait l'objet d'une enqu\u00eate. Le service des ressources humaines de la SRC lui a fourni l'assurance que son emploi n'\u00e9tait pas en danger tout en lui disant qu'elle devrait retourner \u00e0 son bureau au d\u00e9but de la nouvelle saison, soit le 17 ao\u00fbt 1998. Cependant, lorsqu'elle est entr\u00e9e dans son bureau \u00e0 cette date-l\u00e0, elle a constat\u00e9 que tous ses effets personnels n'y \u00e9taient plus. La pi\u00e8ce \u00e9tait occup\u00e9e par M. Barbe, qui lui a dit que c'\u00e9tait maintenant son bureau. Un peu plus tard, elle a entendu M. Barbe qui parlait \u00e0 M. Barnab\u00e9 dans le bureau de ce dernier. Lorsqu'elle s'est approch\u00e9e d'eux pour s'enqu\u00e9rir de ce qu'il \u00e9tait advenu de ses effets, M. Barbe a quitt\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce. M. Barnab\u00e9 lui a alors dit qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle avait port\u00e9 plainte au pr\u00e9sident de la SRC, il ne voulait plus l'avoir dans son service. Il a alors accompagn\u00e9 Mme Des Rosiers jusqu'au service des ressources humaines, o\u00f9 un autre individu lui a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'on ne voulait plus d'elle \u00e0 cet endroit et qu'elle devait quitter l'immeuble sans tarder, sans quoi on ferait appel au service de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[40] Dans les jours qui ont suivi, Mme Des Rosiers a communiqu\u00e9 avec la superviseure de M. Barnab\u00e9, qui lui a d'abord indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle aurait d\u00fb s'attendre \u00e0 un tel traitement \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte. Cependant, une fois que Mme Des Rosiers eut expliqu\u00e9 que la plainte initiale aupr\u00e8s de M. Barnab\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le bureau de Mme L\u00e9onard, l'attitude de la superviseure a chang\u00e9 et elle accept\u00e9 d'aider Mme Des Rosiers \u00e0 trouver un autre emploi au sein de la SRC. Malheureusement, Mme Des Rosiers n'a obtenu qu'un contrat d'un mois et a fait par la suite des travaux \u00e0 la pige, jusque vers mai 1999. Incapable de gagner sa vie en travaillant ainsi de fa\u00e7on sporadique, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher un autre emploi. Finalement, le 10 octobre 2000, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par le service de marketing d'Air Canada, o\u00f9 elle travaille \u00e0 ce jour.\n[41] Comme je l'ai indiqu\u00e9 ci-haut, le Groupe d'aide a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte contre M. Barbe le 8 mars 1999. Apparemment, une plainte a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre la SRC, mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e alors que la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u00e9tait pendante devant la Commission. Au cours des mois qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce, une question pr\u00e9liminaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e au sujet de la divulgation \u00e0 M. Barbe du protocole de r\u00e8glement. La pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal s'est prononc\u00e9e sur la question le 2 avril 2003 (3). \u00c0 la suite de cette d\u00e9cision, certaines parties de l'entente de r\u00e8glement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9es. Toutefois, ce document n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 produit \u00e0 l'audience et je ne l'ai pas vu.\nIII. LE DROIT [42] Aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d'emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Le sexe, la race et l'origine nationale ou ethnique figurent parmi les motifs de distinction illicite (par. 3(1)). Le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite (par. 14(2)).\n[43] Comme l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Inc. (4), le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail peut \u00eatre d\u00e9fini de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d'emploi pour la victime. La Cour a fait remarquer que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail est une atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la victime et \u00e0 son respect de soi \u00e0 la fois comme employ\u00e9 et comme \u00eatre humain. Le cadre d'analyse des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement sexuel s'applique \u00e9galement, soutient-on, aux cas de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur d'autres motifs de distinction illicite, tels que la race et l'origine nationale ou ethnique (5).\n[44] Pour qu'une plainte de harc\u00e8lement soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, il faut que soient r\u00e9unies les conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s (6).\nOn doit d\u00e9montrer que la conduite du harceleur \u00e9tait, de par sa nature, li\u00e9e au motif de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9 (7). Le harc\u00e8lement, particuli\u00e8rement dans les cas de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, peut se manifester sur le plan physique (p. ex., pincements, \u00e9treintes, caresses, baisers). Il peut \u00e9galement prendre la forme d'un comportement verbal (p. ex., insultes ou remarques concernant le sexe, la race ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique d'un individu; ainsi que des commentaires concernant l'apparence d'une personne ou ses habitudes sexuelles). Pour d\u00e9terminer si le comportement reproch\u00e9 est li\u00e9 \u00e0 un des motifs de distinction illicite, le tribunal se fonde sur le crit\u00e8re de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances, compte tenu des normes sociales existantes. Les comportements faisant l'objet de la plainte \u00e9taient importuns. Autrement dit, il faut d\u00e9terminer si la conduite du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harceleur \u00e9tait d\u00e9sir\u00e9e ou sollicit\u00e9e. Pour ce faire, on peut tenir compte de la r\u00e9action de la partie plaignante au moment o\u00f9 sont survenus les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de harc\u00e8lement et d\u00e9terminer si celle-ci a express\u00e9ment ou par son comportement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la conduite \u00e9tait importune. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si un refus verbal a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9 dans tous les cas et le fait d'omettre \u00e0 maintes reprises de r\u00e9pondre aux commentaires suggestifs peut \u00eatre une indication au pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harceleur que sa conduite \u00e9tait importune. En pareil cas, la norme \u00e0 appliquer en vue d'appr\u00e9cier la conduite reproch\u00e9e est celle de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il faut, pour qu'il y ait harc\u00e8lement, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, m\u00eame si dans certaines circonstances un seul incident peut suffire \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile. On se fonde une fois de plus sur le crit\u00e8re objectif de la personne raisonnable pour \u00e9valuer cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment.\n[45] Dans une affaire de harc\u00e8lement sexuel - Stadnyk c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'immigration), la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 que dans les cas o\u00f9 il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d'un t\u00e9moignage d'expert qui confirme que l'interaction homme-femme pourrait \u00eatre per\u00e7ue diff\u00e9remment par les hommes et par les femmes, le tribunal devrait appliquer le crit\u00e8re juridique du point de vue de la femme raisonnable pour \u00e9valuer la conduite reproch\u00e9e (8).\nIV. L'ANALYSE A. Cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la preuve [46] La partie intim\u00e9e n'ayant pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience, le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Des Rosiers n'a, de toute \u00e9vidence, pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit. Malgr\u00e9 cela, j'ai trouv\u00e9 que Mme Des Rosiers \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible. Son t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 clair et \u00e9loquent. J'ai remarqu\u00e9 que les dates que Mme Des Rosiers a cit\u00e9es lors de son t\u00e9moignage pour quelques-uns des incidents diff\u00e9raient de celles mentionn\u00e9es dans la plainte \u00e9crite pr\u00e9par\u00e9e en mars 1999. Par exemple, selon le formulaire de plainte, la remarque de M. Barbe au sujet de sa chienne, Charlotte, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en d\u00e9cembre 1997 plut\u00f4t qu'en janvier 1997. De m\u00eame, le commentaire de M. Barbe \u00e0 propos de Mme Des Rosiers voulant qu'elle paraisse plus blanche que d'habitude aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9, indique-t-on, en octobre 1997 plut\u00f4t qu'en avril 1997. Je ne per\u00e7ois pas ces lacunes comme une faiblesse dans son t\u00e9moignage. Au contraire, elles permettent de d\u00e9montrer que plut\u00f4t que de s'en remettre aveugl\u00e9ment aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments inscrits sur le formulaire de plainte, Mme Des Rosiers a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en fonction du souvenir qu'elle avait des incidents. Le fait qu'elle se soit peut-\u00eatre m\u00e9prise lors de son t\u00e9moignage sur le mois ou l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 s'est produit tel ou tel incident n'est pas vraiment important. Je remarque \u00e9galement que les t\u00e9moins que Mme Des Rosiers et le Groupe d'aide ont cit\u00e9s ont indiqu\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient pas discut\u00e9 avec les plaignantes au sujet de leur temoignage et que leur t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur le souvenir que chacun d'eux avait des faits et a corrobor\u00e9 dans une certaine mesure celui de Mme Des Rosiers.\nB. La conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e9tait-elle li\u00e9e au sexe, \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique? [47] Mme Des Rosiers all\u00e8gue que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Barbe, telle que d\u00e9crite dans son t\u00e9moignage, est li\u00e9e \u00e0 au moins un, sinon \u00e0 plusieurs, des motifs de distinction illicite \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Loi.\n[48] Il ressort clairement de l'ensemble de la preuve que le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harc\u00e8lement de la part de M. Barbe \u00e9tait en partie de nature sexuelle, ainsi qu'en t\u00e9moignent le geste en direction de ses parties sexuelles qu'il a fait lors de la partie au bureau en mai 1997, ses commentaires r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s au sujet des seins de Mme Des Rosiers, son conseil selon lequel elle devrait baiser , son insinuation voulant qu'elle ait obtenu son emploi parce qu'elle avait couch\u00e9 avec un membre de la haute direction de la SRC.\n[49] Cependant, le harc\u00e8lement exerc\u00e9 par M. Barbe n'\u00e9tait pas uniquement de nature sexuelle. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement li\u00e9 \u00e0 des facteurs comme la race et l'origine de Mme Des Rosiers. Les comparaisons de M. Barbe entre la couleur de la peau de Mme Des Rosiers et celle de sa chienne, sa d\u00e9claration selon laquelle danser \u00e9tait dans son sang et ses commentaires racistes au sujet de ses attributs physiques \u00e9taient des commentaires offensants. Il se faisait un point d'honneur de prof\u00e9rer, en sa pr\u00e9sence, des commentaires racistes d\u00e9sobligeants envers les Africains et les Noirs. Il manifestait, de par son comportement, un d\u00e9go\u00fbt pour tout ce qui avait trait \u00e0 son origine ha\u00eftienne. Son insistance pour qu'elle fasse un reportage sur la culture cr\u00e9ole \u00e9tait marqu\u00e9e au coin de la condescendance, comme s'il voulait indiquer qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable, en raison de son origine ethnique, de faire des commentaires sur la culture qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise ou francophone. Le port par M. Barbe de la perruque de style rastafari repr\u00e9sentait un comportement m\u00e9prisant et avilissant qui \u00e9tait de nature fonci\u00e8rement raciste et profond\u00e9ment insultant pour tous les Noirs, qu'ils soient d'origine jama\u00efcaine, ha\u00eftienne ou autre.\n[50] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Barbe \u00e9tait li\u00e9e tant\u00f4t au sexe, tant\u00f4t \u00e0 la race, tant\u00f4t \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique de Mme Des Rosiers.\nC. La conduite de M. Barbe \u00e9tait-elle importune? [51] D'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Des Rosiers, il est \u00e9vident que le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 comportement discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit n'\u00e9tait ni souhait\u00e9 ni sollicit\u00e9. \u00c0 plusieurs occasions, elle lui a ouvertement indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle trouvait ses commentaires offensants. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, elle \u00e9tait tellement exasp\u00e9r\u00e9e par ses remarques incessantes au sujet de la pr\u00e9paration d'un reportage sur la culture cr\u00e9ole qu'elle a r\u00e9pondu L\u00e2che-moi! . De m\u00eame, lorsque M. Barbe lui a demand\u00e9, \u00e0 la suite de sa rencontre avec Micha\u00eblle Jean, si elle avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se tenir avec des Noirs, Mme Des Rosiers a r\u00e9pondu, l'air offens\u00e9, Pardon! .\n[52] Cependant, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Mme Des Rosiers n'a pas en apparence r\u00e9agi aux commentaires de M. Barbe, feignant de ne pas les avoir entendus. J'accepte son explication selon laquelle M. Barbe \u00e9tait, apr\u00e8s tout, son patron; elle craignait les cons\u00e9quences qu'un affrontement avec lui aurait sur sa carri\u00e8re, compte tenu particuli\u00e8rement de sa situation de simple stagiaire. C'est la raison pour laquelle elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s'attaquer au probl\u00e8me indirectement, pour ainsi dire, en exprimant ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 M. Barnab\u00e9 et \u00e0 Mme L\u00e9onard, dans l'espoir que ces personnes seraient mieux plac\u00e9es pour transmettre le message \u00e0 M. Barbe. Par exemple, elle s'est plainte \u00e0 M. Barnab\u00e9 de la remarque de M. Barbe selon laquelle ce n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 elle de faire un reportage sur la Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. Malheureusement, M. Barnab\u00e9 \u00e9tait r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 intervenir; en fait, il s'est port\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de M. Barbe, faisant valoir que ce dernier n'\u00e9tait pas vraiment raciste ni sexiste et qu'il n'\u00e9tait qu'un iconoclaste . Quoi qu'il en soit, Mme Des Rosiers a \u00e9ventuellement constat\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait gu\u00e8re compter sur la compr\u00e9hension de M. Barnab\u00e9, compte tenu du fait qu'il avait lui-m\u00eame particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la mascarade - pour reprendre le terme qu'elle a elle-m\u00eame utilis\u00e9 - organis\u00e9e autour de la perruque de style rastafari.\n[53] Par ailleurs, il est d\u00e9raisonnable de penser que M. Barbe ait jamais consid\u00e9r\u00e9 sa conduite \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Des Rosiers comme opportune. Comment quelqu'un pourrait-il raisonnablement conclure que Mme Des Rosiers, une Noire de descendance ha\u00eftienne, aurait pu trouver opportuns sa mascarade, ses gestes grossiers en direction de ses parties sexuelles, ses remarques r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es au sujet de ses seins, sa comparaison entre elle et sa chienne et ses nombreux commentaires au sujet des Noirs et des Ha\u00eftiens. Il serait ridicule de penser cela.\n[54] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu que, dans les circonstances, la fa\u00e7on dont Mme Des Rosiers a r\u00e9agi au comportement reproch\u00e9 \u00e9tait raisonnable et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la conduite de M. Barbe \u00e9tait importune.\nD. La conduite reproch\u00e9e comportait-elle un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de gravit\u00e9 suffisant pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile? [55] La conduite discriminatoire de M. Barbe a commenc\u00e9 d\u00e8s sa premi\u00e8re rencontre avec Mme Des Rosiers, au moment o\u00f9 il a fait \u00e0 son endroit une remarque sexuellement offensante voulant qu'il ne soit int\u00e9ress\u00e9 que par le cul de sa coll\u00e8gue, et a persist\u00e9 tout au cours de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission La vie d'artiste. Certains aspects particuliers de sa conduite \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s graves. C'est le cas notamment de sa mascarade avec la perruque de style rastafari qui a dur\u00e9 une semaine compl\u00e8te. \u00c0 mon avis, ce seul acte \u00e9tait grave au point qu'on pourrait raisonnablement conclure que Mme Des Rosiers travaillait dans un milieu hostile. Si l'on ajoute \u00e0 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment la myriade d'autres commentaires et actes offensants de M. Barbe \u00e0 son endroit, qui avaient trait \u00e0 de nombreuses facettes de l'identit\u00e9 de Mme Des Rosiers (sa race, son sexe et son origine nationale ou ethnique) ainsi qu'\u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9 en tant que personne, il ne fait aucun doute que son milieu de travail \u00e9tait empoisonn\u00e9.\n[56] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime, pour toutes ces raisons, que M. Barbe a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Des Rosiers un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur les trois motifs de distinction illicite cit\u00e9s dans la plainte : la race, le sexe et l'origine nationale ou ethnique.\nV. LES MESURES DE REDRESSEMENT A. Pertes salariales [57] Mme Des Rosiers a demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e des pertes salariales qu'elle a subies en raison du non-renouvellement de son contrat de travail concernant l'\u00e9mission La vie d'artiste (alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi). M\u00eame si c'est M. Barnab\u00e9 qui l'a inform\u00e9e le 17 ao\u00fbt 1998 qu'elle ne serait pas r\u00e9embauch\u00e9e pour la saison 1998-1999, Mme Des Rosiers a pr\u00e9tendu, en s'appuyant sur une preuve circonstancielle, que M. Barbe a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans cette d\u00e9cision. Elle a fait remarquer que lorsqu'elle est retourn\u00e9e au travail le 17 ao\u00fbt, M. Barbe occupait son bureau et lui a dit que c'\u00e9tait le sien. Elle a dit se souvenir \u00e9galement que M. Barnab\u00e9 lui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, lorsqu'on lui avait confi\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches suppl\u00e9mentaires pour deux ou trois autres \u00e9missions de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, que c'\u00e9tait M. Barbe qui avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui offrir cette occasion. Enfin, elle a pr\u00e9tendu que la personne qui l'a remplac\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission La vie d'artiste \u00e9tait quelqu'un que M. Barbe connaissait tr\u00e8s bien. Compte tenu de ces faits, elle a conclu que M. Barbe y \u00e9tait pour quelque chose dans la d\u00e9cision de ne pas renouveler son contrat.\n[58] En fait, il se peut que M. Barbe n'ait pas voulu que Mme Des Rosiers revienne au sein de l'\u00e9quipe charg\u00e9e de l'\u00e9mission et il est m\u00eame possible qu'il ait fait part de cette opinion \u00e0 M. Barnab\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, compte tenu de la preuve dont j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, la d\u00e9cision de refuser le renouvellement du contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par M. Barnab\u00e9 ou peut-\u00eatre par le service des ressources humaines de la SRC, mais certainement pas par M. Barbe. Il convient de souligner que le repr\u00e9sentant du service des ressources humaines qui a conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers de quitter l'immeuble le 17 ao\u00fbt 1998, ainsi que M. Barnab\u00e9, ont tous deux clairement indiqu\u00e9 qu'ils \u00e9taient outr\u00e9s de l'envoi d'une lettre de plainte au pr\u00e9sident de la SRC. Je ne suis pas convaincu que la d\u00e9cision de ne pas renouveler le contrat soit attribuable, ne serait-ce qu'en partie, \u00e0 M. Barbe.\n[59] Cependant, il reste encore une question connexe \u00e0 examiner. M\u00eame si M. Barbe n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de ne pas r\u00e9embaucher Mme Des Rosiers, est-ce que la d\u00e9cision de ne pas renouveler le contrat \u00e9tait indirectement li\u00e9e \u00e0 son comportement discriminatoire? N'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 du harc\u00e8lement exerc\u00e9 par M. Barbe, Mme Des Rosiers n'aurait pas port\u00e9 plainte et \u00e9crit au pr\u00e9sident de la SRC. M. Barnab\u00e9, d'autre part, a dit \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e de l'\u00e9mission \u00e0 cause de la lettre.\n[60] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne s'est pench\u00e9 sur une situation similaire dans Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel du Canada (no 4) (9). Dans cette affaire, la plaignante, qui pr\u00e9tendait que sa superviseure l'avait harcel\u00e9e, s'\u00e9tait plainte \u00e0 la direction, qui avait r\u00e9agi en exer\u00e7ant des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 l'endroit de la plaignante et en ne renouvelant pas son contrat d'employ\u00e9e occasionnelle. Le Tribunal en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion suivante (10) :\nL'indemnisation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne vise \u00e0 remettre la victime dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si le tort ne s'\u00e9tait pas produit, sous r\u00e9serve des principes de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 des dommages et de l'att\u00e9nuation des pertes. En l'esp\u00e8ce, je suis convaincue qu'il existe un lien de cause \u00e0 effet entre les actes discriminatoires originaux et la perte par Mme Nkwazi de son emploi : si Mme Neufeld n'avait pas trait\u00e9 Mme Nkwazi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire, celle-ci ne serait pas plainte \u00e0 son sujet \u00e0 la direction du CPR et il n'y aurait pas eu de repr\u00e9sailles. Autrement dit, les dommages qui r\u00e9sultent du non-renouvellement du contrat d'employ\u00e9e occasionnelle de Mme Nkwazi d\u00e9coulent du fait que Mme Neufeld a contrevenu \u00e0 la Loi, et peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s dans l'optique de la r\u00e9paration.\nLa d\u00e9cision de M. Barnab\u00e9 de refuser de renouveler le contrat de Mme Des Rosiers \u00e9tait-elle une cons\u00e9quence raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible du harc\u00e8lement exerc\u00e9 par M. Barbe? Les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u00e9coulant du non-renouvellement du contrat d\u00e9coulent-ils du fait que M. Barbe a contrevenu \u00e0 l'art. 14 de la Loi? Je remarque que dans l'affaire Nkwazi, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait l'employeur institutionnel, soit le Service correctionnel du Canada, et non la personne ayant commis l'acte discriminatoire \u00e0 l'endroit de la plaignante. Par cons\u00e9quent, c'est l'employeur qui a au bout du compte \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 responsable de la perte de revenus d\u00e9coulant de sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas renouveler le contrat de travail de la plaignante (11).\n[61] En l'occurrence, M. Barbe n'est pas l'employeur et j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que la preuve est insuffisante pour corroborer la pr\u00e9tention voulant qu'il ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le non-renouvellement du contrat de Mme Des Rosiers. Dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Green (12), la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s en tenant compte des notions que sont le caract\u00e8re indirect et la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9. La Cour a cit\u00e9 un extrait de l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des motifs du juge Marceau dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan) (13) :\nLe but vis\u00e9 demeure le m\u00eame : \u00e9carter les cons\u00e9quences de l'acte qui sont trop lointaines compte tenu de tous les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont lieu entre les deux. Quelle que soit la source de responsabilit\u00e9, le bon sens s'applique.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que les pertes salariales subies par Mme Des Rosiers par suite de la d\u00e9cision ind\u00e9pendante prise par l'employeur, la SRC (telle qu'exprim\u00e9e par la conduite du r\u00e9alisateur de l'\u00e9mission, M. Barnab\u00e9, et peut-\u00eatre par le repr\u00e9sentant du service des ressources humaines de la SRC), de refuser de renouveler le contrat de Mme Des Rosiers pour l'\u00e9mission La vie d'artiste, rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re trop indirect par rapport \u00e0 la conduite discriminatoire de M. Barbe. Ce serait d\u00e9fier jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point le bon sens que de tenir M. Barbe responsable des actes discriminatoires de la tierce partie, dans lesquels je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le.\n[62] Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Des Rosiers n'a pas droit \u00e0 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats de la part de M. Barbe pour ses pertes salariales.\nB. D\u00e9penses [63] Mme Des Rosiers pr\u00e9tend qu'elle devrait \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e de certaines d\u00e9penses qu'elle a subies en raison de l'acte discriminatoire commis par M. Barbe (alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi).\n[64] Mme Des Rosiers r\u00e9clame, entre autres, les honoraires des avocats qu'elle a consult\u00e9s en 1998. Elle reconna\u00eet que ces d\u00e9penses avaient trait au grief qu'elle entendait d\u00e9poser contre la SRC et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 certaines difficult\u00e9s qu'elle a eues \u00e0 convaincre son syndicat de d\u00e9poser le grief. \u00c0 proprement parler, ces d\u00e9penses n'ont pas rapport \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte contre M. Barbe et, par cons\u00e9quent, n'ouvrent pas droit \u00e0 un remboursement (14).\n[65] En outre, Mme Des Rosiers demande qu'on l'indemnise des honoraires de consultation qu'elle a vers\u00e9s \u00e0 deux psychologues entre septembre 1998 et juin 2000. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que sa sant\u00e9 physique et mentale s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e en raison du harc\u00e8lement exerc\u00e9 par M. Barbe. Je suis convaincu que ces services professionnels \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9s et directement li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire commis par M. Barbe. Ces honoraires totalisent 1 515 $. Des photocopies des factures \u00e0 l'appui de ces d\u00e9penses n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Barbe ou \u00e0 son avocat avant l'audience. Cependant, dans l'un des documents que la Commission a communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'avocat de M. Barbe en mars 2003, il est indiqu\u00e9 que l'envoi des factures \u00e9tait imminent. Au cours des semaines qui ont suivi, ni M. Barbe ni son avocat n'a soulev\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal quelque question que ce soit en ce qui touche cette divulgation partielle. De toute \u00e9vidence, la consignation en preuve de ces re\u00e7us n'a fait l'objet d'aucune opposition du fait que la partie intim\u00e9e n'a pas pris part \u00e0 l'audience. Je remarque que les sommes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es pour ces consultations psychologiques sont raisonnables et correspondent, en moyenne, \u00e0 60 $ par visite. Compte tenu de tous ces facteurs, je suis convaincu que Mme Des Rosiers a droit d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e de ces d\u00e9penses.\n[66] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 M. Barbe de verser \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers la somme de 1 515 $ en guise de remboursement des honoraires de consultation.\nC. Dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires [67] Mme Des Rosiers demande que lui soient vers\u00e9es, en vertu de la version actuelle de la Loi, une indemnit\u00e9 pour compenser le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'elle a souffert par suite de l'acte discriminatoire (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e)), ainsi qu'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale du fait que l'acte discriminatoire commis par M. Barbe \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 (par. 53(3)). L'indemnit\u00e9 maximale qui peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e en vertu de chacune des dispositions pertinentes est de 20 000 $.\n[68] Avant que soient apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi les modifications qui sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur le 30 juin 1998 (15), l'indemnit\u00e9 dont pouvait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier la victime \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires \u00e9tait limit\u00e9e \u00e0 5 000 $ (par. 53(3) de la version ant\u00e9rieure de la Loi). Dans Nkwazi (16), le Tribunal a soutenu que dans les cas o\u00f9 la conduite discriminatoire s'est produite avant cette date, les limites ant\u00e9rieures s'appliquent.\n[69] En juin 1998, la saison de diffusion de l'\u00e9mission La vie d'artiste avait pris fin et Mme Des Rosiers n'avait plus de contact avec M. Barbe. Dans la plainte \u00e9crite, il est indiqu\u00e9 que le dernier acte de harc\u00e8lement consign\u00e9 au dossier sont les pseudo-excuses pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par M. Barbe lors de la rencontre o\u00f9 il a pr\u00e9tendu que ce n'est pas une insulte que de traiter quelqu'un de gros cul africain . Cet incident s'est produit en avril 1998. Au cours du mois de mai, M. Barbe \u00e9tait en Europe et n'a pas eu de contact avec Mme Des Rosiers. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Des Rosiers a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'une partie de son travail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sabot\u00e9e apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut officiellement port\u00e9 plainte contre M. Barbe; cependant, ces incidents se sont produits au plus tard \u00e0 la mi-juin 1998.\n[70] Le seul fait qui, dans le contexte des rapports avec M. Barbe et l'\u00e9quipe de La vie d'artiste, se soit produit selon les all\u00e9gations de Mme Des Rosiers apr\u00e8s le 30 juin 1998, c'est l'avis de son cong\u00e9diement, qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 le 17 ao\u00fbt 1998. Comme je l'ai expliqu\u00e9 ci-haut, le non-renouvellement du contrat de Mme Des Rosiers ne peut \u00eatre li\u00e9 \u00e0 la conduite discriminatoire de M. Barbe. En outre, M. Barbe n'a pas harcel\u00e9 Mme Des Rosiers au cours de l'un ou l'autre des brefs \u00e9changes qu'il a eus avec elle ce jour-l\u00e0 (dans son bureau ou dans celui de M. Barnab\u00e9). Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Des Rosiers n'a pas fait \u00e9tat d'autres rencontres ou contacts avec M. Barbe apr\u00e8s cette date.\n[71] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la conduite discriminatoire de M. Barbe s'est produite enti\u00e8rement avant les modifications du 30 juin 1998 \u00e0 la Loi. Je suis contraint d'appliquer les dispositions que renfermait l'article 53 au moment o\u00f9 s'est produit l'acte discriminatoire. Selon la version ant\u00e9rieure du paragraphe 53(3), l'indemnit\u00e9 maximale que le Tribunal peut accorder s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte discriminatoire est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 ou que la victime en a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral est de 5 000 $.\n[72] Je suis convaincu que la conduite discriminatoire de M. Barbe \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et parfois m\u00eame inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Par exemple, sa d\u00e9cision de parader en portant une perruque de style rastafari \u00e0 la vue de la seule employ\u00e9e de race noire durant la Semaine de l'histoire des Noirs avait strictement pour but d'humilier Mme Des Rosiers. Ses nombreux autres commentaires et gestes vulgaires et insultants au sujet de sa race, de son origine et de son sexe \u00e9taient pour le moins mesquins et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits en ne tenant aucunement compte des cons\u00e9quences sur le plan affectif ou du point de vue de son bien-\u00eatre.\n[73] De m\u00eame, je suis convaincu que Mme Des Rosiers a souffert un pr\u00e9judice profond sur le plan effectif et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son estime de soi. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, les actes de harc\u00e8lement dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime en raison \u00e0 la fois de son sexe, de sa race et de sa culture ont aggrav\u00e9 sa douleur et les effets de la discrimination. Les insultes prof\u00e9r\u00e9es s'ajoutaient \u00e0 l'insinuation qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas une vraie Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise.\n[74] Compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances, j'ordonne \u00e0 M. Barbe de verser \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers la somme de 5 000 $ en guise de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de la version ant\u00e9rieure de la Loi.\nD. Don au Groupe d'aide [75] Les plaignantes demandent que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 M. Barbe de faire un don au Groupe d'aide. Mme Smith a soulign\u00e9 que le Groupe d'aide est un organisme de bienfaisance sans but lucratif compos\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9voles qui vient en aide aux victimes de harc\u00e8lement. L'aide fournie par le groupe \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers et tout au cours des proc\u00e9dures devant le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 utile, d'autant plus que la Commission s'est retir\u00e9e un peu avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience.\n[76] Cependant, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de redressement est enti\u00e8rement r\u00e9gie par la Loi. Aucun des recours pr\u00e9vus par l'article 53 de la Loi ne permet d'ordonner \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e d'indemniser qui que ce soit d'autre que la victime de l'acte discriminatoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande des plaignantes est rejet\u00e9e.\nE. Int\u00e9r\u00eats [77] Les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision ouvrent droit au versement d'int\u00e9r\u00eats (par. 53(4) de la Loi). Toutefois, comme j'ai accord\u00e9 l'indemnit\u00e9 maximale que pr\u00e9voyait la version ant\u00e9rieure de la Loi \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires, aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat n'est payable sur cette somme (17). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur le reste doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s sur une base annuelle, \u00e0 taux simple, en se fondant sur un taux \u00e9quivalant au taux d'escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle), pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre la date de la plainte (8 mars 1999) et celle du paiement final.\nF. Lettre d'excuses [78] Les plaignantes demandent que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 M. Barbe de pr\u00e9senter une lettre sinc\u00e8re d'excuses \u00e0 Mme Des Rosiers. Vu la d\u00e9cision rendue r\u00e9cemment par la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Stevenson c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (18), selon laquelle le Tribunal n'a pas le pouvoir de rendre de telles ordonnances, cette requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\nG. Cour de sensibilisation aux droits de la personne [79] Mme Smith a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que le Groupe d'aide offre au public, entre autres, des cours de sensibilisation au harc\u00e8lement et aux droits de la personne. Les plaignantes demandent que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 M. Barbe de suivre une telle formation.\n[80] Compte tenu du comportement de M. Barbe, il est \u00e9vident qu'il saurait profiter d'une pareille formation. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 M. Barbe de suivre un cours sur le harc\u00e8lement et les droits de la personne qu'organisera le Groupe d'aide de concert avec la Commission, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi. Le cours en question comprendra au moins une et au plus trois journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes de formation. Le co\u00fbt raisonnable de cette formation sera assum\u00e9 par M. Barbe.\nH. Maintien de la comp\u00e9tence [81] Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence pour le cas o\u00f9 surviendrait un diff\u00e9rend relativement \u00e0 la mise en \u009cuvre des mesures de redressement et le calcul des indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n\u00ab Originale sign\u00e9e par \u00bb\nAthanasios D.

CONCLUSION\nVIII. MAINTIEN DE LA COMP\u00c9TENCE\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le plaignant, Martin Desrosiers ( Desrosiers ) all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience et sur sa situation de famille en ce que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes ( la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ), l'intim\u00e9e, n'a pas retenu sa candidature en septembre 1997 pour un poste d'Analyste de gestion CS-03. Les raisons invoqu\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9e, selon le plaignant, \u00e9taient qu'il ne rencontrait pas les exigences physiques du poste et que le poste requ\u00e9rait du travail en soir\u00e9e ce qui s'accordait mal \u00e0 ses obligations familiales.\n[2] En cons\u00e9quence, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9e a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et ce, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6 ( la loi ).\n[3] Les parties ont \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 au tribunal de traiter, en premier lieu, de la question \u00e0 savoir s'il y a eu en l'esp\u00e8ce un acte discriminatoire et, dans l'affirmative, si cet acte discriminatoire s'explique par une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de la jurisprudence et de la Loi. En deuxi\u00e8me lieu, si la plainte s'av\u00e8re fond\u00e9e, les parties demandent que le tribunal maintienne sa comp\u00e9tence pour convoquer une deuxi\u00e8me audience afin de permettre aux parties de pr\u00e9senter de la preuve et des plaidoiries sur la question de la r\u00e9paration.\nII. ADMISSIONS DE FAITS CONJOINTES [4] Au d\u00e9but de l'audience, les parties se sont entendues sur les faits suivants :\nDesrosiers est un employ\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 depuis le 6 mai 1987. Depuis son embauche, Desrosiers a occup\u00e9 plusieurs emplois au sein de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Le 22 mai 1988, il fut promu surveillant \u00e0 temps plein au niveau 2. Le 15 juillet 1991, il est nomm\u00e9 au poste d'Analyste d'affaires au niveau cadre MGT 1.5. Le 11 octobre 1993, suite \u00e0 une mutation lat\u00e9rale, Desrosiers devient Analyste de communication cadre (MGT 1.5). En novembre 1993, le Syndicat des employ\u00e9s des postes et communications, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada est accr\u00e9dit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'agent n\u00e9gociateur pour approximativement 2 800 employ\u00e9s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Desrosiers est un de ces 2 800 employ\u00e9s. Le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1994, le poste MGT 1.5 de Desrosiers est devenu exc\u00e9dentaire. Le 12 janvier 1995, Desrosiers subit un accident de travail et s'absente du travail jusqu'au 19 mai 1996. Lors de cet accident de travail, Desrosiers a subi une blessure au dos affectant ses capacit\u00e9s fonctionnelles au travail. Le 25 janvier 1995, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 informe Desrosiers que son poste classifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant MGT est reclassifi\u00e9 au niveau AS-03. Afin de faciliter la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de Desrosiers \u00e0 l'emploi, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 obtient un rapport musculo-squelettique du Movement and Analysis Treatment Centre mettant en exergue les limites fonctionnelles de Desrosiers telles qu'elles \u00e9taient \u00e9valu\u00e9es en date du 17 mai 1996. Le 19 mai 1996, Desrosiers est r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 \u00e0 son emploi tel qu'il existait au moment de son accident de travail en janvier 1995. Le 10 juin 1996, Desrosiers comble un poste d'Analyste, D\u00e9veloppement technique, classifi\u00e9 au niveau AS-03, en assignation temporaire. Le 27 janvier 1997, Desrosiers accepte une affectation permanente \u00e0 l'Institut de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans un poste d'Agent, lequel poste est classifi\u00e9 de niveau AS-02. Malgr\u00e9 la classification AS-02 accept\u00e9e par Desrosiers, le 27 janvier 1997, Desrosiers conserve toujours son statut d'employ\u00e9 classifi\u00e9 au niveau sup\u00e9rieur de AS-03. Le 19 mai 1998, Desrosiers obtient un poste permanent en tant qu'Analyste en communications. Le poste est classifi\u00e9 de niveau AS-03. En ao\u00fbt 1997, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 affiche un concours portant le num\u00e9ro de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 97-RID-13, pour un poste d'Analyste de gestion, classifi\u00e9 au niveau CS-03. La date limite pour la soumission de candidatures pour le concours 97-RID-13 \u00e9tait le 29 ao\u00fbt 1997. Le 7 ao\u00fbt 1997, Desrosiers soumet sa candidature pour le concours 97-RID-13 \u00e0 Ginette Dinis ( Dinis ), Agente des Ressources humaines et une employ\u00e9e de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Dinis est charg\u00e9e d'administrer la conduite du concours. La mise en candidature de Desrosiers comporte une lettre de couverture, son curriculum vitae, certains dipl\u00f4mes universitaires, ses r\u00e9sultats aux examens de connaissance de langue seconde ainsi que sa plus r\u00e9cente \u00e9valuation de rendement. Le 8 ao\u00fbt 1997, Dinis accuse r\u00e9ception de la candidature de Desrosiers par courrier \u00e9lectronique. Elle informe Desrosiers que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 examin[e] actuellement vos comp\u00e9tences et votre exp\u00e9rience se rapportant \u00e0 cette possibilit\u00e9 d'emploi. Nous communiquerons avec vous une fois que l'\u00e9tude des demandes pour ce poste sera termin\u00e9e. Le 8 ao\u00fbt 1997, Desrosiers et Dinis communiquent par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et discutent bri\u00e8vement du concours 97-RID-13. Durant cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 8 ao\u00fbt 1997, Desrosiers et Dinis discutent, entres autres, que le poste qui sera octroy\u00e9 suite au concours 97-RID-13 est un poste qui implique des t\u00e2ches dites sur appel ainsi que certains voyagements. Toujours durant la m\u00eame conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, Dinis informe Desrosiers qu'elle lui transmettra une copie de l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des qualit\u00e9s pour le concours 97-RID-13. Desrosiers re\u00e7oit l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des qualit\u00e9s requises de Dinis au courant du mois d'ao\u00fbt 1997. En date du 29 ao\u00fbt 1997, seulement quatre candidats postulent sur le concours. Parmi les quatre candidats, deux sont \u00e9limin\u00e9s et non retenus par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour le motif que les candidats n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de laquelle s'offre le poste convoit\u00e9. Suite \u00e0 l'\u00e9limination des deux candidats seuls deux candidats demeurent en liste pour le concours : Rod Magliocco et Desrosiers. La pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection des candidats pour le concours est confi\u00e9e \u00e0 Michelle Jammes ( Jammes ) par Dinis pendant les vacances annuelles de cette derni\u00e8re. Dans le cadre de son exercice de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, Jammes s'informe aupr\u00e8s des Services de sant\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des restrictions m\u00e9dicales et\/ou physiques particuli\u00e8res de Desrosiers.\nLe 2 septembre 1997, Jammes demande aux Services de sant\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de lui fournir des renseignements au sujet des restrictions m\u00e9dicales et\/ou physiques particuli\u00e8res de Desrosiers. De dire Jammes :\n[Traduction]\nJe dois obtenir d'urgence la liste des restrictions professionnelles de l'employ\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus [Martin Desrosiers]. On m'a dit qu'il est incapable de soulever des charges lourdes; toutefois, je ne sais pas ce que le milieu m\u00e9dical entend par charge lourde ou charge l\u00e9g\u00e8re . On me dit qu'il est incapable de rester debout ou assis longtemps. Cependant, je dois savoir ce qu'on entend par longtemps (nombre de minutes).\nLe dossier de cet employ\u00e9 se trouve \u00e0 Huron\/Rideau. Il faut que le Dr Belzile ou une infirmi\u00e8re en sant\u00e9 du travail m'informe par \u00e9crit de ses restrictions.\nM. Ramsay est en voie de doter un poste pour lequel M. Desrosiers a pos\u00e9 sa candidature. Afin de pouvoir terminer le processus de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, je dois d\u00e9terminer si M. Desrosiers serait apte physiquement \u00e0 occuper ce poste. M. Ramsay aimerait que les entrevues aient lieu ce vendredi 5 septembre.\nEst-ce que le Dr Belzile ou Mme Younger pourrait qualifier et quantifier les restrictions pour nos dossiers?\nToujours dans le cadre de son exercice de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection des candidats, Jammes demande au gestionnaire responsable du poste repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le concours 97-RID-13, de lui fournir une liste des t\u00e2ches physiques reli\u00e9es au poste devant \u00eatre combl\u00e9.\nLe 3 septembre 1997, le consultant \u009cuvrant aupr\u00e8s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les Services de sant\u00e9 communique \u00e0 Jammes une liste des limitations physiques de Desrosiers en date du 21 mai 1996. Cette liste faisait \u00e9tat des restrictions m\u00e9dicales et\/ou physiques suivantes :\n[Traduction]\n1. Changer de position toutes les 20 \u00e0 30 minutes;\n2. Rester debout pendant une courte p\u00e9riode (5-6 minutes);\n3. Soulever des charges de moins de 18 livres;\n4. Monter des escaliers \u00e0 l'occasion;\n5. Pousser ou tirer des chariots (r\u00e9sistance d'au plus 20 livres).\nLe 4 septembre 1997, Jammes informe Dinis qu'elle n'a pas retenu la candidature de Desrosiers pour le concours 97-RID-13, d\u00fb au fait qu'il est m\u00e9dicalement inapte \u00e0 assumer les t\u00e2ches reli\u00e9es \u00e0 ce poste vacant . Le 5 septembre, Rod Magliocco, \u00e9tant le seul candidat retenu suite au processus de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, d\u00e9bute l'examen des comp\u00e9tences tel que mandat\u00e9 par le processus d'embauche.\nLe 18 septembre 1997, Dinis informe Desrosiers par courriel que sa candidature pour le concours n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour le motif qu'il ne rencontre pas les exigences physiques du poste en vertu de ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales. Desrosiers d\u00e9pose un grief portant le num\u00e9ro 70810-AS-97-079 aupr\u00e8s de son Syndicat, lequel grief fut subs\u00e9quemment retir\u00e9 du processus de grief par le Syndicat en date du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1997.\nRod Magliocco r\u00e9ussit l'examen \u00e9crit avec un r\u00e9sultat de 92% et est offert le poste suite au concours 97-RID-13.\nIII. FAITS SUPPL\u00c9MENTAIRES PR\u00c9SENT\u00c9S \u00c0 L'AUDIENCE [5] Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 dans l'admissions de faits conjointes, Desrosiers a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 le 6 mai 1987. Le 12 janvier 1995, il a subi un accident de travail, une blessure au dos, qui le force \u00e0 s'absenter de son travail jusqu'au 19 mai 1996. Cette blessure a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, en ao\u00fbt 1995, une intervention chirurgicale qui fut pratiqu\u00e9e par le Dr Max Aebi, \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital Royal Victoria de Montr\u00e9al. Avant cet accident et l'intervention chirurgicale du Dr Aebi, Desrosiers avait subi deux autres chirurgies \u00e0 la colonne lombaire en 1987 et en 1992 (d\u00e9compression). De plus, en 1989, il avait subi une chirurgie \u00e0 la colonne cervicale (Clowards). Desrosiers a d\u00e9crit la derni\u00e8re intervention (fusion L4-S1), en 1995, de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\nEn fait, la fusion lombaire consistait d'abord \u00e0 mettre des espaces inter-vert\u00e9braux en titanium entre les vert\u00e8bres pour plus qu'il n'y ait d'affaissement entre les vert\u00e8bres; remplace donc les disques. Et ensuite, faire un genre de cage autour de la colonne - je sais pas exactement comment c'est fait - et mettre des tiges de titanium de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 avec six vis.\nIls ont pris des os de la hanche pour mettre \u00e7a autour pour calcifier le tout, pour que ce soit tr\u00e8s solide \u00e0 l'avenir. Et l'op\u00e9ration a r\u00e9ussi, et je m'en porte bien depuis ce temps-l\u00e0.\n[6] En f\u00e9vrier 1996, la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l'assurance contre les accidents du travail de l'Ontario d\u00e9crivait l'incapacit\u00e9 de Desrosiers comme permanente et comme lui imposant, entre autres, de ne pas lever des charges lourdes.\n[7] Desrosiers s'est absent\u00e9 du travail jusqu'au 19 mai 1996. Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 dans l'admissions de faits conjointes, pour faciliter sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration au travail, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 lui a demand\u00e9 de subir un test musculo-squelettique afin de conna\u00eetre ses limites fonctionnelles. Ce test fut administr\u00e9, le 17 mai 1996, par Lucie Labenski Blench, physioth\u00e9rapeute, de Movement Analysis and Treatment Centre. Le mandat donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Labenski Blench, tel que d\u00e9crit dans son rapport, \u00e9tait d'\u00e9valuer la capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle de Desrosiers afin de d\u00e9terminer ses capacit\u00e9s de travail de bureau et de consid\u00e9rer ses capacit\u00e9s de se pencher, d'\u00eatre assis, d'\u00eatre debout et de soulever des poids. De plus, il lui \u00e9tait demand\u00e9 de sugg\u00e9rer un programme d'endurance au travail.\n[8] Dans le sommaire de son rapport dat\u00e9 le 21 mai 1996, transmis \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Mme Labenski Blench conclut ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nR\u00c9SUM\u00c9\nM. Desrosiers est en mesure d'accomplir des fonctions s\u00e9dentaires et l\u00e9g\u00e8res. Il peut ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches normales que comporte cette cat\u00e9gorie d'emploi.\nSon poste de travail (chaise, pupitre, \u00e9cran, clavier, etc.) doit \u00eatre am\u00e9nag\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ergonomique. Il doit pouvoir :\nchanger de position toutes les 20 \u00e0 30 minutes; rester debout pendant une br\u00e8ve p\u00e9riode (5-6 minutes); soulever ou transporter des charges l\u00e9g\u00e8res (moins de 18 livres); monter des escaliers \u00e0 l'occasion; pousser ou tirer des chariots (r\u00e9sistance d'au plus 20 livres); ex\u00e9cuter des t\u00e2ches exigeant une extr\u00eame dext\u00e9rit\u00e9.\nAVIS\nM. Desrosiers semble motiv\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le travail afin d'exercer des fonctions s\u00e9dentaires et l\u00e9g\u00e8res.\nSa fonctionnalit\u00e9 potentielle pour un tel emploi semble suffisante \u00e0 ce moment-ci.\nSUGGESTIONS :\nSix semaines de r\u00e9entra\u00eenement \u00e0 l'effort pour am\u00e9liorer sa souplesse et son endurance. Exercice pendant dix semaines (dans un gymnase ou programme interne). Am\u00e9nagement ergonomique appropri\u00e9 du lieu de travail.\n[9] Ce rapport du Movement Analysis and Treatment Centre fut le dernier examen m\u00e9dical demand\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le cas de Desrosiers.\n[10] Les parties ont reconnu dans leurs admissions de faits conjointes que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a, en ao\u00fbt 1997, affich\u00e9 un concours pour un poste d'analyste de gestion, classifi\u00e9 au niveau CS-03. \u00c0 titre d'agente Ressources humaines pour la r\u00e9gion Huron\/Rideau, Dinis est responsable pour la dotation des postes vacants et elle est aussi responsable pour les employ\u00e9s qui sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s surplus ou exc\u00e9dentaires. Dans l'exercice de ses fonctions, elle fut responsable pour la r\u00e9daction de l'annonce du concours relativement au poste d'analyste de gestion.\n[11] L'annonce d\u00e9crit comme suit les fonctions du poste :\n\u00abPlanifie, coordonne et g\u00e8re les activit\u00e9s de soutien en t\u00e9l\u00e9communication, en micro-informatique, en syst\u00e8me de traitement du courrier, d'am\u00e9liorations et de contr\u00f4le de configuration reli\u00e9s aux syst\u00e8mes d'information, aux r\u00e9seaux de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication et aux syst\u00e8mes nationaux de tri de courrier. Assure la gestion des projets, fait le suivi des activit\u00e9s des int\u00e9grateurs de service et coordonne les changements. Pr\u00e9pare les d\u00e9finitions de besoins, les analyses vari\u00e9es pour des am\u00e9liorations aux \u00e9quipements. Agi \u00e0 titre de technicien, installe des \u00e9quipements. Agit \u00e0 titre de conseiller technique pour le gestionnaire et les clients (internes ou externes). Supervise un groupe de soutien, r\u00e9parti les t\u00e2ches, coordonne les activit\u00e9s de groupe, participe aux \u00e9valuations, r\u00e9dige les proc\u00e9dures, g\u00e8re les demandes de services et assure la formation. \u00bb\nPour leur part, les conditions de candidature \u00e9taient les suivantes :\n\u00ab- Le bilinguisme est imp\u00e9ratif.\n- Dipl\u00f4me universitaire ou coll\u00e9gial dans le domaine informatique, \u00e9lectrique ou t\u00e9l\u00e9communication ou un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes secondaires jumel\u00e9 avec un minimum de 5 ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience dans ces domaines.\n- Tr\u00e8s bonne exp\u00e9rience des r\u00e9seaux de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication (voix et donn\u00e9es) et des micro-ordinateurs reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la conception, \u00e0 l'installation aux essais, au soutien et \u00e0 l'entretien des \u00e9quipements et logiciels. \u00bb\n[12] L'annonce pr\u00e9voyait \u00e9galement que les candidats devaient d\u00e9montrer qu'ils satisfont aux exigences mentionn\u00e9es.\n[13] Selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, l'Analyste de gestion doit assumer toutes les t\u00e2ches de technicien comprenant, entre autres, de d\u00e9placer des fili\u00e8res ou des bureaux de travail pour avoir acc\u00e8s aux c\u00e2bles ou aux prises de courant; de d\u00e9placer des cabinets de communication; de d\u00e9placer des contr\u00f4leurs de r\u00e9seau; de d\u00e9placer et replacer des tuiles du plancher de la salle d'ordinateur; de d\u00e9placer et transporter des bo\u00eetes contenant des t\u00e9l\u00e9phones, des modems et des c\u00e2bles. Il doit \u00e9galement lever et installer de l'\u00e9quipement qui peut peser entre 60 et 70 livres.\n[14] Dans leur r\u00e9futation, Desrosiers et la Commission argumentent, pour leur part, que rien dans l'annonce du poste n'indique express\u00e9ment qu'il y a des exigences physiques attach\u00e9es \u00e0 ce poste. Ils mentionnent \u00e9galement que l'annonce d\u00e9crit une quinzaine de fonctions et que la seule qui pourrait, de mani\u00e8re implicite, demander des exigences physiques serait celle qui pr\u00e9voit que le titulaire agit \u00e0 titre de technicien, installe des \u00e9quipements . Les autres fonctions font, \u00e0 leur avis, plut\u00f4t appel \u00e0 des exigences de nature intellectuelles, conclusion avec laquelle Dinis s'est dite d'accord. Ils ajoutent \u00e9galement que rien dans l'annonce n'exige que le candidat puisse d\u00e9placer des classeurs, des cabinets de communication ou des tuiles de plancher.\n[15] Rod Magliocco, l'Analyste de gestion actuel qui occupe le poste depuis qu'il a gagn\u00e9 le concours en septembre 1997, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en ce qui a trait aux t\u00e2ches du poste. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, un analyste de gestion a pour responsabilit\u00e9 de g\u00e9rer, de maintenir et de conseiller les utilisateurs des r\u00e9seaux de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication (voix et donn\u00e9es). Il est \u00e9galement responsable pour la coordination et la gestion des activit\u00e9s de soutien en t\u00e9l\u00e9communication, en syst\u00e8me de traitement de courrier, d'am\u00e9lioration et de contr\u00f4le de configuration reli\u00e9s aux syst\u00e8mes d'information, aux r\u00e9seaux de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication et aux syst\u00e8mes nationaux de tri de courrier pour la r\u00e9gion Rideau. Cette r\u00e9gion s'\u00e9tend au nord jusqu'\u00e0 Petawawa, \u00e0 l'est jusqu'\u00e0 Cornwall, comprenant la Vall\u00e9e d'Ottawa et la r\u00e9gion de Hull et Gatineau, et au sud, jusqu'\u00e0 Brockville, Kingston, Belleville et Peterborough. Les d\u00e9placements peuvent dans certains cas prendre plus de 3 heures. L'analyste de gestion est souvent appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9panner les personnes qui ont des probl\u00e8mes avec leurs ordinateurs, imprimantes, t\u00e9l\u00e9copieurs ou lignes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. Dans ses diff\u00e9rentes t\u00e2ches, il peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9placer de l'\u00e9quipement ou des meubles qui p\u00e8sent plus de 18 livres. Il avoue toutefois que des d\u00e9m\u00e9nageurs peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s dans certains cas et qu'il existe ce qu'il a appel\u00e9 des Service Level Agreement par lesquels les nouveaux \u00e9quipements sont install\u00e9s par le fournisseur.\n[16] Desrosiers soumet sa candidature le 7 ao\u00fbt 1997 \u00e0 Dinis, soit quelques semaines avant la date limite pour la soumission de candidatures qui \u00e9tait fix\u00e9e au 29 ao\u00fbt 1997.\n[17] Le 8 ao\u00fbt 1997, Desrosiers et Dinis ont une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique dans laquelle ils discutent bri\u00e8vement du concours, des exigences du poste en terme d'heures de travail ainsi que des exigences de d\u00e9placement. Desrosiers aurait \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 qu'on lui fasse parvenir la description d'emploi pour le poste ainsi que l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des qualit\u00e9s. Il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question lors de cette conversation de la situation de famille de Desrosiers.\n[18] Durant les vacances annuelles de Dinis, la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection des candidats est confi\u00e9e \u00e0 Jammes, Agente de ressources humaines \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s la date limite pr\u00e9vue dans l'annonce pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des candidatures, Jammes d\u00e9bute le processus pr\u00e9liminaire de s\u00e9lection. Ce processus consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer quels candidats, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, seront accept\u00e9s dans le processus de concours. Pour ce faire, elle doit se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer entres autres aux exigences de la Convention collective ainsi qu'aux directives du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor en mati\u00e8re de dotation du personnel. Les directives du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00e9noncent, entre autres, que l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 constitue l'une des conditions d'emploi qui doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et \u00eatre satisfaites avant la nomination.\n[19] Ainsi, dans le cadre de ce processus de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, elle dit s'\u00eatre inform\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s des services de sant\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des limitations particuli\u00e8res de Desrosiers. Le 3 septembre 1997, le Dr Robert Belzile, du service de sant\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, informait Jammes des restrictions physiques de Desrosiers. Dans sa note, le Dr Belzile reprenait essentiellement les conclusions du rapport du 21 mai 1996 de Movement Analysis and Treatment Centre, lequel indiquait que Desrosiers ne pouvait lever des objets de plus de 18 livres, qu'il devait changer de position toutes les 20-30 minutes et qu'il ne pouvait rester debout que pour de br\u00e8ves p\u00e9riodes de 5-6 minutes.\n[20] Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception de cette information, Jammes, tout en tenant compte des exigences du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et des exigences physiques du poste, en est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que Desrosiers ne pourrait assumer les t\u00e2ches du poste d'Analyste de gestion. En cons\u00e9quence, Jammes a donc \u00e9limin\u00e9 la candidature de Desrosiers.\n[21] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d'accommodement pour Desrosiers, elle avoue qu'elle n'a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cette possibilit\u00e9 que tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s bri\u00e8vement . \u00c0 son avis, l'accommodement aurait n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 dans ce cas qu'un autre employ\u00e9 accompagne constamment Desrosiers et plus sp\u00e9cialement lors de ses d\u00e9placements ce qui \u00e9tait, selon elle, impossible. Lorsque contre-interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet, Jammes avait ceci \u00e0 dire :\n[Traduction]\nQ. Vous avez indiqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t aujourd'hui que vous aviez bri\u00e8vement examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d'un accommodement pour M. Desrosiers?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Avez-vous r\u00e9dig\u00e9 des notes indiquant quelles mesures vous avez envisag\u00e9es comme possibilit\u00e9s d'accommodement pour M. Desrosiers ?\nR. Non, quand je dis bri\u00e8vement , je veux dire que la pens\u00e9e m'a effleur\u00e9 l'esprit. Essentiellement, cela signifie que j'ai r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi bri\u00e8vement \u00e0 ce que je pouvais faire, aux dispositifs d'aide qui pourraient exister. Je n'en connais aucun. Bien s\u00fbr, comme je l'ai dit dans mon t\u00e9moignage en interrogation principal, j'ai examin\u00e9 ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et j'ai pris ma d\u00e9cision en me basant l\u00e0-dessus.\nPour ce qui est des autres possibilit\u00e9s d'accommodement, je n'ai song\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune.\nQ. Est-ce que vous avez demand\u00e9 une analyse des cons\u00e9quences financi\u00e8res de l'embauche d'un autre employ\u00e9?\nR. Non, ce n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 moi \u00e0 faire cela.\nQ. Si on fait exception du bref moment de r\u00e9flexion, du moment o\u00f9 la pens\u00e9e vous a effleur\u00e9 l'esprit, pour reprendre les mots que vous avez employ\u00e9s, avez-vous en fait envisag\u00e9 autre chose?\nR. Non, autant que je sache, rien d'autre.\n[22] Desrosiers all\u00e8gue finalement qu'il a eu une autre conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, le 18 septembre 1997, avec Dinis lors de laquelle elle l'aurait inform\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu pour le concours, entre autres, parce que le poste d'Analyste de gestion s'accordait mal \u00e0 ses obligations familiales puisque le titulaire serait tenu de travailler en soir\u00e9e. Dinis nie avoir eu cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec Desrosiers ou d'avoir, \u00e0 aucun moment, discut\u00e9 avec lui de sa situation de famille.\nIV. QUESTIONS DE DROIT [23] Les questions de droit soumises au tribunal par les parties sont les suivantes :\nLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a-t-elle fait preuve d'un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e0 l'endroit de Desrosiers en rejetant sa candidature au poste d'Analyste de gestion en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience ou la perception d'une d\u00e9ficience (blessure au dos) ou de sa situation de famille, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6 ? Si le Tribunal r\u00e9pond dans l'affirmative \u00e0 la question pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, a-t-elle d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le rejet de la candidature de Desrosiers s'explique par une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de la jurisprudence et\/ou la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6 ?\nV. LE CADRE JURIDIQUE [24] Desrosiers a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 l'encontre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L'article 7 dispose que le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Lors de la p\u00e9riode pertinente, certaines pratiques n'\u00e9taient pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme discriminatoires aux termes de l'article 15 de la Loi. Le paragraphe 15a) pr\u00e9voyait que les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l'employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu'ils d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ne constituaient pas des actes discriminatoires.\n[25] Depuis les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour supr\u00eame dans les arr\u00eats Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 [appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement Meiorin ] et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 [appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement Grismer ], la distinction classique entre la discrimination directe et la discrimination indirecte fait place \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode unifi\u00e9e de traitement des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. Selon cette m\u00e9thode, il incombe d'abord \u00e0 la partie plaignante d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[26] Une fois qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il revient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la politique ou norme discriminatoire comporte un motif justifiable. Dans cette optique, la partie intim\u00e9e doit prouver :\nqu'elle a adopt\u00e9e la norme \u00e0 une fin ou dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, l'analyse porte non pas sur la validit\u00e9 de la norme particuli\u00e8re en cause, mais plut\u00f4t sur la validit\u00e9 de son objet plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, par exemple la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter la t\u00e2che de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace. Si l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est d'assurer l'ex\u00e9cution de la t\u00e2che de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace, il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire de consacrer beaucoup de temps \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape. qu'elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme en question en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail, et sans qu'elle ait eu l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le demandeur. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, l'analyse passe de l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme \u00e0 la norme elle-m\u00eame. que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but poursuivi, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'ex\u00e9cution de la t\u00e2che de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace. L'employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il ne peut composer avec le demandeur et les autres personnes touch\u00e9es par la norme sans subir une contrainte excessive. Il doit veiller \u00e0 ce que la proc\u00e9dure, s'il en est, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9tudier la question de l'accommodement tienne compte de la possibilit\u00e9 qu'elle puisse \u00eatre ind\u00fbment discriminatoire pour un motif de distinction illicite. En outre, la teneur r\u00e9elle d'une norme plus conciliante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte par l'employeur doit \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque cas. Subsidiairement, l'employeur doit justifier pourquoi il n'a pas offert une telle norme.\n[27] Les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer comportent des param\u00e8tres qui permettent de d\u00e9terminer si une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une contrainte excessive a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Dans Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame fait observer que l'utilisation du mot excessive laisse supposer qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable. Pour satisfaire \u00e0 la norme, il faut absolument que la contrainte impos\u00e9e soit excessive . Il peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al, du point de vue de l'employeur de choisir une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue. Encore est-il que, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, cette norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive.\n[28] La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement fait remarquer que l'intim\u00e9e, afin de prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, a toujours la charge de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle inclut toute possibilit\u00e9 d'accommodement sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. [Voir Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 32.] Il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'\u00e9tablir qu'il a examin\u00e9 et raisonnablement rejet\u00e9 toutes les formes viables d'accommodement. L'intim\u00e9e doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il \u00e9tait impossible d'incorporer dans la norme des aspects d'accommodement individuels sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. [Voir Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 42.] Dans certains cas, le co\u00fbt excessif peut justifier le refus de composer avec les personnes atteintes de d\u00e9ficiences. Toutefois, il faut se garder de ne pas accorder suffisamment d'importance \u00e0 l'accommodement de la personne handicap\u00e9e. Il est beaucoup trop facile d'invoquer l'augmentation des co\u00fbts pour justifier le refus d'accorder un traitement \u00e9gal aux personnes handicap\u00e9es. [Voir Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 41.] L'adoption de la norme de l'intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve convaincants. La preuve, selon Meiorin et Grismer, qui serait constitu\u00e9e d'impressions, d'une augmentation des d\u00e9penses ne suffit pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement. [Voir Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 41 et 42.] On devrait songer \u00e0 des moyens d'accommodement innovateurs et non p\u00e9cuniaires pratiques. Enfin, les facteurs tels que le co\u00fbt des m\u00e9thodes d'accommodement possibles devraient \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re souple et conforme au bon sens, en fonction des faits de chaque cas. [Voir Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 63.]\n[29] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'application des arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer, rendus post\u00e9rieurement aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements en l'esp\u00e8ce, pour d\u00e9terminer si la norme appliqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, je tiens \u00e0 rappeler que l'un des principes fondamentaux de notre syst\u00e8me de droit veut que la common law s'applique toujours \u00e0 tous les \u00e9v\u00e9nements ant\u00e9rieurs, \u00e0 compter du moment o\u00f9 les r\u00e8gles sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es. [Voir Irvine c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [2001] D.C.D.P. No. 39, par. 120]\nVI. L'ANALYSE a) Le plaignant a-t-il pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve prima facie de discrimination en contravention de l'article 7 ? i) Discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille [30] \u00c0 mon avis, Desrosiers ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9 de sa charge initiale de preuve et il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que l'intim\u00e9e avait commis \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille. Selon Desrosiers, il aurait eu une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, le 18 septembre 1997, avec Dinis et lors de celle-ci elle l'aurait inform\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu pour le concours. Il all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement qu'elle l'aurait alors inform\u00e9 que le poste d'Analyste de gestion s'accordait mal \u00e0 ses obligations familiales parce que le titulaire serait tenu de travailler en soir\u00e9e. Dinis nie avoir eu cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec Desrosiers ou d'avoir, \u00e0 aucun moment, discut\u00e9 avec lui de sa situation de famille. Dans les admissions de faits conjointes, il est fait mention que le 18 septembre 1997, Dinis a bel et bien inform\u00e9 Desrosiers mais par courriel que sa candidature pour le concours n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour le motif qu'il ne rencontre pas les exigences physiques du poste en vertu de ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales. Il n'y est aucunement fait mention de sa situation de famille.\n[31] Il se peut tr\u00e8s bien qu'\u00e0 un moment ou un autre la situation de famille de Desrosiers ait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard aux exigences du poste lesquelles n\u00e9cessitaient que le postulant soit en appel et qu'il se d\u00e9place. Toutefois, je ne suis pas convaincu que cette question ait influenc\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e d'attribuer ou non le poste \u00e0 Desrosiers.\nii) Discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience [32] Le paragraphe 3(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit :\nPour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9es sur [ ] ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n[33] Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu que l'article 7 dispose que le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et que le paragraphe 15a) pr\u00e9voyait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque pertinente que les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l'employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu'ils d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ne constituaient pas des actes discriminatoires. Pour sa part, l'article 25 de la Loi d\u00e9finit d\u00e9ficience comme une d\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu'elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e.\n[34] Ainsi une d\u00e9ficience peut r\u00e9sulter aussi bien d'une limitation physique que d'une perception de limitation ou d'une combinaison des deux. [Voir Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J. c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665, par. 79.] Le tribunal doit donc dans sa d\u00e9termination de la question \u00e0 savoir s'il existe ou non une d\u00e9ficience tenir compte non seulement de la situation m\u00e9dicale du plaignant mais aussi des circonstances dans lesquelles une distinction est faite. En d'autres mots, dans le cadre de l'acte reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 un employeur, le tribunal doit se demander, entre autres, si une affectation r\u00e9elle ou per\u00e7ue engendre pour le plaignant la perte ou la diminution des possibilit\u00e9s de participer \u00e0 la vie collective au m\u00eame titre que les autres. [Voir Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J. c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 80.]\n[35] Dans la plupart des cas, il incombera au plaignant de prouver (1) l'existence d'une distinction, exclusion ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence (2) que la distinction, exclusion ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence est fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9e dans la Loi et (3) que la distinction, exclusion ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence a pour effet de d\u00e9truire ou compromettre le droit \u00e0 l'exercice, en pleine \u00e9galit\u00e9, des droits de la personne. [Voir Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J. c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 84.]\n[36] Il est important de rappeler qu'il n'incombe, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape, pour la partie plaignante que d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination c'est-\u00e0-dire une preuve qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[37] En l'esp\u00e8ce, je suis convaincu qu'il existe une preuve prima facie d'une distinction fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience physique r\u00e9elle ou per\u00e7ue dans le traitement qu'a subi Desrosiers lors de sa candidature pour le poste. Je suis \u00e9galement d'opinion que son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, en l'esp\u00e8ce son mal de dos, peut constituer une d\u00e9ficience et constituer un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite au sens de la Loi. [Voir Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J. c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 82.] Il est \u00e9galement clair que cette distinction dans le traitement de Desrosiers a eu pour effet de le priver de l'opportunit\u00e9 de participer pleinement au concours pour le poste.\n[38] Cette conclusion est d'ailleurs fortement appuy\u00e9e par les faits. Je me r\u00e9f\u00e8re notamment aux admissions de faits conjointes o\u00f9 les parties ont admis que la candidature de Desrosiers n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue d\u00fb au fait qu'il est m\u00e9dicalement inapte \u00e0 assumer les t\u00e2ches reli\u00e9es \u00e0 ce poste vacant. Je me r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e9galement \u00e0 un courriel de Jammes en date du 4 septembre 1997 dans lequel elle affirme J'ai rejet\u00e9 la candidature de M. Desrosiers pour ce concours au stade de la pr\u00e9selection d\u00fb au fait qu'il est m\u00e9dicalement inapte \u00e0 assumer les t\u00e2ches reli\u00e9es \u00e0 ce poste vacant.\n[39] Une preuve prima facie de discrimination ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il revient maintenant \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de d\u00e9montrer, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu'elle d\u00e9coule d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es. Pour d\u00e9cider si la partie intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 rencontrer le fardeau de la preuve qui lui incombe, je me propose de suivre la m\u00e9thode en trois \u00e9tapes propos\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame dans les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer.\n[40] Dans son argumentation orale, l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e, pour appuyer son argument \u00e0 l'effet que la Commission et le plaignant n'ont pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, s'est fond\u00e9e sur trois d\u00e9cisions rendues avant les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer, soit les d\u00e9cisions Rivard c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [1990] D.C.D.P. No 5; Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes) c. Bouchard, [1991] D.C.D.P. No 14; et, Boivin c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, [1994] D.C.D.P. No 2. Avec tout le respect que je dois aux membres du tribunal qui ont si\u00e9g\u00e9 dans ces affaires, je ne crois pas que celles-ci soient pertinentes, eu \u00e9gard, \u00e0 la nouvelle approche sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame.\n[41] Je me dois maintenant de poursuivre mon analyse en d\u00e9terminant si cette discrimination \u00e9tablie selon une preuve prima facie d\u00e9coule d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\nb) La discrimination d\u00e9coule-t-elle d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (EPJ)? i) La norme a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause ? [42] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e0 franchir pour \u00e9valuer si l'employeur a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une d\u00e9fense d'EPJ consiste \u00e0 identifier l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme contest\u00e9e et \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s'il est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail. Il faut donc d\u00e9terminer ce que vise \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale la norme contest\u00e9e. La capacit\u00e9 de travailler de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace est l'objet le plus fr\u00e9quemment mentionn\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence. [Voir Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 57.] L'employeur doit d\u00e9montrer l'existence d'un lien rationnel entre l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme contest\u00e9e et les exigences objectives du travail. Lorsque l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme est d'assumer l'ex\u00e9cution s\u00fbre et efficace du travail il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire de consacrer beaucoup de temps \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape. [Voir Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 58.] \u00c0 cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, l'analyse porte non pas sur la validit\u00e9 de la norme particuli\u00e8re en cause, mais plut\u00f4t sur la validit\u00e9 de son objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[43] La norme en l'instance est celle que nous retrouvons dans un document du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor intitul\u00e9 Renseignement sur la dotation et qui \u00e9nonce:\nL'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, la fiabilit\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 constituent des conditions d'emploi qui doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et \u00eatre satisfaites avant la nomination.\n[44] Selon la Commission, la norme en cause n'est pas rationnellement li\u00e9e au processus de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection des candidats pour des emplois. Je ne peux souscrire \u00e0 cette conclusion. \u00c0 mon avis, la seule question pertinente \u00e0 ce stade est de savoir si l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme est valide. Cet objet est de permettre \u00e0 l'employeur de d\u00e9celer les employ\u00e9s ou postulants qui ne sont pas en mesure d'effectuer le travail de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace. En l'esp\u00e8ce, les conditions de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 garantissent l'objectif d'une ex\u00e9cution s\u00fbre du travail alors que la fiabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9pondra \u00e0 l'objectif d'efficacit\u00e9. J'en conclus qu'il existe un lien rationnel \u00e9vident entre la norme et l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause.\nii) La norme a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par l'employeur en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail, et sans qu'il ait eu l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le plaignant. [45] Dans Meiorin, Madame la juge McLachlin explique comme suit la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de cette approche :\nUne fois \u00e9tablie la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l'objet plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral vis\u00e9 par l'employeur, ce dernier doit franchir la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape qui consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de son objet, et sans qu'il ait eu l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le demandeur. Il est alors question de l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment subjectif du crit\u00e8re qui constitue un motif d'annulation de la norme m\u00eame s'il n'est pas essentiel pour conclure que cette derni\u00e8re n'est pas une EPJ. Si l'imposition de la norme n'\u00e9tait pas jug\u00e9e raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire ou \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par une animosit\u00e9 discriminatoire, elle ne saurait alors constituer une EPJ. [Voir Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 60.]\n[46] Contrairement \u00e0 ce que la Commission argumente, rien, en l'esp\u00e8ce, n'indique que l'employeur n'ait pas agi honn\u00eatement et en croyant sinc\u00e8rement que l'adoption de la norme particuli\u00e8re \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9celer les personnes qui ne seraient pas en mesure d'ex\u00e9cuter le travail de fa\u00e7on s\u00fbre et efficace. En adoptant cette norme, l'intim\u00e9e n'avait aucunement l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers Desrosiers.\niii) La norme contest\u00e9e est-elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but poursuivi [47] Pour d\u00e9montrer que la norme \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but vis\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire d\u00e9celer les employ\u00e9s ou postulants qui ne sont pas en mesure d'effectuer le travail de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 doit prouver qu'il lui \u00e9tait impossible de composer avec Desrosiers ou d'autres employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9sentant les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques, sans qu'il n'en r\u00e9sulte pour elle une contrainte excessive.\n[48] En ce qui a trait au concept de contrainte excessive, la Cour supr\u00eame s'exprime ainsi \u00e0 ce sujet :\nLorsqu'on parle de contrainte excessive , il importe de se rappeler les propos du juge Sopinka, qui a fait remarquer dans l'arr\u00eat Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, \u00e0 la p. 984 que [l]'utilisation de l'adjectif excessive suppose qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable; seule la contrainte excessive r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re . Il peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al, du point de vue de l'employeur, de choisir une norme de rigidit\u00e9 absolue. Encore est-il que, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, cette norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive.\n[Voir Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 62.]\n[49] Lorsque la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en 1998, le paragraphe 15(2) a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9. Selon ce paragraphe, les co\u00fbts, la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont des facteurs dont l'employeur peut tenir compte pour d\u00e9terminer si composer avec une personne lui imposerait une contrainte excessive. Cependant, les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte sont survenus avant l'adoption de cette modification; comme on l'a fait remarquer dans Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, 2003 TCDP 2, je dois donc examiner la question de l'accommodement non au regard du nouveau paragraphe 15(2) mais plut\u00f4t au regard des principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Central Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 489, aux pages 520 et 521 :\nJe ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9finir de fa\u00e7on exhaustive ce qu'il faut entendre par contrainte excessive mais j'estime qu'il peut \u00eatre utile d'\u00e9num\u00e9rer certains facteurs permettant de l'appr\u00e9cier. J'adopte d'abord \u00e0 cette fin les facteurs identifi\u00e9s par la commission d'enqu\u00eate en l'esp\u00e8ce - le co\u00fbt financier, l'atteinte \u00e0 la convention collective, le moral du personnel et l'interchangeabilit\u00e9 des effectifs et des installations. L'importance de l'exploitation de l'employeur peut jouer sur l'\u00e9valuation de ce qui repr\u00e9sente un co\u00fbt excessif ou sur la facilit\u00e9 avec laquelle les effectifs et les installations peuvent s'adapter aux circonstances. Lorsque la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est en jeux, l'ampleur du risque et l'identit\u00e9 de ceux qui le supportent sont des facteurs pertinents. Cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration ne se veut pas exhaustive et les r\u00e9sultats qu'on obtiendra en mesurant ces facteurs par rapport au droit de l'employ\u00e9 de ne pas faire l'objet de discrimination varieront n\u00e9cessairement selon les cas.\n[50] Il existe, comme nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, des param\u00e8tres qui permettent de d\u00e9terminer si une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une contrainte excessive a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. L'utilisation du mot excessive laisse \u00e9videmment supposer qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable. Pour satisfaire \u00e0 la norme, il faut absolument que la contrainte impos\u00e9e soit excessive . Pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, la norme choisie par l'employeur doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive.\n[51] L'intim\u00e9e, afin de prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, a la charge de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle inclut toute possibilit\u00e9 d'accommodement. Elle devra \u00e9tablir qu'elle a examin\u00e9 et raisonnablement rejet\u00e9 toutes les formes viables d'accommodement et qu'il est impossible d'incorporer dans la norme des aspects d'accommodement individuels sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. Dans certains cas, le co\u00fbt excessif peut justifier le refus de composer avec les personnes atteintes de d\u00e9ficiences. Toutefois, il faut se garder de ne pas accorder suffisamment d'importance \u00e0 l'accommodement de la personne handicap\u00e9e. Il est beaucoup trop facile d'invoquer l'augmentation des co\u00fbts pour justifier le refus d'accorder un traitement \u00e9gal aux personnes handicap\u00e9es. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur lesquels s'appuiera l'intim\u00e9e devront \u00eatre convaincants. La preuve constitu\u00e9e d'impressions ne suffira pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement.\n[52] Selon la Commission et le plaignant, pour d\u00e9terminer s'il existe en l'esp\u00e8ce une contrainte excessive le tribunal devrait s'inspirer de l'approche propos\u00e9e par Madame la juge McLachlin dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin. En effet, dans cette d\u00e9cision elle soulignait qu'outre les \u00e9valuations individuelles visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la personne a les aptitudes ou les comp\u00e9tences requises pour ex\u00e9cuter le travail, il y a lieu \u00e9galement de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la possibilit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter le travail de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res tout en r\u00e9alisant l'objet l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi. [Voir Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 64.]\n[53] Abordons la question de l'\u00e9valuation individuelle de Desrosiers afin de d\u00e9terminer s'il avait les aptitudes ou les comp\u00e9tences requises pour ex\u00e9cuter le travail. Le t\u00e9moignage de Jammes lors de l'audience est qu'elle a examin\u00e9 les exigences physiques pour le poste et les a \u00e9valu\u00e9es contre les limites physiques de Desrosiers, telles que relat\u00e9es par le Dr Belzile, des services de sant\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Le Dr Robert Belzile, en se fondant sur les conclusions d'un rapport fait quelques 15 mois auparavant par le Movement Analysis and Treatment Centre, concluait que Desrosiers ne pouvait lever des objets de plus de 18 livres, qu'il devait changer de position toutes les 20-30 minutes et qu'il ne pouvait rester debout que pour de br\u00e8ves p\u00e9riodes de 5-6 minutes. Le Dr Belzile ne fut pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[54] Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception de cette information, Jammes en est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que Desrosiers ne pourrait assumer les t\u00e2ches du poste d'Analyste de gestion. En cons\u00e9quence, elle a \u00e9limin\u00e9 la candidature de Desrosiers.\n[55] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve le t\u00e9moignage de Rod Magliocco, l'Analyste de gestion actuel qui occupe le poste depuis qu'il a gagn\u00e9 le concours en septembre 1997. M. Magliocco a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en ce qui a trait aux t\u00e2ches du poste. Son t\u00e9moignage portait sur les t\u00e2ches du poste telles qu'elles existaient en 1997 et telles qu'elles ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 depuis. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve une preuve d'expertise de Jeff Pajot, ergonomiste et pr\u00e9sident de Pajot Ergonomic, qui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 deux rapports. Le premier intitul\u00e9 Analyse des exigences physiques. Gestion des donn\u00e9es, analyste-programmeur-Gestion des syst\u00e8mes d'ordinateurs (CS3) fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2002. Dans ce rapport, M. Pajot indique qu'il a effectu\u00e9, le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2002, une analyse ergonomique du poste d'analyste-programmeur. Il indique \u00e9galement que les donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es dans son analyse sont tir\u00e9es d'observation au travail et d'une entrevue avec M. Rod Magliocco. Le deuxi\u00e8me rapport intitul\u00e9 \u00c9valuation du poste CS3 \u00e0 Postes Canada par rapport aux qualit\u00e9s personnelles de Martin Desrosiers fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le 13 janvier 2003. Dans ce rapport, M. Pajot dit avoir effectu\u00e9 une analyse du poste pour voir s'il convenait \u00e0 Desrosiers. Cette analyse ergonomique effectu\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 2002 se fonde sur les conclusions contenues dans le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent rapport. M. Pajot n'a jamais rencontr\u00e9 Desrosiers.\n[56] J'accorde que peu de poids au t\u00e9moignage de M. Magliocco et aux rapports de M. Pajot. Au moment de d\u00e9terminer si la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 s'est acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation d'accommoder Desrosiers, la question pertinente est la suivante : au moment de d\u00e9cider de ne pas attribuer le poste \u00e0 Desrosiers en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a-t-elle fait les recherches n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9terminer la nature de son incapacit\u00e9, quel \u00e9tait son pronostic, quels accommodements pourraient \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires. [Conte c. Rogers Cablesystem Ltd., [1999] D.C.D.P. No. 4, par. 81.] Dans le cas de M. Magliocco, celui-ci a essentiellement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 quant aux t\u00e2ches actuelles du poste. Pour leur part, les rapports de M. Pajot sont une tentative, avec cinq ans de retard, de justifier une d\u00e9cision. La pertinence d'une telle preuve, dans le contexte des droits de la personne, est douteuse. Je dois consid\u00e9rer la preuve telle qu'elle \u00e9tait en 1997 et non cinq ans apr\u00e8s. D'ailleurs, j'ai plut\u00f4t l'impression que cette \u00e9tude ergonomique a pour objet de justifier, apr\u00e8s coup, la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e de refuser le poste \u00e0 Desrosiers en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[57] Malgr\u00e9 la faiblesse de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, je conclus n\u00e9anmoins qu'en 1997, Desrosiers pr\u00e9sentait des limitations dans ses aptitudes physiques pour accomplir les t\u00e2ches du poste. La blessure au dos subie par Desrosiers, en ao\u00fbt 1995, avait n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 une importante intervention chirurgicale. En f\u00e9vrier 1996, la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l'assurance contre les accidents du travail de l'Ontario d\u00e9crivait l'incapacit\u00e9 de Desrosiers comme permanente et comme lui imposant, entre autres, de ne pas lever des charges lourdes. La seule question que nous devons consid\u00e9rer en l'esp\u00e8ce est de savoir si l'intim\u00e9e a examin\u00e9 et raisonnablement rejet\u00e9 toutes les formes viables d'accommodement pour Desrosiers sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte pour elle une contrainte excessive.\n[58] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la seule preuve relative \u00e0 une recherche d'accommodement fut celle de Jammes. Elle admet avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 bri\u00e8vement ( [Traduction] pens\u00e9e m'a effleur\u00e9 l'esprit ) la question d'un accommodement pour Desrosiers eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience. Selon elle, le seul accommodement possible \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les restrictions de Desrosiers aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'un autre employ\u00e9 accompagne Desrosiers dans l'accomplissement de ses t\u00e2ches notamment lors de ses d\u00e9placements. En 1997, selon son t\u00e9moignage, il n'y avait qu'un autre poste classifi\u00e9 CS-02 et d'exiger que cet employ\u00e9 accompagne Desrosiers dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches aurait ouvert la porte \u00e0 un grief de la part de cet employ\u00e9 au motif que s'il devait ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches d'un CS-03 alors il devrait \u00eatre pay\u00e9 au tarif horaire d'un CS-03. Selon la convention collective, cela aurait eu pour cons\u00e9quence que le CS-02 aurait eu droit \u00e0 une augmentation de salaire d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 9 000 $. Cr\u00e9er un autre poste de CS-02, pour remplacer l'employ\u00e9 qui devrait dor\u00e9navant accompagner Desrosiers aurait forc\u00e9 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 encourir des frais de salaire suppl\u00e9mentaire de 44 530 $. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9galement d'opinion que Desrosiers \u00e9tait actuellement accommod\u00e9 dans sa position AS-03 et qu'elle ne contrevenait donc \u00e0 aucun manquement.\n[59] En contre-interrogatoire Jammes a reconnu n'avoir pris aucune note concernant les possibilit\u00e9s d'accommodement pour Desrosiers. Elle admet \u00e9galement n'avoir jamais demand\u00e9 pour une analyse financi\u00e8re concernant la possibilit\u00e9 d'embaucher un autre employ\u00e9 pour assister Desrosiers.\n[60] L'intim\u00e9e, afin de prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire a, comme je l'ai indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle inclut toute possibilit\u00e9 d'accommodement sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. Il incombe donc \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'\u00e9tablir qu'il a examin\u00e9 et raisonnablement rejet\u00e9 toutes les formes viables d'accommodement, ce qu'il n'a \u00e9videmment pas fait en l'esp\u00e8ce. Les co\u00fbts excessifs peuvent justifier le refus de composer avec une personne atteinte de d\u00e9ficience mais de l'avis de Jammes il n'y eu en l'esp\u00e8ce aucune analyse financi\u00e8re concernant Desrosiers.\n[61] Dans son argument final, l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour divisionnaire de l'Ontario dans l'arr\u00eat Ontario (Human Rights Commission) c. Roosma, [2002] O.J. No. 3688 et, notamment, au paragraphe 89 de cette d\u00e9cision o\u00f9 la cour d\u00e9clare:\n[Traduction]\n[ ], je crois que la d\u00e9marche suivie par la compagnie pour examiner la demande d'accommodement \u00e9tait suffisante. Les circonstances contraignantes auxquelles la compagnie \u00e9tait confront\u00e9e \u00e9taient suffisamment \u00e9videntes; il n'\u00e9tait donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d'examiner en d\u00e9tail les possibilit\u00e9s d'accommodement.\n[62] Je tiens toutefois \u00e0 souligner que dans l'arr\u00eat Roosma il y avait eu un v\u00e9ritable effort d'accommodement de la part de l'employeur. En effet, la preuve d\u00e9montre qu'il y avait eu de 8 \u00e0 10 rencontres entre l'employeur et les employ\u00e9s concern\u00e9s pour discuter d'accommodement. Diff\u00e9rents sc\u00e9narios d'accommodement avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s et que finalement se sont les employ\u00e9s qui se sont retir\u00e9s de ces rencontres. En l'esp\u00e8ce, il n'y a jamais eu de v\u00e9ritable ou s\u00e9rieuse r\u00e9flexion quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d'accommodement.\n[63] En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d'avis que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9montrer en l'esp\u00e8ce qu'il existait une contrainte excessive ni qu'il s'agissait d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. D'ailleurs en appui de cette conclusion, nous nous r\u00e9f\u00e9rons au courriel, dat\u00e9 du 9 avril 2002, de Barry Butcher \u00e0 Kevin Wilson, deux employ\u00e9s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, que nous retrouvons dans la preuve documentaire admise et conjointe du plaignant, de la commission et de l'intim\u00e9e, et qui, entre autres, d\u00e9clare :\n[Traduction]\nL'employ\u00e9 [Desrosiers] a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en bonne et due forme devant la Commission des droits de la personne. Si l'affaire se retrouve devant un tribunal, je veux \u00eatre s\u00fbr que nous savons tr\u00e8s bien ce qui en est et que nous avons une trace \u00e9crite quant \u00e0 son aptitude \u00e0 satisfaire aux exigences physiques de l'emploi. Il semble \u00e0 ce moment-ci qu'il pourrait \u00eatre en mesure d'ex\u00e9cuter certaines fonctions du poste gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des dispositifs d'aide, mais qu'il y en ait d'autres pour lesquelles cela est douteux.\n[64] Voil\u00e0 le type d'interrogation que l'employeur aurait d\u00fb se poser en 1997 et non en 2002.\n[65] Je suis conscient en l'esp\u00e8ce que la candidature de Desrosiers a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e au stade de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection et que rien n'indique qu'il aurait obtenu le poste s'il avait pass\u00e9 ce stade mais puisque les parties ont choisi la bifurcation des questions de fonds et de redressement, je n'ai pas, \u00e0 ce moment, \u00e0 poursuivre plus loin l'analyse de cette question.\nVII. CONCLUSION [66] Les questions suivantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises au tribunal par les parties :\na) La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a-t-elle fait preuve d'un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e0 l'endroit de Desrosiers en rejetant sa candidature au poste d'Analyste de gestion en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience ou la perception d'une d\u00e9ficience (blessure au dos) ou de sa situation de famille, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6 ?\n...\nLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a fait preuve d'un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e0 l'endroit de Desrosiers en rejetant sa candidature au poste d'Analyste de gestion en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience ou la perception d'une d\u00e9ficience (blessure au dos) contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6.\nLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'a pas fait preuve d'un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e0 l'endroit de Desrosiers en raison de sa situation de famille.\n...\nb) Si le Tribunal r\u00e9pond dans l'affirmative \u00e0 la question pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, a-t-elle d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le rejet de la candidature de Desrosiers s'explique par une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de la jurisprudence et\/ou la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6 ?\n...\nLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le rejet de la candidature de Desrosiers s'explique par une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de la jurisprudence et\/ou la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6.\nVIII. MAINTIEN DE LA COMP\u00c9TENCE [67] \u00c0 la demande des parties, le tribunal se r\u00e9serve la comp\u00e9tence de convoquer une deuxi\u00e8me audience afin de permettre aux parties de pr\u00e9senter de la preuve et des plaidoiries sur la question de la r\u00e9paration.\n[68] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le tribunal contactera les parties afin de fixer une date pour la poursuite de l'audience.\n\u00ab Originale sign\u00e9e par \u00bb\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 10 juillet 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL No : T731\/3602\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Martin Desrosiers c.

Mme Montreuil affirme qu'elle est une transsexuelle.\n[2] La Banque a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 deux requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires relativement \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Montreuil. La premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate visait \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte pour le motif que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne ne jouissait pas du degr\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire d'ind\u00e9pendance et d'impartialit\u00e9 institutionnelles en raison de certaines dispositions de sa loi habilitante. Cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de la r\u00e9cente d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Bell Canada c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone(1).\n[3] La deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Banque visait le rejet sommaire de la plainte de Mme Montreuil. Dans le libell\u00e9 de la plainte, Mme Montreuil explique son affirmation voulant qu'elle soit transsexuelle, pr\u00e9cisant qu'elle s'habille en femme et est actuellement en p\u00e9riode de transition pour devenir une femme(2). La Banque soutient que dans le cours d'une instance devant la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec(3), Mme Montreuil a reconnu qu'elle n'avait pas l'intention de subir la chirurgie pour changement de sexe. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Banque affirme que Mme Montreuil, de son propre aveu, n'est pas une transsexuelle en passe de devenir une femme. Par cons\u00e9quent, sa plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement.\n[4] Mme Montreuil pr\u00e9tend qu'elle a toujours maintenu qu'elle est une transgenre (sic), c'est-\u00e0-dire une personne qui est en transition entre le sexe masculin et le sexe f\u00e9minin. Selon elle, certaines gens d\u00e9crivent les transgenres comme des transsexuels au stade pr\u00e9-op\u00e9ratoire. D'autres les d\u00e9crivent comme des travestis \u00e0 temps plein. D'autres encore les consid\u00e8rent comme \u00e9tant en partie des hommes et en partie des femmes ou, si l'on pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, des mi-femme et mi-homme. Quelle que soit la terminologie qu'on utilise, il est \u00e9vident, d'apr\u00e8s Mme Montreuil, qu'une transgenderiste est une personne qui en est \u00e0 un stade \u00e9volutif et qui pourrait devenir un jour transsexuelle. Mme Montreuil soutient que le stade o\u00f9 elle en est dans ce processus \u00e9volutif ne concerne en rien la Banque. Selon elle, il s'agit d'une question personnelle et la position adopt\u00e9e par la Banque constitue une intrusion intol\u00e9rable dans sa vie priv\u00e9e.\n[5] Mme Montreuil demande que le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate de la Banque avec d\u00e9pens.\n[6] La question fondamentale pour le Tribunal face \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la plainte de Mme Montreuil met en cause un motif de distinction illicite aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Si ce n'est pas le cas, il ne peut y avoir violation de la Loi, et la plainte doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[7] Dans sa plainte, Mme Montreuil se d\u00e9crit comme une transsexuelle. Il existe de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui font jurisprudence et dans lesquelles les tribunaux ont conclu que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le transsexualisme constitue une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe(4).\n[8] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincue qu'\u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, la plainte de Mme Montreuil s'inscrit \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur des param\u00e8tres de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et doit \u00eatre instruite afin de d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations peuvent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9es.\n[9] La Banque semble s'inscrire en faux contre l'affirmation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la plainte de Mme Montreuil selon laquelle elle est une transsexuelle en passe de devenir une femme. Si elle est d'avis que Mme Montreuil n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 coh\u00e9rente dans la description de son \u00e9tat, la Banque voudra peut-\u00eatre soulever cet aspect en contre-interrogatoire.\n[10] Il me semble qu'en fin de compte, il faut s'appuyer sur un fondement probatoire pour d\u00e9terminer si une personne qui se d\u00e9crit comme une transsexuelle mais qui n'a pas l'intention de subir la chirurgie pour changement de sexe est, en fait, une transsexuelle. Par cons\u00e9quent, la question doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e dans le cours de l'audience proprement dite, et non \u00e0 titre de question pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[11] La requ\u00eate de la Banque est donc rejet\u00e9e sans porter atteinte au droit de la Banque de faire valoir cet argument \u00e0 l'audience sur le fond de la plainte de Mme Montreuil.\n[12] En ce qui concerne la requ\u00eate de Mme Montreuil concernant les d\u00e9pens, je souscris \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de la Banque, \u00e0 savoir que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne conf\u00e8re pas au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjuger \u00e0 une partie des d\u00e9pens \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 indemniser la victime des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte. Cette disposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme incluant l'adjudication de d\u00e9pens(5). Cependant, le pouvoir de redressement conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'article 53 de la Loi ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 par le Tribunal qu'une fois qu'il a conclu que la partie intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire. Aucune conclusion en ce sens n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nI.

Mactavish\n[1] Les questionnaires pr\u00e9paratoires \u00e0 l'audience remplis par les parties exposent trois questions pr\u00e9liminaires dans cette affaire.\n[2] En premier lieu, la plaignante demande que l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause dans cette proc\u00e9dure soit modifi\u00e9 afin de remplacer son nom de femme mari\u00e9e, en l'occurrence Danielle Plante, par son nom de jeune fille, en l'occurrence Danielle C\u00f4t\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 cette modification. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause sera modifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 indiquer le nom actuellement utilis\u00e9 par la plaignante.\n[3] Dans son questionnaire, l'intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve, comme question pr\u00e9liminaire, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal \u00e0 entendre cette cause, compte tenu d'un accord de r\u00e8glement conclu \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence par les parties en f\u00e9vrier 1999. Dans ses expos\u00e9s \u00e9crits, l'intim\u00e9e demande que cette question soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e lors de l'audience. Je conviens qu'il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de r\u00e9gler cette question dans le contexte d'une audience et je reporte l'examen de la question \u00e0 ce moment.\n[4] La derni\u00e8re question porte sur l'identit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e. Le formulaire de plainte sign\u00e9 par la plaignante d\u00e9signe son ancien employeur, la Gendarmerie royale du Canada, comme intim\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9e fait valoir que la GRC n'est pas une personne morale et ne peut, de ce fait, faire l'objet d'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droit de la personne. L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend donc que les proc\u00e9dures engag\u00e9es \u00e0 l'encontre de la GRC devraient \u00eatre intent\u00e9es contre le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant la Gendarmerie royale du Canada).\n[5] La plaignante souligne qu'elle \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e par la GRC et que la conduite qui fait l'objet de sa plainte a pr\u00e9tendument \u00e9t\u00e9 le fait d'un membre de la Gendarmerie. La plaignante signale diverses politiques de la GRC traitant du harc\u00e8lement sur les lieux de travail et fait valoir que si la GRC reconna\u00eet ses obligations de fournir un lieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement et ne parvient pas \u00e0 respecter ses obligations, elle s'expose \u00e0 des r\u00e9clamations comme la sienne. La plaignante avance par ailleurs que la GRC a pr\u00e9tendu que la Gendarmerie a elle-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9s\u00e9e par ses actions. La plaignante signale \u00e9galement un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures de ce Tribunal dans des cas o\u00f9 la GRC et d'autres minist\u00e8res \u00e9taient d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme intim\u00e9s.\n[6] La plaignante conteste l'observation de l'intim\u00e9e qu'elle ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice si l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause est modifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 nommer le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada comme intim\u00e9. Si je comprends les observations de la plaignante, elle est d'avis que la GRC, inqui\u00e8te de la fa\u00e7on dont les faits de son affaire influeront sur l'image de marque de la Gendarmerie, s'efforce de se dissimuler derri\u00e8re le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\n[7] Les questions soulev\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9e portent sur les formalit\u00e9s judiciaires de litiges auxquels le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est partie. Je comprends certes comment la demande de l'intim\u00e9e peut appara\u00eetre \u00e0 la plaignante, mais je ne pense pas que la GRC s'efforce de se dissimuler derri\u00e8re le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Je crois plut\u00f4t que la Gendarmerie demande que les strictes exigences de la loi soient observ\u00e9es. Cela ne s'est pas toujours produit dans des affaires entendues pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment par ce Tribunal auxquelles la GRC \u00e9tait partie. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme l'a soulign\u00e9 la plaignante, il existe un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal impliquant la GRC comme intim\u00e9e nomm\u00e9e. Cependant, un examen de la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e, ainsi que les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'\u00c9tat r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que l'intim\u00e9e a raison et que la proc\u00e9dure de la plaignante devrait en bonne et due forme \u00eatre intent\u00e9e contre le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant la Gendarmerie royale du Canada).\n[8] Je n'accepte pas l'observation de la plaignante qu'elle subira un pr\u00e9judice si une telle modification est apport\u00e9e. Le changement de l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause ne devrait pas entra\u00eener de retard dans l'instruction de l'affaire de la plaignante, ni entraver sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire valoir les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qui lui seraient accord\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 sa plainte serait accueillie.\n[9] Pour ces raisons, les deux modifications sont accord\u00e9es. Le nom de la plaignante sera chang\u00e9 de Danielle Plante \u00e0 Danielle C\u00f4t\u00e9. Le nom de l'intim\u00e9e sera remplac\u00e9 par le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant la Gendarmerie royale du Canada).\n\u00ab Originale sign\u00e9e par \u00bb\n_________________________________\nAnne L.

Hadjis\n(TRADUCTION)\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente concerne une affaire que la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne en vue d'une nouvelle audience.\nI. Historique de l'affaire [2] Le 20 mars 1998, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission ), all\u00e9guant que l'intim\u00e9e avait exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination en refusant de continuer de l'employer en raison d'une d\u00e9ficience, soit un pneumothorax au poumon gauche.\n[3] La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pour instruction; une audience a eu lieu en octobre 2001.\n[4] Le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2002, le Tribunal a rendu publique sa d\u00e9cision (la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal ) par laquelle il faisait droit \u00e0 la plainte (Dumont c. Transport Jeannot Gagnon Inc., [2002] T.C.D.P. no 2 (T.C.D.P.) (QL)). Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'indemniser le plaignant de ses pertes salariales. Toutefois, le Tribunal n'a pas ordonn\u00e9 le versement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi ), tel que libell\u00e9 avant qu'il ne soit r\u00e9vis\u00e9 par suite des modifications apport\u00e9es par le projet de loi S-5 en 1998. Le Tribunal a conclu que le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il avait subi un pr\u00e9judice moral justifiant le droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 . Fait int\u00e9ressant, l'examen de la transcription de l'audience r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la Commission n'a pas fait valoir devant le Tribunal d'arguments importants en faveur du versement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, se contentant d'une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale voulant que la preuve et la conduite de l'intim\u00e9e permettent au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance en ce sens.\n[5] La Commission a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. La demande portait strictement sur le refus du Tribunal d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\n[6] Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2002, le jugement de la juge Tremblay-Lamer \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu public (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Dumont, 2002 CFPI 1280). La Cour a reconnu que la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'accorder r\u00e9paration. Cependant, la Cour a \u00e9galement soutenu que le refus du Tribunal d'envisager le versement d'une indemnit\u00e9 quelconque, malgr\u00e9 la preuve non contredite d\u00e9montrant que le plaignant avait subi des dommages moraux, constitue un exercice d\u00e9raisonnable de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour a renvoy\u00e9 l'affaire au Tribunal en vue d'une nouvelle audience devant un panel nouvellement constitu\u00e9. La pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal m'a donc confi\u00e9 le soin de mener cette nouvelle audience.\n[7] La Commission n<a pas produit de nouvelles preuves, mais elle a cependant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par \u00e9crit des observations fond\u00e9es sur le dossier existant et particuli\u00e8rement sur des extraits de la transcription du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant. L'intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 par lettre le greffe du Tribunal qu'elle n'avait pas d'observations ou de commentaires \u00e0 formuler au sujet de l'affaire, se contentant d'affirmer que le plaignant n'avait pas subi de dommages moraux.\nII. Cadre juridique et analyse [8] Les faits \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte sont tous survenus avant que la Loi ne fasse l'objet des modifications qui sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur le 30 juin 1998. Dans l'ancienne version de la Loi, le paragraphe 53(3) se lisait comme suit :\nSpecial compensation\n(3) In addition to any order that the Tribunal may make pursuant to subsection (2), if the Tribunal finds that\n(a) a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly,\nor\n(b) the victim of the discriminatory practice has suffered in respect of feelings or self-respect as a result of the practice,\nthe Tribunal may order the person to pay such compensation to the victim, not exceeding five thousand dollars, as the Tribunal may determine.\n(3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de cinq mille dollars, s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion, selon le cas:\na) que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9;\nb) que la victime en a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\nIndemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale\nOn a soutenu que le maximum de 5 000 $ doit \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux affaires les plus graves parmi celles qui m\u00e9ritent l'octroi d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (Premakumar c. Air Canada (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63, par. 107 (T.C.D.P.); Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, 2003 TCDP 2, par. 128).\n[9] De l'avis de la Commission, les tribunaux des droits de la personne accordent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale lorsqu'ils jugent qu'une plainte est fond\u00e9e. Ce n'est que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles qu'ils refusent d'accorder une telle indemnit\u00e9. M\u00eame s'il se peut fort bien qu'ils aient ordonn\u00e9 le versement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale dans la plupart des cas o\u00f9 ils ont conclu qu'il y avait eu discrimination, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, une telle ordonnance doive n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre rendue. Il faut toujours examiner les circonstances entourant l'affaire et d\u00e9terminer si les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Loi s'appliquent.\n[10] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de chauffeur de camions semi-remorque affect\u00e9 principalement au transport \u00e0 longue distance. Apr\u00e8s avoir subi une perforation du poumon gauche (pneumothorax) \u00e0 l'occasion de la livraison d'un chargement en Ohio, il a suivi des traitements qui l'ont tenu \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart du travail pendant environ un mois. Cependant, l'intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 le plaignant qu'il ne pourrait retourner au travail \u00e0 la fin de cette p\u00e9riode. Selon la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, l'intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 de continuer d'employer le plaignant parce qu'il craignait une rechute. Le Tribunal a donc jug\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e avait exerc\u00e9 une discrimination envers le plaignant en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[11] Par suite de son cong\u00e9diement, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint de chercher un autre emploi. En mai 1998, lorsqu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'abandonner sa carri\u00e8re de camionneur de long parcours, le plaignant avait travaill\u00e9 pour au moins trois employeurs diff\u00e9rents et avait eu quelques \u00e9pisodes de ch\u00f4mage. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, il a indiqu\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 la suite de son cong\u00e9diement, sa confiance en soi a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'effriter et il s'est demand\u00e9 quels autres malheurs l'avenir lui r\u00e9serverait.\n[12] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement subi des pertes de revenus totalisant 1 700 $. Bien que le Tribunal ait ult\u00e9rieurement ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'indemniser le plaignant de ces pertes, le manque \u00e0 gagner a nui \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque \u00e0 son bien-\u00eatre financier, et ce d'autant plus que ses revenus \u00e9taient relativement modestes. Les pertes en question ont peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa faillite ult\u00e9rieure, mais je dois faire remarquer que la preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est insuffisante pour qu'on puisse tirer une telle conclusion.\n[13] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le plaignant est frustr\u00e9 d'avoir eu \u00e0 subir ces inconv\u00e9nients pour rien , pour reprendre les mots qu'il a utilis\u00e9s.\n[14] Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances pertinentes qui entourent cette affaire, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de verser au plaignant la somme de 2 500 $ en guise d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de l'ancienne version de la Loi. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, des int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s sur cette somme; cependant, le versement d'int\u00e9r\u00eats ne doit en aucun cas entra\u00eener le d\u00e9passement de la limite de 5 000 $ (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. H\u00e9bert (1995), C.H.R.R. D\/375, par. 23 (C.F., 1re inst.)).\n\u00ab Originale sign\u00e9e par \u00bb\nAthanasios D.

Toutefois, les documents contenus dans le dossier du service de police de Saanich, qui portent sur les all\u00e9gations d\u2019agression sexuelle, me pr\u00e9occupent particuli\u00e8rement. Certains de ces documents rev\u00eatent un caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9.\n[2] J\u2019ai n\u00e9anmoins constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de dissocier les all\u00e9gations d\u2019agression sexuelle de l\u2019all\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de harc\u00e8lement. Aux fins de la justice naturelle, j\u2019estime donc que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a droit d\u2019examiner le dossier de police dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9paration de sa d\u00e9fense.\n[3] Il reste \u00e0 trancher une question de divulgation. Outre les pouvoirs accessoires dont peut jouir ce Tribunal, le paragraphe 52(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne conf\u00e8re le pouvoir de prendre toute mesure et rendre toute ordonnance qu\u2019il juge n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction. Le l\u00e9gislateur a employ\u00e9 non pas le mot audience mais bien le mot instruction, qu\u2019il faut \u00e0 mon avis interpr\u00e9ter comme englobant la divulgation des documents en vertu des r\u00e8gles du Tribunal.\n[4] Je suis persuad\u00e9e que la divulgation publique des documents particuli\u00e8rement d\u00e9licats pourrait causer un pr\u00e9judice indu \u00e0 la plaignante aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c). J\u2019ordonne donc la communication du dossier \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019on en pr\u00e9serve le caract\u00e8re confidentiel. Les t\u00e9moins m\u00e9dicaux ou psychologiques sont les seules personnes qui ne sont pas \u00e0 l\u2019emploi des avocats \u00e0 pouvoir consulter les documents que renferme le dossier. La m\u00eame consigne s\u2019applique aux renseignements m\u00e9dicaux. Je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que je consid\u00e9rerai tout manquement \u00e0 cette consigne comme une violation de mon ordonnance.\n[5] J\u2019ajouterai que la communication des documents aux fins de la divulgation ne signifie pas qu\u2019ils sont admissibles ou m\u00eame pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019audience. Si l\u2019avocat estime qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de soulever ces points dans le cours de la r\u00e9ception de la preuve, la question pourra \u00eatre r\u00e9examin\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0.\nPaul Groarke\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 28 janvier 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS DU TRIBUNAL Nos :\nT627\/1501 et T628\/1601\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nAmanda Day c. minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale et Michael Hortie\nDATE DE LA D\u00c9CISION DU TRIBUNAL :\nle 28 janvier 2003\nONT COMPARU :\nAmanda Day\nen son propre nom\nJoyce Thayer nationale\nau nom du minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense\nJ.

Trois mois apr\u00e8s avoir eu une crise au travail, M. Milano a perdu son emploi de technicien d\u2019entretien chez Triple K Transport Ltd. Il s\u2019agit dans cette affaire de d\u00e9terminer si les deux \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9taient li\u00e9s.\nI. L\u2019emploi de M. Milano chez Triple K [2] M. Milano est un m\u00e9canicien brevet\u00e9 titulaire de certificats provinciaux qui lui permettent de r\u00e9parer des automobiles, de la machinerie lourde, des autobus et des camions. En plus de d\u00e9tenir ces licences, M. Milano a suivi des cours de formation en m\u00e9canique offerts par des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s comme John Deere et General Motors. Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de M. Milano en m\u00e9canique remontent aux ann\u00e9es 60. Son exp\u00e9rience la plus r\u00e9cente consiste \u00e0 avoir exploit\u00e9 pendant 12 ans en Floride sa propre compagnie de chariots \u00e9l\u00e9vateurs \u00e0 fourche, o\u00f9 il supervisait et effectuait la r\u00e9paration de chariots \u00e9l\u00e9vateurs industriels et notamment de leurs composantes \u00e9lectriques. Ensuite, il a travaill\u00e9 chez John Deere \u00e0 titre de contrema\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019entretien, supervisant entre 10 et 20 m\u00e9caniciens affect\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration de camions et de machinerie lourde. Par la suite, M. Milano a travaill\u00e9 chez Adams Industrial Equipment, o\u00f9 il r\u00e9parait des camions, des remorques, des v\u00e9hicules tous terrains et des chariots \u00e9l\u00e9vateurs \u00e0 fourche.\n[3] En avril 1995, M. Milano a \u00e9tabli son propre atelier de r\u00e9paration d\u2019automobiles. Entre avril 1995 et juillet 1999, M. Milano a travaill\u00e9 avec son gendre, r\u00e9parant des voitures et des camions et effectuant des inspections de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de v\u00e9hicules automobiles de l\u2019Ontario. Apr\u00e8s que son gendre eut quitt\u00e9 l\u2019entreprise, M. Milano est all\u00e9 travailler chez Abbotsford Trucking comme m\u00e9canicien. En 1999, on a diagnostiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il souffrait d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. Cependant, il semble selon ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux qu\u2019il ait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des crises d\u00e8s 1996. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Milano a indiqu\u00e9 que, bien que son \u00e9pilepsie soit maintenant contr\u00f4l\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des m\u00e9dicaments, il avait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des crises en 1999. Ces crises entravaient sa capacit\u00e9 de faire son travail et lui ont fait perdre son permis de conduire. En raison de ses probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux, M. Milano a quitt\u00e9 son emploi chez Abbotsford Trucking.\n[4] \u00c0 la suite de son d\u00e9part de chez Abbotsford Trucking, M. Milano a travaill\u00e9 avec son m\u00e9decin \u00e0 contenir son \u00e9pilepsie et \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer son permis de conduire. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019obtention de son permis, M. Milano a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher un nouvel emploi. Don Greenough comptait parmi les connaissances de M. Milano. M. Greenough travaillait chez Triple K Transport Ltd. \u00e0 Stittsville, en Ontario. Triple K est un transporteur de marchandises lourdes qui se sp\u00e9cialise surtout dans le transport de l\u2019acier et de produits d\u2019acier pour le compte de producteurs d\u2019acier. M. Greenough a dit \u00e0 M. Milano que Triple K \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche de m\u00e9caniciens. M. Milano a rencontr\u00e9 Dave Croft, le directeur de l\u2019entretien chez Triple K. Il a dit que M. Croft lui avait demand\u00e9 durant l\u2019entrevue, s\u2019il avait des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, question qu\u2019il a trouv\u00e9e \u00e9trange. Jugeant qu\u2019il avait son probl\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie bien en main, M. Milano a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative \u00e0 la question de M. Croft.\n[5] M. Milano s\u2019est vu offrir par Triple K un emploi de technicien d\u2019entretien ou, si l\u2019on pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, de m\u00e9canicien \u00e0 compter du 23 octobre 2000. Il \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 au poste de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi (de 14 h 30 \u00e0 23 h) et travaillait sous la surveillance de Del Higginson. Au moment de son embauche, un contrat d\u2019emploi \u00e9crit a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Ce contrat d\u00e9crit ses fonctions comme ... du travail d\u2019atelier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2013 entretien du parc de v\u00e9hicules exploit\u00e9 par Triple K Transport Ltd. Le contrat pr\u00e9voit, entre autres, un [TRADUCTION] \u2026salaire horaire de d\u00e9part de 18,50 $ \/l\u2019heure sujet \u00e0 r\u00e9vision apr\u00e8s trois mois.\n[6] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Milano a dit qu\u2019il adorait travailler chez Triple K. Il aimait le travail et avait d\u2019excellents coll\u00e8gues. Il a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 initi\u00e9 \u00e0 ses fonctions et qu\u2019il avait tout de suite \u00e9t\u00e9 mis dans le feu de l\u2019action, accomplissant toute la gamme des fonctions qu\u2019implique la r\u00e9paration de camions et de remorques chez Triple K.\n[7] Le 10 novembre 2000, M. Milano a eu une crise au travail. Il ne se souvient pas de ce qui s\u2019est produit. Cependant, Don Greenough, qui travaillait pr\u00e8s de lui \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que M. Milano \u00e9tait soudainement tomb\u00e9 au sol. M. Greenough a demand\u00e9 l\u2019aide de ses coll\u00e8gues et une ambulance a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9e sur les lieux. M. Milano se souvient d\u2019avoir repris conscience dans l\u2019ambulance qui l\u2019amenait \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital Queensway-Carleton. Apr\u00e8s quelques heures \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, il a re\u00e7u son cong\u00e9 avec instruction de consulter un neurologue. M. Milano est ensuite all\u00e9 consulter le Dr Hyman Rabinovitch, qui l\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 soign\u00e9. Le 11 novembre 2000, le Dr Rabinovitch a attest\u00e9 que M. Milano \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 retourner au travail, pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il ne pouvait conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur puisque son permis de conduire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 la suite de sa crise.\n[8] M. Milano est retourn\u00e9 au travail chez Triple K. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il se sentait tr\u00e8s bien et que sa m\u00e9dication semblait contr\u00f4ler les crises. Selon lui, le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de rentrer les camions dans l\u2019atelier de r\u00e9paration ne posait pas vraiment probl\u00e8me, car d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s pouvaient le faire \u00e0 sa place. M. Milano a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas eu de difficult\u00e9s avec ses coll\u00e8gues \u00e0 son retour au travail; toutefois, il a dit avoir eu l\u2019impression que Dave Croft le traitait diff\u00e9remment. Ce dernier semblait tr\u00e8s inquiet de la situation de M. Milano et posait beaucoup de questions au sujet de ses m\u00e9dicaments. Fait plus inqui\u00e9tant aux yeux de M. Milano, M. Croft semblait lui parler comme \u00e0 un enfant, comme s\u2019il avait une d\u00e9ficience mentale. Trouvant tr\u00e8s insultant le comportement de M. Croft, M. Milano s\u2019est plaint \u00e0 M. Higginson. Il a \u00e9galement fait part de ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 certains coll\u00e8gues qui, voulant le rassurer, lui ont dit que Dave \u00e9tait simplement [TRADUCTION] comme \u00e7a.\n[9] De la mi\u2011novembre 2000 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2001, M. Milano a continu\u00e9 de travailler chez Triple K, sans qu\u2019il ne survienne d\u2019incident. Selon M. Milano, l\u2019activit\u00e9 au sein de l\u2019atelier de r\u00e9paration \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s f\u00e9brile. Il y avait toujours beaucoup \u00e0 faire. Rien n\u2019indiquait que la compagnie \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res ou s\u2019appr\u00eatait \u00e0 faire des mises \u00e0 pied ou \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 des emplois. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stup\u00e9fait d\u2019apprendre de la bouche de M. Croft le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2001 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait remerci\u00e9. Selon M. Milano, M. Croft lui a fait un long discours sur l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019industrie sid\u00e9rurgique, puis a fini par dire que Triple K mettait fin \u00e0 son emploi. M. Croft a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Milano qu\u2019il \u00e9tait le premier \u00e0 partir parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait le dernier m\u00e9canicien \u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9.\n[10] M. Croft et M. Milano ont convenu que le dernier jour de travail serait le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2001. M\u00eame s\u2019il a trouv\u00e9 humiliant de continuer de venir au travail apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9, M. Milano a [TRADUCTION] raval\u00e9 son orgueil et s\u2019est conduit de fa\u00e7on professionnelle.\n[11] Peu apr\u00e8s la rencontre portant sur la cessation de son emploi, M. Milano a re\u00e7u de la part de M. Croft une lettre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences dans laquelle ce dernier confirmait que son travail \u00e9tait de bonne qualit\u00e9, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accomplir n\u2019importe quelle t\u00e2che qu\u2019on lui confiait et qu\u2019il avait une attitude positive.\n[12] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Milano a dit que son cong\u00e9diement l\u2019avait [TRADUCTION] secou\u00e9. Il n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 voir pourquoi la compagnie mettait fin \u00e0 son emploi. M\u00eame si M. Croft avait \u00e9voqu\u00e9 le marasme qui s\u00e9vissait dans le secteur sid\u00e9rurgique, il lui semblait qu\u2019il y avait beaucoup de travail \u00e0 l\u2019atelier de Triple K et l\u2019entreprise publiait des annonces en vue de recruter d\u2019autres chauffeurs. M. Milano a donc conclu que la conjoncture d\u00e9favorable constituait une excuse.\n[13] M. Milano s\u2019est demand\u00e9 s\u2019il avait dit ou fait quelque chose qui pouvait expliquer la perte de son emploi. Il en est finalement venu \u00e0 la conclusion que sa d\u00e9ficience \u00e9tait la seule explication raisonnable. M. Milano a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s trois mois de travail chez Triple K, il aurait eu droit \u00e0 la protection offerte par le r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-sant\u00e9 de la compagnie. De l\u2019avis de M. Milano, Triple K ne voulait pas lui consentir d\u2019avantages en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\n[14] Les doutes de M. Milano quant \u00e0 la v\u00e9ritable raison de la cessation de son emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renforc\u00e9s lorsqu\u2019il a appris, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 la compagnie le 23 f\u00e9vrier, que Luke Cavanagh avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme m\u00e9canicien chez Triple K.\n[15] Le relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi en date du 23 f\u00e9vrier 2001 remis \u00e0 M. Milano indiquait comme motif de cessation d\u2019emploi cong\u00e9diement plut\u00f4t que manque de travail.\nII. L\u2019explication de Triple K [16] La preuve relative \u00e0 l\u2019explication de Triple K a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Keith Sabiston, Dave Croft et Luke Cavanagh. Keith Sabiston est fondateur, actionnaire et principal dirigeant de Triple K. M. Croft rel\u00e8ve de M. Sabiston.\n[17] Selon M. Sabiston, Triple K \u00e9tait satisfaite du rendement professionnel de M. Milano. Le fait que M. Milano souffrait d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie et avait eu une crise pendant son travail n\u2019a pas contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi au sein de la compagnie. Si la compagnie a d\u00fb remercier M. Milano, c\u2019est en raison du ralentissement de l\u2019activit\u00e9.\n[18] M. Sabiston a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que le transport de marchandises produites par l\u2019industrie sid\u00e9rurgique et particuli\u00e8rement par les producteurs d\u2019acier du Qu\u00e9bec, de l\u2019Ontario et du Michigan repr\u00e9sentait la majeure partie de l\u2019activit\u00e9 de Triple K. Par cons\u00e9quent, Triple K \u00e9tait fortement tributaire de la performance de l\u2019industrie sid\u00e9rurgique nord-am\u00e9ricaine.\n[19] \u00c0 l\u2019hiver 2000\u20112001, l\u2019industrie sid\u00e9rurgique \u00e9tait fort mal en point. \u00c0 la fin de 2000, neuf producteurs am\u00e9ricains d\u2019acier avaient demand\u00e9 la protection de la loi sur les faillites. Au Canada, Algoma Steel, un des principaux clients de Triple K, a vu sa cote de cr\u00e9dit \u00eatre abaiss\u00e9e. En avril 2001, Algoma est devenue insolvable et a \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte de demander la protection de la cour contre ses cr\u00e9anciers. Algoma devait \u00e0 Triple K 230 000 $ au moment o\u00f9 elle a demand\u00e9 la protection de la cour. Triple K \u00e9tait un cr\u00e9ancier non privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 aux termes des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Loi sur les arrangements avec les cr\u00e9anciers des compagnies.\n[20] Les frais d\u2019exploitation de Triple K ont augment\u00e9 par suite de l\u2019escalade du co\u00fbt du carburant. Comme ces co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires ne pouvaient, dans bien des cas, \u00eatre refil\u00e9s aux clients de la compagnie, la marge b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de Triple K a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite d\u2019autant.\n[21] Un accident impliquant un des camions-tracteurs de la compagnie a ajout\u00e9 aux pressions financi\u00e8res subies par Triple K. De toute \u00e9vidence, le camion avait fait tomber la ligne de transport d\u2019\u00e9nergie dans la cour d\u2019un client. Vu le co\u00fbt des assurances, la compagnie avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019auto-assurer pour ce qui est des accidents et avait constitu\u00e9 une r\u00e9serve de 150 000 $ au titre de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile \u00e9ventuelle.\n[22] En novembre 2000, les ventes de Triple K accusaient une baisse de 25 % par rapport \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Par ailleurs, les co\u00fbts de main-d\u2019\u0153uvre de la compagnie \u00e9taient en hausse.\n[23] La conjugaison de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements a fait en sorte que vers la fin de 2000 et au d\u00e9but de 2001, Triple K connaissait le pire ralentissement que M. Sabiston avait vu en 23 ans d\u2019activit\u00e9. La compagnie avait de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Sabiston a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait d\u00fb hypoth\u00e9quer sa r\u00e9sidence afin d\u2019obtenir l\u2019argent n\u00e9cessaire pour renflouer le fonds de roulement de la compagnie. M. Sabiston a d\u00fb \u00e9galement ren\u00e9gocier et augmenter l\u2019emprunt bancaire de la compagnie.\n[24] Triple K a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher des moyens de contenir ses co\u00fbts. La compagnie a r\u00e9duit ses stocks et \u00e9limin\u00e9 les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. En 1999, quatre employ\u00e9s de bureau ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remerci\u00e9s et, en 2000, une douzaine de chauffeurs ont quitt\u00e9 l\u2019entreprise. Ensuite, la compagnie a tourn\u00e9 son attention vers le secteur de l\u2019entretien. Certains travaux d\u2019entretien ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sous-trait\u00e9s. M. Sabiston, de concert avec Dave Croft, a pris la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Milano et d\u2019\u00e9tablir une relation contractuelle avec Luke Cavanagh. Si la compagnie a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de remercier M. Milano, c\u2019est parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait le dernier m\u00e9canicien \u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9, selon M. Sabiston.\n[25] M. Sabiston a expliqu\u00e9 que Luke Cavanagh avait travaill\u00e9 chez Triple K entre novembre 1999 et ao\u00fbt 2000. M. Cavanagh s\u2019\u00e9tait montr\u00e9 int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 revenir travailler chez Triple K. M. Cavanagh n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 recrut\u00e9 pour faire des travaux d\u2019entretien courants, mais plut\u00f4t pour faire l\u2019entretien et la remise \u00e0 neuf d\u2019une vingtaine de remorques de Triple K, y compris certaines vieilles remorques de l\u2019entreprise qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas utilis\u00e9es1. Selon les t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par Triple K, M. Cavanagh devait examiner chaque remorque, \u00e9tablir une liste des travaux \u00e0 faire et effectuer les r\u00e9parations n\u00e9cessaires pour que les remorques puissent \u00eatre vendues ou soient r\u00e9utilisables en cas de reprise de l\u2019activit\u00e9.\n[26] Vu le poids des charges que les camions de Triple K doivent transporter, les remorques-plateaux que la compagnie utilise sont un peu sp\u00e9ciales, comptant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dix essieux. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Dave Croft a affirm\u00e9 que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s une ann\u00e9e de formation et de travail au sein de l\u2019entreprise qu\u2019un m\u00e9canicien brevet\u00e9 d\u2019exp\u00e9rience est capable de faire l\u2019entretien de la machinerie sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e de Triple K. Selon MM. Sabiston et Croft, Luke Cavanagh avait l\u2019exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaire pour remettre \u00e0 neuf ce genre de remorques avec une surveillance minimale.\n[27] M. Sabiston a expliqu\u00e9 que M. Cavanagh n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 aux termes d\u2019un contrat d\u2019emploi, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce en vertu d\u2019un contrat verbal. Il relevait de Dave Croft et \u00e9tait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 au taux de 22,00 $ l\u2019heure, sans retenues \u00e0 la source. M. Cavanagh n\u2019avait droit \u00e0 aucun avantage en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi et \u00e0 aucune majoration pour ses heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. L\u2019une ou l\u2019autre partie pouvait r\u00e9silier le contrat en donnant deux semaines de pr\u00e9avis. M. Cavanagh a travaill\u00e9 entre 50 et 60 heures par semaine chez Triple K jusqu\u2019au moment de son d\u00e9part en novembre 2001. Depuis, Triple K l\u2019a r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9. \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, M. Cavanagh occupe un poste de gestion; il supervise le poste de soir\u00e9e.\n[28] La sous-traitance s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e une fa\u00e7on efficace d\u2019assurer l\u2019entretien des v\u00e9hicules, au dire de M. Sabiston. Plus de la moiti\u00e9 des travaux d\u2019entretien de Triple K sont actuellement sous-trait\u00e9s.\n[29] M\u00eame si le personnel d\u2019entretien de Triple K avait encore beaucoup de travail, la pi\u00e8tre conjoncture \u00e9conomique a finalement contraint la compagnie \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 pied cinq des onze membres du personnel d\u2019entretien. Au d\u00e9but de d\u00e9cembre 2001, Don Greenough et Ted Letts ainsi que trois autres personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied. M. Sabiston a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 mais n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible, tandis que M. Croft a sembl\u00e9 dire que personne n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 qu\u2019en mars 2002, l\u2019emploi des cinq employ\u00e9s avait pris fin.\n[30] M. Sabiston a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Triple K a volontiers compos\u00e9 avec les employ\u00e9s atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Il a d\u00e9crit des cas o\u00f9 des chauffeurs aux prises avec des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019abus d\u2019alcool ou d\u2019autres drogues se sont vu offrir des programmes de r\u00e9adaptation, ainsi que des cas o\u00f9 la compagnie a modifi\u00e9 les t\u00e2ches de membres du personnel d\u2019entretien bless\u00e9s \u00e0 la main ou au poignet. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, M. Croft a indiqu\u00e9 que les restrictions de M. Milano en mati\u00e8re de conduite automobile ne causaient pas de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 la compagnie, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que d\u2019autres m\u00e9caniciens pouvaient conduire les camions, au besoin. Par ailleurs, M. Croft a ni\u00e9 avoir trait\u00e9 M. Milano diff\u00e9remment lorsqu\u2019il est revenu au travail apr\u00e8s sa crise.\nIII. Le droit [31] La plainte de M. Milano a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux termes de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L\u2019article 7 pr\u00e9cise que le fait de refuser de continuer d\u2019employer un individu constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Selon l\u2019article 3 de la Loi, la d\u00e9ficience constitue un motif de discrimination illicite.\n[32] Dans une affaire de cette nature, le plaignant (M. Milano) a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existe une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une fois que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, il appartient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e (Triple K) de fournir une explication raisonnable pour justifier la conduite jug\u00e9e r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible2.\n[33] La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de M. Milano en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de Triple K3.\n[34] Dans le cas d\u2019une plainte relative \u00e0 l\u2019emploi, la preuve prima facie exige de prouver :\nque le plaignant avait les qualifications pour l\u2019emploi en cause;\nque le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 [ou, comme c\u2019est le cas dans cette affaire, qu\u2019on a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi],\nqu\u2019une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui n\u2019avait pas le trait distinctif \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte (race, couleur, etc.) a obtenu le poste4.\n[35] Bien que le crit\u00e8re Shakes soit un guide utile, il ne peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 automatiquement de fa\u00e7on rigide ou arbitraire dans toutes les affaires li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019emploi. En fait, il faut examiner chaque affaire afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019appliquer le crit\u00e8re en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie. En bout de ligne, il s\u2019agira pour moi de d\u00e9terminer si M. Milano a satisfait au crit\u00e8re O\u2019Malley, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. si la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de M. Milano en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e5?\n[36] Si Triple K donne une explication raisonnable d\u2019un comportement autrement discriminatoire, il appartiendra alors \u00e0 M. Milano de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019explication n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte et que les motifs v\u00e9ritables des gestes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient de fait de nature discriminatoire6.\n[37] Il est reconnu dans la jurisprudence qu\u2019il est difficile de prouver des all\u00e9gations de discrimination en s\u2019appuyant sur une preuve directe. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Basi,\n[TRADUCTION]\n[la] discrimination n\u2019est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu\u2019on puisse prouver par des preuves directes qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement. (p. D\/5038)\n[38] Il revient donc au Tribunal de prendre en compte toutes les circonstances afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe, pour reprendre l\u2019expression utilis\u00e9e dans Basi, de subtiles odeurs de discrimination.\n[39] La norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination est celle qui s\u2019applique dans les causes civiles ordinaires, soit la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Dans le cas d\u2019une preuve circonstancielle, le crit\u00e8re peut \u00eatre formul\u00e9 comme suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nOn peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que les autres conclusions ou hypoth\u00e8ses possibles7.\n[40] Pour faire droit \u00e0 la plainte, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre discriminatoire soient le seul motif des actes reproch\u00e9s. Il suffit d\u2019\u00e9tablir que la d\u00e9ficience de M. Milano a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de Triple K de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi8.\nIV.L\u2019analyse A. Existe-t-il une preuve prima facie de discrimination? [41] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, M. Milano a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par Triple K. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que M. Milano \u00e9tait un m\u00e9canicien comp\u00e9tent et chevronn\u00e9 et que son rendement durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 au service de la compagnie n\u2019a suscit\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9occupation. M. Milano a eu une crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au travail. Triple K admet que l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie de M. Milano constitue une d\u00e9ficience. Quelques semaines plus tard, Triple K a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Milano. Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s, Luke Cavanagh a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez Triple K, exer\u00e7ant des fonctions de m\u00e9canicien.\n[42] Triple K soutient que M. Milano et la Commission n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie puisque le poste pour lequel Luke Cavanagh a \u00e9t\u00e9 recrut\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas celui qu\u2019occupait M. Milano. Ce dernier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour faire des travaux d\u2019entretien courant ou pr\u00e9ventif. Ce poste n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que la compagnie eut mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Milano. Luke Cavanagh a \u00e9t\u00e9 recrut\u00e9 pour effectuer un travail diff\u00e9rent, soit la remise \u00e0 neuf des remorques de Triple K. Triple K affirme donc que le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re Shakes n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli et que la plainte doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[43] Comme je l\u2019expliquerai plus en d\u00e9tail plus loin dans cette d\u00e9cision, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9e que Luke Cavanagh a travaill\u00e9 principalement \u00e0 la remise \u00e0 neuf de remorques. Il est \u00e9vident d\u2019apr\u00e8s les feuilles de temps d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience que M. Cavanagh a fait des r\u00e9parations aux remorques de Triple K. Toutefois, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des autres techniciens d\u2019entretien de Triple K, M. Cavanagh a \u00e9galement fait beaucoup de travaux sur les camions-tracteurs. Je ne suis pas convaincue non plus que la remise \u00e0 neuf de remorques est une t\u00e2che suffisamment diff\u00e9rente de celles accomplies par les techniciens d\u2019entretien de Triple K pour qu\u2019elle puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un poste diff\u00e9rent, au sens du crit\u00e8re Shakes.\n[44] En 2000, M. Milano justifiait de plus de 30 ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans la r\u00e9paration de v\u00e9hicules automobiles et de camions. En outre, il d\u00e9tenait des certificats provinciaux de comp\u00e9tence qui l\u2019autorisaient \u00e0 r\u00e9parer des automobiles, de la machinerie lourde, des autobus et des camions. Par contraste, Luke Cavanagh a obtenu son dipl\u00f4me de l\u2019\u00e9cole secondaire technique en 1991 et avait, au plus, douze ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience comme m\u00e9canicien, y compris plusieurs ann\u00e9es de travail \u00e0 temps partiel alors qu\u2019il fr\u00e9quentait l\u2019\u00e9cole secondaire. M. Cavanagh avait un permis provincial pour r\u00e9parer des automobiles, des autobus et des camions, mais il n\u2019avait pas le certificat de comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9parer de la machinerie lourde. L\u2019un et l\u2019autre avaient de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans la r\u00e9paration des camions et remorques de Triple K. Ils \u00e9taient tous deux consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des employ\u00e9s comp\u00e9tents. Pour les motifs que j\u2019examinerai plus en d\u00e9tail dans la prochaine section de cette d\u00e9cision, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9e que l\u2019exp\u00e9rience plus longue de Luke Cavanagh chez Triple K faisait de lui une personne mieux qualifi\u00e9e que M. Milano pour remettre \u00e0 neuf les remorques de la compagnie.\n[45] M. Cavanagh a d\u00e9crit sa sant\u00e9 comme parfaite. Contrairement \u00e0 M. Milano, M. Cavanagh n\u2019est atteint d\u2019aucune d\u00e9ficience, n\u2019a pas eu de crise au travail et peut, sans restriction aucune, conduire un v\u00e9hicule automobile.\n[46] \u00c0 mon avis, les faits d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus suffisent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il existe une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience; par cons\u00e9quent, il revient maintenant \u00e0 Triple K de fournir une explication.\nB. L\u2019explication de Triple K est-elle raisonnable ou n\u2019est-elle qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte? [47] Triple K all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle a d\u00fb remercier M. Milano en raison d\u2019un ralentissement de son activit\u00e9, pr\u00e9cisant que cette mesure s\u2019inscrivait dans un exercice de r\u00e9duction des effectifs amorc\u00e9 en 1999 qui s\u2019est poursuivi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de 2001. Le fait que M. Milano ait souffert d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie et ait eu une crise au travail n\u2019a aucunement jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Triple K pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que Luke Cavanagh a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 comme entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant dans le cadre d\u2019un effort pour impartir ou sous-traiter le travail d\u2019entretien. En outre, Triple K soutient que M. Cavanagh a \u00e9t\u00e9 recrut\u00e9 pour accomplir une t\u00e2che particuli\u00e8re, \u00e0 savoir la remise \u00e0 neuf d\u2019une vingtaine de remorques, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement comp\u00e9tent pour faire ce travail.\n[48] J\u2019admets que Triple K s\u2019est d\u00e9partie de quatre employ\u00e9s de bureau en 1999. Cependant, je n\u2019admets pas que ces cessations d\u2019emploi constituaient l\u2019amorce d\u2019un effort de r\u00e9duction des effectifs de la compagnie. Le 28 juillet 2000, M. Sabiston a transmis aux employ\u00e9s de Triple K une note de service portant sur la campagne de recrutement de la compagnie. Selon la note de M. Sabiston, la compagnie faisait du recrutement pour combler des postes dans trois secteurs de l\u2019organisation \u2013 chauffeurs, m\u00e9caniciens et personnel administratif. M. Sabiston indiquait dans sa note que les employ\u00e9s pouvaient donner un tr\u00e8s bon coup de pouce \u00e0 la compagnie en l\u2019aidant \u00e0 recruter des employ\u00e9s et leur demandait de passer le mot que Triple K embauchait. Il d\u00e9crivait la situation comme suit :\n...la compagnie compte actuellement 70 employ\u00e9s r\u00e9partis dans trois secteurs :\nChauffeurs 48\nM\u00e9caniciens 12\nPersonnel de bureau 10\n70 personnes\nLa composition actuelle de la compagnie devrait \u00eatre la suivante :\nChauffeurs 56\nM\u00e9caniciens 16\nEmploy\u00e9s de bureau 10\n82 personnes\nM. Sabiston concluait en pr\u00e9cisant que la compagnie cherchait \u00e0 engager huit chauffeurs et quatre m\u00e9caniciens.\n[49] Il existe au moins certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui indiquent que c\u2019est cette note de service qui a incit\u00e9 Don Greenough \u00e0 sugg\u00e9rer \u00e0 M. Milano de faire une demande d\u2019emploi chez Triple K. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le fait que M. Milano ait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par Triple K en octobre 2000 d\u00e9montre que la compagnie ne cherchait pas, du moins \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, \u00e0 \u00e9liminer des postes \u00e0 l\u2019atelier d\u2019entretien.\n[50] Triple K soutient aussi que la compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte en raison des pressions financi\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9liminer les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires afin de contenir les co\u00fbts. L\u2019examen des feuilles de temps de Triple K confirme que le nombre d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9es a effectivement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 diminuer vers la fin de f\u00e9vrier 2001. Cependant, on se rappellera que M. Cavanagh devait travailler jusqu\u2019\u00e0 60 heures par semaine, sans majoration pour ses heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Si l\u2019on tient compte des heures qu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9es en sus de la semaine normale de 40 heures, il semble que le nombre total d\u2019heures travaill\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019atelier de r\u00e9paration n\u2019ait pas sensiblement diminu\u00e9.\n[51] M. Cavanagh n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 des avantages en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi. De plus, il ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d\u2019aucune majoration pour ses heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, tandis que les heures travaill\u00e9es par les employ\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers de Triple K en sus du seuil de 40 heures \u00e9taient r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 tarif et demi. Par cons\u00e9quent, Triple K a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9conomis\u00e9 quelque peu en embauchant M. Cavanagh. Toutefois, il faudrait d\u00e9falquer du montant \u00e9conomis\u00e9 les co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires li\u00e9s au fait que le taux horaire de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de M. Cavanagh pour ses 40 premi\u00e8res heures de travail chaque semaine \u00e9tait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[52] Tout compte fait, en engageant M. Cavanagh, Triple K n\u2019a pas gagn\u00e9 grand-chose du point de vue financier.\n[53] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que la remise \u00e0 neuf des remorques de Triple K a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une partie du travail de M. Cavanagh. L\u2019examen des feuilles de temps disponibles de M. Cavanagh r\u00e9v\u00e8le toutefois que celui\u2011ci n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 uniquement \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration des remorques et qu\u2019il a aussi fait des travaux sur les camions. Les feuilles de temps qu\u2019on m\u2019a fournies pour M. Cavanagh portent uniquement sur ses trois derniers mois de travail chez Triple K \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant. Ces feuilles indiquent que, durant la semaine termin\u00e9e le 1er septembre 2001, M. Cavanagh a travaill\u00e9 sur une remorque pendant dix heures mais qu\u2019il a pass\u00e9 46,50 heures \u00e0 r\u00e9parer les camions de Triple K. De m\u00eame, durant la semaine termin\u00e9e le 20 octobre, M. Cavanagh a travaill\u00e9 45,50 heures, dont plus de 21 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration des camions. Trois semaines plus tard, M. Cavanagh a travaill\u00e9 au total 51,25 heures, passant au moins 39,75 heures \u00e0 effectuer des r\u00e9parations aux camions. Par cons\u00e9quent, Triple K ne m\u2019a pas persuad\u00e9e que M. Cavanagh a surtout travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la remise \u00e0 neuf de remorques.\n[54] En outre, je n\u2019admets pas que M. Milano n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de faire ce travail. M. Cavanagh avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 chez Triple K pendant 10 mois, comparativement \u00e0 un peu plus de trois mois dans le cas de M. Milano9. Toutefois, M. Milano justifiait d\u2019une plus vaste exp\u00e9rience professionnelle que M. Cavanagh, ainsi que de comp\u00e9tences professionnelles sup\u00e9rieures.\n[55] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Triple K a beaucoup fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un point confus dans le t\u00e9moignage de M. Milano, \u00e0 savoir le nombre d\u2019essieux que comptent les remorques de Triple K, dans le but de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il ne connaissait pas bien ces remorques. Comme plus de deux ann\u00e9es se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis le d\u00e9part de M. Milano de chez Triple K, je ne suis pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 partir de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment que M. Milano ne connaissait pas suffisamment bien les remorques de Triple K pour faire le travail de remise \u00e0 neuf.\n[56] Dave Croft a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison de la nature sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e des camions-tracteurs et des remorques de Triple K, il fallait une ann\u00e9e pour qu\u2019un m\u00e9canicien chevronn\u00e9 se familiarise avec le mat\u00e9riel de la compagnie. N\u00e9anmoins, M. Cavanagh a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour faire ce travail manifestement tr\u00e8s exigeant, sans aucune surveillance, alors qu\u2019il n\u2019avait que dix mois d\u2019exp\u00e9rience chez Triple K. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage de Del Higginson, qui a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s moins d\u2019un mois de travail au sein de la compagnie, un m\u00e9canicien \u00e9tait bien au fait des d\u00e9tails entourant les fa\u00e7ons de faire et le mat\u00e9riel de Triple K. En concluant que je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage de M. Higginson \u00e0 celui de M. Croft, je tiens compte du fait que M. Higginson a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de chez Triple K en raison d\u2019un diff\u00e9rend fondamental quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019entreprise faisait les choses, et que, de toute \u00e9vidence, le courant ne passait pas entre M. Higginson et la direction de Triple K. N\u00e9anmoins, M. Higginson a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 mon avis un t\u00e9moin honn\u00eate et pond\u00e9r\u00e9, et je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re sa version \u00e0 celle de M. Croft sur ce point.\n[57] Ted Letts et Don Greenough ont tous deux affirm\u00e9 que le travail que Luke Cavanagh faisait pour remettre \u00e0 neuf les remorques pouvait \u00eatre accompli par n\u2019importe lequel des m\u00e9caniciens de la compagnie. J\u2019ai certaines r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de ces personnes, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celui de M. Letts, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ce dernier et M. Greenough \u00e9taient tous deux manifestement amers d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied par Triple K en d\u00e9cembre 2001. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019h\u00e9siterais \u00e0 m\u2019en remettre exclusivement \u00e0 leur t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Cependant, Del Higginson, qui, je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin digne de foi, a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que M. Milano poss\u00e9dait les comp\u00e9tences et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaires pour faire le travail de remise \u00e0 neuf. M. Higginson a supervis\u00e9 M. Milano durant les quatre mois o\u00f9 ce dernier a travaill\u00e9 chez Triple K et, de ce fait, \u00e9tait bien en mesure de d\u00e9terminer si M. Milano aurait pu faire le travail confi\u00e9 \u00e0 Luke Cavanagh.\n[58] En supposant que Triple K ait vraiment cru que M. Milano n\u2019avait pas les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour remettre \u00e0 neuf les remorques, d\u2019autres m\u00e9caniciens poss\u00e9dant plusieurs ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience au sein de la compagnie auraient pu faire ce travail. M. Sabiston a affirm\u00e9 que la compagnie avait tent\u00e9 de confier le travail \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s de Triple K mais que, finalement, leur attention \u00e9tait constamment d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e vers des t\u00e2ches plus urgentes et que le travail de r\u00e9paration des remorques ne se faisait pas. Triple K a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que M. Cavanagh a \u00e9t\u00e9 recrut\u00e9 pour travailler exclusivement \u00e0 la remise \u00e0 neuf des remorques; cependant, comme je l\u2019ai fait remarquer pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les feuilles de temps de M. Cavanagh d\u00e9montrent clairement que son travail ne s\u2019est pas limit\u00e9 \u00e0 la remise \u00e0 neuf des remorques de Triple K.\n[59] MM. Sabiston et Croft ont tous deux affirm\u00e9 que Triple K avait mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Milano en f\u00e9vrier 2001 en raison du ralentissement que la compagnie a connu. En d\u00e9cembre 2001, la compagnie a remerci\u00e9 cinq autres employ\u00e9s pour les m\u00eames raisons. Cependant, ces employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied et \u00e9taient susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre rappel\u00e9s au travail; leur relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi indiquait qu\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied par suite d\u2019un manque de travail. Par contraste, dans le cas de M. Milano, la compagnie a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi, sans possibilit\u00e9 de rappel au travail. Pri\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer pourquoi M. Milano avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des autres employ\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, M. Croft ne m\u2019a pas fourni d\u2019explication satisfaisante quant \u00e0 ce traitement distinct. Force est de conclure que Triple K ne voulait plus que M. Milano travaille au sein de l\u2019entreprise.\n[60] Il convient \u00e9galement de souligner que Triple K a tent\u00e9 de justifier le choix de M. Milano pour la cessation d\u2019emploi de f\u00e9vrier 2001 en disant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait la derni\u00e8re personne embauch\u00e9e, donnant ainsi \u00e0 croire que la compagnie se fondait sur un r\u00e9gime d\u2019anciennet\u00e910. Cependant, MM. Sabiston et Croft ont convenu que l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 n\u2019avait aucunement influenc\u00e9 le choix des personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises \u00e0 pied dix mois plus tard.\n[61] J\u2019admets que Triple K a subi des pressions financi\u00e8res par suite du marasme qui a s\u00e9vi dans l\u2019industrie sid\u00e9rurgique et que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment a peut-\u00eatre beaucoup contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la mise \u00e0 pied des cinq m\u00e9caniciens en d\u00e9cembre 2001. Cependant, au regard de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, Triple K ne m\u2019a pas persuad\u00e9e que la cessation d\u2019emploi de M. Milano une dizaine de mois auparavant \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement attribuable \u00e0 la pi\u00e8tre situation financi\u00e8re de la compagnie. En f\u00e9vrier 2001, Triple K ne voulait plus de toute \u00e9vidence que M. Milano travaille au sein de l\u2019entreprise. Pourquoi? Compte tenu de l\u2019affirmation de la compagnie que le rendement de M. Milano au travail \u00e9tait satisfaisant, la seule conclusion logique est que Triple K ne voulait pas d\u2019un \u00e9pileptique dans son atelier d\u2019entretien.\n[62] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par Triple K en ce qui concerne sa d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Milano en f\u00e9vrier 2001 est \u00e0 mon avis un pr\u00e9texte. Certes, MM. Sabiston et Croft tenaient Luke Cavanagh en haute estime. Il se peut fort bien que leur d\u00e9sir de lib\u00e9rer un poste \u00e0 l\u2019atelier d\u2019entretien afin de permettre \u00e0 M. Cavanagh de retourner chez Triple K ait influenc\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Milano. N\u00e9anmoins, au regard de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, je suis convaincue que le fait que M. Milano ait \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie et ait eu une crise alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au travail a beaucoup jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Pour ces motifs, le Tribunal fait droit \u00e0 la plainte de M. Milano.\nV. Mesures de redressement [63] Ayant conclu \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de Triple K, il me reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer quelles mesures de redressement doivent \u00eatre prises en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est r\u00e9gie par l\u2019article 53 de la Loi, qui porte sur l\u2019imposition de mesures de redressement destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes discriminatoires semblables, ainsi que sur l\u2019indemnisation des victimes. Le but de l\u2019indemnisation dans les affaires de discrimination est de remettre la victime dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019acte discriminatoire, sous r\u00e9serve des principes de l\u2019att\u00e9nuation des pertes, de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 raisonnable et du caract\u00e8re lointain du dommage11.\nA. Correctif syst\u00e9mique [64] La Commission demande que j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 Triple K de cesser d\u2019exercer une discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des employ\u00e9s atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et de consulter la Commission au sujet de sa politique concernant le traitement des employ\u00e9s qui souffrent d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. En outre, la Commission demande que la direction de Triple K soit tenue de suivre un programme de sensibilisation \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019accommoder des employ\u00e9s atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience.\n[65] Comme l\u2019un des objectifs de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne en mati\u00e8re de redressement est de pr\u00e9venir des actes discriminatoires semblables, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019une telle ordonnance s\u2019impose dans les circonstances. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne que Triple K cesse d\u2019exercer une discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. J\u2019ordonne \u00e9galement \u00e0 Triple K de consulter la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne afin d\u2019\u00e9laborer une politique sur l\u2019accommodement des employ\u00e9s qui souffrent d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. En outre, Triple K doit, dans les trois mois suivant la publication de sa politique sur l\u2019accommodement, fournir \u00e0 ses cadres sup\u00e9rieurs une formation sur les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019application de cette politique ainsi que sur les obligations des employeurs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, y compris l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement.\nB. Pertes salariales [66] M. Milano demande d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 des pertes salariales qu\u2019il a subies entre le dernier jour o\u00f9 il a travaill\u00e9 chez Triple K, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2001, et le moment o\u00f9 il a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein en f\u00e9vrier 2003, moins tout revenu tir\u00e9 des emplois occasionnels qu\u2019il a occup\u00e9s dans cet intervalle. \u00c0 mon avis, M. Milano devrait \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 du salaire et des avantages en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi qu\u2019il a perdus durant la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 23 f\u00e9vrier et le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2001.\n[67] En novembre 2001, Triple K a r\u00e9sili\u00e9 le contrat de M. Cavanagh. Le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2001, la compagnie a mis \u00e0 pied cinq m\u00e9caniciens sur onze. La Commission et M. Milano soutiennent que ces mises \u00e0 pied repr\u00e9sentaient une tentative de Triple K pour faire maison nette, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire pour se d\u00e9barrasser des employ\u00e9s consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme m\u00e9contents. Certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve appuient cette opinion, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que plusieurs des personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises \u00e0 pied avaient eu un affrontement avec la direction au sujet des pratiques au sein de la compagnie. En outre, au printemps de 2002, quelques semaines \u00e0 peine apr\u00e8s la fin de la p\u00e9riode de rappel, Triple K faisait de la publicit\u00e9 en vue de recruter de nouveaux m\u00e9caniciens.\n[68] Quels que soient les motifs qui ont incit\u00e9 la compagnie \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 pied ces personnes en particulier, j\u2019admets, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci\u2011haut, que l\u2019entreprise connaissait certaines difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res durant cette p\u00e9riode et que cette situation l\u2019a amen\u00e9e \u00e0 proc\u00e9der aux mises \u00e0 pied et \u00e0 r\u00e9silier le contrat de M. Cavanagh. Si M. Milano avait travaill\u00e9 chez Triple K en d\u00e9cembre 2001, je suis convaincue qu\u2019il aurait, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. Si tant est que le choix des personnes \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 pied aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9 par le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9, M. Milano \u00e9tait l\u2019employ\u00e9 le plus nouveau. Si Triple K a vraiment mis \u00e0 pied des employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des critiqueurs, comme le pr\u00e9tendent M. Milano et la Commission, M. Milano aurait peut-\u00eatre fait partie du lot. M. Milano est certes une personne tr\u00e8s intelligente. C\u2019est quelqu\u2019un qui n\u2019a pas peur de d\u00e9fendre son opinion. En fait, il ressort clairement des excellents contre-interrogatoires auxquels M. Milano a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au cours de l\u2019audience qu\u2019il ne craint pas de contredire ceux avec lesquels il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord. Compte tenu de la culture qui existait chez Triple K en d\u00e9cembre 2001, je suis d\u2019avis que M. Milano aurait, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, fait partie du lot d\u2019employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied.\n[69] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne d\u2019indemniser M. Milano du salaire et des avantages en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi qu\u2019il a perdus durant la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 23 f\u00e9vrier et le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2001, moins les revenus tir\u00e9s d\u2019autres sources au cours de cette p\u00e9riode. Si les parties ne peuvent en venir \u00e0 une entente au sujet des sommes dues \u00e0 M. Milano aux termes de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, elles peuvent communiquer avec moi.\n[70] N\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de la conduite discriminatoire de Triple K, M. Milano n\u2019aurait pas eu \u00e0 participer \u00e0 cette audience. Comme les mesures de redressement visent \u00e0 remettre la partie plaignante qui a gain de cause dans la position o\u00f9 elle se trouvait avant l\u2019acte discriminatoire, M. Milano devrait \u00e9galement \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 des pertes salariales qu\u2019il a subies en raison de sa participation \u00e0 l\u2019audience, pertes qui, selon lui, s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8vent \u00e0 720 $.\nC. Majoration [71] M. Milano travaille actuellement. En plus du salaire qu\u2019il touche dans ce nouvel emploi, voil\u00e0 qu\u2019il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiera d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 salariale forfaitaire. Il en r\u00e9sultera sans doute des cons\u00e9quences fiscales n\u00e9gatives pour lui. \u00c0 mon avis, il serait injuste de p\u00e9naliser M. Milano en lui imposant un fardeau fiscal plus lourd par suite du paiement d\u2019une somme forfaitaire en lieu et place des versements salariaux qu\u2019il aurait re\u00e7us en 2001. Cela serait incompatible avec l\u2019objectif des mesures de redressement, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire remettre M. Milano dans la position o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019acte discriminatoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, Triple K doit verser \u00e0 M. Milano une somme suppl\u00e9mentaire suffisante pour compenser l\u2019imp\u00f4t suppl\u00e9mentaire qu\u2019il aura \u00e0 payer du fait qu\u2019il recevra un paiement forfaitaire.\nD. Frais remboursables [72] En pr\u00e9vision de cette audience, M. Milano a pay\u00e9 45 $ pour obtenir des photocopies de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux. Il doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9pense.\n[73] En outre, avec l\u2019aide de son fils, M. Milano a retenu les services de Nelligan, O\u2019Brien, Payne, un cabinet d\u2019avocats d\u2019Ottawa, pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer sa plainte concernant les droits de la personne. Nelligan a factur\u00e9 au total 11 248,26 $ pour les services rendus dans cette affaire, d\u00e9bours et TPS inclus.\n[74] La jurisprudence \u00e9manant de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale quant au pouvoir du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne d\u2019adjuger des frais juridiques raisonnables au plaignant qui a gain de cause est contradictoire12Pour les motifs que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel du Canada13 et Premakumar c. Air Canada14, je suis d\u2019avis que des consid\u00e9rations de principe imp\u00e9rieuses militent en faveur de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que donnent de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne le juge Gibson dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Thwaites et le juge Rouleau dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Stevenson, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire que le sens qu\u2019on pr\u00eate ordinairement au mot frais englobe les frais juridiques.\n[75] \u00c0 mon avis, il y a lieu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019ordonner le remboursement des frais juridiques raisonnables de M. Milano afin d\u2019atteindre l\u2019objectif visant \u00e0 le remettre dans la position o\u00f9 il se trouvait avant l\u2019acte discriminatoire. Si les parties ne peuvent s\u2019entendre sur le montant exact des frais juridiques de M. Milano, elles peuvent communiquer avec moi.\nE. Pr\u00e9judice moral [76] M. Milano demande une indemnit\u00e9 de 20 000 $, soit l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale pr\u00e9vue par la Loi, pour compenser le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019il a subi du fait que Triple K a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n[77] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Milano a affirm\u00e9 que les faits et gestes de Triple K l\u2019avaient secou\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9crit de fa\u00e7on relativement d\u00e9taill\u00e9e leurs cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9vastatrices sur son estime de soi et son bien-\u00eatre affectif. Il a dit avoir eu beaucoup de peine \u00e0 trouver un autre emploi, du fait qu\u2019il ne poss\u00e9dait pas de permis de conduire valide, et il a expliqu\u00e9 les s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res qui ont r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de cette situation.\n[78] Bien que M. Milano ait indiqu\u00e9 que le fait de perdre son emploi chez Triple K l\u2019avait plong\u00e9 dans une profonde d\u00e9pression, rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019il ait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un suivi m\u00e9dical relativement \u00e0 ce probl\u00e8me et il semble \u00eatre compl\u00e8tement r\u00e9tabli.\n[79] Au regard de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, il convient de verser \u00e0 M. Milano une indemnit\u00e9 de 10 000 $ pour compenser le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019il a subi.\nF. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [80] M. Milano demande \u00e9galement le versement d\u2019une somme de 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, compte tenu de ce qu\u2019il a appel\u00e9 la conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e de Triple K.\n[81] J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que Triple K a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Milano, en partie du moins parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. N\u00e9anmoins, le cas qui nous occupe semble \u00eatre un incident isol\u00e9. Triple K a fourni \u00e0 M. Milano une lettre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et l\u2019a autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au sein de la compagnie une semaine de plus que les deux semaines de pr\u00e9avis que M. Croft lui avait initialement accord\u00e9es. En outre, contrairement \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des employeurs r\u00e9gis par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, Triple K n\u2019est pas une vaste organisation. \u00c0 mon avis, au regard de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, une indemnit\u00e9 de 5 000 $ est appropri\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nG. Int\u00e9r\u00eats [82] Des int\u00e9r\u00eats sont payables sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale et l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au titre des pertes salariales15. J\u2019ordonne que des int\u00e9r\u00eats soient vers\u00e9s sur les sommes accord\u00e9es en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats courront \u00e0 compter du 23 f\u00e9vrier 2001 et, dans le cas des pertes salariales, devraient \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s en fonction des dates o\u00f9 le salaire aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Milano.\nH. Maintien de la comp\u00e9tence [83] Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour le cas o\u00f9 les parties ne seraient pas en mesure de s\u2019entendre sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation quantitative ou l\u2019application des mesures de redressement pr\u00e9vues dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nVI. Ordonnance [84] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, je d\u00e9clare que Triple K a contrevenu aux droits de M. Milano aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et j\u2019ordonne :\nque Triple K cesse d\u2019exercer une discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. J\u2019ordonne aussi que Triple K consulte la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi, afin d\u2019\u00e9laborer une politique sur l\u2019accommodement des employ\u00e9s atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Triple K doit, dans les trois mois suivant la publication de sa politique, dispenser \u00e0 ses cadres sup\u00e9rieurs une formation sur les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019application de celle\u2011ci ainsi que sur les obligations des employeurs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, y compris l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement;\nque M. Milano soit indemnis\u00e9 de ses pertes salariales, calcul\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision; que Triple K verse \u00e0 M. Milano un montant suffisant pour compenser l\u2019imp\u00f4t suppl\u00e9mentaire qu\u2019il aura \u00e0 payer du fait que les indemnit\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus lui seront vers\u00e9es sous forme de paiement forfaitaire; que Triple K verse \u00e0 M. Milano une indemnit\u00e9 de 10 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral; que Triple K verse \u00e0 M. Milano la somme de 5 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale; que des int\u00e9r\u00eats soient vers\u00e9s sur les pertes salariales et les indemnit\u00e9s non p\u00e9cuniaires accord\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision, aux termes de la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoire du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des pertes salariales commenceront \u00e0 courir le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2001 et seront calcul\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAnne Mactavish Pr\u00e9sidente\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 12 septembre 2003\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T732\/3702\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Victor Milano c.

Milano chez Triple K, son nombre d\u2019heures de travail au sein de la compagnie repr\u00e9sentait un peu plus du double de celui de M. Milano : 1 504 heures comparativement \u00e0 714 heures. En outre, il faut tenir compte de l\u2019affirmation faite par M. Cavanagh lors de son t\u00e9moignage, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il n\u2019a peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi productif que d\u2019autres m\u00e9caniciens au cours de ses dix mois en raison de son manque d\u2019exp\u00e9rience; par contraste, M. Milano a \u00e9t\u00e9 plong\u00e9 dans le feu de l\u2019action d\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e, \u00e9tant en mesure d\u2019accomplir n\u2019importe quel travail qu\u2019on lui confiait.\n10 La Commission a tent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir que M. Milano n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, en fait, la derni\u00e8re personne embauch\u00e9e dans le secteur de l\u2019entretien. S\u2019il est vrai que d\u2019autres personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019atelier d\u2019entretien de Triple K apr\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de M. Milano, aucune d\u2019elles n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e pour faire un travail semblable \u00e0 celui de M. Milano ou de M. Cavanagh. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis persuad\u00e9e que M. Milano a vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 le dernier m\u00e9canicien embauch\u00e9 par Triple K avant f\u00e9vrier 2001.\n11 Voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le Tribunal est saisi de deux questions pr\u00e9liminaires soulev\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9, TELUS Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., ( l'intim\u00e9 ) relativement \u00e0 une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 8 juillet 1999 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ( la Commission ) par le Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Section locale 5044 du Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( le plaignant ).\n[2] Dans sa plainte, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que les titulaires d'un poste \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9 font l'objet de discrimination de la part de ce dernier. Selon le plaignant, en ce faisant, l'intim\u00e9 contrevient \u00e0 l'article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ( la Loi ).\n[3] Les questions de l'intim\u00e9 portent sur les points suivants:\nL'intim\u00e9 soutient que certaines parties, dont entre autres le Syndicat des Agents de Ma\u00eetrise de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, section locale 5144 du Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( le SAQT ), doivent \u00eatre d\u00fbment convoqu\u00e9es dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent dossier compte tenu que leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats pourraient potentiellement \u00eatre directement affect\u00e9s selon les conclusions que le Tribunal pourrait rendre; L'intim\u00e9 soutient qu'il n'y avait pas suffisamment d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve justifiant la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de demander la constitution du pr\u00e9sent Tribunal.\n[4] Le 26 mars 2003, M. Athanasios D. Hadjis, membre du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, d\u00e9cidait que ces deux questions seraient trait\u00e9es par observations \u00e9crites. Le soussign\u00e9 fut d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour disposer de ces deux questions.\nII. LA PREMI\u00c8RE QUESTION [5] D'entr\u00e9e de jeu, il convient de souligner que la premi\u00e8re question de l'intim\u00e9 comporte plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments.\n[6] Premi\u00e8rement, l'intim\u00e9 demande que le SAQT soit d\u00fbment convoqu\u00e9 aux fins du pr\u00e9sent dossier (Plaidoiries \u00e9crites de l'intim\u00e9 du 15 avril 2003, par. 26). A cet \u00e9gard, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que le SAQT constitue une partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dont les droits pourraient \u00eatre affect\u00e9s par une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent dossier (Plaidoiries, par. 46). Cons\u00e9quemment, l'intim\u00e9 requiert que le SAQT soit avis\u00e9 que les d\u00e9cisions que le Tribunal pourrait rendre dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier sont susceptibles d'affecter ses droits afin de lui permettre de faire valoir sa d\u00e9fense ou son point de vue (Plaidoiries \u00e9crites, par. 47).\n[7] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l'intim\u00e9 plaide que, dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le Tribunal conclurait \u00e0 quelque discrimination que ce soit en rapport avec le pr\u00e9sent dossier, tant le plaignant que le SAQT devraient \u00eatre tenus responsables des dommages en tant qu'auteurs actifs et indispensables de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (Plaidoiries \u00e9crites, par. 38).\n[8] Selon l'intim\u00e9, l'\u00e9valuation de l'emploi en cause fut faite par un Comit\u00e9 conjoint permanent d'\u00e9valuation des occupations form\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants du plaignant, de l'intim\u00e9 et du SAQT (Plaidoiries \u00e9crites, par. 34); selon l'intim\u00e9, s'il y a discrimination, celle-ci r\u00e9sulte de la d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9, d\u00e9cision qui \u00e9tait finale et sans appel et liait l'intim\u00e9 (Plaidoiries \u00e9crites, par. 43).\n[9] En cons\u00e9quence, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que les repr\u00e9sentants du plaignant ainsi que ceux du SAQT ayant si\u00e9g\u00e9 sur le Comit\u00e9 conjoint charg\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuer les emplois en cause doivent \u00eatre tenus conjointement et solidairement responsables de tout d\u00e9dommagement que pourrait ordonner le Tribunal dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier (Plaidoiries \u00e9crites par. 44).\n[10] L'intim\u00e9 demande donc que le SAQT soit convoqu\u00e9 aux fins du pr\u00e9sent dossier par voie d'appel en garantie et ce, compte tenu de son r\u00f4le actif et indispensable \u00e0 la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, et soutient que sa pr\u00e9sence est n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre une solution compl\u00e8te du litige (Plaidoiries \u00e9crites, par. 51).\n[11] En r\u00e9ponse aux arguments de l'intim\u00e9, la Commission d\u00e9clare qu'elle ne prend pas position quant au fond de cette question. Elle demande toutefois que la tierce partie soit avis\u00e9e de l'objection pr\u00e9liminaire de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir faire des observations sur le fond de l'objection.\n[12] Quant au plaignant, il fait valoir que le Tribunal n'est nullement saisi d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le SAQT, que l'\u00e9valuation de l'emploi reli\u00e9 au SAQT, soit celui de repr\u00e9sentant PME, n'est nullement contest\u00e9e.\n[13] Par souci d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, le Tribunal a requis que le SAQT soit avis\u00e9 de la demande de convocation et de mise en cause formul\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 et soit invit\u00e9 \u00e0 soumettre ses observations au Tribunal. Le SAQT avait jusqu'au 4 ao\u00fbt 2003 pour formuler ses observations.\n[14] En date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal n'avait toujours pas re\u00e7u d'observations de la part du SAQT, malgr\u00e9 l'envoi d'une lettre de rappel. Le Tribunal est donc appel\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre sa d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question sur la base des observations formul\u00e9es par la Commission, le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9.\nIII. D\u00c9CISION SUR LA PREMI\u00c8RE QUESTION [15] En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re question, le Tribunal croit bon de souligner que la position de l'intim\u00e9 est quelque peu ambigu\u00eb. Dans un premier temps, l'intim\u00e9 demande que le SAQT soit d\u00fbment convoqu\u00e9, ce qui fut fait en l'esp\u00e8ce, afin de faire valoir son point de vue quant aux demandes formul\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit. Dans un second temps, l'intim\u00e9 demande que le SAQT soit appel\u00e9 en garantie.\n[16] Le Tribunal est d'avis que cette demande d'appel en garantie va bien au-del\u00e0 de l'envoi d'un avis de convocation et du respect des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle ou d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Elle vise \u00e0 faire du SAQT une partie \u00e0 l'instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal en tant qu'intim\u00e9 et non seulement comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e.\n[17] Au soutien de ses pr\u00e9tentions concernant la premi\u00e8re question, l'intim\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Renaud c. Board of School Trustees, School district no 23 (Central Okanagan) et le Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique, section local 523, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970.\n[18] Il convient de souligner que les faits de l'affaire Renaud sont sensiblement diff\u00e9rents de ceux de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Dans l'affaire Renaud, le plaignant avait port\u00e9 plainte tant contre l'employeur que contre son syndicat, ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Lors de l'audition de la plainte, le membre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 modifia la plainte dont il \u00e9tait saisi de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 inclure une plainte contre le syndicat fond\u00e9e sur un autre article de la Loi en plus de celle fond\u00e9e sur l'article initial de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 rendre la plainte initiale conforme \u00e0 la nature de l'instance. Le membre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 a justifi\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision par le fait que cette modification ne causerait aucun pr\u00e9judice au syndicat puisque celui-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 tout au long des proc\u00e9dures et avait particip\u00e9 pleinement \u00e0 la plainte initale, ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. La Cour supr\u00eame confirma le bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision du membre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour entendre la plainte.\n[19] La Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas comme tel de proc\u00e9dure pour l'adjonction forc\u00e9e de parties ou d'intervenants int\u00e9ress\u00e9s dans une instance devant le Tribunal. Tout au plus, la Loi pr\u00e9voit-elle au deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article 48.9 ce qui suit:\nLe pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal peut \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant, notamment :\n( )\nb) l'adjonction de parties ou d'intervenants \u00e0 l'affaire;\n( )\n[20] Par ailleurs, les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal \u00e9dictent ce qui suit sous la rubrique Adjonction de parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es:\nReconnaissance comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e\n8 (1) Une personne qui n'est pas une partie et qui souhaite \u00eatre reconnue par le membre instructeur comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une instruction peut pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate par \u00e9crit \u00e0 cet effet.\nMention des motifs dans la requ\u00eate\n8 (2) Toute requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 8 (1) doit pr\u00e9ciser les motifs invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui de la requ\u00eate en reconnaissance comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e et les modalit\u00e9s souhait\u00e9es de participation \u00e0 l'instruction.\n[21] \u00c0 la lecture m\u00eame de cette r\u00e8gle, on constate que celle-ci ne vise pas sp\u00e9cifiquement la mise en cause d'une tierce partie par l'une des parties aux proc\u00e9dures d'instruction d'une plainte devant le Tribunal, \u00e0 savoir le plaignant, la Commission ou l'intim\u00e9. Rien n'est dit, en outre, du pouvoir du Tribunal de faire droit \u00e0 un appel en garantie d'une tierce partie avec les effets juridiques que comporte une telle proc\u00e9dure.\n[22] Cela dit, si la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal peut \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant, notamment, l'adjonction de parties ou d'intervenants \u00e0 une affaire, il est logique de penser que le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence pour ajouter des parties \u00e0 une affaire donn\u00e9e. Pour l'heure, les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal ne comportent aucune disposition \u00e0 cet effet.\n[23] Dans une d\u00e9cision rendue sur le banc le 2 octobre 2002 dans la cause de Desormeaux c. OC Transport (T701\/0602), la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, qui \u00e9tait saisie d'une demande d'adjonction d'un syndicat comme intim\u00e9, statua qu'en vertu de l'article 50 de la Loi, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'ajouter des individus ou des groupes comme parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans le cadre d'une instruction. (Nous soulignons.) Toutefois, elle fit remarquer qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, telle n'\u00e9tait pas la question qui se posait \u00e0 elle, la question \u00e0 trancher \u00e9tant plut\u00f4t de savoir si une tierce partie (partie \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 la plainte) pouvait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme intim\u00e9 avec les cons\u00e9quences que cela pouvait avoir au niveau de sa responsabilit\u00e9.\n[24] Sur ce point, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal conclut, s'appuyant en cela sur l'article 48.9 (2)b) de la Loi, que l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait de conf\u00e9rer au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ajouter tant des parties que des intervenants \u00e0 une instance devant le Tribunal.\n[25] Par ailleurs, dans une d\u00e9cision subs\u00e9quente rendue sur le banc le 3 octobre 2002 dans la m\u00eame affaire Desormeaux, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal statua qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, les circonstances ne justifiaient pas l'ajout du syndicat comme intim\u00e9. Elle statua que, bien qu'ayant conclu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment que la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ajouter des parties \u00e0 une instance lorsque le Tribunal le juge appropri\u00e9, le contexte l\u00e9gislatif entourant ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire milite en faveur d'une certaine retenue ou prudence ( caution est le terme utilis\u00e9 par la pr\u00e9sidente).\n[26] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal souligne, fort \u00e0 propos \u00e0 notre avis, que la Loi pr\u00e9voit, dans le traitement des plaintes de discrimination, un processus d'enqu\u00eate et d'instruction fort \u00e9labor\u00e9 o\u00f9 tant la Commission que le Tribunal ont des r\u00f4les bien d\u00e9finis.\n[27] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal fait \u00e9tat du fait que l'ajout de parties en cours d'instance devant le Tribunal prive le nouvel intim\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de certains moyens de d\u00e9fense qu'il peut normalement faire valoir au stade de l'examen d'une plainte par la Commission, notamment de la possibilit\u00e9 de faire rejeter la plainte sans qu'il n'y ait besoin d'instituer une instruction devant le Tribunal, par exemple en raison du fait qu'elle fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai d'un an pr\u00e9vu par la Loi.\n[28] Par ailleurs, dans une d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal le 27 novembre 2002 dans Bozek et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. MCL Ryder Transport Inc. et McGill (T716\/2102 et T717\/2202), le Tribunal ordonna, \u00e0 la suite d'une requ\u00eate faite en ce sens par la Commission et le plaignant, que la plainte initiale soit modifi\u00e9e afin de substituer au nom de l'intim\u00e9 initial celui de la compagnie n\u00e9e de la fusion de l'intim\u00e9 initial avec un certain nombre d'autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[29] Consid\u00e9rant qu'il n'existe pas de r\u00e8gles formelles d\u00e9terminant les conditions en vertu desquelles le Tribunal peut ajouter un nouvel intim\u00e9, consid\u00e9rant, par ailleurs, que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'ajouter un nouvel intim\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal ayant en vertu de la Loi le pouvoir d'adopter des r\u00e8gles r\u00e9gissant l'adjonction de parties ou d'intervenants \u00e0 l'instance, il importe pour le Tribunal d'examiner les crit\u00e8res qui devraient guider ce dernier dans sa d\u00e9cision d'ajouter ou non un nouvel intim\u00e9 au stade de l'instruction de la plainte devant le Tribunal.\n[30] Le Tribunal est d'avis que l'adjonction forc\u00e9e d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 une fois que le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 d'instruire une plainte est appropri\u00e9e, en l'absence de r\u00e8gles formelles \u00e0 cet effet, s'il est \u00e9tabli que la pr\u00e9sence de cette nouvelle partie est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte dont il est saisi et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible une fois la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission que l'adjonction d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 serait n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte.\n[31] En l'esp\u00e8ce, les raisons invoqu\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 pour appeler en garantie le SAQT et faire en sorte qu'il devienne une partie \u00e0 l'instruction de la plainte et non seulement une partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e portent essentiellement sur le fait que deux de ses membres faisaient partie du Comit\u00e9 conjoint permanent d'\u00e9valuation des occupations (Plaidoiries \u00e9crites, par. 34 et 35) qui a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois en cause.\n[32] En lui-m\u00eame, ce fait n'indique nullement que les deux membres du SAQT engageaient la responsabilit\u00e9 de leur syndicat en participant au Comit\u00e9. En outre, rien dans la documentation soumise au Tribunal n'indique que ces membres ou le Comit\u00e9 ont ou auraient agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire dans l'\u00e9valuation des emplois.\n[33] Il convient de souligner, en outre, que le rapport de l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission soumis comme pi\u00e8ce par l'intim\u00e9 au soutien de ses pr\u00e9tentions ne fait nullement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au SAQT et \u00e0 son implication dans l'\u00e9valuation des emplois en cause.\n[34] Par ailleurs, le Tribunal ne peut ignorer le fait qu'\u00e0 toute fin pratique, l'adjonction d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 au stade de l'instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal, sans que celui-ci n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'une plainte formelle, prive ce nouvel intim\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de faire valoir certains moyens de d\u00e9fense devant la Commission en vertu des articles 41 et 44 de la Loi.\n[35] \u00c0 ce propos, il convient de souligner que les tribunaux ont r\u00e9cemment soulign\u00e9 l'importance de respecter l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale dans le traitement des plaintes de discrimination d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, notamment en ce qui a trait au droit de l'intim\u00e9 de contester \u00e0 ce stade initial le bien-fond\u00e9 d'une plainte (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. Barrette, [2000] 4 C.F. 145 (C.A.) et Judge c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada, [2002] A.C.F. no 426, (C.F. 1re inst.).\n[36] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas convaincu le Tribunal que la mise en cause forc\u00e9e du SAQT est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte telle que libell\u00e9e. En outre, le Tribunal est d'avis que la mise en cause du SAQT \u00e0 ce stade-ci serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 ce dernier d'un point de vue d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[37] Cela dit, il sera loisible \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de faire valoir au cours de l'instruction devant le Tribunal que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal ne justifie pas le maintien de la plainte et qu'il ne saurait \u00eatre tenu responsable ou enti\u00e8rement responsable de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans la plainte.\nIV. LA SECONDE QUESTION [38] En ce qui concerne la seconde question, l'intim\u00e9, s'appuyant en cela sur les articles 41 et 44 de la Loi, soutient que la Commission ne pouvait demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer, en application de l'article 49 de la Loi, un membre pour instruire la plainte pour les deux motifs expos\u00e9s comme suit dans ses plaidoiries \u00e9crites du 15 avril 2003:\nquant au premier motif, l'intim\u00e9, s'appuyant sur les faits relat\u00e9s tant au Rapport d'enqu\u00eate que dans la plainte, invoque que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai d'un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e, \u00e0 savoir l'attribution d'une cote d'\u00e9valuation diff\u00e9rente pour les Repr\u00e9sentant(e)s, service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le, affaires (BAR), par rapport aux Repr\u00e9sentant(e)s PME (PME); quant au second motif, l'intim\u00e9 s'appuie sur le fait que l'auteur du rapport d'enqu\u00eate recommande qu'en vertu de l'article 44(3)b) de la Loi que la Commission rejette la plainte pour diverses raisons.\n[39] L'intim\u00e9 conclut donc que la Commission aurait d\u00fb rejeter la plainte en vertu des articles 41 (1) c) \u00e0 e) de la Loi.\n[40] En r\u00e9ponse aux arguments de l'intim\u00e9, la Commission soutient que seule la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a comp\u00e9tence pour revoir les d\u00e9cisions prises par la Commission. Pour sa part, le plaignant dit partager le point de vue de la Commission.\n[41] Dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la position de la Commission, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que l'\u00e9conomie de la Loi milite en faveur de l'examen par le Tribunal de la suffisance de la preuve \u00e0 la base du renvoi de la plainte devant le Tribunal.\n[42] Selon l'intim\u00e9, le point de vue pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la Commission a pour effet de restreindre la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une plainte est fond\u00e9e ou non en vertu de la Loi (R\u00e9plique \u00e9crite de l'intim\u00e9, par. 25). D'une part, il porte atteinte \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'examiner s'il y avait suffisance ou non d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve justifiant la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte au Tribunal (R\u00e9plique, par. 26) et, d'autre part, restreint la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer si une plainte doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e ou non eu \u00e9gard aux motifs pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article 41 de la Loi (R\u00e9plique, par. 27).\n[43] De l'avis de l'intim\u00e9, le Tribunal a pleine comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9cider de la question soulev\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 l'insuffisance des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve justifiant l'instruction de la plainte. Au demeurant, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que cette question ne rel\u00e8ve pas \u00e0 ce stade-ci de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nV. D\u00c9CISION SUR LA SECONDE QUESTION [44] Le Tribunal entend examimer tour \u00e0 tour les arguments soulev\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l'expiration du d\u00e9lai pour l'examen de la plainte par la Commission et l'insuffisance de la preuve justifiant une instruction de la plainte devant le Tribunal.\nA. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif de la plainte [45] En vertu de l'article 41 (1) de la Loi, la Commission n'est pas tenue de statuer sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e hors d\u00e9lai. L'article 41 (1)e) de la Loi \u00e9dicte \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que:\n41. (1) Sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu'elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants:\n( )\ne) la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai d'un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e, ou de tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n[46] Cela dit, la Commission peut n\u00e9anmoins statuer sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e hors le d\u00e9lai d'un an pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'article 41 (1)e) de la Loi (International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Section maritime), section locale 400 c. Oster et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, [2002] 2 C.F. 430 (C.F. 1re Inst.)). En vertu de la Loi, la Commission n'est pas tenue de justifier sa d\u00e9cision. Ce n'est en effet que si la Commission d\u00e9cide de ne pas statuer sur une plainte au motif qu'elle est irrecevable en vertu de l'article 41 (1) de la Loi qu'il lui faut motiver sa d\u00e9cision par \u00e9crit aupr\u00e8s du plaignant, comme le pr\u00e9voit l'article 42 (1) de la Loi.\n[47] De toute \u00e9vidence, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission n'a pas jug\u00e9 la plainte irrecevable, ayant, dans un premier temps, charg\u00e9 une personne d'enqu\u00eater sur la plainte et, dans un second temps, l'ayant d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e au Tribunal. Cela dit, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte au Tribunal n'est pas motiv\u00e9e si l'on s'en rapporte \u00e0 la lettre achemin\u00e9e par la Commission \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 le 24 d\u00e9cembre 2002. Il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle le soit.\n[48] Le Tribunal est d'avis qu'il ne lui appartient pas de statuer sur les raisons qui ont pu amener la Commission \u00e0 d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la pr\u00e9sente plainte au Tribunal (Parisien et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, d\u00e9cision n 1, Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, 15 juillet 2002, par. 12). Le fait est que la Commission a effectivement d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal sans toutefois en donner formellement les raisons. Il s'ensuit que les raisons ayant amen\u00e9 la Commission \u00e0 saisir le Tribunal de la plainte malgr\u00e9 la recommandation \u00e0 l'effet contraire formul\u00e9e par l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission ne sont pas connues du Tribunal.\n[49] Quoi qu'il en soit, il semble bien \u00e9tabli en jurisprudence que la personne qui est l'objet d'une plainte qu'elle estime avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e hors d\u00e9lai peut soulever ce point devant la Commission. Tel que soulign\u00e9 par M. le juge D\u00e9cary de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. Barrette, [2000] 4 C.F. 145, par. 24,\n(e)n ce qui concerne les motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 41 (1)a) \u00e0 e), la personne contre qui une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dispose express\u00e9ment de deux occasions de les soulever: d'une part, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'examen pr\u00e9alable pr\u00e9liminaire pr\u00e9vu par l'article 41 et, d'autre part, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'examen pr\u00e9alable pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'article 44 (voir les alin\u00e9as 44 (2)a) et b) et les sous-alin\u00e9as 44 (3) a) (ii) et b)(ii).\n[50] En l'esp\u00e8ce, rien n'indique que l'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir devant la Commission ses pr\u00e9tentions quant au caract\u00e8re tardif de la plainte dont il \u00e9tait l'objet. L'intim\u00e9 avait cependant alors une double opportunit\u00e9 de le faire.\n[51] Par ailleurs, si l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas d'accord avec la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la pr\u00e9sente plainte au Tribunal, il pouvait faire une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Section maritime), section locale 400 c. Oster et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9), ce qui ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas. Les propos tenus par M. le juge Gibson dans l'arr\u00eat pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 au paragraphe 30 de la d\u00e9cision s'appliquent tout \u00e0 fait au pr\u00e9sent cas:\nAyant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas demander devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision discr\u00e9tionnaire par laquelle la Commission a prorog\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 41 (1)e) de la Loi, le syndicat ne pouvait tout simplement pas exercer l'autre recours qu'il a choisi, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il ne pouvait pas soulever devant le Tribunal les m\u00eames questions qu'il aurait pu soulever dans une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[52] Le Tribunal en vient donc \u00e0 la conclusion que les arguments de l'intim\u00e9 en ce qui concerne le d\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif de la plainte ne sont pas fond\u00e9s.\nB. L'insuffisance de la preuve [53] Il n'est pas sans int\u00e9r\u00eat pour disposer de cette question d'examiner le r\u00f4le et les pouvoirs de la Commission et du Tribunal en vertu de la Loi.\n1. Le r\u00f4le et les pouvoirs de la Commission [54] En vertu de l'article 41 de la Loi, la Commission est tenue de statuer sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie, sujet aux exceptions pr\u00e9vues aux sous-paragraphes a) \u00e0 e) du paragraphe (1) de l'article 41, tel que soulign\u00e9 par M. le juge D\u00e9cary de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'arr\u00eat Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. Barrette, [2000] 4 C.F. 145, par. 23:\nL'article 41 impose \u00e0 la Commission l'obligation de s'assurer, m\u00eame proprio motu, qu'une plainte m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre trait\u00e9e. De toute \u00e9vidence, il n'incombe \u00e0 la Commission aucune obligation de mener une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 ce stade-l\u00e0, et la Commission n'est tenue d'examiner que la question de savoir s'il y a, prima facie, des motifs fond\u00e9s sur le paragraphe 41 (1) et, dans l'affirmative, celle de savoir si elle doit tout de m\u00eame traiter la plainte.\n[55] En vertu de l'article 43 de la Loi, la Commission peut charger une personne d'enqu\u00eater sur une plainte. Cela dit, la Loi pr\u00e9voit en son article 49 que la Commission peut, \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci, que l'instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n[56] La Loi n'oblige aucunement la Commission \u00e0 motiver sa d\u00e9cision de demander qu'une plainte soit instruite devant le Tribunal. Tout au plus, la Loi requiert-elle en son article 42 que la Commission motive par \u00e9crit aupr\u00e8s d'un plaignant sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas statuer sur une plainte qu'elle consid\u00e8re, en vertu de la Loi, irrecevable.\n[57] Enfin, la Loi n'oblige pas la Commission \u00e0 suivre imp\u00e9rativement la recommandation de la personne charg\u00e9e d'enqu\u00eater sur une plainte en vertu de l'article 43 de la Loi. La Commission jouit, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, d'une large discr\u00e9tion. Suivant l'article 44 de la Loi, dans sa d\u00e9cision de demander au Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire une plainte vis\u00e9e par un rapport d'enqu\u00eate, la Commission doit tenir compte, non seulement du rapport d'enqu\u00eate, mais \u00e9galement des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte (having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, dans la version anglaise).\n2. Le r\u00f4le et les pouvoirs du Tribunal [58] Le r\u00f4le d\u00e9volu au Tribunal en vertu de la Loi a notamment \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme suit par M. le juge La Forest dans Cooper c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1996] 3 R.C.S. 854, par. 64:\nPris ensemble, les par. 50 (1) et 53 (2) de la Loi disposent qu'un tribunal examine l'objet de la plainte qui lui est d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Commission pour d\u00e9terminer si elle est fond\u00e9e. Il s'agit d'abord et avant tout d'une enqu\u00eate portant sur l'appr\u00e9ciation des faits, qui vise \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si oui ou non un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. Au cours d'une telle enqu\u00eate, un tribunal peut effectivement examiner des questions de droit.\n[59] Ainsi, en vertu de la Loi, le r\u00f4le du Tribunal consiste essentiellement \u00e0 instruire toute plainte qui lui est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Commission. En vertu de l'article 50 de la Loi, le Tribunal est habilet\u00e9 \u00e0 trancher les questions de droit et de fait se rapportant \u00e0 la plainte dont il est saisi. Dans le cadre de l'instruction men\u00e9e par le Tribunal, les parties ont la possibilit\u00e9 de faire valoir tous les arguments de fait et de droit au soutien de leurs pr\u00e9tentions.\n[60] Au terme de l'instruction de la plainte, le Tribunal peut, en vertu de l'article 53 de la Loi, soit accueillir la plainte, soit la rejeter eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la preuve qui aura \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et au droit applicable.\n[61] Ainsi donc, suivant l'\u00e9conomie de la Loi, il n'appartient pas au Tribunal dans le cadre de l'instruction d'une plainte de s'enqu\u00e9rir des motifs ayant justifi\u00e9 le renvoi de la plainte devant le Tribunal. Si un intim\u00e9 n'est pas d'accord avec la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer une plainte au Tribunal malgr\u00e9 une recommandation \u00e0 l'effet contraire d'un de ses enqu\u00eateurs, il lui faut alors s'adresser \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[62] Il n'appartient pas non plus au Tribunal de d\u00e9cider s'il y avait suffisance de preuve ou non justifiant l'instruction de la plainte devant le Tribunal. La question relative \u00e0 la suffisance de la preuve sera r\u00e9solue au terme de l'instruction de la plainte devant le Tribunal. Ce dernier devra alors d\u00e9terminer si la plainte, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et au droit applicable, devrait \u00eatre maintenue ou rejet\u00e9e. En cela, le Tribunal ne refuse pas d'exercer sa comp\u00e9tence. Il ne fait que respecter l'\u00e9conomie de la Loi et s'en tient exclusivement au r\u00f4le qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par celle-ci.\n[63] En derni\u00e8re analyse, les fins de la justice sont mieux servies si l'on respecte les r\u00f4les d\u00e9volus en vertu de la Loi \u00e0 la Commission et au Tribunal, ainsi que les moyens mis en place par le l\u00e9gislateur pour se pourvoir d'une d\u00e9cision dont on n'est pas satisfait.\n[64] Le Tribunal en vient donc \u00e0 la conclusion que les arguments de l'intim\u00e9 portant sur l'insuffisance de la preuve ne sont pas fond\u00e9s.\nVI. CONCLUSION [65] Pour les motifs ci-dessus exprim\u00e9s, le Tribunal en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que les arguments de l'intim\u00e9 quant aux deux questions pr\u00e9liminaires soumises au Tribunal ne sont pas fond\u00e9s. L'instruction de la plainte proc\u00e9dera donc comme pr\u00e9vu.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 15 septembre 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL N: T757\/0703\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE: Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Section locale 5044 du SCFP c.

Hadjis\n2003 TCDP 32\n2003\/10\/02\nTRADUCTION\nI. FAITS\nII. ANALYSE\nIII. AJOURNEMENT\n[1] L'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance confirmant que le cadre de la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal n'englobe pas tous les \u00e9v\u00e9nements dont il est fait mention dans le formulaire de plainte.\nI. FAITS [2] La plaignante est entr\u00e9e au service de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (la GRC) en 1985. Au milieu des ann\u00e9es 90, la GRC l'a affect\u00e9e \u00e0 la mission des Nations Unies \u00e0 Ha\u00efti \u00e0 titre d'agente de la Police civile de la Force des Nations Unies. La plaignante all\u00e8gue dans son formulaire de plainte en date du 27 juin 1996 que, durant son affectation \u00e0 Ha\u00efti en 1995, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'une mesure disciplinaire qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 son rapatriement pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 au Canada. Elle pr\u00e9tend que cette mesure a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en raison de la relation personnelle qu'elle a nou\u00e9e avec un autre agent de la Police civile de la Force des Nations Unies, affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la mission par la France. \u00c0 son retour au Canada, la GRC a institu\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate interne sur sa conduite. Elle all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment des agents de sexe masculin de la Police civile de la Force des Nations Unies qui se sont engag\u00e9s dans une relation du m\u00eame genre durant leur s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Ha\u00efti. Elle pr\u00e9tend qu'elle a fait l'objet d'un traitement discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur le sexe et la situation de famille (\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, elle \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re d'un enfant).\n[3] De l'avis de l'intim\u00e9e, tous les membres de la GRC affect\u00e9s \u00e0 la Police civile de la Force des Nations Unies sont \u00e0 l'emploi des Nations Unies (ONU) pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de leur affectation et sont soumis du point de vue professionnel aux r\u00e8gles et r\u00e8glements de l'ONU. En fait, les \u00c9tats membres des Nations Unies pr\u00eatent ces agents de police \u00e0 l'organisation \u00e0 la demande du Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'ONU. On s'attend \u00e0 ce que la conduite de ces personnes soit strictement conforme aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de l'ONU et \u00e0 ce qu'elles se soumettent dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions uniquement aux ordres de l'ONU, et non \u00e0 ceux de leur gouvernement ou de quelque autre autorit\u00e9. Lorsqu'ils sont affect\u00e9s \u00e0 de telles missions, les agents de la Police civile de la Force des Nations Unies rel\u00e8vent d'un commissaire de police qui est sous les ordres du repr\u00e9sentant sp\u00e9cial du Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour les fins de la mission. Le commissaire de police d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour la mission \u00e0 Ha\u00efti \u00e9tait un membre de la GRC. L'intim\u00e9e soutient que tout incident survenu alors que la plaignante travaillait pour le compte de l'ONU \u00e9chappe \u00e0 l'application de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) et que ni la Commission ni le Tribunal n'a comp\u00e9tence pour examiner les aspects de la plainte y aff\u00e9rents. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s avoir appris qu'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre elle, la GRC a fait part de cette position \u00e0 la Commission dans une lettre en date du 14 ao\u00fbt 1996 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Marie Wankham, l'enqu\u00eateuse de la CCDP charg\u00e9e de traiter la plainte.\n[4] Le 3 juin 1997, Mme Wankham a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la GRC une lettre indiquant que nous sommes d'avis que la Commission n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour faire enqu\u00eate sur l'aspect de la plainte relatif \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires qu'auraient commis du personnel de l'ONU. Cependant, elle a soulign\u00e9 que la Commission a le pouvoir d'\u00e9tudier les aspects de la plainte relatifs \u00e0 la conduite discriminatoire de la GRC qui se serait produite au Canada, soit plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la d\u00e9cision de la GRC d'instituer une enqu\u00eate interne sur la conduite de la plaignante, au moment de son rapatriement au Canada.\n[5] Au cours des ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi, l'enqu\u00eate de la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue en attendant que la plaignante ait \u00e9puis\u00e9 ses recours au sein de la GRC. La Commission a repris son enqu\u00eate par la suite. Le rapport d'une autre enqu\u00eateuse, Sylvie McNicoll, a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 le 8 octobre 2002. Dans ce rapport, la Commission r\u00e9it\u00e8re qu'elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les aspects de la plainte relatifs \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite discriminatoire de membres du personnel de l'ONU \u00e0 Ha\u00efti ne rel\u00e8vent pas de sa comp\u00e9tence. En outre, il est indiqu\u00e9 en caract\u00e8res gras que le rapport d'enqu\u00eate ne porte que sur les all\u00e9gations ayant rapport \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate interne men\u00e9e par la GRC au Canada.\n[6] Le 20 mars 2003, la pr\u00e9sidente de la Commission a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal pour l'informer que la Commission \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] convaincue, au regard de toutes les circonstances entourant la plainte, qu'une enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e. La lettre demandait, par cons\u00e9quent, d'instituer une enqu\u00eate sur la plainte. La lettre de renvoi ne pr\u00e9cise pas si un aspect quelconque de la plainte ne justifiait pas une enqu\u00eate ou \u00e9chappait \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission ou du Tribunal.\n[7] L'intim\u00e9e soutient qu'au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante lui a transmis son expos\u00e9 des questions de fait et de droit, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation (r\u00e8gle 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne), elle a constat\u00e9, \u00e0 son \u00e9tonnement, que la plaignante avait l'intention de produire des preuves sur les aspects de sa plainte portant sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus en Ha\u00efti. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate demandant une ordonnance confirmant que la seule question \u00e0 trancher par le Tribunal est la suivante : est-ce que la d\u00e9cision de la GRC d'instituer une enqu\u00eate interne au sujet de la plaignante \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur des motifs de distinction illicite et contrevenait \u00e0 la Loi?\n[8] Essentiellement, on me demande de d\u00e9terminer si les aspects de la plainte ayant trait \u00e0 la conduite discriminatoire qui serait survenue \u00e0 Ha\u00efti ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9s au Tribunal pour enqu\u00eate.\nII. ANALYSE [9] Il est \u00e9vident qu'\u00e0 diverses \u00e9tapes de l'enqu\u00eate de la Commission sur la plainte, enqu\u00eate qui s'est \u00e9chelonn\u00e9e sur plusieurs ann\u00e9es, certains repr\u00e9sentants de la Commission \u00e9taient d'avis que la CCDP n'avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour enqu\u00eater sur les aspects de la plainte relatifs \u00e0 la conduite de membres du personnel de l'ONU. Il semble qu'on ait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de la Commission leur avis avant que la lettre de Mme Wankham en date du 3 juin 1997 soit envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la GRC. En outre, l'avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Direction des services juridiques de la Commission a fourni un avis juridique \u00e9crit; toutefois, la Commission s'est abstenue de divulguer ce document, invoquant le secret professionnel de l'avocat.\n[10] L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la conduite de la Commission pr\u00e9alablement au renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal fait partie int\u00e9grante de la d\u00e9cision m\u00eame de renvoyer l'affaire. Elle soutient que la Commission avait en fait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en 1997 que seuls les aspects canadiens de la plainte justifiaient une enqu\u00eate, d\u00e9cision qui a maintenant un effet obligatoire pour la Commission. Les seuls aspects de la plainte qui pourraient subs\u00e9quemment \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9s au Tribunal sont ceux qui ont trait \u00e0 la conduite de la GRC \u00e0 la suite du rapatriement de la plaignante. La seule chose que l'intim\u00e9e demande actuellement au Tribunal, c'est de pr\u00e9ciser ou de confirmer que seul cet aspect plus restreint de la plainte a fait l'objet du renvoi.\n[11] La Commission n'est pas d'accord. L'avocat de la Commission a soutenu que l'intim\u00e9e demande en fait au Tribunal de r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer l'ensemble de la plainte pour enqu\u00eate. La lettre adress\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sidente de la Commission \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal \u00e9tait claire. Il y \u00e9tait demand\u00e9 de faire enqu\u00eate sur la plainte; aucune limite ni condition n'\u00e9tait fix\u00e9e. De plus, il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en tenant compte de [TRADUCTION] toutes les circonstances entourant la plainte. Ces circonstances, fait-on remarquer, ne se limitent pas \u00e0 la lettre de Mme Wankham et au rapport d'enqu\u00eate subs\u00e9quent, mais incluent \u00e9galement la correspondance dans laquelle la plaignante conteste les pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission. En outre, la Commission soutient que certains documents relatifs \u00e0 la mission de l'ONU \u00e0 Ha\u00efti incitent \u00e0 croire que les \u00c9tats membres conservaient leurs pouvoirs disciplinaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des agents de police qui \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s \u00e0 cette mission. La Commission avait \u00e9galement en main ces documents au moment o\u00f9 elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal. Si l'intim\u00e9e n'est pas d'accord avec la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, il lui est loisible de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant l'organisme comp\u00e9tent, soit la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[12] \u00c0 mon avis, il est \u00e9vident \u00e0 la lecture de la lettre de la pr\u00e9sidente de la Commission \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal que tous les aspects de la plainte, tels que formul\u00e9s dans le formulaire de plainte sign\u00e9 par la plaignante en 1996, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9s au Tribunal par la Commission. Je ne vois rien dans la lettre de la pr\u00e9sidente de la Commission qui permette de conclure qu'une partie seulement de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour enqu\u00eate. En outre, il ne faut pas perdre de vue le fait que, m\u00eame si la Commission est habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si une plainte doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal (par. 44(3) et art. 49 de la Loi), la plainte demeure celle de la plaignante et non celle de la Commission1. La plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce n'a jamais modifi\u00e9 sa plainte.\n[13] La requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e implique qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les conclusions d\u00e9j\u00e0 formul\u00e9es par la Commission quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la plainte, la CCDP n'est plus en mesure de renvoyer au Tribunal la plainte dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. La requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9quivaut donc \u00e0 demander au Tribunal d'aller au-del\u00e0 de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et de r\u00e9examiner celle-ci afin de d\u00e9terminer si la CCDP \u00e9tait habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 faire un tel renvoi. Le Tribunal n'exerce pas un tel pouvoir de surveillance ni sur les faits et gestes de la Commission ni sur ses d\u00e9cisions. Ce pouvoir est exclusivement du ressort de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale2, et ce m\u00eame dans les cas o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte va \u00e0 l'encontre des conclusions de son propre enqu\u00eateur3.\n[14] Pour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e. Je suis d'avis que tous les aspects de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante en 1996, y compris la conduite discriminatoire qui serait survenue en Ha\u00efti, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9s au Tribunal pour enqu\u00eate.\nIII. AJOURNEMENT [15] L'intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que si le Tribunal ne fait pas droit \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate d'ordonnance, l'audience sur la plainte soit ajourn\u00e9e afin de lui permettre de modifier les documents qu'elle doit divulguer. L'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate dans la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9but pr\u00e9vu de l'audience sur le fond de la plainte. La requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue devant le Tribunal le premier jour d'audience pr\u00e9vu, soit le 17 septembre 2003. Au cours de la journ\u00e9e, les parties ont convenu de reporter l'audience sur le fond de la plainte, pour des motifs qui, dans une large mesure, n'ont pas rapport \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. De nouvelles dates ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es en vue de la poursuite de l'audience durant une p\u00e9riode de trois semaines \u00e0 compter du 26 janvier 2004.\n[16] Si la plaignante et la Commission avaient insist\u00e9 pour que l'audience sur le fond de la plainte se tienne imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j'aurais certes fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en ajournement de l'intim\u00e9e. De toute \u00e9vidence, il y a eu une certaine confusion quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la plainte renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, et les hypoth\u00e8ses pos\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9e n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e0 mon avis d\u00e9raisonnables. En fait, dans ses plaidoiries \u00e9crites au sujet de la requ\u00eate, la Commission a consenti \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en ajournement de l'intim\u00e9e, affirmant qu'elle regrettait que l'intim\u00e9e ait \u00e9t\u00e9 induite en erreur par la d\u00e9cision de l'enqu\u00eateuse.\n[17] Cependant, j'estime que les quatre mois qui s'\u00e9couleront avant la reprise de l'audience sont un d\u00e9lai suffisant pour permettre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de modifier les documents qui doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s et de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 plaider l'affaire; aussi, je n'ordonne aucun nouvel ajournement. J'encourage les parties \u00e0 communiquer entre elles pour d\u00e9terminer les dates auxquelles auront lieu les divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires de documents et de renseignements, compte tenu des conclusions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Si les parties sont incapables de s'entendre, l'une ou l'autre doit communiquer avec le greffe du TCDP dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais afin qu'une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence ou une autre forme de r\u00e9union puisse \u00eatre organis\u00e9e avec le Tribunal.\nAthanasios D.

La plaignante, Lorraine Roch, et l'intim\u00e9, Ga\u00e9tan Maltais, n'ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun argument sur cette requ\u00eate.\n[3] Dans sa requ\u00eate l'intim\u00e9e, Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e, pr\u00e9tend qu'il n'y a, en l'esp\u00e8ce, aucun lien, ni de faits, ni de droit entre elle et la plaignante. Elle all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement n'avoir jamais cautionn\u00e9, permis, encourag\u00e9 ou tol\u00e9r\u00e9 les faits et gestes reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 Ga\u00e9tan Maltais. Elle pr\u00e9tend qu'il n'existe aucun lien de droit entre elle et Ga\u00e9tan Maltais. Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e argumente qu'aucun all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte ne lui reproche quoi que ce soit et qu'elle ne peut-\u00eatre tenu responsable, des faits et gestes ou de la conduite de Ga\u00e9tan Maltais m\u00eame si celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9e actionnaire, administrateur et officier de Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e.\n[4] Le Tribunal n'a pas \u00e0 ce stade des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 porter un jugement sur le bien fond\u00e9 ou non des all\u00e9gations de l'intim\u00e9e. L'objet de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est de d\u00e9cider s'il y a lieu de rejeter, de mani\u00e8re sommaire, la plainte contre Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e.\n[5] Pour bien comprendre la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'entendre ou non une telle requ\u00eate en irrecevabilit\u00e9, il faut s'en remettre au cadre l\u00e9gislatif de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne1 et, notamment, aux articles 41, 44, 49, 50 et 53. Ces dispositions pr\u00e9voient :\n41. (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that (a) the alleged victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complain relates ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available; (b)the complaint is one that could more appropriately be dealt with, initially or completely, according to a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament other than this Act; (c)the complaint is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission; (d) the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith; or (e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.\n[...]\n44. (1) An investigator shall, as soon as possible after the conclusion of an investigation submit to the Commission a report of the findings of the investigation...\n(3) On receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission\n(a) may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry under section 49 into the complaint to which the report related if the Commission is satisfied\n(i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted ...\n4) After receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission:\n(a) shall notify in writing the complainant and the person against whom the complaint was made of its action under subsection (2) or (3);\n[...]\n41.(1) Sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu'elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants : (a) la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de l'acte discriminatoire devrait \u00e9puiser d'abord les recours internes ou les proc\u00e9dures d'appel ou de r\u00e8glement des griefs quisont normalement ouverts ; (b) la plainte pourrait avantageusement \u00eatre instruite, dans un premier temps ou \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9tapes, selon des proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9vues par une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ; (c) la plainte n'est pas de sa comp\u00e9tence ; (d) la plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi ; (e) la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai d'un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e, ou de tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n[...]\n44. (1) L'enqu\u00eateur pr\u00e9sente son rapport \u00e0 la Commission le plus t\u00f4t possible apr\u00e8s la fin de l'enqu\u00eate.\n(3) Sur r\u00e9ception du rapport d'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe (1), la Commission ;\na) peut demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer, en application de l'article 49, un membre pour instruire la plainte vis\u00e9e par le rapport, si elle est convaincue ;\n(i) d'une part, que, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l'examen de celle-ci est justifi\u00e9,...\n4) Apr\u00e8s r\u00e9ception du rapport, la Commission :\n(a) informe par \u00e9crit les parties \u00e0 la plainte de la d\u00e9cision qu'elle a prise en vertu des paragraphes (2) ou (3) ;\n[...]\n49. (1) At any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n(2) On receipt of a request, the Chairperson shall institute an inquiry by assigning a member of the Tribunal to inquire into the complaint....\n[...]\n50. (1) After due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member...conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member...shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make presentations.\n[...]\n53. (1) At the conclusion of an inquiry, the member...conducting the inquiry shall dismiss the complaint if the member...finds that the complaint is not substantiated.\n(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member...finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member...may...make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice...\n[...]\n49. (1) La Commission peut, \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci, que l'instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n(2) Sur r\u00e9ception de la demande, le pr\u00e9sident d\u00e9signe un membre pour instruire la plainte.... [...]\n50. (1) Le membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n[...]\n53. (1) \u00c0 l'issue de l'instruction, le membre instructeur rejette la plainte qu'il juge non fond\u00e9e.\n2) \u00c0 l'issue de l'instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, ... ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire...\n[...]\n[6] La proc\u00e9dure, telle que d\u00e9crite par la Loi, pr\u00e9voit que la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu'elle estime que cette plainte est irrecevable, entre autres, parce qu'elle est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi. Si la Commission d\u00e9cide que la plainte est recevable, elle charge un enqu\u00eateur d'enqu\u00eater sur celle-ci.\n[7] L'enqu\u00eateur pr\u00e9sente son rapport \u00e0 la Commission le plus t\u00f4t possible apr\u00e8s la fin de l'enqu\u00eate. Sur r\u00e9ception du rapport, la Commission, si elle est convaincue que l'examen de la plainte est justifi\u00e9, peut demander \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte. La Commission informe par \u00e9crit les parties de la d\u00e9cision qu'elle a prise de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte au Tribunal.\n[8] Sur r\u00e9ception de la demande de la Commission, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal d\u00e9signe un membre pour instruire la plainte. Le membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission et aux parties, instruit la plainte en donnant aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. \u00c0 l'issue de l'instruction, le membre peut soit rejeter la plainte qu'il juge non fond\u00e9e ou \u00e9mettre une ordonnance conforme au paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi.\n[9] La requ\u00eate en irrecevabilit\u00e9, en l'esp\u00e8ce, demande au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance qui aurait pour effet d'annuler la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer pour instruction par le Tribunal la plainte contre l'intim\u00e9e. Comme nous venons de le voir, selon la Loi, c'est la Commission qui d\u00e9cide dans un premier temps si la plainte est recevable et qui apr\u00e8s l'examen du rapport de l'enqu\u00eateur d\u00e9cide si elle est justifi\u00e9e et, si tel est le cas, de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au Tribunal. Est-il loisible, \u00e0 ce stade-ci des proc\u00e9dure, pour le Tribunal d'interf\u00e9rer dans l'exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de la Commission ?\n[10] Dans l'affaire Eyerley c. Seaspan International Limited, rendue le 2 ao\u00fbt 2000, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, Anne Mactavish, d\u00e9clare au paragraphe 4 :\nIl n'appartient pas \u00e0 notre Tribunal de se pencher sur la comp\u00e9tence ou le comportement de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Ces questions rel\u00e8vent exclusivement de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n'ai point l'intention d'aborder la question de la contestation par Seaspan de la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission.\n[11] De m\u00eame, dans l'arr\u00eat International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Section maritime), section locale 400 c. Oster2, le juge Gibson avait ceci \u00e0 dire :\nPar cons\u00e9quent, je suis d'avis que le Tribunal a commis une erreur en disant qu'il avait comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires du syndicat, compte tenu de la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas demander devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision discr\u00e9tionnaire par laquelle la Commission a prorog\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la Loi, le syndicat ne pouvait tout simplement pas exercer l'autre recours qu'il a choisi, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il ne pouvait pas soulever devant le Tribunal les m\u00eames questions qu'il aurait pu soulever dans une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[12] En raison du cadre l\u00e9gislatif d\u00e9crit plus haut et de la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e, je suis d'avis que le Tribunal n'a pas la comp\u00e9tence requise pour entretenir la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e, Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e. Le recours appropri\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'intim\u00e9e de demander devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d'\u00eatre saisie de la plainte et de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au Tribunal. Une fois la d\u00e9cision prise de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte au Tribunal, le membre instructeur d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par la pr\u00e9sidente, instruira la plainte et donnera aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et leurs observations. Il tranchera ensuite les questions de droit et les questions de fait dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, y inclus la question \u00e0 savoir si l'intim\u00e9, Ga\u00e9tan Maltais, \u00e0 commis un acte discriminatoire et si cet acte, s'il est \u00e9tabli, a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis dans le cadre de son emploi, tel que prescrit au paragraphe 65(1) de la Loi. Encore dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait \u00e9tabli qu'un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis et que cet acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis dans le cadre de l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9 (Ga\u00e9tan Maltais), l'intim\u00e9e Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e pourra pr\u00e9senter de la preuve \u00e0 l'audience pour se soustraire \u00e0 l'application de ce paragraphe et, notamment, elle pourra pr\u00e9senter de la preuve pour \u00e9tablir les d\u00e9rogations pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 65(2).\n[13] La requ\u00eate en irrecevabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e, Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e, est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 22 octobre 2003\n1.

Ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de fait [1] En 1989, Nancy Green a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas obtenu d\u2019avancement au minist\u00e8re intim\u00e9, D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines Canada (DRHC), en raison d\u2019actes discriminatoires de la part des intim\u00e9s.\n[2] Apr\u00e8s avoir fait enqu\u00eate sur les all\u00e9gations, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, qui l\u2019a instruite. Le 26 juin 1998, le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision. Il a conclu que Mme Green avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019actes discriminatoires de la part des intim\u00e9s. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u00e9g\u00e8res modifications, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire effectu\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Section de premi\u00e8re instance).\n[3] La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal pr\u00e9voyait le versement de plusieurs indemnit\u00e9s.\n[4] En 2000, Mme Green a re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire pour compenser les pertes salariales subies entre 1989 et 2000. De plus, toujours en 2000, elle s\u2019est vu accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire afin de compenser le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019investir l\u2019argent qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb recevoir durant la p\u00e9riode 1989\u20112000.\n[5] Dans ses observations qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9es \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience sur les questions de fond, la Commission avait soutenu que \u2018 Nancy Green avait droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 major\u00e9e afin de tenir compte des cons\u00e9quences fiscales n\u00e9gatives qu\u2019entra\u00eene le fait de recevoir une somme forfaitaire... et qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 verser plus d\u2019imp\u00f4t qu\u2019elle en aurait pay\u00e9 si elle avait touch\u00e9 une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle de PM\u20116 depuis 1988\u2019.\n[6] Le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 les observations de Mme Green ainsi que celles de l\u2019avocat de la Commission, \u00e0 savoir que les mesures r\u00e9paratrices devraient r\u00e9sulter en une r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale. En d\u2019autres termes, Mme Green ne devrait pas, par suite des actes discriminatoires commis par les intim\u00e9s, \u00eatre dans une situation diff\u00e9rente de celle o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de ces actes.\n[7] Dans sa d\u00e9cision du 26 juin 1998, le Tribunal a \u00e9mis une ordonnance que les parties en arrivent \u00e0 un chiffre avec lequel Mme Green et le Minist\u00e8re sont d\u2019accord afin de tenir compte des cons\u00e9quences fiscales de la d\u00e9cision, le chiffre en question devant repr\u00e9senter la majoration. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un montant suppl\u00e9mentaire, non assujetti \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t, qui doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Green, une victime d\u2019actes discriminatoires, afin de compenser les cons\u00e9quences fiscales n\u00e9gatives des mesures r\u00e9paratrices.\n[8] Le Tribunal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il conservait sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question de la majoration pour le cas o\u00f9 les parties ne pourraient s\u2019entendre sur un montant acceptable. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties pourraient retourner devant le Tribunal pour lui demander que plus amples renseignements et d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soient accept\u00e9s par le Tribunal au sujet de la majoration et de la fa\u00e7on dont le montant qui y correspond a \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 pour tenir compte des cons\u00e9quences fiscales n\u00e9gatives des ordonnances correctives.\n[9] Mme Green a ult\u00e9rieurement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en ce sens. Le Tribunal a consacr\u00e9 plusieurs jours \u00e0 l\u2019audition de t\u00e9moignages en personne, y compris celui d\u2019un t\u00e9moin expert, et a re\u00e7u en preuve un certain nombre de pi\u00e8ces.\nII. La question \u00e0 d\u00e9battre [10] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Green, il est n\u00e9cessaire que [TRADUCTION] quelqu\u2019un [lui dise] qu\u2019on a tenu compte des cons\u00e9quences fiscales r\u00e9elles [des mesures r\u00e9paratrices]. Ayant re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire pour compenser le revenu perdu entre 1989 et 2000, ainsi que des int\u00e9r\u00eats et un ch\u00e8que (sans retenue d\u2019imp\u00f4t) qui portait la mention majoration et ne comportait aucune autre explication, Mme Green d\u00e9sirait savoir comment la majoration avait \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9e et si on avait tenu compte des cons\u00e9quences fiscales dans le calcul de celle\u2011ci. En outre, elle voulait savoir quelle m\u00e9thode les intim\u00e9s avaient suivie pour veiller \u00e0 ce que le calcul de la majoration se traduise par une r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale.\n[11] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la question qu\u2019il faut se poser est la suivante : Est\u2011ce que la majoration telle que d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s, a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien calcul\u00e9e et est suffisante pour compenser les cons\u00e9quences fiscales des mesures de redressement dont Mme Green a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 par suite des actes discriminatoires commis par les intim\u00e9s?\nIII. La preuve [12] Mme Green a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un certain nombre de sc\u00e9narios diff\u00e9rents montrant comment l\u2019ajout \u00e0 son revenu d\u2019emploi de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire et des int\u00e9r\u00eats adjug\u00e9s avait r\u00e9sult\u00e9 en une d\u00e9claration de revenus sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000. Les donn\u00e9es fiscales de base qu\u2019elle a fournies pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition ant\u00e9rieures ont confirm\u00e9 sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle elle recevait habituellement un petit remboursement d\u2019imp\u00f4t. Mme Green croyait qu\u2019il continuerait d\u2019en \u00eatre ainsi, compte tenu de l\u2019ordonnance corrective voulant qu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019une majoration afin de compenser les cons\u00e9quences fiscales des versements suite aux ordonnaces du Tribunal. Elle s\u2019attendait m\u00eame \u00e0 recevoir pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000 un remboursement d\u2019imp\u00f4t plus important que celui qu\u2019elle avait obtenu les ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures, du fait qu\u2019elle avait pu cotiser \u00e0 son REER une somme consid\u00e9rable.\n[13] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire accord\u00e9e par le Tribunal, Mme Green a cotis\u00e9 \u00e0 son r\u00e9gime enregistr\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9pargne-retraite un montant de pr\u00e8s de 30 000 $ \u2013 l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de ses droits de cotisation \u2013, car elle n\u2019avait pas vers\u00e9 les cotisations annuelles maximales entre 1989 et 2000. Compte tenu de ses cotisations fiscales ant\u00e9rieures, elle croyait que le transfert d\u2019une somme pareille \u00e0 son REER lui vaudrait une \u00e9conomie d\u2019imp\u00f4t consid\u00e9rable. Elle pr\u00e9voyait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000 d\u2019un remboursement d\u2019imp\u00f4t qui \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 environ la moiti\u00e9 de la somme cotis\u00e9e \u00e0 son REER, soit environ 15 000 $. Si on ne lui avait pas adjug\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats cette ann\u00e9e\u2011l\u00e0 (2000), son raisonnement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 valable. Le document qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve et qui montre les calculs (revenu d\u2019emploi, indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire, cotisation REER maximale, etc.) relatifs \u00e0 sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000 confirment sa pr\u00e9tention.\n[14] L\u2019ajout aux revenus d\u00e9clar\u00e9s par Mme Green pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000 des int\u00e9r\u00eats accord\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal de 1998 a modifi\u00e9 le tableau. Le versement des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 n\u2019a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 aucune retenue d\u2019imp\u00f4t. La Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu n\u2019exige pas qu\u2019on pr\u00e9l\u00e8ve l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur quelque paiement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats que ce soit. Par cons\u00e9quent, outre les maigres int\u00e9r\u00eats qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7us sur ses placements en 2000, Mme Green a obtenu un versement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats presque aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 que la somme cotis\u00e9e \u00e0 son REER. Le taux d\u2019imposition applicable \u00e0 ce revenu d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats imput\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000 s\u2019\u00e9tablissant \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 50 %, le remboursement de 50 % qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9vu en raison de la cotisation REER a presque compl\u00e8tement fondu.\n[15] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal, Mme Green a fait remarquer que si elle avait cotis\u00e9 chaque ann\u00e9e \u00e0 son REER le maximum entre 1989 et 2000, ses cotisations auraient cr\u00fb exponentiellement. Ces ann\u00e9es\u2011l\u00e0, les \u00e9pargnants qui ont fait des placements en actions dans le cadre de leur r\u00e9gime enregistr\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9pargne-retraite, o\u00f9 les gains ne deviennent imposables qu\u2019au moment du retrait de l\u2019argent, ont connu de tr\u00e8s bons rendements. Mme Green a rat\u00e9 cette occasion, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne disposait pas des sommes qu\u2019elle aurait normalement eu en sa possession si elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination.\n[16] Les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont tenu compte d\u2019aucune de ces cons\u00e9quences fiscales lorsqu\u2019ils ont calcul\u00e9 le montant correspondant \u00e0 la majoration en 2000. En fait, le calcul a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 avant que les intim\u00e9s ne soient mis au courant des d\u00e9tails relatifs \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de revenus de Mme Green pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000. Roger Dart, le directeur int\u00e9rimaire des Services financiers, R\u00e9gion de l\u2019Ontario, \u00e0 DRHC, et la personne \u00e0 laquelle Mme Green s\u2019est adress\u00e9e alors qu\u2019elle tentait de comprendre la fa\u00e7on dont la majoration avait \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9e, a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal que la majoration repr\u00e9sentait simplement la diff\u00e9rence en imp\u00f4t \u00e0 payer du fait que Mme Green a touch\u00e9 une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e, sous forme de placement forfaitaire, le revenu d\u2019emploi qui aurait normalement \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9parti sur une p\u00e9riode de onze ans. Bien qu\u2019il ait fait remarquer que la m\u00e9thode de calcul de la majoration en question n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute auparavant et qu\u2019on n\u2019avait pas song\u00e9 aux cons\u00e9quences fiscales de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, il a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que le calcul \u00e9tait conforme tout en s\u2019appuyant sur les meilleures estimations que son minist\u00e8re pouvait faire.\n[17] L\u2019expert financier de Mme Green, M. Brian Saxe, qui est comptable agr\u00e9\u00e9, \u00e9tait du m\u00eame avis. Selon l\u2019opinion d\u2019expert qu\u2019il a fournie, le calcul par les intim\u00e9s de la majoration repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Green a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 comme il se doit. Sa pr\u00e9occupation, \u00e0 titre de comptable pri\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les cons\u00e9quences fiscales de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire et des int\u00e9r\u00eats adjug\u00e9s, r\u00e9sidait dans le fait que Mme Green n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si le versement des int\u00e9r\u00eats avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chelonn\u00e9 sur une p\u00e9riode de onze ann\u00e9es plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00eatre fait au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e. \u00c0 son avis, on aurait d\u00fb utiliser une m\u00e9thode de calcul tenant compte des cons\u00e9quences fiscales n\u00e9gatives d\u00e9coulant du versement forfaitaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 Mme Green. Toutefois, il n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune m\u00e9thode de rechange qui aurait pu \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour calculer la majoration.\nIV. Conclusion [18] Le Tribunal est particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Roger Dart, jumel\u00e9 \u00e0 celui de Mme Green, indique qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas tenu compte des cons\u00e9quences fiscales des indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal de juin 1998.\n[19] Dans ses r\u00e9ponses aux questions sp\u00e9cifiques que lui a pos\u00e9es Mme Green en contre-interrogatoire, M. Dart a maintenu que le calcul de la majoration a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur le texte de la d\u00e9cision et sur certaines explications fournies par le minist\u00e8re de la Justice relativement \u00e0 son interpr\u00e9tation. Il a dit ne pas se souvenir d\u2019avoir discut\u00e9 des cons\u00e9quences fiscales. Il s\u2019agissait, selon lui, de d\u00e9terminer la fa\u00e7on de calculer la majoration proprement dite. [T\u00e9moignage de M. Dart, p. 33567.] Par ailleurs, Mme Green a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que DRHC n\u2019avait pas communiqu\u00e9 avec elle au sujet de la majoration.\n[20] L\u2019ordonnance initiale se lisait comme suit : ... que Nancy Green re\u00e7oive de son employeur une majoration l\u2019indemnisant des effets fiscaux n\u00e9gatifs attribuables \u00e0 la non-r\u00e9ception d\u2019un revenu annuel .... Cette majoration peut \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e par le service charg\u00e9 de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 la Commission de la fonction publique. Le tribunal conserve sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. S\u2019il est impossible d\u2019arriver \u00e0 un chiffre avec lequel Mme Green et le minist\u00e8re sont d\u2019accord, le tribunal entendra les observations \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[21] L\u2019ordonnance rendue pr\u00e9voyait que Mme Green et son minist\u00e8re devaient communiquer entre eux. Face au manque de communication, Mme Green a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait retourner devant le Tribunal pour lui pr\u00e9senter les renseignements que M. Dart a fournis lors de son t\u00e9moignage au sujet du calcul de la majoration.\n[22] La lacune qui \u00e9tait \u00e9vidente lors de l\u2019audience initiale du Tribunal semble avoir persist\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, il y a eu un manque \u00e9vident de communication entre les intim\u00e9s et leur employ\u00e9e, situation qui a engendr\u00e9 de la m\u00e9fiance et de la m\u00e9sentente. De toute \u00e9vidence, il continue d\u2019exister un froid entre Mme Green et les intim\u00e9s sur le plan de la communication. Cette lacune a \u00e9t\u00e9, et semble demeurer, la principale cause de l\u2019appr\u00e9hension de Mme Green et de ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 comprendre les motifs de son employeur. Cependant, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 ce moment\u2011ci comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur le manque persistant de communication. Certaines des ordonnances rendues par le Tribunal dans le cadre de sa d\u00e9cision de 1998 visaient \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ce probl\u00e8me.\n[23] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal au sujet du calcul de la majoration, il semble, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que le calcul effectu\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9s ait \u00e9t\u00e9 exact. Il ressort des t\u00e9moignages de M. Roger Dart et de l\u2019expert de Mme Green, M. Brian Saxe, que la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e tienne compte suffisamment et correctement des cons\u00e9quences fiscales du versement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire.\n[24] L\u2019adjudication d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats visait \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier au fait que Mme Green avait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de la possibilit\u00e9 de placer son argent par suite des actes discriminatoires qui l\u2019avait emp\u00each\u00e9e de continuer d\u2019occuper un poste de PM\u20116 et de conna\u00eetre une progression normale de carri\u00e8re dans la fonction publique. Aux termes de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un revenu d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats imposable l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 il est vers\u00e9. Mme Green a d\u00fb d\u00e9clarer ce revenu dans sa d\u00e9claration fiscale pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000. Sa pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019adjudication d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats veut que les int\u00e9r\u00eats fassent partie int\u00e9grante de la r\u00e9paration accord\u00e9e pour compenser les actes discriminatoires des intim\u00e9s et qu\u2019on n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb, par cons\u00e9quent, en tenir compte dans le calcul de la majoration.\n[25] Aucune explication n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie au Tribunal quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der. Bien que Mme Green ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un certain nombre de sc\u00e9narios, il existe \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard de nombreuses autres options possibles. Mme Green aurait-elle d\u00fb demander un \u00e9chelonnement du revenu d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats sur un certain nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es? Aurait\u2011elle d\u00fb demander que les d\u00e9clarations fiscales qu\u2019elle avait produites sur une certaine p\u00e9riode fassent l\u2019objet de r\u00e9\u00e9valuation de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 inclure une partie du revenu d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats dans chacune de celles\u2011ci?\n[26] Une question int\u00e9ressante se pose ici : est\u2011il possible de r\u00e9tablir la victime de l\u2019acte discriminatoire dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9? Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Dart a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne lui avait jamais expliqu\u00e9 la notion de r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale tout en faisant remarquer qu\u2019il ne la comprenait pas. Bien s\u00fbr, cette notion d\u00e9coule de l\u2019objet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, tel qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 2. La Loi vise \u00e0 lutter contre les pratiques discriminatoires et \u00e0 permettre de prendre des mesures pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ces pratiques afin que tous les individus aient droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement\u2026.\n[27] Dans le cas de Mme Green \u2013 comme dans la plupart des cas \u2013, cet objectif ne sera probablement jamais totalement atteint. Du point de vue financier, il est peu probable que Mme Green puisse conna\u00eetre une p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 le march\u00e9 des valeurs mobili\u00e8res sera similaire \u00e0 celui qui existait dans les ann\u00e9es 90. Elle a perdu \u00e0 jamais l\u2019occasion de faire des placements dans une p\u00e9riode aussi extraordinaire. Aucune m\u00e9thode de calcul ne saurait assurer une r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale dans ce sc\u00e9nario.\n[28] Les intim\u00e9s devraient\u2011ils \u00eatre responsables de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des int\u00e9r\u00eats adjug\u00e9s pour tenir compte des occasions de placement perdues par Mme Green? Si Mme Green avait fait durant la p\u00e9riode 1989\u20112000, en dehors de son REER, des placements qui lui auraient valu un taux de rendement correspondant exactement \u00e0 celui accord\u00e9 par le Tribunal (le taux des obligations d\u2019\u00e9pargne du Canada), il lui aurait fallu payer l\u2019imp\u00f4t exigible sur ces int\u00e9r\u00eats. Si elle avait fait durant cette p\u00e9riode des placements REER qui lui auraient procur\u00e9 le rendement des obligations d\u2019\u00e9pargne du Canada, le produit de ces placements serait impos\u00e9 incessamment au moment du retrait de l\u2019argent. Comment peut\u2011on dans le calcul de la majoration tenir compte de ces cons\u00e9quences fiscales hypoth\u00e9tiques? Cela est impossible dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Le Tribunal n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve donnant \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il existe une m\u00e9thode de rechange qui permettrait vraisemblablement de tenir compte, aux fins du calcul de la majoration, de toutes les cons\u00e9quences fiscales des mesures de redressement.\n[29] Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame si le Tribunal estime que le manque de communication et de participation des parties au calcul de la majoration est inacceptable, le calcul d\u00e9finitif de la majoration, tel qu\u2019effectu\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9s, est sans doute celui qui se rapproche le plus de l\u2019estimation raisonnable qui pouvait \u00eatre faite sans faire appel \u00e0 des raisonnements empiriques ou hypoth\u00e9tiques.\n[30] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que la majoration, telle que calcul\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s, constitue une r\u00e9ponse ad\u00e9quate au volet de la d\u00e9cision du 26 juin 1998 ordonnant de verser \u00e0 Mme Green une indemnit\u00e9 major\u00e9e afin de compenser les cons\u00e9quences fiscales des mesures de redressement.\nSign\u00e9e par\nElizabeth Leighton Pr\u00e9sidente\nSheila Devine Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 28 octobre 2003\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T447\/0296\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Nancy Green c.

INTRODUCTION\nII. CONCLUSION\n(i) DU TRIBUNAL : Le 30 octobre 2003 8\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le 4 novembre 2000, Marc Genest a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), contre son employeur, Bell Mobilit\u00e9 inc. (Bell Mobilit\u00e9).\n[2] Au bien-fond\u00e9 de sa plainte, Marc Genest soutient que son employeur a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en lui refusant le droit de souscrire \u00e0 une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint de m\u00eame sexe au m\u00eame titre que les conjoints de sexe diff\u00e9rent. Ainsi, il pr\u00e9tend que son employeur l'a trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en mati\u00e8re d'emploi en raison de son orientation sexuelle et de son \u00e9tat matrimonial contrairement \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[3] Le conjoint de fait du plaignant est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1998. Le plaignant n'a re\u00e7u aucune prestation d'assurance-vie suite \u00e0 ce d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\n[4] L'intim\u00e9e soumet au Tribunal une requ\u00eate pour rejet de la plainte de Marc Genest au motif qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e tardivement. \u00c0 l'appui de cette pr\u00e9tention, l'intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve l'application de l'article 41(1) de la Loi et son alin\u00e9a e) qui se lisent comme suit :\n41 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu'elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants:\ne) la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai d'un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e, ou de tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n[5] Le dernier des faits \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte est survenu lors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du conjoint du plaignant, soit le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1998, et la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 log\u00e9e le 4 novembre 2000.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9e estime que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai d'un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e.\n[7] Elle reproche \u00e0 la Commission d'avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de traiter la plainte m\u00eame si le plaignant ne lui a pas fourni d'explications ou de raisons justifiant qu'un d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 un an lui soit accord\u00e9 pour d\u00e9poser sa plainte.\n[8] L'intim\u00e9e demande donc au Tribunal de rejeter la plainte de Marc Genest parce qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e tardivement. La requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir si le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a comp\u00e9tence pour examiner et statuer sur les d\u00e9cisions prises par la Commission.\nL'affaire Vermette 1 fournit une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question.\nIl semble clair qu'un tribunal des droits de la personne n'a pas la comp\u00e9tence de revoir par voie judiciaire une d\u00e9cision de la Commission d'exercer sa discr\u00e9tion en vertu de l'article 41(1)e) de la Loi.\n[9] De plus, dans les d\u00e9cisions Oster 2 et Parisien 3, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement \u00e9tabli que seule la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a comp\u00e9tence pour surveiller les mesures et les d\u00e9cisions prises par la Commission.\nII. CONCLUSION [10] En cons\u00e9quence, la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRoger Doyon\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 30 octobre 2003\n1 Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c.

INTRODUCTION [1] Mich\u00e8le Laronde est la plaignante dans cette affaire. La compagnie intim\u00e9e, Warren Gibson Limited, est une grande entreprise de camionnage d'Alliston, en Ontario. Mme Laronde a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e comme conductrice de camions-tracteurs; elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 la section \u00c9tats-Unis, c'est-\u00e0-dire aux trajets aller-retour Canada-\u00c9tats-Unis. Elle a d\u00e9but\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein en stage probationnaire le 4 mai 1994 et a acquis sa permanence le 12 avril 1995. Les camions-tracteurs sont de gros v\u00e9hicules dont la cabine est dot\u00e9e d'une couchette \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re. Mme Laronde a travaill\u00e9 chez Gibson jusqu'au 2 octobre 1996, date o\u00f9 l'entreprise a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n[2] Avant sa cessation d'emploi, Mme Laronde avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en date du 23 ao\u00fbt 1996 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Dans sa plainte, Mme Laronde all\u00e9guait que Gibson avait, durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 son emploi, appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit des mesures disciplinaires plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res que celles prises \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de conducteurs de sexe masculin pour des incidents similaires et avait refus\u00e9 de lui accorder de l'avancement, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'art. 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Elle all\u00e9guait \u00e9galement que Gibson avait exerc\u00e9 envers elle une discrimination en ne lui offrant pas un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement, ce qui va \u00e0 l'encontre de l'art. 14 de la Loi.\nII. LES FAITS [3] Le si\u00e8ge de Gibson se trouve \u00e0 Alliston, en Ontario. Aux fins de ses activit\u00e9s de camionnage, la compagnie a cr\u00e9\u00e9 quatre sections : la section \u00c9tats-Unis, la section Windsor, la section locale et la section des suppl\u00e9ants. Les conducteurs de la section \u00c9tats-Unis font des trajets aller-retour entre Alliston et les \u00c9tats-Unis. Ceux de la section Windsor sont affect\u00e9s aux allers-retours entre Alliston et Windsor. Les conducteurs de la section locale font des trajets au Canada - habituellement dans un rayon de 100 milles. Enfin, ceux de la section des suppl\u00e9ants qui ne sont assign\u00e9s \u00e0 aucune des sections.\n[4] Au d\u00e9but, Gibson comptait environ cinq camions qui transportaient surtout du tabac, du ma\u00efs fourrager et d'autres produits agricoles. Lorsque Honda Canada a construit son usine d'assemblage pr\u00e8s d'Alliston, Gibson est devenue son principal transporteur de pi\u00e8ces d'automobile. Honda repr\u00e9sente actuellement environ 75 % du chiffre d'affaires de Gibson. Aujourd'hui, Gibson a un effectif d'environ 700 employ\u00e9s. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 Mme Laronde a travaill\u00e9 pour la compagnie, Gibson comptait quelque 250 conducteurs.\n[5] Les activit\u00e9s de Honda sont ax\u00e9es sur la livraison juste \u00e0 temps. L'usine d'assemblage de Honda n'est dot\u00e9e d'aucun entrep\u00f4t de pi\u00e8ces d'automobile. Les pi\u00e8ces sont transport\u00e9es \u00e0 l'usine dans des camions semi-remorque. Les remorques sont regroup\u00e9es dans une zone d\u00e9sign\u00e9e. Lorsqu'on a besoin de pi\u00e8ces sur la cha\u00eene de montage, on recule une remorque au quai de d\u00e9chargement. Les paniers de pi\u00e8ces sont descendus de la remorque et roul\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 la cha\u00eene de montage.\n[6] La livraison juste \u00e0 temps implique l'acheminement d'une remorque au client dans un intervalle de temps d\u00e9fini avec pr\u00e9cision qu'on appelle fen\u00eatre. Compte tenu de l'importance du concept de livraison juste \u00e0 temps pour ses clients, Gibson a adopt\u00e9 la devise \u00e0 temps, tout le temps, qu'elle r\u00e9p\u00e8te constamment, avec insistance, \u00e0 tous ses conducteurs. La r\u00e9ussite de Gibson est fond\u00e9e sur le respect de cette devise.\nA. R\u00c8GLES ET PROC\u00c9DURES DICIPLINAIRES DE GIBSON [7] Lorsque Mme Laronde est entr\u00e9e au service de Gibson en 1994, l'entreprise poss\u00e9dait un manuel de r\u00e8gles et r\u00e8glements qui \u00e9non\u00e7ait les normes et les attentes de la compagnie \u00e0 l'endroit de ses employ\u00e9s. Le manuel en question \u00e9tait remis \u00e0 chaque conducteur au moment de son embauche; de plus, un exemplaire se trouvait dans la salle des conducteurs. En juin 1995, Gibson a embauch\u00e9 Marilyn Lawrence comme gestionnaire, Ressources humaines. Peu apr\u00e8s son entr\u00e9e en fonctions, Mme Lawrence a modifi\u00e9 et mis \u00e0 jour le manuel de r\u00e8gles et de r\u00e8glements en y incorporant une proc\u00e9dure disciplinaire progressive, qui est entr\u00e9e en vigueur vers ao\u00fbt 1995.\n[8] En vertu de la proc\u00e9dure disciplinaire adopt\u00e9e, l'entreprise distingue trois cat\u00e9gories de manquements \u00e0 la discipline - inexcusables, graves et l\u00e9gers. \u00c0 chacune des cat\u00e9gories sont associ\u00e9s diff\u00e9rents types de comportement.\n[9] Les r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voient \u00e9galement une gradation dans les sanctions. Pour une faute inexcusable, la sanction est la suspension imm\u00e9diate sans solde, avec intention de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi. Dans le cas d'une premi\u00e8re faute grave, la sanction consiste en un avertissement \u00e9crit. Si l'employ\u00e9 fautif commet un deuxi\u00e8me manquement grave, il re\u00e7oit un dernier avertissement. Dans le cas d'une troisi\u00e8me infraction, la compagnie cong\u00e9die l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Les employ\u00e9s qui commettent des fautes l\u00e9g\u00e8res re\u00e7oivent un avertissement pr\u00e9liminaire, puis un avertissement \u00e9crit, un dernier avertissement \u00e9crit et un avis de cessation d'emploi.\n[10] Dans tous les cas, le r\u00e9partiteur et le gestionnaire, Ressources humaines, examinent le dossier de l'employ\u00e9 avant que la compagnie envoie un dernier avertissement \u00e9crit. Avant le cong\u00e9diement d'un employ\u00e9, les m\u00eames cadres proc\u00e8dent aussi \u00e0 un examen du dossier de celui-ci, mais ils doivent inclure un autre membre de la direction. Les circonstances att\u00e9nuantes sont prises en compte.\n[11] Outre ces cat\u00e9gories disciplinaires, il existe une classification des infractions concernant le carnet de route. Ces infractions sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme graves. Il n'est point n\u00e9cessaire ici d'entrer dans toutes les complexit\u00e9s entourant le carnet de route. Qu'il suffise de pr\u00e9ciser que la r\u00e9glementation gouvernementale, tant au Canada qu'aux \u00c9tats-Unis, exige que chaque conducteur tienne pour chaque trajet un carnet de route. L'heure de d\u00e9part, les p\u00e9riodes d'activit\u00e9 et d'inactivit\u00e9, la distance parcourue dans la journ\u00e9e ainsi que la date et l'heure du d\u00e9but du trajet sont autant de d\u00e9tails qui doivent \u00eatre consign\u00e9s dans le carnet de route. Le temps de conduite de m\u00eame que le temps de chargement et de d\u00e9chargement sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des p\u00e9riodes d'activit\u00e9. Le d\u00e9jeuner, le souper, les heures de sommeil et les autres p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 le conducteur n'est pas dans son camion, sauf le temps de chargement et de d\u00e9chargement, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des p\u00e9riodes d'inactivit\u00e9.\n[12] En vertu de la r\u00e9glementation canadienne, un conducteur peut demeurer au volant pendant 13 heures cons\u00e9cutives. Son temps de conduite et d'activit\u00e9 ne peut d\u00e9passer 15 heures. La r\u00e9glementation comporte une certaine souplesse en cas de congestion de la circulation ou de conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques particuli\u00e8rement mauvaises. Lorsqu'un conducteur a travaill\u00e9 durant 15 heures, il doit ensuite \u00eatre inactif pendant huit heures avant d'entreprendre un nouveau cycle de 15 heures. La r\u00e9glementation am\u00e9ricaine pr\u00e9voit un maximum de 10 heures de conduite cons\u00e9cutives et une p\u00e9riode maximale d'activit\u00e9 de 15 heures.\n[13] \u00c0 la fin de chaque trajet, le conducteur remet son carnet de route au service de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de Gibson qui produit pour chaque conducteur un relev\u00e9 informatique mensuel. Si le relev\u00e9 indique que le conducteur a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 le nombre d'heures admissibles, la compagnie l'en avise et le convoque \u00e0 une rencontre avec le directeur de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Si le conducteur ne peut fournir une explication raisonnable, il fait alors l'objet de mesures disciplinaires pour d\u00e9passement des heures admissibles ou infraction relative aux heures de service.\n[14] Par ailleurs, tout accident, \u00e9vitable ou non, est consign\u00e9 au dossier disciplinaire du conducteur. Les accidents \u00e9vitables ne sont pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des infractions \u00e0 proprement parler en vertu des r\u00e8gles. Leur traitement aux fins de la proc\u00e9dure disciplinaire n'est pas clair.\n[15] Apr\u00e8s un an, les manquements \u00e0 la discipline au dossier d'un employ\u00e9 sont annul\u00e9s et ne peuvent \u00eatre pris en compte \u00e0 des fins disciplinaires. Apr\u00e8s six mois, les infractions concernant le carnet de route sont annul\u00e9es.\nB. APPELS DEVANT LE COMIT\u00c9 DE GESTION [16] Si un conducteur ne respecte pas les r\u00e8gles et r\u00e8glements, son r\u00e9partiteur \u00e9tablit normalement un rapport d'incident (RI). Toutefois, n'importe quel employ\u00e9 qui occupe un poste de supervision ou de gestion chez Gibson peut r\u00e9diger un RI. Un tel rapport pr\u00e9cise la date et les d\u00e9tails de l'incident, le nom du conducteur, le nom de l'auteur du rapport, la nature du probl\u00e8me, la norme de la compagnie et le r\u00e8glement envisag\u00e9. Le conducteur peut r\u00e9pondre par \u00e9crit au RI ou fournir oralement sa version des faits. Le cas est soumis \u00e0 Mme Lawrence. Si le conducteur ne conteste pas le RI, Mme Lawrence classe l'incident dans la cat\u00e9gorie de manquements appropri\u00e9e, puis le consigne au dossier disciplinaire du conducteur.\n[17] Si le conducteur conteste le rapport, Mme Lawrence discute du contenu de celui-ci avec son auteur de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 bien comprendre la nature de l'incident. Si le RI se r\u00e9v\u00e8le sans fondement, l'incident n'est pas consign\u00e9 au dossier de l'employ\u00e9 et n'entra\u00eene pas de cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives.\n[18] Si Mme Lawrence en d\u00e9cide autrement, le conducteur est inform\u00e9 de la situation et peut faire appel devant le comit\u00e9 de gestion, qui se compose de repr\u00e9sentants de la direction et de repr\u00e9sentants des conducteurs - nomm\u00e9s par leurs pairs. Cependant, n'importe quel employ\u00e9 de la compagnie peut assister aux r\u00e9unions du comit\u00e9 de gestion et participer \u00e0 l'examen d'un incident ainsi qu'aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations portant sur les mesures \u00e0 prendre. Le comit\u00e9 de gestion se r\u00e9unit une fois par mois pour discuter d'affaires int\u00e9ressant la compagnie, y compris les appels. \u00c0 cette occasion, le comit\u00e9 peut, apr\u00e8s discussion, confirmer l'incident ou la sanction, renverser la d\u00e9cision prise ou substituer \u00e0 celle-ci une autre d\u00e9cision. La direction peut annuler une d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9; toutefois, selon Mme Lawrence, elle ne le fait que rarement. Chaque r\u00e9union du comit\u00e9 de gestion donne lieu \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction d'un compte rendu.\nC. LES TROIS \u00c9L\u00c9MENTS DE LA PLAINTE (i) Traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable - par. 7b) de la Loi [19] La Commission all\u00e8gue que Mme Laronde a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi, pr\u00e9cisant qu'elle a fait l'objet de mesures disciplinaires plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res que celles impos\u00e9es par Gibson \u00e0 des conducteurs de sexe masculin pour des incidents similaires. La Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves concernant dix incidents qui, \u00e0 son avis, confirment sa pr\u00e9tention.\na) Pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable 1. Le 12 juin 1995, retour \u00e0 la maison avec son camion - sanction : perte de la moiti\u00e9 de sa prime de rendement exemplaire [20] Le 12 juin 1995, Mme Laronde a fait l'objet d'un RI parce qu'elle \u00e9tait revenue \u00e0 la maison au volant de son camion, ce qui impliquait un trajet de 25 milles en dehors de l'itin\u00e9raire assign\u00e9. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Laronde a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle revenait de l'Ohio o\u00f9 elle avait re\u00e7u une contravention pour exc\u00e8s de vitesse. Elle \u00e9tait d'avis qu'une condamnation entacherait son dossier de conducteur et croyait avoir une bonne d\u00e9fense.\n[21] Mme Laronde devait retourner en Ohio afin de compara\u00eetre en cour \u00e0 11 h le lendemain. Elle n'avait pas le temps de se rendre \u00e0 Alliston pour y garer le camion, de revenir \u00e0 la maison, d'y prendre des v\u00eatements convenables pour sa comparution et de retourner en Ohio. Elle a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se rendre jusque chez elle dans son camion. Apr\u00e8s un arr\u00eat d'au plus cinq minutes \u00e0 la maison, elle a repris le volant et ramen\u00e9 le camion dans la cour chez Gibson, est mont\u00e9e dans sa voiture et a conduit pendant huit heures jusqu'en Ohio afin de se pr\u00e9senter en cour. Sa contravention pour exc\u00e8s de vitesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e.\n[22] Selon les r\u00e8gles, le fait pour un conducteur de conduire un camion jusqu'\u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une utilisation non autoris\u00e9e d'un v\u00e9hicule de la compagnie et comme un manquement inexcusable. Mme Laronde a interjet\u00e9 appel au comit\u00e9 de gestion, devant lequel elle a expliqu\u00e9 la situation. Le comit\u00e9 de gestion a recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 sa r\u00e9union du 28 juillet 1995 qu'elle ne soit pas sanctionn\u00e9e. Cependant, la direction a renvers\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9 et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de la priver de la prime de rendement exemplaire de 400 $ quelle devait recevoir en d\u00e9cembre. \u00c0 sa r\u00e9union du 11 ao\u00fbt 1995, le comit\u00e9 de gestion a r\u00e9duit la sanction \u00e0 200 $. La prime de rendement exemplaire (400 $) est remise deux fois l'an (en juillet et en d\u00e9cembre) aux conducteurs afin de souligner le bon travail qu'ils ont fait pour la compagnie.\nCas comparables\n[23] La Commission a compar\u00e9 cette sanction \u00e0 celles impos\u00e9es \u00e0 des conducteurs de sexe masculin de Gibson pour le m\u00eame manquement. Le compte rendu de la r\u00e9union du 8 mars 1994 du comit\u00e9 de gestion indique que Jim Barnes s'est rendu chez lui dans son camion, et ce, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 averti plusieurs fois qu'il ne pouvait faire cela. Il s'est vu imposer une amende de 50 $ (co\u00fbt du survoltage de la batterie du camion), montant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9duit de sa prime de rendement exemplaire. Dans le compte rendu de la r\u00e9union, on a insist\u00e9 par ailleurs sur le fait que la politique de la compagnie interdisait d'amener un camion \u00e0 la maison et que cette politique ne permettait aucune exception.\n[24] Bob Watt, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conducteur et directeur de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 chez Gibson, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Il a affirm\u00e9 que M. Barnes utilisait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement son camion pour revenir chez lui, qu'il continuait d'agir ainsi et qu'il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9 qu'une seule fois. M. Watt a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il avait fait la m\u00eame chose \u00e0 quelques reprises, sans jamais faire l'objet de mesures disciplinaires.\n[25] Charlie Ward a fait l'objet d'un RI en date du 21 mars 1996 pour avoir d\u00e9rog\u00e9 \u00e0 son itin\u00e9raire et fait un arr\u00eat chez lui. Il a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 de sa prime de rendement exemplaire de juin 1996 et a re\u00e7u un dernier avertissement pr\u00e9cisant que toute r\u00e9cidive donnerait lieu \u00e0 un renvoi imm\u00e9diat.\n[26] Don Smalley a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement conduit son camion pour revenir \u00e0 la maison et n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9. La compagnie a expliqu\u00e9 que M. Smalley r\u00e9sidait sur la route 89, soit celle que les conducteurs de Gibson doivent prendre lorsqu'ils commencent leurs trajets. Il semble que cette conduite \u00e9tait acceptable dans le cas de M. Smalley, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que celui-ci ne d\u00e9rogeait pas \u00e0 son itin\u00e9raire, et ce, m\u00eame s'il n'y avait aucune exception possible selon les r\u00e8gles.\n2. Le 15 ao\u00fbt 1995 - Itin\u00e9raire non suivi - manquement non sanctionn\u00e9 [27] Le 15 ao\u00fbt 1995, Mme Laronde roulait en direction nord sur la route 50 au volant d'un camion-remorque de 53 pieds de longueur. On lui a dit qu'un accident \u00e9tait survenu dans le village de Loretto et qu'il y avait l\u00e0 un bouchon de circulation. Pour contourner l'endroit, elle a pris le chemin du cinqui\u00e8me rang. En cours de route, elle a rencontr\u00e9 Bing Gibson, qui roulait en direction sud. Ils se sont tous deux arr\u00eat\u00e9s. Mme Laronde a expliqu\u00e9 la situation et a poursuivi sa route. Bing Gibson a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un RI \u00e0 propos de l'incident. Mme Laronde a fourni une explication. Aucune mesure disciplinaire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise.\n3. Le 9 mai 1996 - Hisan - plainte du client - note au dossier et excuses [28] Mme Laronde a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de cet incident qu'elle \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9e chez Hisan, un fabricant de pi\u00e8ces de Mt. Vernon, en Ohio, vers neuf heures. Elle a approch\u00e9 son camion du quai de chargement, est all\u00e9e voir Scott, l'exp\u00e9diteur-destinataire, pour obtenir les d\u00e9tails concernant son chargement ainsi que la documentation pertinente. Elle le connaissait, car elle s'\u00e9tait rendue \u00e0 Mt. Vernon \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Scott \u00e9tait en train de parler \u00e0 une autre employ\u00e9e (qui se trouvait \u00e0 \u00eatre sa femme). Apr\u00e8s quelques minutes d'attente, Mme Laronde, voulant attirer son attention, a pris le peigne qui sortait de la poche arri\u00e8re de son pantalon. Ayant remarqu\u00e9 qu'il avait deux \u00e9gratignures sur le bras, elle a dit beau travail en touchant celui-ci. Peu apr\u00e8s, Mme Laronde s'est rendue \u00e0 la d\u00eenette pour remplir sa documentation. La femme de Scott est entr\u00e9e dans la d\u00eenette elle aussi; elle l'aurait engueul\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de ce qu'elle avait fait. Mme Laronde estimait n'avoir rien fait de r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible et ne comprenait pas pourquoi cette employ\u00e9e de Hisan \u00e9tait aussi \u00e9nerv\u00e9e. Elle a rempli la documentation, quitt\u00e9 l'entreprise et t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lawrence pour signaler la chose.\n[29] Mme Lawrence a \u00e9galement re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de la part du gestionnaire, Ressources humaines, chez Hisan. Ce dernier lui a dit qu'un de ses chefs d'\u00e9quipe l'avait inform\u00e9 que Mme Laronde avait pris un peigne dans la poche arri\u00e8re du pantalon d'un employ\u00e9 de sexe masculin et lui avait caress\u00e9 le bras. L'incident avait \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9 au g\u00e9rant de l'usine qui avait demand\u00e9 que Mme Laronde ne revienne plus chez Hisan. Mme Lawrence a fourni \u00e0 son interlocuteur l'assurance que Gibson acquiescerait \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate et qu'elle recommanderait que Mme Laronde pr\u00e9sente des excuses \u00e0 toutes les parties en cause. Apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre entretenue avec Mme Laronde, Mme Lawrence a rappel\u00e9 le gestionnaire, Ressources humaines, pour lui dire qu'elle avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9e.\n[30] Mme Lawrence a class\u00e9 l'incident comme une faute grave. \u00c9tant fortement en d\u00e9saccord avec cette d\u00e9cision, Mme Laronde en a appel\u00e9 devant le comit\u00e9 de gestion. Mme Laronde a racont\u00e9 sa version des faits au comit\u00e9 de gestion \u00e0 sa r\u00e9union du 28 juin 1996. Le comit\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'une faute grave et qu'une note au dossier suffisait. Il a exig\u00e9 que Mme Laronde envoie une lettre d'excuses \u00e0 Hisan, ce qu'elle a fait.\nCas comparables\n[31] La Commission a demand\u00e9 que les mesures disciplinaires prises relativement \u00e0 l'incident Hisan soient compar\u00e9es \u00e0 celles impos\u00e9es \u00e0 des conducteurs de sexe masculin de Gibson pour des incidents similaires. Le 25 avril 1996, Brenda Mckee, de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Honda, a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lawrence pour lui indiquer qu'une employ\u00e9e s'\u00e9tait plainte du fait que chaque fois que David Cleary, l'un des conducteurs de Gibson, venait chez Honda, il se donnait du mal pour la trouver et la regardait fixement. Il ne lui parlait pas et n'avait aucun contact physique avec elle. Cependant, sa fa\u00e7on d'agir la mettait tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l'aise. Aussi a-t-elle d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de signaler la chose \u00e0 son chef d'\u00e9quipe, qui avait lui-m\u00eame observ\u00e9 le comportement de M. Cleary. Honda n'a pas demand\u00e9 que M. Cleary fasse l'objet de mesures disciplinaires ou ne retourne pas \u00e0 son usine, se contentant de signaler qu'un tel comportement \u00e9tait inacceptable.\n[32] Mme Lawrence a parl\u00e9 de la plainte \u00e0 M. Cleary qui lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'avait pas \u00e0 son avis caus\u00e9 de probl\u00e8me et qu'il avait tout simplement regard\u00e9 la cha\u00eene de montage. Mme Lawrence lui a dit que toute nouvelle plainte donnerait lieu \u00e0 des mesures disciplinaires. Il a convenu de cesser son man\u00e8ge. Il n'a pas eu \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des excuses.\n[33] Le deuxi\u00e8me incident cit\u00e9 par la Commission est le cas de HW, l'un des conducteurs de Gibson. HW a fait l'objet d'un RI en date du 20 janvier 1997 par suite d'une plainte \u00e9crite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une employ\u00e9e de la division des outils de Hillsdale. L'employ\u00e9e en question a dit qu'elle \u00e9tait offens\u00e9e par les remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes faites \u00e0 son endroit par HW. HW n'a pas ni\u00e9 avoir fait les remarques en question, pr\u00e9cisant que celles-ci avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es au cours d'une conversation entre lui-m\u00eame, la plaignante et sa coll\u00e8gue. Les remarques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 la blague et ne se voulaient pas offensantes. Le RI indique que HW avait \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eal\u00e9 \u00e0 cinq incidents ant\u00e9rieurs, dont les circonstances ne sont pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es dans la preuve. HW a d\u00fb faire parvenir \u00e0 la plaignante une lettre d'excuses et a re\u00e7u un dernier avertissement dans lequel il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que toute r\u00e9cidive donnerait lieu \u00e0 un renvoi imm\u00e9diat.\n[34] Le troisi\u00e8me incident mettait en cause RM, un autre conducteur de Gibson. Selon le RI en date du 14 juin 1995, Gibson a re\u00e7u une plainte de Harry, de Meiko Transport. La direction de MEI avait indiqu\u00e9 que RM s'\u00e9tait entretenu avec un garde de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'une voix tonitruante et qu'il s'\u00e9tait montr\u00e9 grossier et insolent. MEI a indiqu\u00e9 que Meiko devrait cesser de recourir aux services de camionnage de Gibson. Cette derni\u00e8re a jug\u00e9 que RM avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impoli \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un client. Mme Lawrence a rencontr\u00e9 RM, qui a perdu sa prime de rendement exemplaire.\n[35] Enfin, Scott McWilliams a fait l'objet d'un RI en date du 2 octobre 1996. Le RI ne d\u00e9crit pas les circonstances entourant l'incident. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. McWilliams manifestait des probl\u00e8mes de comportement. En outre, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eal\u00e9 \u00e0 trois incidents ant\u00e9rieurement. M. McWilliams a fait l'objet d'une suspension sans solde de deux semaines et a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en probation pour une p\u00e9riode de six mois au cours de laquelle il n'a pas touch\u00e9 la prime de rendement exemplaire. On lui a aussi servi un dernier avertissement.\n4. Le 6 juin 1996 - s'est lev\u00e9e tardivement - livraison en retard - faute grave [36] Le RI en date du 6 juin 1996 indique que Mme Laronde s'est r\u00e9veill\u00e9e tardivement et est arriv\u00e9e en retard \u00e0 Windsor pour un \u00e9change de remorques pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 sept heures. \u00c0 cause du retard, il avait fallu r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer le conducteur qui l'attendait \u00e0 Windsor pour son temps d'attente. Mme Laronde a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle revenait de l'Ohio avec un chargement destin\u00e9 \u00e0 Honda. Mme Laronde avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9e par le mauvais temps \u00e0 l'aller. Malgr\u00e9 cela, elle avait fait le trajet dans les d\u00e9lais. Toutefois, lorsqu'elle a entrepris le trajet de retour, elle avait atteint le nombre maximal d'heures. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s'arr\u00eater pour dormir durant deux heures. \u00c0 son r\u00e9veil, elle a constat\u00e9 qu'elle serait en retard pour l'\u00e9change des remorques \u00e0 Windsor. Elle a alors communiqu\u00e9 avec son r\u00e9partiteur pour lui indiquer qu'elle serait environ une heure en retard. L'\u00e9change s'est fait vers huit heures. Dans les faits, la remorque en provenance de l'Ohio a \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e chez Honda dans la fen\u00eatre de temps pr\u00e9vue.\n[37] L'incident a \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9 comme un manquement grave. Selon les r\u00e8gles, le manquement \u00e0 la discipline consistait \u00e0 avoir d\u00e9pass\u00e9 une fen\u00eatre de temps sans avoir fourni d'explication raisonnable. Mme Laronde a port\u00e9 l'affaire en appel devant le comit\u00e9 de gestion. Elle a fait valoir qu'elle avait respect\u00e9 la fen\u00eatre de temps puisque la remorque avait \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e \u00e0 temps chez Honda. Si le manquement avait trait \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de payer au conducteur son temps d'attente, sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9tait que le temps d'attente dans le cas des trajets aux \u00c9tats-Unis n'\u00e9tait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re heure.\n[38] \u00c0 sa r\u00e9union du 28 juin 1996, le comit\u00e9 de gestion a rejet\u00e9 son explication et confirm\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une infraction grave. Au dire de la compagnie, les r\u00e8gles n'\u00e9tablissaient pas de distinction dans le cas d'un \u00e9change de remorques. Selon Mme Lawrence, si Mme Laronde a fait l'objet de mesures disciplinaires, ce n'est pas parce que le conducteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 pour du temps d'attente. C'est plut\u00f4t parce que l'\u00e9change s'est fait en retard. Un retard est un retard.\nCas comparables\n[39] Selon la Commission, l'incident en question peut \u00eatre compar\u00e9 avec le cas de Mike Rumble, qui a fait l'objet d'un RI en date du 27 juin 1996. M. Rumble \u00e9tait parti trop tard dans la soir\u00e9e et n'avait pu respecter l'heure d'arriv\u00e9e, soit sept heures du matin. Aucune mesure disciplinaire ne lui avait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e. Le r\u00e9partiteur a soulign\u00e9 dans son RI que c'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que M. Rumble \u00e9tait m\u00eal\u00e9 \u00e0 un tel incident. Comme il ne s'agissait pas d'une plainte d'un client, l'incident devrait donner lieu simplement \u00e0 une note au dossier. Mme Lawrence a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle ne s'est pas pench\u00e9e sur ce cas du fait que c'est le r\u00e9partiteur qui s'en est occup\u00e9. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve et aucune explication n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e quant aux raisons pour lesquelles M. Rumble a quitt\u00e9 en retard et n'a pu respecter sa fen\u00eatre de temps.\n5. Le 18 juin 1996 - livraison tardive chez Honda - manquement grave [40] Le RI en date du 18 juin 1996 fait \u00e9tat d'une livraison tardive faite le 17 juin 1996 par Mme Laronde chez MEI aux \u00c9tats-Unis. La livraison \u00e9tait attendue avant neuf heures le lundi, mais Mme Laronde ne l'a faite qu'\u00e0 midi. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait inform\u00e9 le r\u00e9partiteur le vendredi pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qu'elle s'\u00e9tait bless\u00e9e au dos et d\u00e9sirait avoir le week-end pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer. Normalement, elle quittait en milieu de journ\u00e9e le dimanche pour entreprendre son prochain trajet. Son r\u00e9partiteur lui avait dit qu'il tenterait de lui trouver un chargement qui lui permettrait de partir plus tard le dimanche soir ou t\u00f4t le lundi matin. Cependant, lorsqu'elle s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au travail, on l'a affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un chargement multiple, c'est-\u00e0-dire un chargement destin\u00e9 \u00e0 trois clients ou plus. Le conducteur doit traiter avec un courtier en douane pour les marchandises de chaque client. Il faut alors plus de temps pour \u00e9tablir la documentation et d\u00e9douaner les marchandises. Mme Laronde a \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9e durant environ deux heures \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re, ce qui l'a emp\u00each\u00e9e de respecter sa fen\u00eatre de temps.\n[41] Mme Laronde n'en n'a pas appel\u00e9 au moment de cet incident, invoquant le fait qu'elle n'avait pas eu gain de cause lorsqu'elle avait la fois d'avant port\u00e9 en appel une d\u00e9cision concernant une livraison tardive.\n6. Le 28 juin 1996 - Dernier avertissement [42] Le 3 juillet 1996, Mme Laronde a re\u00e7u de la part de Mme Lawrence un dernier avertissement \u00e9crit en date du 28 juin 1996. Mme Lawrence a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que cette mesure avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par suite d'une accumulation d'incidents entre janvier et juin 1996 qui faisaient en sorte que le rendement global de Mme Laronde n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 la hauteur. Le 20 juin 1996, il y avait eu une rencontre entre Mme Laronde, Mme Lawrence et Willie Teigesser, son r\u00e9partiteur. Cette r\u00e9union avait pour but de souligner \u00e0 Mme Laronde qu'elle avait accumul\u00e9 durant une courte p\u00e9riode un certain nombre de manquements graves et qu'elle risquait de perdre son emploi. Mme Lawrence a per\u00e7u cette r\u00e9union comme une tentative pour aider Mme Laronde.\n[43] Mme Lawrence a d\u00e9crit les r\u00e9sultats de la r\u00e9union dans une note de service en date du 20 juin 1996. Dans cette note, elle pr\u00e9cise que le dossier disciplinaire de Mme Laronde fait \u00e9tat de quatre manquements graves et d'un accident \u00e9vitable. Elle fait \u00e9galement remarquer que la politique de la compagnie pr\u00e9voit qu'un employ\u00e9 peut \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 apr\u00e8s trois accidents graves; toutefois, avant de prendre une telle mesure, Mme Lawrence s'est sentie oblig\u00e9e de faire prendre conscience \u00e0 Mme Laronde de l'\u00e9tat de son dossier.\n[44] Lors de la rencontre du 20 juin, Mme Laronde a dit \u00e0 Mme Lawrence qu'elle contestait deux des infractions, soit celle du 9 mai 1996 chez Hisan et celle du 6 juin 1996 (livraison tardive parce qu'elle s'\u00e9tait lev\u00e9e en retard) et qu'elle avait port\u00e9 les deux cas en appel devant le comit\u00e9 de gestion dont la r\u00e9union \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue le 28 juin 1996.\n[45] Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, le comit\u00e9 de gestion, \u00e0 sa r\u00e9union, a minimis\u00e9 la gravit\u00e9 de l'incident Hisan. Selon le comit\u00e9, il ne s'agissait pas d'un incident grave et une note au dossier suffisait. Cependant, le comit\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 que l'autre incident (celui de la livraison tardive du 6 juin 1996) \u00e9tait grave. Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsque la lettre tenant lieu de dernier avertissement lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e le 28 juin 1996, Mme Lawrence avait \u00e0 son dossier trois infractions et un accident \u00e9vitable. L'un des manquements graves - l'infraction du 31 janvier 1996 concernant les heures de service pour laquelle aucune explication ni preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie) a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 du dossier disciplinaire de Mme Laronde deux jours plus tard, soit le 30 juin 1996. Par cons\u00e9quent, si je ne m'abuse, Mme Laronde, au moment o\u00f9 elle a vraiment re\u00e7u le dernier avertissement le 3 juillet 1996, avait \u00e0 son dossier deux infractions graves et un accident \u00e9vitable.\nCas comparables\n[46] Selon la Commission, le dernier avertissement re\u00e7u par Mme Laronde, comparativement aux mesures disciplinaires dont a fait l'objet Steve Semple, l'un des conducteurs de Gibson, est un autre exemple qui d\u00e9montre le traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable auquel elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise de la part de Gibson.\n[47] Le 13 avril 1996, M. Semple et Bill Grange, un autre conducteur de Gibson, voyageaient en tandem, chacun au volant d'un camion de Gibson. Ils sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s pour le repas du midi, au cours duquel ils ont consomm\u00e9 de l'alcool. Selon les r\u00e8gles, le fait pour un conducteur d'\u00eatre sous l'influence de l'alcool ou de consommer de l'alcool dans les huit heures qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent la conduite d'un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur constitue une faute inexcusable. M. Grange a eu un accident; les dommages \u00e0 son camion se sont \u00e9lev\u00e9s \u00e0 environ 100 000 $.\n[48] Les deux conducteurs ont d'abord ni\u00e9 avoir bu. Toutefois, un autre employ\u00e9 de Gibson a signal\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la compagnie que l'un des camions avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vu gar\u00e9 pr\u00e8s d'un bar, et non pr\u00e8s d'un restaurant Kentucky Fried Chicken, comme l'avaient pr\u00e9tendu les deux conducteurs.\n[49] \u00c0 la r\u00e9union du 26 avril 1996 du comit\u00e9 de gestion, M. Semple a admis qu'il a avait bu et qu'il avait menti au sujet de l'incident. M. Semple avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l'objet d'une suspension sans solde de deux semaines et le comit\u00e9 de gestion lui a inflig\u00e9 une autre suspension sans solde d'une semaine. La compagnie lui a \u00e9galement servi un dernier avertissement pr\u00e9cisant que toute nouvelle infraction grave entra\u00eenerait aussit\u00f4t son renvoi.\n[50] Mme Lawrence a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que si M. Semple n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9, c'\u00e9tait parce qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans l'accident. Bien qu'il ait d'abord menti, il a ensuite chang\u00e9 d'attitude et admis qu'il avait d\u00e9rog\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle des huit heures concernant la consommation d'alcool. Selon Mme Lawrence, c'est la seule r\u00e8gle de la compagnie qu'il avait transgress\u00e9e.\n[51] Outre l'incident de consommation d'alcool - une faute inexcusable, le dossier disciplinaire de M. Semple fait \u00e9tat d'une contravention pour exc\u00e8s de vitesse (96\/80) d\u00e9livr\u00e9e le 6 juin 1995 - une infraction grave. Il fait \u00e9galement \u00e9tat d'une infraction relative aux heures de service survenue le 31 janvier 1996 (infraction grave) ainsi que d'une infraction concernant une exp\u00e9dition sous douane en date du 11 mars 1996. Les r\u00e8gles de la compagnie n'indiquent pas clairement dans quelle cat\u00e9gorie cette derni\u00e8re infraction doit \u00eatre class\u00e9e.\n[52] Le 23 juillet 1996, Mme Laronde a re\u00e7u deux avis d'infraction portant sur les heures de service. Cependant, ces avis font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des incidents survenus les 13 mai 1996 et 6 juin 1996. Comme le service de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9tait en retard dans son travail, ces avis d'infraction n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis que vers la fin de juillet.\n[53] Par cons\u00e9quent, le 23 juillet 1996, Mme Laronde avait accumul\u00e9 quatre infractions graves. Les r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voient dans un tel cas le renvoi de l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Toutefois, Mme Laronde n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Selon Mme Lawrence, les avis ne pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie du dernier avertissement du fait qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis en retard.\n[54] Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 quant aux circonstances entourant les infractions des 13 mai 1996 et 6 juin 1996 concernant le d\u00e9passement des heures admissibles. Mme Laronde aurait pu faire appel dans ces cas-l\u00e0, mais elle ne l'a pas fait. Elle a par ailleurs refus\u00e9 d'accuser r\u00e9ception des avis.\n7. Le 25 juillet 1996 - livraison en retard - pas d'infraction disciplinaire [55] Le r\u00e9partiteur de Mme Laronde a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re d'aller chercher un conteneur pour transport en chemin de fer \u00e0 Welland, de le livrer \u00e0 destination et de se pr\u00e9senter chez JCI, un client de Gibson, \u00e0 8 h. JCI a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au r\u00e9partiteur \u00e0 8 h 45 pour l'informer que Mme Laronde n'\u00e9tait pas encore arriv\u00e9e. Un RI a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 propos du retard; Mme Laronde a expliqu\u00e9 qu'en raison des heures \u00e0 son carnet de route, elle ne pouvait quitter suffisamment t\u00f4t pour prendre livraison du conteneur \u00e0 Welland et se pr\u00e9senter chez JCI d\u00e8s 8 h. Son explication a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e. Aucune sanction disciplinaire ne lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e.\n8. Le 2 ao\u00fbt 1996 - impolie envers le r\u00e9partiteur - infraction l\u00e9g\u00e8re et excuses [56] L'incident suivant a trait au RI du 2 ao\u00fbt 1996 \u00e9tabli par Willie Teigesser, le r\u00e9partiteur de Mme Laronde. D'apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9tails consign\u00e9s au RI, Mme Laronde \u00e9tait de mauvaise humeur ce jour-l\u00e0 \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e dans la cour chez Gibson. Elle aurait alors cri\u00e9 et pest\u00e9 contre M. Teigesser et n'aurait pas fait une livraison chez Honda.\n[57] Mme Laronde a expliqu\u00e9 qu'on l'avait d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9e chez JCI \u00e0 Mississauga. Elle est arriv\u00e9e dans la cour chez Gibson vers 5 h 30, a quitt\u00e9 peu de temps apr\u00e8s et s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e chez JCI vers 7 h. Elle s'attendait de passer la journ\u00e9e \u00e0 transporter des remorques destin\u00e9es \u00e0 l'entrep\u00f4t de JCI; toutefois, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question qu'elle doive se rendre \u00e0 Welland pour aller chercher un conteneur \u00e0 livrer chez Honda. Il faut cinq heures pour se rendre de Mississauga \u00e0 Welland puis \u00e0 Alliston. Comme il s'agissait d'un long week-end, il lui faudrait probablement plus de temps.\n[58] Mme Laronde a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9e \u00e0 Welland plus tard au cours de la journ\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s avoir protest\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les personnes qui auraient pu intervenir chez Gibson, elle a finalement fait le trajet, craignant d'\u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9e pour refus de prendre un chargement si elle ne le faisait pas.\n[59] Au moment o\u00f9 elle est finalement arriv\u00e9e avec le conteneur dans la cour chez Gibson, elle avait effectu\u00e9 environ dix-sept heures de travail depuis qu'elle avait commenc\u00e9 sa journ\u00e9e le matin chez JCI. Le conteneur devait \u00eatre livr\u00e9 \u00e0 Honda, dont l'usine se trouvait \u00e0 trois kilom\u00e8tres. Il lui fallait livrer le conteneur, puis aller faire le plein et laver le camion avant de le garer \u00e0 sa place. Mme Laronde a gar\u00e9 le camion avec le conteneur toujours attach\u00e9 \u00e0 la remorque, puis est entr\u00e9e dans le bureau o\u00f9 se trouvait M. Teigesser, a lanc\u00e9 la documentation sur son pupitre devant lui et lui a dit [TRADUCTION] Le maudit conteneur auquel tu tiens tant est au bout de la cour, puis a quitt\u00e9.\n[60] Mme Laronde a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 la compagnie ce jour-l\u00e0 pour expliquer ce qu'elle avait fait et a port\u00e9 l'affaire en appel devant le comit\u00e9 de gestion. \u00c0 sa r\u00e9union du 30 ao\u00fbt 1995, le comit\u00e9 de gestion a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer l'incident comme une infraction l\u00e9g\u00e8re, mais que Mme Laronde devait pr\u00e9senter des excuses \u00e0 son r\u00e9partiteur, ce qu'elle a fait. L'accusation selon laquelle elle n'avait pas achev\u00e9 une t\u00e2che qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9e, ce qui aurait constitu\u00e9 une infraction grave, a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e.\n9. Le 18 septembre 1996 - mauvaise attitude - pas d'infraction disciplinaire [61] Mme Laronde a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9e \u00e0 London o\u00f9 elle devait livrer une remorque \u00e0 destination des \u00c9tats-Unis et en prendre une autre en provenance de l\u00e0-bas. Lorsqu'elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 London, le chauffeur qui venait des \u00c9tats-Unis avait d\u00e9croch\u00e9 la remorque et s'\u00e9tait endormi. Selon Mme Laronde, il existe entre les conducteurs une convention tacite voulant qu'on ne r\u00e9veille pas un coll\u00e8gue qui dort; par cons\u00e9quent, elle n'a pas eu l'occasion de parler \u00e0 celui-ci. Elle s'est rendue jusque dans la cour \u00e0 Alliston, y a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la remorque et a laiss\u00e9 une note au bureau demandant au r\u00e9partiteur d'indiquer \u00e0 l'autre conducteur o\u00f9 elle avait laiss\u00e9 la documentation concernant la remorque tout en lui rappelant de v\u00e9rifier le poids de celle-ci. Jugeant qu'il appartenait au conducteur, et non \u00e0 lui, de s'occuper de ces choses-l\u00e0, le r\u00e9partiteur a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir un RI. Mme Laronde a fourni une explication. L'incident n'a pas eu de suite.\n10. Le 27 septembre 1996 - omission de v\u00e9rifier un chargement - infraction grave [62] Cette infraction a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite comme l'incident culminant qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 le renvoi de Mme Laronde. Le 27 septembre 1996, Mme Laronde a fait l'objet d'un RI pour avoir omis de v\u00e9rifier un chargement (infraction grave). Le RI pr\u00e9cisait qu'elle n'avait pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 si la remorque \u00e9tait vide ou contenait des paniers vides.\n[63] Selon la version de Mme Laronde, on l'avait envoy\u00e9e chez SPS pour aller chercher une remorque et la livrer chez Manchester Plastics. \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e chez SPS, il pleuvait et ventait beaucoup et le sol \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s boueux. Elle n'avait pas envie d'ouvrir la porte arri\u00e8re de la remorque en raison des conditions climatiques particuli\u00e8rement dangereuses. Le r\u00e9partiteur lui avait demand\u00e9 d'aller chercher la remorque no 554 - vide ou charg\u00e9e de paniers vides. Il lui avait \u00e9galement dit que si le num\u00e9ro de la remorque ne correspondait pas \u00e0 celui indiqu\u00e9 ou si celle-ci ne contenait pas de paniers, elle devait voir l'exp\u00e9ditionnaire chez SPS et lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner pour obtenir de plus amples instructions.\n[64] Mme Laronde n'a pas ouvert la porte de la remorque pour voir ce qu'elle contenait. Elle est plut\u00f4t entr\u00e9e dans le bureau de SPS et parl\u00e9 au superviseur, qui lui a dit que la remorque no 554 \u00e9tait vide, qu'il n'y avait pas de documentation indiquant qu'elle contenait un chargement et qu'elle \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e \u00e0 Manchester Plastics. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Laronde a livr\u00e9 la remorque \u00e0 Manchester Plastics.\n[65] Lorsqu'elle est arriv\u00e9e chez Manchester Plastics et a ouvert la porte de la remorque, Mme Laronde a constat\u00e9 que celle-ci n'\u00e9tait pas vide mais renfermait des conteneurs vides. Elle a signal\u00e9 la chose au superviseur chez Manchester Plastics qui s'attendait \u00e0 recevoir une remorque vide. Apr\u00e8s discussion avec Gibson, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle ram\u00e8nerait la remorque chez SPS et qu'un autre chauffeur livrerait une remorque vide \u00e0 Manchester Plastics.\n[66] Mme Laronde a convenu que, compte tenu du message du r\u00e9partiteur, elle aurait d\u00fb v\u00e9rifier le chargement pour voir si la remorque \u00e9tait vide ou renfermait des paniers. Toutefois, elle s'est fi\u00e9e \u00e0 l'information fournie par le superviseur chez SPS, qui lui a dit que la remorque \u00e9tait vide et qu'il n'y avait pas de connaissement. Mme Laronde a admis que si le superviseur lui avait remis un connaissement indiquant que la remorque contenait des paniers vides, elle aurait v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le chargement; compte tenu des mauvaises conditions climatiques et de ses craintes en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, elle aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 quelqu'un d'autre au bureau de SPS de l'aider. Cet incident a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une infraction grave.\nCas comparable\n[67] Le cas comparable cit\u00e9 par la Commission est celui d\u00e9crit par Steve Holt qui, dans son t\u00e9moignage, a dit se rappeler qu'il y avait eu en 1992-1993 un incident mettant en cause Billy Cain, qui n'avait pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 un chargement avant de se rendre \u00e0 Windsor pour le livrer et en ramener un autre. La remorque ne devait contenir que des paniers vides; cependant, lorsque le conducteur qui arrivait des \u00c9tats-Unis a ouvert la remorque pour en v\u00e9rifier le contenu, il a constat\u00e9 que les paniers \u00e9taient remplis de pi\u00e8ces. M. Cain n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pour son trajet et a d\u00fb rembourser le co\u00fbt du carburant. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve document\u00e9 n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit \u00e0 propos de cet incident.\nb) Conclusion au sujet du traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable [68] La Commission et l'intim\u00e9e, Gibson, ont affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agit pas en l'esp\u00e8ce d'un cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9. Il s'agit plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer si Gibson a exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Laronde dans l'application de sa proc\u00e9dure disciplinaire, et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, si la discrimination a influ\u00e9 sur la cessation d'emploi.\n[69] Parmi les dix incidents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la Commission, trois (ceux des 15 ao\u00fbt 1995, 25 juillet 1996 et 18 septembre 1996) n'ont pas men\u00e9s \u00e0 des sanctions disciplinaires. Les raisons pour lesquelles ces incidents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s me paraissent quelque peu myst\u00e9rieuses. Je ne puis que conclure qu'on voulait montrer que Mme Laronde avait d\u00fb se d\u00e9fendre pour \u00e9viter de faire l'objet de mesures disciplinaires. Cependant, aucune preuve similaire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour d\u00e9montrer que les conducteurs de sexe masculin de Gibson n'\u00e9taient pas assujettis au m\u00eame traitement.\n[70] Ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 ray\u00e9, l'incident du 12 juin 1995 au dossier disciplinaire de Mme Laronde n'a pas jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Celui du 2 ao\u00fbt 1996 a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une infraction l\u00e9g\u00e8re et ne semble pas avoir eu d'influence sur la cessation d'emploi.\n[71] En ce qui concerne l'incident culminant du 27 septembre 1996, il ne m'appartient pas de d\u00e9terminer si Gibson \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 prendre des mesures disciplinaires \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Laronde. Il s'agit plut\u00f4t pour moi de d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu discrimination. Le cas analogue est l'incident mettant en cause Billy Cain qui est survenu en 1992-1993. La preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard repose sur un souvenir plut\u00f4t vague de M. Holt et n'est assortie d'aucune documentation \u00e0 l'appui. En outre, il s'agit d'un incident qui remonte bien avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la nouvelle proc\u00e9dure disciplinaire de Gibson. J'attache peu de poids \u00e0 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment.\n[72] Il reste les incidents des 9 mai 1996 (incident Hisan), 6 juin 1996 et 18 juin 1996 (livraisons en retard) ainsi que du 28 juin 1996 (dernier avertissement), pour lesquels il existe des cas comparables.\n[73] En ce qui concerne l'incident Hisan, les cas comparables sont ceux de David Cleary, de HW, de RM et de Scott McWilliams. \u00c0 mon avis, il s'agit de comparaisons valables en ce qui concerne l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 les incidents sont survenus et la nature de ceux-ci. Dans les deux premiers cas (Hisan et Cleary), il s'agissait de plaintes du client. Cleary n'a pas eu de contact physique ni d'engueulade et l'entreprise plaignante n'a pas demand\u00e9 qu'il ne retourne pas \u00e0 son usine. L'entreprise a demand\u00e9 de ne pas sanctionner l'employ\u00e9 fautif, mais plut\u00f4t de lui parler.\n[74] Cleary a re\u00e7u un avertissement verbal. Au bout du compte, le manquement de Mme Laronde a fait l'objet d'une note \u00e0 classer et on a exig\u00e9 qu'elle pr\u00e9sente des excuses. \u00c0 mon avis, l'inconduite de Mme Laronde \u00e9tait beaucoup plus grave que celle de David Cleary. Si les mesures disciplinaires prises \u00e0 son endroit \u00e9taient plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res, conclusion que je ne partage pas n\u00e9cessairement, elles n'en \u00e9taient pas moins justifi\u00e9es.\n[75] Dans les cas de Hisan et de RM, il s'agissait de plaintes du client. En ce qui concerne RM, il n'y a pas eu de contact physique, mais on a craint que le client n'ait plus recours aux services de camionnage de Gibson. RM a cri\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le garde de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du client envers lequel il s'est montr\u00e9 grossier. Il a re\u00e7u un avertissement verbal et a perdu sa prime de rendement exemplaire du fait qu'il s'agissait d'un cas de r\u00e9cidive.\n[76] \u00c0 mon avis, le manquement de Mme Laronde \u00e9tait plus grave que celui commis par RM. Toutefois, la seule mesure disciplinaire dont elle a fait l'objet a \u00e9t\u00e9 une note au dossier. RM, pour sa part, a re\u00e7u un avertissement oral et a subi une perte financi\u00e8re.\n[77] En ce qui concerne HW, il s'agissait d'une plainte du client concernant des remarques inacceptables qu'il avait faites \u00e0 l'endroit d'une de ses employ\u00e9es. Il n'y a pas eu de contact physique et le client n'a pas demand\u00e9 que le conducteur ne revienne plus chez lui. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, HW avait \u00e0 son dossier cinq incidents (aucun d\u00e9tail fourni). Il a re\u00e7u un dernier avertissement et a d\u00fb pr\u00e9senter des excuses par \u00e9crit. Compte tenu de ces faits, Mme Laronde n'a pas selon moi fait l'objet de mesures disciplinaires plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res.\n[78] Le cas de Scott McWilliams est difficile \u00e0 \u00e9valuer du fait que je n'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve au sujet de sa conduite, Je sais seulement qu'il manifestait des probl\u00e8mes de comportement. Il a re\u00e7u un dernier avertissement, a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu sans solde pendant trois semaines et a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de probation de six mois au cours de laquelle on l'a priv\u00e9 de sa prime de rendement exemplaire. Il serait tr\u00e8s difficile de conclure \u00e0 partir de ces faits que Mme Laronde a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e plus s\u00e9v\u00e8rement que Scott McWilliams.\n[79] J'en suis finalement venu \u00e0 la conclusion que l'incident Hisan, comparativement aux cas analogues, ne permet pas de conclure que Mme Laronde ait fait l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable.\n[80] La Commission a fait valoir que Mme Laronde et Steve Semple ont tous deux re\u00e7u un dernier avertissement; cependant, les manquements commis par M. Semple \u00e9taient beaucoup plus flagrants. Il n'y a pas de comparaison possible entre les deux situations de fait. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont amen\u00e9 la compagnie \u00e0 servir un dernier avertissement sont tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rents. Il aurait fallu, pour conclure \u00e0 un traitement plus rigoureux \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Laronde, que celle-ci fasse l'objet de sanctions plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res qu'un dernier avertissement et trois semaines de suspension sans solde.\n[81] Il reste \u00e0 examiner les incidents (livraisons en retard) des 6 juin 1996 et 18 juin 1996. Le cas comparable est celui de Mike Rumble. \u00c0 mon avis, l'affaire Rumble est embarrassante pour Gibson. Les faits entourant les manquements reproch\u00e9s sont tr\u00e8s similaires. Il s'agit dans les deux cas de livraisons en retard; tous les incidents sont survenus en juin 1996. Dans le cas de l'incident du 6 juin 1996, Mme Laronde est arriv\u00e9e en retard pour un \u00e9change de remorques. Le chargement destin\u00e9 \u00e0 Honda n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9 en retard. Son explication para\u00eet raisonnable. Cependant, on lui a imput\u00e9 une faute grave pour le motif qu'un retard est un retard. Le 18 juin 1996, Mme Laronde n'a pas respect\u00e9 sa fen\u00eatre de temps. Elle n'a pas fait appel, estimant qu'un retard est un retard.\n[82] Pour sa part, M. Rumble n'a pas respect\u00e9 sa fen\u00eatre de temps parce qu'il \u00e9tait parti en retard. Aucune explication n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie quant aux raisons de ce retard. Pourtant, l'incident n'a donn\u00e9 lieu qu'au versement d'une note au dossier. Il incombe \u00e0 Gibson de fournir une explication \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La seule explication fournie a \u00e9t\u00e9 celle de Mme Lawrence qui a dit que c'est le r\u00e9partiteur qui a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 l'affaire.\n[83] \u00c0 mon avis, cette explication ne satisfait pas le fardeau de la preuve. Mme Laronde a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e plus s\u00e9v\u00e8rement que M. Rumble dans le cas de ses deux livraisons en retard. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que Gibson a exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, contrevenant ainsi au paragraphe 7b) de la Loi.\n[84] Le fait que ces deux manquements \u00e0 la discipline ait beaucoup jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi est tout aussi important. Si Mme Laronde avait fait l'objet de mesures disciplinaires \u00e9quivalentes \u00e0 celles auxquelles M. Rumble a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis, son dossier au 28 juin 1996 aurait fait \u00e9tat d'un seul manquement grave, soit l'infraction relative aux heures de service, laquelle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise aux oubliettes le 30 juin 1996, avec le r\u00e9sultat qu'elle n'aurait plus eu d'infractions graves \u00e0 son dossier et que Gibson n'aurait pas eu \u00e0 donner un dernier avertissement. Le manquement grave du 27 septembre 1996 n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un incident culminant et n'aurait pas, par cons\u00e9quent, men\u00e9 \u00e0 la cessation de son emploi.\n(ii) Harc\u00e8lement sexuel - art. 14 de la Loi [85] Lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u son dernier avertissement le 3 juillet 1996, Mme Laronde a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Gibson le jour m\u00eame pour dire qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le fait qu'elle avait trois infractions \u00e0 son dossier et qu'elle risquait d'\u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e. Elle a demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre mut\u00e9e de la section \u00c9tats-Unis \u00e0 l'une des trois autres. Gibson a acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa demande et l'a affect\u00e9e \u00e0 la section des suppl\u00e9ants.\n[86] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Laronde a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle ne voulait plus faire partie de la section \u00c9tats-Unis parce qu'elle croyait \u00eatre constamment surveill\u00e9e au moyen du syst\u00e8me satellite et que c'est \u00e0 cause de cette situation qu'elle avait r\u00e9cemment accumul\u00e9 un certain nombre de manquements \u00e0 la discipline qui compromettaient son maintien en poste. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les camions affect\u00e9s aux itin\u00e9raires am\u00e9ricains \u00e9taient les seuls dot\u00e9s d'un syst\u00e8me satellite, elle pensait qu'elle n'aurait plus de probl\u00e8me une fois qu'elle ne ferait plus partie de la section \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[87] Le service de r\u00e9partition de la section \u00c9tats-Unis et les conducteurs peuvent communiquer entre eux gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la radiomessagerie par satellite. Les messages transmis par le r\u00e9partiteur apparaissent sur l'\u00e9cran LDS install\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du camion et peuvent \u00eatre lus uniquement sur cet \u00e9cran. Le conducteur peut r\u00e9pondre aux messages au moyen du clavier dont il dispose. L'appareil de radiomessagerie par satellite qu'utilise le r\u00e9partiteur de la section \u00c9tats-Unis se trouve dans une salle r\u00e9serv\u00e9e au r\u00e9partiteur dans les bureaux de Gibson.\n[88] La radiomessagerie par satellite peut servir \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer o\u00f9 se trouve chaque camion de Gibson qui circule aux \u00c9tats-Unis, la distance qu'il a parcourue, le temps qu'il a mis \u00e0 franchir cette distance, si le camion est gar\u00e9, si le moteur est en marche, etc. Il est possible d'imprimer tous les messages transmis et re\u00e7us par radiomessagerie. Cependant, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on ne le fait que si cela est justifi\u00e9.\n[89] Mme Laronde et la Commission ont toutes deux reconnu que les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement sexuel ne visent que Steve Holt et personne d'autre chez Gibson. Lorsque Mme Laronde est entr\u00e9e au service de Gibson, M. Holt \u00e9tait l'un des conducteurs de la section \u00c9tats-Unis. En septembre 1994, M. Holt est devenu surveillant de nuit. \u00c0 ce titre, M. Holt n'agissait pas comme r\u00e9partiteur et n'exer\u00e7ait sur les conducteurs aucune surveillance ni aucun contr\u00f4le du point de vue disciplinaire. Sa principale t\u00e2che consistait \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer les factures et \u00e0 tenir la feuille de paye dont l'\u00e9quipe de la comptabilit\u00e9 allait avoir besoin le lendemain matin. Ses autres fonctions consistaient \u00e0 r\u00e9gler des probl\u00e8mes auxquels les conducteurs \u00e9taient confront\u00e9s durant le poste de nuit et \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux demandes de renseignements des clients. Il arrivait que M. Holt donne des instructions \u00e0 un conducteur en cas de r\u00e9elle n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, mais ses pouvoirs s'arr\u00eataient l\u00e0.\n[90] Le fait que M. Holt ait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste de surveillant de nuit vers la fin de septembre 1995 et soit redevenu conducteur \u00e0 temps plein au sein de la section \u00c9tats-Unis n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9. Il a quitt\u00e9 Gibson le 19 avril 1996 pour devenir conducteur d'autocar. Il n'y a pas eu de contacts entre Mme Laronde et M. Holt apr\u00e8s cette date.\na) Pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de harc\u00e8lement sexuel 1. L'enveloppe des voyages - As-tu fait du caf\u00e9 pour Steve? [91] \u00c0 l'int\u00e9rieur des bureaux de Gibson, il y a une salle r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux conducteurs o\u00f9 l'on trouve une grande table et des chaises. Les conducteurs vont \u00e0 cet endroit pour boire du caf\u00e9, raconter des histoires et bavarder entre coll\u00e8gues. Il y a \u00e9galement dans cette salle un pigeonnier dans lequel on met le courrier des conducteurs.\n[92] Dans la case du pigeonnier r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque conducteur se trouve une grande enveloppe en papier manille, l'enveloppe des voyages, sur laquelle figurent son nom et son num\u00e9ro d'employ\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s chaque trajet effectu\u00e9, le conducteur met la documentation y aff\u00e9rente dans l'enveloppe des voyages, puis d\u00e9pose celle-ci dans un grand bac \u00e0 l'usage de tous les conducteurs qui se trouve dans la pi\u00e8ce. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u, pour traitement, la documentation qui lui est destin\u00e9e, le service de la comptabilit\u00e9 remet les enveloppes des conducteurs dans le pigeonnier.\n[93] Steve Holt avait inscrit sur l'enveloppe de Mme Laronde deux questions : [TRADUCTION] As-tu sign\u00e9 tes connaissements?, Ai-je fait du caf\u00e9 pour Steve?. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Laronde a indiqu\u00e9 que M. Holt se targuait d'\u00eatre un homme au vrai sens du terme et soutenait que la femme \u00e9tait \u00e0 son service. Chaque fois qu'elle lui remettait une documentation, M. Holt lui rappelait son \u00e9tat de servilit\u00e9. Mme Laronde n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 quand ces faits se sont produits.\n[94] M. Holt a admis avoir inscrit ces choses-l\u00e0. Il a toutefois expliqu\u00e9 que les conducteurs venaient dans la salle qui leur \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9e pour remplir leur thermos de caf\u00e9. S'il n'y avait pas de caf\u00e9, ils se plaignaient \u00e0 lui. Il a dit qu'il pr\u00e9parait probablement entre 50 et 60 cafeti\u00e8res par semaine. D'apr\u00e8s ce dont il se souvenait, Mme Laronde s'\u00e9tait probablement plainte qu'il n'y avait pas de caf\u00e9 dans la salle. Il lui aurait alors servi la r\u00e9ponse en question.\n[95] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Holt a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que tout le monde avait acc\u00e8s aux enveloppes des voyages et que les conducteurs inscrivaient souvent des commentaires sur les enveloppes de leurs coll\u00e8gues. Certains commentaires \u00e9taient grossiers ou vulgaires. D'autres commentaires avaient trait au fait que l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 avait omis de faire le plein ou de laver son camion. Souvent, ils inscrivaient le surnom du conducteur -Eddy le tripode humain, Billy long dong, le Vieux raseur, Newfie, etc. Tout le monde avait acc\u00e8s au pigeonnier des conducteurs. Il n'\u00e9tait pas rare de trouver l\u00e0 des dessous f\u00e9minins, des supports athl\u00e9tiques, du fromage ou des outils. Il a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 qu'il arrivait qu'un conducteur use une enveloppe par semaine, tout d\u00e9pendant de la quantit\u00e9 de documentation qu'il y mettait. Les conducteurs dont l'enveloppe \u00e9tait d\u00e9chir\u00e9e pouvaient en obtenir une autre en s'adressant \u00e0 n'importe lequel des employ\u00e9s travaillant dans le bureau.\n[96] M. Holt a expliqu\u00e9 que Mme Laronde ne s'\u00e9tait jamais plainte \u00e0 lui des choses qu'il avait inscrites sur son enveloppe et qu'elle aurait pu facilement remplacer celle-ci par une nouvelle enveloppe. Mme Lawrence a elle aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que Mme Laronde aurait pu demander une nouvelle enveloppe n'importe quand. Mme Laronde a reconnu qu'elle aurait pu le faire, mais qu'elle ne l'avait pas fait, et ce, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que M. Holt eut quitt\u00e9 Gibson.\n2. Les \u00e9bats sexuels sur le r\u00e9servoir de carburant [97] Mme Laronde a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Holt se vantait souvent dans la salle des conducteurs de ses exploits sur la route. Il aimait raconter des histoires. Mme Laronde a dit que, peu apr\u00e8s son entr\u00e9e en fonctions chez Gibson, elle s'\u00e9tait rendue dans la salle des conducteurs au moment o\u00f9 M. Holt racontait un de ses exploits \u00e0 des coll\u00e8gues. Il \u00e9tait camionneur chez Zavitz Transport. Il s'est arr\u00eat\u00e9 dans un bar o\u00f9 il a rencontr\u00e9 une femme. Ils sont ensuite sortis tous les deux dehors et ont fait l'amour sur le r\u00e9servoir de carburant de son camion. Il a racont\u00e9 que le mari de la femme en question \u00e9tait sorti du bar et qu'il s'\u00e9tait battu avec lui dans le parc de stationnement.\n[98] M. Holt a donn\u00e9 sa version. \u00c0 sa sortie d'un bar, il a fait une rencontre pour le moins inusit\u00e9e, expliquant qu'une femme se trouvait l\u00e0. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que celle-ci se trouvait sur le r\u00e9servoir de carburant de son camion et qu'elle et lui \u00e9taient en train de fol\u00e2trer lorsque, soudainement, une voiture est arriv\u00e9e et que la porti\u00e8re du passager s'est ouverte brusquement. Le petit vieillard qui se trouvait \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur a dit \u00e0 la dame d'entrer dans la voiture et ils ont d\u00e9guerpi.\n[99] M. Holt a dit ne pas se rappeler s'il avait racont\u00e9 cette histoire dans la salle des conducteurs ou sur la radio BP. Il n'a pu non plus se rappeler s'il l'avait racont\u00e9e en pr\u00e9sence de Mme Laronde. Elle ne s'est jamais plainte \u00e0 lui que l'histoire \u00e9tait d\u00e9plac\u00e9e ou inopportune.\n[100] M. Holt a compar\u00e9 la salle des conducteurs \u00e0 un vestiaire pour hommes. Il s'y racontait beaucoup de plaisanteries. On se bidonnait, on hurlait, on disait des obsc\u00e9nit\u00e9s, etc. Les conducteurs racontaient des choses qu'ils avaient vues sur la route. Selon M. Holt, les sc\u00e8nes qu'un conducteur peut voir du haut de son perchoir \u00e0 dix pieds du sol sont parfois comiques, parfois loufoques. Il leur arrive m\u00eame de voir des couples en train de forniquer sur la banquette avant de leur voiture. Souvent, les conducteurs ne se lassent pas de raconter ces choses-l\u00e0. \u00c0 son avis, son histoire ressemblait \u00e0 beaucoup d'histoires qui se racontent dans la salle des conducteurs.\n[101] M. Holt a dit que les conducteurs de camions sont des conteurs d'histoires. [TRADUCTION] Quatre-vingt-dix pour cent des histoires qu'ils racontent sont de la foutaise et l'autre dix pour cent, des choses \u00e0 prendre avec un grain de sel. Il n'y a pas moyen de distinguer ce qui est vrai de ce qui ne l'est pas. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne faut jamais prendre quelque chose au pied de la lettre.\n3. Le racolage dans le parc de stationnement - message transmis par radiomessagerie satellite [102] Mme Laronde a racont\u00e9 que, lors d'un trajet aux \u00c9tats-Unis, elle s'\u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9e \u00e0 l'endroit habituel pour dormir et avait re\u00e7u un message par radiomessagerie satellite de la part de M. Holt qui lui demandait : Que fais-tu? Tu racoles dans le parc de stationnement?. \u00c0 son avis, M. Holt voulait insinuer qu'elle tentait d'arrondir ses fins de mois en travaillant comme prostitu\u00e9e dans le parc de stationnement. D'apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, ce fait remontait \u00e0 novembre ou d\u00e9cembre 1995. Mme Laronde a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces allusions l'avaient vraiment boulevers\u00e9e. Elle n'a pas r\u00e9pondu au message et n'en n'a pas parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Holt. Pour sa part, M. Holt a dit ne pas se souvenir d'avoir envoy\u00e9 le message.\n4. Le message de Chris Reid [103] Chris Reid \u00e9tait l'un des propri\u00e9taires-exploitants de Gibson et un ami de Mme Laronde. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Laronde a indiqu\u00e9 que M. Reid avait communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Holt alors qu'il revenait des \u00c9tats-Unis pour s'enqu\u00e9rir de la pr\u00e9sence de coll\u00e8gues dans la r\u00e9gion o\u00f9 il se trouvait. Les conducteurs aiment voyager ensemble. Ils ont l'impression que le temps passe plus vite ainsi et que cela les aide \u00e0 demeurer vigilants. M. Holt a transmis \u00e0 Mme Laronde le message suivant : [TRADUCTION] Chris Reid t'attend \u00e0 Tilbury. D\u00e9p\u00eache-toi, il t'attend pour te faire la passe.. Lorsqu'elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Tilbury, M. Reid \u00e9tait dans son camion. Elle a frapp\u00e9 sur la porti\u00e8re, lui disant qu'elle avait re\u00e7u un message lui demandant de venir le retrouver l\u00e0. Elle est all\u00e9e chez Tim acheter deux caf\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s quoi ils sont rentr\u00e9s \u00e0 Alliston dans leur camion.\n[104] Sur le chemin du retour, M. Reid a dit \u00e0 Mme Laronde sur la radio BP qu'il avait v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le message dans son camion pendant qu'elle achetait les caf\u00e9s. Il lui a dit avoir fait cela parce qu'au moment o\u00f9 il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Holt s'il y avait des coll\u00e8gues dans les parages, celui-ci avait insinu\u00e9 qu'il voulait que Mme Laronde vienne le retrouver pour faire l'amour avec lui. M. Reid lui a dit avoir ni\u00e9 la chose avec v\u00e9h\u00e9mence aupr\u00e8s de M. Holt. Il a voulu v\u00e9rifier le message envoy\u00e9 par M. Holt par radiomessagerie satellite pour d\u00e9terminer exactement ce qui y \u00e9tait dit. Selon Mme Laronde, cet incident se serait produit en septembre 1995.\n[105] M. Holt a dit se souvenir d'avoir transmis ce message, mais a donn\u00e9 une version quelque peu diff\u00e9rente des faits. Selon lui, M. Reid, qui \u00e9tait dans la salle du r\u00e9partiteur de la section \u00c9tats-Unis, lui a dit qu'ils tractaient des remorques \u00e0 \u00e9changer. Il a demand\u00e9 o\u00f9 se trouvait Mme Laronde et a pri\u00e9 M. Holt de lui dire qu'il la rencontrerait l\u00e0-bas pour lui faire la passe.\n[106] Selon la version de M. Holt, Mme Laronde et M. Reid \u00e9taient de bons amis et ce commentaire se voulait une plaisanterie. M. Reid d\u00e9sirait simplement qu'ils se rencontrent afin de pouvoir faire route ensemble.\n5. Bob Watt - partage de sa couchette avec Chris Reid [107] Bob Watt a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Laronde s'\u00e9tait plainte \u00e0 lui qu'elle avait re\u00e7u de la part de M. Holt une nuit des messages par radiomessagerie satellite qu'elle jugeait grossiers. M. Watt s'est rendu au bureau du r\u00e9partiteur de la section \u00c9tats-Unis o\u00f9 il a lu l'imprim\u00e9 des messages. Le message qui a retenu son attention parlait de Mme Laronde partageant une couchette avec Chris Reid. Selon M. Watt, le message avait forc\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis par Steve Holt puisque c'\u00e9tait lui qui agissait comme surveillant de nuit. M. Watt a dit ne pas se souvenir si le nom du destinataire \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans le message; toutefois, il a dit qu'il savait \u00e0 qui le message \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 puisque le num\u00e9ro du camion \u00e9tait inscrit.\n[108] M. Watt a dit se souvenir qu'il avait vu ce message en janvier, f\u00e9vrier ou mars 1995. En contre-interrogatoire, M. Watt a affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait se souvenir de la date exacte, mais que ce devait \u00eatre au milieu des ann\u00e9es 90. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, c'\u00e9tait dans l'ann\u00e9e ayant pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 celle o\u00f9 Gibson a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi. En fait, son emploi a pris fin le 22 mai 1996. Il a convenu que ces messages auraient pu \u00eatre envoy\u00e9s entre mai 1995 et mai 1996.\n6. John Hepburn - rester chez elle couch\u00e9e sur le dos avec les jambes ouvertes [109] John Hepburn \u00e9tait un ami de Mme Laronde chez Gibson, o\u00f9 il a travaill\u00e9 comme conducteur entre 1993 et 1999. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, il a indiqu\u00e9 que Mme Laronde lui avait dit \u00eatre parfois choqu\u00e9e par les messages que M. Holt lui transmettait par radiomessagerie, ainsi que par les remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes qu'il lui faisait. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que M. Holt lui disait toujours que Mme Laronde [TRADUCTION] devrait demeurer chez elle couch\u00e9e sur le dos avec les jambes ouvertes plut\u00f4t que de conduire sur les routes et qu'elle avait un [TRADUCTION] beau cul. Lorsque M. Holt lui a dit ces choses, il y avait d'autres personnes dans la salle des conducteurs. M. Hepburn n'a pu se rappeler si Mme Laronde \u00e9tait l\u00e0 au moment o\u00f9 M. Holt a soi-disant formul\u00e9 ces commentaires. Il n'a pas dit non plus s'il avait fait part de ces commentaires \u00e0 Mme Laronde. Mme Laronde n'a fourni aucune pr\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 savoir si elle avait elle-m\u00eame entendu ces paroles ou si celles-ci lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9es. M. Hepburn n'a pas dit \u00e0 quelle \u00e9poque les remarques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es. Il n'a vu aucun des messages transmis par radiomessagerie satellite.\n[110] M. Holt a ni\u00e9 avoir fait les remarques en question. Il a affirm\u00e9 que c'est le genre de remarques que M. Hepburn aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus susceptible que lui de faire et auxquelles il aurait peut-\u00eatre souscrit. Il ne s'agissait pas de choses que lui aurait pu dire.\n7. Gary Kitchener - renvoyez cette chienne [111] Gary Kitchener \u00e9tait lui aussi un ami de Mme Laronde chez Gibson, o\u00f9 il a travaill\u00e9 comme conducteur de 1994 \u00e0 novembre 1995, date o\u00f9 l'entreprise a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, M. Kitchener a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Laronde lui avait dit, \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1995, que Steve Holt lui avait transmis par radiomessagerie satellite des messages de harc\u00e8lement et \u00e0 connotation sexuelle. Il s'est \u00e9galement souvenu qu'il \u00e9tait dans la salle de conducteurs \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 avec des coll\u00e8gues lorsque M. Holt y est entr\u00e9 en vocif\u00e9rant contre Mme Laronde. Il aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Je vais faire cong\u00e9dier cette chienne. Je ne peux plus l'endurer. Mme Laronde n'\u00e9tait pas dans la salle des conducteurs \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[112] De l'avis de M. Kitchener, M. Holt n'aurait pas d\u00fb affirmer cela, d'autant plus qu'il se trouvait en pr\u00e9sence d'autres conducteurs. Il a not\u00e9 la date et l'heure. Lorsqu'il a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Laronde environ un mois plus tard, il lui a racont\u00e9 ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. S'il l'a fait, c'est parce qu'il craignait pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de Mme Laronde et son emploi. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Kitchener a dit qu'il ne se rappelait pas de la date exacte, mais que cela devait \u00eatre en juillet ou ao\u00fbt 1995.\n[113] M. Holt a ni\u00e9 avoir fait cette remarque. \u00c0 titre de surveillant de nuit, il n'avait aucunement le pouvoir d'imposer des mesures disciplinaires \u00e0 un conducteur et n'\u00e9tait certes pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 cong\u00e9dier des employ\u00e9s de Gibson.\n8. Surveillance par satellite [114] Mme Laronde a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait l'impression que M. Holt passait beaucoup de temps \u00e0 la surveiller chaque nuit au moyen du satellite. Elle a donn\u00e9 trois exemples \u00e0 l'appui de cette assertion. La premi\u00e8re situation remontait au d\u00e9but de 1996, alors qu'elle revenait des \u00c9tats-Unis dans une grosse temp\u00eate. Elle a re\u00e7u \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 un message par radiomessagerie satellite de la part de M. Holt : [TRADUCTION] Sais-tu qu'il t'a fallu neuf heures pour parcourir 235 milles? Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Laronde a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cela l'avait profond\u00e9ment boulevers\u00e9e, car elle faisait des pieds et des mains pour arriver \u00e0 bon port en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. M. Holt avait \u00e0 son avis mis en doute son professionnalisme en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 elle se trouvait et en signalant le fait qu'elle \u00e9tait encore sur la route, en d\u00e9pit des conditions extr\u00eamement mauvaises et glac\u00e9es. Interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet, M. Holt a dit qu'il \u00e9tait probable qu'il ait transmis ce message, mais ce non pas en 1996 mais plut\u00f4t un an auparavant.\n[115] Mme Laronde a \u00e9galement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux imprim\u00e9s des messages transmis par radiomessagerie satellite d\u00e9montrant que M. Holt l'avait surveill\u00e9e le 15 juin 1995, la nuit o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait revenue chez elle dans son camion, incident qui lui avait fait perdre la moiti\u00e9 de sa prime de rendement exemplaire.\n[116] \u00c0 une autre occasion, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait engag\u00e9e dans la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape d'un trajet en sol am\u00e9ricain amorc\u00e9 depuis Vincennes, Mme Laronde a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s'arr\u00eater pour dormir durant quatre heures \u00e0 Orangeville. Elle a alors re\u00e7u par radiomessagerie satellite un message de la part de M. Holt lui demandant de ramener le camion dans la cour \u00e0 Alliston o\u00f9 elle devait, selon son horaire, arriver beaucoup plus tard, soit entre 18 h 30 et 19 h; malgr\u00e9 son intention de dormir quatre heures, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de retour bien \u00e0 temps. Elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 le nombre d'heures selon son carnet de route; cependant, M. Holt lui a envoy\u00e9 un autre message indiquant que le camion devait \u00eatre ramen\u00e9 sans tarder. Mme Laronde a gar\u00e9 son camion \u00e0 Orangeville entre deux autres poids lourds et a dormi durant quatre heures.\n[117] M. Holt se souvenait bien de cet incident. Gibson avait besoin du camion de Mme Laronde et il lui avait donn\u00e9 plusieurs options. En fin de compte, il a pris des dispositions pour qu'un conducteur de rel\u00e8ve aille chercher le camion de Mme Laronde afin de permettre \u00e0 celle-ci de dormir et de ne pas d\u00e9passer le maximum d'heures admissibles. Il a \u00e9galement fait le n\u00e9cessaire pour qu'elle puisse revenir jusque dans la cour chez Gibson en matin\u00e9e dans un camion-tracteur \u00e0 cabine courte et pour que quelqu'un d'autre passe prendre ses effets qui n'avaient pu \u00eatre mis dans le v\u00e9hicule, faute de place.\n[118] Pour ce qui est des all\u00e9gations de Mme Laronde, M. Holt a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il ne surveillait les conducteurs par satellite qu'en cas de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Il surveillait les camions, et non les conducteurs, durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 il a agi comme surveillant de nuit, et il n'a pas suivi Mme Laronde au moyen du syst\u00e8me satellite plus que n'importe quel autre conducteur circulant aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Il a affirm\u00e9 que tout conducteur qui conduit un camion muni d'un syst\u00e8me de radiomessagerie satellite a l'impression d'\u00eatre surveill\u00e9.\n[119] Mme Laronde a affirm\u00e9 que M. Holt l'intimidait et qu'elle faisait tout pour l'\u00e9viter. Lorsqu'elle revenait au bureau la nuit, elle n'allait pas dans la salle des conducteurs pour y remplir sa documentation. Elle la remplissait dans le camion et n'allait dans la salle que pour remettre la cl\u00e9 du camion et la documentation. Elle quittait ensuite les lieux le plus rapidement possible.\n[120] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Laronde a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle s'\u00e9tait plainte \u00e0 un certain nombre de personnes chez Gibson de ce qu'elle consid\u00e9rait \u00eatre du harc\u00e8lement de la part de M. Holt. En plus de parler \u00e0 ses amis chez Gibson (Gary Kitchener, John Hepburn, Chris Reid, etc.), elle s'est plainte aux personnes qui, pensait-elle, exer\u00e7aient des fonctions de surveillance et pouvaient faire cesser le comportement de M. Holt. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, la compagnie n'avait pas de politique ni de proc\u00e9dures qu'elle aurait pu \u00e0 sa connaissance invoquer.\n[121] La premi\u00e8re personne qu'elle est all\u00e9e trouver - vers janvier 1996 - \u00e9tait Mike Morton, le surveillant de M. Holt. M. Morton lui a dit qu'il n'y avait pas \u00e0 son avis grand-chose \u00e0 faire, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les rapports \u00e9troits qu'entretenaient M. Holt et les Gibson.\n[122] Mme Laronde a ensuite parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Willie Teigesser, son r\u00e9partiteur. Elle lui a demand\u00e9 s'il avait vu les messages qu'elle avait re\u00e7us par radiomessagerie satellite. Il a r\u00e9pondu par l'affirmative. Aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e quant aux messages pr\u00e9cis qu'il avait vus. Cette conversation a eu lieu environ une semaine apr\u00e8s celle avec Mike Morton. Mme Laronde a demand\u00e9 qu'on dise \u00e0 M. Holt de cesser de lui transmettre par radiomessagerie satellite des messages qui n'avaient pas trait au travail. La r\u00e9ponse de M. Teigesser a \u00e9t\u00e9 la m\u00eame que celle fournie par M. Morton.\n[123] Mme Laronde est ensuite all\u00e9e trouver Bob Watt, le directeur de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 chez Gibson, au d\u00e9but de 1996. Elle lui a dit qu'elle recevait de la part de M. Holt par radiomessagerie satellite des messages inopportuns qui l'effrayaient. Elle ne savait que faire et \u00e9tait en qu\u00eate de conseils. M. Watt a dit qu'il ne pouvait rien faire parce qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas le surveillant de M. Holt. Il lui a dit que Stacey Beckstead, qui travaillait dans le bureau, avait eu elle aussi des difficult\u00e9s avec M. Holt et il lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de lui parler. Mme Laronde a abord\u00e9 la question avec Stacey Beckstead, qui s'est montr\u00e9e plut\u00f4t discr\u00e8te, mais qui lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de parler de la chose \u00e0 son p\u00e8re, Rick Beckstead, le vice-pr\u00e9sident (exploitation) chez Gibson.\n[124] Mme Laronde a dit qu'elle avait rencontr\u00e9 M. Beckstead dans son bureau en mars 1996. Elle lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait l'impression que M. Holt la harcelait au moyen de la radiomessagerie satellite et lui a donn\u00e9 comme exemple le message concernant les 235 milles parcourus en neuf heures. Elle a dit \u00e0 M. Beckstead qu'elle voulait s'acquitter au mieux de ses t\u00e2ches, mais que les agissements de M. Holt commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 lui peser. M. Beckstead n'a rien dit ni laiss\u00e9 para\u00eetre quoi que ce soit lors de cette rencontre. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Laronde, le comportement de M. Holt a chang\u00e9 par la suite. Il ne s'adressait plus \u00e0 elle directement et il y avait beaucoup d'animosit\u00e9.\n[125] Mme Laronde a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 de M. Holt \u00e0 Mme Lawrence apr\u00e8s l'arriv\u00e9e de celle-ci chez Gibson. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, la conversation a eu lieu en avril ou mai 1996. Mme Lawrence a confirm\u00e9 que Mme Laronde l'avait saisie de la question, non pas en 1996 mais plut\u00f4t en ao\u00fbt 1995, peu apr\u00e8s sa nomination au poste de gestionnaire, Ressources humaines. Mme Laronde lui a racont\u00e9 que M. Holt lui envoyait des messages inopportuns par radiomessagerie satellite et formulait des remarques vulgaires \u00e0 son sujet dans la salle des conducteurs. Mme Lawrence a dit qu'elle parlerait \u00e0 M. Holt, ce qu'elle a fait. Elle a fait part \u00e0 M. Holt des pr\u00e9occupations de Mme Laronde. Il a ni\u00e9 que des choses comme cela se soient produites. Ils ont discut\u00e9 de la question du harc\u00e8lement et du fait que le harc\u00e8lement n'\u00e9tait pas tol\u00e9r\u00e9 par la compagnie. S'il y avait des actes de harc\u00e8lement, ceux-ci devaient cesser. Mme Lawrence a \u00e9galement dit \u00e0 M. Holt que si un incident du genre survenait, il devait la saisir, elle, de la chose plut\u00f4t que de traiter directement avec Mme Laronde.\n[126] Mme Lawrence a fait part \u00e0 Mme Laronde peu de temps apr\u00e8s des r\u00e9sultats de sa conversation avec M. Holt, pr\u00e9cisant que celui-ci avait ni\u00e9 les choses qu'elle lui reprochait et qu'il avait accept\u00e9 de communiquer avec elle uniquement si les n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s du service l'exigeaient. Selon Mme Lawrence, Mme Laronde a sembl\u00e9 accepter cela et l'affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 close. Elle n'a jamais par la suite entendu Mme Lawrence ou M. Holt parler de harc\u00e8lement. \u00c0 sa connaissance, il n'y a pas eu d'autres contacts entre Mme Laronde et M. Holt.\nb) Le droit - Harc\u00e8lement sexuel [127] Aux termes de l'article 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, le fait de harceler un individu constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. En vertu du paragraphe 14(2) de la Loi, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. La Loi ne d\u00e9finit pas ce qu'est le harc\u00e8lement sexuel, mais les cours ont rendu un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 ce sujet. L'arr\u00eat cl\u00e9 est celui rendu par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252. Dans cette affaire, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9fini le harc\u00e8lement sexuel comme une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d'emploi pour les victimes de harc\u00e8lement (p. 1284). La Cour a \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit le harc\u00e8lement sexuel comme une pratique d\u00e9gradante, qui inflige un grave affront \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s forc\u00e9s de le subir (p. 1284).\n[128] Des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires ult\u00e9rieures ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les genres de comportement qui peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans l'arr\u00eat Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes et Kimberley Franke, [1999] 3 C.F. 653 (C.F., 1re inst.), fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au livre du professeur Aggarwal intitul\u00e9 Sexual Harassment in the Workplace, 2e \u00e9d. (1992), dans lequel l'auteur indique qu'il y a trois genres de harc\u00e8lement sexuel (verbal, physique et psychologique). Sur le plan verbal, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel peut comprendre les remarques importunes, les plaisanteries qui causent un malaise ou de l'embarras, les insultes d'ordre sexuel, les conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques ou autres types de conversation ou de message ayant un ton d'ordre sexuel. Sur le plan physique, l'employ\u00e9e en cause peut \u00eatre victime des actes suivants : \u00e9treintes, agressions, tapes, effleurements, etc. Le harc\u00e8lement psychologique peut comporter les actes suivants : incessante sollicitation d'intimit\u00e9 physique, sollicitations, propositions de faveurs sexuelles.\n[129] Dans l'arr\u00eat Franke, la Cour fait aussi mention d'autres facteurs \u00e0 prendre en compte. Une fois qu'on a constat\u00e9 que la conduite est de nature sexuelle et non sollicit\u00e9e, il doit y avoir un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, sauf s'il s'agit d'un incident unique grave, pour qu'elle soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Plus la conduite est grave et ses cons\u00e9quences manifestes, moins la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition sera importante; \u00e0 l'inverse, moins la conduite est grave et ses cons\u00e9quences manifestes, plus la persistance doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e.\nc) Analyse et conclusion [130] C'est dans ce cadre juridique que je dois maintenant examiner les incidents qui, selon les all\u00e9gations de la Commission et de la plaignante, constituent du harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\n[131] Des questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 se posent tant en ce qui concerne certains des incidents de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harc\u00e8lement qu'\u00e0 propos des dates des d\u00e9marches faites par Mme Laronde pour que la direction s'occupe de ses plaintes au sujet de M. Holt.\n[132] Penchons-nous d'abord sur les incidents. Il y en a trois. Le premier a trait au message transmis par radiomessagerie satellite concernant le racolage dans le parc de stationnement que M. Holt, selon les all\u00e9gations de Mme Laronde, aurait transmis en novembre ou d\u00e9cembre 1995. M. Holt n'agissait pas comme surveillant de nuit durant cette p\u00e9riode. Lorsque ce fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 la connaissance de Mme Laronde, elle a \u00e9mis l'hypoth\u00e8se que M. Holt, qui \u00e9tait conducteur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, aurait pu se rendre une nuit au bureau du r\u00e9partiteur de la section \u00c9tats-Unis durant ses temps libres pour lui envoyer ce message. Mme Laronde n'a pas voulu r\u00e9viser son estimation quant \u00e0 la date de la r\u00e9ception du message (contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'elle a fait pour d'autres incidents pour lesquels elle avait initialement fourni de mauvaises dates).\n[133] Au regard de ces faits, il y a trois conclusions possibles : Mme Laronde n'a pas re\u00e7u le message; elle l'a re\u00e7u, mais il ne provenait pas de M. Holt; elle l'a re\u00e7u, mais s'est tromp\u00e9e de date et n'a pas voulu l'admettre. \u00c0 mon avis, son hypoth\u00e8se quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont M. Holt lui aurait transmis le message par radiomessagerie satellite n'est tout simplement pas cr\u00e9dible. Il incombe \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 la plaignante de d\u00e9montrer que ce message a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par M. Holt. \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas la chose et je ne puis tenir compte de cet incident pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\n[134] Quant \u00e0 l'affirmation de John Hepburn selon laquelle M. Holt aurait dit que Mme Laronde devrait [TRADUCTION] rester chez elle sur le dos avec ses jambes ouvertes, les preuves sont contradictoires. M. Holt a ni\u00e9 avoir fait cette remarque. M. Hepburn n'a donn\u00e9 aucune indication quant \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e remarque aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e. Il ne se souvient pas si la remarque a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en pr\u00e9sence de Mme Laronde. Il ne se souvient pas non plus s'il a fait part de cette remarque \u00e0 Mme Laronde alors qu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de Gibson. C'\u00e9tait un ami de Mme Laronde chez Gibson. Il a donc int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 appuyer ses pr\u00e9tentions.\n[135] D'autre part, M. Holt, dans son t\u00e9moignage, a admis avoir transmis par radiomessagerie satellite certains messages \u00e0 Mme Laronde. Il a aussi reconnu avoir racont\u00e9 l'histoire de la dame sur le r\u00e9servoir de carburant. Il a \u00e9galement convenu qu'il avait envoy\u00e9 par radiomessagerie satellite le message concernant les 235 milles parcourus en neuf heures et a m\u00eame fourni une date qui rend la chose plausible, contrairement \u00e0 celle fournie par Mme Laronde. \u00c0 propos de la question de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage de M. Holt \u00e0 celui de M. Hepburn.\n[136] Enfin, il y a l'affirmation de M. Watt voulant qu'il ait lu l'imprim\u00e9 d'un message que M. Holt aurait envoy\u00e9 par radiomessagerie satellite \u00e0 Mme Laronde et selon lequel elle partageait la couchette avec Chris Reid. M. Watt a d'abord dit avoir vu ce message entre janvier et mars 1995. En contre-interrogatoire, il s'est ravis\u00e9, affirmant qu'il l'avait vu \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au milieu des ann\u00e9es 90, peut-\u00eatre entre mai 1995 et mai 1996. De toute \u00e9vidence, l'intervalle de temps indiqu\u00e9 pose probl\u00e8me puisque M. Holt n'occupait plus le poste de surveillant de nuit apr\u00e8s septembre 1995. De plus, Mme Laronde, celle qui aurait re\u00e7u ledit message et qui se souvenait tr\u00e8s bien des messages transmis par M. Holt par radiomessagerie satellite, n'en a pas fait mention dans son t\u00e9moignage. Enfin, ce message ne s'inscrit dans aucun contexte et on ne sait pas quelles circonstances auraient pu amener M. Holt \u00e0 l'envoyer entre janvier et mars 1995 ou entre mai 1995 et mai 1996.\n[137] \u00c0 mon avis, la conclusion qui s'impose est qu'il n'y a pas eu deux messages concernant Chris Reid. M. Watt, dans ses souvenirs, a confondu ce message avec celui concernant Chris Reid auquel Mme Laronde a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans son t\u00e9moignage. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'est pas cr\u00e9dible et ne doit pas \u00eatre pris en compte pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\n[138] En ce qui concerne le message concernant le trajet depuis Vincennes, Mme Laronde a dit l'avoir re\u00e7u en f\u00e9vrier 1996. Elle s'est par la suite ravis\u00e9e, affirmant l'avoir re\u00e7u en f\u00e9vrier 1995. Toutefois, elle a maintenu avoir re\u00e7u au d\u00e9but de 1996 le message concernant les 235 milles parcourus en neuf heures.\n[139] Les souvenirs de Mme Laronde \u00e9taient \u00e9galement confus quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la direction. Au d\u00e9but, elle a pr\u00e9tendu avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les personnes mentionn\u00e9es entre le d\u00e9but de janvier 1996 (Mike Morton) et avril ou mai 1996 (Mme Lawrence). Toutefois, en contre-interrogatoire, elle a li\u00e9 ses conversations \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, soit en ao\u00fbt 1996. Elle s'est alors ravis\u00e9e, affirmant qu'elle avait rencontr\u00e9 M. Beckstead en juillet ou ao\u00fbt 1996, M. Teisegger en mars 1996 et M. Morton, deux ou trois semaines plus tard.\n[140] Il est difficile de voir clair \u00e0 travers les contradictions dans cette preuve. Si ces conversations ont eu lieu en 1996, cela faisait belle lurette que M. Holt n'\u00e9tait plus surveillant de nuit. M. Holt a quitt\u00e9 Gibson en avril 1996. Si je fais mienne l'affirmation de Mme Lawrence, \u00e0 savoir que les actes de harc\u00e8lement ont cess\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 1995, comment peut-on expliquer le message concernant Chris Reid envoy\u00e9 par radiomessagerie satellite en septembre 1995.\n[141] Malgr\u00e9 ces contradictions, je crois que la preuve confirme la conclusion que Mme Laronde a effectivement parl\u00e9 aux cadres mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus. Gibson n'a pas vraiment contest\u00e9 la chose. J'ai conclu que ces discussions ont eu lieu \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 en 1995 ou 1996, ou au cours de ces deux ann\u00e9es-l\u00e0.\n[142] Il reste quatre incidents \u00e0 examiner en ce qui concerne le harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Le premier a trait aux inscriptions que M. Holt aurait faites sur l'enveloppe des voyages de Mme Laronde - [TRADUCTION] Ai-je fait du caf\u00e9 frais pour Steve?. Mme Laronde consid\u00e9rait ce message comme un rappel constant de son \u00e9tat de servilit\u00e9. Il ne fait aucun doute que cette remarque peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme d\u00e9gradante, comme indiquant la place de la femme. Elle pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme sexiste plut\u00f4t que comme de nature sexuelle. Cependant, aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente analyse, je supposerai qu'il s'agit d'une conduite ayant des connotations sexuelles.\n[143] Le message concernant Chris Neil qui attendait Mme Laronde pour lui faire la passe rev\u00eat certes un caract\u00e8re sexuel. M. Holt a reconnu avoir envoy\u00e9 ce message, mais ce \u00e0 la demande de M. Reid, un bon ami de Mme Laronde. La version de Mme Laronde est toute autre. Je n'ai point \u00e0 choisir entre les deux versions. C'est M. Holt qui contr\u00f4lait le syst\u00e8me de radiomessagerie par satellite et c'est lui qui a pris la d\u00e9cision d'envoyer le message. Si elle avait voulu \u00e9tablir qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un message inopportun mais plut\u00f4t d'une plaisanterie entre amis, Gibson aurait pu citer M. Reid comme t\u00e9moin.\n[144] Le troisi\u00e8me incident est celui du r\u00e9servoir de carburant. Mme Laronde a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle se trouvait dans la salle des conducteurs lorsque M. Holt a racont\u00e9 l'histoire. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 offens\u00e9e par cette histoire. D'apr\u00e8s la description que M. Holt a faite de la salle des conducteurs, on pourrait croire qu'il y r\u00e9gnait une atmosph\u00e8re quelque peu grivoise. Cela ne veut pas dire pour autant que Mme Laronde approuvait ce qui s'y passait; cependant, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, de temps \u00e0 autre, elle n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 l'abri des agissements grivois.\n[145] Je ferai ici r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 deux \u00e9v\u00e9nements cit\u00e9s en preuve, soit l'apr\u00e8s-party de No\u00ebl de 1995 chez Gibson et les c\u00e9l\u00e9brations en marge de l'anniversaire de Bob Gauley au Crossroads. Apr\u00e8s le party de No\u00ebl, un certain nombre de conducteurs, dont Mme Laronde, ont lou\u00e9 des chambres au Red Pines Inn, \u00e0 Alliston. Le groupe s'est rassembl\u00e9 dans la chambre de Mme Laronde et a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 convaincre \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 un Bob Gauley tr\u00e8s \u00e9m\u00e9ch\u00e9 de rev\u00eatir la robe que portait lors du party Mme Laronde (qui avait chang\u00e9 de tenue depuis), laquelle \u00e9tait orn\u00e9e d'un bouquet de corsage et de guirlandes de No\u00ebl. Des photographies de la sc\u00e8ne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. Mme Laronde et d'autres personnes ont montr\u00e9 ces photographies dans la cour \u00e0 Alliston, au grand dam de M. Gauley, mais au plus grand plaisir (M. Gauley \u00e9tait un homme de forte taille) des autres conducteurs.\n[146] \u00c0 une autre occasion, un certain nombre de conducteurs, dont Mme Laronde, ont c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9 l'anniversaire de Bob Gauley dans un restaurant puis au Crossroads, un club de danseuses nues situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Barrie. Mme Laronde a dit que le divertissement consistait en grande partie \u00e0 payer des danses-contacts \u00e0 M. Gauley. Elle a reconnu que des femmes presque nues s'assoyaient sur les genoux de M. Gauley. Mme Laronde a cotis\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9serve constitu\u00e9e pour payer les danses-contacts.\n[147] Si je cite ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, ce n'est pas pour laisser croire que Mme Laronde acceptait les comportements de nature sexuelle dans son milieu de travail ou fermait les yeux sur ceux-ci. Par ailleurs, au regard de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, il semble que Mme Laronde tol\u00e9rait jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point les comportements ayant des connotations sexuelles.\n[148] Comme l'a affirm\u00e9 M. Holt, les camionneurs sont des conteurs d'histoires. Il a racont\u00e9 une histoire dans laquelle il se vantait de ses prouesses sexuelles. Ce fait comporte une connotation sexuelle. Cependant, le r\u00e9cit n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 l'intention de Mme Laronde et celle-ci n'en faisait pas l'objet.\n[149] Les propos rapport\u00e9s par Gary Kitchener au sujet de ce que M. Holt disait de Mme Laronde, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il allait faire cong\u00e9dier cette chienne, sont offensants et blessants pour les femmes. Les commentaires n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faits directement \u00e0 Mme Laronde, mais lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9s par M. Kitchener environ un mois plus tard.\n[150] Mme Laronde s'est \u00e9galement plainte de ce que M. Holt la surveillait au moyen du satellite. Elle a cit\u00e9 trois incidents, soit la fois o\u00f9 elle est revenue \u00e0 la maison dans le camion en juin 1995, le trajet de retour depuis Vincennes et le message concernant les 235 milles parcourus en neuf heures. Je ne vois ni de connotations sexuelles ni de lien de nature sexuelle entre ces trois incidents. M. Holt a affirm\u00e9 qu'il surveillait le camion et non le conducteur. Il ne surveillait les conducteurs au moyen du satellite qu'en cas de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Les messages transmis lors du trajet \u00e0 partir de Vincennes constituent un bon exemple. M. Holt a envoy\u00e9 ces messages parce que Gibson avait besoin du camion de Mme Laronde et qu'il fallait le ramener bien avant l'heure de retour pr\u00e9vue.\n[151] Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 quant aux raisons pour lesquelles M. Holt a envoy\u00e9 le message au sujet du temps pris pour franchir la distance de 235 milles, ou aux raisons pour lesquelles Mme Laronde avait fait l'objet d'une surveillance par satellite lorsqu'elle s'est rendue chez elle dans son camion. En revanche, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit pour d\u00e9montrer que Mme Laronde avait fait l'objet d'une surveillance par satellite plus \u00e9troite que tout autre conducteur de Gibson. \u00c0 mon avis, aucun de ces trois incidents ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant de nature sexuelle.\n[152] Suite \u00e0 cette analyse, il reste quatre incidents qui peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant de nature sexuelle : l'enveloppe des voyages; l'incident du r\u00e9servoir de carburant; l'incident Chris Reid; l'incident du cong\u00e9diement de la chienne. Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne s'agisse d'une conduite tr\u00e8s grave, un incident unique ou isol\u00e9 au cours duquel des remarques sexuelles offensantes sont formul\u00e9es, ne suffit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile ou pr\u00e9judiciable. \u00c0 mon avis, aucune de ces remarques, consid\u00e9r\u00e9es individuellement, n'\u00e9tait grave au point d'avoir un tel effet. En outre, ces remarques, prises collectivement, ne laissent entrevoir aucun sch\u00e8me de comportement d\u00e9notant une conduite offensante. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ces incidents se sont \u00e9chelonn\u00e9s sur une p\u00e9riode d'au moins 18 mois comprise entre mars 1994 et septembre 1995.\n[153] Pour ces motifs, j'ai conclu que la Commission et la plaignante n'ont pas fait la preuve que l'art. 14 de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreint.\n(iii) Non-accession au rang de propri\u00e9taire-exploitant [154] Le dernier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la plainte de Mme Laronde est qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e pour devenir l'un des propri\u00e9taires-exploitants. Les propri\u00e9taires-exploitants sont une cat\u00e9gorie de conducteurs particuli\u00e8re chez Gibson. Ce sont des titulaires de permis de conduire de cat\u00e9gorie AZ qui poss\u00e8dent leur propre camion-tracteur et qui assument le co\u00fbt de leur carburant, de leur plaque d'immatriculation et des assurances ainsi que leur part des primes de la CSPAAT et du r\u00e9gime d'avantages sociaux.\n[155] En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Gibson passe avec chaque propri\u00e9taire-exploitant un contrat d'un an, qui est automatiquement reconduit, \u00e0 moins qu'un pr\u00e9avis de deux semaines ne soit donn\u00e9 avant la date d'expiration. Cependant, l'une ou l'autre partie peut mettre fin au contrat en tout temps moyennant un pr\u00e9avis de deux semaines. En vertu du contrat, le propri\u00e9taire-exploitant s'engage \u00e0 travailler exclusivement pour Gibson. Le propri\u00e9taire-exploitant est le conducteur principal du v\u00e9hicule, sauf lorsqu'il est en vacances ou malade ou lorsque des impr\u00e9vus surviennent, auquel cas des conducteurs de rel\u00e8ve prennent le volant. Les propri\u00e9taires-exploitants sont affect\u00e9s uniquement aux trajets am\u00e9ricains (section \u00c9tats-Unis).\n[156] Vers janvier 1996, Mme Laronde a dit \u00e0 Mme Lawrence qu'elle \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 devenir propri\u00e9taire-exploitant. On lui a dit d'inscrire son nom sur la liste afin que la direction sache qu'elle \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e et d'attendre.\n[157] Selon Mme Laronde, Rick Beckstead lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 le 28 mars 1996 pour lui demander si elle \u00e9tait encore int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 devenir propri\u00e9taire-exploitante. Il lui a dit que Gibson allait recruter \u00e0 m\u00eame son bassin de conducteurs et que sa candidature \u00e9tait examin\u00e9e. Mme Laronde a compris qu'elle serait choisie si elle r\u00e9pondait aux crit\u00e8res. Elle s'\u00e9tait entretenue avec un concessionnaire de camions au d\u00e9but de janvier 1996 en pr\u00e9vision de son accession au rang de propri\u00e9taire-exploitant.\n[158] Toutefois, le 29 mars, soit le jour suivant, M. Beckstead lui a dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle aille acheter un camion. Elle a appris que Gibson avait s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 quatre conducteurs comme propri\u00e9taires-exploitants, soit Scott Armstrong, Chad Horan, Ken Johnson et Warren Snell.\n[159] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, elle a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que Gibson avait choisi, en ao\u00fbt 1996, trois autres conducteurs comme propri\u00e9taires-exploitants. Norrie Sarcen \u00e9tait du nombre; toutefois, elle n'a pu se rappeler des autres noms. Le cas de Mme Laronde n'a m\u00eame pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9. Selon Mme Lawrence, sa candidature n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en compte parce que son rendement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux normes de l'entreprise. En outre, elle ne faisait pas partie de la section \u00c9tats-Unis. Les propri\u00e9taires-exploitants sont affect\u00e9s exclusivement aux trajets am\u00e9ricains.\n[160] Il y avait toujours chez Gibson un certain nombre de conducteurs d\u00e9sireux de poss\u00e9der leur propre v\u00e9hicule. Avant 1996, il n'existait aucun document que les conducteurs pouvaient consulter au sujet des exigences \u00e0 satisfaire pour devenir un propri\u00e9taire-exploitant au sein de la compagnie. En 1996, apr\u00e8s plusieurs rencontres avec les propri\u00e9taires, Mme Lawrence a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un document intitul\u00e9 Broker Requirements. Ce document \u00e9nonce un certain nombre de crit\u00e8res auxquels un conducteur doit r\u00e9pondre pour que sa candidature puisse \u00eatre examin\u00e9e. Parmi ces crit\u00e8res figurent ceux qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s : faire partie de la section \u00c9tats-Unis; avoir une bonne attitude; \u00eatre capable de financer l'achat d'un nouveau camion d'une certaine taille et couleur; travailler \u00e0 temps plein chez Gibson depuis au moins deux ans.\n[161] Les propri\u00e9taires estimaient que le document d\u00e9crivant les exigences \u00e0 satisfaire constituaient un point de d\u00e9part et se r\u00e9servaient le droit de prendre la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive quant aux candidats \u00e0 s\u00e9lectionner et au moment de faire les nominations.\n[162] Mme Lawrence avait l'habitude de dresser une liste des conducteurs int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 devenir propri\u00e9taire-exploitant. En temps utile, elle remettait la liste aux conducteurs charg\u00e9s de faire la s\u00e9lection. Dans le cas des conducteurs s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s en mars et ao\u00fbt 1996, c'est Bing Gibson qui a pris les d\u00e9cisions.\n[163] Mme Lawrence a admis qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans le document Brokers Requirements qu'on tiendrait compte des incidents mettant en cause les conducteurs. Toutefois, elle a affirm\u00e9 que tout propri\u00e9taire-exploitant doit avoir une fiche irr\u00e9prochable du point de vue op\u00e9rationnel. Il doit \u00eatre un conducteur fiable qui conna\u00eet les politiques et les proc\u00e9dures de l'entreprise et qui s'y conforme. Les candidats qui n'ont pas un bon dossier ne peuvent \u00eatre admis comme propri\u00e9taires-exploitants parce qu'ils n'ont pas fait leurs preuves comme conducteurs de la compagnie.\n[164] Bing Gibson a expliqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage comment il prenait les d\u00e9cisions. \u00c0 son avis, pour devenir un propri\u00e9taire-exploitant, il faut avoir une belle personnalit\u00e9. Il faut \u00eatre \u00e0 l'heure tout le temps. Il faut \u00eatre capable de financer l'achat du camion et de faire les versements. Il faut avoir un penchant pour la m\u00e9canique et \u00eatre capable de r\u00e9parer son camion. C'est l\u00e0 un facteur important qui influe sur les co\u00fbts d'exploitation et qui joue un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant dans la r\u00e9ussite de l'entrepreneur.\n[165] En ce qui concerne les quatre propri\u00e9taires-exploitants choisis, Chad Horan \u00e9tait au service de l'entreprise depuis le 10 novembre 1994. Bing Gibson avait connu son grand-p\u00e8re et son p\u00e8re et il connaissait Chad personnellement. De plus, Chad est le neveu de Leonard Gibson, l'un des propri\u00e9taires de la compagnie. Selon Bing Gibson, il a grandi avec l'entreprise et constituait un choix incontournable.\n[166] Warren Snell a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par Gibson en septembre 1988. Bing Gibson a dit qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire-exploitant parce qu'il aimait l'endroit dont M. Snell \u00e9tait originaire - Mona. M. Snell est aussi un op\u00e9rateur de machines lourdes et conna\u00eet la machinerie lourde. Il n'a pas caus\u00e9 de probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 l'entreprise. Il jouissait de l'appui de son p\u00e8re et sa maison \u00e9tait pay\u00e9e. Il \u00e9tait toujours \u00e0 l'heure, \u00e9l\u00e9ment auquel Gibson attache beaucoup d'importance.\n[167] Scott Armstrong a d\u00e9but\u00e9 comme conducteur chez Gibson le 29 avril 1994. Bing Gibson connaissait son p\u00e8re, avec lequel il avait fait des affaires. Il connaissait depuis 15 ans la famille de Scott Armstrong au moment o\u00f9 celui-ci s'est joint \u00e0 l'entreprise. Les Armstrong sont des agriculteurs. Ce sont de bonnes gens et il n'y avait, selon Bing Gibson, aucune raison de ne pas le choisir comme propri\u00e9taire-exploitant.\n[168] Ken Johnson est entr\u00e9 au service de Gibson en 1992. Bing Gibson a fait remarquer qu'il avait souvent vu M. Johnson en train de laver et de frotter son camion lorsqu'il \u00e9tait chez lui. Il passait beaucoup de temps \u00e0 s'assurer que son v\u00e9hicule \u00e9tait immacul\u00e9. Cela impressionnait Bing Gibson. M. Johnson \u00e9tait toujours \u00e0 l'heure. Il jouissait d'appuis financiers.\na) Analyse et conclusion [169] La Commission a fait valoir que, compte tenu des exigences \u00e0 satisfaire pour devenir propri\u00e9taire-exploitant, Mme Laronde \u00e9tait aussi comp\u00e9tente que n'importe laquelle des quatre autres personnes s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es. Le seul trait distinctif \u00e9tait le sexe, les autres personnes \u00e9tant des hommes.\n[170] La Commission a soutenu que le sexe de Mme Laronde \u00e9tait l'explication logique pour laquelle elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie comme propri\u00e9taire-exploitant. \u00c0 l'appui de cet argument, la Commission a cit\u00e9 deux affaires - Basi c. CNR (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, et Stakes c. Rex Pak Limited, (1982) 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001.\n[171] Le principe d\u00e9coulant de ces affaires veut que si la partie plaignante avait les qualifications pour le poste en cause et qu'une autre personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui n'avait pas le trait qui la distingue, a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e, il incombe \u00e0 l'employeur de fournir une explication cr\u00e9dible pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re d'embauche.\n[172] Le fait est que ni Mme Laronde ni M. Horan ni M. Armstrong ni M. Johnson ne satisfaisaient \u00e0 toutes les exigences \u00e0 remplir pour devenir propri\u00e9taires-exploitants. En mars 1996, Mme Laronde, M. Horan et M. Armstrong ne justifiaient pas de deux ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein de l'entreprise. Selon Mme Laronde, MM. Horan et Johnson n'\u00e9taient pas affect\u00e9s aux trajets aux \u00c9tats-Unis \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Quant \u00e0 M. Snell, ses qualifications n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9es.\n[173] En supposant que les exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le document Broker Requirements aient \u00e9t\u00e9 plus que de simples lignes directrices, la question qu'il faut se poser est la suivante : Gibson a-t-elle exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en s\u00e9lectionnant ces trois personnes, et non Mme Laronde, alors qu'aucune d'elles ne satisfaisait \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res d\u00e9finis dans le document Broker Requirements.\n[174] Bing Gibson a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Chad Horan \u00e9tait un des neveux du propri\u00e9taire, qu'il faisait partie de la famille et qu'il avait grandi avec l'entreprise. C'\u00e9tait un choix incontournable. Bing Gibson connaissait la famille de Scott Armstrong. Il avait fait des affaires avec son p\u00e8re et son grand-p\u00e8re. C'\u00e9tait de bonnes gens. Ken Johnson prenait un soin jaloux de son camion, ce qui impressionnait Bing Gibson. Il \u00e9tait toujours \u00e0 l'heure. Il jouissait d'appuis financiers.\n[175] Ces facteurs ne sont peut-\u00eatre pas ceux sur lesquels d'autres personnes s'appuieraient pour prendre leurs d\u00e9cisions. Toutefois, aux yeux de Bing Gibson, ces consid\u00e9rations \u00e9taient importantes du point de vue commercial. \u00c0 mon avis, rien dans la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme un pr\u00e9texte pour ne pas avoir choisi Mme Laronde en raison de son sexe. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que Gibson n'a pas exerc\u00e9 de discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Laronde et n'a pas contrevenu \u00e0 l'art. 14 de la Loi.\nIII. MESURES DE REDRESSEMENT A. PERTES SALARIALES [176] Lorsqu'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il y a eu discrimination, le tribunal doit faire en sorte de remettre la victime dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire, en tenant compte des principes de l'att\u00e9nuation des pertes, de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 raisonnable et du caract\u00e8re lointain du dommage - Canada c. Morgan, [1989] 2 C.F. 401 (C.A.) et Canada c. McAlpine, [1989] 3 C.F. 530 (C.A.).\n[177] En ce qui concerne les pertes salariales, la Commission a soutenu que si Gibson n'avait pas exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Laronde, celle-ci n'aurait pas re\u00e7u de dernier avertissement et l'entreprise n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi le 2 octobre 1996. La Commission a demand\u00e9 au tribunal de l'indemniser de ses pertes salariales. Selon elle, la p\u00e9riode indemnisable est d'une dur\u00e9e de 29 mois, soit la p\u00e9riode durant laquelle Mme Laronde a travaill\u00e9 chez Gibson.\n[178] L'entreprise intim\u00e9e, Gibson, s'appuyant sur le principe du pr\u00e9avis raisonnable d\u00e9coulant de la jurisprudence relative aux cong\u00e9diements injustes, a indiqu\u00e9 qu'une p\u00e9riode de deux mois et demi serait convenable.\n[179] Dans Morgan, la Cour d'appel a fait remarquer qu'on ne devrait pas appliquer les principes li\u00e9s aux cong\u00e9diements injustes dans les affaires relatives aux droits de la personne lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer le d\u00e9dommagement. C'est parce que la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'employeur en cas de cong\u00e9diement injuste d\u00e9coule du fait qu'il n'a pas donn\u00e9 un pr\u00e9avis suffisant, et non du traitement discriminatoire. La source de la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tant diff\u00e9rente, les cons\u00e9quences doivent l'\u00eatre \u00e9galement.\n[180] Quant \u00e0 l'argument de la Commission, il ne tient pas compte des faits pertinents survenus entre les deux. La preuve a permis d'\u00e9tablir que Mme Laronde a termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s son ann\u00e9e de probation et qu'elle avait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment un dossier sans tache. Comme l'a fait remarquer l'avocat de Gibson, il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 de m\u00eame pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre juin 1995 et mai 1996. Cependant, entre mai et septembre 1996, il y a eu une augmentation notable du nombre de manquements \u00e0 la discipline. Mme Laronde \u00e9tait en train de se constituer un dossier disciplinaire qui compromettait son emploi.\n[181] Le 2 octobre 1996, Mme Laronde avait dans son dossier trois incidents graves, deux infractions relatives au non-respect des heures de service et une omission d'inspecter un chargement. Selon les r\u00e8gles de la compagnie, elle s'exposait \u00e0 voir celle-ci mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Toutefois, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Gibson n'appliquait pas rigoureusement les r\u00e8gles, particuli\u00e8rement celles concernant la cessation d'emploi. Le fait que les deux infractions relatives aux heures de service seraient disparues du dossier disciplinaire de Mme Laronde dans les semaines qui allaient suivre est un autre facteur \u00e0 prendre en compte. Par ailleurs, la preuve indique que les infractions relatives aux heures de service n'\u00e9taient pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme aussi graves que d'autres genres d'infractions aux r\u00e8gles d'exploitation.\n[182] Au regard de l'ensemble de ces facteurs, je suis d'avis qu'il convient de calculer les pertes salariales en se fondant sur une p\u00e9riode de neuf mois. Mme Laronde doit \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement indemnis\u00e9e des pertes salariales qu'elle a subies au cours des neuf mois qui ont suivi la date de son renvoi. Il y a lieu de d\u00e9duire du total ses revenus provenant d'autres sources.\n[183] Mme Laronde a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire au titre des pertes salariales. Il se peut que le versement de cette indemnit\u00e9 entra\u00eene des cons\u00e9quences fiscales n\u00e9gatives. Il serait injuste de la p\u00e9naliser en lui imposant un fardeau fiscal plus lourd par suite du paiement d'une somme forfaitaire en lieu et place des versements salariaux qu'elle aurait re\u00e7us entre octobre 1996 et la date du paiement. Par cons\u00e9quent, Gibson doit verser \u00e0 Mme Laronde une somme suppl\u00e9mentaire suffisante pour compenser l'imp\u00f4t additionnel qu'elle aura \u00e0 payer du fait qu'elle recevra un paiement forfaitaire.\nB. INDEMNIT\u00c9 SP\u00c9CIALE [184] Le paragraphe 53 (3) de la Loi, tel que libell\u00e9 en octobre 1996, permettait d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 5 000 $ en cas de conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e, de pr\u00e9judice moral ou d'atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 personnelle. Il n'y a pas d'all\u00e9gations de conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e de la part de Gibson.\n[185] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que Mme Laronde a \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9e \u00e0 de tr\u00e8s grandes difficult\u00e9s apr\u00e8s que Gibson eut mis fin \u00e0 son emploi. Elle n'avait pas de gagne-pain. Elle \u00e9tait chef de famille monoparentale et avait trois enfants \u00e0 charge. Sa m\u00e8re, qui \u00e9tait dans l'incapacit\u00e9 de gagner sa vie, faisait elle aussi partie du m\u00e9nage de Mme Laronde \u00e0 titre de personne \u00e0 charge. Le stress qu'elle a subi par suite de la perte de son emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 amplifi\u00e9 par les pressions financi\u00e8res auxquelles elle \u00e9tait soumise.\n[186] Mme Laronde a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle s'\u00e9tait aussit\u00f4t mise \u00e0 la recherche d'un emploi de conducteur de camions. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de trouver un emploi \u00e0 temps plein qui lui aurait procur\u00e9 un salaire similaire \u00e0 celui qu'elle touchait chez Gibson. L'emploi \u00e0 temps plein qu'elle a d\u00e9nich\u00e9 \u00e9tait de courte dur\u00e9e.\n[187] Au regard de l'ensemble des circonstances, j'accorde \u00e0 Mme Laronde une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 5 000 $.\nC. INT\u00c9R\u00caTS [188] Selon la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e pour compenser des pertes salariales donne droit \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats. Le calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats doit porter sur la p\u00e9riode allant du 2 octobre 1996 \u00e0 la date du paiement et \u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur les versements salariaux qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 Mme Laronde.\nD. FRAIS REMBOURSABLES [189] Mme Laronde doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e des frais remboursables qu'elle a subis par suite de l'acte discriminatoire, y compris les frais engag\u00e9s pour assister \u00e0 l'audience dans cette affaire.\n[190] Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence pour le cas o\u00f9 les parties ne seraient pas en mesure de s'entendre dans les 30 jours suivant la date de cette d\u00e9cision sur l'une des quelconques mesures de redressement et notamment sur le calcul des indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9e par J.

INTRODUCTION [1] La question que soul\u00e8ve cette requ\u00eate est la suivante : la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne peut-elle, dans le cadre d'une audience du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, pr\u00e9senter un expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire au d\u00e9but de l'audience consistant principalement en un aper\u00e7u g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'\u00e9tat du droit applicable, puis se retirer de l'audience tout en se r\u00e9servant le droit d'y participer \u00e0 nouveau ult\u00e9rieurement?\n[2] La fa\u00e7on dont la Commission entend proc\u00e9der en l'esp\u00e8ce repr\u00e9sente un changement fondamental par rapport \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont elle a traditionnellement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public devant le Tribunal. Les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (FAC) ont contest\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der de la Commission, faisant valoir qu'elle serait fondamentalement pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 son droit de se d\u00e9fendre \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9e dans cette affaire.\nII. HISTORIQUE DES FAITS [3] Donna Mowat a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de discrimination contre les FAC. Dans sa plainte, elle all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement sexuel dans le cours de son emploi au sein des FAC. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait enqu\u00eate sur la plainte de Mme Mowat, la Commission l'a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[4] Au cours de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire convoqu\u00e9e par le Tribunal, l'avocat de la Commission a inform\u00e9 les autres parties que celle-ci n'entendait pas participer \u00e0 toute l'audience et se contenterait de compara\u00eetre au d\u00e9but pour pr\u00e9senter un expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire. Dans un \u00e9change de correspondance subs\u00e9quent, la Commission a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle avait l'intention de pr\u00e9senter un expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire au d\u00e9but de l'audience :\n[TRADUCTION] ... analysant les consid\u00e9rations d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans l'affaire en question. Dans sa d\u00e9claration, la Commission pr\u00e9sentera son opinion au sujet des questions de droit en cause ainsi qu'une description d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de l'\u00e9tat du droit par rapport \u00e0 la plainte. L'avocat de la Commission ne sera pas pr\u00e9sent pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de l'audience...\n[5] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u cette explication, les FAC ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal une requ\u00eate lui demandant de statuer que la m\u00e9thode de participation propos\u00e9e par la Commission est inappropri\u00e9e et pr\u00e9judiciable aux FAC. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, les FAC s'opposent \u00e0 ce que la Commission pr\u00e9sente un tel expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire sans avoir \u00e0 \u00e9tayer ses arguments par des faits prouv\u00e9s devant le Tribunal. En outre, les FAC s'opposent au fait que la Commission n'a pas communiqu\u00e9 aux parties les d\u00e9tails de sa position pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 l'audience, comme l'exigent les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Les FAC demandent au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance interdisant \u00e0 la Commission de participer \u00e0 l'audience de la mani\u00e8re dont elle entend le faire, ainsi qu'une ordonnance exigeant qu'elle divulgue l'essence de sa position avant l'audience.\n[6] Au cours d'une deuxi\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence, le vice-pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, Grant Sinclair, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de bien vouloir transmettre aux parties un exemplaire de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire qu'elle entend pr\u00e9senter afin que le bien-fond\u00e9 de cet expos\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre examin\u00e9 dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate. Un exemplaire du projet d'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire de la Commission est annex\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nIII. QUESTION PR\u00c9JUDICIELLE [7] Avant de se pencher sur le fond de la requ\u00eate des FAC, le Tribunal doit examiner la question pr\u00e9liminaire suivante : le Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence pour se prononcer sur la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission entend participer \u00e0 l'audience?\n[8] La Commission pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal n'est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9viser les d\u00e9cisions qu'elle prend en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que seule la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a un pouvoir de surveillance sur la Commission. \u00c0 son avis, la Commission, en sa qualit\u00e9 de partie ind\u00e9pendante qui compara\u00eet devant le Tribunal, jouit du pouvoir inconditionnel de comparution \u00e0 une audience. L'article 50 de la Loi conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Commission la qualit\u00e9 de partie, pr\u00e9cisant clairement, selon la pr\u00e9tention de la CCDP, que [TRADUCTION] la Commission n'a pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter de requ\u00eate au Tribunal... pour qu'il se penche sur l'ampleur de sa participation. La Commission soutient qu'il serait illogique, compte tenu de son statut de partie ind\u00e9pendante, que le Tribunal tente de r\u00e9viser la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission a choisi de repr\u00e9senter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[9] M\u00eame si les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la Commission au moment de l'audition des requ\u00eates \u00e9taient r\u00e9dig\u00e9es en termes non \u00e9quivoques, l'avocat de la Commission a admis que le Tribunal, du fait qu'il est ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure, a la haute main sur le processus d'audience et le pouvoir de prendre des mesures lorsque la conduite d'une partie aurait pour effet de causer une injustice \u00e0 une autre partie. Par exemple, l'avocat de la Commission a admis que le Tribunal aurait le loisir de demander \u00e0 la Commission de pr\u00e9senter son r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tat du droit \u00e0 la fin de l'audience plut\u00f4t qu'au commencement de celle-ci.\n[10] Les FAC conviennent que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de participer \u00e0 une instance peut l\u00e9gitimement faire l'objet d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et non pas du Tribunal. Cependant, les FAC soutiennent que lorsqu'elle compara\u00eet devant le Tribunal, la Commission doit se conformer aux principes de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du TCDP.\n[11] Comme l'a fait remarquer pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment le Tribunal, il appartient \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9terminer la meilleure fa\u00e7on de s'acquitter du mandat de repr\u00e9sentation de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public que lui conf\u00e8re l'article 51 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne 1. Le Tribunal ne saurait pr\u00eater des intentions \u00e0 la Commission \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En fait, il incombe \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de r\u00e9viser les d\u00e9cisions prises par la Commission dans certains cas individuels2.\n[12] Cela \u00e9tant dit, la Commission n'est pas libre d'agir \u00e0 sa guise lorsqu'elle compara\u00eet devant le Tribunal et elle ne peut faire fi des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du TCDP, des r\u00e8gles d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et des droits des autres parties \u00e0 l'instance. La Commission, \u00e0 l'instar des autres parties, est soumise aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du TCDP et \u00e0 toute d\u00e9cision que rend le Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de preuve ou de proc\u00e9dure.\n[13] En tant qu'organisme juridictionnel qui se prononce sur les droits quasi constitutionnels garantis par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, le Tribunal a non seulement le pouvoir, mais aussi l'obligation, d'assurer l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. Ainsi, le Tribunal est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 emp\u00eacher, par exemple, la Commission de poser des questions suggestives lors de l'interrogatoire de ses propres t\u00e9moins, de produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve inadmissibles ou non pertinents ou de formuler des conclusions finales ayant trait \u00e0 des faits non pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement le pouvoir de veiller \u00e0 ce que toute observation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission dans une instance, lors de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire ou \u00e0 un autre moment, soit conforme aux principes de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9.\n[14] \u00c0 notre avis, la Commission se m\u00e9prend quant \u00e0 l'intention des FAC. L'objection des FAC n'implique pas une r\u00e9vision d'une d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Il s'agit plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer si la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission entend participer \u00e0 l'audience respecte les principes de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous sommes convaincus que le Tribunal est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre l'objection des FAC \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sentation par la Commission de son expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire.\nA. Position des FAC au sujet de la m\u00e9thode de participation propos\u00e9e par la Commission [15] Les FAC soutiennent que ce que propose la Commission va \u00e0 l'encontre du but de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire, qui vise \u00e0 donner au juge des faits un aper\u00e7u g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des faits et des questions en cause. En faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des faits particuliers dans l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire, l'avocat est implicitement soumis \u00e0 l'obligation professionnelle de veiller \u00e0 ce que les faits d\u00e9crits soient corrobor\u00e9s par la preuve.\n[16] M\u00eame si la Commission pr\u00e9tend qu'elle se contentera dans son expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire de donner ...son opinion sur les questions de droit en cause ainsi qu'une description d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de l'\u00e9tat du droit par rapport \u00e0 la plainte ..., les FAC affirment que l'examen de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire qu'entend pr\u00e9senter la Commission montre combien il est difficile de pr\u00e9senter des arguments de droit sans les rattacher aux faits en cause. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, les FAC attirent l'attention sur l'observation suivante que la Commission entend pr\u00e9senter :\n[TRADUCTION] Il ne fait aucun doute que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est non seulement une pr\u00e9occupation particuli\u00e8re pour les femmes, mais aussi une question d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Il s'agit d'un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne omnipr\u00e9sent dans le milieu de travail, le gouvernement, les \u00e9coles, les cabinets de droit, la profession m\u00e9dicale, l'arm\u00e9e, les milieux sportifs et les institutions culturelles.\n[17] Cela d\u00e9montre que la Commission a l'intention de laisser entendre au Tribunal qu'il existe un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique de harc\u00e8lement sexuel au sein de l'arm\u00e9e canadienne. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la Commission ne pr\u00e9voit pas d\u00e9poser de preuves en l'esp\u00e8ce, il est \u00e9vident qu'elle ne sera pas en mesure de prouver son all\u00e9gation. De l'avis des FAC, pr\u00e9senter une telle all\u00e9gation non \u00e9tay\u00e9e \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une inconduite professionnelle de la part de l'avocat de la Commission. De plus, une pareille affirmation serait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9judiciable aux FAC. Elle pourrait fort bien influencer le membre instructeur qui devra juger du bien-fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement sexuel de Mme Mowat, d'autant plus qu'elle serait formul\u00e9e par la Commission, partie dont l'expertise dans le domaine est reconnue.\n[18] Le fait de permettre \u00e0 la Commission de citer des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents \u00e0 propos d'une question particuli\u00e8re pourrait avoir pour effet de prolonger l'audience, car cela pourrait obliger les FAC \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer pourquoi la loi ne s'applique pas, m\u00eame si les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce ne soul\u00e8vent pas ladite question. Par exemple, la Commission a l'intention de citer les principes juridiques r\u00e9gissant le contenu d'une politique sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel. La conclusion naturelle que le Tribunal pourrait tirer, selon les FAC, est que leur politique sur le harc\u00e8lement comporte peut-\u00eatre des lacunes. La prudence pourrait alors exiger que les FAC pr\u00e9sentent les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9tablir formellement que leur politique \u00e9tait satisfaisante, m\u00eame si les faits r\u00e9els entourant l'affaire Mowat n'impliqueraient pas autrement de mettre en doute le caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat de cette politique.\n[19] En outre, la d\u00e9termination des principes juridiques qui sont pertinents pr\u00e9suppose une certaine compr\u00e9hension des faits de l'esp\u00e8ce de la part de la Commission. Par exemple, dans l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire qu'elle se propose de pr\u00e9senter, la Commission fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux principes juridiques relatifs \u00e0 la question des repr\u00e9sailles. Rien dans la plainte de Mme Mowat ne permet m\u00eame de croire que la question des repr\u00e9sailles se pose dans cette affaire. Seul l'expos\u00e9 des questions en litige de Mme Mowat fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon les FAC, la Commission, du fait qu'elle fait allusion \u00e0 la question des repr\u00e9sailles, doit tenir pour acquis les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par Mme Mowat.\n[20] La Commission soutient que son expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire est un aper\u00e7u neutre de l'\u00e9tat du droit destin\u00e9 \u00e0 aider les deux parties et le Tribunal. Les FAC contestent cette pr\u00e9tention, faisant remarquer notamment que la Commission n'a pas fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la jurisprudence du Tribunal pr\u00e9cisant que les dispositions de la loi en mati\u00e8re de repr\u00e9sailles n'ont pas d'effet r\u00e9troactif. Par cons\u00e9quent, ces dispositions ne s'appliqueraient pas aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant cette affaire, qui sont survenus avant juin 19983. Sous ce rapport, l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire de la Commission favorise injustement la plaignante au d\u00e9triment des FAC.\n[21] En outre, les FAC affirment que la Commission ne s'est pas conform\u00e9e aux obligations de divulgation impos\u00e9es aux parties en vertu des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. La Commission n'a pas avis\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable les parties de sa position quant aux motifs d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public en cause. Si le Tribunal n'avait pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9poser un exemplaire de son projet d'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire avant la pr\u00e9sentation de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, les FAC n'auraient eu, disent-elles, aucune id\u00e9e de la position de la Commission avant le premier jour de l'audience. De l'avis des FAC, cette situation est fondamentalement injuste.\n[22] Par ailleurs, les FAC soutiennent que le fait de permettre \u00e0 la Commission de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 nouveau durant l'audience leur serait pr\u00e9judiciable. Il leur est impossible ni de savoir si cette possibilit\u00e9 se concr\u00e9tisera et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quand, ni de d\u00e9terminer quelle serait la nature de la participation de la Commission. Les FAC ne peuvent donc pr\u00e9voir ni les questions qu'elles devraient peut-\u00eatre poser aux t\u00e9moins de la plaignante, ni les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu'elles devraient peut-\u00eatre produire en r\u00e9action \u00e0 la position que la Commission est susceptible d'adopter ult\u00e9rieurement au cours de l'audience.\n[23] Enfin, les FAC font valoir qu'un expos\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'\u00e9tat du droit qui n'est pas li\u00e9 aux faits en cause ne sera gu\u00e8re utile au Tribunal. Par ailleurs, le pr\u00e9judice que subiront les FAC si l'on autorise la pr\u00e9sentation de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire l'emportera sur l'utilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e de ce genre d'expos\u00e9.\nB. Position de la Commission [24] La Commission nie que le fait de l'autoriser \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter son expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire causera un pr\u00e9judice aux FAC. Selon elle, la plaignante et l'intim\u00e9e ont toutes deux \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9es t\u00f4t au cours du processus que la Commission entendait jouer un r\u00f4le restreint en l'esp\u00e8ce. De plus, au dire de la Commission, ses observations consisteront strictement en un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tat du droit applicable en l'esp\u00e8ce. La Commission estime qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le TCDP est un tribunal sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9, ses arguments au sujet du droit ne l'influenceront pas ind\u00fbment s'ils sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au d\u00e9but de l'audience.\n[25] La Commission conteste l'affirmation des FAC voulant qu'elle ait omis de pr\u00e9ciser les motifs d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans cette affaire. Selon la Commission, [TRADUCTION] l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public est en cause lorsqu'une plainte est renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal puisque la Commission est alors persuad\u00e9e que la plainte doit faire l'objet d'une proc\u00e9dure d'instruction plus pouss\u00e9e. La Commission est d'avis que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public exige de faire en sorte que les questions de droit pertinentes soient tranch\u00e9es et que les principes juridiques soient pleinement expos\u00e9s. Cela ne suppose pas que la Commission doive pr\u00e9senter une preuve dans une affaire donn\u00e9e.\n[26] L'avocat de la Commission pr\u00e9tend que le r\u00f4le de la CCDP, lorsqu'elle compara\u00eet devant le Tribunal, s'apparente \u00e0 celui du procureur de la Couronne. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la Commission ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 celui des autres parties. En fait, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la Commission est de voir \u00e0 ce que justice soit faite. Cependant, l'avocat de la Commission a admis que bien que l'examen de l'\u00e9tat du droit de la CCDP se veuille neutre, la Commission n'est pas infaillible.\n[27] De plus, la Commission pr\u00e9tend que son examen de l'\u00e9tat du droit vise \u00e0 aider non seulement le Tribunal mais aussi les parties \u00e0 comprendre l'\u00e9tat du droit pertinent \u00e0 l'affaire dont il s'agit. Tout en reconnaissant qu'un aper\u00e7u g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des principes relatifs aux droits de la personne ne sera gu\u00e8re utile \u00e0 un tribunal sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 qui a une connaissance approfondie de la l\u00e9gislation en la mati\u00e8re, la Commission est d\u00e9sireuse de s'assurer que les parties qui comparaissent devant le Tribunal connaissent la jurisprudence pertinente.\n[28] La Commission reconna\u00eet qu'il est inacceptable qu'une partie fasse r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans un expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 des faits qu'elle ne prouvera pas. Selon la Commission, l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire qu'elle entend pr\u00e9senter traite strictement de faits non litigieux et, partant, ne met pas en cause la r\u00e8gle de l'engagement implicite. Tout en admettant que le fait de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique de harc\u00e8lement sexuel dans l'arm\u00e9e canadienne est litigieux, la Commission est d'avis que l'affirmation est anodine et non pr\u00e9judiciable aux FAC. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, l'engagement implicite, d'affirmer la Commission, n'est rien de plus qu'une r\u00e8gle de pratique; il ne s'agit pas d'une r\u00e8gle de droit.\n[29] La Commission a fait valoir que le TCDP, en tant que tribunal administratif, n'est pas tenu de suivre les r\u00e8gles et les proc\u00e9dures qu'appliquent les cours. Le Tribunal devrait plut\u00f4t se montrer souple et novateur dans la tenue de ses audiences4, notamment en admettant ce que la Commission qualifie d'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire non traditionnelle.\n[30] Selon la Commission, les FAC n'ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la nature du pr\u00e9judice qu'elles subiront si la Commission pr\u00e9sente son expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire puis se retire de l'audience. Ses all\u00e9gations de pr\u00e9judice sont purement sp\u00e9culatives, au dire de la Commission; par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne saurait en tenir compte. Selon la Commission, [TRADUCTION] les FAC ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de se livrer \u00e0 un exercice de conjecture inappropri\u00e9 auquel les parties ont d\u00fb consacrer des ressources consid\u00e9rables. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, les FAC, au dire de la Commission, auront amplement l'occasion \u00e0 l'audience de r\u00e9pondre aux observations formul\u00e9es par la Commission dans son expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[31] Enfin, en ce qui concerne le fait qu'elle se r\u00e9serve le droit de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 nouveau durant l'audience, la Commission a reconnu qu'elle serait soumise aux directives du Tribunal et que les autres parties pourraient pr\u00e9senter des objections. Le Tribunal pourrait, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, s'interroger sur le pr\u00e9judice qui pourrait en r\u00e9sulter pour les FAC.\nC. Position de la plaignante [32] Selon l'avocat de la plaignante, il serait utile que cette derni\u00e8re connaisse l'opinion de la Commission quant aux motifs d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public que soul\u00e8ve sa plainte. L'avocat de la plaignante estime que la Commission est du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de sa cliente, qu'[TRADUCTION] avoir des alli\u00e9s ne fait jamais de tort et que la participation de la Commission, si limit\u00e9e soit-elle, aiderait \u00e0 [TRADUCTION] \u00e9galer les chances.\n[33] L'aper\u00e7u de l'\u00e9tat du droit fourni par la Commission est utile, au dire de l'avocat de la plaignante, car il l'a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 bien comprendre les questions en cause. Il souhaiterait que l'information que renferme l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal, mais il est sensible au pr\u00e9judice que pourraient subir les FAC si la Commission \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter ledit expos\u00e9.\n[34] Il n'importe pas \u00e0 l'avocat de Mme Mowat que la Commission fournisse les renseignements dans un expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire ou lors des plaidoiries. Toutefois, il lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile, a-t-il dit, de recevoir cette information de la part de la Commission beaucoup plus t\u00f4t dans le processus.\nIV. ANALYSE [35] Les principes juridiques r\u00e9gissant la teneur de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant une cour sont clairs. Dans Brochu v. Pond 5, la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario a r\u00e9cemment fait sienne l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 suivant qu'on trouve dans les Halsbury's Laws of England et que Me Sopinka a cit\u00e9 dans son ouvrage intitul\u00e9 The Trial of an Action 6 :\n[TRADUCTION] L'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire sert \u00e0 donner \u00e0 la cour un aper\u00e7u g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la preuve qui sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e... Dans cet expos\u00e9, l'avocat expose les points litigieux et les questions \u00e0 trancher, les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce et les grandes lignes de la preuve qu'il entend pr\u00e9senter, il explique dans quelle mesure cette preuve contribuera \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de la cause et renvoie \u00e0 la correspondance pertinente entre les parties ainsi qu'\u00e0 d'autres documents. Il formule des observations sur tout point de droit que l'affaire soul\u00e8ve; cependant, l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire ne se pr\u00eate pas \u00e0 une argumentation d\u00e9taill\u00e9e sur les questions de droit ou \u00e0 un vaste examen de la jurisprudence. Dans son expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire, l'avocat peut faire allusion aux faits dont la cour prend connaissance d'office. L'avocat ne peut pr\u00e9senter son opinion personnelle au sujet des faits ou du droit lors de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire ou \u00e0 un autre stade du proc\u00e8s, pas plus d'ailleurs qu'il ne peut faire allusion \u00e0 des faits qui doivent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9s, s'il n'a pas l'intention de le faire, ou \u00e0 des faits qui ne sont pas pertinents \u00e0 la question \u00e0 trancher.\n[36] De m\u00eame, dans l'\u00e9dition canadienne de l'ouvrage intitul\u00e9 Modern Trial Advocacy7, on peut lire l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 suivant :\n[TRADUCTION] Les cours et les auteurs affirment presque \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 que l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire sert exclusivement \u00e0 informer la cour [TRADUCTION] de ce que la preuve d\u00e9montrera. L'avocat ne peut plaider durant l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire; il doit s'en tenir \u00e0 un aper\u00e7u pr\u00e9liminaire des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus, des pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 d\u00e9poser et des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, ainsi qu'\u00e0 une br\u00e8ve description des questions litigieuses.\n[37] Il est vrai qu'une grande partie de la jurisprudence sur les param\u00e8tres de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire a trait \u00e0 des proc\u00e8s avec jury. Cependant, les principes pertinents sont d'application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Bien que l'avocat jouisse dans les proc\u00e8s sans jury d'une plus grande latitude lorsqu'il s'agit de cerner les questions de droit8, l'interdiction de faire mention de faits qu'il n'entend pas prouver demeure9. Il en va de m\u00eame de l'interdiction de pr\u00e9senter une argumentation juridique dans l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire10.\n[38] Les r\u00e8gles relatives au contenu appropri\u00e9 de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 au fil des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations et visent \u00e0 assurer l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 globale du proc\u00e8s. L'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire que la Commission entend pr\u00e9senter au d\u00e9but de l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9montre l'injustice que peut causer le fait d'autoriser les avocats \u00e0 s'\u00e9carter des param\u00e8tres formels de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[39] Contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend la Commission, l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire que la CCDP entend pr\u00e9senter traite de faits litigieux. L'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est un probl\u00e8me r\u00e9pandu dans l'arm\u00e9e canadienne peut difficilement \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e d'anodine. L'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne du harc\u00e8lement sexuel est omnipr\u00e9sent dans les FAC invite \u00e0 conclure que l'all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement sexuel port\u00e9e par Mme Mowat est fond\u00e9e. Une telle affirmation non \u00e9tay\u00e9e de la part de la Commission est nettement pr\u00e9judiciable aux FAC.\n[40] Nous partageons l'avis des FAC \u00e0 savoir que l'aper\u00e7u de l'\u00e9tat du droit fourni par la Commission n'est pas totalement neutre. Bien que la Commission affirme que son analyse de la jurisprudence n'est pas partisan et ne favorise ni un c\u00f4t\u00e9 ni l'autre, l'exemple cit\u00e9 par les FAC en ce qui touche la question des repr\u00e9sailles d\u00e9montre la difficult\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tat du droit qui soit vraiment non partisan.\n[41] La pr\u00e9sentation d'un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tat du droit est par ailleurs susceptible de compliquer l'audience. Lorsque les arguments de droit sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture de l'audience, les parties et le Tribunal comprennent clairement les faits et sont \u00e0 m\u00eame de distinguer les questions de droit qui sont pertinentes et celles qui ne le sont pas. Si une partie fait valoir des arguments sur un point de droit non pertinent, la partie adverse peut soulever une objection et le Tribunal est en mesure de trancher l'objection. Si la jurisprudence est examin\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail avant la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, le Tribunal n'est aucunement en mesure de savoir ce qui est pertinent et ce qui ne l'est pas. En cas d'objection, la Commission ne peut aider en expliquant la pertinence de ses arguments, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle ne peut faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux faits de l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[42] Nous faisons n\u00f4tres les arguments des FAC selon lesquels le fait d'autoriser la Commission \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter au d\u00e9but de l'audience un aper\u00e7u de ce qu'elle consid\u00e8re \u00eatre la jurisprudence pertinente lui causerait un pr\u00e9judice. La d\u00e9termination des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents qui sont pertinents \u00e0 l'affaire dont il s'agit pr\u00e9suppose l'existence de certains faits et, de surcro\u00eet, risquerait de prolonger l'audience. Bien que l'audience devrait durer le temps qu'il faut pour permettre amplement \u00e0 chaque partie de se faire entendre, on ne devrait pas \u00e0 notre avis permettre \u00e0 une partie de mettre sur la table des questions qui exigent une r\u00e9plique de la part d'une autre partie, puis de quitter l'audience sans avoir prouv\u00e9 que lesdites questions ont rapport \u00e0 l'affaire dont il s'agit.\n[43] Il convient de souligner que la Commission n'a pas fourni au Tribunal de raison satisfaisante qui justifierait une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale afin de lui permettre de pr\u00e9senter un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tat du droit au d\u00e9but de l'audience plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 la fin, comme le veut la coutume. La Commission a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il serait utile aux parties \u00e0 une plainte donn\u00e9e d'obtenir un aper\u00e7u des r\u00e8gles de droit que la Commission juge pertinentes. Cependant, rien n'emp\u00eache la Commission de pr\u00e9senter un tel r\u00e9sum\u00e9 aux parties \u00e0 n'importe quel moment au cours du processus d'audience.\n[44] Par ailleurs, la Commission a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 les obligations qui lui incombent en vertu des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Ces r\u00e8gles visent \u00e0 assurer la divulgation des pr\u00e9tentions et de la preuve de mani\u00e8re efficace et en temps opportun, afin que chaque partie connaisse, pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 l'audience, la preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer. \u00c0 cette fin, la r\u00e8gle 6 impose aux parties qui comparaissent devant le Tribunal certaines obligations de divulgation. Selon les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, la Commission et les FAC sont tenues de donner un avis \u00e9crit des faits mat\u00e9riels qu'elles entendent \u00e9tablir pour prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte, ainsi que des questions de droit que soul\u00e8ve l'affaire. La partie plaignante a des obligations similaires lorsque sa position diff\u00e8re de celle de la Commission. Les r\u00e8gles comportent \u00e9galement des dispositions en ce qui touche la divulgation pr\u00e9alable des documents ainsi que la production de listes de t\u00e9moins et de r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s.\n[45] On ne trouve dans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure aucune disposition qui oblige la Commission \u00e0 participer \u00e0 une instance. Rien n'oblige non plus la Commission \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, \u00e0 contre-interroger des t\u00e9moins de la partie adverse ou \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des arguments de droit. Il s'agit l\u00e0 de questions pour lesquelles la Commission doit prendre des d\u00e9cisions en fonction du mandat de repr\u00e9sentation de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public que lui conf\u00e8re l'article 51 de la Loi. Cependant, si la Commission d\u00e9cide de participer \u00e0 une audience, les autres parties ont le droit de conna\u00eetre, bien avant celle-ci, la position qu'elle y pr\u00e9sentera. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, les parties ont le droit de savoir quels sont, de l'avis de la Commission, les motifs d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans une instance particuli\u00e8re, afin de pouvoir pr\u00e9senter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u00e9cessaires et de faire valoir les arguments qu'elles jugent appropri\u00e9s, compte tenu de ces motifs.\n[46] Il ne suffit pas que la Commission dise que toute plainte renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal soul\u00e8ve des motifs d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. En l'esp\u00e8ce, Mme Mowat et les FAC, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intervention du Tribunal, n'auraient obtenu de la Commission avant le premier jour de l'audience aucune indication quant aux motifs qui, \u00e0 son avis, sont d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public en l'esp\u00e8ce. Cette fa\u00e7on de faire va \u00e0 l'encontre des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et n'est pas dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du processus.\nV. CONCLUSION ET ORDONNANCE [47] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, nous avons conclu que la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission entend participer \u00e0 l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce n'est conforme ni aux principes de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 ni aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission n'est pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter de la fa\u00e7on envisag\u00e9e l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire pr\u00e9vu. Le membre instructeur charg\u00e9 d'entendre le fond de la plainte tranchera toute question d\u00e9coulant de la d\u00e9cision.\nSign\u00e9 par\nJ.

Les observations ci-apr sont prents conforment lrticle51 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne [la Loi].\nLe rle dnt public ultime deCommission canadienne des droits de la personne est de promouvoir lbjet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne [la Loi], cst--dire donner effet au principe suivant: le droit de tous les individus [...] lgalit des chances dpanouissement [], indendamment des considations fonds sur la race, lrigine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, lge, le sexe, lrientation sexuelle, ltat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la dicience ou ltat de personne graci [...] [article2 de la Loi]\nEn rum, lnt public fondamental peut re drit comme la promotion de lgalit gre la raration de la discrimination pass et la prention de la discrimination future.\nLa Commission est dvis que la prente plainte soule dmportants principes en matie de droits de la personne, et nous profitons de lccasion pour passer en revue ces principes. En lspe, le Tribunal est appel examiner la lislation sur les droits de la personne par rapport a) lbligation dn employeur dffrir un milieu de travail exempt de harcement et la responsabilit qui doule de lmission de le faire, et b)au traitement diffentiel davorable accord par un employeur un individu et au refus de continuer de lmployer en raison de son sexe.\nDISPOSITIONS PERTINENTES DE LA LOI Aux termes de lrticle7 de la Loi, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser dmployer ou de continuer dmployer un individu ou de le davoriser en cours dmploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, sl est fond sur un motif de distinction illicite.\nLlin14(1)(c) de la Loi prise que le fait de harceler un individu en matie dmploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, sl est fond sur un motif de distinction illicite. Le paragraphe14(2) dispose que le harcement sexuel est rut re un harcement fond sur un motif de distinction illicite. Par consuent, le cadre statutaire conside le harcement sexuel comme une forme de discrimination sexuelle.\nEn vertu du paragraphe14.1 de la Loi, le fait, pour la personne vis par une plainte dos, dxercer ou de menacer dxercer des reprailles contre le plaignant constitue un acte discriminatoire.\nSelon le paragraphe65(1) de la Loi, lmployeur est responsable des actes discriminatoires commis par ses employ dans le cadre de leur emploi. Le paragraphe65(2) disculpe lmployeur sl ablit que lcte ou lmission a eu lieu sans son consentement, qul a pris toutes les mesures nessaires pour lmpher et que, par la suite, il a tent dn attuer ou dn annuler les effets.\nLE HARCLEMENT SEXUEL EN GNRAL Il ne fait aucun doute que le harcement sexuel est non seulement une prccupation particulie pour les femmes, mais aussi une question dnt public. Il sgit dn phome omniprent dans le milieu de travail, le gouvernement, les oles, les cabinets de droit, la profession micale, lrm, les milieux sportifs et les institutions culturelles. Le harcement, y compris le harcement sexuel, peut crr un climat de travail natif ou hostile qui peut nuire au rendement professionnel de lmploy, faire en sorte qun lui refuse un emploi, une promotion ou une occasion de formation ou me lmener quitter son emploi. Le harcement sexuel en milieu de travail est une atteinte la dignit de la victime et son respect de soi la fois comme employ et comme re humain.\nLa Cour supre du Canada a reconnu, dans Janzen c. Platy Enterprises [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, que les femmes ont droit un milieu de travail exempt dttitudes et de comportements discriminatoires et, de surcrot, qulles peuvent se praloir des vastes recours prus par la lislation sur les droits de la personne en cas de violation de ce droit. Dans lffaire Janzen (prit), deux serveuses staient plaintes dvoir fait lbjet de harcement sexuel de la part dn cuisinier travaillant dans le restaurant du dendeur. Parmi les incidents reproch figuraient des attouchements dlac et des remarques sexistes. Les plaignantes ont allu notamment qun avait menac de mettre fin leur emploi lorsqulles ont rist aux avances sexuelles. MmeJanzen a quitt son emploi apr qun des copropriaires ait refus de faire quoi que ce soit face aux allations. La Cour supre du Canada a confirm la dision de lrbitre initial qui avait conclu que les deux femmes avaient fait lbjet dn harcement sexuel persistant et abusif et qulles avaient victimes de discrimination sexuelle, ce qui allait lncontre de la lislation manitobaine sur les droits de la personne. Lrbitre a accord des dommages-ints exemplaires, indemnis la plaignante de ses pertes salariales et conclu que le cuisinier et lmployeur aient solidairement responsables de la discrimination.\nLa Cour supre a reconnu que le harcement sexuel peut prendre diverses formes et se manifester tant sur le plan physique que psychologique. Ses formes les moins graves comprennent les insinuations verbales et les marques dffection importunes. Le harcement sexuel peut cependant prendre la forme dn comportement extre comme la tentative de viol ou le viol. Physiquement, il peut sgir dtreintes, dttouchements, de frlements, de pincements ou de regards concupiscents. Psychologiquement, le harcement peut comporter des invitations des rapports physiques intimes qui prennent la forme de sous-entendus et peuvent aller jusquux demandes de rendez-vous et de faveurs sexuelles. [Voir: Janzen c. Platy Enterprises [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, par.49]\nLe juge en chef Dickson, sxprimant au nom de la Cour, a fourni une dinition non exhaustive du harcement sexuel:\nSans chercher fournir une dinition exhaustive de cette expression, jstime que le harcement sexuel en milieu de travail peut se dinir de fan gale comme ant une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit qui a un effet davorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des consuences prudiciables en matie dmploi pour les victimes du harcement. Janzen c. Platy Enterprises [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, au par.56.\nDans Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne)c. Canada (Forces arms) et Franke, [1999] A.C.F. no757 (1reinst.) (QL), [ci-apr appel Franke], la juge Tremblay-Lamer a appliqu et pris le crite Janzen (prit) servant derminer sl y a eu harcement sexuel. Dans lffaire Franke, la plaignante a allu que lmployeur, les Forces arms canadiennes, avaient exerc son endroit une discrimination, allant ainsi lncontre des articles7 et 14 de la Loi. Elle a prendu que la conduite de ses officiers supieurs crit un milieu de travail hostile et qun sous-officier supieur avait pos des questions au sujet de ses sorties, lui avait fait des gestes suggestifs et lui avait montr une carte postale reprentant une femme aux seins nus. La plaignante a alement allu que le commandant sdressait elle en des termes poratifs.\nDans une dision majoritaire (deux contre un), le Tribunal a conclu que la plaignante nvait pas subi de harcement sexuel et nvait pas fait lbjet dn traitement diffentiel cause de son sexe. La Cour fale a confirm la dision majoritaire du Tribunal, estimant que le Tribunal avait appliqu le crite appropri pour derminer sl y avait eu harcement sexuel et que ses conclusions ntaient pas manifestement daisonnables. Certains ents de preuve donnaient croire que la plaignante ne percevait pas la conduite reproch comme du harcement au moment o elle sst produite. Dans sa dision, la juge Tremblay-Lamer a donn des prisions au sujet du crite Janzen applicable dans le cas dne plainte de harcement sexuel. Deux disions rentes du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (Busheyc. Sharma, en date du 5juin2003, et Woiden et autresc. Lynn, en date du 17juin2002) rument de fan succincte les prisions de la juge Tremblay-Lamer au sujet du crite. Dans Woiden et autres, le Tribunal fournit le rum ci-apr:\nLes actes qui font lbjet de la plainte doivent avoir non sollicit. Le Tribunal doit par consuent examiner la rction dne plaignante au moment de lncident et aluer si elle a expressent ou par son comportement montr que la conduite ait non sollicit. La Cour reconnat qun refus verbal nst pas exig dans tous les cas, et lmission maintes reprises de rondre aux commentaires suggestifs signale luteur du harcement que sa conduite ait importune. La crainte de perdre son emploi, par exemple, peut inciter une employ supporter un comportement importun. La norme appropri qui doit servir aluer la conduite dne plaignante est celle dne personne raisonnable. Le comportement doit re de nature sexuelle. Cela comprend une vaste gamme de comportements. Les demandes de faveurs sexuelles et les propositions appartiennent la catorie des actes de nature sexuelle qui constituent une forme de harcement sexuel psychologique. Le harcement sexuel verbal comprend les insultes associs au sexe, les remarques sexistes, les commentaires au sujet de lpparence dne personne, de son habillement ou de ses habitudes sexuelles. Les formes de harcement sexuel physique comprennent le fait de pincer, dmpoigner, dnlacer, dmbrasser ou et de jeter des regards concupiscents. Il a did que les questions persistantes au sujet de la vie sexuelle personnelle dne employ constituent du harcement sexuel. Le Tribunal devrait derminer ce qui est de nature sexuelle en se demandant ce que ferait une personne raisonnable dans les circonstances de lspe, en conservant lsprit les normes sociales de lpoque. Habituellement, le harcement nessite un ent de persistance ou de rition, mais dans certaines circonstances, un seul incident peut re suffisamment grave pour crr un environnement hostile. La norme objective de la personne raisonnable sert aluer ce facteur galement. Le dernier facteur est envisag lorsqune plainte est dos contre un employeur au sujet du comportement de ln de ses employ. Lquit exige que, dans de tels cas, la victime du harcement, dans la mesure du possible, informe lmployeur du prum comportement offensant. Ce facteur nst gue pertinent en lccurrence, compte tenu du rlement que les plaignantes ont conclu avec lmployeur avant que lffaire soit renvoy au prent Tribunal. [au par.103]\nEn ce qui concerne le crite de la personne raisonnable, la Cour dppel fale a statu que, dans les cas de harcement sexuel o la prum victime est une femme, ce crite doit re adapt en consuence (Stadnykc. Canada (Commission de lmploi et de lmmigration) (2000), 38 C.H.R.R. 01290, au par.25 (C.A.F.)). Dans Franke (prit), la juge Tremblay-Lamer prise que, pour derminer comment une personne raisonnable rgirait dans des circonstances similaires, le Tribunal devrait re conscient des normes sttyps au sujet de ce qui constitue une conduite sociale acceptable et tenir compte du contexte de la conduite reproch lorsqul dermine la fan dont la personne raisonnable rgirait dans des circonstances similaires. [Franke, C.F., 1reinst., prit, au par.41]\nDans Swanc. Canada (Forces arms), (1994) 25 C.H.R.R. 0\/312 (Trib. can.), au par.73, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a confirm quil nst pas nessaire que le harcement soit la seule raison qui motive les actes donc par le plaignant pour que ce dernier obtienne gain de cause. Il nst pas non plus nessaire que le harcement ait intentionnel de la part de son auteur. En lccurrence, le plaignant ait un canadien drigine autochtone. Il alluait avoir fait lbjet dnsinuations, de farces et de harcement racistes alors qul faisait partie des Forces arms canadiennes.\nLe Tribunal a clairement pris que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne prend pas en considation la conduite du plaignant, et me si les plaignants ont particip au comportement rrensible ou lnt provoqu, ils peuvent toujours doser une plainte et obtenir gain de cause . (Swanc. Forces arms canadienne, dision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne en date du 18octobre1994, la p.8). Cet onc est conforme lbjet rarateur de Loi. Dans Swan, le Tribunal a admis que des personnes peuvent se sentir incapables de faire autrement que dccepter le comportement en raison de leur dir de sntrer leurs pairs. Jugeant la plainte fond, le Tribunal a ordonn de prenter au plaignant une lettre dxcuses tout en prisant qul ntait pas habilit lndemniser de ses pertes salariales. Toutefois, le Tribunal a pris que, sl avait ce pouvoir, il lurait indemnis de ses pertes salariales correspondant la piode restante de son contrat dmploi jusqu concurrence de quatre ans, dans la mesure o la dur de ladite piode aurait du moins quatre ans au moment de sa libation. Le plaignant avait demand une indemnit salariale portant sur une piode de quatre anns. Le Tribunal a alement fait remarquer que si le plaignant ait rendu au terme de son contrat dmploi, il nccorderait pas dndemnit salariale. Pour trancher cette question, le Tribunal sst demand juste titre si le harcement dont le plaignant avait fait lbjet avait jou dans sa dision de quitter les FAC. En outre, il a fait observer qul ntait pas nessaire que le harcement soit le seul ent ayant contribu la dision de quitter. [Swan, dision du Tribunal, la p.15].\nLa Commission et le plaignant ont dos une demande de contrle judiciaire portant exclusivement sur le refus dccorder une indemnit pour les pertes salariales. La Section de premie instance de la Cour fale a accueilli la demande. Par consuent, une victime de harcement aux termes de lrticle 14 de la Loi peut re indemnis, en totalit ou en partie, des pertes salariales qulle a subies en raison des actes discriminatoires.\nLa Loi et la jurisprudence prisent clairement qun employeur est responsable de tous les actes discriminatoires commis par ses employ dans le cadre de leur emploi. Le paragraphe65(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne disculpe lmployeur si lcte a eu lieu sans son consentement, sl a pris toutes les mesures nessaires pour lmpher et que, par la suite, il a tent dn attuer ou dn annuler les effets.\nDans Robichaudc. La Reine, la Cour supre du Canada a fait remarquer que [TRADUCTION] lxistence dne politique contre le harcement sexuel et dn manisme de rlement des plaintes des employ pouvait constituer pour lmployeur un bon moyen de dense et attuer partiellement la responsabilit. La Cour a pris ce qui suit:\n[Lemployeur qui, devant une plainte, rgit promptement et efficacement en ablissant un plan destin remier la situation et empher qulle ne se reproduise ne sera pas responsable dans la me mesure, si jamais il lst vraiment, qun employeur qui ndopte pas de telles mesures. Ces questions concernent cependant les consuences en matie de redressement et non pas la responsabilit. [ la p.12]\nFaisant rence lrr Robichaud, Aggarwal et Gupta indiquent que la Cour supre informe les employeurs que ce sont leurs faits et gestes, et non leurs paroles, qui sont les ents cl examiner lorsqul sgit de derminer leur responsabilit dans les affaires de harcement sexuel. [Aggarwal, 2000, la p.264.]\nSelon le Black Law Dictionary, la diligence raisonnable se dinit comme:\n[TRADUCTION] Le degr de prudence, dctivit et dttention auquel on peut bon droit sttendre de la part dne personne raisonnable et prudente et dont fait habituellement preuve cette personne raisonnable et prudente face une situation donn; ne fait lbjet ducune norme absolue, mais dend des faits propres chaque cas.\nDans l'exercice de toute la diligence raisonnable n\u00e9cessaire pour emp\u00eacher de commettre des actes de harc\u00e8lement ou pour att\u00e9nuer ou contrer leurs effets, l'employeur doit a)priser clairement que le harcement, quelle qun soit la forme, y compris le harcement sexuel, ne saurait re tol; b)ablir une politique contre le harcement qui indique clairement et de fan non uivoque tous les employ que le harcement sexuel est inacceptable et va lncontre de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne; c)sssurer que chaque employ comprend la politique et les procures destins prenir le harcement ainsi que la procure de rlement des plaintes de harcement sexuel; d)informer les surveillants et les cadres de leur responsabilit dffrir un milieu de travail exempt de harcement; e)faire enque promptement et efficacement sur les allations de harcement et apporter les correctifs voulus, et ce, me sl n a pas eu de plainte en bonne et due forme. daut de prendre sans tarder les mesures correctives voulues, lmployeur sxpose re jug pleinement responsable du harcement sexuel.\nEn ce qui concerne les manismes de rapport et dnque sur les plaintes, une bonne politique contre le harcement proit pour les plaintes de multiples points de chute aux divers niveaux de lrganisation. Une telle politique permet un employ de recourir au point de chute qui lui convient le mieux, compte tenu de sa situation. Une bonne politique contre le harcement assure que toutes les plaintes seront prises au sieux et traits promptement et uitablement. En outre, une bonne politique contre le harcement renforce le principe selon lequel les personnes qui seront trouvs responsables de harcement sexuel feront lbjet de mesures disciplinaires. Aggarwal propose la mhode dnalyse drite ci-apr pour derminer la gravit de la sanction imposer un employ trouv responsable de harcement sexuel:\n[TRADUCTION] Les mesures disciplinaires vont des rrimandes et avertissements verbaux, pour les infractions les plus les, jusqu la suspension sans solde ou au congiement, pour les infractions les plus graves. Si lmployeur dide qune mutation smpose, il devrait muter luteur du harcement plutt que la victime. Cependant, avant de dider de la mesure disciplinaire appropri, lmployeur devrait tenir compte de divers facteurs: la nature de la conduite, la persistance de celle-ci, le dir de luteur du harcement de collaborer et de smender, etc.[Aggarwal, Arjun et Madhu Gupta, Sexual Harassment in the Workplace, 3e.(Markham (Ontario): Butterworths Canada Ltd.: 2000, la p.457)\nDans Gervaisc. Canada (Agriculture Canada), [1988] D.C.D.P. no8 (Tribunal dppel des droits de la personne) (QL), un tribunal dppel des droits de la personne, se fondant sur lrr Robichaud (prit), a conclu que lmployeur, Agriculture Canada, ait responsable des actes de harcement sexuel commis par un de ses employ. En lccurrence, la plaignante alluait que son milieu de travail portait atteinte la dignit des femmes. Des toignages prent ludience ont r que des revues aient laisss dans des tiroirs de pupitres et que les murs aient orn dffiches choquantes et de mauvais got. Bien qul se soit inqui de lllation de la plaignante selon laquelle le climat de travail ait empoisonn, le tribunal dppel sst dit convaincu qul y avait bel et bien eu harcement sexuel et que lrticle7 de la Loi avait enfreint. Sur la foi de lrrr Robichud, il a conclu que lmployeur, Agriculture Canada, ait responsable de la conduite de son employ. Le tribunal, dans le cadre de son examen de la conduite de lmployeur par rapport lttuation des dommages, a formul les remarques importantes qui suivent:\nBien qul y ait eu une enque approfondie et exhaustive de cet incident, par les reprentants syndicaux, par les autorit policies et par les enqueurs sous la direction de J.J.Cartier, la dision finale est de ne pendre aucune mesure. [...] Les griefs de lppelante [plaignante] ont nessit un long et laborieux examen un moment o elle ait sous lffet dn stress physique et otif tr fort et se faisait suivre par un mecin. La demande de mutation fut le comble de lberration bureaucratique. Nous convenons avec le tribunal de premie instance qul est difficilement concevable que le ministe ait pris toute mesure raisonnable pour faciliter cette mutation. [Gervais (prit)]\nLe tribunal dppel a conclu que les mesures prises par Agriculture Canada la suite des actes qui constituaient le harcement sexuel aient inefficaces et peu concluantes et il a maintenu que lmployeur ait responsable des pertes salariales et du prudice moral subis par la plaignante.\nLa jurisprudence prise clairement que lmployeur, pour iter dtre trouv responsable, doit rgir promptement et efficacement et mener une enque pertinente et approfondie sur lbjet de la plainte tout en traitant la plaignante avec beaucoup dgards. (Voir Swan (prit) la p.14; Hindsc. Canada (C.E.I.C.) (1988),24 C.E.I.C. 65; Pitawanakwatc. Secrariat dtat (1992),19 C.H.R.R. C\/10 (port en appel pour dutres motifs)).\nEn conclusion, il est important de priser que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne renferme aucune disposition permettant dllouer les dens un intim la suite dne dense rssie. Conforment au paragraphe53(1), le Tribunal rejette la plainte sl estime qulle nst pas fond. Cependant, dans le cas contraire, le paragraphe53(2) confe au Tribunal le pouvoir dccorder divers redressements (rntration dans lmploi, indemnit pour pertes salariales, attribution des frais engag, indemnit pour prudice moral, indemnit spiale, etc.). La jurisprudence rente du Tribunal re que ce dernier a accord les frais juridiques engag par les plaignantes qui ont eu gain de cause.",

Hill. On m'a fait faire une visite des lieux o\u00f9 sont survenus la plupart des \u00e9v\u00e9nements pertinents. J'\u00e9tais accompagn\u00e9 du plaignant et des avocats des diverses parties. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu'on s'est interrog\u00e9 sur les incidences de la visite des lieux au cours de l'audience, il m'appara\u00eet pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de clarifier la situation.\n[2] Le droit n'est pas clair au sujet des visites de lieux. Dans leur ouvrage intitul\u00e9 Law of Evidence in Canada, le juge Sopinka et ses coauteurs s'interrogent [TRADUCTION] \u00e0 savoir si une visite des lieux constitue une preuve \u00e0 partir de laquelle le juge des faits peut tirer des conclusions ou simplement un moyen de clarifier le t\u00e9moignage du t\u00e9moin (1). Le Tribunal n'a pas trait\u00e9 express\u00e9ment de cette question. Cependant, dans l'affaire Bye c. Syndicat international des d\u00e9bardeurs et magasiniers, Section locale 502, T.C.D.P. T391\/0794, le Tribunal a n\u00e9anmoins fait une visite au bureau d'embauchage syndical afin de voir les tableaux d'affichage des offres d'emploi avant l'audition des t\u00e9moignages. Il a sembl\u00e9 consid\u00e9rer cette visite comme une source de preuve originale \u00e0 laquelle il pourrait se reporter durant le reste de la pr\u00e9sentation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[3] Les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal vont \u00e0 l'encontre de la th\u00e9orie voulant qu'une visite des lieux n'ait pas valeur de preuve. Ce constat est \u00e9vident dans l'affaire Forseille c. United Grain Growers Ltd., [1985] T.C.D.P. 7, o\u00f9 le Tribunal s'est fond\u00e9 sur ce qu'il avait observ\u00e9 durant la visite des lieux comme preuve tout en s'abstenant d'aborder la question de droit en cause. Il y a \u00e9galement eu des visites de lieux dans les affaires Gauthier c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes) (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. 6014 et Martin c. Canada (D\u00e9fense nationale) [1992] 17 C.H.R.R. 435 (T.C.D.P.), o\u00f9 les situations \u00e9taient similaires. Il est n\u00e9anmoins possible qu'une visite des lieux constitue une preuve directe au vrai sens du terme, du fait qu'elle n'est pas filtr\u00e9e \u00e0 travers les sens d'un t\u00e9moin. Par cons\u00e9quent, une telle preuve est souvent plus contraignante qu'un t\u00e9moignage, lequel constitue toujours une preuve d\u00e9riv\u00e9e.\n[4] L'arr\u00eat-cl\u00e9 de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale semble \u00eatre Jaworski c. (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) [1998], 4 C.F. 154 (C.F., 1re inst.). Dans cette affaire, le comit\u00e9 d'arbitrage s'est rendu sur les lieux o\u00f9 le demandeur s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment exhib\u00e9 (2). Le demandeur a ni\u00e9 l'all\u00e9gation et donn\u00e9 une autre explication de sa pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 cet endroit. Il a dit qu'il \u00e9tait assis sur le porche arri\u00e8re lorsqu'il a vu un homme regarder sa voiture. Il a cri\u00e9 \u00e0 l'homme et s'est rendu dans la ruelle, o\u00f9 les policiers qui menaient l'enqu\u00eate l'ont abord\u00e9. Bien qu'il ait donn\u00e9 au demandeur la possibilit\u00e9 d'ajouter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments au dossier au sujet de la visite des lieux, le comit\u00e9 d'arbitrage n'a exprim\u00e9 aucune r\u00e9serve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des observations faites durant cette visite.\n[5] Le comit\u00e9 d'arbitrage a soutenu par la suite que le demandeur n'avait pu voir l'\u00e9tranger suffisamment bien pour \u00eatre en mesure de le d\u00e9crire comme il l'avait fait dans son t\u00e9moignage. C'est l'un des facteurs qui l'ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 rejeter le t\u00e9moignage du demandeur. La d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9 d'arbitrage a \u00e9ventuellement \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 l'attention du commissaire de la GRC par un comit\u00e9 d'examen externe. Le commissaire a rejet\u00e9 l'appel du demandeur. L'affaire a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, o\u00f9 l'on a soulev\u00e9 deux questions relativement \u00e0 la visite des lieux. D'abord, on s'est demand\u00e9 si le juge des faits peut se fonder sur une visite des lieux pour rejeter le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins. Ce faisant, on traiterait essentiellement la visite des lieux comme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, situation qui rev\u00eat en soi un caract\u00e8re probant. Ensuite, on s'est demand\u00e9 si le comit\u00e9 d'arbitrage \u00e9tait tenu de faire part aux parties de ses r\u00e9serves.\n[6] En ce qui touche la premi\u00e8re question, le juge Rothstein a examin\u00e9 deux positions contradictoires. La premi\u00e8re d\u00e9coule du jugement rendu par la Cour d'appel de l'Angleterre dans l'affaire London General Omnibus Company v. Lavell, [1901] 1 Ch. 135, o\u00f9 lord Alverstone a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 (p. 139) :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00c0 mon avis, cet examen vise \u00e0 permettre au Tribunal de comprendre les questions soulev\u00e9es, de faire le suivi de la preuve et de l'interpr\u00e9ter.\nLes cours de l'Ontario ont apparemment abond\u00e9 dans ce sens, soutenant qu'on peut faire une visite des lieux pour comprendre la preuve mais qu'une telle visite ne constitue pas en soi une preuve.\n[7] En ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me position, je ne crois pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9 de pr\u00e9tendre qu'elle traite la distinction faite dans London Omnibus comme de l'ergotage : une preuve est une preuve et, du moins dans la plupart des cas, il est factice, voire fallacieux, de pr\u00e9tendre qu'elle n'a pas d'effet probant. Par cons\u00e9quent, un juge est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 se fonder sur les observations faites au cours d'une visite des lieux pour rejeter les all\u00e9gations de fait des t\u00e9moins. Cette position d\u00e9coule des jugements Meyers v. Government of Manitoba & Dobrowski, (1960), 26 D.L.R. (2d) 550 C.A. Man.) et Calgary & Edmonton Railway Co. v. MacKinnon (1910) 43 R.C.S. 379. On la retrouve \u00e9galement en droit anglais.\n[8] Les pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es dans la jurisprudence d\u00e9coulent de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de s\u00e9parer les r\u00f4les lors d'une audience. Il est difficile pour le juge des faits de tenir compte de ses propres observations lorsqu'il r\u00e9unit les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sans empi\u00e9ter sur le domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux parties. Dans la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans l'affaire Technologie Labtronix c. Technologie Micro-contr\u00f4le, R.E.J.B. 1998-07742, par exemple, on soutient qu'un juge ne devrait pas se servir d'une visite des lieux \u00e0 des fins d'enqu\u00eate. Il n'appartient pas au juge des faits de recueillir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. En outre, on s'inqui\u00e8te \u00e9galement de la possibilit\u00e9 que le juge des faits assume dans un tel cas le r\u00f4le d'un t\u00e9moin, dont le t\u00e9moignage silencieux ne peut \u00eatre contr\u00e9 par les parties. Cela soul\u00e8ve un probl\u00e8me de justice naturelle.\n[9] Il existe une troisi\u00e8me position. Dans Jaworski, le juge Rothstein semble admettre le principe fondamental voulant que le but d'une visite des lieux soit de mieux comprendre la preuve. Il rejette n\u00e9anmoins l'id\u00e9e que la visite n'a pas en soi de valeur probante :\n\u2026 \u00e0 mon avis, cela ne signifie pas n\u00e9cessairement que, lorsqu'un tribunal proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une visite des lieux non pas dans le but de recueillir ses propres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, mais afin de mieux comprendre la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il ne peut en aucun cas se fonder sur ses propres observations faites au cours de la visite. Lorsqu'un tribunal observe un \u00e9l\u00e9ment incompatible avec la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les parties, il serait irr\u00e9aliste d'exiger qu'il ignore ses observations et tranche la question sur la foi d'une preuve qu'il juge fausse.\nIl s'ensuit qu'une visite des lieux constitue une preuve, quoique de nature explicative, dont on peut tenir compte en plus des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Il semblerait donc que la question qui importe est celle de savoir si les parties ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9agir \u00e0 tout point soulev\u00e9 en rapport avec cette id\u00e9e.\n[10] La deuxi\u00e8me question qui s'est pos\u00e9e dans Jaworski \u00e9tait la suivante : le comit\u00e9 d'arbitrage \u00e9tait-il tenu de faire part de ses pr\u00e9occupations aux parties? Le juge Rothstein a rejet\u00e9 cette id\u00e9e, soutenant que le demandeur avait eu pleinement l'occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux observations faites durant la visite. Toutefois, je crois que cette opinion se limite aux faits relatifs \u00e0 cette affaire. La situation peut \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente dans d'autres cas. On peut en arriver \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 le tribunal doit, par souci d'\u00e9quit\u00e9, divulguer ses pr\u00e9occupations aux parties. Tout d\u00e9pend des circonstances propres \u00e0 l'affaire. Je ne vois pas comment un tribunal peut respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et, somme toute, dissimuler aux parties des points d\u00e9cisifs.\n[11] L'arr\u00eat Jaworski \u00e9tablit n\u00e9anmoins qu'un tribunal n'est pas tenu de soulever des \u00e9l\u00e9ments factuels qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s au grand jour et dont les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment saisies. Le facteur crucial \u00e0 la fin de l'audience consiste \u00e0 se demander si les parties ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re, pour reprendre les termes employ\u00e9s dans la Loi, de r\u00e9agir aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments substantiels pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Si les parties d\u00e9cident de ne pas aborder des questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9es au Tribunal, c'est leur droit et elles ne peuvent se plaindre d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prises par surprise. Je crois qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 de la v\u00e9ritable conclusion dans l'arr\u00eat Jaworski, qui semble donner \u00e0 un tribunal une certaine latitude quant \u00e0 l'opportunit\u00e9 de tenir compte des observations faites \u00e0 l'occasion d'une visite.\n[12] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la visite des lieux a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite relativement t\u00f4t au cours de l'audience, afin que je puisse mieux comprendre le reste de la preuve qui serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Toutes les parties ont approuv\u00e9 la d\u00e9marche et ont eu amplement l'occasion de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour contester ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9. La difficult\u00e9 qui pourrait se poser, c'est que nous avons fait cette visite plusieurs ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements se soient produits. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ai fait montre de circonspection \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des observations que j'ai faites lors de ma visite de l'atelier. Toutefois, je ne crois pas que cette visite ait soulev\u00e9 des questions dont les parties n'avaient pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 saisies.\n[13] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ai conclu que je puis me reporter aux observations faites au cours de la visite, ainsi qu'au reste de la preuve, pour trancher le litige principal en l'esp\u00e8ce. Je ne crois pas que cette question m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre comment\u00e9e davantage.\nOriginale sign\u00e9e par\nPaul Groarke\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 5 f\u00e9vrier 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDU DOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL No : T677\/6501\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Yul F.

INTRODUCTION [1] En d\u00e9cembre 2001, Melanie-Lynn McKay a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne contre la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC). Dans sa plainte, elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la GRC avait refus\u00e9 de l'employer en raison de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de toxicomanie, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Ronald Howell a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte contre les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (FAC) en juillet 1998. Dans sa plainte, il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les FAC avaient exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination en exigeant qu'il prenne part \u00e0 un exercice sans support de genou, allant ainsi \u00e0 l'encontre de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a renvoy\u00e9 les deux plaintes au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pour instruction. L'audience dans l'affaire Howell est pr\u00e9vue en f\u00e9vrier 2004. Celle dans l'affaire McKay doit avoir lieu en avril 2004. Les deux intim\u00e9es sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par le minist\u00e8re de la Justice \u00e0 Winnipeg. Dans chaque cas, la Commission a inform\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part les autres parties que sa participation \u00e0 l'audience se limiterait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation d'un expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire. Les intim\u00e9es ont par la suite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des requ\u00eates afin de faire opposition \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission entend participer \u00e0 ces instances.\n[3] La Commission a ult\u00e9rieurement inform\u00e9 les parties qu'elle participerait pleinement \u00e0 chaque audience. Cependant, les intim\u00e9es cherchent encore \u00e0 obtenir du Tribunal une ordonnance sur les requ\u00eates. Leur position est simple. Ayant renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son intention de jouer un r\u00f4le restreint dans ces instances, la Commission a tacitement reconnu que son approche initiale \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9e. Les intim\u00e9es sont d'avis, par cons\u00e9quent, qu'ils ont droit \u00e0 une ordonnance \u00e0 cet effet.\n[4] La Commission s'oppose \u00e0 la demande des intim\u00e9es, affirmant que les questions soulev\u00e9es dans leurs requ\u00eates sont sans objet puisque la Commission participera pleinement aux audiences. En outre, la Commission affirme que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour trancher les requ\u00eates. Comme les questions \u00e0 examiner dans les deux instances sont identiques, les requ\u00eates ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues ensemble.\nII. HISTORIQUE DES FAITS [5] Le 15 mai 2003, les affaires McKay et Howell ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal pour instruction. Environ deux semaines plus tard, Me Ian Fine, l'avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim de la Commission, a transmis aux parties l'avis suivant :\n[TRADUCTION] L'avocat de la Commission compara\u00eetra \u00e0 l'audience afin d'y pr\u00e9senter un expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire pr\u00e9cisant les motifs d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans cet expos\u00e9, la Commission fournira son opinion sur les questions de droit et de fait en cause, ainsi qu'une description d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de l'\u00e9tat du droit par rapport \u00e0 votre plainte. L'avocat de la Commission ne sera pas pr\u00e9sent durant toute la dur\u00e9e de l'audience.\n[6] Ces lettres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies d'un \u00e9change de correspondance entre les parties, les avocats des intim\u00e9es cherchant \u00e0 obtenir des \u00e9claircissements \u00e0 propos de la teneur des expos\u00e9s pr\u00e9liminaires.\n[7] Les avocats des intim\u00e9es se sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont la Commission entendait proc\u00e9der. Les intim\u00e9es ont fait valoir que la Commission devrait participer pleinement \u00e0 chacune des audiences, car la Loi selon elles l'y oblige, ou renoncer compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 y prendre part. Ils soutiennent qu'il leur serait pr\u00e9judiciable de permettre \u00e0 la Commission de pr\u00e9senter un expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire si elle n'a pas l'intention de produire une preuve.\n[8] Le 26 septembre 2003, Ceilidh Snider, de la Commission, a \u00e9crit aux parties en cause dans chaque instance. En ce qui concerne l'affaire McKay, elle a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION] Je vous prie de noter que la Commission participera pleinement \u00e0 l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce. Nous aurions gr\u00e9 au Tribunal de bien vouloir communiquer avec la Commission et les parties pour fixer les dates de divulgation et d'audience.\n[9] Dans l'affaire Howell, le ton emprunt\u00e9 par Mme Snider est encore plus laconique. La lettre, dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, se lit comme suit :\n[TRADUCTION] Je vous prie de noter que la Commission participera pleinement \u00e0 l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[10] La Commission n'a fourni ni dans l'affaire McKay ni dans l'affaire Howell aucune explication quant \u00e0 sa volte-face \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa participation \u00e0 l'audience.\n[11] La situation n'a pas chang\u00e9. La Commission n'a fait \u00e9tat dans l'un et l'autre cas d'aucun changement d'opinion \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des questions en cause qui pourrait expliquer sa volte-face. Toutefois, l'avocat de la Commission a candidement reconnu durant son argumentation que la CCDP a chang\u00e9 son fusil d'\u00e9paule pour \u00e9viter de d\u00e9battre les faits et le droit relatifs aux objections soulev\u00e9es par les intim\u00e9es.\nIII. QUESTIONA PR\u00c9JUDICIELLE [12] La Commission pr\u00e9tend que sa comparution aux audiences est un droit inconditionnel. Elle affirme que les intim\u00e9es demandent maintenant au Tribunal d'examiner la fa\u00e7on dont elle a choisi de repr\u00e9senter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, pr\u00e9cisant que cette question d\u00e9borde la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal et ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9e que par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[13] Nous reconnaissons que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de participer ou non \u00e0 une instance peut l\u00e9gitimement faire l'objet d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et non pas de ce Tribunal. Il appartient \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9terminer la meilleure fa\u00e7on de s'acquitter du mandat de repr\u00e9sentation de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public que lui conf\u00e8re l'article 51 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cela ne signifie pas pour autant que la comparution de la Commission devant le Tribunal n'est soumise \u00e0 aucune contrainte ou que la CCDP n'a pas \u00e0 se soucier des r\u00e8gles d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et des droits des autres parties \u00e0 l'instance.\n[14] Le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre du processus d'audience et a le pouvoir de prendre des mesures lorsque la conduite d'une partie aurait pour effet de causer une injustice \u00e0 une autre partie. En tant qu'organisme juridictionnel qui se prononce sur des droits quasi constitutionnels, le Tribunal a le pouvoir et le devoir d'assurer l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. Ainsi, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'emp\u00eacher la Commission de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ne sont pas pertinents ou des conclusions finales portant sur des faits non pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve. Le Tribunal a aussi le pouvoir de veiller \u00e0 ce que les expos\u00e9s pr\u00e9liminaires de la Commission soient conformes aux principes fondamentaux de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9.\nIV. ANALYSE [15] La Commission soutient que les questions soulev\u00e9es par les intim\u00e9es dans les affaires Howell et McKay sont maintenant sans objet, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de participer pleinement \u00e0 l'audience. La Commission pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal devrait, par cons\u00e9quent, refuser d'entendre les requ\u00eates des intim\u00e9es.\n[16] De l'avis des intim\u00e9es, la doctrine du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique ne s'applique pas aux questions de pratique, sur lesquelles le Tribunal a pleine discr\u00e9tion. Selon les intim\u00e9es, m\u00eame s'il devait conclure que les requ\u00eates sont maintenant sans objet, le Tribunal devrait les trancher. Les intim\u00e9es estiment que les requ\u00eates soul\u00e8vent d'importantes questions touchant la pratique devant le Tribunal. Toutes les parties qui comparaissent devant le Tribunal b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieraient de l'orientation du Tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[17] Toutefois, les avocats des intim\u00e9es vont plus loin et font valoir que la Commission fait des manuvres d'\u00e9vitement dans ces affaires. La Commission ne devrait pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 escamoter une question soulev\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9es sans reconna\u00eetre formellement qu'elle est tenue de participer pleinement aux audiences. Le Tribunal ne devrait pas fermer les yeux sur les tactiques de la Commission dans ces instances et devrait trancher les requ\u00eates.\n[18] La Commission a admis que les questions d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public que soul\u00e8vent les affaires Howell et McKay sont demeur\u00e9es les m\u00eames depuis sa d\u00e9cision initiale et le moment o\u00f9 elle a renvers\u00e9 cette m\u00eame d\u00e9cision. Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, l'avocat de la Commission a candidement reconnu que la Commission s'est ravis\u00e9e afin d'\u00e9viter de d\u00e9battre les faits et le droit relatifs aux objections soulev\u00e9es par les intim\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la nouvelle approche de la Commission vis-\u00e0-vis de sa participation aux audiences du Tribunal. \u00c0 notre avis, cette fa\u00e7on d'agir soul\u00e8ve de s\u00e9rieuses pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission exerce son mandat de repr\u00e9sentation de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Elle donne l'impression que les faits et gestes de la Commission \u00e9taient dict\u00e9s par des motifs opportunistes plut\u00f4t que par les questions de fond que soul\u00e8vent les affaires Howell et McKay.\n[19] Les intim\u00e9es ont exprim\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des frais qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contraints d'engager du fait qu'ils ont d\u00fb pr\u00e9senter des requ\u00eates qui se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es inutiles au bout du compte. Ce sont l\u00e0 des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes. Dans une affaire au civil, le Tribunal indemniserait de ses frais la partie requ\u00e9rante si la partie adverse devait se d\u00e9rober devant une requ\u00eate en instance. \u00c0 notre avis, il y aurait eu lieu en l'esp\u00e8ce d'adjuger des frais aux intim\u00e9es. Toutefois, il n'y a rien que le Tribunal puisse faire pour leur accorder un tel redressement.\n[20] Nous avons examin\u00e9 les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents cit\u00e9s par les parties relativement \u00e0 la question du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique et aux consid\u00e9rations de principe susceptibles d'amener un organisme juridictionnel \u00e0 se prononcer sur une question qui autrement serait peut-\u00eatre devenue sans objet. Ayant examin\u00e9 les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents en question, nous avons conclu qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le Tribunal exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et statue sur les requ\u00eates des intim\u00e9es.\n[21] Il ne fait aucun doute que les requ\u00eates soul\u00e8vent une question qui est d'une importance fondamentale du point de vue de la pratique devant le Tribunal, \u00e0 savoir le caract\u00e8re \u00e9quitable ou opportun de la nouvelle approche adopt\u00e9e par la Commission \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de beaucoup de plaintes dont le Tribunal est saisi. Cependant, la semaine o\u00f9 notre formation coll\u00e9giale a entendu les requ\u00eates dans les affaires Howell et McKay, les m\u00eames questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battues vigoureusement dans deux autres affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi. \u00c0 notre avis, la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Mowat c.

Grant Sinclair\n[TRADUCTION]\nI. INTRODUCTION\nII. FAITS\nINTRODUCTION [1] Maurice Bressette est le plaignant dans cette affaire. Il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en date du 30 mars 2002 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Dans sa plainte, il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9, le Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle Point et de Stony Point, avait exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination en ne l'embauchant pas \u00e0 titre de travailleur en service social familial au sein de son D\u00e9partement des services \u00e0 l'enfance, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le motif de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est la situation de famille.\nFAITS [2] Le Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle Point et de Stony Point est un conseil de bande qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au paragraphe 2(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 74 de cette m\u00eame loi. Le plaignant, Maurice Bressette, est un Indien inscrit qui est membre de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle Point et de Stony Point.\n[3] En ao\u00fbt 2001, le Conseil de bande a mis sur pied un comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection afin de mener des entrevues pour le poste de travailleur\/travailleuse en service social familial au D\u00e9partement des services \u00e0 l'enfance. Il s'agit d'un poste pr\u00e9vu au budget qui est pleinement financ\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re des Services sociaux et communautaires de l'Ontario en vertu d'une m\u00e9thode de financement pr\u00e9\u00e9tablie. Le D\u00e9partement des services \u00e0 l'enfance intervient aupr\u00e8s des enfants et des familles de la bande qui \u00e9prouvent des difficult\u00e9s.\n[4] Ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9es un certain nombre de personnes, dont le plaignant, Deb Herman, Dorothy French, Heather Bressette et Georgina Bressette. Le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection a recommand\u00e9 Deb Herman pour le poste ainsi que Dorothy French comme substitut. Dorothy French ayant mis en doute les comp\u00e9tences de Deb Herman pour le poste, le Conseil de bande s'est abstenu de pourvoir celui-ci, mais a renvoy\u00e9 la question au Comit\u00e9 des finances et du personnel.\n[5] Lorraine George, qui agissait comme pr\u00e9sidente de ce comit\u00e9 en 2001, a comparu \u00e0 l'audience portant sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que la bande accusait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque un d\u00e9ficit de l'ordre de 800 000 $ \u00e0 1 000 000 $. Le Conseil de bande avait donn\u00e9 au comit\u00e9 le mandat de trouver des moyens d'enrayer ce d\u00e9ficit. Le comit\u00e9 a produit deux documents traitant du probl\u00e8me. Le premier portait sur la strat\u00e9gie pour rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9ficit tandis que le deuxi\u00e8me consistait en un plan d'activit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de finances et de personnel.\n[6] Quelque temps avant la r\u00e9union du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2002 du Conseil de bande, Stan Sabourin, l'administrateur de la bande, qui connaissait \u00e0 la fois les besoins de dotation et les besoins financiers, a eu des entretiens avec Mme George au sujet du remaniement de certaines t\u00e2ches en vue de r\u00e9aliser des \u00e9conomies. Il a recommand\u00e9 d'attribuer \u00e0 Eva Bressette, qui agissait \u00e0 temps plein comme repr\u00e9sentante de la bande, le poste de travailleur\/travailleuse en service social familial, et que ce soit fait par voie de mutation interne.\n[7] M. Sabourin a \u00e9galement recommand\u00e9 de confier les fonctions de repr\u00e9sentant de la bande \u00e0 l'avocat qui \u00e9tait au service de cette derni\u00e8re, \u00e9liminant ainsi le poste de repr\u00e9sentant de la bande comme tel. Le repr\u00e9sentant de la bande est charg\u00e9 de repr\u00e9senter les enfants de la bande lors des audiences portant sur des questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la protection des enfants.\n[8] La bande obtient son financement dans le cadre de diverses ententes financi\u00e8res conclues avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Le compte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la bande est financ\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des ententes de contribution EFCPN, en vertu desquelles la bande re\u00e7oit un financement de base et un financement compl\u00e9mentaire. Le financement de base sert \u00e0 financer les d\u00e9penses g\u00e9n\u00e9rales tandis que le financement compl\u00e9mentaire est li\u00e9 \u00e0 des programmes particuliers auquel il doit \u00eatre consacr\u00e9 en exclusivit\u00e9.\n[9] Le repr\u00e9sentant de la bande est un poste vis\u00e9 par le financement compl\u00e9mentaire, qui fait l'objet d'un examen annuel et est fond\u00e9 sur le nombre de cas de l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Le nombre de cas ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 insuffisant pour financer le salaire \u00e0 temps plein d'Eva Bressette, le solde est puis\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame le compte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la bande. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que ses fonctions de repr\u00e9sentante de la bande ne l'occupaient pas \u00e0 temps plein, Eva Bressette remplissait certaines des fonctions de travailleur en service social familial au sein du D\u00e9partement des services \u00e0 l'enfance.\nPROC\u00c8S-VERBAUX DES R\u00c9UNIONS DU CONSEIL DE BANDE ET DU COMIT\u00c9 DES FINANCES ET DU PERSONNEL [10] Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la r\u00e9union du mercredi 6 f\u00e9vrier 2002 du Comit\u00e9 des finances et du personnel indique que le comit\u00e9 a approuv\u00e9 la recommandation de M. Sabourin concernant la mutation interne d'Eva Bressette pour des raisons financi\u00e8res et professionnelles. En outre, Eva Bressette a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de mutation.\n[11] Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la r\u00e9union du jeudi 21 mars 2002 du Conseil de bande indique que la recommandation de muter Eva Bressette au poste de travailleur\/travailleuse en service social familial a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e. Il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e9galement dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal que l'avocat au service de la bande assumerait les fonctions de repr\u00e9sentant de la bande. Ce proc\u00e8s-verbal ne fait aucunement mention d'avantages financiers d\u00e9coulant de cette d\u00e9cision. Par suite de cette d\u00e9cision, il n'y avait plus trois postes mais bien deux, dont l'un est enti\u00e8rement financ\u00e9 par la province.\nARGUMENTATION DE L'INTIM\u00c9 \u00c0 L'APPUI DE LA REQU\u00caTE [12] L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte de M. Bressette en raison de l'article 67 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cet article pr\u00e9cise que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est sans effet sur la Loi sur les Indiens et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette derni\u00e8re. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9cision de pourvoir le poste de travailleur\/travailleuse en service social familial et de transf\u00e9rer les responsabilit\u00e9s du repr\u00e9sentant de la bande \u00e0 l'avocat au service de cette derni\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens et ne peut, par cons\u00e9quent, faire l'objet d'un examen de ce Tribunal. \u00c0 l'appui de cette pr\u00e9tention, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande \u00e9tait une d\u00e9cision financi\u00e8re comportant un aspect de dotation accessoire. La bande accusait un important d\u00e9ficit et ce remaniement au sein du personnel a permis d'\u00e9conomiser un peu d'argent.\na) Argumentation juridique [13] L'intim\u00e9 a cit\u00e9 quatre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents portant sur l'article 67 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Ces pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9partis en deux cat\u00e9gories : les cas o\u00f9 le tribunal n'avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte et ceux o\u00f9 sa comp\u00e9tence a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e.\n[14] Le premier cas dans la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie est l'affaire Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), [1995] 3 C.N.L.R. 28 (C.F., 1re inst.). Cette affaire portait sur l'article 115 de la Loi sur les Indiens, qui conf\u00e8re express\u00e9ment au ministre des Affaires indiennes le pouvoir de prendre des d\u00e9cisions sur des questions strat\u00e9giques ayant trait au financement de l'entretien des enfants autochtones qui fr\u00e9quentent un pensionnat. En l'occurrence, le Ministre avait pris le parti d'exiger que les enfants autochtones fr\u00e9quentent l'\u00e9cole la plus proche de leur lieu de r\u00e9sidence, pr\u00e9cisant que le gouvernement n'assumerait plus les d\u00e9penses pour ceux qui souhaitaient fr\u00e9quenter des \u00e9coles confessionnelles situ\u00e9es loin de chez eux. Par ailleurs, l'article 118 de la Loi sur les Indiens pr\u00e9cisait que les enfants catholiques ne pouvaient \u00eatre envoy\u00e9s dans des \u00e9coles protestantes sans le consentement des parents.\n[15] La partie plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce avait une fille qui fr\u00e9quentait une \u00e9cole catholique loin de chez elle et s'est vu refuser une aide gouvernementale. Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a refus\u00e9 d'exercer sa comp\u00e9tence pour le motif que la d\u00e9cision du ministre relative au financement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens et n'\u00e9tait pas, par cons\u00e9quent, soumise \u00e0 l'application de la Loi. Appel\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait sienne la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle la politique adopt\u00e9e par le minist\u00e8re avait \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, de ce fait, assujettie \u00e0 l'article 67 de la Loi.\n[16] Le cas suivant est Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Conseil de la Bande de Gordon, [2001] 1 C.F. 124 (C.A.F.). En l'occurrence, le plaignant \u00e9tait une Indienne inscrite qui r\u00e9sidait au sein de la r\u00e9serve de la Bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Gordon avec son conjoint, un non-Indien. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de logement locatif dans la r\u00e9serve, \u00e0 laquelle le Conseil de bande n'a pas fait droit. Elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne une plainte, faisant valoir que le Conseil de bande avait exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et la situation de famille. Le Tribunal a conclu qu'il n'avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte en raison de l'article 67 de la Loi. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a finalement entendu l'affaire et a statu\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de refuser un logement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par le Conseil de bande aux termes de l'article 20 de la Loi sur les Indiens, qui conf\u00e8re au Conseil de bande le pouvoir de s'occuper de la possession des terres dans la r\u00e9serve.\n[17] Le premier cas dans la deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie est Desjarlais c. Bande de Piapot, no 75 [1989] 3 C.F. 605 (C.A.F.). En l'occurrence, la Bande avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 son administrateur conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une r\u00e9solution officielle du Conseil de bande. La r\u00e9solution consistait en un vote de non-confiance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Mme Rose Desjarlais et \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur des plaintes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 cause de son \u00e2ge. Le Conseil de bande a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi; elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne une plainte dans laquelle elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de son \u00e2ge.\n[18] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que rien n'est pr\u00e9vu express\u00e9ment ou implicitement dans la Loi sur les Indiens en ce qui touche les votes de non-confiance. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour a jug\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'une d\u00e9cision prise en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens et que la plainte pouvait \u00eatre entendue par le Tribunal.\n[19] Le dernier cas est l'affaire MacNutt c. Bande indienne de Shubenacadie, [1998] 2 C.F. 198 (C.F., 1re inst.); 256 N.R. 109 (C.A.F.). En l'occurrence, une conjointe non indienne qui vivait dans la r\u00e9serve avec la permission du Conseil de bande s'est vu refuser des prestations d'aide sociale par la bande. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral avait conclu avec la Bande une entente contractuelle au sujet de l'octroi de prestations d'aide sociale aux r\u00e9sidents de la r\u00e9serve. Le Conseil de bande \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 d'administrer le programme d'aide sociale conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'entente contractuelle, qui renfermait des lignes directrices. En vertu de l'article 3.01 des lignes directrices, un conjoint non indien qui r\u00e9sidait l\u00e9galement dans la r\u00e9serve \u00e9tait clairement admissible \u00e0 des prestations.\n[20] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soutenu que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande de refuser de verser des prestations n'\u00e9tait pas soumise \u00e0 l'article 67 de la Loi. Il s'agissait d'une d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande; cependant, la Cour a soulign\u00e9 que les d\u00e9cisions d'un conseil de bande ne sont pas toutes prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par l'article 67 de la Loi. Les programmes d'aide sociale et le pouvoir de la Bande de l'administrer \u00e9taient assujettis \u00e0 l'entente contractuelle conclue entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et la Bande, et non \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'article 67 de la Loi ne s'appliquait pas.\n[21] L'intim\u00e9 a convenu que si la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande \u00e9tait une d\u00e9cision de dotation, l'article 67 n'aurait pas pour effet de priver le Tribunal de sa comp\u00e9tence. Cependant, l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande doit \u00eatre vue comme un tout. Ce qui \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue semble \u00eatre une question de dotation s'inscrit, en fait, dans une strat\u00e9gie financi\u00e8re globale visant \u00e0 r\u00e9duire le d\u00e9ficit de la bande.\n[22] L'intim\u00e9 a d'abord cit\u00e9 les articles 69, 81 et 83 de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 l'appui de la d\u00e9cision de nature financi\u00e8re prise par le Conseil de bande en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens. Cependant, en derni\u00e8re analyse, l'intim\u00e9 a examin\u00e9 deux r\u00e8glements d'application de la Loi sur les Indiens. Le premier de ces r\u00e8glements est le D\u00e9cret sur le revenu des bandes d'Indiens, DORS\/90-297 (version modifi\u00e9e), qui pr\u00e9voit que les bandes \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans le r\u00e8glement sont autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler, administrer et d\u00e9penser l'argent de leurs comptes de revenu. Le deuxi\u00e8me est le R\u00e8glement sur le revenu des bandes d'Indiens, C.R.C. 1978, ch. 953 (version modifi\u00e9e), qui pr\u00e9voit que toute d\u00e9pense qu'une bande effectue sur les deniers de son revenu est soumise aux prescriptions de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[23] L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que ces deux r\u00e8glements permettent au Conseil de bande d'administrer, de contr\u00f4ler et de d\u00e9penser les deniers de son revenu, activit\u00e9s qui sont soumises \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le remaniement des t\u00e2ches et la dotation des deux postes par le Conseil de bande ont surtout \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9s par des raisons financi\u00e8res et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s en vertu de ces r\u00e8glements, force est de conclure que la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens.\nPOSITION DE LA COMMISSION [24] La Commission adopte la position contraire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande. De l'avis de la Commission, la dotation du poste de travailleur\/travailleuse en service social familial \u00e9tait la principale raison d'\u00eatre de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande. La soi-disant d\u00e9cision financi\u00e8re ne correspond pas \u00e0 une strat\u00e9gie mentionn\u00e9e dans l'un ou l'autre des expos\u00e9s de position \u00e9labor\u00e9s par le Comit\u00e9 des finances et du personnel. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s que la d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9 de recrutement eut \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e et renvoy\u00e9e au Comit\u00e9 des finances que la recommandation consistant \u00e0 remanier les t\u00e2ches a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\na) Argumentation juridique [25] La Commission a cit\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de ce Tribunal : Bernard c. Conseil scolaire de Waycobah, (1999), 36 C.H.R.R. D\/51 (TCDP). En l'occurrence, la plaignante \u00e9tait membre de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Waycobah. Le Conseil scolaire avait mis fin \u00e0 son emploi de secr\u00e9taire d'\u00e9cole en raison de la conduite qu'elle avait manifest\u00e9e \u00e0 deux ou trois reprises et qui avait amen\u00e9 le Conseil \u00e0 croire qu'elle \u00e9tait atteinte de d\u00e9ficience mentale. Elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission une plainte, all\u00e9guant que le Conseil avait exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\n[26] L'intim\u00e9 a soutenu que le paragraphe 114 (2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, qui autorise le Ministre \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, diriger et entretenir des \u00e9coles pour les enfants indiens, habilitait le Conseil scolaire \u00e0 prendre la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 l'argument de l'intim\u00e9 voulant que le Tribunal n'ait pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte. \u00c0 son avis, il n'y avait pas un lien suffisant entre le paragraphe 114 (2) et la d\u00e9cision du Conseil.\nANALYSE ET CONCLUSION [27] \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9 comporte \u00e0 la fois un aspect dotation et un aspect financier. Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande avait surtout pour but de pourvoir le poste de travailleur\/travailleuse en service social familial. Le fait qu'il en ait d\u00e9coul\u00e9 un avantage financier minime n'alt\u00e8re pas cette conclusion.\n[28] Ce fait est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par la chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant la mise sur pied d'un comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection afin de pourvoir le poste de travailleur\/travailleuse en service social familial. Le choix du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9, ce qui a amen\u00e9 le Conseil de bande \u00e0 renvoyer la question au Comit\u00e9 des finances. Le renvoi n'\u00e9tait attribuable ni \u00e0 des consid\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res ni \u00e0 l'adoption d'une nouvelle strat\u00e9gie. Il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de pourvoir le poste pour lequel on avait allou\u00e9 de l'argent. Tout le processus a \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9 depuis le d\u00e9part par un besoin de dotation, et non par un besoin financier.\n[29] En outre, aucun des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents cit\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 ne s'apparente \u00e0 mon avis \u00e0 l'affaire qui nous int\u00e9resse. La similitude qui existe avec l'affaire Waycobah r\u00e9side particuli\u00e8rement dans le fait que les deux situations ont trait \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision de dotation. Dans Waycobah, il n'y avait pas de lien suffisant entre la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande et la Loi sur les Indiens. \u00c0 mon avis, aucune des dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens cit\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9, y compris les deux r\u00e8glements, ne cr\u00e9ent un tel lien\n[30] Toute d\u00e9cision de dotation implique le contr\u00f4le, l'administration et la d\u00e9pense de l'argent. La position de l'intim\u00e9 aurait pour cons\u00e9quence de soustraire \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal toute d\u00e9cision de dotation prise par un conseil de bande. M\u00eame l'intim\u00e9 a admis que ce ne pourrait ni ne devrait \u00eatre le cas en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens.\nORDONNANCE [31] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, la requ\u00eate du Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle Point et de Stony Point est par la pr\u00e9sente rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9 par\nJ.

Grant Sinclair Paul Groarke\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate porte sur l'objection \u00e0 la participation de la Commission \u00e0 l'audience qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e. Cette objection d\u00e9coule de la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre la Commission et l'intim\u00e9e, dans laquelle la Commission a inform\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re que sa participation \u00e0 l'audience se limiterait \u00e0 un expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire am\u00e9lior\u00e9 et un mandat d'observateur.\n[2] Dans une lettre en date du 10 octobre 2003 adress\u00e9e aux parties, la Commission pr\u00e9cise ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION] En ce qui concerne la participation de la Commission, il est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 ce moment-ci que notre r\u00f4le se limitera \u00e0 un expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire am\u00e9lior\u00e9 puis \u00e0 un mandat d'observateur pendant l'audience. Bien entendu, la Commission participera \u00e0 la mise en uvre et \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de toute ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal. Cela dit, la Commission se r\u00e9serve le droit de participer pleinement \u00e0 l'audience si elle le juge \u00e0 propos ou n\u00e9cessaire au vu du d\u00e9roulement de celle-ci.\nL'intim\u00e9e s'est dit insatisfaite de cette fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der.\n[3] Par la suite, l'intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 de plus amples explications quant \u00e0 la teneur de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire am\u00e9lior\u00e9. Dans une lettre en date du 30 octobre 2003, la Commission lui a fourni la r\u00e9ponse suivante :\n[TRADUCTION] Dans notre expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire, nous examinerons les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et les principes qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. Nous ne ferons pas r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et nous ne prendrons pas position sur la fa\u00e7on dont le Tribunal devrait aborder les questions qui pourraient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 la lueur des all\u00e9gations et des faits non prouv\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans le formulaire de plainte. Cet expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire qui, il faut le reconna\u00eetre, est non traditionnel vise \u00e0 mettre en relief les principes qui s'appliquent \u00e0 une affaire de cette nature. Nous ne chercherons pas dans notre expos\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer ou \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir ce que la preuve d\u00e9montrera au bout du compte.\nL'intim\u00e9e ne croit pas qu'il soit possible de restreindre ainsi la port\u00e9e de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire et s'oppose \u00e0 toute forme de participation autre qu'une participation pleine et enti\u00e8re de la Commission \u00e0 l'audience.\n[4] L'intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de statuer que la Commission ne peut restreindre ainsi sa participation \u00e0 l'audience. Elle a \u00e9galement soutenu que la Commission doit soit participer pleinement \u00e0 l'audience, soit se retirer de l'ensemble du processus. La Commission s'est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e, principalement pour le motif que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9terminer l'ampleur de la participation de la Commission \u00e0 l'audience. \u00c0 l'appui de cette pr\u00e9tention, l'avocat a invoqu\u00e9 surtout le principe que le Tribunal ne jouit d'aucun pouvoir de r\u00e9vision \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des d\u00e9cisions de la Commission.\n[5] Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 trait\u00e9 de la question de l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire dans Mowat c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2003 TCDP 39. Au cours de l'argumentation, l'avocat de la Commission nous a inform\u00e9s que l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire am\u00e9lior\u00e9 que la Commission envisageait de pr\u00e9senter en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait, de par sa nature et son contenu, similaire \u00e0 celui qu'elle pr\u00e9voyait pr\u00e9senter dans les affaires Howell c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes et McKay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada.\n[6] \u00c0 notre avis, la Commission est tenue de respecter la jurisprudence relative aux expos\u00e9s pr\u00e9liminaires, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal dans la pr\u00e9paration et la pr\u00e9sentation d'un tel expos\u00e9. L'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire a pour objet de donner un aper\u00e7u de ce qui va suivre. Si la Commission n'a pas l'intention de pr\u00e9senter de preuve ou de participer plus amplement \u00e0 l'affaire, l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire n'est gu\u00e8re utile. Selon la jurisprudence, il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture de l'audience toute observation sur l'\u00e9tat du droit.\n[7] Il incombe aux parties qui participent pleinement \u00e0 l'instance de cerner les questions \u00e0 d\u00e9battre \u00e0 l'audience. Si la Commission veut jouer un r\u00f4le dans un tel processus, elle a donc l'obligation de contribuer \u00e0 la production de la preuve et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation d'arguments en temps utile. Il serait injuste que la Commission soul\u00e8ve des questions auxquelles devraient r\u00e9pondre, en son absence, les autres parties au processus.\n[8] Notre d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Mowat indique clairement que nous n'admettons pas que la Commission qualifie la question de pr\u00e9judicielle. Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet qu'il n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9viser les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission, pouvoir qui est d\u00e9volu \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. N\u00e9anmoins, le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure et a la responsabilit\u00e9 de veiller \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure respecte les principes de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle.\n[9] Passons maintenant \u00e0 la question du mandat d'observateur. Le terme mandat d'observateur pr\u00eate \u00e0 interpr\u00e9tation. \u00c0 ce moment-ci, nous ne savons pas clairement ce que la Commission entend par l\u00e0. Il ne fait aucun doute que la Commission a le droit de participer comme bon lui semble \u00e0 toute audience du Tribunal, sous r\u00e9serve de la responsabilit\u00e9 du TCDP de veiller \u00e0 ce que les principes de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle soient respect\u00e9s.\n[10] Voil\u00e0 qui est suffisant \u00e0 notre avis pour trancher la requ\u00eate dont nous sommes saisis. La Commission ne sera pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter au d\u00e9but de l'audience l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire pr\u00e9vu. L'\u00e9tendue de l'obligation de la Commission de participer pleinement, ou de ne pas participer du tout, \u00e0 une audience est une question qui rel\u00e8ve de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Toute autre question soulev\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e en ce qui touche la participation de la Commission peut \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e par les membres instructeurs.\nJ.

INTRODUCTION [1] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter comme parties intim\u00e9es \u00e0 l'instance le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et des Services gouvernementaux et l'Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada. Cette requ\u00eate fait suite \u00e0 une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne au sujet de l'escalier York, qui se trouve dans le secteur du march\u00e9, au centre-ville d'Ottawa, \u00e0 l'est de la colline du Parlement et de l'h\u00f4tel Ch\u00e2teau Laurier. Cet escalier, qui rel\u00e8ve de la Commission de la capitale nationale (CCN), l'intim\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce, a r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 reconstruit par suite de l'\u00e9rection de la nouvelle ambassade des \u00c9tats-Unis. La CCN est charg\u00e9e de l'am\u00e9nagement, de la conservation et de l'embellissement de la capitale nationale afin d'en pr\u00e9server le cachet et le caract\u00e8re.\n[2] Toutes les parties admettent que la rue York est l'une des principales art\u00e8res dans le secteur du march\u00e9. Elle se termine \u00e0 l'intersection en T \u00e0 l'ouest de la promenade Sussex. \u00c0 l'endroit o\u00f9 se trouve la barre du T, il y a une pente abrupte entre la promenade Sussex et la rue Mackenzie. Juste de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rue, \u00e0 cette m\u00eame intersection, se trouve l'escalier York, qui permet d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la rue Mackenzie. De l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rue Mackenzie, il y a l'entr\u00e9e du parc Major, qui offre une vue imprenable sur la colline du Parlement et la rivi\u00e8re des Outaouais et o\u00f9 se tiennent fr\u00e9quemment des festivals.\n[3] Le plaignant se d\u00e9place en fauteuil roulant. Il all\u00e8gue que la Commission de la capitale nationale a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience en ne lui donnant pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la rue Mackenzie \u00e0 la hauteur de l'escalier York. Le plaignant et la Commission veulent corriger cette situation. Ils se plaignent du fait que l'escalier est inaccessible aux personnes en fauteuil roulant et, en fait, \u00e0 quiconque est physiquement inapte \u00e0 le monter ou le descendre. Le plaignant et la Commission ont fait valoir que la plainte soul\u00e8ve d'importantes questions en ce qui touche l'acc\u00e8s universel.\n[4] L'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9but\u00e9. Le plaignant a fini de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve. La Commission a commenc\u00e9 l'interrogatoire principal de David Lloyd Rapson, un expert en mati\u00e8re d'acc\u00e8s universel. La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate d\u00e9coule du fait que M. Rapson a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il existe une solution \u00e9vidente au probl\u00e8me d'acc\u00e8s que pose l'escalier de la rue York. Cette solution se trouve juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9.\n[5] L'escalier est d\u00e9tenu par la Commission de la capitale nationale au nom de la Couronne. Imm\u00e9diatement au sud de l'escalier se trouve un vaste b\u00e2timent historique d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous le nom d'immeuble Connaught. Cet immeuble est d\u00e9tenu par le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics, \u00e9galement au nom de la Couronne. Selon M. Rapson, on pourrait offrir aux personnes qui ne peuvent emprunter l'escalier York un moyen d'acc\u00e8s de rechange \u00e0 la rue Mackenzie via l'immeuble Connaught.\n[6] L'immeuble Connaught est un gros b\u00e2timent en pierre, de forme oblongue, situ\u00e9 entre la promenade Sussex et la rue Mackenzie dans l'axe nord-sud. Avec ses tours cr\u00e9nel\u00e9es et ses contreforts de pierre, le b\u00e2timent a une allure m\u00e9di\u00e9vale plut\u00f4t s\u00e9v\u00e8re. L'immeuble \u00e9tant construit \u00e0 flanc de colline et la rue Mackenzie se situant en contre-haut par rapport \u00e0 la promenade Sussex, l'entr\u00e9e avant se trouve trois \u00e9tages plus haut que l'entr\u00e9e arri\u00e8re.\n[7] Lorsqu'il a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 l'emplacement \u00e0 partir de la rue York, M. Rapson a d\u00e9couvert du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la promenade Sussex une entr\u00e9e abandonn\u00e9e qui est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 nord de l'immeuble et qui est contigu\u00eb \u00e0 l'escalier York. Il a \u00e9galement constat\u00e9 qu'il y a une cage d'ascenseur \u00e0 ce bout de l'immeuble. Trois \u00e9tages plus haut se trouve une sortie principale donnant sur la rue Mackenzie. M. Rapson a indiqu\u00e9 que cette cage d'ascenseur pourrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour passer d'une rue \u00e0 l'autre. Cette solution serait probablement moins co\u00fbteuse que l'am\u00e9nagement d'un ascenseur ou d'un appareil \u00e9l\u00e9vateur l\u00e0 o\u00f9 se trouve l'escalier.\n[8] La Commission a joint \u00e0 son avis de requ\u00eate un affidavit auquel sont annex\u00e9es des copies des lettres que la CCN et le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9es au sujet de l'immeuble Connaught. Il est \u00e9vident \u00e0 la lecture de cette correspondance, et d'apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages entendus jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant, que certaines enqu\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es. Le rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire de l'enqu\u00eateur, dont que j'ai devant moi, pr\u00e9cise que l'intim\u00e9e devrait consulter qui de droit afin de garantir l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'immeuble. Toutefois, il semble que les n\u00e9gociations entre les diverses parties soient tomb\u00e9es \u00e0 l'eau \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9.\n[9] Durant le t\u00e9moignage en interrogation principal de M. Rapson, j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission si elle souhaitait que le Tribunal se penche sur la possibilit\u00e9 d'utiliser l'immeuble Connaught comme autre moyen d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la rue Mackenzie. Il est \u00e9vident qu'il faudrait, pour ce faire, rendre une ordonnance exigeant que le propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble Connaught rende le lieu accessible au public. Cela impliquerait \u00e9galement de rendre une ordonnance exigeant que l'immeuble fasse l'objet de modifications. Lorsque la Commission a confirm\u00e9 qu'elle demandait ce genre de redressement, j'ai d\u00e9plor\u00e9 le fait que le propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble Connaught ne soit pas devant le Tribunal.\n[10] L'audience a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e afin que l'avocat de la Commission puisse recevoir des instructions. La Commission a ensuite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, qui vise \u00e0 ajouter comme parties intim\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et l'Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada. L'immeuble appartient au minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics, mais est lou\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada. Lors de l'audition de la requ\u00eate, le minist\u00e8re de la Justice a agi au nom de ces parties. Toutes les parties ont convenu qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de demander une ordonnance visant \u00e0 ajouter comme partie intim\u00e9e l'Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada.\n[11] Le plaignant a clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que son but est d'obtenir une forme quelconque d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la rue Mackenzie \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 se dresse l'escalier. Il appuie n\u00e9anmoins la requ\u00eate et estime que le Tribunal devrait examiner la possibilit\u00e9 d'offrir un moyen d'acc\u00e8s de rechange via l'immeuble Connaught. Le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics s'oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. La CCN n'a pris aucune position, indiquant qu'elle laissait au Tribunal le soin de trancher la question.\nII. LES POSITIONS DES PARTIES [12] La Commission soutient que le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics devrait \u00eatre constitu\u00e9 comme partie intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte aux fins du redressement. Bien qu'elle pr\u00e9tende que le plaignant ait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 directement victime de discrimination de la part du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics, la Commission ne s'appuie pas sur une telle pr\u00e9tention aux fins de la requ\u00eate. Je crois qu'elle veut donner \u00e0 entendre qu'un refus d'aider \u00e0 corriger une situation discriminatoire peut constituer en soi une forme de discrimination directe.\n[13] La pr\u00e9occupation imm\u00e9diate de la Commission est que le Tribunal ne soit peut-\u00eatre pas en mesure d'ordonner l'adoption des mesures de redressement appropri\u00e9es sans la participation du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics, ce qui irait implicitement \u00e0 l'encontre des objets de la Loi. Le plaignant a fait siennes les observations de la Commission.\n[14] Aucune explication n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie au Tribunal quant aux raisons pour lesquelles la Commission n'a pas constitu\u00e9 comme partie intim\u00e9e le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics avant le renvoi de la plainte. Force est de conclure qu'il s'agit d'une erreur de la Commission. Bien qu'elle reconnaisse que le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t comme partie intim\u00e9e, la Commission est d'avis que l'ajournement de la proc\u00e9dure et la production de documents permettraient de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 tout pr\u00e9judice.\n[15] Le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics s'oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, principalement pour des raisons de comp\u00e9tence. Il soutient que le Tribunal n'a pas la comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 ajouter une partie comme intim\u00e9e sans une all\u00e9gation voulant que cette derni\u00e8re ait exerc\u00e9 une discrimination contre le plaignant. \u00c0 mon avis, il faut interpr\u00e9ter cette prise de position, pour des raisons qui deviendront \u00e9videntes, comme une pr\u00e9tention que le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics ne peut \u00eatre constitu\u00e9 comme partie intim\u00e9e sans une all\u00e9gation voulant qu'il ait directement exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit du plaignant \u00e0 titre de partie principale.\n[16] De plus, le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics a fait valoir que la Commission n'a pas respect\u00e9 les d\u00e9lais prescrits, argument que cette derni\u00e8re a r\u00e9fut\u00e9 en indiquant qu'il s'agit d'une plainte continue. Un troisi\u00e8me argument veut que la constitution du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics comme partie intim\u00e9e \u00e0 ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure soit pr\u00e9judiciable.\nIII. LE POUVOIR DU TRIBUNAL D'AJOUTER DES PARTIES [17] La jurisprudence du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne concernant l'adjonction de parties est r\u00e9cente. Dans une d\u00e9cision rendue oralement dans Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, T701\/0602, 2 octobre 2002, vol. 1, p. 46, la pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish fait remarquer que le paragraphe 48.9(2) de la Loi [canadienne des droits de la personne] pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment l'adjonction de parties et de parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es aux instances devant le Tribunal. La disposition en question conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles r\u00e9gissant l'adjonction de parties aux instances.\n[18] Bien que le Tribunal soit en train de r\u00e9viser ses r\u00e8gles, les r\u00e8gles actuelles passent cette question sous silence. Cependant, la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e dans un certain nombre de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et la Loi n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. \u00c0 mon avis, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ajouter une partie \u00e0 une plainte une fois que celle-ci lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e. Le fait que l'audience du Tribunal soit une instruction me conforte dans cette opinion, car il donne \u00e0 croire qu'une telle proc\u00e9dure comporte un aspect exploratoire qu'on ne retrouve pas n\u00e9cessairement dans d'autres formes de contentieux.\n[19] J'ai examin\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles de Cour de divers tribunaux d'instance sup\u00e9rieure. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ces textes pr\u00e9cisent que le tribunal peut ajouter une partie lorsqu'une telle mesure est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher toutes les questions en litige et r\u00e9soudre efficacement et compl\u00e8tement l'affaire en question. D'autres membres ont soutenu que le pouvoir du TCDP d'ajouter des parties devrait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 uniquement lorsque cela est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tudier \u00e0 fond la plainte. Il y a de multiples raisons \u00e0 cela. Il va sans dire, par exemple, qu'une partie qui est ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 une instance dans des circonstances comme celles en l'esp\u00e8ce ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie pas du processus d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission.\n[20] La d\u00e9cision la plus r\u00e9cente du Tribunal est celle intitul\u00e9e Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone c. Telus Comunications, 2003 TCDP 31, o\u00f9 le membre Deschamps affirme au paragraphe 30 ce qui suit :\nLe Tribunal est d'avis que l'adjonction forc\u00e9e d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 une fois que le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 d'instruire une plainte est appropri\u00e9e, en l'absence de r\u00e8gles formelles \u00e0 cet effet, s'il est \u00e9tabli que la pr\u00e9sence de cette nouvelle partie est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte dont il est saisi et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible une fois la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission que l'adjonction d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 serait n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte.\nJ'accepte cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u00e9crivant l'\u00e9tat du droit.\n[21] Cependant, dans l'affaire Telus, les faits \u00e9taient essentiellement diff\u00e9rents. Il s'agissait davantage d'une requ\u00eate visant l'adjonction d'une tierce partie. C'est une distinction importante : la requ\u00eate visant l'adjonction d'une partie \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9tention que le syndicat \u00e9tait directement et fondamentalement responsable. La r\u00e9paration que cherchait \u00e0 obtenir la partie plaignante \u00e9tait \u00e9galement un redressement en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 compromis par l'omission d'ajouter le syndicat comme partie intim\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'adjonction du syndicat n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, au sens strict du terme, pour r\u00e9soudre les questions en litige.\n[22] \u00c0 mon avis, il existe en l'esp\u00e8ce un \u00e9l\u00e9ment suppl\u00e9mentaire qui est plus important que la question de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9. La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne a pour objet de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination; le pouvoir du Tribunal d'ajouter des parties doit \u00eatre subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 cet objet. Cela nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 parler de la nature du processus. Bien que le Tribunal se prononce sur les droits et obligations individuels des parties qui comparaissent devant lui, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il s'agit de droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Loi, les instances en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne comportent un volet constitutionnel qui est souvent absent en droit civil.\n[23] Cette observation soul\u00e8ve des pr\u00e9occupations d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu'on ne retrouve pas dans les instances civiles. \u00c0 mon avis, les litiges que tranche le Tribunal sont des affaires d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, et ce, m\u00eame lorsqu'ils mettent en cause des int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s des parties. Les r\u00e8gles civiles relatives \u00e0 l'adjonction de parties doivent \u00eatre adapt\u00e9es au mandat du Tribunal, qui est d'assurer une r\u00e9paration efficace en cas de discrimination. S'il est n\u00e9cessaire d'ajouter le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics comme partie intim\u00e9e afin de permettre le genre de r\u00e9paration pr\u00e9vu par la Loi, il me semble que cet objet l'emporte sur le manque de pr\u00e9voyance de la Commission.\nIV. ARTICLE 53 DE LA LOI [24] L'argument invoqu\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics relativement \u00e0 la question de comp\u00e9tence est fond\u00e9 sur le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Ce paragraphe pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 de rendre une ordonnance contre la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics soutient qu'il ne peut \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 comme partie sans une preuve digne de foi sur laquelle le Tribunal pourrait s'appuyer pour conclure qu'il s'agit de la personne coupable de l'acte discriminatoire.\n[25] D'apr\u00e8s ce que je crois comprendre, la Commission n'a pas l'intention imm\u00e9diat de demander qu'on d\u00e9termine que le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics est la partie principale directement responsable de l'acte discriminatoire; elle cherche plut\u00f4t \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance accessoire de quelque sorte qui lui permettrait d'ex\u00e9cuter de la fa\u00e7on la plus appropri\u00e9e une d\u00e9cision contre la CCN. Soit dit en passant, je ne crois pas qu'il soit honn\u00eate de la part de la Commission de diff\u00e9rer sa prise de position sur la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics en tant que partie principale.\n[26] Le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics a fait valoir qu'il ne devrait pas \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 comme partie simplement parce qu'il fait partie de l'appareil d'\u00c9tat. La r\u00e9plique de la Commission \u00e0 cet argument semble \u00eatre double. D'abord, la Commission r\u00e9torque que la CCN et le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une personne aux fins du redressement pr\u00e9vu par l'article 53 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Ensuite, elle pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de rendre toute ordonnance accessoire n\u00e9cessaire pour faciliter la mise en uvre des ordonnances pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 53.\nA. Le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics en tant que personne [27] J'ai d'abord exprim\u00e9 certaines r\u00e9serves \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du premier argument invoqu\u00e9 par la Commission. La CCN et le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics sont des personnes distinctes en droit. Le fait que ces organismes aient leurs propres budgets et responsabilit\u00e9s est une caract\u00e9ristique importante sur le plan de l'identit\u00e9 juridique. Ce serait une erreur de penser que le Tribunal pourrait fusionner leurs identit\u00e9s aux fins de l'audience.\n[28] Il y a n\u00e9anmoins du vrai dans l'argument invoqu\u00e9 par la Commission. La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est une loi r\u00e9paratrice et il faut donner au mot personne une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale. Bien que le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et la CCN soient distincts en droit, il s'agit de deux cr\u00e9atures de la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Toutes les parties admettent que le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sous-jacent \u00e0 chacun des deux biens immeubles est d\u00e9tenu par la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il n'est tout simplement pas suffisant en droit de dire qu'il s'agit de biens appartenant \u00e0 des personnes juridiques diff\u00e9rentes.\n[29] La situation pourrait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente si la CCN et le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics \u00e9taient des parties priv\u00e9es. Toutefois, m\u00eame dans un tel cas, on pourrait imaginer une situation o\u00f9 des biens adjacents appartiennent \u00e0 des entreprises diff\u00e9rentes, A et B, qui sont chacune d\u00e9tenues par une entreprise tierce, C. A et B seraient des entit\u00e9s distinctes en droit, mais elles seraient toutes deux subordonn\u00e9es aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de C et on pourrait imaginer des situations o\u00f9 une cour ou un tribunal pourrait juger n\u00e9cessaire pour lever le voile corporatif qui les s\u00e9pare.\n[30] Il convient ici d'examiner la question de l'indivisibilit\u00e9 de la Couronne. C'est un concept qui comporte de multiples limites. Dans son ouvrage intitul\u00e9 Liability of the Crown (Toronto : Carswell, 1989), le professeur Hogg, par exemple, \u00e9crit \u00e0 la page 10 :\n[TRADUCTION] Une seule reine (ou un seul roi) peut occuper le tr\u00f4ne. La Couronne a donc une connotation monolithique, qui a parfois \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e dans des formules telles que la Couronne est une et indivisible. L'id\u00e9e voulant que la Couronne soit une et indivisible est, pour ainsi dire, pour le moins trompeuse...\nCependant, le cas qui nous occupe est peut-\u00eatre un des rares o\u00f9 le concept d'unit\u00e9 de la Couronne est important.\n[31] La Couronne porte un int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier \u00e0 la lutte contre la discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, on peut penser que toute d\u00e9volution de pouvoirs de la Couronne comporte une part de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Si la Couronne porte un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 la lutte contre la discrimination, on peut, par cons\u00e9quent, pr\u00e9tendre que ses fonctionnaires partagent cet int\u00e9r\u00eat. L'argument est que cet int\u00e9r\u00eat ne s'arr\u00eate pas arbitrairement \u00e0 la porte de ses repr\u00e9sentants. Cela pourrait \u00eatre suffisant pour lier l'identit\u00e9 de la CCN et celle du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics aux fins de l'article 53.\n[32] Il y a peut \u00eatre lieu de se demander si, du point de vue juridique, une part de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la Couronne \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination rejaillit sur les responsabilit\u00e9s de ses repr\u00e9sentants et les fins qu'ils poursuivent. Il semble que la Commission estime qu'il existe un lien suffisant pour joindre les personnes de la CCN et du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics aux fins du redressement pr\u00e9vu par l'article 53 de la Loi. On peut dire en un sens que la CCN, \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant de la Couronne et de propri\u00e9taire de l'escalier York, partage l'identit\u00e9 du repr\u00e9sentant de la Couronne qui poss\u00e8de l'immeuble adjacent.\n[33] La Commission a cit\u00e9 des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, principalement Canadian Pacifique c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) [1991] 1 C.F. 571 (C.A.) et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Rosin [1991] 1 C.F. 391 (C.A.), qui d\u00e9montrent que le Tribunal ne devrait pas s'en tenir aux prescriptions particuli\u00e8res de la Loi dans l'interpr\u00e9tation de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne. Cependant, la question \u00e0 ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure consiste simplement \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la Commission a soulev\u00e9 un motif litigieux recevable. Je dois me prononcer sur une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, et il serait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 que je me lance dans une analyse du droit.\n[34] Cette observation est d'autant plus pertinente que je ne me suis pas encore prononc\u00e9 sur les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce. De multiples raisons emp\u00eachent peut-\u00eatre d'utiliser l'immeuble Connaught comme autre moyen d'acc\u00e8s possible. Toutefois, il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 d\u00e9battre \u00e0 l'audience. La seule question que je dois trancher est la suivante : le Tribunal doit-il instruire la plainte? Cela est impossible sans la participation du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics \u00e0 l'audience.\nB. La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'ajouter une partie aux fins du redressement [35] La deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9plique de la Commission aux arguments invoqu\u00e9s par le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics aux termes de l'article 53 de la Loi est que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de rendre des ordonnances suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 l'appui de toute conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9. En vertu de ce pouvoir, le Tribunal serait habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre une ordonnance contre une partie aux seules fins du redressement. De l'avis de la Commission, rendre une ordonnance contre la CCN dans le cas qui nous occupe ne serait d'aucune utilit\u00e9 sans une ordonnance suppl\u00e9mentaire contre le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics.\n[36] Il est important de faire preuve de circonspection \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la formulation de la r\u00e9plique de la Commission. Cette attitude s'impose, car il est pour le moins logique de croire qu'il ne saurait y avoir de redressement sans une forme quelconque de responsabilit\u00e9. L'argument qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, en fait, est que la responsabilit\u00e9 aux termes de la Loi ne se limite pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 ceux qui sont directement responsables des actes ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte. La Commission pr\u00e9tend que le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics est en quelque sorte responsable en vertu de l'article 53 moins directement et de fa\u00e7on secondaire, presque comme s'il avait contribu\u00e9 accessoirement \u00e0 la discrimination plut\u00f4t que d'\u00eatre l'artisan principal de celle-ci.\n[37] En vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, M. Brown a le droit aux plaisirs des libert\u00e9s et droits habituels sans faire l'objet de discrimination. L'argument veut que ce droit cr\u00e9e aux termes de la Loi des obligations r\u00e9elles, qui exigent que le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics collabore avec les autres parties pour tenter de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation soi-disant discriminatoire qui existerait \u00e0 l'escalier York. Il pourrait engendrer l'obligation d'aider la CCN \u00e0 composer avec les personnes qui pr\u00e9sentent une d\u00e9ficience. Les motifs d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont \u00e9vidents : sans une telle aide, la CCN ne serait peut-\u00eatre pas en mesure de rem\u00e9dier normalement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination.\n[38] Le fait pour un repr\u00e9sentant de la Couronne de ne pas offrir \u00e0 une personne handicap\u00e9e le m\u00eame acc\u00e8s physique \u00e0 un lieu public que celui offert aux autres personnes est un probl\u00e8me d'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui soul\u00e8ve des consid\u00e9rations diff\u00e9rentes de celles qui interviennent dans des questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'emploi, qui d\u00e9coulent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d'un diff\u00e9rend entre les parties adverses. S'il s'agit de donner \u00e0 M. Brown la possibilit\u00e9 d'exercer des droits qui, d'un certain point de vue th\u00e9orique, s'appliquent, en mati\u00e8re r\u00e9elle, contre le monde, les questions litigieuses en l'esp\u00e8ce ne sauraient se limiter aux parties au diff\u00e9rend qui nous occupe.\n[39] De l'avis de la Commission, les obligations du propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble Connaught vont au-del\u00e0 des interdictions ind\u00e9niables de la Loi, lorsqu'il s'agit de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation soi-disant discriminatoire \u00e0 l'escalier York. De toute \u00e9vidence, des aspects comme la faute sont moins importants dans ce contexte que le besoin primordial de trouver une solution viable au probl\u00e8me que pose l'escalier. Ce principe est conforme \u00e0 une grande partie de la jurisprudence - \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor) [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, paragraphe 11, en particulier. \u00c0 l'instar des autres personnes handicap\u00e9es, M. Brown ne s'int\u00e9resse pas vraiment \u00e0 l'appartenance des deux biens immeubles adjacents. Son postulat est tr\u00e8s simple. Il veut le m\u00eame acc\u00e8s que d'autres \u00e0 la rue Mackenzie.\n[40] Le probl\u00e8me ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9solu par voie d'indemnisation. Il faut une r\u00e9paration mat\u00e9rielle. Il existe en droit des cas (p. ex., expropriation) o\u00f9 les droits du public l'emportent sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats du propri\u00e9taire, priv\u00e9 ou public, du bien-fonds. Si l'aire d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un arr\u00eat d'autobus doit \u00eatre \u00e9largie, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes qui se d\u00e9placent en fauteuil roulant, il peut en r\u00e9sulter un empi\u00e9tement sur les droits du propri\u00e9taire d'un bien immeuble adjacent. Je suppose que la Commission n'a pas de r\u00e9ponse pour ceux qui disent le contraire : l'argument est simplement qu'il existe des cas o\u00f9 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne exige que nos int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s soient subordonn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun.\n[41] Le probl\u00e8me que pose la position adopt\u00e9e par le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics est qu'elle risque de laisser les victimes de discrimination sans v\u00e9ritable recours. Si je dois choisir entre le droit du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics de ne pas se m\u00ealer \u00e0 cette affaire et les droits des personnes handicap\u00e9es, je crois que la lecture de l'objet et du pr\u00e9ambule de la Loi dissiperait \u00e0 toutes fins utiles tout doute quant \u00e0 ce que je dois faire. La Commission a le droit de suivre la fili\u00e8re de la discrimination jusqu'\u00e0 la solution logique, compte tenu de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et ce, peu importe o\u00f9 cela peut la mener.\n[42] Si la Commission ou une autre partie est d'avis qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire d'ajouter une partie afin de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 une situation discriminatoire, elle est en droit \u00e0 mon avis de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate comme celle dont j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi. La question de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 interviendra toujours dans le cas d'une telle requ\u00eate. Toutefois, c'est une question qui a \u00e0 voir avec celle du pr\u00e9judice et non avec la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Je crois que la Loi accorde au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire -relativement informel - d'ajouter une partie si cela est conforme aux besoins de justice et \u00e0 l'objet de la Loi. Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que Me Hadjis a constitu\u00e9 une partie plaignante dans l'affaire Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail c. Barbe, T736\/4102, 6 mai 2003, vol. 2, pages 205 \u00e0 288, aux seuls fins de redressement.\n[43] On ne peut pas passer \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du fait que la Commission aurait d\u00fb pr\u00e9voir ce qui s'est produit en l'esp\u00e8ce et ajouter le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics comme partie \u00e0 la plainte avant de renvoyer celle-ci au Tribunal. Aussi regrettable que cette situation puisse \u00eatre, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est que le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics a peut-\u00eatre un r\u00f4le indispensable \u00e0 jouer pour r\u00e9soudre tout probl\u00e8me de discrimination qui se pose \u00e0 l'escalier York. Abstraction faite de tout le reste, j'ai peine \u00e0 comprendre pourquoi le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics obligerait la CCN \u00e0 opter pour une solution qui se r\u00e9v\u00e9lerait plus co\u00fbteuse pour le contribuable.\n[44] Si la plainte en l'esp\u00e8ce soulevait des questions d'int\u00e9r\u00eat priv\u00e9 relevant du droit civil, il pourrait en \u00eatre diff\u00e9remment. Toutefois, il ne s'agit pas d'un litige au civil et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public est primordial. La question de la discrimination est tout simplement trop importante pour \u00eatre contrecarr\u00e9e par de telles irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s en terme de proc\u00e9dure. Les pr\u00e9occupations publiques et constitutionnelles en l'esp\u00e8ce l'emportent sur toute faute imputable \u00e0 la Commission.\n[45] Je suis conscient du fait que la position de la Commission comporte de multiples cons\u00e9quences pour les parties, tant dans le cadre de l'audience qu'en dehors de celle-ci. Toutefois, la seule chose que je dois d\u00e9terminer pour l'instant, c'est si la Commission a le droit de soulever ces questions dans le cours de l'audience. \u00c0 mon avis, il faut r\u00e9pondre par l'affirmative. Je ne formule aucune conclusion quant au fond de la plainte, et rien n'emp\u00eache de d\u00e9battre de la question \u00e0 la fin de l'audience.\nV. PR\u00c9JUDICE [46] Le dernier argument soulev\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics est celui du pr\u00e9judice. Il repose essentiellement sur le fait que le minist\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 des avantages dont jouit habituellement la partie intim\u00e9e au cours du processus d'enqu\u00eate. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une importante consid\u00e9ration qui est contrebalanc\u00e9e par le fait que ce sera habituellement le cas si une partie intim\u00e9e est ajout\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal en vertu de la Loi.\n[47] En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, M. Brown pourrait d\u00e9poser demain une nouvelle plainte pour laquelle le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics serait la partie intim\u00e9e. La Commission pourrait ensuite renvoyer ladite plainte au Tribunal aux termes du paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi, qu'il y ait eu enqu\u00eate ou non. \u00c0 mon avis, il ne serait pas souhaitable de recourir \u00e0 des manuvres aussi formelles pour amener le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics devant le Tribunal.\n[48] L'id\u00e9e que le plaignant doit d\u00e9poser une deuxi\u00e8me plainte pour composer avec les probl\u00e8mes susceptibles de se pr\u00e9senter du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics est contraire \u00e0 l'esprit de la Loi. Cela ne ferait que retarder la satisfaction des droits dont le plaignant devrait peut-\u00eatre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier; de plus, il en r\u00e9sulterait un gaspillage des ressources rares dont dispose le syst\u00e8me de justice. Si le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics est \u00e0 bon droit partie \u00e0 l'instance, il doit \u00eatre constitu\u00e9 comme telle le plus rapidement possible afin que toutes les questions d\u00e9coulant de la plainte dont je suis saisi puissent \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9es facilement. Je ne vois aucune raison pour lesquelles l'on ne pourrait suppl\u00e9er aux lacunes du processus en donnant \u00e0 l'avocat du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour pr\u00e9parer son argumentation.\nVI. CONCLUSION ET DIRECTIVES [49] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne a pour objet de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination. Cette consid\u00e9ration est primordiale. \u00c0 mon avis, il serait inopportun de rejeter la requ\u00eate de la Commission et de risquer ainsi de priver le plaignant et le public du redressement appropri\u00e9, simplement parce que la Commission a commis une erreur dans le traitement de la plainte. Il s'agit davantage d'une question d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public que d'une question d'int\u00e9r\u00eat priv\u00e9, et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance.\n[50] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne que le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et des Services gouvernementaux soit constitu\u00e9 comme cointim\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce. Cette mesure, qui permettra la reprise de l'audience, est assujettie aux r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle. Par souci d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les autres parties, la Commission est tenue de se conformer aux dispositions de la r\u00e8gle 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et de faire tenir aux autres parties un expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des questions de droit, comme ceux qui sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s aux tribunaux civils (dans lesquels toutes les modifications sont marqu\u00e9es et bien en vue). Le cointim\u00e9 a le droit de conna\u00eetre la preuve pour une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re.\n[51] L'avocate du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics a d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 qu'il lui faudrait de trois \u00e0 quatre mois pour examiner les documents divulgu\u00e9s et pr\u00e9parer son argumentation. Je demande aux autres parties de bien vouloir se montrer conciliants \u00e0 son endroit \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il sera par ailleurs n\u00e9cessaire de rappeler le plaignant pour le contre-interroger. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Rapson pourra se poursuivre. Je demande aux parties de bien vouloir discuter entre elles de l'ordre dans lequel les t\u00e9moins devraient \u00eatre cit\u00e9s apr\u00e8s la reprise de l'audience.\n[52] Un autre aspect est digne de mention. Il semble qu'il y ait eu de longues n\u00e9gociations pour tenter de r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me qui persiste \u00e0 l'escalier. Comme il s'agit de l'entr\u00e9e en sc\u00e8ne du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics, il serait peut-\u00eatre possible de r\u00e9examiner ces n\u00e9gociations et de r\u00e9soudre de fa\u00e7on informelle certains aspects du probl\u00e8me. Si le Tribunal peut \u00eatre de quelque utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, les parties sont pri\u00e9es de communiquer avec l'agent du greffe du Tribunal en cons\u00e9quence.\nPaul Groarke\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 9 d\u00e9cembre 2003\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT760\/1003\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nBob Brown c.

INTRODUCTION\nII. LES FAITS\nIII. QUESTION EN LITIGE LORS DE L'OBJECTION PR\u00c9LIMINAIRE\nIV. ANALYSE JURIDIQUE\nV. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le 27 ao\u00fbt 2003, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e, M e Robert Bonhomme, faisait valoir une objection pr\u00e9liminaire quant \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal ) de disposer de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d'une disposition de sa loi habilitante. Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, il soul\u00e8ve que le Tribunal n'a pas la comp\u00e9tence de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question pos\u00e9e par la plaignante quant \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi )1.\n[2] Suite \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique tenue le 11 septembre 2003, il fut convenu que la question de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal serait d\u00e9battue en premier et que les questions portant sur le fond seraient abord\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sur l'objection pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[3] L'audience sur l'objection pr\u00e9liminaire a eu lieu \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al le 17 novembre 2003.\nII. LES FAITS [4] Francine Laurendeau (la plaignante ), a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada (l' intim\u00e9e ) \u00e0 compter de l'ann\u00e9e 1973, d'abord \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9alisatrice et \u00e0 compter de 1989, \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9alisatrice et d'animatrice \u00e0 la cha\u00eene culturelle de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[5] Le 12 juillet 2001, l'intim\u00e9e met la plaignante \u00e0 la retraite. Cette d\u00e9cision fut prise en vertu d'une politique appliqu\u00e9e chez l'intim\u00e9e depuis 1978 et intitul\u00e9e Politique des ressources humaines n10.0, laquelle pr\u00e9cise: Le moment de la retraite s'\u00e9tablit en fonction de l'\u00e2ge et est fix\u00e9 au dernier jour ouvrable du mois o\u00f9 l'employ\u00e9(e) atteint 65 ans.\n[6] En anticipation de cette mise \u00e0 la retraite, la plaignante d\u00e9posait le 6 juin 2001 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission ) afin de contester la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e. Dans sa plainte, elle all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9e a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers [elle] en maintenant une politique de retraite obligatoire, en raison de [son] \u00e2ge (65 ans), contrairement aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[7] Le 26 novembre 2002, l'enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission d\u00e9posait son rapport d'enqu\u00eate sur la plainte. Compte tenu de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c)2 , l'enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission recommandait qu' en vertu de [l'alin\u00e9a] 44(3)b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, que la Commission rejette la plainte. Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception de ce rapport, la Commission invitait la Plaignante \u00e0 lui faire des repr\u00e9sentations suppl\u00e9mentaires, ce qu'elle fit le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2002.\n[8] Le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2003, la Commission informait la plaignante et l'intim\u00e9e de sa d\u00e9cision, suite au rapport d'enqu\u00eate. Entre autres, elle indiquait:\nApr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 cette information, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu de l'article 49 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne qu'elle demandera \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte parce qu'elle est convaincue que, compte tenu des circonstances, l'instruction de celle-ci est justifi\u00e9e.\n[9] Le 1 er avril 2003, le registraire du Tribunal informait les parties de leur droit en vertu du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, de pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations juridiques \u00e0 l'appui de leur position dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier. En conformit\u00e9 avec les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal, celui-ci demandait \u00e9galement aux parties de soumettre de brefs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e9crits dans le but d'\u00e9num\u00e9rer les questions en litige, ainsi que la preuve qui sera soumise au Tribunal.\n[10] Dans sa divulgation de la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 20 ao\u00fbt 2003, la plaignante a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 les questions en litige comme suit:\nLa SRC a-t-elle exerc\u00e9 un acte discriminatoire sur la base de l'\u00e2ge en violation de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne en mettant fin \u00e0 l'emploi de Mme Laurendeau sur la seule et unique base qu'elle avait atteint l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans? Subsidiairement et dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le Tribunal en venait \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte discriminatoire de la SRC tombait sous l'exception de l'article 15(1)c), cet article de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est-il inconstitutionnel parce que contraire \u00e0 l'article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[11] Le 27 ao\u00fbt 2003, l'intim\u00e9e faisait savoir au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal ) qu'elle entendait soulever une objection pr\u00e9liminaire et faire valoir que le Tribunal n'a pas la comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question soulev\u00e9e par la plaignante \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la Loi.\nIII. QUESTION EN LITIGE LORS DE L'OBJECTION PR\u00c9LIMINAIRE [12] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a-t-il la comp\u00e9tence pour trancher une question portant sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d'une disposition de sa loi habilitante, notamment, l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la Loi?\nIV. ANALYSE JURIDIQUE [13] La question relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence d'un tribunal administratif de trancher une question portant sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d'une disposition de sa loi habilitante a fait l'objet de plusieurs d\u00e9cisions de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Nous n'avons qu'\u00e0 penser aux d\u00e9cisions de cette Cour dans les affaires Douglas\/Kwanten, Faculty Assn. c. Douglas College 3 , Cuddy Chicks Ltd. c. Ontario (Commission des relations de travail)4 , T\u00e9treault-Gadoury c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'immigration)5 , Cooper c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne)6 et, plus r\u00e9cemment, dans Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Workers' Compensation Board) c. Martin 7 .\n[14] Pour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, nous nous attarderons plus particuli\u00e8rement aux deux derniers arr\u00eats soit les arr\u00eats Cooper et Martin.\n[15] Dans son argumentation, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a beaucoup insist\u00e9 sur le fait que le Tribunal, selon l'alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) et le paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi, ne peut \u00eatre saisi d'une plainte que suite \u00e0 une demande formul\u00e9e par la Commission. Il en conclut que la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est, dans ce contexte, tributaire de celle de la Commission. En d'autres mots, si la Commission n'a pas la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher une question, alors le Tribunal ne peut, non plus, avoir cette comp\u00e9tence.\n[16] Afin d'appuyer cet argument, l'intim\u00e9e s'appuie sur deux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec soit l'arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse 8 et l'arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. Tribunal des droits de la personne 9 .\n[17] Dans le premier arr\u00eat, l'intim\u00e9e fait surtout r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux propos de la juge Rousseau-Houle qui, s'exprimant au nom de la majorit\u00e9, indique que La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est tributaire de sa saisine par la Commission. [] 10 et du juge Robert qui, en dissidence, mentionne Tel que nous l'avons vu plus t\u00f4t, le Tribunal est tributaire de sa saisine par la Commission. 11\n[18] Se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant ensuite \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. Tribunal des droits de la personne, l'intim\u00e9e fait mention du passage suivant de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec:\nToutes les parties devant la Cour reconnaissent, \u00e0 bon droit, que la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est ici tributaire de sa saisine par la Commission. La comp\u00e9tence de la Commission pour pr\u00e9senter la demande dont il s'agit dans ce pourvoi d\u00e9termine la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour en \u00eatre saisi. []12\n[19] Pour bien comprendre ces tr\u00e8s courts extraits de ces d\u00e9cisions, il nous faut pousser un peu plus loin notre analyse de celles-ci. Premi\u00e8rement, rappelons que la question en litige dans la d\u00e9cision Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse \u00e9tait la suivante: le principe bien \u00e9tabli au Qu\u00e9bec de l'exclusivit\u00e9 arbitrale doit-il c\u00e9der le pas au d\u00e9veloppement d'une th\u00e9orie favorisant une exclusivit\u00e9 ou encore une concurrence des comp\u00e9tences entre l'arbitre des griefs et le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la province de Qu\u00e9bec parce que le litige soul\u00e8ve une question des droits de la personne ? 13 Une question qui porte essentiellement sur la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence exclusive de l'arbitre des griefs; question qui est bien diff\u00e9rente de celle dont nous sommes saisis en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, aucune des parties ne questionne le fait que la Commission \u00e9tait pleinement comp\u00e9tente de se saisir de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante et personne ne conteste la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne d'\u00eatre saisi de cette plainte. La question en litige porte sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de trancher une question portant sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d'une disposition de la Loi.\n[20] Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que la juge Rousseau-Houle est consciente de la distinction qui existe entre la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la loi provinciale sur la question de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive de l'arbitre des griefs. Elle constate \u00e0 cet effet:\nCertaines lois canadiennes portant sur les droits de la personne contiennent des dispositions dont le but est d'\u00e9carter la possibilit\u00e9 que les plaintes de ceux qui sont l\u00e9s\u00e9s soient simultan\u00e9ment ou successivement d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es aux organismes charg\u00e9s de l'application de ces lois et \u00e0 des arbitres de griefs. Ainsi, l'article 41 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne de m\u00eame que l'article 34(1) du Human Rights Code de l'Ontario habilitent la Commission des droits de la personne \u00e0 ne pas donner suite \u00e0 une plainte si elle estime que son auteur dispose d'un autre recours appropri\u00e9 incluant la proc\u00e9dure de griefs. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, on note que, dans l'arr\u00eat Cooper c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne portant sur la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne d'examiner la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de sa loi habilitante, les pilotes de ligne qui devaient \u00eatre mis \u00e0 la retraite \u00e0 60 ans conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective se sont adress\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits et non \u00e0 l'arbitre des griefs parce que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne le permettait.14\n[21] Ainsi, si la m\u00eame question s'\u00e9tait pos\u00e9e au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, tout semble indiquer que la d\u00e9cision aurait pu \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente.\n[22] Un peu plus loin parlant de la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec 15 , elle ajoute:\nEn droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, les dispositions de la charte attributives de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal ne permettent pas, \u00e0 mon avis, d'\u00e9carter la comp\u00e9tence exclusive de l'arbitre des griefs lorsque le litige dans son contexte factuel, r\u00e9sulte express\u00e9ment ou implicitement de la convention collective.16\n[23] Face \u00e0 la juridiction exclusive de l'arbitre des griefs, la Commission qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise ne pouvait donc porter sa demande devant le Tribunal des droits de la personne et celui-ci aurait d\u00fb d\u00e9clarer qu'il n'avait pas comp\u00e9tence ratione materiae.17\n[24] Consid\u00e9rant la situation particuli\u00e8re soulev\u00e9e dans cette affaire, je ne vois pas en quoi celle-ci peut \u00eatre pertinente dans la d\u00e9termination de la question dont nous sommes saisis en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans le contexte qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, le l\u00e9gislateur a explicitement permis que les recours pour assurer le respect des droits garantis par la charte qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise soient exerc\u00e9s devant d'autres forums que le Tribunal. En cons\u00e9quence, la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec a conclu que le principe de l'exclusivit\u00e9 arbitrale doit pr\u00e9dominer puisque le litige d\u00e9coulait essentiellement de l'application de la convention collective et que le r\u00e9gime du Code du travail est apte \u00e0 r\u00e9gir tous les aspects des rapports entre les parties dans le cadre des relations du travail.18\n[25] Dans l'arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. Tribunal des droits de la personne, les questions que la Cour devait d\u00e9cider portaient sur le pouvoir de la Commission qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des droits de la personne de pr\u00e9senter une demande touchant la validit\u00e9 ou l'opposabilit\u00e9 d'une disposition l\u00e9gislative par rapport \u00e0 la charte qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des droits de la personne et quant \u00e0 la juridiction du Tribunal qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois des droits de la personne d'en d\u00e9cider.\n[26] Apr\u00e8s une lecture attentive de cette d\u00e9cision, je constate que sous plusieurs \u00e9gards elle ne favorise pas n\u00e9cessairement la th\u00e8se de l'intim\u00e9e. J'en prends pour exemple, entre autres, le passage suivant de la d\u00e9cision :\nLes arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada enseignent qu'il faut rechercher l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur pour d\u00e9terminer si le tribunal administratif a comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur des questions de droit en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ce qui implique le pouvoir de se prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle d'une disposition l\u00e9gislative. L'analyse doit d\u00e9passer la simple recherche d'un texte accordant express\u00e9ment un pouvoir donn\u00e9. En l'absence d'une disposition explicite privant un tribunal d'un pouvoir, il faut interpr\u00e9ter sa loi habilitante de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 donner \u00e0 cet organisme, que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu efficace, les pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'accomplissement de sa mission. Dans Dunedin, traitant du pouvoir du juge de paix saisi d'un litige fond\u00e9 sur la Loi sur les infractions provinciales, la juge en chef de la Cour supr\u00eame semble m\u00eame faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les tribunaux d'une pr\u00e9somption de comp\u00e9tence lorsque aucun texte ne l'exclut\nL'approche fonctionnelle et structurelle permet de r\u00e9aliser cet \u00e9quilibre entre l'acc\u00e8s concret aux r\u00e9parations pr\u00e9vues par la Charte et la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers le r\u00f4le des l\u00e9gislatures. Elle repose sur la th\u00e9orie selon laquelle, lorsqu'un l\u00e9gislateur confie \u00e0 un tribunal judiciaire ou administratif une fonction l'amenant \u00e0 trancher des questions susceptibles de toucher des droits garantis par la Charte et le dote de m\u00e9canismes et proc\u00e9dures lui permettant de d\u00e9cider de fa\u00e7on juste et \u00e9quitable ces questions accessoires li\u00e9es \u00e0 la Charte, il faut alors en d\u00e9duire, en l'absence d'intention contraire, que le l\u00e9gislateur entendait habiliter ce tribunal \u00e0 appliquer la Charte.19\n[27] Le passage de l'arr\u00eat Dunedin, cit\u00e9 par la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec, s'applique d'autant plus au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personnes puisqu'il existe, comme nous le verrons plus loin, dans la Loi une disposition expresse lui confiant le pouvoir de trancher des questions de droit et qu'il est dot\u00e9 de m\u00e9canismes et proc\u00e9dures lui permettant de d\u00e9cider de fa\u00e7on juste et \u00e9quitable ces questions.\n[28] Comme la procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Qu\u00e9bec dans l'affaire Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse, l'intim\u00e9e, en l'esp\u00e8ce, a beaucoup insist\u00e9 sur l'effet, selon elle, d\u00e9terminant de l'arr\u00eat Cooper. L'intim\u00e9e en tire la conclusion que la Commission n'a pas le pouvoir de juger qu'une disposition de la Loi, dont elle doit par ailleurs assurer le respect et la mise en application, est invalide et, qu'en cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal n'a pas non plus le pouvoir d'invalider une disposition de la Loi. L'intim\u00e9e reprend, \u00e0 ce titre, les propos du juge La Forest dans Cooper afin d'appuyer sa conclusion :\nIl d\u00e9coule logiquement de ma conclusion selon laquelle la Commission n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de sa loi habilitante, qu'un tribunal constitu\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi et, en fait, un tribunal d'appel form\u00e9 en vertu de l'art. 56 sont \u00e9galement d\u00e9pourvus de la comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9clarer inconstitutionnelle une disposition limitative de la Loi. Prenons l'exemple de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce: si la Commission doit appliquer la Loi telle qu'elle est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e, la plainte des appelants ne pourra \u00eatre d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 un tribunal, puisqu'il faudrait pour cela que l'al. 15c) soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inop\u00e9rant. Il en irait de m\u00eame de toute plainte qui n\u00e9cessiterait que la Commission tranche une question constitutionnelle avant de pouvoir conclure qu'il est justifi\u00e9 de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte \u00e0 un tribunal pour qu'il en fasse enqu\u00eate. Il serait quelque peu paradoxal que le l\u00e9gislateur conf\u00e8re aux tribunaux constitu\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi une comp\u00e9tence qu'ils ne pourraient jamais exercer.20\n[29] Toutefois, je suis d'avis que cet arr\u00eat, dans le contexte l\u00e9gislatif actuel et selon l'\u00e9tat de la jurisprudence r\u00e9cente de la Cour supr\u00eame, n'appuie pas les pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9e. D'ailleurs, pour bien comprendre ce passage de Cooper, il faut \u00e9galement faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux paragraphes qui suivent o\u00f9 le juge La Forest ajoute:\n64 Comme pour la Commission, la Loi [telle qu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque] ne conf\u00e8re pas express\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces tribunaux le pouvoir d'examiner des questions de droit. Pris ensemble, les par.50(1) et 53(2) de la Loi disposent qu'un tribunal examine l'objet de la plainte qui lui est d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Commission pour d\u00e9terminer si elle est fond\u00e9e. Il s'agit d'abord et avant tout d'une enqu\u00eate portant sur l'appr\u00e9ciation des faits, qui vise \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si oui ou non un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. Au cours d'une telle enqu\u00eate, un tribunal peut effectivement examiner des questions de droit. Comme dans le cas de la Commission, ces questions porteront souvent essentiellement sur l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner \u00e0 la loi habilitante. Cependant, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui en est pour la Commission, l'\u00e9conomie de la loi pose implicitement qu'un tribunal poss\u00e8de une comp\u00e9tence plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de statuer sur les questions de droit. Ainsi, on a reconnu aux tribunaux administratifs le pouvoir d'interpr\u00e9ter d'autres lois que leur loi habilitante (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Druken, [1989] 2 C.F. 24 (C.A.)) et d'examiner des questions constitutionnelles autres que celles mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus. En particulier, il est bien \u00e9tabli qu'un tribunal administratif a le pouvoir d'examiner des questions portant sur le partage des comp\u00e9tences constitutionnelles (Public Service Alliance of Canada c. Qu'Appelle Indian Residential Council (1986), 7 C.H.R.R. D\/3600 (T.C.D.P.)), et sur la validit\u00e9 d'un motif de discrimination vis\u00e9 dans la Loi (Nealy c. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450 (T.C.D.P.)), et on peut envisager qu'un tribunal puisse entendre une argumentation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte quant \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des recours disponibles dans une affaire donn\u00e9e (voir Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892). Cependant, m\u00eame dans ce cas, la r\u00e8gle de la retenue judiciaire ne s'appliquera pas aux conclusions juridiques formul\u00e9es. C'est ce que notre Cour a fermement \u00e9tabli dans Mossop, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la p.585:\nL'expertise sup\u00e9rieure d'un tribunal des droits de la personne porte sur l'appr\u00e9ciation des faits et sur les d\u00e9cisions dans un contexte de droits de la personne. Cette expertise ne s'\u00e9tend pas aux questions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de droit comme celle qui est soulev\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce. Ces questions rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence des cours de justice et font appel \u00e0 des concepts d'interpr\u00e9tation des lois et \u00e0 un raisonnement juridique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, qui sont cens\u00e9s relever de la comp\u00e9tence des cours de justice.\n65 J'ajouterais une mise en garde pratique en ce qui concerne le pouvoir d'un tribunal des droits de la personne d'examiner des arguments fond\u00e9s sur la Charte. Premi\u00e8rement, comme il en a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e9tat, un tel tribunal ne dispose pas toujours d'une expertise particuli\u00e8re, exception faite du domaine de l'appr\u00e9ciation des faits dans un contexte de droits de la personne. Deuxi\u00e8mement, les gains en efficacit\u00e9 que semble \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue procurer la voie permettant d'\u00e9viter le syst\u00e8me judiciaire disparaissent lorsque les in\u00e9vitables demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Troisi\u00e8mement, si la capacit\u00e9 absolue de recevoir toute preuve jug\u00e9e utile peut convenir pour trancher une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, elle n'est pas appropri\u00e9e lorsqu'il s'agit de se prononcer sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d'une disposition l\u00e9gislative. Enfin, la raison peut-\u00eatre la plus d\u00e9terminante est que la complexit\u00e9, les co\u00fbts et les d\u00e9lais accrus qui d\u00e9couleraient de la possibilit\u00e9 pour les tribunaux des droits de la personne d'entendre des questions constitutionnelles mineraient, dans une large mesure, l'objectif principal poursuivi par la cr\u00e9ation de ces tribunaux, savoir le traitement efficace et diligent des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n66 Compte tenu de tous ces facteurs, j'estime que, bien qu'il puisse avoir la comp\u00e9tence d'examiner des questions de droit et des questions constitutionnelles d'ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, un tribunal des droits de la personne ne peut logiquement avoir la comp\u00e9tence qui lui permettrait de mettre en cause la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d'une disposition limitative de la Loi. (C'est moi qui souligne.)\n[30] Dans Cooper, la Cour s'appuyait, dans sa conclusion que le Tribunal ne pouvait trancher une question portant sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d'une disposition de sa loi habilitante, sur le fait que la Loi en vigueur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque ne conf\u00e9rait pas express\u00e9ment au Tribunal le pouvoir d'examiner et de trancher des questions de droit. Elle reconnaissait toutefois que l'\u00e9conomie de la Loi permettait implicitement au Tribunal de statuer sur des questions de droit et des questions constitutionnelles d'ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Dans l'arr\u00eat Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Workers' Compensation Board) c. Martin, une Cour supr\u00eame unanime rejettera cette distinction entre les questions de droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et les questions de droit limit\u00e9es.21\n[31] Quoi qu'il en soit, et en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour l'opinion de la majorit\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Cooper, je me dois aujourd'hui de porter mon attention sur le nouveau contexte l\u00e9gislatif et sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Martin qui propose une nouvelle approche pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question qui nous est pos\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[32] Avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'analyse de la d\u00e9cision dans l'arr\u00eat Martin, je me dois de clarifier une certaine confusion qui semble exister quant aux r\u00f4les respectifs de la Commission et du Tribunal. Dans son argument l'intim\u00e9e mentionne que la Commission est un organisme aux fonctions essentiellement administratives et qu'elle est notamment charg\u00e9e d'assurer la mise en application et le respect de la Loi. Elle s'appuie \u00e0 cet effet sur les propos du juge La Forest qui dans l'affaire Cooper 22 , indique que :\nLa Commission n'est pas un organisme d\u00e9cisionnel; cette fonction est remplie par les tribunaux constitu\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi. Lorsqu'elle d\u00e9termine si une plainte devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 un tribunal, la Commission proc\u00e8de \u00e0 un examen pr\u00e9alable assez semblable \u00e0 celui qu'un juge effectue \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. Il ne lui appartient pas de juger si la plainte est fond\u00e9e. Son r\u00f4le consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si, aux termes des dispositions de la Loi et eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'ensemble des faits, il est justifi\u00e9 de tenir une enqu\u00eate. L'aspect principal de ce r\u00f4le est alors de v\u00e9rifier s'il existe une preuve suffisante. Le juge Sopinka a soulign\u00e9 ce point dans Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de production du Qu\u00e9bec et de l'Acadie c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1989] 2 R.C.S. 879, \u00e0 la page 899.\n[33] Si c'est l\u00e0 le r\u00f4le et les fonctions de la Commission, ceux du Tribunal sont diff\u00e9rents.\n[34] Sans vouloir entrer dans les d\u00e9tails du r\u00f4le de ces deux organismes, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que dans l'arr\u00eat Bell Canada c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone 23 la Cour supr\u00eame a bien r\u00e9sum\u00e9 le r\u00f4le et la nature du Tribunal :\n23 La principale fonction du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne est de nature juridictionnelle. Il tient des audiences formelles sur les plaintes dont il est saisi par la Commission. Il d\u00e9tient plusieurs des pouvoirs d'une cour de justice. Il est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 statuer sur des faits, \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter et \u00e0 appliquer le droit aux faits qui lui sont soumis et \u00e0 accorder les redressements appropri\u00e9s. De plus, ses audiences sont structur\u00e9es sensiblement de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'un proc\u00e8s formel devant une cour de justice. Les parties en pr\u00e9sence devant le tribunal pr\u00e9sentent une preuve, font entendre et contre-interrogent des t\u00e9moins, et pr\u00e9sentent des observations sur l'application du droit aux faits. Le Tribunal ne participe pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration des politiques et ne m\u00e8ne pas ses propres enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendants sur les plaintes: le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment attribu\u00e9 les fonctions d'enqu\u00eate et d'\u00e9laboration de politique \u00e0 un organisme diff\u00e9rent, soit la Commission. []\n26[] Le Tribunal fait partie d'un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif visant \u00e0 identifier les pratiques discriminatoires et \u00e0 y rem\u00e9dier. \u00c0 ce titre, l'objectif plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui sous-tend sa fonction juridictionnelle consiste \u00e0 veiller \u00e0 la mise en oeuvre de la politique gouvernementale en mati\u00e8re de discrimination. Il est crucial pour atteindre cet objectif plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, que toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 dans la Loi soit interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par le Tribunal d'une mani\u00e8re qui favorise plut\u00f4t que de contrecarrer la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs de la Loi. (C'est moi qui souligne)\n[35] Le Tribunal est donc un organisme de nature juridictionnelle dont la fonction principale est de d\u00e9cider des plaintes dont la Commission le saisit et d'interpr\u00e9ter la Loi de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 en r\u00e9aliser les objectifs.\n[36] Ce dont la Commission saisit le Tribunal ce sont des plaintes. En l'esp\u00e8ce, toutes les parties, y inclus l'intim\u00e9e, s'entendent pour dire que le Tribunal a bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'une plainte par la Commission.\n[37] Il est \u00e9vident \u00e0 la lecture de la lettre de la pr\u00e9sidente de la Commission \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal que tous les aspects de la plainte, tels que pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le formulaire de plainte sign\u00e9 par la plaignante en 2001, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9s au Tribunal. En outre, comme le souligne si bien mon coll\u00e8gue, le membre instructeur Hadjis, dans C\u00f4t\u00e9 c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada il ne faut pas perdre de vue le fait que, m\u00eame si la Commission est habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si une plainte doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal (par. 44(3) et art. 49 de la Loi), la plainte demeure celle de la plaignante et non celle de la Commission . 24\n[38] Une fois saisi d'une plainte, le Tribunal, selon le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi, paragraphe qui n'existait pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la d\u00e9cision dans l'arr\u00eat Cooper, tranche les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie. . La version anglaise du paragraphe nous appara\u00eet d'ailleurs plus clair : the member or panel may decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter. (C'est moi qui souligne.) Le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, connaissant les conclusions de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Cooper, a clairement choisi en adoptant cette disposition en 1998, d'\u00e9largir la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Cette d\u00e9cision est d'ailleurs conforme au principe de la supr\u00e9matie de la Constitution que nous retrouvons \u00e0 l'article 52 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 et \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui veut que le tribunal administratif \u00e0 qui l'on a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 le pouvoir d'interpr\u00e9ter la loi a aussi le pouvoir concomitant de d\u00e9terminer si la loi est constitutionnelle 25 ou, dans les mots de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Cooper si un tribunal administratif jouit du pouvoir d'examiner des questions de droit, il s'ensuit, par application du par. 52(1) [Loi constitutionnelle de 1982], qu'il peut se prononcer sur des questions constitutionnelles, dont celle de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de sa loi habilitante 26 ; conclusion qui sera confirm\u00e9e \u00e0 nouveau dans l'arr\u00eat Bell :\n[]Le pouvoir de tranche[r] les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi , conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal par le par. 50(2) de la Loi, est manifestement un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'examiner des questions de droit, notamment des questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte et \u00e0 la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits. 27\n[39] Dans les arr\u00eats Douglas College, Cuddy Chicks et T\u00e9treault-Gadoury, la Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 cette question et dans chaque cas, elle a fait ressortir les raisons s\u00e9rieuses, tant sur le plan des principes que sur celui de la politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, qui justifient d'accorder un tel pouvoir aux tribunaux administratifs; raisons que nous trouverons clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 28 \u00e0 32 de la d\u00e9cision dans l'arr\u00eat Martin.\n[40] Le Tribunal ayant le pouvoir, en vertu du paragraphe 50(2), de trancher toute question de droit, est, dans les mots de la Cour supr\u00eame, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir le pouvoir concomitant d'examiner et de trancher des questions \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la Charte, \u00e0 moins que le l\u00e9gislateur lui ait retir\u00e9 ce pouvoir. Ainsi, le tribunal administratif investi du pouvoir de trancher les questions de droit d\u00e9coulant de l'application d'une disposition l\u00e9gislative particuli\u00e8re sera pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir le pouvoir de se prononcer sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de cette disposition. En d'autres termes, le pouvoir de trancher une question de droit s'entend du pouvoir de la trancher en n'appliquant que des r\u00e8gles de droit valides.28 (C'est moi qui souligne.) Ou encore, dans les mots de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Bell : Aucune loi invalide ne lie le Tribunal. 29\n[41] Dans l'arr\u00eat Paul c. Colombie Britannnique (Forest Appeals Commission)30 , la Cour supr\u00eame avait \u00e0 trancher la question \u00e0 savoir si une province pouvait habiliter une commission \u00e0 entendre et \u00e0 trancher des questions relatives \u00e0 l'article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 relativement \u00e0 un droit ancestral reconnu. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question la Cour supr\u00eame avait ceci \u00e0 dire:\n\u00c0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire, je souligne que rien ne justifie d'exiger une attribution expresse de comp\u00e9tence pour qu'un tribunal administratif soit capable d'appliquer l'art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Il n'y a aucune raison s\u00e9rieuse de distinguer le pouvoir de trancher des questions relatives \u00e0 l'art. 35 de celui de se prononcer sur d'autres questions de droit constitutionnel - comme le partage des comp\u00e9tences \u00e9tabli par la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867- ou sur un droit garanti par la Charte. L'article 35 n'est pas plus que la Charte un texte sacr\u00e9 que seuls les initi\u00e9s des cours sup\u00e9rieures peuvent aborder (Cooper, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 70, la juge McLachlin(maintenant Juge en chef), dissidente). [] Les arguments voulant que les droits garantis par l'art. 35 soient qualitativement diff\u00e9rents - qu'ils soient plus complexes et exigent une plus grande expertise relativement \u00e0 la preuve produite - sont peu fond\u00e9s. Comme le fait observer le juge Moen dans la d\u00e9cision Ermineskin Cree Nation c. Canada (2001), 297 A.R. 226, 2001 ABQB 760, par 51, en d\u00e9cidant qu'un tribunal des droits de la personne \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent pour examiner un argument fond\u00e9 sur l'art. 35 :\n[TRADUCTION] [I]l n'y a aucune raison fond\u00e9e sur des principes de distinguer les questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte de celles relatives \u00e0 l'art. 35, dans le contexte du pouvoir du tribunal d'examiner des questions de droit constitutionnel. Dans les deux cas, l'instance d\u00e9cisionnelle ne fait qu'appliquer les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la jurisprudence pour d\u00e9terminer si un droit revendiqu\u00e9 est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la Constitution. Dans les deux cas, si le demandeur a gain de cause, il s'ensuit une d\u00e9claration d'invalidit\u00e9 ou un refus d'appliquer seulement la loi ou la disposition en cause devant l'instance d\u00e9cisionnelle.31 (C'est moi qui souligne)\n[42] Ces propos s'appliquent \u00e9galement en l'esp\u00e8ce. Fait \u00e0 remarquer, la cour de premi\u00e8re instance de l'Alberta \u00e9tait justement appel\u00e9e, dans l'arr\u00eat Ermineskin Cree Nation c. Canada, cit\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Paul, \u00e0 se prononcer sur le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l'arr\u00eat Cooper et elle a conclu que le pouvoir de trancher des questions de droit conf\u00e9rait au Tribunal le pouvoir de disposer de questions d'ordre constitutionnel.\n[43] Dans sa r\u00e9cente d\u00e9cision dans l'arr\u00eat Martin, la Cour supr\u00eame a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la nouvelle approche pour d\u00e9terminer si un tribunal, comme le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, peut soumettre des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. Cette approche peut se r\u00e9sumer comme suit :\nLe tribunal administratif a-t-il express\u00e9ment ou implicitement comp\u00e9tence pour trancher les questions de droit d\u00e9coulant de l'application de la disposition contest\u00e9e. a)La comp\u00e9tence expresse est celle exprim\u00e9e dans le libell\u00e9 de la disposition habilitante. b) La comp\u00e9tence implicite ressort de l'examen de la loi dans son ensemble. Les facteurs pertinents sont notamment les suivants: la mission que la loi confie au tribunal administratif en cause et la question de savoir s'il est n\u00e9cessaire de trancher des questions de droit pour accomplir efficacement cette mission; l'interaction entre ce tribunal et les autres composantes du r\u00e9gime administratif; la question de savoir si le tribunal est une instance juridictionnelle, des consid\u00e9rations pratiques telle la capacit\u00e9 du tribunal d'examiner des questions de droit. Les consid\u00e9rations pratiques ne sauraient toutefois l'emporter sur ce qui ressort clairement de la Loi elle-m\u00eame. S'il est jug\u00e9 que le tribunal a le pouvoir de trancher les questions de droit d\u00e9coulant de l'application d'une disposition l\u00e9gislative, ce pouvoir sera pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 inclure celui de se prononcer sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de cette disposition au regard de la Charte. La partie qui pr\u00e9tend que le tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour appliquer la Charte peut r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption a) en signalant que le pouvoir d'examiner la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 express\u00e9ment, ou b) en convainquant le Tribunal qu'un examen du r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par la loi m\u00e8ne clairement \u00e0 la conclusion que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu exclure la Charte des questions de droits soumises \u00e0 l'examen du tribunal. Une telle inf\u00e9rence doit \u00e9maner de la loi elle-m\u00eame et non de consid\u00e9rations externes.32\n[44] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est pr\u00e9vue de mani\u00e8re expresse au paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi. Dans les mots du juge Gonthier dans l'arr\u00eat Martin s'il est investi du pouvoir d'examiner les questions de droit li\u00e9es \u00e0 une disposition, ce pouvoir englobe habituellement celui d'\u00e9valuer la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de cette dispositionla compatibilit\u00e9 d'une disposition avec la Constitution est une question de droit d\u00e9coulant de l'application de cette disposition.33 Puisque le Tribunal a le pouvoir de trancher les questions de droit d\u00e9coulant de l'application d'une disposition l\u00e9gislative, ce pouvoir est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 inclure celui de se prononcer sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de cette disposition au regard de la Charte.\n[45] Il est vrai que dans l'arr\u00eat Martin, le juge Gonthier a mentionn\u00e9 :\n\u00c0 mon avis, les nouvelles r\u00e8gles actuellement en vigueur auraient permis d'arriver au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat que dans l'arr\u00eat Cooper, compte tenu de la conclusion du juge La Forest que la commission n'avait aucun pouvoir expr\u00e8s ou implicite de trancher les questions de droit d\u00e9coulant de l'application de l'al. 15c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il est donc inutile, pour le moment, de revoir la d\u00e9cision rendue dans cette affaire [] 34\n[46] Ainsi, la question \u00e0 savoir si la Commission poss\u00e8de dans le nouveau cadre l\u00e9gislatif un tel pouvoir demeure enti\u00e8re. Toutefois, cette question n'a pas besoin d'\u00eatre r\u00e9pondue dans la pr\u00e9sente instance puisqu'il est clair que le l\u00e9gislateur a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on expresse ce pouvoir au Tribunal.\n[47] L'honorable juge Gonthier ajoute:\nJ'estime cependant que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est incompatible avec les pr\u00e9sents motifs, le raisonnement des juges majoritaires dans l'arr\u00eat Cooper n'est plus valable. Cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai dans la mesure o\u00f9 il laisse entendre que la distinction entre les questions de droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et les questions de droit limit\u00e9es est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement utile pour analyser le pouvoir d'un tribunal administratif d'appliquer la Charte, ou que la nature juridictionnelle de l'organisme administratif est un facteur n\u00e9cessaire (voir pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant) dans la recherche d'un pouvoir implicite. De m\u00eame, les opinions exprim\u00e9es par le juge en chef Lamer dans ses motifs concourants vont \u00e0 l'encontre de l'approche actuelle et ne sauraient \u00eatre invoques.35\n[48] En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d'avis que depuis l'adoption des modifications \u00e0 la Loi en 1998, la conclusion des juges majoritaires dans l'arr\u00eat Cooper n'est plus, du moins en ce qui concerne le Tribunal, compatible avec les motifs de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Martin.\n[49] Le pouvoir de trancher des questions de droit ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 express\u00e9ment au Tribunal, il revient maintenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, selon l'approche dans l'arr\u00eat Martin, de r\u00e9futer cette pr\u00e9somption en signalant soit que le pouvoir d'examiner la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 express\u00e9ment, ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce, ou en convainquant le Tribunal qu'un examen du r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par la Loi m\u00e8ne clairement \u00e0 la conclusion que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu exclure la Charte des questions de droits soumises \u00e0 l'examen du Tribunal. Une telle inf\u00e9rence doit \u00e9maner de la Loi elle-m\u00eame et non de consid\u00e9rations externes.\n[50] Consid\u00e9rant la nature quasi-constitutionnelle de la Loi et l'objet de celle-ci qui est d'identifier les pratiques discriminatoires et d'y rem\u00e9dier, il est crucial que la Loi soit interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par le Tribunal d'une mani\u00e8re qui favorise plut\u00f4t que de contrecarrer la r\u00e9alisation de ses objectifs.36 La Loi t\u00e9moigne de l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur d'\u00e9tablir un Tribunal qui fonctionne selon un processus quasi-judiciaire et dont les fonctions permettront que celle-ci soit interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re non discriminatoire.\n[51] En raison de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je ne suis pas convaincu que l'intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 rencontrer le fardeau qui est le sien et \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'un examen du r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par la Loi m\u00e8ne clairement \u00e0 la conclusion que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu exclure la Charte des questions de droits soumises \u00e0 l'examen du Tribunal ou encore qu'il ait voulu exclure les questions portant sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des dispositions de la loi habilitante.\n[52] L'argument que cette volont\u00e9 d'exclure la possibilit\u00e9 de trancher les questions portant sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d'une disposition de la loi habilitante d\u00e9coule du paragraphe 49(5)37 de la Loi ne m'aura \u00e9galement pas convaincu. Il est clair, \u00e0 la lecture du paragraphe 49(6)38 , que le paragraphe 49(5) n'a qu'un effet proc\u00e9dural et que sa non observation n'entra\u00eene aucunement la nullit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures.\nV. CONCLUSION [53] Pour les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je suis d'avis de rejeter l'objection pr\u00e9liminaire de l'intim\u00e9e. Mes conclusions signifient que le Tribunal est comp\u00e9tent pour poursuivre l'instruction de tous les aspects de l'affaire, y inclus la question quant \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c), de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\nsign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 9 d\u00e9cembre 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE PARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T785\/3503\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Francine Laurendeau c.

Jain, professeur \u00e9m\u00e9rite en ressources humaines et relations de travail \u00e0 la MDG School of Business de l'Universit\u00e9 McMaster. La partie plaignante propose de reconna\u00eetre le professeur Jain comme [TRADUCTION] un sp\u00e9cialiste en mati\u00e8re de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, de discrimination au sens large et de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s raciaux en milieu de travail, du point de vue des sciences sociales.\n[2] La partie intim\u00e9e s'oppose \u00e0 ce que le professeur Jain soit reconnu comme expert aux fins de cette preuve d'expert.

La pertinence est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le juge comme question de droit. Bien que la preuve soit admissible \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue si elle est \u00e0 ce point li\u00e9e au fait concern\u00e9 qu'elle tend \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablir, l'analyse ne se termine pas l\u00e0. Cela \u00e9tablit seulement la pertinence logique de la preuve. D'autres consid\u00e9rations influent \u00e9galement sur la d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 l'admissibilit\u00e9. Cet examen suppl\u00e9mentaire peut \u00eatre d\u00e9crit comme une analyse du co\u00fbt et des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices, \u00e0 savoir si la valeur en vaut le co\u00fbt. Voir McCormick on Evidence (3e \u00e9d. 1984), \u00e0 la p. 544. Le co\u00fbt dans ce contexte n'est pas utilis\u00e9 dans le sens \u00e9conomique traditionnel du terme, mais plut\u00f4t par rapport \u00e0 son impact sur le proc\u00e8s. La preuve qui est par ailleurs logiquement pertinente peut \u00eatre exclue sur ce fondement si sa valeur probante est surpass\u00e9e par son effet pr\u00e9judiciable, si elle exige un temps excessivement long qui est sans commune mesure avec sa valeur ou si elle peut induire en erreur en ce sens que son effet sur le juge des faits, en particulier le jury, est disproportionn\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 sa fiabilit\u00e9.\n[7] \u00c0 propos de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, la Cour, dans Mohan, cite (au paragraphe 21) un extrait d'un arr\u00eat ant\u00e9rieur - R. c. Abbey, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 24 :\nQuant aux questions qui exigent des connaissances particuli\u00e8res, un expert dans le domaine peut tirer des conclusions et exprimer son avis. Le r\u00f4le d'un expert est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de fournir au juge et au jury une conclusion toute faite que ces derniers, en raison de la technicit\u00e9 des faits, sont incapables de formuler. [TRADUCTION] L'opinion d'un expert est recevable pour donner \u00e0 la cour des renseignements scientifiques qui, selon toute vraisemblance, d\u00e9passent l'exp\u00e9rience et la connaissance d'un juge ou d'un jury. Si, \u00e0 partir des faits \u00e9tablis par la preuve, un juge ou un jury peut \u00e0 lui seul tirer ses propres conclusions, alors l'opinion de l'expert n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire (Turner (1974), 60 Crim. App. R. 80, \u00e0 la p. 83, le lord juge Lawton).\n[8] La Cour supr\u00eame, dans Mohan, ajoute ce qui suit (paragraphe 22) :\nCette condition pr\u00e9alable est fr\u00e9quemment reprise dans la question de savoir si la preuve serait utile au juge des faits. Le mot utile n'est pas tout \u00e0 fait juste car il \u00e9tablit un seuil trop bas. Toutefois, je ne jugerais pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 selon une norme trop stricte. L'exigence est que l'opinion soit n\u00e9cessaire au sens qu'elle fournit des renseignements qui, selon toute vraisemblance, d\u00e9passent l'exp\u00e9rience et la connaissance d'un juge ou d'un jury : cit\u00e9 par le juge Dickson, dans Abbey, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. Comme le juge Dickson l'a dit, la preuve doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre au juge des faits d'appr\u00e9cier les questions en litige \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 leur nature technique.\n[c'est nous qui soulignons]\n[9] La preuve qu'entend pr\u00e9senter le professeur Jain comporte essentiellement deux volets, selon son rapport. Le premier volet prend la forme d'un expos\u00e9 d\u00e9crivant certaines des causes de la discrimination raciale en milieu de travail. Cet aspect de la preuve ne comporte aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence explicite \u00e0 la GRC ou aux faits particuliers all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte.\n[10] Le deuxi\u00e8me volet de la preuve d'expert propos\u00e9e se veut une [TRADUCTION] analyse quantitative de la port\u00e9e, de la nature et des tendances de la discrimination raciale dans l'emploi au Canada au cours des deux derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies. Cette analyse repose sur un \u00e9chantillon de 119 d\u00e9cisions publi\u00e9es dans le Canadian Human Rights Reporter entre 1980 et 1999. L'analyse en question est suivie d'une analyse qualitative, fond\u00e9e sur un certain nombre d'affaires, des [TRADUCTION] sch\u00e8mes de comportement et des conditions d'emploi qui peuvent entra\u00eener un traitement discriminatoire des minorit\u00e9s raciales en milieu de travail, analyse que le t\u00e9moin qualifie d'illustrative. Ces analyses sont parfois entrecoup\u00e9es d'observations du professeur Jain selon lesquelles, \u00e0 son avis, un grand nombre des incidents dont il est fait \u00e9tat dans la plainte sont le reflet de certaines des tendances de discrimination dont atteste la jurisprudence canadienne relative aux droits de la personne.\n[11] \u00c0 mon avis, le premier volet de la preuve que le professeur Jain entend pr\u00e9senter a une valeur probatoire minimale en l'esp\u00e8ce. Bien que les connaissances des causes profondes du racisme au travail soient cruciales du point de vue de la qu\u00eate incessante de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour enrayer toutes les formes de discrimination, je ne vois pas comment une preuve g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 ce sujet pourra aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 comportement discriminatoire d\u00e9crit dans la plainte s'est bel et bien produit. Le temps qui sera consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audition de cette preuve sera sans commune mesure avec sa valeur probatoire.\n[12] En ce qui concerne le deuxi\u00e8me aspect de la preuve propos\u00e9e, il ne fait aucun doute \u00e0 mon avis qu'une revue de la jurisprudence pertinente dans le domaine de la discrimination raciale m'aidera \u00e0 tirer mes conclusions et \u00e0 rendre ma d\u00e9cision, une fois que l'ensemble de la preuve aura \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la partie plaignante et la partie intim\u00e9e. Je compte pleinement sur les avocats savants et comp\u00e9tents qui repr\u00e9sentent chaque partie pour me signaler toute la jurisprudence pertinente et les autres sources faisant autorit\u00e9 et pour porter \u00e0 ma connaissance des faits analogues sur lesquels je serai pri\u00e9 de me fonder pour parvenir \u00e0 des conclusions similaires. Ce genre d'analyse fait certes partie des attributions du Tribunal. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a fait remarquer \u00e0 plusieurs occasions que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne poss\u00e8de une expertise sup\u00e9rieure en ce qui concerne l'appr\u00e9ciation des faits et les d\u00e9cisions dans un contexte de droits de la personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que le deuxi\u00e8me volet de la preuve propos\u00e9e d\u00e9passe le champ d'exp\u00e9rience et de connaissances du Tribunal. La condition de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans Mohan n'est pas satisfaite.\n[13] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, l'objection de la partie intim\u00e9e est accueillie et la preuve qu'entendait pr\u00e9senter le professeur Jain n'est pas jug\u00e9e admissible. La question de ses comp\u00e9tences aux fins de son t\u00e9moignage en l'esp\u00e8ce devient donc sans objet et n'a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre examin\u00e9e.\nJe certifie par la pr\u00e9sente que ce document est une repr\u00e9sentation conforme et exacte de ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate \u00e9mise aux parties le 29 octobre 2003 dans l'affaire ci-haut mentionn\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n2003 TCDP 5\n2003\/02\/11\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur la question \u00e0 savoir si la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) et la plaignante sont tenues de divulguer le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement de deux autres plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne.\n[2] La plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 sont tous deux \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. En 1998, ils \u00e9taient tous les deux membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la section locale de leur syndicat, le Syndicat des employ\u00e9s des postes et des communications (le SEPC), qui est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (l\u2019AFPC). La plaignante pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e sexuellement de fa\u00e7on continue durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle a fait partie de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif. Par suite de ce pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harc\u00e8lement, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission des plaintes contre l\u2019intim\u00e9, le SEPC et l\u2019AFPC.\n[3] Les plaintes port\u00e9es contre les syndicats (dossiers de la Commission nos H48451 et H48449) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es en d\u00e9cembre 2002. Les conditions du r\u00e8glement ont depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par la Commission, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 de la Loi. Toutefois, il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019entente avec l\u2019intim\u00e9, et l\u2019audience sur le fond de la plainte dont il est l\u2019objet a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 13 janvier 2003. Une deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie de dates ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es pour l\u2019audience, qui doit d\u00e9buter le 17 f\u00e9vrier 2003.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a contest\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019on ne lui ait communiqu\u00e9 aucune copie du compte rendu du r\u00e8glement conclu avec les syndicats. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne soit pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat et agisse en son propre nom, je crois comprendre qu\u2019il soutient avoir droit \u00e0 ce que ce document lui soit communiqu\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal. Ce paragraphe, s\u2019il est lu de concert avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d), oblige une partie \u00e0 fournir aux autres parties une copie de tous les documents en sa possession qui sont pertinents \u00e0 toute question en cause et pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9. Le crit\u00e8re qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard consiste en fait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les documents en question sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019audience.\n[5] La Commission et la plaignante ne sont pas dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 divulguer le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement. La Commission a plut\u00f4t soumis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un \u00e9crit qu\u2019elle qualifie de [TRADUCTION] sommaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des conditions de r\u00e8glement. Ce sommaire, qui est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sous forme t\u00e9l\u00e9graphique, comporte quatre paragraphes. Il se veut un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de l\u2019entente (d\u00e9pouill\u00e9e de son langage technique), \u00e0 une exception pr\u00e8s : on n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 les sommes d\u2019argent que les syndicats se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 verser \u00e0 la plaignante. Outre le sommaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u copie de la lettre d\u2019excuses des syndicats \u00e0 la plaignante, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux conditions de l\u2019entente. Selon l\u2019avocat de la Commission, le r\u00e8glement des deux plaintes a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction d\u2019un seul et m\u00eame document. Le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement comporte une clause de non-divulgation des conditions du r\u00e8glement.\n[6] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas satisfait de ce niveau de divulgation et a express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 que soient divulgu\u00e9es les sommes d\u2019argent que les syndicats ont vers\u00e9es \u00e0 la plaignante. Je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que je n\u2019ai pas vu le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement en question.\n[7] Compte tenu du fait que les syndicats, qui ne sont pas parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les signataires de l\u2019entente, j\u2019ai jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de leur demander leur avis au sujet de cette question de divulgation. Ils ont exprim\u00e9 leur position commune dans une lettre sign\u00e9e par M. Craig Spencer, conseiller juridique \u00e0 la Direction des programmes des membres de l\u2019AFPC. Les syndicats partagent l\u2019avis de la plaignante et de la Commission, \u00e0 savoir que le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement ne devrait pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. Les objections de la Commission et de la plaignante semblent se limiter \u00e0 la divulgation des sommes d\u2019argent proprement dites. La Commission et la plaignante sont r\u00e9ceptives \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de communiquer le reste du compte rendu du r\u00e8glement.\nI. S\u2019AGIT\u2011IL D\u2019UN DOCUMENT PERTINENT \u00c0 L\u2019\u00c9GARD D\u2019UNE QUESTION EN LITIGE? [8] Les syndicats soutiennent, apparemment avec l\u2019accord de la Commission et de la plaignante, que les questions qui \u00e9taient en cause dans les plaintes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es n\u2019ont absolument aucun rapport avec les litiges ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte contre l\u2019intim\u00e9. Cette derni\u00e8re plainte porte sur des faits et gestes particuliers qui violeraient la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). En revanche, les plaintes port\u00e9es contre les syndicats, bien qu\u2019elles d\u00e9coulent des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s faits et gestes de l\u2019intim\u00e9, sont distinctes du fait qu\u2019elles ont trait particuli\u00e8rement au cadre administratif \u00e9tabli par l\u2019AFPC et le SEPC en vue de l\u2019examen des plaintes de harc\u00e8lement dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s syndicales. Comme on peut le constater \u00e0 la lecture du libell\u00e9 des plaintes port\u00e9es contre le syndicat, la plaignante est d\u2019avis que le syst\u00e8me de traitement des plaintes de harc\u00e8lement mis en place par les syndicats n\u2019a pas permis d\u2019examiner en temps opportun ses pr\u00e9occupations.\n[9] En fait, les deux plaintes dont ces organismes syndicaux ont fait l\u2019objet portaient en bonne partie sur la pi\u00e8tre fa\u00e7on dont les dirigeants syndicaux ont trait\u00e9 ses plaintes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Dans la plainte relative aux droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a contrevenu \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 de la Loi uniquement. Cet article pr\u00e9cise que le fait de harceler un individu constitue un acte discriminatoire s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un des motifs de discrimination illicite, y compris le sexe. Cependant, dans le cas des plaintes port\u00e9es contre les syndicats, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que non seulement l\u2019article 14 a \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreint, mais aussi les articles 7 et 9. Aux termes de l\u2019article 7, le fait de d\u00e9favoriser un individu en cours d\u2019emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire et, \u00e9l\u00e9ment plus important, le fait d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019adh\u00e9sion d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019expulser ou de suspendre un adh\u00e9rent constitue, en vertu de l\u2019art. 9, un acte discriminatoire s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un des motifs de distinction illicite, y compris le sexe. Par cons\u00e9quent, la responsabilit\u00e9 que la Commission a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 imputer aux syndicats \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, du moins en partie, sur la fa\u00e7on dont ils avaient trait\u00e9 leur membre \u00e0 la suite de ses all\u00e9gations voulant qu\u2019un autre membre de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif l\u2019ait harcel\u00e9e sexuellement.\n[10] Les syndicats font valoir qu\u2019ils auraient pu \u00eatre jug\u00e9s responsables, peu importe le r\u00e9sultat de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019intim\u00e9. Leur avocat a indiqu\u00e9 que si le Tribunal devait conclure que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas harcel\u00e9 la plaignante, les syndicats ne chercheraient pas \u00e0 rouvrir l\u2019entente ou \u00e0 la faire invalider.\n[11] On a fait remarquer que les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants de l\u2019entente qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s sont les sommes d\u2019argent. Compte tenu de la responsabilit\u00e9 distincte des syndicats, d\u2019une part, et de l\u2019intim\u00e9, d\u2019autre part, les montants d\u2019argent vers\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante par les syndicats ne sont pas pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des indemnit\u00e9s qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. La Commission a fait observer que, selon le sommaire du compte rendu du r\u00e8glement mentionn\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante par les syndicats visait strictement \u00e0 compenser, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi, le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle avait subi. Aucune indemnit\u00e9 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des pertes salariales (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., les honoraires auxquels avaient droit les dirigeants syndicaux) ou des d\u00e9pens. Revenons\u2011en \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La lettre conjointe de pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission et de la plaignante indique que celle\u2011ci exige que l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019indemnise de ses d\u00e9pens et lui verse une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e).\n[12] Par cons\u00e9quent, une indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de m\u00eame qu\u2019aux syndicats. La Commission a fait valoir que ces r\u00e9clamations ne sont n\u00e9anmoins pas reli\u00e9es. La plaignante avait droit selon la Loi de r\u00e9clamer contre chacun des intim\u00e9s initiaux une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral pouvant atteindre 20 000 $ (indemnit\u00e9 maximale). L\u2019avocat de la Commission m\u2019a cit\u00e9 les conclusions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans Ghosh v. Domglas Inc. (No. 2) en ce qui concerne le redressement pr\u00e9vu par le Code ontarien des droits de la personne, qui autorise une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e0 accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pouvant atteindre 10 000 $ pour souffrance morale. La commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION] Bien qu\u2019il limite le montant pouvant \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnisation pour dommages moraux, le Code n\u2019impose pas de restrictions quant au nombre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s qu\u2019une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate peut ordonner de verser au terme d\u2019une audience dans les cas o\u00f9 elle estime que des droits distincts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreints dans le cadre d\u2019incidents diff\u00e9rents ou de s\u00e9ries d\u2019incidents diff\u00e9rentes, peu importe si les intim\u00e9s sont les m\u00eames ou s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019intim\u00e9s diff\u00e9rents.\nUne conclusion similaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans une d\u00e9cision rendue plus r\u00e9cemment par une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019affaire Moffat v. Kinark Child and Family Services.\n[13] De l\u2019avis de la Commission, on peut \u00e9tendre ce m\u00eame raisonnement aux mesures de redressement pr\u00e9vues par la Loi et notamment par son alin\u00e9a 50(2)e). Si le droit \u00e0 r\u00e9paration pour pr\u00e9judice moral est propre \u00e0 chaque plainte, les montants que la plaignante a re\u00e7us des syndicats ne peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9duits de ce qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, les montants que la plaignante peut avoir re\u00e7us des autres intim\u00e9s ne sont pas pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[14] Cet argument est fond\u00e9 sur le principe que le Tribunal sera en mesure de distinguer le pr\u00e9judice moral que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a inflig\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de celui d\u00e9coulant de la conduite des syndicats. Il est possible que le Tribunal ne soit pas \u00e0 m\u00eame de faire une telle distinction. Les trois plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne et la lettre conjointe de pr\u00e9cisions incitent toutes \u00e0 croire que les faits et gestes des syndicats ainsi que leurs omissions sont survenus en bonne partie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque m\u00eame o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment harcel\u00e9 la plaignante. Si je fais droit \u00e0 la plainte contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 et conclus que la plaignante a subi un pr\u00e9judice moral au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, il se peut fort bien que je ne sois pas en mesure de distinguer le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de celui d\u00e9coulant de la conduite des syndicats. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourrait soutenir qu\u2019on ne devrait pas lui ordonner d\u2019indemniser la plaignante pour l\u2019ensemble du pr\u00e9judice moral subi. La divulgation des sommes d\u2019argent que la plaignante peut avoir re\u00e7ues des syndicats est pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une question en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 tout le moins pour \u00e9viter une double indemnisation de la plaignante. J\u2019estime que le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement pourrait \u00eatre pertinent, ne serait\u2011ce que pour ce motif.\n[15] Cependant, la responsabilit\u00e9 des syndicats est-elle aussi distincte qu\u2019on le pr\u00e9tend? Il est vrai qu\u2019il est fait mention, dans les plaintes dont les organismes syndicaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet, des articles 7 et 9 de la Loi et de la conduite particuli\u00e8re des syndicats et de leurs repr\u00e9sentants. Toutefois, selon la lettre conjointe de pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission et de la plaignante, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e avant le r\u00e8glement des plaintes port\u00e9es contre les syndicats, l\u2019une des questions \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est la suivante :\nEst\u2011ce que les syndicats intim\u00e9s, soit le SEPC et l\u2019AFPC, ont pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher les actes de harc\u00e8lement ou att\u00e9nuer leurs effets sur la plaignante, comme le veut l\u2019art. 65 de la Loi?\nLe par. 65(1) est la disposition de la Loi en vertu de laquelle les actes ou omissions commis par un employ\u00e9, un mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par l\u2019organisme; autrement dit, il s\u2019agit de la disposition traitant de la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait d\u2019autrui. Selon le paragraphe 65(2), l\u2019organisme peut se disculper en faisant la preuve qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas consenti aux actes ou omissions en question, qu\u2019il a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour les emp\u00eacher et qu\u2019il a tent\u00e9 par la suite d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer les effets.\n[16] Le fait que la plaignante et la Commission fassent mention de l\u2019article 65 laisse entendre que la responsabilit\u00e9 des syndicats pourrait d\u00e9couler de la responsabilit\u00e9 principale du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harceleur, l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les organismes peuvent \u00eatre condamn\u00e9s individuellement et conjointement avec leurs dirigeants, leurs administrateurs, leurs employ\u00e9s ou leurs mandataires \u00e0 indemniser la plaignante. Voici l\u2019explication qu\u2019on trouve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans la d\u00e9cision Moffat :\n[TRADUCTION] Dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019entreprise intim\u00e9e est jug\u00e9 responsable de la conduite discriminatoire de l\u2019individu mis en cause, l\u2019ordonnance stipule que l\u2019entreprise intim\u00e9e est individuellement et conjointement responsable avec l\u2019individu de l\u2019indemnisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette conduite.\nDans Moffat, la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate a ajout\u00e9 que le fait de conclure \u00e0 une responsabilit\u00e9 du fait d\u2019autrui ne justifie pas l\u2019octroi d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 distincte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette responsabilit\u00e9.\n[17] Par cons\u00e9quent, on pourrait certainement faire valoir que la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e responsabilit\u00e9 des syndicats d\u00e9coule de la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et que les montants re\u00e7us en guise de r\u00e8glement des plaintes port\u00e9es contre les syndicats devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9duits de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 par la plaignante. Les montants vers\u00e9s en guise de r\u00e8glement deviennent donc pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[18] Pour tous ces motifs, je suis persuad\u00e9 que le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement est pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une question \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, soit celle qui consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le montant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 peut \u00eatre tenu de verser en guise d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 s\u2019il est jug\u00e9 responsable.\nII. LE DOCUMENT LITIGIEUX EST\u2011IL PRIVIL\u00c9GI\u00c9? [19] Dans ses arguments \u00e9crits, l\u2019avocat des syndicats a fait observer que, dans la pratique, les parties aux n\u00e9gociations en vue d\u2019un r\u00e8glement s\u2019engagent \u00e0 pr\u00e9server la stricte confidentialit\u00e9 des n\u00e9gociations, [TRADUCTION] et ce afin de les inciter \u00e0 concilier leurs divergences et \u00e0 \u00e9viter des poursuites judiciaires. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019entente est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce au processus d\u2019examen et d\u2019approbation auquel doit se livrer la Commission, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 de la Loi, pour que le r\u00e8glement puisse \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\n[20] Afin de favoriser la r\u00e9alisation de ces objectifs, les tribunaux prot\u00e8gent en fait contre la divulgation les communications faites en vue d\u2019une r\u00e9conciliation ou d\u2019un am\u00e9nagement. Toutefois, comme l\u2019ont expliqu\u00e9 Sopinka, Lederman et Bryant, si les n\u00e9gociations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 couronn\u00e9es de succ\u00e8s et m\u00e8nent \u00e0 une entente mutuelle et que c\u2019est l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou l\u2019entente elle-m\u00eame qui est en litige, il est alors possible d\u2019utiliser les communications comme preuve du r\u00e8glement. Je note que l\u2019analyse que les auteurs ont faite de ce privil\u00e8ge semble graviter autour des communications ayant men\u00e9 au r\u00e8glement, et non autour de l\u2019entente proprement dite. Je conclus implicitement que le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement ne serait pas vis\u00e9 par le privil\u00e8ge. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je suis persuad\u00e9 que les questions touchant l\u2019\u00e9valuation du redressement pour pr\u00e9judice moral sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont trait \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019entente proprement dite. Je ne suis donc pas convaincu que le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement est privil\u00e9gi\u00e9.\nIII. CONCLUSION ET ORDONNANCE [21] J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 la plaignante de communiquer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, avant 16 h le jeudi 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003, le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement conclu avec l\u2019AFPC et le SEPC. Cette communication prendra la forme de copies du document, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal.\n[22] Afin de dissiper certaines des pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9, j\u2019ordonne la divulgation du document aux conditions suivantes :\nl\u2019intim\u00e9 ne doit consulter le document qu\u2019aux fins de l\u2019audience; l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne doit pas divulguer ni le document ni son contenu \u00e0 qui que ce soit, sauf \u00e0 son avocat, s\u2019il en a un; l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne doit pas faire de copies du document en question et doit retourner celui\u2011ci \u00e0 la Commission dans la semaine qui suivra la cl\u00f4ture de l\u2019audience en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[23] Toute pr\u00e9occupation similaire concernant la recevabilit\u00e9 du document en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience pourra \u00eatre examin\u00e9e dans le cours de celle\u2011ci, peut-\u00eatre dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 tenir les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00e0 huis clos.\nAthanasios D.

Mactavish\n(TRADUCTION)\n[1] Richard Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre Fred Kyburz. Dans sa plainte, il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que M. Kyburz exerce une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la religion, la race et l'origine nationale ou ethnique en communiquant des messages sur son site Web. Selon M. Warman, ces messages exposent \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les non-Chr\u00e9tiens, les non-Blancs et les individus d'autres races, religions et origines nationales ou ethniques, ce qui va \u00e0 l'encontre des dispositions de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et M. Warman ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 modifier la plainte afin d'y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles aux termes de l'article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Selon les auteurs de la requ\u00eate, M. Kyburz a, depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, harcel\u00e9 et menac\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises M. Warman dans des \u00e9crits diffus\u00e9s sur Internet.\n[3] La Commission a indiqu\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions son intention de demander de modifier la plainte afin qu'elle fasse \u00e9tat de l'aspect repr\u00e9sailles. L'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions a \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Kyburz le 29 janvier 2003. En outre, une plainte distincte portant sur les repr\u00e9sailles a \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission en octobre 2002. Au dire de la Commission, M. Kyburz aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant des faits reproch\u00e9s dans la plainte relative aux repr\u00e9sailles; cependant, les documents qui m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis n'indiquent pas clairement \u00e0 quel moment cela se serait produit.\n[4] M. Kyburz n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la Commission dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le Tribunal.\n[5] Une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne n'a rien d'une mise en accusation en droit p\u00e9nal. Le Tribunal a la pouvoir de modifier une plainte afin d'y ajouter des all\u00e9gations, dans la mesure o\u00f9 un pr\u00e9avis suffisant est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 afin de lui permettre de se d\u00e9fendre de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e (1). Le d\u00e9but de l'audience dans cette affaire est pr\u00e9vu le 17 mars 2003. M. Kyburz sera alors au courant depuis au moins un mois et demi qu'une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e contre lui dans cette affaire. Je n'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'aucune preuve indiquant que M. Kyburz subirait un pr\u00e9judice de quelque sorte dans la pr\u00e9paration de sa d\u00e9fense si le Tribunal devait faire droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 modifier la plainte de M. Warman.\n[6] Le Tribunal accorde par la pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et \u00e0 M. Warman l'autorisation de modifier la plainte afin d'y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles aux termes de l'article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La Commission et M. Warman ont 10 jours pour signifier et d\u00e9poser un formulaire de plainte modifi\u00e9 ainsi qu'un expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des questions en litige et tout document suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 divulguer.\nOriginale sign\u00e9e par\nAnne L.

L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a consenti \u00e0 accepter la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un certain nombre de subpoenas qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis \u00e0 la plaignante, mais a demand\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 pour frais de d\u00e9placement et de comparution. La plaignante m\u2019a donc demand\u00e9 de stipuler les frais \u00e0 acquitter.\n[2] Cet aspect est abord\u00e9 au paragraphe 50(6) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, qui pr\u00e9cise que les t\u00e9moins assign\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre peuvent, \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du membre instructeur, recevoir les frais et indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9s aux t\u00e9moins assign\u00e9s devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Je note que les t\u00e9moins peuvent recevoir ces frais et indemnit\u00e9s; bien que le paragraphe en question me donne un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, je crois que les frais et indemnit\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il existe des raisons imp\u00e9rieuses de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la pratique normale. T\u00e9moigner \u00e0 une audience cause des inconv\u00e9nients et entra\u00eene souvent des complications, car ce devoir exige de r\u00e9am\u00e9nager son emploi du temps pour rendre service \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Je suis fermement convaincu que les t\u00e9moins doivent \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9s pour ces d\u00e9rangements. Par ailleurs, le fait d\u2019avoir \u00e0 demander des subpoenas et \u00e0 payer les frais aff\u00e9rents peut d\u00e9courager les parties d\u2019assigner des t\u00e9moins inutiles.\n[3] \u00c0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la pratique \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est r\u00e9gie par les r\u00e8gles 42 et 43 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, qui pr\u00e9cise que les t\u00e9moins ont droit aux frais et indemnit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vus dans le Tarif A. L\u2019article 3 du Tarif stipule qu\u2019un t\u00e9moin a le droit de recevoir la somme de 20 $ par jour plus les frais de d\u00e9placement raisonnables, ou l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e dans des circonstances similaires pour une comparution devant la cour sup\u00e9rieure de la province o\u00f9 il compara\u00eet si cette indemnit\u00e9 est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. \u00c0 ma connaissance, le Tribunal n\u2019a jamais statu\u00e9 l\u00e0\u2011dessus; toutefois, je crois que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment discr\u00e9tionnaire du paragraphe 50(6) de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne me permet d\u2019ajuster ces montants en fonction des circonstances de l\u2019affaire. Les frais ne doivent pas \u00eatre \u00e9lev\u00e9s au point de brimer le droit de la partie plaignante de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve.\n[4] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime avoir le pouvoir d\u2019accorder une indemnit\u00e9 unique de 25 $ (frais de d\u00e9placement inclus) aux t\u00e9moins ordinaires de la ville de Victoria. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9placement et de comparution qui doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9e aux t\u00e9moins au moment o\u00f9 ils re\u00e7oivent leur subpoena. Les t\u00e9moins ne sont pas tenus de compara\u00eetre devant le Tribunal s\u2019ils ne re\u00e7oivent pas l\u2019argent.\n[5] Je suis conscient du fait que cette indemnit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre per\u00e7ue comme une forme de paiement plut\u00f4t th\u00e9orique. Je crois n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019elle a une valeur symbolique du fait qu\u2019elle reconna\u00eet le r\u00f4le crucial des t\u00e9moins dans le syst\u00e8me de justice. Si des t\u00e9moins doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l\u2019audience pendant une longue p\u00e9riode, la question pourra \u00eatre r\u00e9examin\u00e9e.\nPaul Groarke\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS DU TRIBUNAL Nos :\nT627\/1501 et T628\/1601\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nAmanda Day c. minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale et Michael Hortie\nDATE DE LA D\u00c9CISION DU TRIBUNAL :\nle 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003\nONT COMPARU :\nAmanda Day\nen son propre nom\nJoyce Thayer nationale\nau nom du minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense\nJ.

Hadjis\n(TRADUCTION)\n[1] La plaignante est atteinte d'une d\u00e9ficience qui l'oblige \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer \u00e0 l'aide d'un fauteuil roulant. Elle all\u00e8gue que les succursales de l'intim\u00e9e situ\u00e9es \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de sa r\u00e9sidence sont inaccessibles aux fauteuils roulants et qu'elle fait l'objet, par cons\u00e9quent, d'une discrimination aux termes de l'art. 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire visant le rejet de la plainte. Elle pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte pour cause d'absence d'impartialit\u00e9 et d'ind\u00e9pendance institutionnelles.\n[3] L'intim\u00e9e soutient qu'il ne peut \u00eatre port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 son droit, consacr\u00e9 par le par. 2e) de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits (1), \u00e0 une audition impartiale de sa cause, selon les principes de justice fondamentale. \u00c0 son avis, ce droit est en fait une norme constitutionnelle qui s'applique \u00e0 l'ensemble des tribunaux canadiens et non simplement aux cours sup\u00e9rieures de comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente (2). L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la fonction et la structure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, telles que d\u00e9crites dans la Loi, ne diff\u00e8rent gu\u00e8re de celles qui caract\u00e9risent les cours.\n[4] L'intim\u00e9e fait \u00e9galement valoir que la Loi est un instrument permettant de pr\u00e9server les droits \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 consacr\u00e9s par l'art. 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (la Charte). Par cons\u00e9quent, la comp\u00e9tence que la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne se veut le prolongement de la protection des droits constitutionnels qui est garantie en vertu de la Charte. Les proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal doivent donc \u00eatre men\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment aux normes d'ind\u00e9pendance et d'impartialit\u00e9 institutionnelles les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es.\n[5] L'intim\u00e9e admet que, dans l'arr\u00eat Ocean Port Hotel c. Colombie-Britannique, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a reconnu que bien que certains tribunaux administratifs puissent \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 rendre des d\u00e9cisions quasi judiciaires, le degr\u00e9 d'ind\u00e9pendance exig\u00e9 d'un tribunal administratif donn\u00e9 est fonction de l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur et, en l'absence de contraintes institutionnelles, il convient de respecter ce choix (3). Toutefois, l'intim\u00e9e ajoute que la fonction et le r\u00f4le du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de droits qui sont eux-m\u00eames d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de la Charte imposent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le genre de contraintes institutionnelles dont il est fait \u00e9tat dans l'arr\u00eat Ocean Port. Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu'il s'agit d'\u00e9valuer le degr\u00e9 d'ind\u00e9pendance du Tribunal, on ne devrait pas simplement s'en remettre \u00e0 l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur. En fait, le Tribunal devrait \u00eatre jug\u00e9 selon la m\u00eame norme constitutionnelle que celle qui s'applique aux cours sup\u00e9rieures. Les cours provinciales sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 soumises \u00e0 cet imp\u00e9ratif constitutionnel (4).\n[6] L'intim\u00e9e soutient que, au regard de cette norme, au moins deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments du cadre l\u00e9gislatif de la Loi soul\u00e8vent la question de l'ind\u00e9pendance et de l'impartialit\u00e9 du Tribunal. Le premier a trait au pouvoir que l'art. 27 de la Loi conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) de pr\u00e9ciser, par ordonnance, les limites et les modalit\u00e9s de l'application de la Loi dans une cat\u00e9gorie de cas donn\u00e9s. L'intim\u00e9e fait valoir que le mandat de la Commission aux termes de la Loi est de repr\u00e9senter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, obligation qui, en dernier ressort, incombe \u00e0 l'\u00c9tat. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'\u00c9tat ou, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, un organe du pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif peut, en vertu de ce pouvoir d'\u00e9mettre des ordonnances, compara\u00eetre devant le Tribunal et lui donner parall\u00e8lement des instructions quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation d'une loi du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif. Le caract\u00e8re ex\u00e9cutoire de ces ordonnances aurait pour effet de contraindre le Tribunal \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 son r\u00f4le en ce qui touche l'interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions de la Loi.\n[7] Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment soulev\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e a rapport aux dispositions du par. 48.2(2) de la Loi qui exigent qu'un membre du Tribunal dont le mandat est \u00e9chu obtienne l'agr\u00e9ment du pr\u00e9sident pour terminer les affaires dont il est saisi. Selon l'intim\u00e9e, l'inamovibilit\u00e9 des membres est soumise au pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du pr\u00e9sident. L'intim\u00e9e soutient qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, il est illusoire de s'attendre \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal puisse raisonnablement \u00eatre per\u00e7u comme ayant l'ind\u00e9pendance institutionnelle n\u00e9cessaire.\n[8] Pour ces motifs, l'intim\u00e9e soutient qu'il existe une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 institutionnelle et que le Tribunal devrait, par cons\u00e9quent, refuser d'instruire la plainte.\n[9] La Commission est d'avis qu'elle n'a pas \u00e0 r\u00e9pliquer directement aux arguments invoqu\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e en ce qui concerne l'ind\u00e9pendance et l'impartialit\u00e9 institutionnelles du Tribunal. La Commission fait valoir que la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a tranch\u00e9 ces m\u00eames questions dans Bell Canada c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) (5), affaire qui avait trait \u00e0 une plainte de discrimination salariale d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Bell Canada et que la Commission avait \u00e9ventuellement renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[10] Bell Canada a soutenu devant la Cour qu'en raison de la partialit\u00e9 institutionnelle du Tribunal et de son absence d'ind\u00e9pendance, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la justice naturelle. Bell a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment invoqu\u00e9 les m\u00eames dispositions de la Loi que celles auxquelles l'intim\u00e9e a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans ses observations (par. 27(2) et 48.2(2)). Cependant, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que ni l'une ni l'autre de ces dispositions ne cr\u00e9e une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Bell Canada en a appel\u00e9 de ce jugement devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Les plaidoiries dans ce pourvoi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s il y a quelques semaines \u00e0 peine (le 23 janvier 2003). On pr\u00e9voit qu'il faudra attendre plusieurs mois avant que la Cour rende sa d\u00e9cision.\n[11] La Commission soutient que le Tribunal demeure li\u00e9 par l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale portant sur ces questions, et ce sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'appel en instance. De toute \u00e9vidence, il ne s'agit pas d'une chose jug\u00e9e (res judicata), ne serait-ce que parce que les parties dans l'affaire Bell Canada et la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne sont pas les m\u00eames. Cependant, en vertu du principe du stare decisis, un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent ou une d\u00e9cision d'une cour lie les cours et tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs dans la hi\u00e9rarchie judiciaire (6). Je suis persuad\u00e9 que l'arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'affaire Bell Canada porte sur les dispositions pr\u00e9cises de la Loi qui sont invoqu\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce et que les questions de droit soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces dispositions sont essentiellement les m\u00eames.\n[12] N\u00e9anmoins, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 que je ne suis pas n\u00e9cessairement li\u00e9 par le jugement de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu avant que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada rende publique sa d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Mackin c. Nouveau-Brunswick (minist\u00e8re des Finances) (7). Il est sous-entendu, par cons\u00e9quent, que la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est parvenue \u00e0 ses conclusions sans avoir b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de ce jugement plus r\u00e9cent de la Cour supr\u00eame sur la question de l'ind\u00e9pendance et de l'impartialit\u00e9 institutionnelles.\n[13] L'affaire Mackin avait trait \u00e0 des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives ayant pour effet de supprimer le syst\u00e8me de juges surnum\u00e9raires qui existait \u00e0 la Cour provinciale du Nouveau-Brunswick afin de le remplacer par un tableau de juges \u00e0 la retraite r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s sur une base journali\u00e8re. La Cour a soutenu que les modifications apport\u00e9es par ces dispositions aux modalit\u00e9s de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des juges influaient sur leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re et constituaient une violation des garanties institutionnelles d'ind\u00e9pendance judiciaire \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 11d) de la Charte. La loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inconstitutionnelle.\n[14] En \u00e9non\u00e7ant dans Mackin le droit en mati\u00e8re d'ind\u00e9pendance et d'impartialit\u00e9 judiciaires, la Cour supr\u00eame s'est fond\u00e9e sur les principes formul\u00e9s dans des arr\u00eats rendus avant le jugement de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'affaire Bell Canada, soit Valente c. R. (8) et le Renvoi relatif aux juges de la Cour provinciale (9). L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 comment l'analyse du droit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans Mackin aurait \u00e9clair\u00e9 la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il y a lieu \u00e9galement de mentionner que la Cour supr\u00eame a concentr\u00e9 son attention sur l'ind\u00e9pendance judiciaire et l'impartialit\u00e9 des cours et non des tribunaux administratifs. En outre, les conclusions de la Cour au sujet de l'inamovibilit\u00e9 sont d'une utilit\u00e9 douteuse \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des arguments invoqu\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans Mackin, la Cour supr\u00eame a statu\u00e9 que la suppression du syst\u00e8me de juges surnum\u00e9raires n'influait pas sur l'inamovibilit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour provinciale. Pour toutes ces raisons, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que le fait que la Cour supr\u00eame ait rendu subs\u00e9quemment son jugement dans l'affaire Mackin influe sur l'impact des conclusions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans Bell Canada sur les questions dont je suis saisi.\n[15] Selon l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e, on ne fait aucunement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans l'arr\u00eat Bell Canada au lien entre l'art. 15 de la Charte et la Loi. Je ne suis saisi d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve indiquant quels arguments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s devant la Cour. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, je ne crois pas que cette facette des pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9e ajoute beaucoup \u00e0 son argumentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il ne faut pas perdre de vue le fait que ce qui est au c\u009cur de l'argumentation de l'intim\u00e9e, c'est son affirmation voulant que le pouvoir de la Commission d'\u00e9mettre des ordonnances, en vertu du par. 27(2) de la Loi, et le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dont jouit le pr\u00e9sident aux termes du par. 48.2(2), cr\u00e9ent une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 institutionnelle. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s'est pench\u00e9e sur ces m\u00eames \u00e9l\u00e9ments et a statu\u00e9 qu'ils ne portaient pas atteinte \u00e0 l'ind\u00e9pendance et l'impartialit\u00e9 institutionnelles du Tribunal.\n[16] Il est tout \u00e0 fait possible que la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ait tenu compte dans ses conclusions des r\u00e9percussions constitutionnelles - s'il en est - sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Il serait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9somptueux de ma part de tenter de me d\u00e9marquer des conclusions formul\u00e9es dans un arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui porte directement sur les questions particuli\u00e8res dont je suis saisi, simplement parce qu'un certain argument juridique n'y est pas \u00e9nonc\u00e9, d'autant plus que je ne suis saisi d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve me donnant \u00e0 croire que cette question n'a pas en fait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par les avocats dans le cadre des observations qu'ils ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 la Cour.\n[17] En outre, je n'admets pas l'id\u00e9e que je puisse faire abstraction des conclusions de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale simplement parce que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada est maintenant saisie de la question. Dans Hujdic c. Air Canada (10), Air Canada a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate dans laquelle elle pr\u00e9tendait qu'il existait une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 institutionnelle \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du Tribunal. La requ\u00eate en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e apr\u00e8s que la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale eut rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans Bell Canada. Dans sa d\u00e9cision portant sur la requ\u00eate, la pr\u00e9sidente a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n\u00c0 mon avis, le fait que Bell Canada demande l'autorisation d'en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'est pas pertinent. \u00c0 ce moment-ci, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est un prononc\u00e9 formel valide et repr\u00e9sente l'\u00e9tat du droit (11).\n[18] La d\u00e9cision Hujdic a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par le Tribunal avant que la Cour supr\u00eame d\u00e9cide d'accorder \u00e0 Bell Canada l'autorisation d'en appeler du jugement. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que le fait que l'affaire ait maintenant \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite et prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame fasse une diff\u00e9rence. Le jugement de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale continue de repr\u00e9senter l'\u00e9tat du droit tant que cette cour ou la Cour supr\u00eame n'en n'a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 autrement.\n[19] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nD\u00c9PENS [20] L'avocate de la Commission est d'avis que, compte tenu du caract\u00e8re imp\u00e9ratif du jugement prononc\u00e9 par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'affaire Bell Canada, la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de tout fondement et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission devrait se voir adjuger les d\u00e9pens. La Commission all\u00e8gue que [TRADUCTION] beaucoup de ressources et de deniers publics ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9s [TRADUCTION] \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration et \u00e0 l'audition de la requ\u00eate ainsi qu'aux d\u00e9placements y aff\u00e9rents. L'avocate de la Commission admet que la Loi ne comporte aucune disposition qui accorde le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens \u00e0 la Commission. Cependant, elle soutient qu'en l'absence d'une interdiction expresse \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal peut rendre une telle ordonnance du fait qu'il est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure.\n[21] Je ne suis pas convaincu que le comportement de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de cette requ\u00eate ait \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi malveillant que la Commission le laisse entendre. Le Tribunal accorde g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 toutes les parties la possibilit\u00e9 de soulever des questions pr\u00e9liminaires, lesquelles sont examin\u00e9es, s'il y a lieu, bien avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience sur le fond de la plainte. Je suis persuad\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e avait le droit de pr\u00e9senter cette requ\u00eate. Chose certaine, le fait que l'intim\u00e9e ait soulev\u00e9 ainsi une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 lui donne une certaine assurance qu'elle ne sera pas r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de soulever \u00e0 nouveau cette question si la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada infirme la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'affaire Bell Canada (12).\n[22] Pour ce qui est de la question \u00e0 savoir si, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens \u00e0 la Commission, nous l'examinerons un autre jour.\nORDONNANCE [23] La requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e. La demande de la Commission visant \u00e0 lui adjuger les d\u00e9pens est rejet\u00e9e elle aussi.\nOriginale sign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la premi\u00e8re que les Lignes a\u00e9riennes Canadien International Lt\u00e9e ont exerc\u00e9 envers Yul F. Hill une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, en ne lui offrant pas une formation technique en cours d'emploi, en sapant son travail, en lui refusant une promotion et en le soumettant \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le plus serr\u00e9 que celui exerc\u00e9 sur d'autres employ\u00e9s. Cette discrimination aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e entre juin 1992 et la date de l'audience, bien qu'elle ait commenc\u00e9 avant cette date. Dans la deuxi\u00e8me plainte, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que Canadien n'a pas assur\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hill un milieu exempt de harc\u00e8lement, comme l'exige l'article 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Ce harc\u00e8lement, qui aurait pris la forme de graffitis, d'insultes et de mauvaises plaisanteries, se serait produit entre janvier 1991 et octobre 1994.\n[2] Ces plaintes sont de nature personnelle plut\u00f4t que syst\u00e9mique. Il existe apparemment une troisi\u00e8me plainte qui porte sur une plus vaste probl\u00e9matique touchant le milieu de travail et qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Le plaignant et la Commission ont n\u00e9anmoins invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui de leur argumentation la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e tendance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la discrimination au sein du milieu de travail. Cette approche pose probl\u00e8me, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'existe pas de lien clair entre les exp\u00e9riences de M. Hill et la situation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l'atelier moteur.\n[3] Air Canada, en tant que soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ayant remplac\u00e9 les Lignes a\u00e9riennes Canadien International Lt\u00e9e, a accept\u00e9 toute responsabilit\u00e9 que Canadien a pu encourir en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L'audience sur les plaintes, qui a eu lieu \u00e0 Vancouver, a dur\u00e9 25 jours. Ont comparu 18 t\u00e9moins. \u00c0 la fin de l'audience, j'ai re\u00e7u des observations orales et \u00e9crites qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d'une grande utilit\u00e9. Me Ash et Me Fakirani, qui repr\u00e9sentaient le plaignant et la Commission, respectivement, ont fait un bel effort pour \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 des plaintes, mais les faits ne plaident tout simplement pas en leur faveur.\n[4] Le plaignant et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ont pr\u00e9tendu que le fait d'\u00eatre de race noire explique le traitement d\u00e9favorable subi. M. Hill a fait l'objet, semble-t-il, de discrimination de la part de son contrema\u00eetre et de harc\u00e8lement de la part de son contrema\u00eetre et d'autres m\u00e9caniciens. La situation a atteint son paroxysme le 18 octobre 1994 dans le bureau du superviseur, o\u00f9 elle a d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 en un \u00e9change virulent et charg\u00e9 d'\u00e9motion entre M. Hill et son contrema\u00eetre. Pour son propre bien-\u00eatre, M. Hill a alors cru bon de quitter le lieu de travail.\n[5] Air Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que M. Hill \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 probl\u00e8me qui \u00e9vitait le travail et faisait consciemment montre d'un manque de respect pour l'autorit\u00e9.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9peint le plaignant comme quelqu'un qui \u00e9tait prompt \u00e0 attribuer ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 sa race. Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, elle fait l'affirmation suivante :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLe plaignant a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment de certains autres m\u00e9caniciens affect\u00e9s au Dash-80 en ce qui touche l'attribution des t\u00e2ches, mais cela n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec sa race et avait tout \u00e0 voir avec ses comp\u00e9tences et son attitude en tant que m\u00e9canicien.\nElle fait aussi l'affirmation ci-apr\u00e8s :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLe plaignant a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 surveill\u00e9 plus \u00e9troitement que d'autres employ\u00e9s; cependant, ce n'\u00e9tait pas en raison de sa race, de sa couleur ou de son origine nationale ou ethnique, mais plut\u00f4t parce qu'il avait tendance \u00e0 s'absenter de son poste de travail plus fr\u00e9quemment que d'autres employ\u00e9s\nL'intim\u00e9e soutient que le plaignant bl\u00e2mait les autres pour ses probl\u00e8mes. Plut\u00f4t que de modifier ses habitudes de travail ou de suivre les voies habituelles pour obtenir de l'avancement, il est tomb\u00e9 dans le pi\u00e8ge de tenir pour acquis que ceux qui l'entouraient le traitaient de fa\u00e7on injuste.\nB. Les questions pr\u00e9liminaires [7] Durant l'audience, j'ai fait une visite de l'atelier moteur. Cette visite a fait l'objet d'une d\u00e9cision distincte. Dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, il suffit de dire que la visite en question a beaucoup aid\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre le reste de la preuve. M\u00eame si l'atelier a fait l'objet de certains r\u00e9am\u00e9nagements, le plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des lieux \u00e9tait le m\u00eame qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Hill travaillait chez Canadien. Les bureaux des superviseurs et des contrema\u00eetres \u00e9taient toujours l\u00e0 et le travail \u00e9tait organis\u00e9 encore de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re. La visite des lieux m'a permis, d'une part, de mieux comprendre les pratiques suivies pour l'assemblage des moteurs, ainsi que la nature du travail effectu\u00e9 dans diff\u00e9rents secteurs et, d'autre part, de visualiser le milieu de travail. Elle a renforc\u00e9 l'id\u00e9e que l'atelier \u00e9tait g\u00e9r\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on comp\u00e9tente et a peut-\u00eatre appuy\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on implicite la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par divers t\u00e9moins; toutefois, elle n'a pas influenc\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on importante mes conclusions de fait.\n[8] Avant d'exposer les faits, j'aimerais toutefois aborder une autre question de droit. L'une des principales difficult\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait que la plupart des t\u00e9moignages portaient sur des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90. On m'a fourni diverses estimations quant au nombre de personnes qui travaillaient \u00e0 l'atelier moteur; cependant, je n'ai entendu, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, qu'un nombre relativement restreint de t\u00e9moins, dont le t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait souvent vague et fond\u00e9 sur des impressions. Quoi qu'il en soit, il serait difficile d'\u00e9valuer aussi longtemps apr\u00e8s le fait le contexte \u00e9motionnel qui r\u00e9gnait dans un atelier en pleine activit\u00e9. Cela est d'autant plus difficile en l'esp\u00e8ce que la compagnie \u00e9tait au bord de la faillite, que le milieu de travail \u00e9tait en proie \u00e0 l'incertitude et que la situation n'avait rien de normal.\n[9] Je dispose toutefois d'un certain nombre de rapports internes au sujet des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 par le ton de ces rapports, qui d\u00e9notent une grande impartialit\u00e9 et beaucoup de tact face \u00e0 une situation difficile. Les d\u00e9clarations aux auteurs de ces rapports n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sous serment et n'ont pas fait l'objet d'un examen approfondi; elles ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es \u00e0 b\u00e2tons rompus. Elles pr\u00e9sentent n\u00e9anmoins une certaine spontan\u00e9it\u00e9 qui aide \u00e0 se faire une id\u00e9e de ce qui se passait \u00e0 l'atelier. M\u00eame si j'ai re\u00e7u d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont clarifi\u00e9 certaines questions, je crois que ces rapports devraient \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis.\n[10] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la preuve confirme les rapports initiaux \u00e0 propos de ce qui s'est produit. Je crois qu'il est logique de porter une attention particuli\u00e8re aux d\u00e9clarations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites avant que les participants aient l'occasion d'adapter leurs motifs aux besoins de la cause. Cette affirmation doit toutefois \u00eatre nuanc\u00e9e. D'une part, il faut se garder d'interpr\u00e9ter les rapports au pied de la lettre, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les d\u00e9clarations faites n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9es textuellement par les enqu\u00eateurs. D'autre part, il est \u00e9vident que les personnes interrog\u00e9es par Laurie Ferguson et Hunter Rogers se sont exprim\u00e9s plus librement qu'ils ne l'ont fait \u00e0 l'audience.\nII. FAITS A. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 i) Le plaignant [11] J'admets que le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les faits de la fa\u00e7on dont il les a per\u00e7us. Cela ne signifie pas que j'accepte la description qu'il en a faite. M. Hill a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin partial; sa perception des faits \u00e9tait souvent influenc\u00e9e par ses sentiments. Il a eu tendance \u00e0 tout ramener \u00e0 un d\u00e9nominateur commun : le traitement injuste dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet. Les t\u00e9moignages d'autres t\u00e9moins, notamment celui de M. Fletcher, appuient cette conclusion.\n[12] \u00c0 mon avis, les divergences entre les parties d\u00e9coulent surtout de l'interpr\u00e9tation des faits. J'ai n\u00e9anmoins constat\u00e9 que le comportement de M. Hill dans la salle d'audience \u00e9tait fonci\u00e8rement agressif. Je comprends son sentiment d'injustice, mais il s'est nettement tromp\u00e9 ou m\u00e9pris sur un certain nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments et n'a pas voulu faire la part des choses. Il est donc \u00e9vident que j'ai rejet\u00e9 une partie de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[13] J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Pinkhasik, qui a permis d'\u00e9tablir que M. Hill souffrait de d\u00e9pression et d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Ce fait n'\u00e9tablit pas le fondement des plaintes pour autant. On a fait un certain nombre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences obscures \u00e0 d'autres probl\u00e8mes que le plaignant a \u00e9prouv\u00e9s dans sa vie et qui pourraient expliquer les troubles psychologiques dont il a souffert.\n[14] Par ailleurs, un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins ont fourni au cours de leur t\u00e9moignage des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve appuyant l'all\u00e9gation de l'employeur voulant que M. Hill ait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les plaintes parce qu'il esp\u00e9rait obtenir un r\u00e8glement comptant. Je crois que les observations faites par M. Hill \u00e0 d'autres m\u00e9caniciens \u00e0 ce propos \u00e9taient d'abord et avant tout une forme de bravade psychologique; toutefois, je crois que la situation est plus compliqu\u00e9e qu'elle ne le para\u00eet. Ce serait une erreur que de douter de la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sentiments de M. Hill voulant qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on injuste.\nii) M. Ryan [15] Je sens par ailleurs le besoin de commenter le t\u00e9moignage de M. Ryan, le contrema\u00eetre de M. Hill, dont la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute par certains t\u00e9moins. On a parl\u00e9, par exemple, des deux visages de Ryan. La pr\u00e9sente affaire est jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point l'histoire des rapports entre M. Hill et M. Ryan. Il ne fait aucun doute dans mon esprit que M. Ryan avait vraiment une attitude hostile envers M. Hill. Selon M. Kirby, M. Ryan provoquait M. Hill d'une fa\u00e7on calcul\u00e9e et sournoise. Je ne suis pas s\u00fbr de cela, mais le langage raciste qu'il semble avoir employ\u00e9 lorsqu'il s'est entretenu avec Laurie Ferguson et Hunter Rogers, comparativement \u00e0 celui qu'il a tenu lors de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'audience, me para\u00eet un reflet plus fid\u00e8le du langage qu'il utilisait \u00e0 l'atelier.\n[16] Je suis n\u00e9anmoins d'avis que M. Ryan n'aimait pas M. Hill parce que celui-ci \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 difficile et sujet \u00e0 des col\u00e8res subites. M. Hill avait de l'ambition, mais il n'\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 en faire plus que le m\u00e9canicien moyen. \u00c0 ses yeux, la plupart de ses t\u00e2ches \u00e9taient avilissantes. Je ne crois pas que c'est la question raciale qui \u00e9tait au c\u009cur des divergences entre les deux hommes. Le vrai probl\u00e8me est que M. Hill n'acceptait pas l'autorit\u00e9 de son contrema\u00eetre. \u00c0 mon avis, M. Ryan en voulait \u00e9galement \u00e0 M. Hill parce qu'il avait port\u00e9 plainte contre lui. M. Ryan se gardait bien d'offenser les personnes en situation d'autorit\u00e9 et a sans doute vu l\u00e0 une tentative pour saper son autorit\u00e9.\n[17] M. Ryan et M. Hill semblent s'\u00eatre livr\u00e9s un combat de titans. Malgr\u00e9 ses d\u00e9fauts, M. Ryan avait une certaine fiert\u00e9 professionnelle et faisait montre de d\u00e9vouement au travail. Pour sa part, M. Hill \u00e9tait d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 affirmer son ind\u00e9pendance. Je n'ai point le d\u00e9sir de m'interposer dans l'affrontement entre les deux hommes mais, chose certaine, ils se sont certes faits un point d'honneur de se provoquer mutuellement. Il ne fait aucun doute que M. Hill en tout cas tentait d' atteindre M. Ryan.\n[18] M. Hill avait le don de contrarier ses sup\u00e9rieurs imm\u00e9diats. Il semble avoir perfectionn\u00e9 son art lorsqu'il a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'atelier moteur. Il \u00e9tait beaucoup plus prudent avec les personnes occupant un rang plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans la hi\u00e9rarchie. Il s'est produit sur la ligne au moins un incident o\u00f9 M. Hill et M. Ryan doivent s'\u00eatre \u00e9chang\u00e9s des regards plut\u00f4t m\u00e9chants; M. Hill avait alors r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 mettre M. Ryan dans tous ses \u00e9tats. Cet incident est survenu lorsque M. Hill a re\u00e7u un nouveau bulletin de service et a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 de refaire du travail qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait.\n[19] J'accorde une grande cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 au t\u00e9moignage de Margery Knorr, l'agente d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, et \u00e0 celui de M. Shelford, le directeur des installations de motopropulsion. L'un et l'autre ont r\u00e9pondu aux questions des deux parties avec circonspection. Bien inform\u00e9s, ils ont fourni des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'information utiles au sujet de la politique de la compagnie. J'ai trouv\u00e9 leur t\u00e9moignage fonci\u00e8rement honn\u00eate. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 \u00e9galement par le t\u00e9moignage de Scott Hunter, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impartial et pr\u00e9cis. M. Hunter faisait partie du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour le poste de planificateur III et j'accepte sans r\u00e9serve son t\u00e9moignage.\n[20] J'ai trouv\u00e9 cr\u00e9dibles les t\u00e9moignages de la plupart des autres t\u00e9moins. M. Kirby serait d'accord \u00e0 mon avis pour dire qu'il avait une orientation id\u00e9ologique qui a transpir\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage. Il a n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 naturel et bien articul\u00e9. Les autres m\u00e9caniciens qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sinc\u00e8res et se sont montr\u00e9s coop\u00e9ratifs. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Ghuman, un membre d'une minorit\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 candide et factuel. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Cavasin a \u00e9t\u00e9 utile tout en \u00e9tant tr\u00e8s r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur des attitudes qui r\u00e9gnaient \u00e0 l'atelier. Une bonne partie des preuves quant aux tensions raciales chez Canadien n'avaient gu\u00e8re rapport, toutefois, avec la situation dans laquelle se trouvait M. Hill. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hibbert, qui estimait \u00eatre l'objet de discrimination, est un bon exemple.\nB. Le cadre [21] Le contexte dans lequel s'inscrivent les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes est simple. Canadien \u00e9tait l'une des principales compagnies a\u00e9riennes commerciales au Canada. \u00c9tant un important transporteur, Canadien avait une division de la maintenance et des services techniques qui exploitait un atelier d'usinage \u00e0 Vancouver. C'est l\u00e0 que la plupart des \u00e9v\u00e9nements pertinents sont survenus. La preuve a permis d'\u00e9tablir que la compagnie a\u00e9rienne \u00e9tait dans une situation financi\u00e8re d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par les plaintes. Personne ne savait si la compagnie allait survivre et les employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient constamment en proie \u00e0 des pressions \u00e9motives et financi\u00e8res.\ni) Le plaignant [22] M. Hill a commenc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re comme technicien de moteurs \u00e0 r\u00e9action dans la marine am\u00e9ricaine; il a pass\u00e9 six ans au sein des forces actives et de r\u00e9serve. Il est entr\u00e9 au service de Canadien \u00e0 titre d'apprenti m\u00e9canicien en 1986 et a travaill\u00e9 environ huit ans pour la compagnie. Il est devenu par la suite m\u00e9canicien \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re. \u00c0 titre de m\u00e9canicien d'a\u00e9ronef, il faisait partie de l'Association internationale des machinistes et des travailleurs de l'a\u00e9rospatiale, connue sous le nom d'AIMTA. Comme c'est souvent le cas, les all\u00e9gations dont je suis saisi ont donn\u00e9 lieu au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de griefs en vertu des conventions collectives pertinentes, ainsi qu'\u00e0 une enqu\u00eate interne sur les droits de la personne.\n[23] Durant son apprentissage, le plaignant a travaill\u00e9 dans la division de la maintenance et des services techniques. En tant que compagnon, il a travaill\u00e9 sur la ligne des 737 dans le hangar. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 l'atelier moteur entre octobre 1989 et d\u00e9cembre 1990, apr\u00e8s quoi il est retourn\u00e9 sur la ligne des 337. Durant son affectation \u00e0 l'atelier moteur, M. Hill faisait partie d'une des \u00e9quipes pr\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 la ligne des Dash-80. En juin 1992, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 l'atelier moteur, o\u00f9 il est demeur\u00e9 jusqu'en mai 1994, date o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 provisoirement affect\u00e9 \u00e0 l'atelier des roues et freins. En ao\u00fbt, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la ligne des Dash-80, o\u00f9 il est demeur\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 son dernier jour de travail, le 18 octobre 1994. Il a n\u00e9anmoins touch\u00e9 une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration jusqu'en janvier 1995.\n[24] Le minist\u00e8re des Transports avait d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 Canadien une licence de m\u00e9canicien applicable \u00e0 l'ensemble de la compagnie. Par cons\u00e9quent, les m\u00e9caniciens \u00e0 l'emploi de Canadien n'avaient pas besoin d'une licence personnelle, mais ils devaient obtenir le pouvoir de certification des a\u00e9ronefs, connu sous le nom d'ACA, pour faire la maintenance d'un moteur particulier. M. Hill \u00e9tait agr\u00e9\u00e9 par la compagnie pour les moteurs CF6-50 et CF6-80. Les m\u00e9caniciens pouvaient \u00e9galement obtenir du minist\u00e8re des Transports des licences personnelles, appel\u00e9es licences M, pour diff\u00e9rents types d'a\u00e9ronefs et de moteurs. Les parties avaient des opinions nettement divergentes quant \u00e0 savoir s'il \u00e9tait vraiment important que M. Hill soit titulaire d'une telle licence, compte tenu du fait que cela n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire. Bien qu'il ne rev\u00eate pas \u00e0 mon avis une importance capitale, cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9montre certes que M. Hill avait de l'ambition et jugeait souhaitable d'acqu\u00e9rir des titres de comp\u00e9tence, contrairement \u00e0 beaucoup d'autres m\u00e9caniciens de Canadien.\nii) La ligne des Dash-80 [25] La division de la maintenance et des services techniques de Canadien \u00e9tait dot\u00e9e d'installations de motopropulsion. Le directeur de ces installations, Graeme Shelford, a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'un certain nombre d'ateliers, dont l'atelier moteur, relevaient de lui. Un cadre du nom de Bob Krause travaillait sous M. Shelford. C'est lui qui \u00e9tait responsable de la gestion au jour le jour des installations et notamment de l'atelier moteur. Il y avait \u00e9galement au sein de chaque atelier des superviseurs qui relevaient directement de M. Krause et, occasionnellement, de M. Shelford. Au cours de la p\u00e9riode qui nous int\u00e9resse, les superviseurs \u00e0 l'atelier moteur \u00e9taient Don Strohmaier, Jerry Jureidin et Al Hunger.\n[26] L'atelier moteur comptait un certain nombre de zones de travail. Il y avait l\u00e0 notamment les lignes o\u00f9 l'on faisait la maintenance des diff\u00e9rents types de moteurs. Il fallait de six \u00e0 dix jours pour d\u00e9monter un moteur et jusqu'\u00e0 deux semaines pour le remonter. La r\u00e9paration des moteurs, des modules et des pi\u00e8ces n'\u00e9tait pas faite sur les lignes. Une fois les moteurs remont\u00e9s, on obtenait les approbations n\u00e9cessaires puis on les v\u00e9rifiait sur le banc d'essai , qui se trouvait dans un grand b\u00e2timent situ\u00e9 sur le m\u00eame terrain. Il y avait aussi le secteur \u00e9quilibrage et le secteur H , mieux connu sous le nom d'atelier de r\u00e9usinage des pales.\n[27] Des \u00e9quipes \u00e9taient affect\u00e9es \u00e0 chacune des zones de travail. Chaque \u00e9quipe comptait au moins six m\u00e9caniciens. Jusqu'\u00e0 l'automne de 1994, chaque \u00e9quipe comprenait un contrema\u00eetre et un inspecteur. Le contrema\u00eetre de M. Hill \u00e9tait Kerry Ryan. Les contrema\u00eetres jouaient surtout le r\u00f4le de chef d'\u00e9quipe et \u00e9taient syndiqu\u00e9s; cependant, ce sont eux qui \u00e9taient charg\u00e9s d'attribuer les t\u00e2ches aux membres des \u00e9quipes. Les inspecteurs approuvaient le travail des membres des \u00e9quipes, ce qui impliquait notamment de signer les autorisations n\u00e9cessaires. Les contrema\u00eetres et les inspecteurs relevaient des superviseurs de l'atelier moteur. Ils n'avaient pas le pouvoir de prendre des mesures disciplinaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des m\u00e9caniciens.\n[28] L'atelier moteur comptait trois lignes, soit celles des moteurs CF6-50, CF6-80 et JD-8. M. Hill faisait partie d'une des trois \u00e9quipes de la ligne des CF6-80 ou Dash-80, qui travaillaient selon un r\u00e9gime d'alternance. M. Ryan agissait comme contrema\u00eetre. Chaque \u00e9quipe \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e au poste de jour pendant deux semaines, puis au poste d'apr\u00e8s-midi durant la troisi\u00e8me semaine. Il est peut-\u00eatre utile d'ajouter que le Dash-80 \u00e9tait le moteur le plus nouveau et le plus perfectionn\u00e9. Aux yeux de certains employ\u00e9s, il s'agissait donc du secteur le plus prestigieux o\u00f9 pouvait travailler un m\u00e9canicien. Au dire de M. Kirby, la r\u00e9affectation \u00e0 la ligne des JD-8 d'un employ\u00e9 travaillant sur la ligne des Dash-80 \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme le signe pr\u00e9curseur d'une punition.\n[29] Lorsqu'un moteur arrivait \u00e0 l'atelier, les planificateurs de l'atelier moteur pr\u00e9paraient un ensemble de bulletins et de commandes de service qu'ils remettaient aux contrema\u00eetres, qui \u00e0 leur tour les distribuaient aux \u00e9quipes. Lorsque les moteurs \u00e9taient d\u00e9mont\u00e9s, les m\u00e9caniciens examinaient chaque constituant ou pi\u00e8ce en vue d'y d\u00e9celer des anomalies. Cette inspection pourrait entra\u00eener la r\u00e9vision de certaines commandes. Le matin, les superviseurs se r\u00e9unissaient avec les contrema\u00eetres et leur remettaient des feuilles de travail \u00e9num\u00e9rant les moteurs \u00e0 r\u00e9parer et les travaux n\u00e9cessaires. Les contrema\u00eetres confiaient ensuite \u00e0 chaque membre de l'\u00e9quipe la r\u00e9paration d'un moteur.\n[30] En outre, les contrema\u00eetres attribuaient \u00e0 certains membres de leur \u00e9quipe, des t\u00e2ches sp\u00e9cifiques, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'une t\u00e2che difficile devait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e sans tarder. Certains travaux \u00e0 accomplir sur la ligne \u00e9taient plus complexes ou techniques que d'autres et pr\u00e9sentaient des d\u00e9fis int\u00e9ressants. C'\u00e9tait le cas notamment de la d\u00e9pose et de la r\u00e9installation de la turbine haute pression (HP), de la turbine basse pression (BP) et du noyau central. Parmi les t\u00e2ches moins difficiles figuraient le calfeutrage, la r\u00e9installation des conduites carburant et la pr\u00e9paration du moteur en vue de sa v\u00e9rification sur le banc d'essai.\n[31] Lorsqu'un m\u00e9canicien se voyait confier un moteur, il effectuait normalement tous les travaux d'entretien n\u00e9cessaires. Toutefois, on attribuait aussi aux m\u00e9caniciens des t\u00e2ches temporaires pour pallier le manque de personnel dans d'autres secteurs de l'atelier. Si le superviseur avait besoin de renfort dans le secteur H, par exemple, il demandait \u00e0 un contrema\u00eetre d'y d\u00e9tacher un de ses m\u00e9caniciens. Il pouvait \u00e9galement affecter un m\u00e9canicien au secteur en question. L'un des t\u00e9moins, Ray Fletcher, a affirm\u00e9 que beaucoup de m\u00e9caniciens \u00e9taient simplement appel\u00e9s \u00e0 terminer le travail entrepris durant le poste de travail pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Les m\u00e9caniciens qui attendaient d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches particuli\u00e8res h\u00e9ritaient souvent des t\u00e2ches dont personne ne voulait.\niii) Le secteur H [32] Un moteur \u00e0 r\u00e9action comporte des soufflantes munies de pales qui sont mont\u00e9es sur un axe central et qui propulsent l'air \u00e0 travers le r\u00e9acteur. Les m\u00e9caniciens du secteur H examinaient les pales de soufflante afin d'y d\u00e9celer des dommages ou des anomalies, limaient les \u00e9raflures et les encoches et v\u00e9rifiaient si les pales \u00e9taient bien \u00e9quilibr\u00e9es. Au moment de notre visite, le secteur \u00e9tait propre et bien \u00e9clair\u00e9; toutefois, on pouvait constater que tous les objets \u00e9taient recouverts d'une fine poussi\u00e8re laiss\u00e9e par les rognures de m\u00e9tal et les r\u00e9sidus chimiques. On a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 lors des t\u00e9moignages que les employ\u00e9s manipulaient dans leur travail des produits chimiques dangereux comme l'iode et l'ac\u00e9tone.\n[33] Les avocats ont d\u00e9battu la question \u00e0 savoir si les travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s dans le secteur H \u00e9taient des t\u00e2ches inf\u00e9rieures. M. Rodominski, qui \u00e9tait reconnu pour ses comp\u00e9tences en m\u00e9canique, a d\u00e9crit ces travaux comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] de nature tr\u00e8s r\u00e9p\u00e9titive et parfois tr\u00e8s ennuyeux . Selon lui, personne ne voulait vraiment travailler l\u00e0. \u00c0 preuve les m\u00e9caniciens affect\u00e9s au secteur H n'\u00e9taient pas soumis au r\u00e9gime d'alternance. Au dire de M. Shelford, il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'un stimulant n\u00e9cessaire pour qu'on puisse compter sur un effectif complet dans ce secteur. Le fait de travailler dans le secteur H comportait cependant certains avantages : on pouvait travailler dans la position assise, on effectuait beaucoup de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire et on \u00e9tait toujours affect\u00e9s au poste de jour. Par cons\u00e9quent, certains m\u00e9caniciens sup\u00e9rieurs y travaillaient en permanence. Comme ces m\u00e9caniciens pouvaient choisir leurs semaines de vacances, le secteur H \u00e9tait \u00e0 court de personnel durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[34] Les avocats de l'intim\u00e9e ont insist\u00e9 sur la valeur des pales de soufflante, qui pouvaient co\u00fbter jusqu'\u00e0 17 000 $ US l'unit\u00e9. Un autre t\u00e9moin, Jay Ghuman, a affirm\u00e9 que les travaux \u00e0 faire sur les pales \u00e9taient importants et exigeants en termes d'effort et devaient \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par quelqu'un de comp\u00e9tent. Si une pale \u00e9tait mal reprofil\u00e9e et pr\u00e9sentait une surface rugueuse ou une fissure capillaire, elle risquait de se rompre, avec les cons\u00e9quences catastrophiques que cela peut comporter pour les voyageurs \u00e0 bord de l'a\u00e9ronef. J'accepte toutes ces observations, qui n'ont toutefois pas rapport \u00e0 la plainte fondamentale de M. Hill, \u00e0 savoir que le travail \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement fastidieux et, partant, inf\u00e9rieur.\n[35] Il n'y a aucun doute dans mon esprit que le secteur H \u00e9tait l'un des moins attrayants. M. Kirby a indiqu\u00e9 qu'une affectation \u00e0 ce secteur pouvait \u00eatre per\u00e7ue comme une forme de punition; il est \u00e9vident qu'un grand nombre de m\u00e9caniciens d\u00e9testaient y travailler. J'admets que les t\u00e2ches \u00e0 cet endroit \u00e9taient inf\u00e9rieures et peu valorisantes. Je puis admettre d'office que le limage de pales m\u00e9talliques, si co\u00fbteuses soient-elles, n'a rien pour exciter les passions d'un m\u00e9canicien.\n[36] Certains t\u00e9moins ont exprim\u00e9 l'avis que la plupart, voire la totalit\u00e9, des m\u00e9caniciens de l'atelier moteur avaient eu des affectations au secteur H. D'autres ont affirm\u00e9 que certains m\u00e9caniciens n'y avaient jamais travaill\u00e9. On a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, par ailleurs, qu'il y avait beaucoup plus de membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles dans des secteurs comme celui du r\u00e9usinage des pales. Selon M. Kirby, cette situation \u00e9tait le reflet de l'injustice au sein du milieu de travail, o\u00f9 les membres des minorit\u00e9s devaient se r\u00e9signer \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches les moins int\u00e9ressantes. Toutefois, M. Fletcher a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles pr\u00e9f\u00e9raient travailler ensemble. La situation peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de diverses fa\u00e7ons.\niv) Le banc d'essai [37] Avant qu'un moteur quitte l'atelier, il fallait v\u00e9rifier s'il r\u00e9pondait aux normes du fabricant et du minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral des Transports. Cette v\u00e9rification \u00e9tait faite sur le banc d'essai. Le moteur \u00e9tait transport\u00e9 depuis l'atelier moteur jusqu'au banc d'essai, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait soulev\u00e9 \u00e0 l'aide de sangles puis install\u00e9 dans un bo\u00eetier afin de permettre aux v\u00e9rificateurs de le d\u00e9marrer et de le laisser fonctionner. Une fois install\u00e9 dans le bo\u00eetier, le moteur \u00e9tait actionn\u00e9 par l'ordinateur, qui simulait les conditions de vol. Il s'agissait d'une t\u00e2che relativement dramatique, qui \u00e9tait gratifiante, car elle permettait de d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e9vision du moteur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien faite. Un v\u00e9rificateur mettait le moteur en marche et observait ce qui se passait, tandis qu'un coll\u00e8gue surveillait les donn\u00e9es communiqu\u00e9es par l'ordinateur pour d\u00e9terminer si les normes en vigueur \u00e9taient respect\u00e9es.\n[38] Trois m\u00e9caniciens agissaient comme v\u00e9rificateurs sur la ligne des Dash-80. Ces m\u00e9caniciens, qui avaient re\u00e7u une formation sp\u00e9ciale, touchaient quinze cents de plus l'heure. Lorsqu'il n'y avait pas de moteurs \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier, ils aidaient le reste de l'\u00e9quipe. Les m\u00e9caniciens qui avaient travaill\u00e9 sur le moteur \u00e9taient eux aussi pr\u00e9sents lors de la v\u00e9rification sur le banc d'essai. Ils aidaient le v\u00e9rificateur \u00e0 sangler le moteur et \u00e0 l'installer dans le bo\u00eetier. Lorsque l'essai \u00e9tait termin\u00e9, ils faisaient les r\u00e9parations n\u00e9cessaires de concert avec le v\u00e9rificateur et aidaient celui-ci \u00e0 enlever les sangles et \u00e0 faire l'inspection finale du moteur. L'accouplement et le d\u00e9saccouplement du moteur constituaient les \u00e9tapes les plus p\u00e9nibles, mais aussi celles qui engageaient le moins leur responsabilit\u00e9.\nC. L'all\u00e9gation de discrimination i) Les t\u00e2ches assign\u00e9es [39] M. Hill avait la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour travailler comme m\u00e9canicien. Cependant, il ne fait aucun doute que son attitude \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son travail chez Canadien laissait beaucoup \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. M. Hill \u00e9tait fermement convaincu qu'il poss\u00e9dait des talents que son employeur n'avait jamais reconnus. Par cons\u00e9quent, il semblait avoir acquis la conviction que certaines t\u00e2ches qu'on lui confiait n'\u00e9taient pas dignes de lui. Devant cette attitude, ses sup\u00e9rieurs en vinrent \u00e0 mettre en doute ses comp\u00e9tentes et aptitudes, ce qui ne fit qu'exacerber son aversion \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du travail qu'ils voulaient lui confier. D'apr\u00e8s certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, il avait tendance \u00e0 fl\u00e2ner et \u00e0 se d\u00e9rober devant ses responsabilit\u00e9s.\n[40] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Hill a affirm\u00e9 que la ligne des 737 chez Canadien \u00e9tait \u00e0 son avis un milieu de travail fonci\u00e8rement raciste. On l'affectait presque toujours aux basses besognes (nettoyage des c\u00e2bles, graissage, r\u00e9glage des engrenages, etc.). L'hostilit\u00e9 a atteint son paroxysme lorsque d'autres m\u00e9caniciens ont dit qu'ils s'\u00e9taient [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9barrass\u00e9s de tous les asiates et pakis et qu'il ne leur restait qu'un n\u00e8gre sur les bras . M. Hill \u00e9tait le dernier \u00e0 qui on offrait de faire du temps suppl\u00e9mentaire. On lui demandait de travailler sous la direction de m\u00e9caniciens qui avaient moins d'anciennet\u00e9 que lui. Aussi a-t-il demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre mut\u00e9 \u00e0 l'atelier moteur.\n[41] \u00c0 l'audience, les parties ont concentr\u00e9 leur attention sur l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Hill a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'atelier moteur. L'all\u00e9gation fondamentale veut que le contrema\u00eetre confiait \u00e0 M. Hill les plus basses besognes. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Kirby a indiqu\u00e9 que M. Ryan l'affectait au r\u00e9usinage, \u00e0 l'inspection et \u00e0 l'\u00e9quilibrage des pales, \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration du banc d'essai et \u00e0 l'installation des pales de soufflante, autant de t\u00e2ches inf\u00e9rieures. Parmi ces t\u00e2ches figuraient le remplacement des filtres et l'accouplement ou le d\u00e9saccouplement des moteurs au banc d'essai. Certaines de ces t\u00e2ches \u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9es de sales besognes. M. Ryan n'affectait M. Hill \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches plus complexes [TRADUCTION] que s'il n'y avait personne d'autre autour . M. Hill a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait travaill\u00e9 dans le secteur H les 23 et 24 ao\u00fbt 1993. Selon lui, les diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9caniciens de l'atelier auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre affect\u00e9s en alternance \u00e0 ce genre de t\u00e2ches.\n[42] Dans une lettre de plainte adress\u00e9e au pr\u00e9sident du syndicat, M. Hill a d\u00e9crit la situation dans les termes suivants :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLes gestionnaires de l'atelier 750 ont r\u00e9cemment exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 mon endroit. Ils ont syst\u00e9matiquement choisi et pistonn\u00e9 certains individus qu'ils d\u00e9crivent comme la cr\u00e8me et qui semblent avoir avec eux certaines affinit\u00e9s. On pistonne ces personnes pour qu'ils obtiennent de l'avancement tandis qu'on d\u00e9courage et laisse dans l'ombre les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles.\nOn confie aux membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles les basses besognes, ce qui sape leur motivation et leur d\u00e9termination. On ne leur offre pas les m\u00eames possibilit\u00e9s de s'am\u00e9liorer et de progresser dans leur carri\u00e8re. Ceux qui font partie de l' \u00e9lite sont encourag\u00e9s \u00e0 persister dans l'ex\u00e9cution des t\u00e2ches techniques ou ax\u00e9es sur la r\u00e9solution de probl\u00e8mes. On les r\u00e9compense en leur donnant de l'avancement au sein de la compagnie. On ne leur confie pas de t\u00e2ches inf\u00e9rieures; on leur demande parfois de prendre la rel\u00e8ve d'un membre d'une minorit\u00e9 visible qui a commenc\u00e9 [sic] une t\u00e2che technique.\nC'est la fa\u00e7on dont M. Ryan a trait\u00e9 M. Hill qui est apparemment \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du syndicat.\n[43] Dans sa lettre au pr\u00e9sident du syndicat, M. Hill a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au secteur H trois fois en deux mois et que cette tendance devrait \u00e9veiller la suspicion. Au regard de la preuve, il est exag\u00e9r\u00e9 de dire, comme le font le plaignant et la Commission, que M. Ryan affectait M. Hill au secteur H [TRADUCTION] la majeure partie du temps . La preuve testimoniale permet simplement d'\u00e9tablir que M. Hill a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au r\u00e9usinage des pales \u00e0 trois ou quatre reprises alors qu'il \u00e9tait sur la ligne des Dash-80. M. Ryan n'a pas admis que M. Hill \u00e9tait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement affect\u00e9 au r\u00e9usinage des pales. Les deux fois o\u00f9 la situation a atteint un point critique, M. Hill s'est dit malade et est rentr\u00e9 chez lui sans terminer son poste de travail.\n[44] L'un de ces cas est survenu le 23 ao\u00fbt 1993, date o\u00f9 M. Hill serait arriv\u00e9 en retard. Selon M. Ryan, M. Hill aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le dernier m\u00e9canicien \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter au travail et aurait, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au r\u00e9usinage des pales. Cette version des faits contredit celle qu'il a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Laurie Ferguson et Hunter Rogers, \u00e0 savoir que M. Hill avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'avant-derni\u00e8re personne arriv\u00e9e au travail. Il est toujours possible qu'une erreur se soit gliss\u00e9e dans le rapport Ferguson-Rogers, mais je crois que l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment important est que le plaignant n'a pas contest\u00e9 le fait qu'il soit arriv\u00e9 en retard. Cela a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 le motif qui a amen\u00e9 M. Ryan \u00e0 d\u00e9tacher ailleurs un employ\u00e9 qui lui donnait du fil \u00e0 retordre.\n[45] Plut\u00f4t que de se rendre au secteur H conform\u00e9ment aux instructions re\u00e7ues, M. Hill est rentr\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison pour cause de maladie, se disant trop stress\u00e9 pour travailler ce jour-l\u00e0. Lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de la situation, le superviseur a dit \u00e0 M. Ryan d'affecter M. Hill au r\u00e9usinage des pales le lendemain. Le jour suivant, M. Hill, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u cet ordre, est rentr\u00e9 chez lui pour cause de maladie et s'est absent\u00e9 du travail durant une semaine. M. Hill \u00e9tait choqu\u00e9 parce qu'il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 t\u00f4t le deuxi\u00e8me jour et a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre que M. Ryan ne suivait pas son propre syst\u00e8me puisqu'il l'affectait au r\u00e9usinage des pales. Selon lui, c'est le dernier arriv\u00e9 qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre affect\u00e9 au r\u00e9usinage des pales.\n[46] L'attitude de M. Hill \u00e9tait fourbe et ne tenait pas compte de l'ensemble de la situation. Il importe de souligner que le plaignant, \u00e0 l'instar de la Commission, ont fait abstraction de l'insubordination \u00e9vidente que d\u00e9notaient ses faits et gestes. Je suis d'avis que la direction ne s'est pas attaqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la situation. La question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le superviseur et le contrema\u00eetre \u00e9taient nettement d'avis que M. Hill feignait d'\u00eatre malade. Ils auraient d\u00fb le convoquer pour lui parler. Quoi qu'il en soit, le diff\u00e9rend v\u00e9ritable entre le plaignant et ses sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e9tait loin de tenir simplement \u00e0 l'affectation au secteur H.\n[47] Les relations entre M. Hill et M. Ryan \u00e9taient tendues, pour dire le moins, et M. Ryan avait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 prompt \u00e0 affecter M. Hill au secteur H. Cependant, si tel \u00e9tait le cas, c'est surtout en raison de l'hostilit\u00e9 qui existait entre les deux hommes plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 cause du fait que M. Hill \u00e9tait de race noire. La preuve sur la question de fond est pour le moins minime, et les probl\u00e8mes entourant la preuve du plaignant sont suffisants pour m'emp\u00eacher de l'accepter sans qu'elle soit \u00e9tay\u00e9e par d'autres t\u00e9moins.\n[48] Le plaignant, \u00e0 l'instar de la Commission, a soutenu que M. Ryan le surveillait plus \u00e9troitement que d'autres employ\u00e9s. Je ne doute pas que c'\u00e9tait le cas, du moins vers la fin, alors que les deux hommes \u00e9taient devenus des adversaires. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9, par exemple, qu'on posait des questions \u00e0 M. Hill lorsqu'il revenait de la salle de bains. S'il se d\u00e9robait devant ses responsabilit\u00e9s, cette fa\u00e7on d'agir \u00e9tait certes tout \u00e0 fait justifi\u00e9e. Je n'admets pas que M. Ryan \u00e9tait malveillant ou inventait des choses. Il y avait des limites \u00e0 son hostilit\u00e9. Il ne fait aucun doute que dans l'esprit de M. Ryan, M. Hill n'\u00e9tait pas un employ\u00e9 fiable et qu'il ne faisait pas sa part. Presque tous les t\u00e9moins ont corrobor\u00e9 ce point. M. Hill avait besoin de surveillance.\n[49] M. Hill a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'on lui avait confi\u00e9 plus que sa juste part de t\u00e2ches peu int\u00e9ressantes, et ce tant sur la ligne que dans les autres secteurs de l'atelier. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il demandait sans cesse de faire du travail plus technique sur la ligne des Dash-80. Il a fourni des exemples \u00e0 l'appui d'une des plaintes dont je suis saisi : le 6 d\u00e9cembre 1993, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un moteur pour lequel il ne restait que des t\u00e2ches inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 accomplir. Le 6 septembre 1994, alors qu'il effectuait du travail technique, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches de bas niveau. Il a fourni un certain nombre d'autres exemples, dont certains n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9s par les feuilles d'affectations sur lesquelles \u00e9taient consign\u00e9s les noms des employ\u00e9s affect\u00e9s aux divers moteurs, feuilles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve.\n[50] Le passage du temps rend la reconstitution des \u00e9v\u00e9nements particuli\u00e8rement plus difficile. Toutefois, une telle accusation devrait \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par des faits concrets, ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Les souvenirs de M. Hill quant \u00e0 ce qui s'est produit sont empreints de partialit\u00e9 et fond\u00e9s sur des impressions; de plus, un grand nombre de situations dont il se plaint pr\u00eatent \u00e0 interpr\u00e9tation. Il ne fait aucun doute qu'il se sentait victime de discrimination; cependant, la preuve que le plaignant et la Commission ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e repose davantage sur des all\u00e9gations que sur des faits. La preuve est de pi\u00e8tre qualit\u00e9, pour dire le moins.\n[51] M. Hill a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que M. Ryan lui donnait de nouveaux bulletins de service apr\u00e8s qu'il eut termin\u00e9 une t\u00e2che et qu'il lui demandait de refaire le travail. Au dire de M. Hill, M. Ryan faisait cela \u00e0 dessein parce qu'il voulait lui compliquer la vie. Les relations entre les deux hommes \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s tendues \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 en raison de la plainte de M. Hill \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Ryan. M. Hill a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait d'instinct recul\u00e9 lorsque M. Ryan avait lanc\u00e9 violemment les feuilles sur le lutrin. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il existait entre les deux hommes une franche hostilit\u00e9. Je ne crois pas M. Hill lorsqu'il affirme que la conduite de M. Ryan n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e. Il ressort de la preuve de M. Hill que celui-ci avait des fa\u00e7ons bien \u00e0 lui de provoquer ses sup\u00e9rieurs imm\u00e9diats.\n[52] D'autres incidents sont dignes de mention, notamment l'entretien de M. Hill avec Jeff Reimer, \u00e0 qui on avait confier la t\u00e2che de renouveler les licences. M. Hill a apostroph\u00e9 M. Reimer \u00e0 l'atelier comme s'il s'agissait d'un infime esclave \u00e0 qui l'on pouvait dicter ses quatre volont\u00e9s. La demande de M. Hill \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en retard. Plut\u00f4t que de s'excuser et de reconna\u00eetre le fait qu'il \u00e9tait en retard, il a entra\u00een\u00e9 M. Reimer dans un \u00e9change virulent. Si M. Reimer ne s'est peut-\u00eatre pas lui-m\u00eame comport\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e en tant que membre de la direction, il n'en reste pas moins que l'attitude de M. Hill \u00e9tait provocatrice et cavali\u00e8re. Il importe de souligner que M. Hill a r\u00e9agi \u00e0 l'incident en se plaignant officiellement de l' attitude de M. Reimer.\n[53] Il y a eu d'autres incidents, dont la conversation que M. Hill a eue avec Jerry Jureidin, un des superviseurs, lorsqu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en train de photocopier des pages d'un manuel. Les m\u00e9caniciens devaient se servir des originaux. D'excellentes raisons militaient en faveur de cette pratique. En outre, M. Hill utilisait le photocopieur sans permission. Plut\u00f4t que de s'excuser, il a adopt\u00e9 une attitude d'indiff\u00e9rence, ce qui a sans doute confirm\u00e9 l'opinion courante voulant qu'il n'acceptait pas l'autorit\u00e9 de ses sup\u00e9rieurs. Ce genre de comportement ne faisait qu'exacerber la situation. Je reconnais que M. Hill estimait \u00eatre dans un milieu d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able, mais je suis persuad\u00e9 que sa conduite est probablement l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment qui a le plus contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er la situation dans laquelle il se trouvait.\n[54] Les plus fortes preuves \u00e0 l'appui des all\u00e9gations de M. Hill ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies par M. Kirby. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Kirby a repris la d\u00e9claration qu'il avait faite \u00e0 Mme Ferguson et \u00e0 M. Hunter, \u00e0 savoir que [TRADUCTION] quiconque entrait dans l'atelier pouvait en moins de cinq minutes s'apercevoir que certains avaient droit \u00e0 un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel . Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Kirby a affirm\u00e9 que M. Ryan n'affectait M. Hill aux t\u00e2ches les plus stimulantes que lorsque personne d'autre n'\u00e9tait disponible. Il a ajout\u00e9 que les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles qui travaillaient dans les ateliers se retrouvaient surtout dans des secteurs \u00e9loign\u00e9s des lignes o\u00f9 s'ex\u00e9cutaient des travaux de m\u00e9canique moins int\u00e9ressants. M. Kirby a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu'on avait tendance \u00e0 affecter beaucoup de membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles \u00e0 des secteurs comme ceux du r\u00e9usinage, de l'inspection et du r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage des pales. Cette observation a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9e par M. Abbing et M. Fletcher. Ce dernier a \u00e9mis l'opinion que les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles voulaient \u00eatre ensemble et, par cons\u00e9quent, gravitaient autour des m\u00eames aires de travail.\n[55] Je comprends pourquoi M. Kirby a formul\u00e9 de telles conclusions, mais ses opinions comportent un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de sp\u00e9culation que je ne puis accepter. Il n'est pas suffisant de faire des all\u00e9gations de discrimination, si sinc\u00e8res soient-elles. Les observations formul\u00e9es par un grand nombre de t\u00e9moins permettent certes de conclure qu'il existait des communaut\u00e9s sociales \u00e0 l'atelier moteur. Toutefois, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 aller plus loin sur la foi des all\u00e9gations. Il serait pr\u00e9somptueux de conclure que la r\u00e9partition des employ\u00e9s entre les divers secteurs de l'atelier \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat d'une attitude manifestement discriminatoire.\n[56] Il ne fait aucun doute qu'un climat de discorde r\u00e9gnait \u00e0 l'atelier et que le racisme y \u00e9tait pour quelque chose. Des t\u00e9moignages comme ceux de MM. Kirby, Hui et Panis ont permis d'\u00e9tablir que, comparativement aux autres m\u00e9caniciens de Canadien, les membres des minorit\u00e9s n'estimaient pas avoir les m\u00eames possibilit\u00e9s. M. Kirby et M. Hibbert ont tous deux affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que les membres des minorit\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient tout simplement pas dans la course pour l'obtention des meilleurs postes \u00e0 l'atelier. Pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par cette question, M. Hibbert avait \u00e9crit en 1988 une lettre de plainte dans laquelle il soulevait des questions semblables \u00e0 celles \u00e9voqu\u00e9es par M. Hill. Les plaintes dont je suis saisi sont de nature personnelle et la preuve d'une discrimination syst\u00e9mique n'est pertinente que dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle permet de situer en contexte ce qui s'est produit dans le cas de M. Hill. Le plaignant et la Commission ont d\u00e9crit les t\u00e9moignages de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme une preuve de faits similaires ; toutefois, la situation de M. Hill semble s'\u00eatre d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e ind\u00e9pendamment de toute tendance \u00e0 la discrimination \u00e0 l'atelier.\nii) La candidature au poste de planificateur III [57] Alors qu'il \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 l'atelier des pneus et freins en 1993, M. Hill a pos\u00e9 sa candidature au poste de planificateur d'a\u00e9ronefs III. On a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 propos de l'affichage de ce poste, du processus de s\u00e9lection, des entrevues, du processus d\u00e9cisionnel et de la r\u00e9action de M. Hill \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision prise. Les t\u00e9moins ont fait deux assertions relativement diff\u00e9rentes. La premi\u00e8re veut que le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection ait tenu pour acquis que le candidat retenu avait les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour le poste, y compris le pouvoir de certification des a\u00e9ronefs (ACA). Il est clair, en r\u00e9trospective, qu'il ne r\u00e9pondait pas \u00e0 cette exigence ou qu'il a obtenu le pouvoir de certification en question apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu le poste, ce qui allait \u00e0 l'encontre de ce qui \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 dans l'affiche.\n[58] La deuxi\u00e8me assertion veut que le comit\u00e9 ait eu de bonnes raisons de rejeter la candidature de M. Hill. M\u00eame s'il avait plus d'anciennet\u00e9 que le candidat choisi, M. Hill ne connaissait pas les fonctions du poste de planificateur III et n'a pas fait bonne figure \u00e0 l'entrevue. Je suis d'avis que le candidat choisi n'aurait pas d\u00fb se voir attribuer le poste, et je soup\u00e7onne qu'il y ait eu des manigances politiques \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Toutefois, je n'admets pas que cette situation ait pu influer sur la candidature de M. Hill. Il n'y a pas de preuves convaincantes que le comit\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9 par le racisme.\n[59] J'ai entendu le t\u00e9moignage de deux membres du comit\u00e9. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Clement, qui \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s fr\u00eale, pose probl\u00e8me. M. Clement s'est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin sinc\u00e8re qui poss\u00e9dait une vaste exp\u00e9rience en gestion; toutefois, il a manifestement modifi\u00e9 ses scores afin de faire des compromis avec les autres membres du comit\u00e9, posant ainsi un geste mal avis\u00e9. Le moins qu'on puisse dire, c'est que ce comportement \u00e9tait inapprori\u00e9. Cela ne signifie pas pour autant que le comit\u00e9 \u00e9tait anim\u00e9 d'une volont\u00e9 de discrimination. Il s'agit de probl\u00e8mes qui rel\u00e8vent de l'application de la convention collective plut\u00f4t que de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne.\n[60] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage de Scott Hunter, l'autre membre du comit\u00e9, qui s'est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin sinc\u00e8re qui, par ailleurs, se souvenait tr\u00e8s bien des faits. M. Hunter a admis tr\u00e8s volontiers que le poste n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 au candidat choisi et a indiqu\u00e9 que le syndicat aurait pu formuler un grief. Cela ne change en rien le fait que M. Hill n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la hauteur lors de l'entrevue. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9, par exemple, s'il voulait le poste, il s'est lanc\u00e9 dans un monologue relativement long au sujet de son ambition de devenir \u00e9crivain. Ce comportement, tout en \u00e9tant non professionnel, n'avait pas sa place dans le cadre d'une entrevue. Voil\u00e0 qui explique sans doute les observations du troisi\u00e8me membre du comit\u00e9, Mme Lange, qui a \u00e9crit sur sa feuille d'\u00e9valuation que M. Hill avait une [TRADUCTION] attitude d\u00e9sinvolte . Je pense qu'il serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 de pr\u00e9tendre que cette observation a \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e par le racisme.\n[61] Le probl\u00e8me que pose la preuve du plaignant est qu'elle ne permet tout simplement pas d'\u00e9tablir que la question raciale a jou\u00e9 dans le processus de s\u00e9lection. Elle r\u00e9v\u00e8le simplement que M. Hill, qui faisait partie d'une minorit\u00e9 raciale, n'a pas obtenu le poste. \u00c0 mon sens, il est juste de pr\u00e9tendre que M. Hill aurait d\u00fb avoir droit \u00e0 un nouveau concours, \u00e0 l'instar des autres candidats, mais la preuve ne renferme gu\u00e8re d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui pourraient m'amener \u00e0 croire qu'il \u00e9tait le meilleur candidat. Cela ressort clairement des scores attribu\u00e9s, et ce m\u00eame si l'on tient compte du probl\u00e8me des feuilles de notation de M. Clement. Je suis tout simplement incapable de voir quelque injustice que ce soit dans le fait que le comit\u00e9 ne lui ait pas accord\u00e9 le poste.\n[62] Il importe de souligner que M. Hill s'est plaint du processus de s\u00e9lection pour le poste de planificateur III et qu'il a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Clement des entrevues. Il s'agissait simplement d'une occasion pour lui de faire de nouvelles all\u00e9gations, qui ne m\u00e9ritent pas d'\u00eatre comment\u00e9es. Dans l'esprit de M. Hill, cela ajoutait n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 son sentiment d'injustice de plus en plus aigu. Je crois qu'il est juste de dire que M. Hill se sentait pers\u00e9cut\u00e9 au regard du d\u00e9roulement des \u00e9v\u00e9nements.\niii) Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 18 octobre 1994 [63] Il ne fait aucun doute que M. Hill se sentait opprim\u00e9 face \u00e0 sa situation \u00e0 l'atelier moteur. Je crois que le fait de ne pas avoir obtenu le poste de planificateur III a \u00e9t\u00e9 une vive d\u00e9ception et a ajout\u00e9 aux pressions \u00e9motives auxquelles il \u00e9tait en proie. De surcro\u00eet, il \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s au plan personnel. Je n'ai point l'intention de minimiser la situation; de toute \u00e9vidence, ce fut pour lui une p\u00e9riode difficile. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, les tensions au travail ont inexorablement atteint leur apog\u00e9e le 18 octobre 1994 dans le bureau du superviseur.\n[64] Certains faits entourant les \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 18 octobre 1994 ne sont pas contest\u00e9s. Le 13 septembre 1994, M. Cavasin a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un m\u00e9mogramme dans lequel il demandait de changer de poste de travail avec M. Hill jusqu'au 15 novembre 1994. Il s'agissait d'une demande inhabituelle puisque M. Cavasin pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait habituellement le poste d'apr\u00e8s-midi et \u00e9changeait volontiers ses postes de jour avec les m\u00e9caniciens qui souhaitaient continuer d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9s au poste de jour. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que sa femme \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait dans les circonstances le poste de jour. Il appert que les m\u00e9caniciens s'\u00e9changeaient fr\u00e9quemment des postes de travail et que cette demande n'avait rien d'inusit\u00e9.\n[65] En raison de ce changement de poste de travail, M. Hill a travaill\u00e9 le 18 octobre 1994 durant le poste d'apr\u00e8s-midi. Toutefois, au dire de M. Hill, M. Cavasin et lui auraient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le 17 ou le 18 de revenir \u00e0 leur poste de travail original. Je suis enclin \u00e0 croire que l'instigateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 M. Hill, bien que ce dernier ait indiqu\u00e9 qu'il voulait rendre service \u00e0 M. Cavasin. M. Hill a n\u00e9anmoins pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un m\u00e9mogramme le 17 octobre 1994 pour demander de revenir le lendemain au poste de jour. Il demandait dans cette note de retirer la note pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\n[66] Il importe \u00e0 mon avis de pr\u00e9ciser, pour comprendre la dimension psychologique de la situation, que le m\u00e9mo devait \u00eatre approuv\u00e9. Ce fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 quelque peu contest\u00e9 mais, en derni\u00e8re analyse, la direction avait le droit de refuser la demande. Il appert que les m\u00e9caniciens, qui pr\u00e9f\u00e9raient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le poste de jour, avaient abus\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de changer de poste de travail, et que trois ou quatre m\u00e9caniciens avaient parfois pr\u00e9tendu avoir chang\u00e9 de poste avec M. Cavasin. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette question \u00e9tait d\u00e9licate.\n[67] Le 18 octobre 1994, pour une raison que personne n'a pu vraiment expliquer, l'un et l'autre se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour le poste de jour. Bien que la preuve n'ait pas permis d'\u00e9tablir qui \u00e9tait en faute, je soup\u00e7onne que M. Hill n'avait pas inform\u00e9 M. Cavasin du m\u00e9mo qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la veille, ou que celui-ci n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9. Le fait que M. Ryan ait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hill pourquoi il se pr\u00e9sentait pour le poste de jour est \u00e9loquent. M. Hill a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un m\u00e9mo demandant un changement de poste de travail.\n[68] M. Ryan a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hill de parler \u00e0 M. Strohmaier et \u00e0 M. Jureidin, qui \u00e9taient tous les deux des superviseurs. Ces derniers lui ont simplement demand\u00e9 de faire signer par M. Cavasin le m\u00e9mo de la veille. Il semble y avoir eu une certaine confusion quant \u00e0 savoir si M. Cavasin avait chang\u00e9 de poste de travail avec M. Hill ou quelqu'un d'autre. Quelque chose ne fonctionnait pas, pour dire le moins. Lorsque M. Hill a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le m\u00e9mo \u00e0 M. Cavasin, ce dernier l'a sign\u00e9 et y a inscrit la note sarcastique suivante : [TRADUCTION] Pourquoi me le dire . Cela semble appuyer la th\u00e8se voulant que M. Cavasin n'\u00e9tait pas tout \u00e0 fait au courant du changement de poste.\n[69] \u00c0 mon avis, l'explication des \u00e9v\u00e9nements que M. Cavasin a donn\u00e9e est logique. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait inscrit un [TRADUCTION] commentaire retors sur le premier document pour [TRADUCTION] saboter un peu le m\u00e9mo . Il voulait [TRADUCTION] en quelque sorte le mettre un peu en rogne car, vous savez, on se jouait pas mal de tours . Quoi qu'il en soit, M. Cavasin voulait contraindre M. Hill \u00e0 r\u00e9diger un autre m\u00e9mo et \u00e0 revenir pour une deuxi\u00e8me signature. M. Hill a invers\u00e9 les r\u00f4les en se rendant avec le m\u00e9mo dans le bureau du superviseur, au grand dam de ses sup\u00e9rieurs.\n[70] Apr\u00e8s qu'on lui eut demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9diger un autre m\u00e9mo et d'obtenir la signature appropri\u00e9e, M. Hill est retourn\u00e9 voir M. Cavasin qui, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, a dit ne pas avoir cru que M. Hill avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le premier m\u00e9mo aux superviseurs. Je ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de penser que M. Cavasin \u00e9prouvait peut-\u00eatre envers M. Hill du ressentiment parce qu'il avait chang\u00e9 de poste de travail \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens. Sur le deuxi\u00e8me m\u00e9mo, M. Hill a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Ross C. et moi aimerions revenir \u00e0 notre poste de travail habituel \u00e0 compter de maintenant. Lorsque M. Hill est retourn\u00e9 voir M. Cavasin, ce dernier a sign\u00e9 le m\u00e9mo mais n'a pu s'abstenir d'y inscrire un autre commentaire sarcastique : [TRADUCTION] N'est-ce pas normal?\n[71] Il est \u00e9vident que ce man\u00e8ge a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de temps. Ayant vu l'atelier, il est clair \u00e0 mes yeux qu'il aurait normalement suffi d'une dizaine de minutes pour traiter les deux m\u00e9mos. Les superviseurs ont apparemment cru que c'\u00e9tait M. Hill qui avait inscrit les commentaires, mais ils l'ont autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 continuer de travailler durant le poste de jour. Pendant la matin\u00e9e, M. Ryan s'est plaint \u00e0 ses superviseurs que M. Hill ne travaillait pas fort. D'apr\u00e8s la preuve, le contrema\u00eetre de M. Cavasin se serait plaint lui aussi. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il y avait un certain fl\u00e2nage et niaisage de la part de M. Hill et de M. Cavasin, situation qui irritait les contrema\u00eetres. Vers 12 h 30, M. Cavasin et M. Hill ont \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 une r\u00e9union avec M. Jureidin, M. Strohmaier et M. Abbing, un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical.\n[72] Je n'admets pas que M. Hill se d\u00e9peigne comme un participant passif \u00e0 ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements. De toute \u00e9vidence, le m\u00e9mo initial n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9; comme c'est M. Hill qui demandait le changement, c'est \u00e0 lui qu'il incombait d'obtenir la signature de M. Cavasin. En outre, il est \u00e9vident qu'il \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 rus\u00e9 et perspicace et qu'il savait qu'il attisait le feu en retournant les m\u00e9mos qui comportaient des commentaires sarcastiques de son confr\u00e8re. Les deux hommes avaient la r\u00e9putation de ne pas respecter l'autorit\u00e9 et tout gestionnaire responsable se serait senti oblig\u00e9 de leur rappeler la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre.\n[73] Une fois la question des changements de poste r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, M. Jureidin s'est attaqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la question du bavardage. Lorsque le contrema\u00eetre de M. Cavasin est pass\u00e9 pr\u00e8s du bureau, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 de se joindre au groupe. Devant les \u00e9normes pressions exerc\u00e9es par M. Cavasin, il a ni\u00e9 s'\u00eatre plaint aux superviseurs. On a ensuite parl\u00e9 de M. Ryan, qu'on a averti \u00e0 l'aide de son t\u00e9l\u00e9avertisseur pour lui demander de venir \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. M. Hill et M. Ryan se sont alors livr\u00e9s \u00e0 une engueulade qui a eu vite fait de prendre des proportions gigantesques. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Cavasin a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que M. Ryan [TRADUCTION] est entr\u00e9 dans le bureau, puis je ne me souviens plus trop du reste mais \u00e7a a bard\u00e9 .\n[74] Le bureau en question \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement exigu, et on peut facilement imaginer la sc\u00e8ne. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, M. Hill a dit \u00e0 M. Ryan de v\u00e9rifier ses faits puis est sorti du bureau en claquant la porte. M. Cavasin a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les deux hommes en \u00e9taient presque venus aux coups, tout en pr\u00e9cisant qu'ils se seraient battus si M. Hill n'avait pas quitt\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce. M. Hill est all\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement au bureau de M. Shelford pour discuter de l'affaire avec lui. Voyant bien que M. Hill \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement boulevers\u00e9, M. Shelford lui a donn\u00e9 l'autorisation de rentrer chez lui. M. Hill n'est pas retourn\u00e9 travailler chez Canadien.\nD. L'all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement [75] On a discut\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience de ce qu'est le racisme. Je souscris \u00e0 l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par le plaignant et la Commission, qui ont fait valoir que, souvent, les membres des groupes dominants de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne voient pas l'existence de la discrimination et du harc\u00e8lement. Les avocats m'ont cit\u00e9 un extrait du paragraphe 44 de la d\u00e9cision Naraine v. Ford Motor Co. of Canada (No. 4), (1985) 27 C.H.R.R. 230 (commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario), o\u00f9 l'on peut lire que la commission d'enqu\u00eate a reconnu que les membres des minorit\u00e9s raciales poss\u00e8dent souvent [TRADUCTION] une certaine expertise en la mati\u00e8re, ayant c\u00f4toy\u00e9 pendant longtemps des membres de la majorit\u00e9 qui sont tyranniques et pleins de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s. \u00c0 mon avis, il ne faut pas perdre de vue ce principe de pr\u00e9caution lorsqu'on examine le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins dans une affaire fond\u00e9e sur une all\u00e9gation de racisme, et ce \u00e0 plus forte raison dans un cas de harc\u00e8lement.\n[76] Dans sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement, M. Hill a donn\u00e9 cinq exemples de graffitis racistes qu'il a vus sur les murs des salles de bains. Parmi ceux-ci figuraient la croix gamm\u00e9e et des d\u00e9clarations comme [TRADUCTION] Mort \u00e0 tous les N\u00e8gres et [TRADUCTION] Les n\u00e8gres ne sont pas mauvais; tout le monde devrait en avoir un. Tous les t\u00e9moins ont convenu qu'il y avait des graffitis sur les murs des salles de bains chez Canadien. Il y avait notamment des commentaires sexuels m\u00e9prisants ou racistes et des propos diffamants. La preuve d\u00e9montre que les graffitis sexuels \u00e9taient pr\u00e9dominants, bien que les commentaires racistes faisaient partie de la probl\u00e9matique. La question \u00e9tait suffisamment inqui\u00e9tante pour que M. Shelford, le directeur des installations de motopropulsion, fasse certains efforts pour corriger la situation. Il a notamment fait peindre les murs en noir, strat\u00e9gie qui, \u00e0 long terme, n'a apparemment pas donn\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats escompt\u00e9s. On a \u00e9galement install\u00e9 dans les salles de bains des tableaux blancs afin de pallier le probl\u00e8me. La seule solution v\u00e9ritable semblait \u00eatre de repeindre constamment les salles de bains, mais les restrictions financi\u00e8res emp\u00eachaient la compagnie de le faire tr\u00e8s souvent.\n[77] M. Hill a \u00e9galement fourni cinq exemples de plaisanteries racistes qui ont circul\u00e9 \u00e0 l'atelier moteur et dont la teneur est sans \u00e9quivoque :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00ab Le chemin de fer a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit par des n\u00e8gres et des chinetoques parce que les propri\u00e9taires ne voulaient pas utiliser des mules pour transporter la nitroglyc\u00e9rine. - dixit un coll\u00e8gue, en 1992.\nComment fait-on pour garder des n\u00e9grillons? Eh bien, vous leur humectez les l\u00e8vres et vous les collez au plafond. - dixit Kerry Ryan, mon contrema\u00eetre, au printemps de 1993.\nGeorge Lenihan a racont\u00e9 une histoire au sujet d'une sortie entre amis o\u00f9 il s'agissait de frapper des Noirs avec des manches \u00e0 balai depuis la caisse d'une camionnette; il a qualifi\u00e9 ce jeu de chasse aux n\u00e8gres \u00bb.\nJe ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que Kerry Ryan ait racont\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me plaisanterie, mais quelqu'un d'autre l'a peut-\u00eatre fait. J'admets volontiers cependant que les m\u00e9caniciens tentaient de voler la vedette en racontant des plaisanteries m\u00e9prisantes et de mauvais go\u00fbt.\n[78] Dans la plainte, il est \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que M. Ryan a appel\u00e9 M. Hill Nig Nog \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Selon M. Kirby, c'\u00e9tait une fa\u00e7on subtile de le qualifier de n\u00e8gre. Ce n'est que lors du t\u00e9moignage de M. Ryan que l'on a compris le double sens de ce terme. M. Ryan a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il l'avait employ\u00e9 en parlant \u00e0 ses enfants. Il a produit une d\u00e9finition provenant d'Internet pour expliquer qu'il s'agissait d'un terme employ\u00e9 dans le Lancashire [TRADUCTION] pour indiquer qu'on d\u00e9sapprouve les faits et gestes de quelqu'un . Selon son interpr\u00e9tation, ce terme signifiait simplement idiot et n'avait pas de connotation raciste.\n[79] Je suis perplexe vis-\u00e0-vis des intentions qui animaient M. Ryan lorsqu'il a employ\u00e9 le terme Nig Nog , mais j'ai l'impression que l'interpr\u00e9tation de M. Kirby est logique. Je ne suis pas vraiment convaincu que M. Ryan parlait avec ses enfants et M. Hill de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, d'autant plus qu'on avait tendance \u00e0 l'atelier \u00e0 utiliser un langage cru. Je ne vois pas trop pourquoi il lui aurait fallu employer des \u00e9pith\u00e8tes. J'accepte n\u00e9anmoins l'affirmation de M. Ryan voulant qu'il n'ait pas employ\u00e9 ce terme apr\u00e8s que M. Hill eut mis en doute sa signification. L'assertion de M. Hill selon laquelle M. Ryan a continu\u00e9 d'utiliser le terme [TRADUCTION] presque chaque fois qu'il m'adressait la parole n'est pas cr\u00e9dible \u00e0 mon avis.\n[80] L'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve le plus inqui\u00e9tant en ce qui concerne le harc\u00e8lement a trait \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode que M. Hill a pass\u00e9e sur la ligne des 737, dans le secteur appel\u00e9 hangar . Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Hill a indiqu\u00e9 que les plaisanteries au sujet des [TRADUCTION] n\u00e8gres, gooks, pakis, etc., \u00e9taient monnaie courante . Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'on s'employait constamment \u00e0 d\u00e9nigrer la race noire. Gordy White, un autre m\u00e9canicien, le qualifiait toujours de n\u00e8gre. La preuve ind\u00e9pendante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est mince. Il se peut que M. Hill ait exag\u00e9r\u00e9, mais j'admets qu'on avait recours \u00e0 un langage raciste. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Cavasin a indiqu\u00e9 que les m\u00e9caniciens se traitent encore les uns les autres de wops , de polacks et de flips . Il a \u00e9tabli une distinction entre ces sobriquets et les insultes racistes; toutefois, je ne crois pas que l'environnement social entourant la ligne des Dash-80 soit comparable \u00e0 la situation qui existait sur la ligne des 737.\n[81] J'ai le regret de dire qu'il existait un manque de respect g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'atelier. Un des probl\u00e8mes dans le cas de M. Hill est qu'on a fourni des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve indiquant qu'il participait au harc\u00e8lement qui avait cours \u00e0 l'atelier moteur. Cette attitude cadrait avec son ressentiment g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'autorit\u00e9. Ainsi, M. Ghuman a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Hill surnommait un autre m\u00e9canicien [TRADUCTION] vieille paire de t\u00e9tons . M. Hill utilisait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ce surnom lorsqu'il s'adressait \u00e0 cet employ\u00e9, qui \u00e0 son tour l'affublait de divers sobriquets. M. Ghuman a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage [TRADUCTION] qu'ils cherchaient \u00e0 se rabaisser mutuellement . Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que M. Hill traitait ouvertement un autre employ\u00e9 de pelote d\u00e9bile , surnom qui faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'anatomie f\u00e9minine.\n[82] On a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve le formulaire d'\u00e9valuation du rendement de Canadien. M. Hill a r\u00e9pondu en termes \u00e9vasifs et \u00e9quivoques lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 s'il avait rempli ce formulaire, se contentant d'indiquer que l'\u00e9criture ressemblait \u00e0 la sienne. Il a finalement admis \u00e0 contrecoeur qu'il avait rempli le formulaire, mais il a minimis\u00e9 ses faits et gestes. Le formulaire semble \u00eatre une r\u00e9plique d'un dossier du personnel \u00e9tabli au nom de Gordie White. On peut lire sur ce formulaire que l'emploi de M. White est [TRADUCTION] fourreur de chiens . M. Hill a coch\u00e9 certaines inscriptions figurant sur le formulaire, notamment les suivantes :\n[TRADUCTION]\nFait un travail de merde et fout constamment la merde.\nNe travaille que si on lui botte souvent le cul.\nEst tellement stupide qu'il ne peut distinguer la merde de la merdouille.\nAttitude de merde - pense qu'on lui chie toujours dessus.\nVoil\u00e0 un exemple des \u00e9changes crus et banals qui avaient cours \u00e0 l'atelier.\n[83] Il est important de souligner, dans le contexte du harc\u00e8lement, que Canadien avait une politique sur le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail. Cette politique visait notamment \u00e0 sensibiliser les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 d'un tel comportement. Bien qu'on ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve donnant \u00e0 croire que les employ\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas au courant de cette politique, je crois que la culture de travail \u00e9tait en voie d'\u00e9voluer \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Hill travaillait \u00e0 l'atelier moteur. Il ne fait aucun doute que la plainte de M. Hill a peut-\u00eatre contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9volution; en effet, le rapport Ferguson-Rogers, le rapport de Mme Knorr et les directives donn\u00e9es par M. Shelford ont \u00e9t\u00e9 autant d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont favoris\u00e9 la prise de conscience que les commentaires racistes n'\u00e9taient plus acceptables.\n[84] D'autres faits ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cette situation. C'est le cas notamment des tentatives initiales et plut\u00f4t malheureuses de l'employeur pour d\u00e9terminer la r\u00e9partition des membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles au sein de l'atelier. En outre, on offrait une formation sur le harc\u00e8lement, du moins au syndicat, et la preuve a permis d'\u00e9tablir que la compagnie s'est efforc\u00e9e par la suite de veiller \u00e0 ce que l'on offre des possibilit\u00e9s d'avancement aux membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles.\nE. Les griefs du plaignant et les enqu\u00eates internes i) Le premier grief [85] Les questions soulev\u00e9es dans les deux plaintes dont je suis saisi ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation par le plaignant de trois griefs en vertu de la convention collective. Le premier grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 1er septembre 1993 aux termes de l'article 39 de la convention collective, qui portait sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel et personnel; la question de la pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 l'avancement y \u00e9tait \u00e9galement soulev\u00e9e. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait \u00e9tat de la lettre dans laquelle M. Hill all\u00e9guait que certains m\u00e9caniciens \u00e9taient pr\u00e9par\u00e9s \u00e0 des promotions et que d'autres \u00e9taient laiss\u00e9s de c\u00f4t\u00e9 en raison de leur race. M. Hill affirmait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles ne se voyaient pas confier [TRADUCTION] de t\u00e2ches ou de probl\u00e8mes de nature \u00e0 leur permettre d'am\u00e9liorer leurs comp\u00e9tences pour qu'ils puissent satisfaire aux crit\u00e8res d'avancement . Il demandait donc qu'on fasse enqu\u00eate l\u00e0-dessus et qu'on mette sur pied un programme pour aider et encourager les membres des minorit\u00e9s \u00e0 postuler des emplois comportant plus de responsabilit\u00e9s.\n[86] \u00c0 la suite du grief du plaignant, un comit\u00e9 form\u00e9 de Hunter Rogers et de Laurie Ferguson, qui repr\u00e9sentaient la direction et le syndicat, a examin\u00e9 la situation qui r\u00e9gnait \u00e0 l'atelier moteur. Au cours de leur enqu\u00eate, M. Rogers et Mme Ferguson ont interrog\u00e9 M. Hill, M. Ryan et un certain nombre de m\u00e9caniciens. Ils ont produit un rapport \u00e9non\u00e7ant leurs conclusions dont ils ont termin\u00e9 la r\u00e9daction en octobre 1993 et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience (pi\u00e8ce C-1.13).\n[87] Le rapport \u00e9nonce trois conclusions importantes. La premi\u00e8re se lit comme suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nNous croyons qu'il y a bel et bien eu du harc\u00e8lement dans ce secteur, mais il est tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 notre avis d'attribuer cette situation \u00e0 un individu particulier.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me conclusion a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition des t\u00e2ches :\n[TRADUCTION]\nL'attribution des t\u00e2ches \u00e0 l'atelier est une autre question. Il existe une perception voulant que les t\u00e2ches ne soient pas r\u00e9parties \u00e9galement et qu'on aille m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 choisir certains individus \u00e0 des fins d'avancement, mais les faits \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard ne sont pas concluants. Toutefois, on ne semble pas suffisamment sensible aux pr\u00e9occupations des employ\u00e9s et on n'a pas vraiment pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le mode de r\u00e9partition des t\u00e2ches.\nCela demeure un litige entre les parties.\n[88] La troisi\u00e8me conclusion \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans le rapport Ferguson-Rogers d\u00e9note la baisse de moral chez Canadien durant la p\u00e9riode en question :\n[TRADUCTION]\nIl semble exister \u00e0 l'atelier un malaise g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui se traduit par des comportements inacceptables. Les employ\u00e9s arrivent en retard au travail, prennent de longues pauses-caf\u00e9 et rechignent lorsqu'on leur confie des t\u00e2ches plut\u00f4t fastidieuses. Ils font des plaisanteries et des commentaires que certains employ\u00e9s trouvent offensants, mais on ne fait rien pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation. On pr\u00e9f\u00e8re fermer les yeux plut\u00f4t que le r\u00e9gler. Une telle approche ne contribue en rien \u00e0 le r\u00e9gler. Cela ne fait qu'empoisonner le climat.\nL'id\u00e9e est que les probl\u00e8mes qui persistaient au sein de la compagnie \u00e9taient suffisants en soi pour empoisonner le climat de travail.\n[89] Mme Ferguson et M. Rogers formulent trois recommandations \u00e0 la fin du rapport :\nOn devrait \u00e9tablir un syst\u00e8me juste et \u00e9quitable d'attribution des t\u00e2ches. On devrait sensibiliser les employ\u00e9s au fait qu'on ne tol\u00e9rera pas les commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants ou les insultes racistes dans le milieu de travail. Tout comportement de cette nature va \u00e0 l'encontre de la politique de la compagnie et de la loi. On devrait rappeler aux employ\u00e9s du secteur qu'il existe un [programme d'aide aux employ\u00e9s] et des services dont ils peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier durant la p\u00e9riode stressante que nous traversons.\nLe rapport \u00e9tait adress\u00e9 \u00e0 John Madden, directeur, Soutien des employ\u00e9s.\n[90] Me Fakirani a contest\u00e9 le rapport Ferguson-Rogers. Il a soutenu que ce n'\u00e9tait pas une \u00e9tude approfondie, que ses conclusions \u00e9taient trompeuses et qu'on n'y traitait pas des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es par le plaignant. En outre, les avocats du plaignant et de la Commission ont fait valoir que les auteurs du rapport n'avaient pas respect\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par la convention collective. L'intim\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] se tra\u00eenait les pieds . Cependant, il est facile de trouver \u00e0 redire sur les d\u00e9tails du rapport et de fermer les yeux sur l'essentiel. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je crois que le rapport constituait une tentative sinc\u00e8re pour s'attaquer \u00e0 l'essence m\u00eame du grief de M. Hill.\n[91] L'avocat a indiqu\u00e9 que les auteurs du rapport n'avaient pas compris l'obligation que la l\u00e9gislation impose \u00e0 l'employeur et qu'ils ont fait l'erreur de chercher des exemples de racisme d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que de racisme institutionnel. Ce sont l\u00e0 toutefois des questions de droit et on doit s'attacher au caract\u00e8re factuel du rapport. Mme Ferguson et M. Rogers semblent s'\u00eatre efforc\u00e9s de donner \u00e0 tous les individus concern\u00e9s une occasion raisonnable de pr\u00e9senter leur version des faits. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, ils ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 de s'entretenir avec ces personnes avant d'avoir la chance d'examiner les cons\u00e9quences de ce qu'ils avaient constat\u00e9. Je crois que le rapport Ferguson-Rogers donne une bonne id\u00e9e de la situation qui r\u00e9gnait \u00e0 l'atelier moteur.\n[92] Quels que soient les lacunes dont le rapport est entach\u00e9, le constat de discrimination fait par Mme Ferguson et M. Rogers \u00e9tait quelque peu \u00e9quivoque. Selon Me Fakirani, cela aurait d\u00fb donner l'alarme et faire prendre conscience \u00e0 Canadien de la gravit\u00e9 de la situation. La partie adverse a fait valoir que c'est exactement ce qui s'est produit. Le 3 novembre 1993, M. Madden a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Hill. Dans sa lettre, il \u00e9nonce ses propres recommandations relativement \u00e0 la mise en \u009cuvre du rapport :\nQu'un syst\u00e8me juste et \u00e9quitable d'attribution des t\u00e2ches soit mis sur pied et annonc\u00e9 par M. Shelford. Que M. Shelford sensibilise les dirigeants de l'atelier moteur \u00e0 leur responsabilit\u00e9 d'assurer un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement. Que M. Shelford sensibilise les employ\u00e9s au fait qu'on ne tol\u00e9rera ni les commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants ni les insultes racistes.\n\u00c0 titre de directeur, M. Shelford \u00e9tait responsable en dernier ressort de l'ensemble des op\u00e9rations de l'atelier moteur.\n[93] M. Madden a transmis une copie de sa lettre \u00e0 M. Shelford, qui a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait mis en \u009cuvre de diverses fa\u00e7ons les deux premi\u00e8res recommandations. Il a notamment abord\u00e9 la question du harc\u00e8lement avec les superviseurs. Il a \u00e9galement discut\u00e9 de ce sujet \u00e0 des r\u00e9unions du personnel et ordonn\u00e9 que la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement soit affich\u00e9e au babillard. Les indicateurs quant \u00e0 la sensibilisation des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la question \u00e9taient mixtes, mais on peut comprendre que certains t\u00e9moins ne se souvenaient pas de ce genre de choses plusieurs ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s le fait. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage de M. Shelford et je conclus qu'il a abord\u00e9 la question tant avec ses superviseurs qu'avec les employ\u00e9s en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. M. Hill a contest\u00e9 cette assertion; toutefois, son dossier de pr\u00e9sence \u00e9tait tel qu'il se peut qu'il ait rat\u00e9 les r\u00e9unions et je ne vois aucune raison de ne pas croire M. Shelford.\n[94] Le plaignant et la Commission ont fait valoir que la participation \u00e0 toute r\u00e9union aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre obligatoire, mais Canadien \u00e9tait dans une situation financi\u00e8re d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e et la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas eu de probl\u00e8me de participation, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient \u00e0 l'aff\u00fbt de renseignements au sujet de la compagnie. Bien qu'il n'ait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait au courant de la situation qui r\u00e9gnait entre M. Hill et M. Ryan, M. Shelford a fait \u00e0 mon avis des efforts consciencieux pour mettre en \u009cuvre les recommandations de M. Madden.\n[95] Reste la question \u00e0 savoir si le syst\u00e8me d'attribution des t\u00e2ches \u00e0 l'atelier \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Nous touchons ici au c\u009cur m\u00eame de la plainte de discrimination. La Commission et le plaignant ont soutenu que M. Shelford n'avait pas pris la chose au s\u00e9rieux. \u00c0 mon avis, ce jugement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Shelford n'est pas tout \u00e0 fait juste, m\u00eame si j'admets volontiers que M. Shelford, M. Strohmaier et d'autres cadres ne croyaient pas que le syst\u00e8me d'attribution des t\u00e2ches \u00e9tait injuste ou in\u00e9quitable. \u00c0 leur avis, les t\u00e2ches devaient \u00eatre attribu\u00e9s en fonction des priorit\u00e9s de la journ\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, chaque superviseur ou contrema\u00eetre devait tenir compte des comp\u00e9tences et de l'exp\u00e9rience des divers m\u00e9caniciens sous ses ordres et d\u00e9cider de fa\u00e7on subjective \u00e0 qui devait \u00eatre confi\u00e9e telle ou telle t\u00e2che. Comme cette pratique \u00e9tait en place, ils estimaient par cons\u00e9quent qu'il existait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une m\u00e9thode juste et \u00e9quitable d'attribution des t\u00e2ches.\n[96] M. Shelford a r\u00e9agi \u00e0 la recommandation en demandant \u00e0 la coordonnatrice de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en emploi de la compagnie, Marjorie Knorr, d'enqu\u00eater sur la fa\u00e7on dont le travail \u00e9tait r\u00e9parti \u00e0 l'atelier moteur. Le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1994, Mme Knorr s'est donc rendue \u00e0 l'atelier moteur pour s'enqu\u00e9rir du syst\u00e8me d'attribution des t\u00e2ches. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, les parties ne s'entendent pas sur la question \u00e0 savoir s'il existait un syst\u00e8me valable. Je ne crois pas qu'on ait beaucoup \u00e0 gagner en ajoutant au d\u00e9bat des avocats quant \u00e0 savoir si la pratique suivie par les contrema\u00eetres et les superviseurs pour l'attribution des t\u00e2ches temporaires r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de syst\u00e8me . Il est peut-\u00eatre plus important de dire qu'il s'agissait d'un syst\u00e8me officieux plut\u00f4t que d'un syst\u00e8me en bonne et due forme et que les cadres jouissaient d'une grande latitude dans l'attribution du travail. Je suis n\u00e9anmoins d'avis qu'il existait un syst\u00e8me, une fa\u00e7on plus ou moins \u00e9tablie de faire les choses, qui laissait cependant place \u00e0 l'improvisation et faisait appel au jugement personnel des contrema\u00eetres et des superviseurs.\n[97] Mme Knorr a pass\u00e9 \u00e0 l'atelier moteur un apr\u00e8s-midi, au cours duquel elle s'est pench\u00e9e sur le syst\u00e8me d'attribution des t\u00e2ches temporaires de concert avec les superviseurs et les contrema\u00eetres, qui lui ont apparemment montr\u00e9 la documentation pertinente et expliqu\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'attribuer le travail. Elle a consacr\u00e9 toute son attention au syst\u00e8me et ne s'est pas entretenue avec des m\u00e9caniciens. Je ne partage pas l'opinion de M. Hill que Mme Knorr \u00e9tait l'otage de la direction et je ne doute pas qu'elle ait men\u00e9 son enqu\u00eate de fa\u00e7on sinc\u00e8re et consciencieuse. Mme Knorr a ensuite r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un rapport relativement impromptu \u00e0 l'intention de M. Shelford (pi\u00e8ce C-1.20). Dans ce rapport, elle a conclu que le syst\u00e8me n'\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire. Toutefois, elle a admis lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il pouvait pr\u00eater \u00e0 certains abus de la part des contrema\u00eetres.\n[98] Dans son rapport en date du 10 mars 1994, Mme Knorr a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les contrema\u00eetres attribuaient les t\u00e2ches en fonction de divers crit\u00e8res dont les suivants :\n\u00b7 les employ\u00e9s les plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s et productifs se voient confier les t\u00e2ches urgentes ;\n\u00b7 les employ\u00e9s nouveaux ou inexp\u00e9riment\u00e9s sont jumel\u00e9s \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s ayant plus d'exp\u00e9rience;\n\u00b7 les employ\u00e9s peu motiv\u00e9s font \u00e9quipe avec des employ\u00e9s motiv\u00e9s;\n\u00b7 aux fins de l'attribution des t\u00e2ches les moins int\u00e9ressantes, on a recours \u00e0 diverses m\u00e9thodes; l'\u00e9quipe d\u00e9termine \u00e0 qui c'est le tour, on joue \u00e0 pile ou face ou on attribue la t\u00e2che \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 qui arrive le dernier au travail.\n[99] Mme Knorr a conclu que le travail \u00e9tait attribu\u00e9 surtout en fonction du rendement, tel que per\u00e7u, bien s\u00fbr, par les contrema\u00eetres. L'opinion que les contrema\u00eetres avaient des membres de leur \u00e9quipe influait de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9terminante sur l'attribution des t\u00e2ches particuli\u00e8rement techniques ou exigeantes.\n[100] Mme Knorr a \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9terminer qui allait recevoir une formation. Elle n'a trouv\u00e9 aucune preuve de discrimination. \u00c0 son avis, il n'y avait pas de raison de mener une enqu\u00eate plus approfondie sur la r\u00e9partition du travail ou la formation. Elle a transmis son rapport \u00e0 M. Shelford, qui en a fait tenir un exemplaire aux superviseurs de l'atelier moteur. Les contrema\u00eetres de l'atelier ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sensibilis\u00e9s aux pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l'origine du rapport. Bien qu'il y ait eu des tentatives pour clarifier et am\u00e9liorer le syst\u00e8me d'attribution des t\u00e2ches, il est normal que les gestionnaires aient jug\u00e9 que le rapport les avait blanchis.\n[101] Les avocats ont fait valoir que le rapport Knorr, \u00e0 l'instar du rapport Ferguson-Rogers, \u00e9tait lacunaire. Selon eux, si on n'avait pas trouv\u00e9 de preuve de discrimination, c'est parce que Mme Knorr n'avait pas examin\u00e9 la question en profondeur. Cette r\u00e9ponse que semble servir le plaignant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de maintes lacunes que comporte la preuve ne nous aide strictement en rien. La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 est que j'ai le choix entre la preuve du plaignant et celle de nombreux t\u00e9moins plus fiables. J'accepte la d\u00e9claration suivante de Mme Knorr :\n[TRADUCTION]\neu \u00e9gard aux changements de poste de travail ou d'\u00e9quipe, \u00e0 l'\u00e9vincement, \u00e0 la nature des emplois, aux circonstances et aux cong\u00e9s de maladie, ainsi qu'\u00e0 la diversit\u00e9 des priorit\u00e9s, je crois qu'il serait tr\u00e8s difficile d'user de pratiques discriminatoires dans l'attribution des t\u00e2ches.\nAu dire de la Commission et du plaignant, cela ne fait que prouver que le travail \u00e9tait attribu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on arbitraire et, partant, discriminatoire; toutefois, il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une interpr\u00e9tation forc\u00e9e de son t\u00e9moignage qui ne plaide pas en faveur du plaignant.\n[102] Le plaignant et la Commission ont indiqu\u00e9 que le syst\u00e8me en place, qui pr\u00eatait \u00e0 des abus de la part des contrema\u00eetres et des superviseurs, [TRADUCTION] lassait trop de latitude . Toutefois, cela soul\u00e8ve une autre question, sur laquelle Mme Knorr ne s'est pas pench\u00e9e dans le cadre de son \u00e9tude et qui r\u00e9duit la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente instruction. Si le syst\u00e8me d'attribution des t\u00e2ches \u00e9tait juste, il ne peut \u00eatre \u00e0 l'origine de la discrimination dont M. Hill dit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime, et la question qu'il faut se poser est la suivante : M. Ryan a-t-il abus\u00e9 de son autorit\u00e9? Il existait beaucoup d'hostilit\u00e9 entre les deux hommes, mais la preuve d\u00e9montre \u00e0 mon avis que M. Ryan prenait au s\u00e9rieux ses responsabilit\u00e9s de gestion. Il n'existe pas de preuves convaincantes qu'il ait abus\u00e9 de sa position.\n[103] M. Hill a fait appel de la d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son grief \u00e0 la section locale de l'AIMTA, qui a soumis la question \u00e0 l'arbitrage obligatoire. Vincent Ready a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 comme arbitre et l'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu le 15 septembre 1994. M. Ready \u00e9tait pri\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer si les recommandations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le rapport Ferguson-Rogers avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u009cuvre de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e. Le plaignant et la Commission semblent avoir insinu\u00e9 que le syndicat ne s'est pas vraiment empress\u00e9 de donner suite au grief de M. Hill. Il y a peut-\u00eatre du vrai dans cette all\u00e9gation; toutefois, on pourrait facilement interpr\u00e9ter cette situation comme une indication qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas tout \u00e0 fait convaincue du bien-fond\u00e9 du grief.\n[104] Le 19 octobre 1994, M. Ready a rendu sa d\u00e9cision, dans laquelle il passait en revue le rapport Ferguson-Rogers et concluait ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJ'ai soigneusement examin\u00e9 la preuve et les observations des parties. Je suis persuad\u00e9 que les recommandations [formul\u00e9es dans le rapport Ferguson-Rogers] constituent une r\u00e9ponse appropri\u00e9e aux plaintes de M. Hill. Le syndicat n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de mettre le doigt sur des faits et gestes ou des omissions de la compagnie qui confirmeraient l'all\u00e9gation voulant que celle-ci n'ait pas vraiment mis en \u009cuvre les recommandations. Au contraire, je trouve que les deux parties ont appliqu\u00e9 les recommandations dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela \u00e9tait faisable et possible.\n[105] M. Ready a fait sien le rapport de Mme Knorr sur l'attribution des t\u00e2ches et la formation, puis a abord\u00e9 la question du harc\u00e8lement. Bien qu'il n'ait pas reconnu qu'on ait fait la preuve qu'il y avait eu harc\u00e8lement, il a affirm\u00e9 que M. Hill ou tout autre employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait libre de soulever le probl\u00e8me \u00e0 l'avenir. M. Ready a ordonn\u00e9 que sa d\u00e9cision, les conclusions et recommandations du rapport Ferguson-Rogers et la politique de la compagnie sur le harc\u00e8lement soient affich\u00e9es \u00e0 l'atelier moteur.\n[106] M\u00eame si le rapport Ferguson-Rogers est plut\u00f4t vague, j'estime qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 une tentative r\u00e9elle pour examiner les questions soulev\u00e9es par M. Hill. Si la r\u00e9ponse de la compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 vague, c'est jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point \u00e0 cause du ton h\u00e9sitant du rapport, qui au mieux \u00e9tait provisoire. Le rapport ne contenait pas de recommandations pr\u00e9cises qui auraient pu justifier la plainte de discrimination de M. Hill et semblait surtout viser \u00e0 calmer le plaignant. En fait, le rapport indiquait qu'il n'y avait pas de preuve de discrimination explicite et soulignait simplement l'insensibilit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s de l'atelier moteur.\nii) Le deuxi\u00e8me grief [107] Le 29 juillet 1994, M. Hill a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son deuxi\u00e8me grief, qui portait sur le rejet de sa candidature pour le poste de planificateur III (maintenance des a\u00e9ronefs). Dans ce grief, il demandait \u00e0 rencontrer le jury de s\u00e9lection. Ce grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9, mais M. Clement et M. Hunter ont \u00e9ventuellement rencontr\u00e9 M. Hill. Apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 avec eux de l'entrevue et du processus de s\u00e9lection dans son ensemble, M. Hill a retir\u00e9 son grief.\niii) Le troisi\u00e8me grief [108] M. Hill a \u00e9galement soumis un troisi\u00e8me grief en vertu de l'article 39 de la convention collective, all\u00e9guant avoir personnellement \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement. Ce grief d\u00e9coulait de la situation qui avait atteint son paroxysme le 18 octobre 1994. Dave Park et Ted Pierre, qui repr\u00e9sentaient respectivement le syndicat et la direction, ont tenu des enqu\u00eates distinctes \u00e0 la fin de janvier 1995. Leurs conclusions ont fait l'objet de recommandations conjointes. Bien qu'ils aient exprim\u00e9 de la sympathie \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Hill et critiqu\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont la r\u00e9union avait \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9r\u00e9e, MM. Park et Pierre ont rejet\u00e9 l'all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement.\n[109] Le 10 mars 1995, la compagnie a convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9union, dite pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re, les personnes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eal\u00e9es aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 18 octobre afin de discuter du rapport de MM. Park et Pierre. Y ont assist\u00e9 MM. Hill, Shelford, Strohmaier, Jureidin, Ryan, Lawrence, Abbing, Cavasin, Park et Pierre. M. Hill a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait libre de revenir \u00e0 l'atelier moteur. M. Ryan avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9 \u00e0 une usine \u00e0 Tilbury, o\u00f9 se trouvait d\u00e9sormais la ligne des Dash-80. M. Hill a inform\u00e9 les participants qu'il ne reviendrait pas au travail tant que les litiges qui l'opposaient \u00e0 la compagnie n'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solus. Il a dit que la situation des minorit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'atelier moteur continuait de le pr\u00e9occuper et qu'il s'inscrivait en faux contre le rapport Knorr, tout en \u00e9mettant des doutes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des programmes offerts aux minorit\u00e9s.\n[110] M. Hill a re\u00e7u par la suite deux lettres de Canadien l'informant que la compagnie mettrait fin \u00e0 son emploi si elle ne recevait pas de ses nouvelles. D'apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, M. Beaudin, de la Human Rights Coalition de la C.-B., a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ces lettres le 17 mai 1996; il aurait alors inform\u00e9 la compagnie que M. Hill ne voulait pas retourner au travail tant que la question ne serait pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. Canadien a \u00e9ventuellement mis fin \u00e0 l'emploi de M. Hill en lui faisant parvenir une lettre recommand\u00e9e en date du 9 octobre 1996. Dans cette lettre, l'intim\u00e9e affirmait qu'elle avait ferm\u00e9 le dossier et r\u00e9clamait le remboursement d'une somme d'environ 4 000 $ vers\u00e9e au titre de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et des avantages sociaux. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas accus\u00e9 r\u00e9ception de la lettre de M. Beaudin.\nIII. ANALYSE A. Preuve prima facie [111] La pr\u00e9sente instance ne soul\u00e8ve pas de questions de droit complexes. \u00c0 la fin de l'audience, j'ai n\u00e9anmoins abord\u00e9 la question \u00e0 savoir s'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant et la Commission avaient \u00e9tabli l'existence d'une preuve prima facie. Cet aspect exige quelques explications.\n[112] Selon la jurisprudence pertinente, le fardeau de la preuve incombe d'abord \u00e0 la partie plaignante, qui doit \u00e9tablir l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, on dit habituellement que la partie intim\u00e9e doit fournir une explication. On a traditionnellement invoqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui de cette th\u00e8se l'affaire O'Malley c. Simpson Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, dans laquelle il s'agissait de d\u00e9terminer si l'on \u00e9tait en pr\u00e9sence d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Certains pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents plus r\u00e9cents indiquent qu'il appartient ensuite \u00e0 la partie plaignante de prouver que l'explication fournie par la partie intim\u00e9e pour justifier le comportement discriminatoire n'est qu'un pr\u00e9texte.\n[113] Divers probl\u00e8mes se posent ici. La jurisprudence ne semble pas avoir tenu compte des origines du crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie, sur lequel on se fonde pour d\u00e9terminer si la preuve est suffisante par elle-m\u00eame. La question qu'il faut se poser est donc la suivante : la partie intim\u00e9e doit-elle pr\u00e9senter une preuve? Cette question se pose plus naturellement apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve de la partie plaignante et de la Commission plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 la fin des d\u00e9bats. Si la partie plaignante et la Commission n'ont pas \u00e9tabli l'existence d'une preuve prima facie \u00e0 ce stade-l\u00e0 des proc\u00e9dures, la partie intim\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e0 expliquer sa conduite et a droit \u00e0 un non-lieu. Se pose \u00e9galement la question connexe \u00e0 savoir si la partie intim\u00e9e doit d\u00e9cider s'il est opportun de pr\u00e9senter une preuve avant de demander un non-lieu.\n[114] La difficult\u00e9 se pose lorsqu'on a recours au crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie \u00e0 la fin de l'instruction d'une plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Cela peut sembler possible dans une affaire (p. ex., O'Malley) o\u00f9 la partie intim\u00e9e n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve. Toutefois, il semble qu'on en soit alors \u00e0 un stade plut\u00f4t avanc\u00e9 du processus si l'application du crit\u00e8re vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la preuve est suffisante par elle-m\u00eame. Cela devient \u00e9vident si la partie intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il est superflu de lui demander d'en produire une si elle l'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait.\n[115] On trouve une analyse de la notion de preuve prima facie dans l'ouvrage The Law of Evidence in Canada. Les auteurs commencent par pr\u00e9ciser que cette notion est notoirement vague et peut signifier un certain nombre de choses. Ils \u00e9tablissent \u00e9galement une distinction entre le fardeau de pr\u00e9sentation et le fardeau ultime , c'est-\u00e0-dire entre soulever une question de droit et prouver un fait. Toute la notion de fardeau est quelque peu trompeuse ici; cependant, je dois dire que l'analyse pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ne fait que compliquer les choses.\n[116] Ils ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans les observations incidentes formul\u00e9es dans O'Malley qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le plaignant et la Commission \u00e9tablissent l'existence d'une preuve prima facie au vrai sens du terme. Ce principe est conforme \u00e0 la pratique que suivent les cours, qui demandent simplement si une affaire donn\u00e9e doit \u00eatre soumise au jury et recevoir leur attention. Le passage original suivant pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 au paragraphe 28 - tr\u00e8s conditionnel - de l'arr\u00eat O'Malley (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9) fait clairement ressortir cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment :\nLa preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9. (les italiques sont ajout\u00e9s)\nSelon mon interpr\u00e9tation de cet extrait, le Tribunal n'a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 ce moment-ci s'il ajoute foi aux all\u00e9gations. La d\u00e9cision \u00e0 savoir si l'existence d'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e implique simplement, du moins selon l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, de d\u00e9terminer si les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de la preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis.\n[117] Compte tenu de cette interpr\u00e9tation, on pourrait penser que le Tribunal peut encore parfaitement rejeter la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la partie plaignante et classer l'affaire. Je dis cela parce que le crit\u00e8re ordinaire de la preuve prima facie n'exige pas d'appr\u00e9cier la preuve, du moins dans le cours normal de l'instruction. Si le Tribunal passe simplement \u00e0 l'examen de la preuve de la partie intim\u00e9e, une des \u00e9tapes normales du processus habituel d'appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve est annul\u00e9e et la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission et la partie plaignante n'est pas sujette \u00e0 une analyse selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. C'est un r\u00e9sultat de la d\u00e9cision d'appliquer le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie \u00e0 la fin de l'audience plut\u00f4t qu'apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve par la partie plaignante et la Commission.\n[118] Il semble y avoir deux possibilit\u00e9s. La premi\u00e8re est qu'il en r\u00e9sulte simplement un transfert de la partie plaignante \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e du fardeau de prouver les all\u00e9gations selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Comme l'a affirm\u00e9 sans ambage le juge McIntyre au par. 28 de l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, la commission d'enqu\u00eate a commis une erreur en attribuant \u00e0 la Commission le fardeau de la preuve. . L'autre possibilit\u00e9 est qu'il y ait d\u00e9placement du fardeau; cela signifierait que le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l'instruction d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission est un crit\u00e8re de fond et exige que la partie plaignante prouve ses all\u00e9gations selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Je ne suis pas certain que la question ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e, m\u00eame si la notion de d\u00e9placement du fardeau de la preuve ait \u00e9t\u00e9 un sujet d'inqui\u00e9tude au sein des cours du fait qu'elle embrouille la question \u00e0 savoir o\u00f9 r\u00e9side le fardeau ultime, qui incombe normalement \u00e0 la partie qui engage l'action.\n[119] Je suis conscient du fait que la cour, dans Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3, d\u00e9clare que le fardeau se d\u00e9place mais elle ne traite pas directement de la question. Je suis enclin \u00e0 croire que, selon l'arr\u00eat O'Malley \u00e0 tout le moins, le fardeau de la preuve dans la plupart des cas de discrimination incombe \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e. S'il en est ainsi, c'est parce que c'est l'employeur qui est le mieux plac\u00e9 pour prouver l'existence d'une contrainte excessive. J'h\u00e9site n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 admettre que la Cour supr\u00eame avait l'intention de modifier le fardeau de la preuve dans un cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal n'est pas saisi de ce genre de question. Cela m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 l'affaire qui nous occupe, dans laquelle le litige entre les parties \u00e9tait remarquablement simple.\n[120] Le plaignant et la Commission ont pr\u00e9tendu qu'il y avait eu discrimination et harc\u00e8lement. L'intim\u00e9e s'est inscrite en faux contre cette pr\u00e9tention. Si le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 dans des cas o\u00f9 la partie plaignante n'a pas obtenu le poste convoit\u00e9, c'est parce que l'employeur \u00e9tait responsable de superviser le concours et \u00e9tait partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e au processus d\u00e9cisionnel. Cela n'est pas une consid\u00e9ration importante dans le cas qui nous occupe, o\u00f9 il s'agit pour moi, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant et la Commission ont \u00e9tabli le caract\u00e8re cr\u00e9dible de leurs pr\u00e9tentions. Pour ce faire, je dois appr\u00e9cier la preuve.\n[121] Il s'agit en fin de compte de d\u00e9terminer si le fardeau de la preuve devrait incomber au plaignant ou \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, et si le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 dans une affaire o\u00f9 il ne semble pas y avoir de raison de le faire. En derni\u00e8re analyse, je ne crois pas qu'il soit possible de d\u00e9roger aux r\u00e8gles de preuve habituelles, en l'absence de directives plus claires des cours. L'arr\u00eat O'Malley \u00e9taie dans une certaine mesure cette prise de position. Au paragraphe 28, le juge McIntyre d\u00e9clare :\nPar cons\u00e9quent, je suis d'accord avec la commission d'enqu\u00eate pour dire que chaque cas se ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 une question de preuve et donc que, dans ces affaires comme dans toute autre instance civile, il doit y avoir reconnaissance et attribution claires et nettes du fardeau de la preuve. \u00c0 quoi doit-il incomber? Suivant la r\u00e8gle bien d\u00e9finie en mati\u00e8re civile, ce fardeau incombe au demandeur. Celui qui r\u00e9clame l'ex\u00e9cution d'une obligation doit la prouver.\nJe ne puis dire si la r\u00e8gle habituelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e initialement pour d\u00e9courager les litiges. Cependant, ce n'est pas notre r\u00f4le ici de traiter des justifications; au surplus, la r\u00e8gle fondamentale est trop enracin\u00e9e dans notre syst\u00e8me juridique pour qu'on puisse l'\u00e9carter facilement.\n[122] Je suis conscient du fait que cela semble cr\u00e9er diff\u00e9rents fardeaux dans diff\u00e9rents cas. Dans le cas d'une all\u00e9gation de discrimination simple et d'un rejet simple, le fardeau de la preuve continue d'incomber \u00e0 la partie plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission. Si, en revanche, l'employeur invoque la contrainte excessive, le fardeau semble appartenir \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e. \u00c0 mon avis, je n'ai d'autre choix, cependant, que de m'en tenir \u00e0 l'affaire dont je suis saisi. En l'esp\u00e8ce, il ne s'agit pas de d\u00e9terminer si l'existence d'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie et si, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, une r\u00e9plique s'impose. Il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant et la Commission ont prouv\u00e9 leurs all\u00e9gations. S'il y a vraiment d\u00e9placement du fardeau de la preuve dans le cas d'une instruction relative aux droits de la personne, on semble ici \u00eatre en pr\u00e9sence d'une affaire o\u00f9 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la partie intim\u00e9e a rapport au premier fardeau plut\u00f4t qu'au second.\n[123] Je crois que ma premi\u00e8re obligation est de pr\u00e9ciser la m\u00e9thode que j'ai suivie pour \u00e9valuer la preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. \u00c0 mon avis, la question fondamentale que pose la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant et la Commission ont \u00e9tabli, au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve, s'il y a eu discrimination ou harc\u00e8lement. D'apr\u00e8s ce que je comprends, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e visait \u00e0 nier une telle conclusion et non \u00e0 prouver un ensemble distinct d'affirmations. La seule question en ce qui touche l'intim\u00e9e consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve suffisante pour compenser toute pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de preuve du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la partie adverse. La plupart des questions \u00e0 examiner en l'esp\u00e8ce ont trait \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins ordinaires.\n[124] Dans les circonstances, je ne vois pas \u00e0 quoi il servirait de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant et la Commission ont \u00e9tabli l'existence d'une preuve prima facie. Il n'est tout simplement pas n\u00e9cessaire de se livrer \u00e0 un tel examen : les litiges entre les parties r\u00e9sident dans le fond de la plainte et la question liminaire ne se pose simplement pas. Cela n'emp\u00eache pas pour autant l'intim\u00e9e de pr\u00e9tendre, du moins pour la forme, que le plaignant et la Commission n'ont pas \u00e9tabli l'existence d'une preuve prima facie. Par ailleurs, cela n'ajoute ni n'enl\u00e8ve rien \u00e0 la t\u00e2che qui m'incombe, soit d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant et la Commission ont prouv\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu'il y a eu discrimination ou harc\u00e8lement.\nB. Discrimination [125] Je suis saisi de deux plaintes. Dans la premi\u00e8re, le plaignant all\u00e8gue l'existence d'une tendance \u00e0 la discrimination contre M. Hill. On peut voir cette tendance dans l'attribution des t\u00e2ches sur la ligne des Dash-80, dans la r\u00e9partition des t\u00e2ches temporaires, dans la d\u00e9cision d'attribuer le poste de planificateur III \u00e0 quelqu'un d'autre et dans la fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de traiter les minorit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'atelier.\ni) La preuve g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [126] Il y avait une all\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de discrimination. Me Ash a pr\u00e9tendu que les meilleures affectations \u00e9taient attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me , c'est-\u00e0-dire aux employ\u00e9s qu'on pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 des promotions. Les m\u00e9caniciens qui faisaient partie d'une minorit\u00e9 visible \u00e9taient exclus de ce processus, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment en raison de leur race. Le plaignant et la Commission ont fait appel aux t\u00e9moignages d'autres t\u00e9moins, qui ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve circonstancielle de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement dans le milieu de travail. Les avocats ont qualifi\u00e9 ces t\u00e9moignages de preuve de faits similaires . Par exemple, Carl Hibbert a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination lorsqu'il avait postul\u00e9 des postes de rang plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[127] \u00c0 mon avis, le terme preuve de faits similaires ne convient pas tout \u00e0 fait en l'esp\u00e8ce; en effet, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que les exp\u00e9riences v\u00e9cues par M. Hill ressemblaient vraiment \u00e0 celles d'autres employ\u00e9s. Il n'existe pas, par exemple, de preuves indiquant que M. Ryan faisait montre de la m\u00eame hostilit\u00e9 envers d'autres m\u00e9caniciens. Les installations de motopropulsion \u00e9taient un vaste lieu de travail, et il est dangereux de g\u00e9n\u00e9raliser de cette fa\u00e7on, du moins en l'esp\u00e8ce. La ligne des 737 \u00e9tait un milieu tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de celui de la ligne des Dash-80 ou des secteurs \u00e0 forte concentration de membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles.\n[128] N\u00e9anmoins, selon la jurisprudence, la preuve circonstancielle peut aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu discrimination. Cette situation d\u00e9coule du fait qu'il est souvent difficile de pr\u00e9senter des preuves directes de discrimination. Dans Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Chopra, [1998] C.F. no 432, par exemple, le juge Richard a soutenu qu'on pouvait s'appuyer sur la preuve statistique concernant la r\u00e9partition des membres des minorit\u00e9s au sein du lieu de travail pour conclure que la partie plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de discrimination (1). Bien que certains t\u00e9moignages aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition des membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles chez Canadien, Mme Knorr a indiqu\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9position qu'il n'existait pas de donn\u00e9es fiables du fait que le syndicat d\u00e9courageait les employ\u00e9s de remplir les formulaires pertinents.\n[129] La d\u00e9cision Chopra est n\u00e9anmoins utile pour \u00e9tablir l'importance de la preuve contextuelle. Au paragraphe 22, le juge Richard soutient que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique peuvent \u00eatre admis comme preuve circonstancielle de discrimination. Cela va bien au-del\u00e0 de l'admissibilit\u00e9 de preuves statistiques et comprend le t\u00e9moignage personnel d'autres employ\u00e9s qui peuvent avoir souffert de la m\u00eame tendance \u00e0 la discrimination. Il s'ensuit que la preuve g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de discrimination au sein du milieu de travail peut \u00eatre utile pour d\u00e9terminer s'il existe une preuve dans un cas particulier.\n[130] Le probl\u00e8me est que la majeure partie de cette preuve, en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tait vague et fond\u00e9e sur des impressions. Il s'agissait surtout d'opinions personnelles. De plus, elle \u00e9tait s\u00e9lective, comme l'a clairement indiqu\u00e9 la preuve concernant la formation qui \u00e9tait donn\u00e9e aux m\u00e9caniciens de Canadien. La formation en question semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e avant 1992, soit il y a plus de dix ans, et les t\u00e9moignages \u00e9taient vagues. Bien qu'il puisse y avoir eu favoritisme dans le choix des employ\u00e9s qui recevaient cette formation, il est tr\u00e8s difficile de d\u00e9terminer aussi longtemps apr\u00e8s le fait si les all\u00e9gations \u00e9taient un tant soit peu fond\u00e9es. Je peux comprendre les soup\u00e7ons du plaignant et de la Commission, mais le doute n'est pas une preuve.\n[131] Le plaignant et la Commission peuvent naturellement estimer que Canadien a profit\u00e9 du fait qu'elle n'a pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le nombre de membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles au sein de son effectif. Je suis n\u00e9anmoins dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 admettre la preuve fond\u00e9e sur des impressions que la repr\u00e9sentation des minorit\u00e9s visibles aux \u00e9chelons sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e9tait nettement faible vers la fin des ann\u00e9es 80 et le d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90. Toutefois, je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 partir de cela que M. Hill a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de discrimination dans ses propres tentatives pour obtenir de l'avancement. Si je dis cela, c'est parce que l'ensemble de la preuve d\u00e9montre que les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles M. Hill a fait face \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 ses propres faits et gestes.\n[132] La Commission a aussi cit\u00e9 Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. 5029 (T.C.D.P.) et Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. 12 (C.A.F.) comme sources \u00e0 l'appui du principe qu'il est suffisant que la question raciale ait \u00e9t\u00e9 un des facteurs ayant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la situation d\u00e9plor\u00e9e par M. Hill. J'admets ce principe qui, toutefois, n'est pas utile en l'esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 mon avis, le conflit de personnalit\u00e9 qui s'est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 entre M. Hill et M. Ryan n'\u00e9tait pas attribuable \u00e0 la race du plaignant, quelles que soient les opinions racistes que M. Ryan pouvait avoir. Il \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t le r\u00e9sultat de l'attitude de M. Hill \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son travail, de son ressentiment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'autorit\u00e9 et de sa tendance \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer les autres pour ses probl\u00e8mes.\n[133] Dans les circonstances, je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 assimiler les exp\u00e9riences d'autres m\u00e9caniciens \u00e0 celles de M. Hill. Comme le Tribunal l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Swan c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes) (1994) 25 C.H.R.R. 312 (par. 30), il doit y avoir un lien entre la preuve contextuelle et la question dont il est saisi. Je me retrouve \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans la situation o\u00f9 \u00e9tait le Tribunal dans cette instance-l\u00e0, o\u00f9 on a soutenu que les t\u00e9moignages concernant les all\u00e9gations d'autres personnes n'ajoutent pas \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant. En outre, il faut \u00e9galement faire preuve de circonspection lorsqu'on s'appuie sur une preuve circonstancielle, particuli\u00e8rement dans les cas o\u00f9 d'autres facteurs peuvent expliquer ce qui s'est produit.\n[134] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la r\u00e8gle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l'affaire Hodge (affaire criminelle) semble pertinente. En vertu de cette r\u00e8gle, un individu ne peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 sur la foi d'une preuve circonstancielle, \u00e0 moins que cette preuve soit en contradiction avec toute autre explication rationnelle . Le plaignant et la Commission ont produit un extrait de la page 141 de l'ouvrage Proving Discrimination in Canada, dont l'auteur s'inscrit en faux contre une d\u00e9cision ontarienne et pr\u00e9tend que la r\u00e8gle n'est pas pertinente dans une affaire o\u00f9 la norme civile de preuve s'applique (2). Toutefois, j'oserais pr\u00e9tendre que l'origine du crit\u00e8re est li\u00e9e davantage \u00e0 la fragilit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente de la preuve circonstancielle qu'au fardeau de la preuve.\n[135] \u00c0 mon avis, il est suffisant en l'esp\u00e8ce de dire qu'un tribunal devrait h\u00e9siter \u00e0 se prononcer contre l'intim\u00e9e sur la foi d'une preuve circonstancielle, alors qu'il existe une autre explication possible et raisonnable \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie voulant que le plaignant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de discrimination ou de harc\u00e8lement. L'effet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pr\u00e9judiciable d'une preuve de faits similaires est bien reconnu : bien que les r\u00e8gles de preuve aient \u00e9t\u00e9 assouplies dans le contexte des droits de la personne, la jurisprudence soutient qu'une telle preuve est admissible uniquement lorsque la valeur probante exc\u00e8de le pr\u00e9judice qu'elle est susceptible de causer. Voir Mehta c. MacKay (1990), 15 C.H.R.R. 232 (Division d'appel de la N.-\u00c9.) et Hewstan c. Auchinlek (1997), 29 C.H.R.R. 309 (T.C.D.P.), p. 313.\n[136] Une autre question se pose dans le contexte de la preuve g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de discrimination. Les avocats ont soutenu que les questions syst\u00e9miques entourant le milieu de travail ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es \u00e0 l'attention de la compagnie lorsque M. Hill a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son premier grief, cr\u00e9ant ainsi une obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de corriger la situation. Bien qu'il y ait eu un certain nombre d'enqu\u00eates, le plaignant et la Commission ont pr\u00e9tendu que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas accord\u00e9 \u00e0 cette question l'importance qu'elle m\u00e9ritait et n'y a pas donn\u00e9 suite de fa\u00e7on diligente. Pour reprendre la formule employ\u00e9e par Me Fakirani, on [TRADUCTION] laissait constamment passer l'occasion .\n[137] Je conviens que la question de la discrimination et celle du harc\u00e8lement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es \u00e0 l'attention de l'employeur et qu'il en a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 une obligation de faire enqu\u00eate et de rem\u00e9dier aux probl\u00e8mes qui existaient dans le milieu de travail. Cependant, je ne suis pas d'accord pour dire que l'employeur a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir de diligence raisonnable. J'admets que les tentatives de la compagnie pour r\u00e9gler ces questions n'ont peut-\u00eatre pas re\u00e7u autant d'attention que d'autres probl\u00e8mes. Des efforts r\u00e9els et importants ont toutefois \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s. J'accepte les conclusions du rapport Ferguson-Rogers, la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre Ready et le bref rapport de Mme Knorr sur les t\u00e2ches temporaires. En outre, je crois que le plaignant et la Commission n'ont pas tenu compte des tentatives sinc\u00e8res de la direction pour composer avec M. Hill apr\u00e8s l'incident du 18 octobre 1994.\n[138] J'ajouterais que l'employeur a l'obligation d'assurer un milieu de travail exempt de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement et que ce devoir de diligence raisonnable s'\u00e9tendait aux vastes probl\u00e8mes que comportait le milieu de travail. Cependant, les seules plaintes dont je suis saisi sont les plaintes personnelles de M. Hill, qui ont pris initialement la forme de griefs. Le r\u00e9sultat de ces griefs a \u00e9t\u00e9 loin d'\u00eatre parfait; toutefois, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus que suffisant \u00e0 mon avis pour satisfaire au devoir de diligence raisonnable de l'employeur. Je ne crois pas qu'il y ait des raisons de soulever le principe de la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait d'autrui, qui n'est pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nii) L'emploi du terme Nig Nog [139] Il est \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que M. Ryan a qualifi\u00e9 M. Hill de Nig Nog . Le Oxford English Dictionary et le Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang donnent pour ce terme deux acceptions, qui confirment les positions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les parties. Selon M. Ryan, ce terme est utilis\u00e9 dans le Lancashire et signifie sot . Il semble que c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0, \u00e0 l'origine, le sens du terme qui est peut-\u00eatre apparent\u00e9 au mot noggin (ciboulot). La connotation raciste semble r\u00e9sulter d'une d\u00e9formation du sens initial du terme, qui d\u00e9signe les nouveaux arrivants ou les immigrants qui ne sont pas de race blanche; il ne fait aucun doute que l'effet cr\u00e9\u00e9 par ce terme tient en partie \u00e0 sa ressemblance avec le terme anglais nigger . Si M. Ryan tentait de trouver une fa\u00e7on subtile de provoquer M. Hill, il a certainement r\u00e9ussi.\n[140] J'accepte l'affirmation de M. Hill voulant qu'il se soit offusqu\u00e9 de l'emploi de ce terme par M. Ryan. Toutefois, il n'existe pas vraiment de preuve, hormis le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant, que M. Ryan a utilis\u00e9 ce mot apr\u00e8s que M. Hill eut trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 redire sur son emploi. Je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter la parole de M. Ryan qu'il a cess\u00e9 d'utiliser ce terme. Bien qu'on puisse avoir de s\u00e9rieux doutes, il serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 mon avis de conclure, au regard de la preuve, que M. Ryan a employ\u00e9 le terme comme \u00e9pith\u00e8te raciste. Tout compte fait, M. Ryan \u00e9tait un homme prudent dans ses rapports avec ses sup\u00e9rieurs et les m\u00e9caniciens de son \u00e9quipe. Il n'\u00e9tait pas dans ses habitudes d'utiliser des termes ayant une connotation nettement raciste lorsqu'il s'adressait \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s.\niii) Les t\u00e2ches temporaires [141] Voyons maintenant ce qui en est de l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Hill faisait l'objet d'une discrimination dans l'attribution des t\u00e2ches temporaires. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je me sens oblig\u00e9 de dire que ce n'est pas mon r\u00f4le que de d\u00e9cider comment doit \u00eatre g\u00e9r\u00e9 un lieu de travail. C'est la pr\u00e9rogative de la direction. Il ne fait aucun doute que l'attribution des t\u00e2ches dans les ateliers d'usinage \u00e9tait laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion de chaque contrema\u00eetre et n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur un syst\u00e8me tr\u00e8s structur\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que c'\u00e9tait un aspect in\u00e9vitable des n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s du service dans les ateliers. De toute \u00e9vidence, les superviseurs \u00e9taient appel\u00e9s dans maintes situations \u00e0 user de leur jugement dans l'\u00e9tablissement des priorit\u00e9s et l'attribution des t\u00e2ches.\n[142] Le plaignant et la Commission se sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e par M. Ryan pour affecter les m\u00e9caniciens au secteur H. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Ryan a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait souvent appel\u00e9 \u00e0 envoyer des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'atelier d'usinage des pales. Il s'agit l\u00e0 \u00e0 mon avis d'une tentative pour s'absoudre de toute responsabilit\u00e9, car il ne fait aucun doute qu'il avait un gros mot \u00e0 dire dans ces d\u00e9cisions. Lorsqu'il lui fallait exercer son jugement, il d\u00e9p\u00eachait les m\u00e9caniciens qui travaillaient \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches peu urgentes. Il est \u00e9vident, par ailleurs, qu'il n'avait pas une haute opinion des comp\u00e9tences de M. Hill en tant que m\u00e9canicien et qu'il estimait que ce dernier n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure d'accomplir les t\u00e2ches importantes.\n[143] La Commission et le plaignant ont pr\u00e9tendu qu'on aurait d\u00fb tenir un registre des t\u00e2ches temporaires. Dans leur plaidoyer \u00e9crit, ils ont formul\u00e9 la remarque suivante :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa Commission et le plaignant soutiennent que le syst\u00e8me ne peut \u00eatre g\u00e9r\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate en l'absence de politiques et de proc\u00e9dures \u00e9crites d\u00e9crivant le fonctionnement du syst\u00e8me, et sans des dossiers permettant de tenir \u00e0 jour les renseignements au sujet du syst\u00e8me. Un syst\u00e8me non document\u00e9 n'est gu\u00e8re de nature \u00e0 rassurer les employ\u00e9s, qui n'ont d'autre choix que de s'en remettre au bon vouloir et \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire de leurs superviseurs. Ce genre de syst\u00e8me est arbitraire et rend le suivi difficile. La Commission et le plaignant estiment qu'un tel syst\u00e8me entrave s\u00e9rieusement tout effort visant \u00e0 assurer une attribution de fa\u00e7on juste et \u00e9quitable des t\u00e2ches.\nJ'admets qu'on aurait d\u00fb tenir un registre des t\u00e2ches temporaires, du moins dans un cas comme celui-ci o\u00f9 l'attribution du travail \u00e9tait un sujet de controverse.\n[144] Cependant, je rejette la th\u00e8se selon laquelle tous les m\u00e9caniciens auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre trait\u00e9s sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 du point de vue de l'affectation des t\u00e2ches les moins int\u00e9ressantes. Cela aurait min\u00e9 le r\u00f4le des contrema\u00eetres et des superviseurs, qui avaient le droit, voire le devoir, de g\u00e9rer l'atelier au meilleur de leur jugement. Un contrema\u00eetre a le droit de confier \u00e0 ses meilleurs m\u00e9caniciens les t\u00e2ches les plus importantes ou les plus difficiles et d'affecter les m\u00e9caniciens moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s et comp\u00e9tents \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches comme l'\u00e9quilibrage, l'inspection et le r\u00e9usinage des pales. Il y va de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du transport a\u00e9rien. L'employeur a le droit de s'en remettre \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation subjective d'un contrema\u00eetre pour d\u00e9terminer la meilleure fa\u00e7on d'attribuer les t\u00e2ches aux m\u00e9caniciens. Il n'appartient pas au Tribunal de pr\u00e9ciser ce genre de d\u00e9tails; il n'a pas les connaissances n\u00e9cessaires pour ce faire.\n[145] Cela ne signifie pas que l'employeur peut exercer une discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des m\u00e9caniciens moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s, qui ont le droit de jouir des possibilit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour progresser dans leur carri\u00e8re. Il faut atteindre un \u00e9quilibre entre les divers int\u00e9r\u00eats. On doit se demander s'il existe des preuves concr\u00e8tes qu'un contrema\u00eetre a profit\u00e9 de la situation pour favoriser certains m\u00e9caniciens et en punir d'autres. L'existence d'un registre peut aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer cela mais n'est pas d\u00e9terminante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. On n'a pas vraiment contest\u00e9 le nombre de fois que M. Hill a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au secteur H; comme sa situation \u00e9tait unique, je ne vois pas comment un registre pourrait faire une diff\u00e9rence dans mon \u00e9valuation des faits.\n[146] Les choses \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8res de la vie quotidienne prennent un sens ou un autre, selon le c\u00f4t\u00e9 o\u00f9 l'on est. Un grand nombre d'activit\u00e9s courantes de la vie quotidienne rev\u00eatent un aspect sinistre, si l'on a tendance \u00e0 les voir sous cet angle. Ainsi, M. Hill a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'on lui confiait toujours les [TRADUCTION] sales besognes, celles qui exigeaient l'emploi de lubrifiants et d'autres produits dangereux pour la sant\u00e9. En revanche, M. Radominski a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que M. Hill n'aimait pas se salir les mains. Aussi utilisait-il les lubrifiants avec tellement de parcimonie qu'il \u00e9tait presque impossible de s\u00e9parer certaines pi\u00e8ces qu'il avait assembl\u00e9es. Cette situation posait probl\u00e8me lorsqu'il fallait refaire le travail. La question qui se pose est la suivante : la pr\u00e9tention de M. Hill \u00e9tait-elle le reflet d'une perception ou de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9?\n[147] Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve que M. Hill ait fait l'objet d'une discrimination du point de vue de la r\u00e9partition des t\u00e2ches temporaires. Par rapport au reste de la preuve, les t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard relevaient davantage de la sp\u00e9culation. Entraient en ligne de compte dans le processus d\u00e9cisionnel beaucoup d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments, dont certains peuvent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Hill. J'accepte, par exemple, le t\u00e9moignage d'un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins qui ont indiqu\u00e9 que M. Hill ne faisait pas preuve d'autant d'initiative que certains autres m\u00e9caniciens. Plut\u00f4t que de travailler, il attendait qu'on lui confie des t\u00e2ches. Cela le rendait plus vuln\u00e9rable, car il \u00e9tait plus \u00e0 la merci du contrema\u00eetre et risquait davantage \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des secteurs p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques.\n[148] Bien que l'un des objectifs du processus des droits de la personne soit d'\u00e9duquer les employeurs et les employ\u00e9s, notre Constitution prot\u00e8ge la libert\u00e9 de conscience et il ne m'appartient pas de r\u00e9glementer les opinions personnelles des individus. L'aveu de M. Ryan qu'il n'a pas de points de vue racistes ne me convainc pas. N\u00e9anmoins, la preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e indique qu'il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 les garder suffisamment pour lui afin de pr\u00e9server l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de ses d\u00e9cisions concernant l'affectation des t\u00e2ches. Je ne puis aller au-del\u00e0 de cela. \u00c0 mon avis, il est clair que M. Ryan \u00e9tait conscient de l'autorit\u00e9 et savait que ses sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e9taient sensibles \u00e0 la question de la discrimination.\n[149] L'intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que la m\u00e9thode d'attribution des t\u00e2ches temporaires \u00e9tait bien adapt\u00e9e aux n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s du service. M. Shelford \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il avait sinc\u00e8rement examin\u00e9 la question en demandant \u00e0 Mme Knorr de produire un rapport; il en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le syst\u00e8me d'attribution des t\u00e2ches \u00e9tait juste et \u00e9quitable. M. Strohmaier a abond\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens. Je ne puis dire que ces conclusions \u00e9taient d\u00e9raisonnables. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de faire fonctionner efficacement l'atelier moteur sans l'attribution de t\u00e2ches temporaires. Il est \u00e9vident que les r\u00e8gles habituelles d'attribution du travail devaient parfois faire place \u00e0 des m\u00e9thodes ad hoc.\nC. Le poste de planificateur III [150] Passons maintenant \u00e0 la candidature de M. Hill au poste de planificateur III. Les conditions fondamentales \u00e0 remplir pour prouver qu'un employeur a exerc\u00e9 une discrimination dans l'attribution d'un poste sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans Shakes c. Rex Park (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 (Comm. d'enq. de l'Ont.), \u00e0 la p. D\/1002 :\nDans une plainte relative \u00e0 un emploi, la Commission \u00e9tablit habituellement qu'il s'agit d'une preuve suffisante \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, en prouvant :\nque le plaignant avait les qualifications pour l'emploi en cause, que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9, et qu'une personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui n'avait pas le trait distinctif \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission des droits de la personne (race, couleur, etc.) a obtenu le poste. Si la Commission r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 prouver ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il incombe alors au mis en cause de fournir une explication\nIl ne sert \u00e0 rien de d\u00e9battre ce genre de questions en l'esp\u00e8ce. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que le plaignant avait les qualifications n\u00e9cessaires pour le poste de planificateur III. J'admets qu'il r\u00e9pondait aux crit\u00e8res d'admissibilit\u00e9; toutefois, selon les t\u00e9moignages de MM. Clement et Hunter en particulier, il s'est montr\u00e9 un candidat pi\u00e8tre et inexp\u00e9riment\u00e9.\n[151] Le fait que la personne qui a obtenu le poste ne semblait pas poss\u00e9der les qualifications n\u00e9cessaires vient compliquer les choses. M. Hunter a reconnu le probl\u00e8me, mais cela ne signifie pas pour autant, compte tenu des circonstances entourant cette plainte, que M. Hill ait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination raciale. La preuve prouve qu'il en est autrement : abstraction faite du fait qu'il n'avait pas les connaissances voulues pour le poste de planificateur III, je dois dire que l'attitude de M. Hill au travail, aspect qui est ressorti lors de son entrevue, l'aurait probablement emp\u00each\u00e9 d'obtenir des postes plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s. Je suis conscient du fait qu'il voit peut-\u00eatre cela comme le prix \u00e0 payer pour contester une direction passive, mais c'est l\u00e0 une opinion partiale et je ne puis qu'affirmer que son attitude g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du travail lassait vraiment \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer.\nD. Le harc\u00e8lement [152] Il n'est point n\u00e9cessaire d'analyser en profondeur la l\u00e9gislation sur le harc\u00e8lement. L'intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Dhanjal c. Air Canada (1996) 28 C.H.R.R. 367 (TCDP), (1996), confirm\u00e9e par [1997] A.C.F. no 1599 (C.A.F.), qui indique que le harc\u00e8lement doit \u00eatre persistant et fr\u00e9quent. Le harc\u00e8lement r\u00e9side essentiellement dans la cr\u00e9ation d'un climat de travail hostile qui porte atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 personnelle du plaignant. Il empoisonne le milieu de travail, le prive de sa neutralit\u00e9 et humilie la personne harcel\u00e9e. Quiconque harc\u00e8le un plaignant manque \u00e0 son obligation de respecter la dignit\u00e9 fondamentale de la personne.\n[153] Le droit \u00e9tablit une distinction entre le fondement subjectif et le fondement objectif du harc\u00e8lement. Ainsi qu'il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au paragraphe 210 de la d\u00e9cision Dhanjal, il faut appr\u00e9hender la gravit\u00e9 d'une conduite contest\u00e9e sous l'angle de la victime . Par ailleurs, le Tribunal doit se fonder sur le point de vue d'une victime raisonnable. Au paragraphe 213, le Tribunal d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\nPlusieurs facteurs peuvent entrer en ligne de compte dans l'\u00e9valuation de la raisonnabilit\u00e9 du comportement reproch\u00e9. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, nous partageons l'avis de Me Pentney lorsqu'il affirme dans son ouvrage Tarnopolsky et Pentney, Discrimination and the Law, (Toronto, De Boo, 1985 et suppl. cumulatifs), p. 8-31 et 8-32, ceci :\nLes limites normales de l'interaction sociale dans les circonstances constituent l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment fondamental dont il faut tenir compte lorsque nous appliquons ce crit\u00e8re [ ]\nPlusieurs facteurs sont pertinents aux fins de l'\u00e9valuation des limites de l'interaction sociale raisonnable , notamment la nature de la conduite en cause, le milieu de travail, le type d'interaction personnelle entre les parties dans le pass\u00e9 et l'existence d'une objection ou d'une plainte.\nL'affaire dont je suis saisi d\u00e9borde ce cadre, car il ne fait aucun doute dans mon esprit que le plaignant a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les limites de l'interaction raisonnable. Cela semble \u00eatre l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9terminant en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[154] Il existait chez Canadien une politique sur le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail, qui \u00e9tait relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui pr\u00e9cisait que les insultes et commentaires racistes [TRADUCTION] portant atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 d'une personne ou d'un groupe seraient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme du harc\u00e8lement. Cela ne signifie pas que l'employeur devait assurer un milieu de travail parfait. Il \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable, compte tenu des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, du niveau d'\u00e9ducation et de la nature de l'effectif, que les \u00e9changes quotidiens entre employ\u00e9s comportent certains commentaires crus ou grivois. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Cavasin, bien que livr\u00e9 dans l'auguste enceinte d'un tribunal, illustre bien ce point. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas une partie de plaisir.\n[155] On a beaucoup fait \u00e9tat du fait que le poste de coordonnateur de la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement dot\u00e9 et que la compagnie n'avait pas d'agents qui s'occupaient de cette politique. Les employ\u00e9s de l'atelier moteur n'\u00e9taient pas conscients de l'existence du poste en question et j'admets que la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e comme elle aurait d\u00fb l'\u00eatre. Cela ne veut par dire pour autant, toutefois, que Canadien a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de pr\u00e9venir le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail. Il serait plus exact \u00e0 mon avis de dire que Canadien avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 toutes ses obligations, dont la plupart avaient rapport \u00e0 la survie m\u00eame de l'entreprise. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Knorr a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait jou\u00e9 le r\u00f4le de coordonnatrice de la politique et s'\u00e9tait occup\u00e9e de certaines questions \u00e0 r\u00e9gler. Bien que la compagnie ait \u00e9t\u00e9 loin d'avoir une conduite exemplaire, je suis persuad\u00e9 qu'elle a fait une tentative s\u00e9rieuse, bien que limit\u00e9e, pour lutter contre le racisme en milieu de travail, ainsi qu'en attestent les efforts qu'elle a faits en r\u00e9action aux plaintes de M. Hill. Quels que soient les probl\u00e8mes auxquels elle s'est heurt\u00e9e, la compagnie a fait \u00e0 mon sens un effort sinc\u00e8re pour examiner le bien-fond\u00e9 de ses plaintes.\n[156] Je n'ai point l'intention de tenter de d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure les graffitis dans les salles de bains \u00e9taient de nature raciste. Il est suffisant de dire que le racisme \u00e9tait l'un des th\u00e8mes illustr\u00e9s. Rien n'indique qu'il y avait ailleurs un s\u00e9rieux probl\u00e8me de graffitis; par ailleurs, certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve indiquent que la direction a pris des mesures pour enrayer le probl\u00e8me. Je ne vois pas non plus de raison d'analyser la fr\u00e9quence \u00e0 laquelle les salles de bains \u00e9taient repeintes. Il est vrai que M. Shelford n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de le faire aussi souvent qu'il l'aurait voulu en raison des restrictions budg\u00e9taires. Il reste cependant que la direction a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Shelford a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 qu'il avait abord\u00e9 celui-ci lors d'une r\u00e9union avec les employ\u00e9s et d'entretiens avec les superviseurs et les contrema\u00eetres. Les gestes pos\u00e9s par l'employeur \u00e9taient s\u00e9rieux et sinc\u00e8res.\n[157] En tout \u00e9tat de cause, la preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard porte sur des probl\u00e8mes plus syst\u00e9miques qui semblent \u00eatre davantage au c\u009cur de la plainte. Elle fournit un important contexte, qui est utile pour examiner les origines de la plainte de M. Hill; cependant, je dois dire qu'elle ne permet pas d'expliquer la s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui a finalement entra\u00een\u00e9 la cessation de son emploi. Voil\u00e0 qui nous ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 la question du lien. La preuve est accablante : M Hill a cr\u00e9\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame les probl\u00e8mes auxquels il a fait face. L'intim\u00e9e a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que le plaignant ne s'\u00e9tait pas plaint des graffitis ou des insultes racistes avant son d\u00e9part de chez Canadien et avant que la compagnie \u00e9tablisse un dossier contre lui. Je soup\u00e7onne que le recul a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans toute cette affaire, mais je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement la cible d'inconvenances racistes.\n[158] La quasi-totalit\u00e9 de la preuve de harc\u00e8lement personnel a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant. M. Hill a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Gordy White, Bill Davidson, Herb Pierce et M. Ryan utilisaient tous un langage raciste ou des \u00e9pith\u00e8tes racistes \u00e0 son endroit. Je n'admets pas que M. Ryan ait fait cela; en ce qui concerne les autres individus, \u00e0 l'exception de Herb Pierce, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9taient fragment\u00e9s et n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9s. Le seul individu qui, selon les all\u00e9gations, aurait prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des commentaires racistes m\u00e9prisants \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Hill sur la ligne des Dash-80 \u00e9tait M. Pierce. Rien n'indique qu'il existait une telle tendance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale chez les autres m\u00e9caniciens. J'ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il est clair dans mon esprit que les employ\u00e9s sont devenus beaucoup plus sensibles au probl\u00e8me au fil du temps.\n[159] Bien que je soup\u00e7onne que les minorit\u00e9s ne soient pas trait\u00e9es avec le respect et la dignit\u00e9 qu'elles m\u00e9ritent, je crois que le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La preuve d\u00e9montre que de nombreux m\u00e9caniciens n'\u00e9taient pas respectueux \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des autres employ\u00e9s. Cette remarque s'applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 M. Hill. Je suis convaincu, en outre, que le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait plus aigu si on remonte dans le temps. Il ne fait aucun doute qu'il \u00e9tait courant \u00e0 l'atelier de prof\u00e9rer des commentaires offensants. Certains de ces commentaires rev\u00eataient un caract\u00e8re sexuel; d'autres \u00e9taient de nature raciste. Maints commentaires \u00e9taient scatologiques. C'est peut-\u00eatre de la na\u00efvet\u00e9 de ma part, mais le manque g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de respect mutuel chez les m\u00e9caniciens m'\u00e9tonne. Les t\u00e9moignages d'un certain nombre de m\u00e9caniciens ont fait ressortir qu'il y avait beaucoup de harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 l'atelier. Ce genre de comportement aide beaucoup \u00e0 expliquer certaines formes d'humour plut\u00f4t offensantes qui avaient cours \u00e0 l'atelier, qui \u00e9taient manifestement humiliantes pour ceux qui en \u00e9taient la cible.\n[160] Cette situation \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point in\u00e9vitable, compte tenu des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, du niveau d'\u00e9ducation et de la nature de l'effectif. Bien qu'on ait affirm\u00e9 lors de t\u00e9moignages que les ateliers d'usinage demeuraient productifs, on ne peut gu\u00e8re douter que l'incertitude qui existait au sujet de l'avenir de la compagnie exacerbait cet aspect. Mme Knorr a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que cette situation cr\u00e9ait d'\u00e9normes pressions chez tous les employ\u00e9s. Cela n'excuse pas les comportements d\u00e9plac\u00e9s mais permet de les situer en contexte. Au paragraphe 80 de la d\u00e9cision Dhami c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'immigration) (1989), 11 C.H.R.R. 253 (TCDP), on peut lire que des facteurs comme le malaise r\u00e9sultant des pressions exerc\u00e9es au moment d'une r\u00e9organisation et d'une int\u00e9gration peuvent \u00eatre pertinents lorsqu'il s'agit d'\u00e9valuer si un plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible d'un comportement motiv\u00e9 par une attitude raciste.\n[161] Il est \u00e9vident que les m\u00e9caniciens truffaient leurs \u00e9changes de tout ce qui semblait offensant, comme le font les adolescents qui d\u00e9fient les normes habituelles de courtoisie. La preuve d\u00e9montre, par exemple, qu'un m\u00e9canicien d'origine chinoise se qualifiait lui-m\u00eame de chinetoque . C'est comme si on cherchait \u00e0 repousser le plus loin possible les limites du civisme, au profit d'une forme de sport plut\u00f4t douteuse. M. Hill a particip\u00e9, avec un certain plaisir, semble-t-il, \u00e0 ce jeu auquel on s'adonnait. Je me rends bien compte que le m\u00e9canicien qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme un fourreur de chiens sur le formulaire d'\u00e9valuation de rendement \u00e9tait sans doute l'un de ceux qui ont formul\u00e9 des commentaires racistes. Par ailleurs, il est vrai que les commentaires inscrits sur le formulaire n'ont rien de raciste. Toutefois, ces consid\u00e9rations ne semblent pas pertinentes; M. Hill ne peut se conduire de cette fa\u00e7on et esp\u00e9rer pouvoir, comme d'autres, recourir aux bons offices du Tribunal.\n[162] Franchement, le plaignant ne peut s'inscrire en faux contre un comportement dans lequel il semblait se complaire. Il faut regarder les choses en face. S'il \u00e9tait offens\u00e9 par des commentaires racistes mais se plaisait \u00e0 affubler les gens de sobriquets sexistes tels que vieille paire de t\u00e9tons et pelote d\u00e9bile , M. Hill se montrait simplement s\u00e9lectif quant \u00e0 la forme de d\u00e9nigrement. Il importe de noter qu'il y avait des femmes au sein de l'effectif. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Ghuman selon lequel M. Hill se plaisait \u00e0 employer ce genre de termes en pr\u00e9sence des individus auxquels il s'adressait. Il s'agit l\u00e0 en soi d'une forme de harc\u00e8lement qui mine la dignit\u00e9 de la personne. La situation en l'esp\u00e8ce diff\u00e8re de celle d\u00e9crite dans Swan c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) - pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e - o\u00f9 le plaignant a admis qu'il ne trouvait pas offensants certains commentaires racistes qui lui \u00e9taient adress\u00e9s sur un ton moqueur.\n[163] Dans Swan, le Tribunal a conclu que le fait que le plaignant participe lui-m\u00eame au comportement raciste ne justifie pas pour autant ce comportement. Je conviens que ce genre de comportement est inacceptable et, partant, injustifiable, quel que soit le degr\u00e9 de consentement. Il faut \u00e9tablir une distinction entre les situations o\u00f9 l'on se sent oblig\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 ce genre de comportement m\u00eame si cela est contre sa nature, et celles o\u00f9 l'on y participe volontairement. L'obligation de respecter la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 de la personne est r\u00e9ciproque; \u00e0 mon avis, il faut appliquer en quelque sorte dans le domaine des droits de la personne une doctrine exigeant une conduite irr\u00e9prochable, du moins pour ce qui est des plaintes personnelles. Une politique qui r\u00e9compenserait les plaignants qui portent atteinte aux droits fondamentaux d'autres employ\u00e9s nuirait \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation du syst\u00e8me des droits de la personne. Dans le cas des plaintes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, l'ensemble d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer est diff\u00e9rent.\n[164] L'intim\u00e9e a fait valoir qu'il existe certaines similitudes entre la pr\u00e9sente instance et l'affaire Dhanjal c. Air Canada - pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e - o\u00f9 il existait un conflit de personnalit\u00e9 entre le plaignant et son superviseur. Tout comme dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, des t\u00e9moins avaient affirm\u00e9 que le superviseur trouvait vraiment \u00e0 redire sur le travail du plaignant. Le superviseur \u00e9tait d\u00e9crit comme un gestionnaire autoritaire qui traitait avec d\u00e9sinvolture les employ\u00e9s relevant de lui. Je ne sais pas si M. Ryan correspond \u00e0 cette description; cependant, il n'y a aucun doute dans mon esprit que l'autorit\u00e9 \u00e9tait au c\u009cur du bras-de-fer entre MM. Hill et Ryan. Je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 dire qu'on n'a pas \u00e9tabli en l'esp\u00e8ce l'existence d'une preuve prima facie, comme l'a fait le Tribunal dans Dhanjal. Toutefois, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant rel\u00e8ve davantage de la sp\u00e9culation que de toute autre chose et est mince au regard des normes juridiques.\n[165] L'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement cit\u00e9 l'affaire Baptiste c. Canada (Service correctionnel), [2001] (T.C.D.P.), o\u00f9 le Tribunal s'est estim\u00e9 incapable de conclure que les pi\u00e8tres \u00e9valuations faites par la superviseure de la plaignante \u00e9taient motiv\u00e9es par des consid\u00e9rations racistes. Il existait un conflit de personnalit\u00e9 entre la plaignante et sa superviseure, qui est devenue de plus en plus frustr\u00e9e au fil du temps. Dans ce genre de situation, on en arrive \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 la perception \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un employ\u00e9 devient empreinte d'animosit\u00e9, voire d'hostilit\u00e9 pure et simple. Lorsque les choses en sont \u00e0 ce point, l'employ\u00e9 se sent victimis\u00e9 et acquiert la ferme conviction que c'est son superviseur qui est le probl\u00e8me. Dans un tel cas, il est tout \u00e0 fait naturel d'imputer \u00e0 autrui ses propres difficult\u00e9s.\n[166] Je ne mets pas en doute la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sentiments de M. Hill. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la race \u00e9tait l'un des traits d\u00e9finitoires \u00e0 l'atelier moteur, avec toutes les connotations n\u00e9gatives que cela comportait, il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant qu'il se soit rabattu l\u00e0-dessus pour expliquer ce qui s'est produit. Il n'est pas utile en l'esp\u00e8ce de se demander si une personne raisonnable qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la place de M. Hill se serait sentie harcel\u00e9e. La position dans laquelle se trouvait M. Hill \u00e9tait unique, et je suis oblig\u00e9 de dire que je ne crois pas qu'une personne ayant une attitude plus raisonnable aurait pu se retrouver dans le m\u00eame genre de situation. M. Hill a connu sa part de malchance dans sa vie et la situation au travail est peut-\u00eatre devenue le point de convergence de probl\u00e8mes plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Il n'y a rien que je puisse r\u00e9torquer \u00e0 cela; toutefois, la malchance n'est pas du harc\u00e8lement.\n[167] Le plaignant et la Commission ont indiqu\u00e9 que les circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce sont dans une certaine mesure similaires \u00e0 celles d\u00e9crites ans les affaires McKinnon v. Ontario (Ministry of Correctional Services) (No. 3) (1988), 32 C.H.R.R. 1 (comm. d'enq. de l'Ont.) et Hinds c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'immigration) (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. 5683. Je ne suis tout simplement pas d'accord : les probl\u00e8mes en l'esp\u00e8ce sont imputables en fin de compte au plaignant plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 l'employeur. N'importe quel gestionnaire raisonnable en serait \u00e9ventuellement venu \u00e0 la conclusion que M. Hill et M. Ryan devaient \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9s, peu importe o\u00f9 se situait le bl\u00e2me dans leurs relations conflictuelles. En fait, Canadien a fait ce constat lors de la r\u00e9union pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re tenue dans la foul\u00e9e de l'incident du 18 octobre 1994 et a offert \u00e0 M. Hill une autre affectation. \u00c0 mon avis, il n'est pas raisonnable que M. Hill exige de retirer M. Ryan de la ligne des Dash-80.\nE. La nature fondamentale des droits de la personne [168] Il est maintenant reconnu, au Canada comme ailleurs, que la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re fondamental. Toutefois, il est important \u00e0 mon avis de pr\u00e9ciser que cette l\u00e9gislation s'applique au domaine civil. La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne vise pas simplement le gouvernement; elle r\u00e9git \u00e9galement les rapports entre individus, qui ont traditionnellement \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 un tel examen. Elle s'applique naturellement au milieu de travail : les employ\u00e9s ont droit \u00e0 un milieu de travail o\u00f9 l'on reconna\u00eet leur dignit\u00e9 et leur valeur intrins\u00e8ques, et l'employeur a le devoir de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination et le harc\u00e8lement. Ce droit est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence comme une condition d'emploi.\n[169] Il s'ensuit qu'un grand nombre de plaintes dont sont saisis les tribunaux des droits de la personne originent du milieu de travail. Cela est normal. La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne traite n\u00e9anmoins de droits plus fondamentaux et ne doit pas \u00eatre vue simplement comme un autre palier d'appel ou de r\u00e9vision dans le domaine des relations du travail. Je reconnais que les plaintes dont je suis saisi semblent mettre en cause de tels droits. Toutefois, lorsqu'on y regarde de plus pr\u00e8s, on constate que le litige en l'esp\u00e8ce r\u00e9side d'abord et avant tout dans un conflit de personnalit\u00e9 entre l'employ\u00e9 et le personnel cadre. Ce litige soul\u00e8ve de s\u00e9rieux probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au milieu de travail qui rel\u00e8vent davantage du domaine des relations du travail que de celui des droits de la personne.\n[170] La l\u00e9gislation sur le harc\u00e8lement tient compte dans une certaine mesure de ces pr\u00e9occupations. Dans Rampersandsingh c. Wignall, D.T. 13\/02; 2002\/11\/26, on peut lire au paragraphe 45 que ce Tribunal a soutenu qu'un certain s\u00e9rieux \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir que le harc\u00e8lement est \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte. Dans ce cas-l\u00e0, le membre instructeur a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'affaire Habachi c. Commission des droits de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec, [1999] R.J.Q. 2522, R.E.J.B. 1999-14361, [1999] J.Q. no 4269 (Q.L.) (C.A.Q.), o\u00f9 la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec a soutenu que la notion juridique de harc\u00e8lement ne devrait pas \u00eatre banalis\u00e9e en faisant en sorte que des diff\u00e9rends courants en mati\u00e8re de relations du travail puissent \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 l'examen des tribunaux des droits de la personne. Il faut quelque chose de plus pour pouvoir invoquer de tels droits fondamentaux.\n[171] Le m\u00eame genre de pr\u00e9occupations existent en l'esp\u00e8ce. Une plainte relative aux droits de la personne met en jeu des int\u00e9r\u00eats publics qui vont au-del\u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s des parties. L'ironie est peut-\u00eatre que M. Hill a formul\u00e9 une plainte g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, dont je ne suis pas saisi. Je ne puis dire quel traitement aurait re\u00e7u cette plainte ni si elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, mais elle aurait certes d\u00e9bord\u00e9 le cadre d'un litige priv\u00e9. Je n'entends pas, par ailleurs, minimiser l'importance de ce qui est survenu aux participants. Cependant, je ne crois pas que les rapports personnels entre M. Hill et M. Ryan soul\u00e8vent le genre de question fondamentale qui doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente tribune. L'expertise du Tribunal r\u00e9side dans le domaine des droits de la personne et non dans celui des relations du travail.\n[172] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination a rapport en fait \u00e0 l'attribution des t\u00e2ches aux \u00e9quipes. On trouve ce genre de plaintes dans tout milieu de travail et il est facile de les exag\u00e9rer. Il est impossible de scruter chaque aspect du travail confi\u00e9 \u00e0 un employ\u00e9, particuli\u00e8rement lorsque les \u00e9v\u00e9nements pertinents sont survenus il y a plus de dix ans. Une certaine masse critique, pour ainsi dire, est n\u00e9cessaire pour justifier une plainte. Je ne vois rien de tel en l'esp\u00e8ce. Je ne vois pas le genre de question d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu'on s'attendrait de voir dans une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant un tribunal des droits de la personne.\nIV. ORDONNANCE [173] Dans les circonstances, le plaignant et la Commission n'ont pas \u00e9tabli selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s que M. Hill avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de discrimination ou de harc\u00e8lement chez Canadien durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente. Les plaintes sont donc rejet\u00e9es.\n[174] Je voudrais ajouter une derni\u00e8re remarque. \u00c0 la fin de l'audience, j'avais indiqu\u00e9 aux parties que je m'efforcerais de rendre ma d\u00e9cision dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais. Je tiens \u00e0 leur pr\u00e9senter mes excuses, car d'autres questions ont exig\u00e9 mon attention.\nOriginal sign\u00e9 par\nPaul Groarke\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 18 f\u00e9vrier 2003\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL No : T677\/6501\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Yul F.
