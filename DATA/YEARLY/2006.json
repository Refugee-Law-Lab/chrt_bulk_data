Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion to dismiss a complaint against the Canadian Museum of Civilization (the Museum) without a hearing. The complaint involves allegations by the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) that the job evaluation plan used by the Museum was gender-biased and contrary to sections 10 and 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[2] The Museum contends that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint because the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) has withdrawn a report which was the basis for the Commission's decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal.\n[3] The report in question was completed by Dr. Lois Haignere of Haignere Inc., an external consultant retained by the Commission during the investigation of the complaint, to examine whether gender bias existed in the Museum's job evaluation plan. In her report, Dr. Haignere concluded that the plan was likely gender-biased. The Commission investigator adopted Dr. Haignere's conclusions and recommended that a Tribunal inquiry into the complaint be requested. The Museum and PSAC were provided with an opportunity to respond to the Investigator's report.\n[4] On the basis of all the material before it, including the Investigator's report and Dr. Haignere's Report, the Commission decided to refer the complaint to the Tribunal for further inquiry. The referral was made on April 1, 2004.\n[5] In May, 2005, after the Tribunal had instituted an inquiry and heard preliminary motions on the matter, the Commission advised the Tribunal and the other parties that it would not be calling Dr. Haignere as a witness. At that time, the Commission also informed the parties that it was looking into retaining another expert.\n[6] The Commission subsequently informed the parties and the Tribunal that it had retained Dr. Nan Weiner to prepare a report. A copy of this report was provided to the parties. In it, Dr. Weiner stated that while there was some gender bias in the Museum's job evaluation plan and process, it was likely not significant.\n[7] The Museum contends that the Commission's decision not to call Dr. Haignere as a witness during the hearing means that it has effectively withdrawn the Haignere report. Since the basis of the decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal was the Haignere report, the withdrawal of that report constitutes the effective withdrawal of the complaint. The Museum asserts that the Commission has the authority and indeed, an obligation to withdraw a complaint in circumstances such as the present ones. Therefore, the Museum urges this Tribunal to find that when the Commission decided not to call Dr. Haignere to testify it effectively exercised its authority to withdraw the complaint.\n[8] In the alternative, the Museum argues that the referral of the complaint to the Tribunal is invalid. The Weiner report does not conclusively determine that gender bias existed in the Museum's job evaluation plan. Therefore, the foundation for the Commission's decision to refer the complaint to this Tribunal has been removed. Without this foundation, it is argued, the Commission's decision to refer the complaint is invalid and therefore, by extension, the Tribunal's jurisdiction to inquire into the complaint is invalidated.\nI. THE ISSUES [9] The issues in this motion are as follows:\nDid the Commission withdraw the Haignere report and thereby effectively withdraw the complaint? Do the Commission's actions and decisions with regard to the reports affect the Tribunal's jurisdiction to inquire into the complaint?\n[10] For the reasons that follow, I find that the answer to both questions is `no'. Therefore, I must dismiss the Museum's motion.\nII. ANALYSIS A. Did the Commission withdraw the Haignere report and thereby effectively withdraw the complaint? [11] The cornerstone of the Museum's motion to dismiss the complaint is the contention that the Commission has withdrawn the Haignere Report. However, an examination of the record reveals no indication that the Haignere Report has been withdrawn. During a case conference on this matter on May 11, 2005, counsel for the Commission stated that the Commission will not be calling Lois Haignere. Commission counsel also indicated that he would be looking at calling another expert to testify at the hearing.\n[12] The Commission subsequently retained Dr. Nan Weiner to produce a Report and to testify at the hearing. Dr. Weiner's Report was disclosed. The Commission then indicated that it intended to call Dr. Weiner to testify instead of Dr. Haignere.\n[13] In my view, the Commission's decision not to call Dr. Haignere as a witness during the hearing does not constitute a withdrawal of the Haignere Report. It is simply a decision by the Commission about the witnesses it will and will not be calling to testify at the hearing.\n[14] As a party to the inquiry, the Commission is entitled to make decisions and take positions during the hearing which, in its opinion, are in the public interest (Canadian Human Rights Act, s. 51). Such decisions regarding the public interest are left to the discretion of the Commission. This includes decisions about the evidence it will or will not lead, the arguments it will make and even whether it will participate in the hearing.\n[15] There is nothing in the Act that compels the Commission, as a party to the Tribunal proceedings, to make decisions and take positions which are consistent with the investigator's findings or other pre-referral reports. The Tribunal's inquiry is a de novo process during which the parties are free to take positions and make decisions based on their interests provided these positions have been disclosed in advance in accordance with the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. Thus, the Commission's decision to call Dr. Weiner to testify instead of Dr. Haignere cannot be interpreted as a constructive withdrawal of the Haignere Report.\n[16] Moreover, even if it could be said that the Haignere report was effectively withdrawn when the Commission decided to call Dr. Weiner as a witness instead of Dr. Haignere, this could not be taken to mean that the Commission has withdrawn the complaint.\n[17] The Commission does not have the authority to unilaterally withdraw a complaint once a referral to the Tribunal has been made. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the complainant has an independent right to proceed with the complaint regardless of the actions taken by the Commission (See: Premakumar v. Air Canada, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 17 at para. 27 (CHRT); and McKenzie Forest Products Inc. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission) (2000) 48 O.R. (3d) 150 at para. 34 (C.A.)).\n[18] As this Tribunal stated in Ct v. Attorney General of Canada (Representing R.C.M.P.), 2003 CHRT 32 at para. 12, the complaint belongs to the complainant, not the Commission. Thus, even if the Commission decides to withdraw from the proceedings, the complainant is entitled to proceed with the hearing and the Tribunal's jurisdiction is unaffected. This ensures that complainants retain control over the enforcement of their statutory rights.\n[19] In the present case, the complainant, PSAC, is clearly prepared to proceed with the case regardless of the actions and decisions taken by the Commission. PSAC states that it has retained an expert who has analyzed the Museum's job evaluation plan and has found evidence of gender bias. Therefore, PSAC is insisting that the Tribunal fulfill its obligation under s. 50(1) of the Act to provide it with a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make representations.\n[20] The Museum's response to this is that the Commission's authority to withdraw the complaint is subject to PSAC's right to bring a separate motion to establish its private interest in proceeding with the complaint. According to the Museum, if the complainant can resist the withdrawal of the complaint by bringing a motion for the Tribunal's permission to proceed, then there is no inconsistency between the Commission's ongoing obligation to screen complaints throughout the inquiry and the complainant's right to be heard.\n[21] However, in my view, it is clearly not consistent with the goals of the Act to require complainants to bring a motion to defend their right to be heard by the Tribunal. Such a requirement would place an additional burden on complainants and might well have the effect of discouraging them from pursuing their rights under the Act. Therefore, the Museum's arguments in that regard must be rejected.\n[22] The second reason that the Commission does not in fact, have an ongoing obligation to screen complaints and to withdraw them in the appropriate circumstances after the referral is that at that point, it becomes the responsibility of the Tribunal, not the Commission, to decide whether the complaint has any merit. Like the Tribunal in Premakumar, I find the Ontario Court of Appeal's analysis in McKenzie Forest Products Inc, regarding the handling of human rights complaints in the Ontario context to be applicable in the federal jurisdiction (Premakumar, supra, at para. 27).\n[23] Once the Commission has decided to refer the matter to the Tribunal for further inquiry, its decision-making role is over. The Tribunal then assumes the exclusive authority for determining whether the evidence supports the complainant's position or not. Thus, after the referral has been made, the Commission can neither reconsider its decision nor unilaterally withdraw the complaint because to do so would usurp the Tribunal's function as the adjudicative body in the human rights process.\n[24] For these reasons, I decline to follow the obiter dicta of the Tribunal in Kamani v. Canada Post Corporation (1993), 23 C.H.R.R. D\/98 at para's. 30 and 33, and Sehmi v. Canada (VIA Rail), [1995] C.H.R.D. No. 9 as was suggested to me by counsel for the Museum. Moreover, I disagree that the Grover case constitutes an endorsement by the Federal Court of the Commission's authority to withdraw a complaint or to reconsider its decision to refer the complaint to Tribunal (Canada (Attorney General) v. Grover 2004 FC 704 at para. 45). It is clear from the context in that case that when the Federal Court quoted the Tribunal's comments in Kamani, it was to underscore the Commission's pre-referral obligation to complete a careful and thorough investigation.\n[25] Moreover, I disagree with the Museum that the case of British Columbia (Police Complaint Commissioner) v. Vancouver (City) Police 2003 BCSC 279 is applicable to the present circumstances. The legislative context in the B.C. case is different. In that case, the Court found that pursuant to the Police Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 367, the Police Complaint Commissioner was effectively the complainant and therefore, had the power to unilaterally withdraw the complaint. The same does not hold in the context of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Under the Act, the role of the Commission is clearly distinct from that of the complainant. The complainant has the power to unilaterally withdraw a complaint. The Commission, however, does not have this power.\nB. Do the Commission's actions and decisions with regard to the Weiner and Haignere reports affect the Tribunal's jurisdiction to inquire into the complaint? [26] In my view, the post-referral disclosure of the Weiner report has no effect whatsoever on the Tribunal's jurisdiction to inquire into the complaint.\n[27] The Commission makes a decision to refer a complaint to the Tribunal based on the information available to it at the time. If a party is of the view that the Commission's decision is invalid, the only recourse is to apply for judicial review of the decision in the Federal Court of Canada. The Tribunal has no authority under the Act to question the validity of the Commission's decision to refer a complaint to it. This authority falls within the exclusive purview of the Federal Court. (International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Maritime Section), Local 400 v. Oster, 2001 FCT 1115 at para. 29; Tweten v. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd. 2004 CHRT 8 at para.17)\n[28] Thus, even if it could be said that the Haignere Report was replaced by the Weiner Report, the Tribunal could not make a determination as to whether such action invalidated the referral. Rather, barring a successful application for judicial review of the Commission's decision, the Tribunal is required to proceed with an inquiry into the complaint.\n[29] The Museum argues that the Commission's statutory authority to request an inquiry is limited to the complaint to which the report relates (s. 44 of the Act). Therefore, by extension, the Tribunal's jurisdiction is limited to the complaint to which the report relates. Since the report in this case effectively means the Haignere report, and the Commission has decided not to call the author of this report, the Museum contends that the Tribunal is without jurisdiction to proceed any further.\n[30] The Museum's arguments in this regard are not consistent with the Federal Court of Appeal's statements in Bell Canada v. Communications, Energy and Paperworkers' Union of Canada, [1999] 1 F.C. 113 at para. 37 (F.C.A.). In that case, the Court of Appeal held that in inquiring into the complaint, the Tribunal is in no way bound by the investigator's report even if the report is adopted by the Commission as the reasons for its decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal. The Court declared that the Tribunal is an autonomous body that exercises its adjudicative functions independently of the Commission. It follows that even though the Haignere report was adopted by the investigator and relied upon by the Commission in reaching its decision, the Tribunal is not bound by it. Similarly, the Commission's decision not to call Dr. Haignere as a witness during the hearing does not affect the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n[31] I find the reasons of the Ontario Board of Inquiry in Shepherd v. Ontario Corp. 1110494 (2000), 38 C.H.R.R. D\/284 regarding the effect of a potentially invalid referral upon the Board's jurisdiction to be illuminating. In that case, the Ontario Human Rights Commission argued that, as a result of a procedural error in the referral process, its decision to refer the complaint was a nullity. The Board refused to accept this argument stating that the Commission's characterization of its defect as a nullity does not operate to nullify the Board's jurisdiction (Shepherd, supra, at para. 13). The Board stated that if it terminated the inquiry and closed the file in that case, it would be abrogating its statutory duty to hold a hearing (Shepherd, supra, at para. 19).\n[32] In my view, the same reasoning applies in the federal context. Once a referral has been made, in the absence of circumstances giving rise to an abuse of process, the Act requires that an inquiry be held into the complaint (See: s. 49(2), Canadian Human Rights Act, and Tweten, supra, at para. 16). There is no evidence of any circumstances giving rise to an abuse of process in the present case.\n[33] Therefore, the inquiry into the complaint must proceed.\nIII.

INTRODUCTION\nII. BACKGROUND\nIII. ARGUMENTS\nIV. ANALYSIS\nV. THE LAW\nVI. RULING\n[1] This is a ruling on Respondent's objection to the introduction by the Complainant of evidence on the selection process leading to the appointment of Dr. Timothy Scott to the position of Director, BVD\nI. INTRODUCTION [2] The Respondent, Health Canada, hereafter HC, objects to evidence being tendered by the Complainant in the present proceedings concerning the appointment, in 1995, of Dr. Timothy Scott as Director of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, hereafter BVD. Respondent argues that anything pertaining to the selection process for the BVD Director position has already been decided in a previous decision of this Tribunal.\n[3] In addition, the Respondent argues that any issue revolving around Dr. Scott's appointment should have been raised in the course of the hearings regarding Dr. Chopra's 1992 complaint.\n[4] In support of its position, the Respondent relies on the doctrine of res judicata, issue estoppel and abuse of process.\n[5] For his part, the Complainant argues that the events he wants to introduce in evidence were not the object of any decision by this Tribunal. These events pertain to what took place after corrective measures were implemented at the end of 1994 with respect to the selection process pertaining to the position of Director, BVD.\n[6] In order to rule on Respondent's objection, there is a need for the Tribunal to describe the facts that have led to Respondent's objection.\nII. BACKGROUND [7] On September 16, 1992, Dr. Chopra filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. His complaint was later referred to the Tribunal. It was first heard by a three member panel (Soberman Panel) which dismissed Dr. Chopra's complaint.\n[8] The record shows that, after a judicial review, Dr. Chopra's 1992 complaint was the object of a second hearing by this Tribunal. Tribunal Member Hadjis was assigned to hear the case on the basis of the record, augmented by certain additional evidence.\n[9] In his 1992 complaint, Dr. Chopra alleged that he had been treated unfairly in the manner in which his performance appraisals were prepared during the 1990 to 1992 period and that he received this treatment because of his color, race and national or ethnic origin. More specifically, Dr. Chopra complained that he had been discriminated against in the selection process leading to the appointment of Dr. Claire Franklin as Director, Bureau of Human Prescription Drugs, hereafter BHPD.\n[10] In the course of the hearing presided by Mr. Hadjis, Counsel for the Commission referred to events that occurred outside the 1990-1992 period. One of these events was the appointment, in December 1993, of Dr. Timothy Scott to the position of Director, BVD. This evidence was tendered, it appears from Mr. Hadjis' decision, as evidence of ongoing discrimination at HC (Chopra v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 20, para. 136, hereafter the Hadjis decision).\n[11] Even though this event was not part of the initial facts set out in Dr. Chopra's 1992 complaint, Mr. Hadjis went on to deal with the December 1993 competition that led to the appointment of Dr. Scott (Hadjis decision, para. 141 and following). The following facts were considered by Mr. Hadjis.\n[12] In December 1993, a competition was held within HC for the position of Director, BVD. Dr. Chopra applied for the position and was screened out. Another individual, Dr. Casorso, who had also applied for the position, was not chosen.\n[13] Dr. Chopra as well as Dr. Casorso appealed the appointment of Dr. Scott as Director, BVD, to the Public Service Commission Appeal Board, hereafter the PSCAB. Dr. Chopra's appeal was dismissed while Dr. Casorso's appeal was allowed on the basis that the Screening Board had not properly considered his candidacy in relation to the experience requirements that were established by the Department for this position.\n[14] Following the PSCAB decision, HC took corrective measures to address the Appeal Board's finding in the Casorso matter in respect of the selection process for the position of Director, BVD.\n[15] The criteria which required recent experience in managing a scientific or medical or veterinary organization with multifaceted programs was eliminated. Furthermore, HC ordered that candidates who had been screened out on the basis that they did not have experience as a departmental representative with outside organizations or management experience should be reassessed.\n[16] Thus a new competition was held and at the end of the process and, on February 28, 1995, Dr. Scott was confirmed as Director, BVD effective March 13, 1995.\nIII. ARGUMENTS [17] Counsel for the Complainant argues that, after the implementation of the corrective measures following Dr. Casorso's successful appeal, Dr. Chopra was not considered for the position of Director, BVD and was, in fact, completely ignored. According to Counsel for the Complainant, this lends support to Dr. Chopra's claim of discrimination.\n[18] Counsel for the Complainant further argues that the events that occurred after the corrective measures were implemented are events that were not addressed by Mr. Hadjis in his decision and, thus, should be part of the issues to be decided by the Tribunal in the present proceedings. Counsel for the Complainant, however, conceded that the findings of Mr. Hadjis in relation to the 1993 competition for the position of Director, BVD should stand.\n[19] Counsel for the Respondent argues, on the contrary, that Mr. Hadjis' decision covers every aspect of the 1993 competition which led to the appointment of Dr. Scott to the position of Director, BVD. He relies on the doctrine of res judicata, issue estoppel and abuse of process to support his argument that evidence concerning the appointment of Dr. Scott should not be heard by this Tribunal.\n[20] Counsel for the Respondent further argues that Dr. Chopra could have complained about the fact that he was not considered in the second competition for the position of Director, BVD, in the course of the hearings of his 1992 complaint.\n[21] Firstly, Counsel for the Respondent underscores the fact that Dr. Chopra's 1992 complaint was heard by the Soberman Panel in September and October 1995, well after Dr. Scott's appointment to the position of Director, BVD in February 1995. Secondly, Counsel for the Respondent submits that the issue should have been fully litigated before the Hadjis Tribunal when it heard Dr. Chopra's 1992 complaint in 1999 and 2000.\n[22] Counsel for the Respondent argues that, to permit or authorize the litigation of this issue - i.e. Dr. Chopra not being considered in the second competition for the position of Director, BVD, would constitute an abuse of process.\nIV. ANALYSIS [23] The first hearing of Dr. Chopra's 1992 complaint by the Soberman Panel took place in September and October of 1995. Respondent argues that any discrimination issue in relation to Dr. Scott's appointment should have been dealt with at that time.\n[24] This view ignores the fact that Dr. Chopra's 1992 complaint purported to cover events that occurred in the 1990 to 1992 period, more specifically those related to the staffing of the position of Director, BHPD between September 1990 and the spring of 1992 (Hadjis decision, para. 2). It is only in the course of the Hadjis hearing, which went from May 17, 1999 to December 11,2000, that the competition pertaining to the staffing of the position of Director, BVD in December 1993 was raised as an additional fact to be considered by Mr. Hadjis.\n[25] It is worth noting here that, in his decision, Mr. Hadjis refers to the fact that during final arguments in the re-hearing of Dr. Chopra's 1992 complaint, there was some debate between counsel as to the parameters of the inquiry into the 1992 complaint since much of the evidence adduced by the Commission at the re-hearing went beyond the matters specifically referred to in the complaint (Hadjis decision, para. 254).\n[26] After having carefully reviewed the submissions of all the parties, including Dr. Chopra himself, Mr. Hadjis concluded that all the evidence could be assessed by him for its value as circumstantial evidence in support of the key aspect of the complaint, that is the staffing of the position of Director of BHPD, in the 1990 to 1992 period (Hadjis decision, para. 254). Earlier in his decision, Mr. Hadjis identified as the events at the core of Dr. Chopra's complaint those which occurred during the 1990 to 1992 period (Hadjis decision, para. 82).\n[27] It therefore appears that what was at the heart of Dr. Chopra's 1992 complaint was the staffing of the position of Director, BHPD and that the additional evidence adduced was circumstantial evidence in support of the key aspect of the Complaint, i.e. the staffing of the position of Director, BHPD. The 1993 competition thus appears not to have been fundamental to the Hadjis proceedings (see Joss v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1999] F.C.J. No 1819 (QL) (T.D.)).\n[28] This said, the Tribunal cannot, however, ignore the fact that, in his decision, Mr. Hadjis did make findings of fact in connection with allegations of discrimination related to events which were outside the 1990-1992 period, namely the appointment of Dr. Scott to the position of Director, BVD.\n[29] In this respect, Mr. Hadjis found that Dr. Chopra was not the victim of adverse differential treatment with regard to the December 1993 competition for the position of Director, BVD. Mr. Hadjis further found that no evidence was adduced indicating that Dr. Chopra did, in fact, possess the qualification of experience in dealing with outside organizations (Hadjis decision, para. 288). On this basis, Mr. Hadjis concluded that Dr. Chopra was not qualified for the position and that there was no prima facie case of discrimination.\n[30] Even if these findings can be said to be only incidental to the core issue which Mr. Hadjis had to decide, i.e. the staffing of the position of Director, BHPD, they still remain findings of fact made by Mr. Hadjis that I cannot ignore.\n[31] In a preliminary decision related to the present proceedings, Tribunal Member Dr. Groarke expressed the view that the alleged failure to appoint Dr. Chopra to the position of Director, BVD in 1993 had already been litigated. On this point, Dr. Groake indicated in his ruling that the Hadjis Tribunal received evidence relating to the events that took place between 1992 and 1994 and expressed the view that this evidence, presented by the Commission on behalf of Dr. Chopra, clearly formed part of Dr. Chopra's case.\n[32] As true as these statements may be, I cannot infer from Dr. Groarke's ruling that the events that occurred after the PSCAB decision on the Casorso appeal form part of Mr. Hadjis decision.\n[33] The Tribunal thus finds:\nthat the period covered by the complaint filed by Dr. Chopra in 1992 was that of 1990 to 1992, more precisely September 16, 1992, the date of the filing of the complaint;\nthat, the staffing of the position of Director, BHPD was at the core of the 1992 complaint;\nthat additional allegations of discrimination were raised in the course of the second hearing by Mr. Hadjis of the 1992 complaint, notably allegations of discrimination in relation to the selection process of December 1993 leading to the appointment of Dr. Scott as Director, BVD;\nthat these allegations, although incidental and not part of the scope of the complaint filed in 1992, led to certain findings of fact by Mr. Hadjis;\nthat these findings cannot be ignored by the Tribunal but must be put in the context of the 1992 complaint and of Mr. Hadjis' analysis of the December 1993 competition.\n[34] In his analysis of the evidence pertaining to the 1993 competition (Hadjis decision, para. 141-142), Mr. Hadjis only considered the facts related to the initial competition. He did not deal with the corrective measures that were implemented after Dr. Casorso was successful in his appeal. Nor did he deal with the events that took place after the implementation of these corrective measures and with any allegation of discrimination related to events that followed the implementation of the corrective measures.\n[35] The Tribunal therefore finds that events which took place after the PSAB decision in November 1994 were not considered, nor decided, by Mr. Hadjis in his decision. His findings of fact are limited to the initial 1993 competition and do not the cover the overall process pertaining to the staffing of the position of Director, BVD.\n[36] On this point, the Tribunal disagrees with Respondent's assertion that the corrective measures put in place after the Casorso decision are subsumed in the overall selection process of a Director for the BVD, process which started in December 1993 and ended in February 1995 with the confirmation of Dr. Scott as Director, BVD.\nV. THE LAW [37] Applying to these findings the law on res judicata and issue estoppel (see Angle v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), [1975], 2 S.C.R. 248, QL, page 4), the Tribunal concludes:\nthat the first criterion set out by Lord Guest in Carl Zeiss Stiftung, as cited in Angle, has not been met, i.e. that the same question raised in the present proceeding has already been decided by a previous tribunal;\nthat issues related to allegations of discrimination arising after the PSCAB decision of November 1994 were not addressed by the Hadjis tribunal;\nthat it cannot be inferred that these issues are subsumed in the findings of Mr. Hadjis on the initial competition pertaining to the selection of a Director, BVD;\nthat there is no abuse of process on the part of the Complainant.\n[38] Even if I had come to a different conclusion, i.e. that the three pre-conditions for issue estoppel to apply had been met, I would have refused, using my judicial discretion (Danyluk v.

THE COMPLAINT [1] The complainant, Richard Warman, has filed a complaint alleging that in 2001 and 2002, the respondents, Alexan Kulbashian and James Scott Richardson, communicated messages over the Internet that exposed individuals who are non-Christian, non-Caucasian, or of other national ethnic origins, to hatred or contempt, contrary to s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. In his complaint form, Mr. Warman named three additional respondents, identified as Tri-City Skins.com, Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (CECT), and Affordable Space.com.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) fully participated at the hearing into the complaint and was represented by legal counsel. Neither Mr. Warman nor the respondents were represented by legal counsel, though it should be noted that Mr. Warman is a lawyer by profession. Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson were present at the hearing but neither of them opted to testify or call any witnesses after the close of the Commission's and Complainant's cases. Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson introduced some documents into evidence through their cross-examination of Commission witnesses.\n[3] The other three named respondents did not formally appear at the hearing, although Mr. Warman and the Commission allege that Mr. Kulbashian and\/or Mr. Richardson are closely linked to these respondents. I will be dealing with this issue in due course, later in the decision.\nII. WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES GAVE RISE TO THIS COMPLAINT? [4] Mr. Warman is a resident of Ottawa. He has developed an interest in human rights issues over the past 15 years, and is actively involved in anti-racism groups. For a time, he worked for the Commission. Most recently, he has focussed his attention on hate propaganda disseminated through the Internet, by monitoring the Internet activity of what he describes as extreme right-wing and neo-Nazi groups.\n[5] In 2001, Mr. Warman started monitoring the websites of two groups, the Tri-City Skins and the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, both of which were allegedly based in south-western Ontario. According to Mr. Warman, their websites were respectively Tri-cityskins.com and wpcect.com (an abbreviation for White Power - Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team). After conducting some research, Mr. Warman also determined that both of these websites were made available on the Internet through the web hosting services that were provided by the respondent firm, Affordable Space.com. He also believed that both Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson were involved in the operation of Tri-cityskins.com, wpcect.com, and Affordable Space.com. In Mr. Warman's view, the material found on the websites violated s. 13 of the Act, so he filed the present complaint on February 5, 2002.\n[6] The websites in question were no longer available on the Internet at the time of the hearing into the complaint.\nIII. WHAT QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS CASE? [7] I must address the following questions in this case:\nIs material sent over the Internet a communication within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act? What was the Internet material that Mr. Warman alleges violates s. 13 of the Act? Was this material likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? Did Mr. Kulbashian or Mr. Richardson, alone or in concert with each other or others, communicate this material repeatedly, or cause it to be so communicated? Has the complaint been substantiated against the other named respondents (Tri-City Skins.com, Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (CECT) and Affordable Space.com)?\n[8] As I explain in this decision, I find that the material in question constitutes hate messages as contemplated by s. 13 of the Act, and that Mr. Richardson as well as Mr. Kulbashian and his firm, Affordable Space.com, were involved in various ways in the communication of these messages. I also find that the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team is a group of persons acting in concert that was responsible for conveying some of these messages, and is therefore in contravention of s. 13, as well. On the other hand, there is no evidence that tri-cityskins.com was anything more than the name of a website. It is not a person or group of persons acting in concert within the meaning of s. 13. As a result, I find that the complaint against the respondent identified as Tri-City Skins.com has not been substantiated.\nA. Question 1 - Is material sent over the Internet a communication within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act? [9] Section 13 was originally enacted well before the pervasive global growth of the Internet, and there was no mention of the Internet to be found in the provision itself. In 2001, however, s. 13(2) was amended by the Anti-Terrorism Act, S.C. 2001, c.41, s. 88, to provide that, for greater certainty, the proscribed discriminatory practice extended to matter that is communicated by means of a computer or a group of interconnected or related computers, including the Internet. This amendment came into force on December 23, 2001 (P.C. 2001-2425, SI\/2002-16, Canada Gazette Part II, Vol. 136, No. 1).\n[10] Mr. Warman viewed the material that is the object of his complaint, on the Internet, in 2001 and 2002, before and after the coming into force of the enactment amending s. 13. As the Tribunal in Warman v. Kyburz 2003 CHRT 18, 43 C.H.R.R D\/425 (C.H.R.T.) at para. 15 (Kyburz) noted, however, whether or not any of the communications occurred before the amendment is ultimately of no consequence. The earlier version of s. 13 was found to encompass Internet communications in both Citron v. Z\u00fcndel (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/274 (C.H.R.T.), and in Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Meprizer Inc. et al. (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/453 (C.H.R.T.). In my view, the issue is now settled. Matter that was communicated over the Internet, whether before or after the amendments, is subject to s. 13 of the Act.\nB. Question 2 - What is the Internet material that allegedly violates s. 13? (i) Material on the tri-cityskins.com website [11] The Commission produced copies of web pages from the tri-cityskins.com website that Mr. Warman testified having viewed between October 2001 and February 2002. The Internet address of the home page was www.tri-cityskins.com. A copy of the home page, printed out on February 2, 2002, was entered into evidence.\n[12] The page has a banner at the top stating, Tri-City Skins Website is BACK, followed by a warning that Contained in these pages are views that many will find offensive. WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK!!!. Mr. Warman testified that by clicking on the word enter at the bottom of the page, he was redirected to the Main page. A banner at the top of the Main page said Tri-City Skins - Welcome to Our Official Website. Between two Canadian flags, the word Skinheads appears, near the top. On the left side of the page is a column of icons (or links) that when clicked, send the visitor to other parts of the website. One of those links connected to a part of the website that itself provided links to Good Sites, which included the sites for the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, the Toronto Skinheads, the Heritage Front, and the White Aryan Resistance. There is also a link to a site called www.whitesonly.net. The icon that linked you to this site consisted of a rope with nooses at both ends along with the phrase Bring Your Nigger...We Got the Rope.\n[13] Another page on the tri-cityskins.com website that could be accessed by clicking a link button on the main page, is entitled ...Of the Month. This linked page sets out featured songs, quotes, sites, jokes, and pictures of the month. The December 2001 joke of the month was:\nWhat do you call 6 nigger's [sic] hanging from a tree??\nAn Alabama wind chime.\n[14] The picture of the month contained two photos; one of a man wearing a type of turban, accompanied by the description This is a Sikh, and another photo, this time of a bearded man carrying a farm animal, also wearing a similar form of headdress, with the description This is a Muslim. Both photos were followed by the following caption:\nPlease beat accordingly.\nBrought to you by the Don't Beat a Sikh foundation.\n[15] The tri-cityskins.com website contained several pages devoted to jokes, which are entitled Nigger Jokes, Jew Jokes, and Other Ethnic Jokes. All could be accessed by clicking the Joke Page link from the Main page. The Commission filed copies that were viewed and printed out by Mr. Warman on October 13, 2001. There are numerous entries found on these pages. These are only a few examples of the jokes found on the Nigger Jokes page:\nQ: What has four fuzzy legs and one black arm?\nA: A happy pitbull.\nQ: Why are a nigger's eyes red after sex?\nA: Mace.\nQ: What's missing from the unemployment line in Harlem?\nA: 100 ft of chain, and an auctioneer.\nThe Jew Jokes web page contains about 25 entries, beginning with the following:\nQ: What was the best thing to ever come out of Auschwitz?\nA: An empty train.\nQ: What did the German kid get for Christmas?\nA: G.I. Jew and an easy bake oven.\nQ: How do you fit 100 Jews into a Volkswagen?\nA: Two in the front, three in the back, and 95 in the ashtray.\nQ: What's the difference between a Jew and apple pie?\nA: Apple pie doesn't scream when you put it in the oven.\nThe Other Ethnic Jokes page relates to persons of various ethnic backgrounds. The following is a sample:\nQ: What's the most confusing day on the Indian reserve?\nA: Fathers' Day.\nQ: Why doesn't Mexico have a good Olympic team?\nA: Anyone who can run, jump or swim is already in the U.S.\nQ: Why do Pakis stink?\nA: So the blind can hate them too.\n[16] Another page on the tri-cityskins.com website was used to market White Power, Racist, and Skinhead Shirts. Instructions were provided on how to place orders for these shirts and listing the available sizes. The shirts displayed for sale bore inscriptions on the front including Aryan, ACAB - ALL COPS ARE BASTARDS, SKINHEADS, and Aryan Women Unite.\n[17] One also found on the tri-cityskins.com website a page entitled HEROES AND WARRIORS OF OUR MOVEMENT. A printout from December 8, 2001, contains photos of Adolf Hitler, Rudolf Hess, and Ernst Z\u00fcndel, amongst others. In the side margins, the Nazi SS symbol and an Iron Cross with a swastika in the centre are displayed.\n[18] There is a link on the main page of the tri-cityskins.com website entitled Weekly A.D.V. Broadcast - updated. Mr. Warman testified that clicking on this icon brought up a page on the tri-cityskins.com website containing the text of the Weekly American Dissident Voices Broadcast. He produced printouts of five issues of this Broadcast that were posted on the webpage, from August 2001 until February 2002. Each Broadcast consisted of a fairly long article (8 to 13 pages) ostensibly drafted by William Pierce, who, according to Mr. Warman, was the head of the National Alliance, the largest neo-Nazi group in the United States at the time.\n[19] In one Broadcast, Mr. Pierce advises the white citizens of South Africa that the only viable long-range solution for [them] is to get rid of all the Blacks and other non-Whites. They should force them out, sterilize them, kill them - otherwise [they] will lose [their] country. He goes on to state elsewhere in this article:\nIf we want our kind to survive on this planet longer than another generation or two, then we must clear the cobwebs of Christian superstition and Jewish propaganda from our minds and face the facts without being squeamish. One fact is that we must have exclusive possession of those portions of this planet which constitute suitable habitat for us. Another fact is that in order to obtain and maintain that exclusive possession, we must be prepared to kill, to annihilate, any and all competitors. A third fact is that racism is God's gift to any race that wants to survive. Racism is healthy and natural and essential, and we had damned well better clear of [sic] minds of the Judeo-Christian lie that it is evil and wicked and nasty and low-brow.\n(emphasis added)\n[20] In another Broadcast, viewed and printed out by Mr. Warman on October 13, 2001, Mr. Pierce describes the Clinton administration as the most Jewish government America ever had, which he then contrasts to the administration of George W. Bush:\nThe people out front, in the public's eye, are Gentiles - of a sort: a mulatto secretary of state, a White gentile secretary of defence, a Negress as a national security adviser, a White Gentile Treasury secretary - and, except for Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, no really prominent Jews. That is, there are few Jews out front, where they can be seen. But the Jews are there, just as in the Clinton government, but working behind the scenes.\n[21] In a subsequent Broadcast, viewed by Mr. Warman on January 22, 2002, entitled The Culture of Lies, Mr. Pierce dismisses what he refers to as the so-called Holocaust and the central myth of `six million' innocent, blameless Jews killed in `gas ovens' by the wicked Nazis. He ends the article by writing about Jewish media control in America that has allowed the culture of lies to prevail.\n[22] Another Broadcast, which Mr. Warman viewed on February 2, 2002, referred to Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz. Mr. Pierce wrote:\nFundamentally, he's not a lawyer or a civil libertarian; he's not an American; he's not even a fellow human being. Alan Dershowitz is a Jew, and that says it all.\n[23] The article goes on to criticize Mr. Dershowitz's position allegedly in favour of the use of torture by the U.S. Government to obtain confessions following the 9\/11 attacks, by stating:\nBut I'll guarantee you that ultimately it's not just Muslims that Dershowitz and his tribe have in mind when they advocate torture; it's you and I; it's everyone who stands in the way of the total supremacy of their tribe.\n(ii) Material on the wpcect.com website a) The Links page [24] The Commission filed with the Tribunal some excerpts from the wpcect.com website, including a copy of the Links page, which was printed out on January 18, 2002. The banner across the Links page reads C.E.C.T., an acronym for Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. To the left of it is a logo comprised of a half-maple leaf and a half-Celtic cross. On the right side is another logo, which is only partially visible on the printout, but appears to resemble a maple leaf superimposed over a swastika.\n[25] On the left side of the page is a column containing the following words: Start, News, Articles, Thoughts, Info, Flyers, Webhosting, Chapters, Newsletter, Contact, and Links. Mr. Warman testified that this column was found on all of wpcect.com's pages. Clicking on the words would open a corresponding page. For instance, clicking on Links from any page on the website would bring you to the Links page that was filed in evidence.\n[26] Down the centre of this Links page is a series of icons that when clicked, connect you to their corresponding websites. These linked sites include tri-cityskins.com, White Aryan Resistance, the American Nazi Party, National Skinhead Front (whitevictory.com), and hatecore88.com. Mr. Warman testified that the number 88 is often used by neo-Nazi groups. The letter H is the 8th letter in the alphabet and 88 (denoting HH) refers to the first letters in the words of the phrase Heil Hitler. There is a heading found above all of these icons, which explains that these linked websites are Domains we are hosting for free.\nb) The Thoughts page [27] Mr. Warman produced a printout of an article entitled Intro to Racial Woes. He had previously viewed it by clicking on the caption identified as Thoughts that was found on the left-side column of the wpcect.com website. On the printout that was filed at the hearing, half the date had been cut off, but Mr. Warman testified that he had viewed and printed out the text on October 13, 2001. It contains the following passage, which relates to immigration policies in Canada:\nOver 35% of illegal aliens are convicted and\/or wanted criminals. You see, now in Canada we don't do background checks on our Future potential citizens. For some strange reason we just let them into the country on the honor system. They are given every opportunity in the world and they just sit back and hope that none of the Third world rejects commit violent crimes such as rape, murder, and even terrorism. Not only are the blacks and Asians polluting our cities with gangs and drugs, they are sleeping with our women and doing everything possible to ensure that the white race does not exist through interracial breeding. They are being followed by young white teens that through the media think it's cool to be black. These wiggers, who I refer to as race traitors, have no idea that they are just a part of the plan that's only purpose is to exterminate the white race.\nThe Jewish media, who control everything that we see and hear through T.V. and radio, heads up this war against us. When, as a united race, will we learn our lesson? Because of recent events over the Millenium's Terrorist's problems, I don't think I need to mention anything about the east Indians. They are filthy and are nothing but bad for a young country like ours. If we keep letting all these alien come into Canada. Don't be surprised if one day Canada isn't known for our great living and beautiful country side, but as a country that aids and abets criminals, and a place where rapists and murders can hide out from the laws of their own country. Wait a minute. That has already happened.\n(emphasis added)\nThe article concludes with the following statement:\n[...] What are you willing to do for your country and the Proud White Race? I for one am willing to go all the way and do whatever it be that is needed of me to do to insure that the white race prevails as I am sure we will.\nThe text is signed:\nWhite Pride Worldwide 14\/88\n-WHITE POWER CANADA: THE REICH WAY!\nc) The newsletter - Vinland Voice [28] Another of the words found on the left-side column of the wpcect.com website is Newsletter. Mr. Warman testified that by clicking on it, he was redirected to a website called vinlandvoice.com. The opening page of that website welcomes the visitor to the homepage of the Vinland Voice, which is described as a newsletter that is meant to reach out to White Canadians and keep them up with issues in their communities. The text goes on to thank the supporters of the Vinland Voice and closes with the expression RAHOWA. Mr. Warman stated in his evidence that this term is used by white supremacist group members to greet each other. It is an acronym for Racial Holy War.\n[29] Mr. Warman testified that when he proceeded further into the vinlandvoice.com website, he came across multi-page newsletters that were apparently published on a weekly basis. The earliest copy of the Vinland Voice newsletter filed in evidence is dated August 30, 2001.\n[30] Mr. Warman explained that when he discovered the Vinland Voice site, he registered himself as a subscriber under a pseudonym, and began receiving the newsletters on a weekly basis, by electronic mail (e-mail). He adopted two methods of compiling the material from the newsletters that he believed offended s. 13 of the Act. In some cases, he cut and pasted the content of the newsletters from their location on the vinlandvoice.com website into a word processing file. In other cases, he simply printed out the e-mail messages containing the newsletters. The copies of the Vinland Voice newsletter that were filed at the hearing were in one or the other of these formats.\n[31] I have no evidence before me to suggest that these copies were inaccurate representations of the actual newsletters communicated through the Internet. As I discuss later in this decision, Terry Wilson, a detective with the police service of London, Ontario, also testified about having viewed these newsletters on the Internet and having received them by e-mail as well. I am satisfied that these exhibits are true depictions of the actual newsletters that were posted on the vinlandvoice.com website.\n[32] Every edition of the Vinland Voice in evidence contained an invitation on the first page to Check out our CECT flyers. The newsletters all ended with a link to www.wpcect.com, ie. the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's website. In some issues, the link was accompanied by the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's combined maple leaf-Celtic cross logo.\n[33] The newsletters often reprinted articles from other news sources, to which some editorial comment was added. For instance, Newsletter no. 3, dated August 30, 2001, reproduced what appears to be a wire service article regarding the arrest in Toronto of an individual who was believed to be a member of an Islamic terrorist group involved in the bombings of U.S. embassies. The excerpt was prefaced by the headline, surprise, surprise, this is why immigration MUST stop!.\n[34] The newsletters also often contained letters and commentary expressing disdain towards members of Anti-Racist Action (ARA). Mr. Warman testified that this is an anti-racist group with chapters throughout North America, whose objective is to combat neo-Nazi and racist groups.\n[35] The writers of the Vinland Voice occasionally wrote pieces regarding some of their personal experiences. For instance, in Newsletter No. 3, there is an unsigned article describing what took place at a birthday party for one of the TCS [Tri-City Skins] boys, held it seems at a bar in Kitchener, Ontario. Several paragraphs into the article, the author writes the following:\n[...] my buddy and I were outside with a few skinbyrds talking and having a smoke when a dumb monkey ass looking nigger came to the bar with a bat. LOL, 1 nigger 1 bat against 15 skins, that's why, and for no other reason, was this nigger particularily stupid. All the rest of the cities sewage chose to stay acros the street. Just as we were about to approach the nigger to show him what he can do with the bat the owner of this fine establishment jumped in and disarmned him, warning us that cops were coming back up the stairs. They were everywhere.\n[sic throughout]\n[36] Mr. Warman opted to highlight Newsletter No. 5 in his testimony. This issue, dated September 14, 2001, dealt extensively with the terrorist attacks in the U.S. that had taken place three days earlier. The opening column's headline was Editor's Voice. The name of the author, at the bottom of the text, was WPCanada. As will be discussed later in this decision, Mr. Warman contends that WPCanada stands for White Power Canada, and that it is in fact a pseudonym used by Mr. Richardson. The article reads as follows:\nHmmmm, Where to start? I have so much to say and the newsletter is already so huge. So I will try to keep it short. As I mentioned above, you will see opinions from many different people and I am defiantly not saying mine is the correct One but it is mine and now you are stuck reading it.\nIf there was ever a time to stand up and have your voice heard, it is now. War is on, and the gloves are off. I have held various opinions since the tragedy in The United States. But even though my anger and views have differed from one extreme to another I still stay focused on one thing. A lot of white folk died tragically, and as always the Jews are mixed up in it. I do not take kindly to innocent whites dying for nothing and especially because of those dirty Jews.\nAnd yes I hold ALL Muslims personally responsible as well. Even the American government, for bringing this war onto American soil by supplying Jews with weapons to destroy the Muslims. It is now time to take back our streets. I am proclaiming my own act of war. I encourage all racialists and esp. all C.E.C.T. members to do the same. There are many targets on Canadian soil such as B'nai Brith offices, Mossad temples and as far as I am concerned any Jew\/Arab temple, building, house and even cars. There are no innocent Jews especially in a time of war. I ask that you mourn the loss of many of our kin that perished in NY and Washington and I want you to channel that anger and use it to fight our enemies.\nThe world as we know it has changed, from this day on everything as we know it will be different. Many more whites will die fighting the Muslims and Jews. Perhaps this will be the final war? I don't know. What I do know is we must never let this happen to us again. We need to call upon our governments and stop all immigration into North America. We need to deport all Jews, Muslims, Arabs or any other known terrorist group or religion. By allowing them to live in our country and seek refuge we are allowing them to use our own resources i.e. (welfare or public records etc.) against us. These are our streets, this is our land and the time to Fight is NOW. This is in fact our RAHOWA! United we will win.\nWPCanada\nOnward to victory!\n(emphasis added) [sic throughout]\n[37] Several pages later in this issue of the newsletter, a press release from B'nai Brith Canada dated September 11, 2001, was reproduced. The press release condemned the 9\/11 attacks, as well as the subsequent dancing in the streets of the West Bank by Palestinians that had reportedly taken place. The following editorial comment was added underneath the reproduction of the press release:\nObviously the Jews are trying to pass the buck and direct attention elsewhere. Well Fuck them all. We know who is responsible and they WILL pay on behalf of our American Brothers. I urge all Canadians who care at all to take action against B'nai Brith and all other Jew organizations. Certain cocktails are very cheap. DEATH TO ZOG!\nMr. Warman testified that ZOG stands for Zionist Occupational Government. A few paragraphs down, the newsletter states, SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Jews are hazardous to other Species.\n[38] Newsletter no. 6, dated September 21, 2001, continued on the same theme of the 9\/11 attacks. On the first page is an article that is presented under the heading Editor's Voice. The author is apparently WPCanada, whose name is printed at the end of the article. The author puts forth how he would have written President George W. Bush's speech to the U.S. Congress following the attacks:\n[...] To the people responsible for the US tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight? Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know whom you are fucking with? [...]\nHave you forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We slapped them all over the Pacific and roasted 2 million of them in their own back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen Texas on a map? Ever wonder why it is so big? Because we wanted it that way. Mexico started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns.\n(emphasis added)\n[39] Issue no. 7 of the Vinland Voice is dated September 28, 2001. The newsletter begins with four short sentences:\nJews are responsible for the immigration policies that let Arab bombers into the country. Jews are responsible for the foreign policies that made Arabs want to attack us. Jews are responsible for obscuring these facts in their media. End ZOG, end terrorism.\nThis passage is followed by a sentence modelled on the American pledge of allegiance:\nI pledge allegiance to the race-mixing rag, of the Jew-nited States of America, and to the New World Order for which it stands; one conglomerate, under Zionism, with Tyranny and Oppression for all.\n[40] Newsletter no. 12, dated December 10, 2001, contains an Editor's Voice column criticizing Israel's policies in the Middle East. But in addressing the question, the editor refers to Jews as Conspirators of Rome and Betrayers of Christ. He goes on to write that he supports the suicide attacks against the Israeli people, and suggests that maybe England would like to allocate a piece of its own land to house the Zionist plague. He adds that he, for one, would put them in warm waters, somewhere in the tropical Pacific.\n[41] In the same issue of the newsletter, the editor writes that he is sending a big hello to Mr. Warman for having filed a human rights complaint against the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. The editor identifies himself at the end of these comments as Totenkopf. The reference is apparently to an initial complaint that Mr. Warman filed with the Commission in 2001, in advance of the present complaint, which came in February 2002. The article in the newsletter contains Mr. Warman's home address. It further states that we extend our thanks to that Jewish lawyer and we give [Mr. Warman] 300,000 real reasons - and 5.7 million made-up ones - to support the [Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team]! It will be a gas!. The message ends with a final note addressed directly to Mr. Warman:\nRichard, we added you to our Christmas Card list this year. Who knows, we might even send you compensation in the amount of vacation pay your family didn't get while working at Auschwitz.\nC. Question 3 - Is the material likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? [42] In order to address this question, the meanings of the words expose, hatred and contempt must be considered. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, as well as the Federal and Supreme Courts of Canada, have had occasion to consider the sense of these terms in previous decisions. The Tribunal in Schnell, supra at paras. 85-89, provided the following synopsis of their findings:\nIn the first case dealing with s. 13(1) of the Act, Taylor and the Western Guard Party v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Attorney General of Canada (1979), T.D. 1\/79, the Human Rights Tribunal referred to the Oxford Dictionary as a source, defining hatred as:\nactive dislike, detestation, enmity, ill will, malevolence.\nand contempt as:\nthe condition of being condemned or despised; dishonour or disgrace.\nExpose is a more passive word as opposed to incite and indicates that an active effort or intent on the part of the communicator or a violent reaction by the recipient is not envisaged. Rather, expose means to leave a person unprotected; to lay open to ridicule, censure or danger; creating the right conditions for hatred or contempt to flourish leaving the identifiable group open or vulnerable to ill feelings or hostility or putting them at risk to be hated.\nThe Human Rights Tribunal in Nealy v. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, when dealing with a complaint under s. 13(1) of the Act accepted these definitions and elaborated somewhat on hatred and contempt. In the Tribunal's view, hatred involves feelings of extreme ill will towards another person or group of persons. To say that one hates another means that one finds no redeeming qualities in the latter. Contempt suggests looking down upon or treating as inferior the object of one's feelings. This reflects the dictionary definition of despise, dishonour or disgrace. But, hatred is not co-extensive with contempt. Hatred in some instances may be the result of envy of superior qualities such as intelligence, wealth and power, which contempt, by definition, cannot be.\nThe Nealy Tribunal also went on to say that the use of the word 'likely' in s. 13(1) means that it is not necessary to prove that the effect will be that those who hear the messages will direct hatred or contempt against others. Nor is it necessary to show that, in fact, anyone was so victimized.\nTaylor was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892, the main issue being the constitutionality of s. 13(1) of the Act relative to the s. 2(b) of the Charter. The Supreme Court, in concluding that s. 13(1) did not contravene the Charter, endorsed the Taylor and Nealy definitions of hatred and contempt. The Court concluded that s. 13(1) refers to unusually strong and deep-felt emotions of detestation, calumny and vilification.\n(i) The tri-cityskins.com material [43] I find that the material found on the tri-cityskins.com website is likely to expose persons who are non-Christian or non-Caucasian, to hatred or contempt. Black persons and people of the Jewish faith are particularly laid open to ridicule, ill feelings, or hostility, creating the right conditions for hatred or contempt against them to flourish.\n[44] The supposed humour found in the Jokes and the ...Of the Month pages unquestionably exposes these groups to hatred and contempt. The use of the term nigger in these jokes, with its inherent connotation of slavery, segregation, and racism, in and of itself displays hatred and contempt in regard to black people. Remarks portraying Blacks as rapists, slaves, and food for vicious dogs denote feelings of extreme ill will against them. These jokes blatantly treat black persons with disdain and as being inferior. The humour demeans the suffering of Blacks and suggests that they have no redeeming qualities.\n[45] The riddles that make cruel light of the genocide of Jews in Nazi concentration camps are similarly demeaning and disdainful. Other racial, religious, or ethnic groups (Aboriginal people, Latin Americans, South Asians, Muslims) are not spared the disparagement either. These statements all serve to dehumanize persons belonging to these various groups.\n[46] I should note that I have only excerpted but a handful of the jokes found on this website. The remainder all follow the same themes, replete with hatred and contempt directed at the groups identified.\n[47] The extreme ill will and malevolence towards black persons pervades other parts of the tri-cityskins.com website as well. The Pierce articles encourage white South Africans to get rid of all Blacks and other non-Whites, and to force them out, sterilize them or kill them. His articles urge those whom he is addressing to be prepared to kill, annihilate, any and all competitors. Such statements (exhorting the death, sterilization, or expulsion of non-Caucasians) denote extreme ill will and hatred against non-Caucasians, and suggest that the victims of this violence lack any redeeming qualities, thereby dehumanizing them.\n[48] Mr. Pierce's attempts at portraying Jewish persons as enemies of the state, working behind the scenes, and controlling media, serve to develop and encourage envy, mistrust or resentment of them, which in turn breeds hatred against them. These hateful messages are combined with signs of contempt: [Dershowitz]'s not even a fellow human being. [He] is a Jew and that says it all. Mr. Pierce reinforces his contempt directed towards Jewish persons and further exhorts hatred against them, by asserting that Dershowitz and his tribe advocate widespread torture of all non-Jews who resist Jewish supremacy.\n[49] The website manages to encourage the visitor to feel contempt against these groups even through its links to other websites. It invites visitors to travel, with one click of a mouse button, to the site of the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. Taking into account the opinions expressed in the Pierce articles, it is quite easy to draw the connection between this group's name and a call for the forceful exclusion from Canadian society of non-Caucasians. Another of the linked websites is named whitesonly.net, which has a logo that unabashedly harks back to the lynching of black persons.\n[50] I find, therefore, that the tri-cityskins.com website contains messages that are likely to expose persons who are non-Christian (namely of the Jewish and Muslim faiths) or non-Caucasian, to hatred and contempt on the basis of their race, colour, religion, or national\/ethnic origin.\n(ii) The wpcect.com material [51] I have reached the same conclusion with respect to the messages found on the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's website, wpcect.com, including the Vinland Voice newsletters.\n[52] Mr. Kulbashian contends that the Vinland Voice material should not be considered to form part of the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's website since it was found on a separate website, vinlandvoice.com. I do not agree. It is of no consequence that the material happens to be on a website the name of which does not incorporate the CECT abbreviation. The fact is that when clicking on the newsletter icon on the web pages of wpcect.com, visitors are brought directly to the Vinland Voice page. Once there, they are plainly told that they have arrived at a site that is run by the CECT. The second paragraph on many of the newsletters invites visitors to check out our CECT flyers, and to visit the CECT store. On the final page of every issue, the link to wpcect.com is prominently displayed. I am satisfied that the material found on vinlandvoice.com is an integral part of wpcect.com's Internet material.\n[53] The Intro to Racial Woes article on wpcect.com's Thoughts page is littered with statements of extreme ill will to various ethnic, racial, and religious groups. Blacks and Asians are accused of polluting our cities with gangs and drugs and sleeping with our women. East Indians are treated as filthy and undesirables. Jews are again portrayed as enemies of society who control everything that we see and hear and who head up the war against us, meaning the white race. In this manner, the article has the effect of inspiring fear and extreme resentment against these groups, which is likely to expose them to hatred and contempt.\n[54] The same themes wind their way through the newsletters. The account, in Issue No. 3, by an unnamed individual, of his exploits involving a black person who confronted him at a bar, is laden with epithets, such as dumb monkey ass looking nigger, stupid, and sewage, that are indicative of extreme contempt for black persons.\n[55] The Editor's Voice column of September 14, 2001, however, did not limit the target of its hate-ridden attacks to Blacks. Just about every non-Caucasian, and non-Christian group fell victim. Dirty Jews and Muslims are blamed for the death, on September 11, 2001, of thousands of white folk, which is likely to inspire hatred against these groups. The article then goes on to irresponsibly call on racialists and Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team members to engage in violent acts against not only buildings and institutions of the Jewish and Arab communities in Canada, but individuals as well, since there are no innocent Jews. These comments unquestionably expose the members of these groups to hatred, contempt and real physical danger, by suggesting that all manifestations of the Jewish and Arab communities are legitimate targets of indiscriminate retributory violence. The comments also convey a message that these groups lack any redeeming qualities. The author further exposes Jews, Muslims and Arabs to contempt by equating them with the terrorists responsible for the 9\/11 attacks. His call for the deportation of these groups implies that they lack redeeming qualities and are unfit to live in our country.\n[56] The incitation to violence was not restricted to the Editor's Voice column. Later in the same issue, an editorial comment is included that obviously encourages attacks by Molotov cocktail against Jewish organizations. The Jewish community in Canada is again laid open to danger by these hateful comments, which are compounded later in the same newsletter by the snide remark that Jews are hazardous to other Species, a dehumanizing and contemptuous statement that inspires hatred against them.\n[57] The September 21, 2001, issue opted to mock the religious headdress of Muslims, to trivialize the death of millions of Japanese during the Second World War, and to exacerbate this insult by adding a malevolent racial epithet (yellow bastards). These disrespectful remarks serve to dehumanize these groups and thereby expose them to contempt.\n[58] The next issue of the newsletter (September 28, 2001) continued to pursue the theme of blaming the recent terrorist acts on the alleged Jewish control over the U.S., which the newsletter described as the Jew-nited States of America. These comments again serve to expose persons of the Jewish faith to contempt and hatred by seeking to channel against them the horror and fear felt by many in the wake of 9\/11.\n[59] Mr. Kulbashian argued that these and other similar remarks made in the Vinland Voice, constituted political discourse and were not intended to expose any designated groups to hatred or contempt. Intent to discriminate, however, is not a pre-condition to a finding of discrimination (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at 549-50; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892 at 931-34). Moreover, the language of s. 13 is clear, in that it is the effect of messages that has attracted the attention of Parliament. The question to be asked is not whether the conveyor of the message intended to communicate hate or contempt, but whether the message itself is likely to expose persons belonging to the identifiable groups to hatred or contempt. If indeed the newsletter's content was intended to express a supposed political opinion, the message could have been communicated without resort to the extremist and denigrating language that pervades the various editions of the newsletter that were entered into evidence (see Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Liberty Net, [1992] 3 F.C. 155 at para. 57 (F.C.T.D.)).\n[60] The same can be said of the Vinland Voice editor's criticism of Israel's policies set out in Newsletter no. 12. The writer resorts to denigrating language against Jewish people, describing them as a Zionist plague. This characterization, along with their depiction as Betrayers of Christ, could likely incite Christians and others to feel hatred and contempt against Jews. This inference can easily be drawn when considering the context of this article. It was preceded in the same newsletter by a rant against Mr. Warman in which victims of the Holocaust were cruelly mocked:\nVacation pay... for working at Auschwitz; It will be a gas - which I take as a reference to the gas chambers used in Nazi death camps; 300,000 real reasons and 5.7 million made-up ones - which is meant to suggest that the Holocaust did not take place, or that the death toll was grossly exaggerated.\nIn my view, these remarks have the effect of exposing Jewish persons to sentiments of disdain and contempt.\n[61] For all of the foregoing reasons, I find that the messages found on the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's websites, wpcect.com and vinlandvoice.com, are likely to expose non-Christians and non-Caucasians, to hatred and contempt on the basis of their colour, religion, or national\/ethnic origin. From now on, in this decision, I will use the term Hate Messages to refer to this material, as well as those messages found on the tri-cityskins.com website that I addressed earlier.\n[62] According to s. 13(1) of the Act, the communication of hate messages must occur repeatedly to constitute a discriminatory practice. I note that in the present case, Mr. Warman and Mr. Wilson had no difficulty surfing their way to the websites in question, and receiving successive instalments of the Hate Messages on their computers on an ongoing basis over a period of several months. In my view, since the Hate Messages could be viewed at any time by anyone using the Internet, they were indeed being communicated repeatedly.\n(iii) The evidence of Dr. Frances Henry [63] The Commission had Dr. Frances Henry testify at the hearing as an expert in racism and hate propaganda. In my view, her report and testimony consisted essentially of her opinion about the ultimate question before the Tribunal. She did not provide the Tribunal with any significant insight into the stereotypical or racial aspects of the Hate Messages and how these aspects could expose persons to hatred or contempt, certainly no more so than the Tribunal can assess for itself or can garner from the body of jurisprudence relating to s. 13 of the Act. Moreover, in the course of her cross-examination, she acknowledged that her studies were in the areas of racism and how it manifests itself, not specifically in the realm of hate propaganda at issue in the present case.\n[64] Dr. Henry's evidence has therefore had no bearing on my final disposition of this case.\nD. Question 4 - Did Mr. Kulbashian or Mr. Richardson, alone or in concert with each other or others, repeatedly communicate the Hate Messages, or cause them to be so communicated? (i) Evidence gathered by Mr. Warman [65] Mr. Warman and the Commission claim that Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson were involved in various ways in the communication of the Hate Messages via the Internet. This allegation is based on evidence gathered by Mr. Warman, as well as the London Police Service. He submits that in order to avoid being identified, Mr. Kulbashian used the pseudonyms Alex Krause and Totenkopf in his activities, and that Mr. Richardson went by the names James Scott and WPCanada (an abbreviation for White Power Canada).\n[66] In the course of his monitoring of the websites on which the Hate Messages had been found, Mr. Warman sought to learn the identity of the person or persons who operated them. The websites were identified by domain names (ie. tri-cityskins.com, wpcect.com, vinlandvoice.com). Domain names must be registered with a domain name registration service. According to Mr. Warman, one of the largest such operations is run by an organization known as register.com. This firm also offers an on-line service, called a Who-is search, that enables someone to submit the domain name of a website and generate the names of its contact persons. Mr. Warman conducted such a search in October 2001, which yielded the following results:\nTri-cityskins.com:\nThe record regarding its domain name was created on March 6, 2001. The Registrant was listed as Tri-City Skinheads, with the declared address being 14 Eighty-Eighth Avenue, Kitchener, Ontario 5M4RTIES. The name given for the website's Technical Contact person was Skinheads, Tri-City. Mr. Warman believes that this information is clearly fictional. The street name is a reference to the number 88, which, as mentioned earlier, allegedly signifies Heil Hitler. The postal code mimics the word smarties. The name provided as the website's Administrative Contact is Public\/Press Relations - CECT, Totenkopf. Mr. Warman testified that Totenkopf means death head in German, and is symbolized by a skull and cross-bones. This was the logo used by the Nazi SS-Panzer divisions in World War II. The Administrative Contact's address is listed as P.O. Box 1061, 31 Adelaide Street East, Toronto, Ontario. The website's domain server is identified as Affordable-Space.com.\nWpcect.com:\nThe record regarding this website's domain name was created on February 7, 2001, and had just been updated on October 3, 2001, when Mr. Warman conducted his Who-is search. The Registrant is shown as C.E.C.T., and its declared address is P.O. Box 1061, 31 Adelaide Street East, Toronto, which is identical to the above noted address of tri-cityskins.com's administrative contact, Totenkopf. The Administrative, Technical, and Billing Contacts for Wpcect.com are listed as being the same person: WPCANADA, Totenkopf, with the same P.O. Box address mentioned above. The website's domain server is also identified as Affordable-Space.com.\n[67] Mr. Warman filed in evidence a printout of a page from the wpcect.com website, which declares that the C.E.C.T. finally has a P.O. Box. This statement is signed Totenkopf, and the postal box address is identical to that found on the Who-is searches referred to above. In the Contact Information section of the wpcect.com website, there is a table indicating that for public\/press relations, organization information, or to submit tips that could help us out in our mission, one should send an e-mail message to Totenkopf@wpcect.com. For internal affairs and joining if you are not already a member of a Pro-White organization, e-mails should be addressed to WPCanada@wpcect.com. The Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's post office box information is also reprinted on this page.\n[68] Mr. Warman testified that he conducted a Who-is search with respect to Affordable Space.com's website as well. The administrative contact's address was the same as for tri-cityskins.com and wpcect.com: P.O. Box 1061, 31 Adelaide Street East, Toronto.\n[69] Mr. Warman's research also led him to a website of a student-run film festival that had taken place in May 2001. The organizers of the festival gave special thanks on their website to the server hosting the site, Alexan Kulbashian. Mr. Warman then conducted a Who-is search of the festival's website, which revealed that the site's domain server was affordable-space.com.\n[70] Mr. Warman testified that to his knowledge, domain servers are used at an intermediary level. They enable the websites of domain name registrants to be accessible to the public via the Internet. Mr. Warman did not seem entirely confident in this explanation, and aside from his basic familiarity with the Internet as a frequent user, he did not profess to be an expert in the area, nor did he testify as such. However, the Respondents did not lead any evidence to contradict Mr. Warman. Moreover, it is obvious from Mr. Warman's documents that a domain server has a significant role to play in the operation of a website, so much so that the identification of the domain server warrants mention on the Who-is registry. It is noteworthy that in the case of both tri-cityskins.com and wpcect.com, Affordable Space.com was their domain server.\n[71] Mr. Warman's research also led him to enter the name Alexan Kulbashian into the Google Internet search engine, which scanned the Internet for any site containing these key words. The search results included a site where a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of a person named Alexan Kulbashian had been posted. The details appearing on this r\u00e9sum\u00e9 are consistent with other personal details about the respondent, Mr. Kulbashian, that are in evidence. I am satisfied that this is his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n[72] Mr. Warman's search was conducted in December 2002, but the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 itself bears no date. It details, under the heading experience, Mr. Kulbashian's involvement, from 1999 onwards, with Affordable Space.com, which is described as a website hosting, design, and technical support firm. The r\u00e9sum\u00e9 explains that Affordable Space.com started off as a private project and then turned into a business, hosting over a thousand accounts, and that at the moment I am working on a 24\/7 technical support availability for the company.\n[73] On the basis of all the information he has collected and put together, Mr. Warman is of the belief that Mr. Kulbashian was involved in the provision of web server hosting services, through an enterprise known as Affordable Space.com, and that wpcect.com as well as tri-cityskins.com were among the websites hosted by Mr. Kulbashian. Mr. Warman submits that these elements are sufficient to establish the connection between Mr. Kulbashian and the Hate Messages.\n(ii) Evidence gathered by the London Police Service [74] The Commission relies on evidence collected during a criminal investigation to further establish the link between Mr. Kulbashian and the Hate Messages. This evidence, it is argued, also establishes the connection to Mr. Richardson. The Commission called Terry Wilson, who worked as a police detective with the police service of London, Ontario, during the same period that Mr. Warman had viewed the Hate Messages on the Internet. Mr. Wilson worked within the hate crime unit, and his investigations included monitoring Internet websites and Internet relay chat lines (also known as instant messaging), where people communicate directly on-line to each other via the Internet. He was aware that some of the websites he was monitoring belonged to organizations that were based in the London-Kitchener-Waterloo area.\n[75] Mr. Wilson adopted a pseudonym and began participating in some of the chat lines he was monitoring. One of the participants on the chat line being run through the tri-cityskins.com website used the name coxswain24wpcanada. Mr. Wilson initiated a conversation by e-mail with this person, who informed him that he was located in London, Ontario, and that he belonged to an organization, the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, that had several members in London. Mr. Wilson wrote that he wanted to join too. On August 22, 2001, Mr. Wilson received an e-mail in response, informing him that there would be a meeting that evening. The sender of the e-mail gave him his telephone number in London and signed the message James.\n[76] In verifying the location for the telephone number, Mr. Wilson noticed that the address corresponded to that of an apartment complex where a building superintendent had previously filed a complaint with the police, alleging that someone had defaced the building's hallways and elevators with stickers bearing racist messages. Mr. Wilson met with the building superintendent who produced the lease for the premises where the telephone number had been assigned. There were two co-tenants indicated: James S. Richardson and a woman, whose identity need not be revealed in this decision. The building superintendent said they had been residing there since November 2000.\n[77] Sometime after initiating his e-mail communications with the person named James, Mr. Wilson's e-mail address somehow got on the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's mailing list, which began sending him the Vinland Voice newsletter by e-mail. When Mr. Wilson viewed the September 14, 2001, issue of the newsletter, (which I have already determined contains some of the Hate Messages in this case), he opened a separate criminal investigation on what he perceived as death threats found therein.\n[78] Mr. Wilson obtained a search warrant for the apartment in question, and executed it on September 28, 2001. Mr. Richardson was found in the apartment when the police entered and was arrested. He was charged with uttering threats against property and persons, and counselling the indictable offences of murder and of property damage.\n[79] Mr. Wilson testified about having found a large flag with a Nazi swastika insignia in the premises. There was also a bomber jacket with a patch labelled Tri-City Skins on one side. On the other side of the jacket, there was a patch with the half-Celtic cross\/half maple leaf logo that was associated with the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, as had been displayed on wpcect.com. Mr. Wilson also found perforated sheets that are used to print business cards with a computer's printer. The cards had already been printed. Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team! In partnership with the National Skinhead Front was inscribed in the centre of each card. In the lower corner appeared the name WPCanada, followed by Recruiting Director. The cards had yet to be separated along their perforations, suggesting perhaps that they had been printed on the premises.\n[80] A police crime analyst specializing in electronic evidence was involved in the search operation. He seized a computer found in the apartment, and once back at the police station, made a mirror image of its hard drive and examined its content. Amongst the directories on the drive was one that contained the logs of Internet relay chats in which the user of the computer had participated. These logs were organized into folders that were identified by the name of the participant who had initiated a particular chat session. The logs are set out in a manner similar to the script of a play. When participants chat, their name appears first, followed by the statement that they have typed in. Every participant's comments can be viewed by all the persons taking part in the chat discussion.\n[81] One of the logs found on the seized computer was called #wpcanada. Amongst the participants in the discussion on this log is someone going by the name of WPCanada. During one session that took place at 2:00 AM on September 4, 2001, WPCanada says that he is signing out and going to sleep. One of the other participants, called DeadGrl, replies by stating that she waves at James and says buh bye. In another session, the name of Sheila Copps, who is a former Member of Parliament from Hamilton, comes up. WPCanada then adds that she is from my town. Mr. Wilson testified having viewed Mr. Richardson's driver's licence at the time of the arrest. The address shown on the licence was in Hamilton. The documents regarding Mr. Richardson's release following the arrest show that he was required to reside at the same Hamilton address as indicated on his driver's licence.\n[82] During another chat session, the log shows WPCanada typing in the word away, which is used on chat discussions to indicate that a person has stepped out of a session. About one hour later, someone using the name Totenkopf joins the session and writes, Hey James, wake up. No one responds, so Totenkopf then types in Okay... then go to sleep. In a subsequent exchange, a participant called TankTCS informs WPCanada that he has a Nazi shirt for you James. WPCanada responds, Ok. The same conversation continues at a later point. TankTCS asks, James, what ones [shirts] do you want? WPCanada responds, I want both black.\n[83] On September 13, 2001, TankTCS enters the session by writing, James...how are you? WPCanada responds by typing that he is fighting with his woman, and refers to the same first name as that of the woman who was the co-tenant of the London apartment where Mr. Richardson was arrested. WPCanada then goes on to write that he was just finishing off the Voice, adding that it's a biggie. The Commission points out that the Vinland Voice article that led to Mr. Richardson's arrest appeared on the Internet the following day, September 14, 2001. That Editor's Voice article was signed WPCanada.\n[84] There are several other entries on the chat logs where WPCanada is referred to by the other participants as James.\n[85] In another session, WPCanada converses with someone who is using the name Bones2001, regarding the wpcect.com newsletter. WPCanada tells him that he should write an article for us, and suggests that if he wants to receive the newsletter by e-mail, he should send a message to cect@wpcect.com, and I will hook you up.\n[86] One of the other chat logs is labelled Ihatejews. The Commission filed an excerpt from a session that took place around 1:30 AM, on September 14, 2001. A participant in this session explains that he had just read the CECT newsletter that you had put out a couple of days earlier and had really appreciated it. WPCanada responds to this comment by saying, Wait until you see tomorrows [sic] [...] a CECT declaration of war against the B'nai Brith, Jews, Muslims. Mr. Warman points out that this reflects the actual content of the Vinland Voice article that was posted on September 14, 2001. As this relay chat was effectively being conducted the night before the publication of the newsletter, Mr. Warman believes that WPCanada's advance knowledge of its content demonstrates that he must have been its author.\n[87] Interestingly, amongst the various files found on the computer that was seized in the London apartment was a word processing file entitled vv5. A copy of the file was produced at the hearing. It consists of the entire text of the September 14, 2001, issue of the Vinland Voice (Newsletter #5) that Mr. Warman and Mr. Wilson had received by e-mail and had viewed on the Vinland Voice website. The computer's records showed that this file had been last modified on September 14, 2001, at 3:45 AM. This supports the inference that Mr. Richardson had been in possession of this edition of the newsletter prior to its distribution, and that he was directly involved in its subsequent communication via the Internet.\n[88] The various chat logs record numerous entries by WPCanada that clearly indicate his active involvement with the production of the Vinland Voice newsletter:\nWe have a weekly newsletter called the Vinland Voice; I was finishing the Vinland Voice off; [...]finishing the webpage for the Vinland Voice, a weekly white newspaper that I do; I was just finishing off the homepage for the Vinland Voice.\n[89] In reviewing the logs, Mr. Wilson noticed that when persons would join an Internet relay chat, a code was recorded on the log, which contained the name of their Internet service provider (ISP) through which these persons were able to access the Internet. WPCanada's ISP was a firm named Execulink. Mr. Wilson obtained a warrant and seized Execulink's records as they pertained to these relay chat exchanges. When WPCanada joined a chat session on the evening of September 13, 2001, a code from Execulink was recorded on the #wpcanada chat log. Execulink confirmed to Mr. Wilson that this code related to an Internet Protocol address that had been assigned to one of its clients whose user name was Cox88. Their records further showed that the actual name of this client was James Richardson. The contact information that he had provided to Execulink showed his street address as being that of the apartment in London where Mr. Wilson had found and arrested the respondent, Mr. Richardson, on September 28, 2001.\n[90] Taking all of these circumstances into account, on the balance of probabilities, I am persuaded that the person using the pseudonym WPCanada was in fact the respondent, James Richardson, and that Mr. Richardson was actively involved in the editing and production of the Vinland Voice newsletter. I am also satisfied that, prior to his arrest, Mr. Richardson was the individual behind the articles, editorial comments, and other messages that were placed on the Vinland Voice's website under his pseudonym, WPCanada, or generally as the newsletter's editor. In particular, I am convinced that Mr. Richardson, as editor of the Vinland Voice, posted on the website the account of the Tri-City Skins party that took place in Kitchener. I am also convinced that he wrote the September 14, 2001 article relating to U.S. terrorist attacks, the call for the use of certain cocktails against Jewish organizations, and the Surgeon-General's warning about Jews.\n[91] Interestingly, in the first issue of the Vinland Voice following Mr. Richardson's arrest (dated October 6, 2001), WPCanada no longer appears as the editor of the Vinland Voice. In this edition and the several other editions from December 2001 to January 2002 that were introduced in evidence, the editor's articles are signed Totenkopf, or on occasion Alex Krause. As I explain below, I am convinced that these were in fact pseudonyms used by Mr. Kulbashian. In my view, the change in putative authorship that occurred after Mr. Richardson's arrest on September 28, 2001, further establishes that he was involved in the production of the newsletter until that point.\n(iii) Link between Mr. Richardson and Mr. Kulbashian [92] During the course of Mr. Richardson's arrest in the London apartment, he asked to speak to his lawyer by telephone. His hands were already handcuffed but he told Mr. Wilson that the lawyer's number was stored on the speed-dial memory of the phone. Mr. Wilson pressed the indicated button on the phone and put the handset up to Mr. Richardson's ear. As soon as the party at the other end answered, Mr. Richardson shouted into the handset, Get rid of all the shit! Mr. Wilson, realizing that Mr. Richardson had misled him into calling someone other than his lawyer, immediately hung up the phone. Some time later, the phone rang. Mr. Wilson answered. The caller asked Mr. Wilson who he was, and then, after using some foul language, the caller hung up.\n[93] Mr. Wilson testified that when he returned to his office later that day, he received a call from someone who identified himself as Alex Krause. The caller said that it was he who had telephoned to the London apartment earlier. He stated that he was a member of the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team and the Tri-City Skins, and insisted that the criminal case against Mr. Richardson was groundless.\n[94] Mr. Richardson's arrest became a principal topic in the October 6, 2001, issue of the Vinland Voice newsletter. In the Editor's Voice column, the indicated author of which is Totenkopf, Mr. Wilson's telephone number was printed and every supporter was urged to call him and express disgust at Mr. Richardson's arrest. An additional remark in the column was addressed personally to Mr. Wilson and made reference to his family.\n[95] In the apparent belief that the person whom Mr. Richardson had telephoned during his arrest had something to do with the column in question, a colleague of Mr. Wilson's from the London Police Service called the same phone number to complain about the column. Someone named Alex answered, and undertook, after some discussions with the police officer, to remove the article from the newsletter. Mr. Wilson testified that later the same day, the portion of the column relating to him was indeed deleted from the newsletter.\n[96] Upon further investigation, Mr. Wilson learned that the phone number Mr. Richardson had called during the arrest was listed in Mr. Kulbashian's name, with an address in the North York area of Toronto. Research into Mr. Kulbashian's past led to information that he had once been arrested on a racially-motivated assault charge. Mr. Wilson contacted Toronto police and acquired his identification photo from the arrest. It showed that at that time, Mr. Kulbashian wore on his arm a tattoo of a swastika encircled with the words White Power, as well as a tattoo of a skull and crossbones, which Mr. Wilson recognized as a Nazi-era totenkopf or death head.\n[97] Mr. Wilson's investigation eventually led him to conclude that Totenkopf and Alex Krause were pseudonyms for Mr. Kulbashian, and that he had also been involved in the publication of the September 14, 2001, Vinland Voice articles. Mr. Wilson therefore sought and obtained warrants for the arrest of Mr. Kulbashian (on charges similar to those filed against Mr. Richardson) and for the search of his residence at his parents' home in North York. The warrants were executed on January 30, 2002. During the search, t-shirts with logos referring to the Skinhead movement were found in his room, along with several individual business cards. One of the cards was marked CECT, Totenkopf, Public\/Press Relations. A notepad was also seized bearing numerous doodles of swastikas, nooses with the words hang them high, as well as Heil Hitler, niggers, and Aryan Power. Mr. Kulbashian's first name Alexan had also been written, but with the X stylized in a form that looked like a slightly misshapen swastika.\n[98] Mr. Kulbashian was transported to London Police Service headquarters, where he was interviewed by Mr. Wilson. The interview was recorded on videotape, and a transcript of the interview was later prepared by the secretarial staff of the London Police Service's Crime Division. Excerpts of the transcript were entered into evidence at the hearing. Mr. Wilson testified that it accurately reflects the statements recorded on the videotape. There was no evidence introduced to call into question the accuracy of the transcript. As I have already noted, after the Complainant and the Commission closed their cases, the respondents opted not to lead any evidence.\n[99] During the police interview, Mr. Kulbashian explained that Affordable Space.com was his server, and that he had been operating it for two years prior to the arrest. He described how he had provided space on his server to the Tri-City Skins group and others, including the National Skinhead Front, and the Canadian National Skinhead Front. These groups used the space to operate their web domains, for a fee of $10 per month. He added that since he was a member of the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, he opted to donate the space for its web domain without charging a fee. The Vinland Voice web site was also hosted on his server.\n[100] Mr. Kulbashian told Mr. Wilson that of the 80 web sites that were hosted on his server, about 20 were racialist sites. Mr. Kulbashian pointed out that he did not visit or view all of the sites that had opted to use his server, and that Affordable Space.com was not set up to only serve racialist sites. It was meant to offer web space at an affordable price. However, he also acknowledged that he would never sell space to groups affiliated with the Anti-Racist Action group. Were he to ever have learned that such an organization had registered space on his server, he would have exercised his power to remove it from the server and refunded the fee.\n[101] Interestingly, in a relay chat conversation that took place on September 6, 2001, which was recorded on the fdajews log found on the computer seized in the London apartment, a participant named fdajews asked wpcanada (Mr. Richardson) how it was that Alex was giving all these people web space, post office boxes, and so on. Mr. Richardson replied that he spends a lot of his personal dough on donating web space, adding that we are the best web hoster in our movement and that it is through donations and dedication that the service is provided.\n[102] Mr. Kulbashian told Mr. Wilson, during the police interview, that he ran his web hosting services through a server computer that was physically located in the United States. He did so in part because it was cheaper and more advantageous from a technical perspective, but also as a means to avoid the reach of the Canadian Human Rights Act. He explained that he was familiar with a decision of the Tribunal that had resulted in the closure of a Canadian server. He therefore figured that by plugging the server in the States, he would not have to follow the Canadian law on what I do with my server.\n[103] Mr. Kulbashian also explained during his police interview that he had designed the template for the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team website (wpcect.com). For this reason, his logo, which consisted of a death head skull and crossbones together with the word Totenkopf underneath, could be seen on the left side of the website's pages. As for the written material that was posted on the site and the Vinland Voice newsletter, he acknowledged that he was the author of any material signed Alex Krause, and at least a portion of what had been signed Totenkopf. All email messages sent to the address totenkopf@wpcect.com were redirected to him.\n[104] It is worth noting that on the home page of vinlandvoice.com, the website where the newsletters can be viewed, there is a message thanking Totenkopf our webmaster amongst others, for helping us out and for his continuing support.\n[105] In the end, the Crown prosecutor apparently decided to withdraw the criminal charges against Mr. Richardson and Mr. Kulbashian before going to trial. According to Mr. Wilson, the Crown concluded that there was no reasonable expectation of conviction on the charges laid against them.\n(iv) Print media articles about Mr. Richardson and Mr. Kulbashian [106] Articles from several south-western Ontario newspapers and magazines were entered into evidence. One of them was published in the September 20, 2001, edition of The Kitchener-Waterloo Record, and was written by journalist Brian Caldwell. He reported on his interview of two white supremacists named James Scott, 27, and Alex Krause, 20. By comparison, at the time of the article's publication, Mr. Richardson was 27 years old and Mr. Kulbashian was two months shy of his 20th birthday, based on their dates of birth as they appear on the exhibits relating to their arrests.\n[107] On October 3, 2001, the same journalist wrote an article in the The Record outlining the details surrounding Mr. Richardson's arrest. The reporter also gave an account of his interview with Alex Krause, of Toronto, who claimed that he and Mr. Richardson were the only formal members of the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, which they created as an information network for white supremacists around the country.\n[108] The September 20, 2001, interview with Brian Caldwell became a topic of discussion on the chat logs that were found on the computer seized in the London apartment. On the #wpcanada log, Mr. Richardson (a.k.a. WPCanada) can be seen telling another participant that Brian Caldwell had called his mother's house looking to interview him. He later writes that Alex and he did a 45 minute interview with the reporter.\n[109] In another article, published in the November 29, 2001, issue of Now Magazine, based in Toronto, someone using the name Alex Krause was interviewed. The article's headline was Skinheads on the March - Attacks in Kitchener have Anti-racists Worried. Krause was described in the story as a member who runs the server that the Tri-City Skins et al. use to run their web sites.\n[110] While I am mindful that reports by journalists of others' statements should be treated with a fair degree of circumspection, I am also aware of the Tribunal's authority under s. 50(3) to accept evidence, irrespective of whether it would be admissible in a court of law. This is a principle that would also apply, incidentally, to the admissions and declarations against interest made by Mr. Kulbashian in the police interview transcript. The connection between the information found in the media stories on the one hand, and the chat relay logs on the other, lends further support to the contention that Mr. Richardson and Mr. Kulbashian were closely involved with the websites through which the Hate Messages were communicated.\n(v) The Tribunal's findings regarding Mr. Richardson and Mr. Kulbashian [111] Taking all of the evidence into account, I have made the following findings with respect to Mr. Richardson and Mr. Kulbashian and their level of involvement with the Hate Messages:\nMr. Richardson and Mr. Kulbashian were members of the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team; Mr. Kulbashian operated a firm, under the name Affordable Space.com, which provided web hosting services for websites that included tri-cityskins.com, wpcect.com, and vinlandvoice.com; Mr. Richardson and Mr. Kulbashian contributed to the content posted on the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's website, namely its Vinland Voice newsletter, under the pseudonyms WPCanada and James Scott (Mr. Richardson), as well as Totenkopf and Alex Krause (Mr. Kulbashian); Mr. Richardson was the author of the September 14, 2001, article relating to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which is one of the communications that I have found to comprise the Hate Messages. It is evident from the chat relay logs that he drafted the text of the article and posted it on the website; Mr. Richardson, in his capacity as editor of the Vinland Voice up until his arrest on September 28, 2001, posted the editorial comments found in the newsletter that I have determined to form part of the Hate Messages in this case; Mr. Kulbashian (under the pseudonyms Totenkopf and Alex Krause) assumed the functions of editor and contributor to the Editor's Voice and other editorial comments in the Vinland Voice, following Mr. Richardson's arrest. Mr. Kulbashian, in this capacity, authored the material communicated in Newsletter #12 (December 12, 2001) that I have determined to form part of the Hate Messages in this case. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that either Mr. Richardson or Mr. Kulbashian were involved in drafting or otherwise contributing to any of the material posted on the tri-cityskins.com website. However, Mr. Kulbashian was aware that persons or groups of persons acting in concert were using his web services to communicate messages that contravened s. 13 of the Act, which included the material posted on the tri-cityskins.com website. One quarter of the websites that Mr. Kulbashian hosted on his server were, as he acknowledged, racialist in nature. Mr. Kulbashian admitted during the taped police interview that he intentionally used a server that was physically situated in the United States in a deliberate effort to avoid being subject to the Canadian Human Rights Act. According to s. 13(3) of the Act, an owner or operator of a telecommunication undertaking through which hate messages are communicated, is not in breach of the Act by reason only that its facilities were used by other persons for the transmission of the material. Mr. Kulbashian cannot benefit from this exemption. Aside from the fact that I find he was actively involved in the preparation of the content placed on the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's Internet newsletter, the evidence is that he encouraged other groups, which he himself described as racialist, to use his services. I am convinced that he knew exactly the kind of material that these organizations would have been posting on the Internet, including the portions of the Hate Messages that were found on the tri-cityskins.com website hosted by his firm, Affordable Space.com. It appears that he even allowed these websites to share Affordable Space.com's post office box. Mr. Kulbashian cannot therefore claim that the Hate Messages were communicated over his server by reason only that he happened to be its owner. On the contrary, he fostered and encouraged the use of his computer server for the communication of the Hate Messages by these groups.\n[112] I therefore find that Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson, individually and in concert, communicated or caused to be communicated repeatedly through the Internet, matter that is likely to expose persons to hatred or contempt based on their religion, race, or ethnic\/national origin. Mr. Warman's s. 13 complaint against Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson has been substantiated.\n[113] In their cross-examinations of Commission witnesses, Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson occasionally suggested that they had been wrongly accused and that in fact, other individuals had been involved in building and maintaining these websites. Neither of them, however, opted to lead any evidence to support these suggestions.\n[114] The ultimate burden obviously rests on the complainant and the Commission to establish their case, on a balance of probabilities. But where the prima facie case has been made out, it is incumbent upon a respondent to provide a reasonable explanation demonstrating that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory.\n[115] From my earlier discussion on the evidence, it is clear that a prima facie case has been established against Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson. Did they put forth a reasonable explanation? Both gentlemen indicated at the outset of the hearing that they looked forward to presenting their versions of the facts when their turn would come up. But when this opportunity finally arrived, they chose not to adduce any evidence. The Tribunal cannot take stock of mere hints or innuendos that may have been tossed in with their leading questions during their cross-examination of Commission witnesses, if there is ultimately no evidence introduced to sustain these assertions. This is not a reasonable explanation.\nE. Question 5 - Has the complaint been substantiated against the other named respondents (Affordable Space.com, Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (CECT) and Tri-City Skins.com)? (i) Affordable Space.com [116] I have already determined that Mr. Kulbashian operated a firm under the name Affordable Space.com, which provided web hosting services for websites that included tri-cityskins.com, wpcect.com, and vinlandvoice.com. It is not clear from the evidence whether Mr. Kulbashian operated this business as a sole proprietorship, a corporation, or in some other manner, but there was some indication that after his arrest, Mr. Kulbashian transferred Affordable Space.com's operations to a third party. Irrespective of the precise legal form of the business, however, I am prepared to find that it was a person within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act, capable of engaging in the discriminatory conduct contemplated therein.\n[117] Affordable Space.com did not formally appear at the hearing, but did it have sufficient notice of these proceedings? The evidence, which ranges from Mr. Kulbashian's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and his declaration during the police interview, to his involvement on the film festival website, makes it obvious that he was the principal - if not the sole - operator of Affordable Space.com. Mr. Kulbashian did not present any evidence to demonstrate that his role within the business was somehow different from the picture drawn by the Commission and the Complainant. Mr. Kulbashian was aware of the complaint filed against Affordable Space.com, and considering his key role in this firm, I am satisfied that Affordable Space.com had sufficient notice of these proceedings.\n[118] Given that Affordable Space.com provided the web services that enabled the Hate Messages to be disseminated over the Internet, it is my finding that Affordable Space.com caused the Hate Messages to be communicated, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act.\n[119] Furthermore, I do not believe that Affordable Space.com operated a communication undertaking that could benefit from the exception of s. 13(3). Considering Mr. Kulbashian's major role in Affordable Space.com's operations, and how he actively involved himself in and encouraged the communication of the Hate Messages over its server, Affordable Space.com cannot claim that the messages were communicated by reason only that its facilities were used by others. The complaint against Affordable Space.com has been substantiated.\n(ii) The Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team [120] I am satisfied on the evidence presented that an organization existed at the time of Mr. Warman's complaint called the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. The wpcect.com and vinlandvoice.com web pages alluded to the existence of the group. Mr. Kulbashian acknowledged during his police interview that he was involved with the group, as did Mr. Richardson in the chat relay logs.\n[121] Just as in the case of Affordable Space.com, there is no evidence before me that this group of persons has any formal legal existence. But, as the Tribunal pointed out in Nealy, supra, this changes little. A group of people accepting a common political and social agenda who see themselves as part of an institution or movement may constitute a group of persons working in concert, for the purposes of s. 13. I find this definition applicable to the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team.\n[122] Although the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team did not formally appear at the hearing, did it have sufficient notice of these proceedings? Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson were primary members of the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, as the police interview, the chat log discussions, and the business cards seized during their arrests would bear out.\n[123] As co-respondents to the complaint, Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson were of course personally aware of the complaint against the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. I am therefore satisfied that the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team was given sufficient notice of these proceedings.\n[124] A substantial portion of the Hate Messages was posted on the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's websites (wpcect.com and vinlandvoice.com). Consequently, I find that the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team engaged in a discriminatory practice by communicating or causing these messages to be communicated repeatedly over the Internet. The complaint against the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team has been substantiated.\n(iii) Tri-city Skins.com [125] I have no evidence before me to indicate that Tri-city Skins.com - or more accurately tri-cityskins.com - was anything more than a domain name of a website. It was allegedly used by the Tri-City Skins, which according to Mr. Warman and Mr. Wilson, was a group of persons based in southern Ontario. However, the Tri-City Skins group was not named as a respondent, and I have no evidence regarding its structure.\n[126] The situation with respect to tri-cityskins.com differs from that of Affordable Space.com. Despite the presence of .com in its name, the evidence is that Affordable Space.com is the name of a business operated by Mr. Kulbashian. In contrast, based on the evidence before me, tri-cityskins.com is just the name of a website.\n[127] The Commission appeared to argue in its final submissions that since the website's name is similar enough to the group's, the Tribunal should make a finding against the Tri-City Skins. I do not agree. It would be unfair and inappropriate for a Tribunal to issue decisions against groups or persons who have not been named as respondents in a complaint. A web domain was named as the respondent. Only a person or group of persons acting in concert can be found to have discriminated under s. 13. In my view, a web domain is not a person or group of persons acting in concert, within the meaning of this provision.\n[128] Even if I were to accept the Commission's proposition that the designation in the complaint of Tri-CitySkins.com enables me to make findings against the Tri-City Skins, my decision would still not change. There is no indication that the Tri-City Skins group was ever given notice of these proceedings even in the guise of Tri-City Skins.com. Pursuant to the information provided by the Commission, the Tribunal sent correspondence intended for Tri-City Skins.com, including the notices of hearing, to Mr. Richardson and Mr. Kulbashian. The notices were returned by the post office. In Mr. Richardson's case, the envelope was simply marked unclaimed. Mr. Kulbashian's envelope came back with the notation refused - return to sender. Neither one accepted service on behalf of the group or acknowledged that he was in a position to do so.\n[129] Mr. Richardson admitted to being a member of the Tri-City Skins during his final arguments at the hearing, but I have no evidence of any further involvement, particularly regarding the tri-cityskins.com website. The only evidence linking Mr. Kulbashian to the group is a newspaper report and Mr. Wilson's recollection in his testimony of a comment made by Mr. Kulbashian during an initial telephone conversation, prior to his arrest. While it is true that Tri-Cityskins.com's postal address was the same as that of Mr. Kulbashian's firm, Affordable Space.com, the evidence from the chat log discussions and the police interview indicate that Mr. Kulbashian was allowing his other racialist clients to use his post office box as well.\n[130] I do not find this evidence sufficient to establish a link between Mr. Kulbashian and the Tri-City Skins group, other than as a simple member like Mr. Richardson, at most. In these circumstances, I do not think that notification of mere members of a group can be construed as official notice to the group. Thus, while Mr. Richardson's and Mr. Kulbashian's presence at the pre-hearing case management conferences and at the hearings themselves makes it clear that they acquired sufficient notice of the proceedings against them personally, I cannot subsume this knowledge with that of the Tri-City Skins.\n[131] For me to accept the Commission's proposition, it would mean that the Tri-City Skins would be designated as a party to the complaint at the final stages of the inquiry, after all of the evidence has been adduced. This would be unfair and a breach of natural justice.\n[132] For all these reasons, the complaint against the respondent, Tri-city Skins.com is not substantiated.\nIV. REMEDIES [133] The Commission and Mr. Warman request that the Tribunal issue several orders pursuant to s. 54 (1) of the Act.\nA. An order that the discriminatory practice cease (s. 54(1)(a)) [134] Section 54(1)(a) empowers the Tribunal to order a respondent to cease the discriminatory practice, and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or prevent it from occurring in the future.\n[135] Accordingly, I order Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson, as well as Affordable Space.com and the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, to cease and desist from communicating or causing to be communicated, by the means described in s. 13 of the Act, namely the Internet, any matter of the type contained in the Hate Messages that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that the person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nB. An order for special compensation (s. 54(1)(b)) [136] Section 54(1)(b) provides that where a victim is specifically identified in the communication that constituted the discriminatory practice, the Tribunal may order the payment of special compensation to the victim, of a sum that is not to exceed $20,000, if the Tribunal determines that the respondent engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. The Complainant is seeking this special compensation in the amount of $10,000, from Mr. Kulbashian and the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team.\n[137] The Complainant was specifically named in the Vinland Voice newsletter no. 12, of December 10, 2001. I have already determined that the author of the article in question was Mr. Kulbashian. The article posted Mr. Warman's home address and gave thanks to that Jewish lawyer. Mr. Warman is apparently not Jewish but the author obviously perceived him as such. The article went on to make cruel remarks about Holocaust victims, including those that the author assumed were Mr. Warman's relatives.\n[138] The attack was very personal and Mr. Warman testified that he felt some concern, considering the reference to the murder of Holocaust victims and the posting of his home address in the newsletter. He interpreted the allusion to the death of Jews in the past, as a direct threat to his own personal safety. In my view, and in keeping with my earlier findings regarding the Vinland Voice Newsletter no. 12, this attack was likely to expose him to hatred or contempt on the basis of being identifiable on a prohibited ground of discrimination. It does not matter whether Mr. Warman was in fact Jewish or not. A person who is perceived to have the characteristics of someone who falls within one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination, may be the object of discrimination even though he does not actually have those characteristics (School District No. 44 (North Vancouver) v. Jubran, 2005 BCCA 201 at para. 41, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused; see also Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montreal (City), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665). Taken in this context, Mr. Warman is in my view, a victim of the Hate Messages that constituted of the discriminatory practice.\n[139] These statements were unquestionably wilful attacks against Mr. Warman, but I note that this was the only instance where he was specifically identified in any of the Hate Messages. Having regard to all of the circumstances, I order Mr. Kulbashian to pay Mr. Warman the sum of $5,000 as special compensation pursuant to s. 54(1)(b) of the Act.\n[140] As for the relief sought against the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, I have already found that it was responsible for the publication of the Vinland Voice Newsletter, which contained the attack against Mr. Warman. However, in the joint Statement of Particulars filed by the Commission and the Complainant in advance of the hearing, special compensation pursuant to s. 54(1)(b) was not included in the list of remedies being sought against the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. This remedial claim was introduced for the first time during final submissions. Given the tardiness of the claim, in my view, it would be inappropriate to issue an order for special compensation against this respondent.\nC. Interest [141] Mr. Kulbashian is ordered to pay simple interest on the award of special compensation calculated on a yearly basis at the Bank Rate (monthly series) established by the Bank of Canada. The interest shall run from the date of the complaint until the date of payment.\nD. Penalty [142] The Tribunal may order a respondent who engaged in a discriminatory practice as set out in s. 13, to pay a penalty of up to $10,000, pursuant to s. 54(1)(c). Section 54(1.1) spells out several factors that the Tribunal must take into account when deciding whether to make such an order:\nThe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice; The wilfulness or intent of the respondent, any prior discriminatory practices that he has engaged in, and his ability to pay the penalty.\nThe Commission has requested that the maximum penalty be imposed against each of the respondents.\n(i) Mr. Kulbashian [143] The Commission and Mr. Warman did not establish that Mr. Kulbashian was involved in the drafting or editing of any of the Hate Message material found on the tri-cityskins.com website. For that matter, it was not proven that he contributed any of the Hate Messages that were found on the wpcect.com website or in the Vinland Voice newsletter, prior to Mr. Richardson's arrest. I have found, however, that Mr. Kulbashian contributed to the newsletter's content thereafter by drafting several messages, including the message that was directed against Mr. Warman personally.\n[144] On the other hand, all of the Hate Messages (including those on the tri-cityskins.com website) were caused to be communicated via the Internet through Mr. Kulbashian's direct involvement, as the provider of web hosting and related technical services. While his participation did not include drafting the many of the Hate Messages, I am persuaded that he caused all the Hate Messages to be communicated, and that he did so wilfully.\n[145] Mr. Kulbashian argued that his penalty should be reduced on account of his conduct, once informed of the nature of the material being posted. Thus, when Mr. Wilson's fellow police officer called Mr. Kulbashian to complain about the newsletter article that had named Mr. Wilson personally, Mr. Kulbashian had the reference removed from the website within hours. In general, Mr. Kulbashian takes issue with the fact that Mr. Wilson, Mr. Warman, and the Commission did not notify him of any objectionable material having been found on the website, before going ahead and laying criminal charges against him or filing the human rights complaint, as the case may be. Mr. Kulbashian contends that he was too busy to keep track of the material being posted on the Internet through his web server. He claims that if a notice of complaint had been made to him about the Hate Messages, he would have had the material taken off the Internet as promptly as the Vinland Voice article about Mr. Wilson.\n[146] This argument, however, assumes a false naivet\u00e9 on Mr. Kulbashian's part. He knew that a good number of clients were racialist. They shared the same post office box as his business, Affordable Space.com. He was a key member of the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. He acknowledged having designed the template for its website, wpcect.com. Moreover, Mr. Kulbashian wrote articles and commentary in its newsletter, the Vinland Voice. The name alone of this group should have alerted him to the possibility that the messages on the website may violate the Act. In addition, as a regular member of the Tri-City Skins, he likely was familiar with the organization's website. Indeed, he was so mindful of the likelihood of his clients' posting hateful messages that one of the reasons he opted to use a computer server situated outside Canada was to evade s. 13 of the Act.\n[147] It lacks credulity, therefore, for Mr. Kulbashian to come today before the Tribunal and feign ignorance of the nature of the material that was being communicated by way of his web hosting services. On the contrary, the above demonstrates that he was aware of the content of the material, and consciously and deliberately enabled its dissemination. This is wilful conduct within the meaning of the Act.\n[148] With respect to the existence of prior discriminatory practices, while there was some mention in the evidence of a prior arrest for assault that was allegedly hate related, I have insufficient information from which to draw any conclusions.\n[149] The Commission did not lead any evidence regarding Mr. Kulbashian's ability to pay the penalty. The Tribunal in Warman v. Kyburz, supra, seemed to accept the proposition that the burden may rest on a respondent to demonstrate his ability to pay the penalty. In that case, however, the Tribunal took into account evidence that was unsworn and untested by cross-examination. Indeed, s. 50(3) of the Act authorizes the Tribunal to accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or otherwise, that it sees fit, whether or not that evidence or information would be admissible in a court of law. In the present case, although Mr. Kulbashian did not testify, in the course of the hearing process, it emerged that he is a college student in his mid-20's who resides at his parents' home. He is raising a young child on his own. While the available information is not conclusive, I believe that Mr. Kulbashian's financial means are fairly limited, and that his ability to pay is accordingly restricted.\n[150] Taking all of these factors into account, I order Mr. Kulbashian to pay a penalty in the amount of $1,000. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of Mr. Kulbashian's being notified of this decision.\n(ii) Mr. Richardson [151] There is no evidence of any involvement by Mr. Richardson with respect to the tri-cityskins.com website. I have, however, determined that, up until his arrest, he was directly involved in the drafting, editing, and posting of the Hate Messages in the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's newsletter. The communication of these Hate Messages was obviously wilful. There is no evidence before me of any prior discriminatory practices by him.\n[152] No evidence was formally adduced with respect to Mr. Richardson's ability to pay a penalty but based on information that was gleaned during the hearing process, I am persuaded that he is a person of very modest financial means. He indicated that he is on a fixed income due to an undisclosed disability. When the Tribunal considered conducting a portion of the hearing in Ottawa, Mr. Richardson made it clear that he lacked the resources to pay for his travel and accommodations. He required the assistance of a parent for transportation from the family's home in Hamilton to the hearing in Oakville. Having regard to all of the circumstances, I order Mr. Richardson to pay a penalty of $1,000. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of Mr. Richardson's being notified of this decision.\n(iii) The Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team [153] Although the Hate Messages posted on the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team's websites were, in my view, somewhat less severe than those found on tri-cityskins.com, the messages exposed persons to hatred and contempt, just the same. These messages were deliberately placed on the Internet, a method that allowed them to be communicated to as large an audience as possible.\n[154] I have no evidence of whether the group of persons known as the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team has ever engaged in any discriminatory practices in the past nor do I have any evidence of its ability to pay. In all of the circumstances, I order the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team to pay a penalty of $3,000. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada. The Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team did not formally appear at the hearing, although I have determined that Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson were key members of this group. I therefore order that the penalty must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of the date when either Mr. Kulbashian or Mr. Richardson receives this decision, whichever is earlier.\n(iv) Affordable Space.com [155] Inasmuch as Affordable Space.com was the business through which Mr. Kulbashian provided his web hosting services to the websites that carried the Hate Messages, it is in contravention of the Act to the same extent as Mr. Kulbashian. Thus, I am prepared to impute the wilfulness of Mr. Kulbashian's conduct to that of the business though which he operated. I do not know what Affordable Space.com's ability to pay a penalty may be, nor am I aware of any prior discriminatory practices in which the firm may have been engaged.\n[156] Having regard to all of these circumstances, I order Affordable Space.com to pay a penalty of $3,000. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada. I order that the penalty must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of the date when Mr. Kulbashian receives this decision.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n[1] The Respondent, Melissa Guille, filed a motion with the Tribunal requesting that the complaint against Canadian Heritage Alliance be dismissed.\n[2] The parties have very different views about what is required in order to be a person or group of persons acting in concert within the meaning of s. 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. That provision of the Act declares that it is a discriminatory practice for a person or group of persons acting in concert to communicate, by means of a telecommunication undertaking, messages that are likely to expose persons to hatred or contempt on the basis of an identifiable ground of discrimination.\n[3] Ms. Guille argues that in order to be properly named as a respondent, Canadian Heritage Alliance must be either a living human being or a corporation. According to Ms. Guille, however, Canadian Heritage Alliance is neither. It is nothing more than a website that she runs, on her own, as a service to dissident writers.\n[4] The Complainant and the Commission argue that, according to the case law on this point, it is not necessary for an organization to be incorporated in order to be properly included as a party in a s. 13 complaint. Rather, there are other indicia that are used to identify a group of persons acting in concert for the purposes of s. 13 such as a group name, a symbol, letterhead and whether there are officers or leaders of the group. The Complainant and the Commission argue that there is evidence that Canadian Heritage Alliance is more than just an Internet presence. They claim there is evidence that Canadian Heritage Alliance meets most of the criteria for a group acting in concert under s. 13(1).\n[5] The Complainant has filed an Affidavit in support of his response to the motion. Ms. Guille has also filed an Affidavit in response to that of the Complainant. There are fundamental differences between the two Affidavits. Neither affiant has been cross-examined.\n[6] Regardless of what the definition of a group of persons acting in concert might be, it is clear from the case law that such determinations must be made on a case-by-case basis and on the basis of adequate evidence.\n[7] In my view, the question of whether Canadian Heritage Alliance is a group of persons acting in concert to communicate the impugned messages is best dealt with upon completion of a hearing on the merits of the complaint. Then the Tribunal will have the benefit of a full evidentiary record upon which to base its decision.\n[8] Moreover, it must be noted that the question raised in this motion is not just whether Canadian Heritage Alliance was a group of persons acting in concert, but rather whether it was a group of persons acting in concert to communicate the impugned messages. Therefore, an inquiry into the question of whether Canadian Heritage Alliance is properly named as a Respondent in this complaint will likely involve an examination of other aspects of the complaint such as the communication of the impugned messages, which will be dealt with during the hearing on the merits of the complaint.\n[9] At the hearing, the Complainant will bear the burden of establishing, on a prima facie basis, all of the constituent elements of a violation of s. 13(1) of the Act including whether a group of persons called Canadian Heritage Alliance acted in concert to communicate the impugned messages. Ms. Guille will then have an opportunity to challenge that evidence and to contest the definition of the term a group acting in concert to communicate.\n[10] For these reasons, I have decided that the issue of whether Canadian Heritage Alliance is properly named as a Respondent in this case should be decided after a full hearing on the merits of the complaint.\n[11] Ms. Guille's motion is dismissed without prejudice to her right to renew it at the hearing on the merits of the complaint.\nSigned by Karen A.

Hadjis\n[1] The Canadian Human Rights Commission has brought a motion requesting that the complaint dated September 7, 2003, be amended to add sexual orientation as one of the prohibited grounds on the basis of which the Respondent is alleged to have discriminated against persons or groups of persons. The Complainant has not made any submissions in regard to the motion, but I can safely assume that he endorses the Commission's motion.\n[2] Respondent Counsel has informed the Tribunal that her client takes no position on the motion.\n[3] I have reviewed the Commission's motion and its supporting documentation. It is evident that the proposed amendment does not rely on new facts. It stems from the same set of facts already contained in the complaint form.\n[4] Furthermore, it is not plain and obvious that the amendments to the allegations could not possibly succeed.\n[5] The Commission's motion is therefore granted. The complaint will be amended to include sexual orientation to the list of grounds on the basis of which the Respondent is alleged to have discriminated against persons or groups of persons.\n[6] The Respondent had requested leave to file further submissions on his constitutional motion, in the event that the Commission's motion was granted. I have already directed that the constitutional question will be addressed along with all the other final submissions, at the end of the hearing. However, I take it that the Respondent is seeking, in light of the amendment, to complete his Statement of Particulars, Disclosure, and Production, pursuant to Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, by also addressing the additional ground of sexual orientation.\n[7] Accordingly, I direct that the Respondent may do so by the date when he was already scheduled to file his expert reports, April 24, 2006.\nsigned by\nAthanasios D.

The parties have been unable to reach agreement on two claims.\n[2] I was originally concerned that these are new claims, which are not properly before me. Mr. Gordon has satisfied me, however, that this is not the case. It is merely that the hearing did not proceed to the stage where a proper itemization of expenses could be made.\n[3] The first claim is for Ms. Brown's initial consultations with Mr. Finding. The Respondent opposes this, on the basis that the decision from Justice Hansen clearly holds that the Tribunal has no power to award costs for legal services provided by a lay person. Mr. Gordon's response is that the initial consultations come within an exception to the general rule regarding legal fees.\n[4] The difficulty is that the exception applies to legal fees, which are only recoverable under Justice Hansen's ruling if they have been paid to a lawyer. At this point, I can only proceed on the assumption that Mr. Finding was providing legal services. It follows that his fees cannot be recovered. If Mr. Finding was providing some other kind of service, he will have to submit an affidavit outlining the nature of those services. This would be subject to cross-examination.\n[5] The second matter is a claim for legal fees. This concerns the legal fees that Mr. Gordon charged the Complainant, in making submissions on the issue of damages. I agree with Mr. Gordon that I am bound by my earlier ruling here, in which I held that the Tribunal has the power to award costs for legal fees.\n[6] The Respondent has nevertheless submitted that any claim for legal fees must follow the Federal Court Tariff. I followed this procedure in Brooks v. Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans, 2005 CHRT 26 (2005\/07\/12), primarily because it dealt with a complex claim for a large sum.\n[7] The amount that Mr. Gordon is requesting is relatively small. The significant fact, however, is that it is contested. I agree with the Respondent that the Tariff should be used in cases where the claim is disputed. The alternative is to adopt an ad hoc approach, which is more haphazard and less attuned to the law in the area.\n[8] The purpose of the Federal Court Tariff is to provide an orderly, principled framework in which disputed claims can be resolved. The provisions of the Tariff are in keeping with the general caselaw and offers a well-considered methodology, which would assist anyone in determining what costs are appropriate. I think it would be a mistake to ignore it.\n[9] I would accordingly ask Mr. Gordon to submit a Bill of Costs, in accordance with the Federal Court Tariff, along with a letter justifying his claim. This should be submitted to the Tribunal by March 27th. The Respondent will have until April 7th to respond. The Complainant will then have until April 14th for any further submissions. If Mr. Gordon wishes to submit an affidavit from Mr. Finding, I am prepared to change the dates to accommodate that.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMarch 16, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT769\/1903\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nJacqueline Brown v.

Jensen\n[1] In a complaint dated June 8, 2004, Mr. Richard Warman alleged that the Respondents, Mr. Glenn Bahr and Western Canada for Us, violated sections 12(a) and 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act by communicating and publishing hate messages. The matter is now scheduled for a hearing commencing on May 23, 2006.\n[2] Mr. Bahr has filed a motion requesting that the hearing in this matter be adjourned pending the outcome of Warman v. Marc Lemire (T1073\/5405). In that case, which also involves alleged violations of s. 13(1) of the Act, the Respondent has challenged the constitutionality of sections 13 and 54 of the Act.\n[3] On December 19, 2005, a direction was provided in Warman v. Lemire indicating that the constitutional challenge would be dealt with in the course of the hearing into the complaint, and no longer as a preliminary matter. On February 23, 2006, the Tribunal granted interested party status to a number of organizations for the purpose of providing their input on the constitutional question (Warman v. Lemire, Ruling 2006 CHRT 8). Hearing dates in this matter have not yet been set.\n[4] Mr. Bahr has stated that he too intends to challenge the constitutionality of sections 13(1) and 54 of the CHRA. However, he has not yet served Notice of the Constitutional Questions as required by the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure.\n[5] Mr. Bahr argues that it would be a more efficient use of resources for all concerned to have the constitutional challenge in the Lemire case dealt with first. Moreover, he argues that the issues raised in his complaint are now moot. The Western Canada For Us website was apparently removed in May of 2004 and has not been re-activated. As part of his bail conditions resulting from a charge under s. 319 of the Criminal Code, Mr. Bahr is enjoined from using the Internet in any way. Therefore, the Respondent argues, not only is the allegedly offensive material no longer available to the public, there is very little risk that any further material will be posted in the future.\n[6] The Complainant and the Canadian Human Rights Commission strongly oppose the motion. They argue that s. 48.9(1) of the Act requires the Tribunal to proceed as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and procedural fairness will permit. They further argue that the Tribunal must proceed with an inquiry on the presumption that the legislation is valid until such time as a judicial determination has been made to the contrary.\n[7] In Leger v. Canadian National Railway Company, Interim Ruling, November 26, 1999 (CHRT); stay application dismissed [2000] F.C.J. 243 (T.D.), this Tribunal held that the exercise of its discretion to grant an adjournment is governed by the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice as well as the regime of the CHRA, which places a premium on the expeditious resolution of discrimination complaints. The Federal Court of Canada has clearly stated that there is a strong public interest in having Human Rights Tribunals proceed as expeditiously as possible (Bell Canada v. Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (1997), 127 F.T.R. 44 at para. 44).\n[8] Mr. Bahr's arguments regarding procedural fairness and natural justice would appear to be that the costs involved in mounting a constitutional challenge in the present case are prohibitive. He will be put at an unfair disadvantage if he has to muster the resources to do this given what he is facing in the criminal courts. Mr. Bahr argues, therefore, that he should be permitted to await the outcome in Warman v. Lemire before he proceeds with his case.\n[9] I can appreciate Mr. Bahr's situation. However, there are some difficulties with the motion as it is currently framed. First of all, strictly speaking, the Tribunal's decision in the Lemire matter will not bind the Tribunal in the present case (Donald Lange, The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada, 2nd edition, Toronto: 2004, at p. 423). Therefore, unless the constitutional issue in Warman v. Lemire reaches the Federal Court or higher, the Tribunal member in the present case will be required to hear and determine the issues, including the constitutional question, on the merits of this particular case. Thus, there is no particular economy in adjourning the matter until the Tribunal renders a decision in Warman v. Lemire.\n[10] It follows that there is no guarantee that the Tribunal's decision in Warman v. Lemire will provide Mr. Bahr with what he is seeking. It is only if and when a judicial decision at the Federal or Supreme Court is rendered on the constitutional question, that the Tribunal will be bound by the result and further challenges to the legislation at the Tribunal level will be rendered moot. Adjourning the case until Warman v. Lemire has been conclusively determined would push the hearing dates beyond what is acceptable under the Act, in my view.\n[11] For these reasons, Mr. Bahr's motion for an adjournment pending the outcome in Warman v. Lemire is denied.\nsigned by\nKaren A. Jensen\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMarch 22, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1087\/6805 and T1088\/6905\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRichard Warman v.

Jensen\n[1] On November 24, 2003, the Complainant filed a complaint against Mr. Craig Harrison alleging that Mr. Harrison had communicated hate messages via the Internet contrary to s. 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The matter has been scheduled for a hearing on April 3, 4 and 5, 2006.\n[2] The Complainant has requested that the hearing be adjourned for approximately four to six weeks. The Canadian Human Rights Commission supports this request. The reason for the request is that Mr. Harrison has denied that he was the person who communicated the impugned messages on the Internet. Therefore, the Commission and the Complainant both intend to present evidence at the hearing that will address the issue of the identity of the individual who posted the impugned messages. They state that they have used their best efforts to obtain this information as quickly as possible, but it has recently become apparent that an additional period of about four to six weeks is needed to obtain the information.\n[3] Mr. Warman intends to present evidence from a criminal trial involving Mr. Harrison which he states will provide proof that the Respondent was the person who communicated the messages. During the case management teleconference on March 16, 2006 to discuss the Complainant's motion, Mr. Warman indicated that the evidence from the trial will likely provide additional information such as the Internet protocol address of the computer used to communicate the messages in question. This, the Complainant alleges, will assist the Tribunal to determine the identity of the person who communicated the messages.\n[4] The Commission, for its part, has requested that Bell Sympatico provide information regarding the identity of the user of an e-mail address that accompanied the messages that are the subject of the complaint. It is anticipated that this information will also shed light on the issue of the use that can be made of another person's e-mail address. This, it is argued, is relevant to the identity of the communicator of the impugned messages.\n[5] The Respondent strongly objects to the adjournment. He argues that the Commission and the Complainant have known for some time now that his defense to the complaint was one of mistaken identity. Therefore, they had ample opportunity to obtain the information they needed before the hearing was due to start on April 3. All of the parties agreed to the dates of April 3, 4 and 5, 2006 and, on that basis, Mr. Harrison made arrangements to take time off work. He cannot change those dates now.\n[6] The Respondent further argues that the information that is being sought will not establish that he was the communicator of the messages. Finally, Mr. Harrison argues that he has incurred considerable costs as a result of the human rights complaint process. He is fed up and wants to have the matter resolved as quickly as possible.\n[7] I have some sympathy for the Respondent's position. It would appear that the Commission and the Complainant have indeed known for some time now that the Respondent was denying that he communicated the impugned messages. Mr. Harrison stated that this has been his position since the investigation was conducted by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In his Statement of Particulars, dated January 13, 2006, Mr. Harrison alleged that he did not post the messages which are the subject of the complaint.\n[8] In its Reply to Mr. Harrison's Statement of Particulars, the Commission requested further details about Mr. Harrison's claim that he did not communicate the messages. The Commission also stated that, depending on the additional information it received from the Respondent, it might call an expert witness, possibly in computers and websites.\n[9] In a letter dated February 4, 2006, the Respondent provided further details about his defense. He stated that his computer was not working and was in the repair shop during the time when the messages were posted. He also stated that other people had access to his computer.\n[10] In his Notice of Motion, the Complainant stated that he received the Respondent's further particulars on February 13, 2006. During the case management call to discuss the motion, Mr. Warman indicated that he requested the information as soon as possible after he received the Respondent's further Particulars. Due to a processing backlog at the agency that provides the information Mr. Warman has requested, he is unable to obtain the information for another four to six weeks.\n[11] Counsel for the Commission wrote to Bell Sympatico on February 16, 2006 to obtain the information described above. He was recently informed by Bell Sympatico that it will take three to four weeks to obtain the requested information.\n[12] It is not clear to me why the Commission and Mr. Warman were unable to proceed with their requests for information on the basis of the information that was provided in the Respondent's first Statement of Particulars in January 2006. It was evident from that document that Mr. Harrison was denying that he posted the messages on the basis that they were inconsistent with his values and family background and on the basis that he did not have access to the computer from which the messages were sent during the relevant period of time. I must say that I was not very satisfied with the explanation provided by the Commission and the Complainant during the case management teleconference.\n[13] Be that as it may, I recognize that the information that has been sought by the Commission and the Complainant is relevant to a key issue in this case - the identity of the person who posted the impugned messages. I also accept the statements of the Commission and Mr. Warman that there is no way to obtain this information by April 3, 2006 when the hearing is scheduled to begin. Therefore, I am satisfied that the request for an adjournment is denied, the Commission and the Complainant will be denied the opportunity to properly present their case.\n[14] In deciding whether to grant an adjournment, the Tribunal must weigh the goal of resolving human rights complaints in a timely manner against the requirement to be fair to all parties and to provide them with a full and ample opportunity to present their case (Leger v. Canadian National Railway Company, Interim Ruling, November 26, 1999 (CHRT); stay application dismissed [2000] F.C.J. 243 (T.D.)). In this case, Mr. Warman and the Commission are requesting a relatively short adjournment in order to be able to properly present their case. Mr. Harrison may be understandably frustrated by the postponement, but his opportunity to defend against the complaint is not being delayed unduly.\n[15] For these reasons, the Complainant's motion for an adjournment is granted. The Tribunal Registry is instructed to contact the parties to arrange a teleconference to set new dates for the hearing.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] I have had the opportunity to review the parties' submissions on the issue of venue for the hearing into this complaint.\n[2] The complaint involves allegations that the Respondents, Ms. Melissa Guille and Canadian Heritage Alliance, communicated hate messages through an Internet website in violation of s. 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Complainant, Mr. Richard Warman, claims to have viewed the website on a computer in Ottawa, where he resides. Ms. Guille states that her computer location at the time of the alleged communications was in Kitchener or London, Ontario.\n[3] The Complainant requests that the complaint be heard in Ottawa. In the alternative, he requests that the matter be heard in Toronto. The Canadian Human Rights Commission takes the same position. Ms. Guille requests that the matter be heard in Kitchener or London. In the alternative, she requests that the matter be heard in Toronto.\n[4] It is the usual practice of the Tribunal to hold hearings in the place where the alleged discrimination occurred. However, this is not a hard and fast rule and the Tribunal strives to accommodate the parties where it is appropriate to do so (Baumbach v. Deer Lake Education Authority 2004 CHRT 13).\n[5] In Warman v. Lemire 2006 CHRT 7, this Tribunal noted that in cases such as this involving the alleged communication of hate messages over the Internet, it is difficult to fix the location where the discrimination allegedly occurred. Did it occur where the messages were viewed on the Complainant's computer? Or, did it occur in the location of the Respondent's computer where the messages were alleged to have been communicated?\n[6] In Warman v. Lemire, the Tribunal determined that the place most closely connected with the alleged discriminatory conduct was the greater metropolitan area where the Respondent was located. The Tribunal accommodated both parties' needs with respect to the venue within the greater metropolitan area for the hearing.\n[7] Arguably, the place most closely associated with the alleged discriminatory conduct in this case is the London area. The Complainant, however, has stated that he would suffer serious hardship if he was required to attend a hearing in the London area. Although a hearing in Toronto would still result in some hardship, it would be less so. In her submissions, Ms. Guille stated that although she would prefer London or Kitchener as the venue for the hearing, she would accept Toronto as an alternative venue.\n[8] The witnesses and parties in this case are from Ottawa and the London area, with the possibility of an expert witness which has yet to be determined.\n[9] In view of the above-noted factors, I am of the view that the best way to accommodate the needs of the parties and the witnesses in this case is to hold the hearing in Toronto. Both the Respondent and the Complainant have stated that they would experience significant hardship if the hearing was held in the opposing party's preferred venue and both have proposed Toronto as the alternative to their preferred venue. The Commission is in agreement that Toronto is an acceptable alternative venue.\n[10] Accordingly, I direct the hearing into this complaint to be held in Toronto. The exact address is to be determined and will be communicated to the parties by the Tribunal at a later time.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] This ruling addresses two requests made by the Respondent, Mr. Glenn Bahr, for documents that are allegedly relevant to the issues raised in a complaint against him and another Respondent.\n[2] The complaint, filed by Mr. Richard Warman, involves allegations that the Respondents, Mr. Glenn Bahr and Western Canada For Us, communicated hate messages through an Internet website in violation of s. 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[3] The Respondent Bahr has requested that the Complainant disclose the following documents:\nthe Complainant's speaking notes entitled Maximum Disruption: Stopping Neo-Nazis by (Almost) Any Means Necessary from a speech that he gave at a conference hosted by a group called Anti-Racist Action; the Complainant's contribution to B'Nai Brith's 2005 Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents; the Complainant's contract with B'Nai Brith for these and other writings; Other writings Mr. Warman may have done for B'Nai Brith.\n[4] The Respondent Bahr states that these materials are arguably relevant because they may prove that the Complainant has a particular animus against Mr. Bahr that will taint the proceedings. He further states that the materials are relevant to Mr. Warman's credibility. The Respondent Bahr intends to assert that Mr. Warman's complaint was brought in bad faith and is part of a campaign to injure people whose views he opposes. Finally, the Respondent Bahr argues that the fact that the speaking notes were disclosed and admitted into evidence in Warman v. Winnicki (T1021\/0205) is highly suggestive of their relevance in this matter.\n[5] The Complainant and the Commission argue that the material is not arguably relevant since it does not relate to a matter in issue in the complaint. The Complainant is not seeking any remedies for himself in this complaint. The issues to be determined, therefore, are limited to whether the Respondents repeatedly communicated hate messages by means of the Internet and, if so, what the appropriate remedy would be. The requested material is not arguably relevant to these issues.\n[6] I find that the Respondent Bahr has not established the arguable relevance of the requested material to the issues that are raised in this case. While the threshold for arguable relevance is low and the tendency is now towards more, rather than less disclosure, the nexus between the issues to be proven and the requested material must nonetheless, be demonstrated.\n[7] The first step in determining whether a document is arguably relevant is to identify the facts that are in issue in the case. The question to be asked is this: what facts must be proved in order to establish or defend against the case before the Tribunal? The central factual issue to be determined in the present case is whether the Respondents, acting individually or in concert, repeatedly communicated by means of the Internet, messages that were likely to expose people to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that those people are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[8] The Respondent Bahr has argued that the Complainant's credibility is relevant to his motivation for bringing the complaint. However, at this stage of the proceedings, the Complainant's motivation for bringing the complaint is not in issue. It is the Canadian Human Rights Commission that has the power, pursuant to s. 41(1)(d), to dismiss a complaint if it is of the view that the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith. If the Commission does not exercise its discretion under this provision, and instead refers the complaint to the Tribunal for further inquiry, the Respondent may file an application for judicial review of the Commission's decision. However, the Tribunal does not have the authority to review the Commission's decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal (International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Maritime Section), Local 400 v. Oster, 2001 FCT 1115 at para. 29). Once the complaint has been referred to the Tribunal, the Tribunal is required, by virtue of section 50(1) of the Act to inquire into the complaint.\n[9] Thus, the Complainant's motivation for bringing the complaint is not a relevant issue at this stage in the proceedings. Moreover, the fact that the speaking notes were disclosed in Warman v. Winnicki does not mean that the same material must be disclosed in the present case. The arguable relevance of material must be determined on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the issues raised in each case. In Warman v. Winnicki, the Complainant alleged that the Respondent had engaged in retaliatory conduct. The Complainant also made a claim for personal compensation under s. 53 of the Act. There were, therefore, different factual issues to be determined in Warman v. Winnicki than in the present case. The Respondent has not established the arguable relevance of the Complainant's credibility to the issues raised in the present case.\n[10] For these reasons, I decline to order the disclosure of the documents listed above. I note, however, the Complainant's suggestion in his submissions that some of the requested material is available on the Internet. Although the Respondent is apparently enjoined from using the Internet as part of his bail conditions in a criminal matter, his representative has access to the Internet. Therefore, some of the requested material may be available without this Tribunal's intervention.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling regarding the production of documents by third parties. The complaint involves allegations that the Respondent, Mr. Craig Harrison, allegedly communicated hate messages over the Internet contrary to s. 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Complainant, Richard Warman, has filed a motion requesting that the Tribunal order a person who is not a party to this complaint, Mr. Marc Lemire, to produce documentation relating to pseudonyms that were allegedly used by the Respondent in this case. The Complainant states that this information is relevant and necessary to prove the identity of the person who communicated the material that is alleged to violate s. 13(1) of the Act.\n[3] The Complainant argues that the Tribunal has the authority under subsections 50(2) and 50(3) of the Act to order people who are not parties to the proceedings to produce documents. I disagree.\n[4] Subsection 50(1) of the Act requires the Tribunal to hold an inquiry into complaints that are referred to it by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Subsection 50(2) provides the Tribunal with the authority to determine all questions of law and fact necessary to determining the matter. Subsection 50(3) grants the Tribunal additional powers to enable it to conduct a thorough inquiry. In particular, subsection 50(3)(a) authorizes the Tribunal to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses to give oral or written evidence and to produce any documents considered necessary. Subsection 50(3)(c) allows the Tribunal to receive and accept evidence whether or not it would be admissible in a court of law. These provisions do not provide the Tribunal with the authority to compel people who are not witnesses or parties to the proceedings to produce documents. Mr. Lemire has not been listed as a witness in this case.\n[5] The Complainant relies upon Metcalfe v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 882 and others (No. 7) 2005 BCHRT 165 as authority for the proposition that this Tribunal has the power to order third party production of documents. I disagree. Metcalfe (No. 7) is a case from the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. That Tribunal is subject to very different legislation. The British Columbia Human Rights Code was amended recently to incorporate a provision of the Administrative Tribunal Act, S.B.C. 2004, c. 45 that explicitly gives the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal the power to order production of documents from third parties. The Tribunal in Metcalfe (No. 7) noted that prior to that amendment it did not have the power to order third party production and for that reason it had declined to do so.\n[6] In my view, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal does not have the power to order the production of documents from third parties who are not witnesses. For that reason, I decline to order the production of the documents requested by the Complainant in his motion.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] The Respondent, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) filed a motion with the Tribunal requesting the Tribunal strike the Complainant's new allegation of discrimination relating to the 1996 Gender Buy-Back.\n[2] The grounds for the motion are that the Complainant and the Commission have recently asserted a new ground of discrimination which was not part of the original complaint; that RBC did not have the opportunity to raise the objection that the new allegation is untimely; and, raising the new allegation of discrimination at this time breaches the rules of natural justice and is highly prejudicial to RBC.\n[3] The Canadian Human Rights Commission has filed a responding motion that the Tribunal decline jurisdiction to hear the Respondent's motion; or, in the alternative, declare that the Respondent's motion is premature and reserve the right of the Respondent to argue the motion at the end of the hearing on a full evidentiary record.\n[4] The complaint referenced by the motions is that of Yvonne Sugimoto, a retired employee of RBC. Her complaint is dated December 9, 2002.\n[5] In her complaint, the Complainant alleges that RBC has discriminated against her as well as 700 other current and former female employees, by treating them in an adverse, differential manner on the ground of sex, contrary to ss. 7, 10, and 21 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The issue is their pension entitlement.\n[6] Her complaint sets out in very long and complex detail, the evolution of RBC's Pension Plan during the period from 1970 to 2001, including changes to the enrollment criteria and other amendments to the Plan.\n[7] In terms of specific allegations of discrimination, the Complainant claims that the September 2001 Re-opener amendment to the Plan is discriminatory as RBC chose to give an advantage to male employees born between February 1950 and April 1953, by allowing them to retire with full pension benefits at age 56. Similarly situated RBC female employees could retire with full pension only at age 61 years, 10 months.\n[8] The genesis of the Respondent's motion is found in a May 25, 2005 letter from RBC to the Commission and the Complainant. In this letter, RBC sets out that, It has now come to our attention that the Commission and\/or the Complainant may be taking the position that the 1996 Gender Buy-Back offered in 1996 to female employees of the Bank, including the Complainant, was discriminatory and contrary to the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act. RBC, in its letter, asked the Commission and the Complainant for clarification of their position. There is nothing in the letter as to when and how this came to RBC's attention.\n[9] The Commission's clarification, sent on May 30, 2005, was that the combination of the 2001 Re-opener and the 1996 Gender Buy-Back has an adverse impact on women. As such, it constitutes discrimination contrary to ss. 7 and 10 of the CHRA.\n[10] On May 31, 2005, the Complainant responded that it has always been her position that the 1996 Gender Buy-Back and the 2001 Re-opener are inextricably linked and cannot be viewed separately. It is the combination of these two events which has had an adverse impact on women, contrary to ss. 7 and 10 of the CHRA. The Complainant added that she and the other women should have been eligible for the pension option offered in 2001.\n[11] The Complainant was hired by the RBC on February 23, 1970. Her date of birth is October 4, 1951. When she joined the RBC, she was 18 years, 4 months old. In 1970, the eligibility age for membership in the Plan was 21 years for men and 24 years for women.\n[12] On May 1, 1974, RBC amended the Plan. The eligibility age to join the Plan was raised to 30 years of age for both men and women. The Plan was also amended to provide a non-contributory option. The non-contributory option allowed employees who had membership in the Plan, but were not yet 30 years of age, to continue as contributory members or suspend their membership until they attained 30. The Complainant was not offered this option of suspending membership in the Plan. She was not a member as at May 1, 1974. She was not 24 years old.\n[13] On September 1, 1980, the Plan was again amended and the eligibility age was changed to the earlier of 25 years of age or 5 years of continuous employment with RBC. At that time, the Complainant had been with RBC for over 10 years and was 28 years, 9 months old. She joined the Plan effective March 1, 1980.\n[14] In 1996, RBC, in order to deal with the past inequity in pension benefits, offered women who had continuously worked for the Bank since May 1, 1974, and, who were age 21 to 24 on May 1, 1974, a one-time option to purchase up to three years of contributory Plan membership. This is the 1996 Gender Buy-Back.\n[15] The Complainant took up this option and on January 29, 1996 she purchased 19 months of pension plan entitlement at a cost to her of $4,834. The Complainant was given a deemed date joined pension plan of August 1, 1978.\n[16] On July 12, 1996, the Complainant wrote to RBC commending it for its attempt to eliminate the Plan gender gap. However she pointed out in her letter, that the 1996 Gender Buy-Back did not eliminate the Plan gender gap for the period May 1, 1974 to March 1, 1980. The 1996 Gender Buy-Back reduced the gender gap by 19 months, but there still existed a 72 month gap between men and women, similarly situated in terms of age and employment with the RBC.\n[17] The Complainant concluded her letter by asking what efforts RBC was making to close this remaining pension gap.\n[18] RBC responded to the Complainant's concerns on September 17, 1996. In its letter, RBC pointed out that it had considered, when developing the 1996 Gender Buy-Back, allowing female employees to buy back service after May 1, 1974 up to age 30. However, RBC concluded that to do so would be unfair to other employees who were members of the plan as of May 1, 1974 and who had opted out until age 30.\n[19] The Complainant took no further action at that time with respect to her concerns.\n[20] In the 1990's, RBC came to the conclusion that the May 1, 1974 amendment to the Plan could be read as having a third option. The third option would have allowed a RBC employee, male or female, under 30 years of age on May 1, 1974, who was a member of the Plan, to remain in the Plan as a non-contributory member until attaining age 30.\n[21] As a result, on September 26, 2001, RBC offered all employees who had continuous employment from May 1, 1974, and who had elected to suspend their plan membership until age 30, the option to receive non-contributory service equal to the period from the suspension date to the date that they turned 30 years of age, (up to a maximum of 70 months).\n[22] It is the 2001 Re-opener that the Complainant, in her complaint, alleges is discriminatory. She alleges it gives a significant pension benefit to RBC male employees born between February 1950 and April 1953 with continuous service, which benefit is not accorded to RBC female employees born between those dates and having the same period of continuous service.\nDECISION [23] In my opinion, the Respondent's motion is premature. It should be dealt with in the context of a complete evidentiary record after a full hearing on the merits of the complaint. I say this for a number of reasons.\n[24] First, there is nothing in the complaint that alleges that the 1996 Gender Buy-Back was discriminatory in itself. Nor do the clarifications of the Commission and the Complainant allege that the 1996 Gender Buy-Back in itself is discriminatory.\n[25] For the Commission, it is the combination of the 1996 Gender Buy-Back and the 2001 Re-opener that is discriminatory. For the Complainant, the two amendments are inextricably linked and it is a combination of the two that is allegedly discriminatory. In my view, the positions of the Commission and the Complainant on this question require additional clarification.\n[26] Second, and equally to the point, is the Complainant's assertion that it has always been her position that the 1996 and 2001 amendments are inextricably linked. The inference being that no new discriminatory allegation is being raised. Whether this is the case factually and whether the Respondent was aware of this, was not adequately dealt with by the parties at the hearing of the Respondent's motion and needs to be fleshed out.\n[27] Thirdly, the Tribunal's normal case management process has not been completed. This process requires disclosure from the parties. Disclosure includes relevant document disclosure, witness disclosure and a statement of particulars.\n[28] The statement of particulars is akin to a statement of claim and a statement of defense in a civil proceeding. The statement of particulars of both the Commission and the Complainant would detail the facts relied upon by these two parties, the issues raised and the remedy they are seeking. The Respondent's statement of particulars would be its response, as is the case with any defense. All disclosure was suspended pending this motion.\n[29] The Respondent is asking the Tribunal to strike the new allegation of discrimination before any pleadings have been filed; the allegation has only been raised in correspondence between counsel for the parties.\n[30] Moreover, depending on the remedy that the Commission and the Complainant are seeking, it may not be necessary to decide whether the 1996 Gender Buy-Back is discriminatory.\n[31] It is also possible however that I am being asked to make a decision on a preliminary basis which may well decide the complaint on the merits without a full hearing. It is inadvisable for the Tribunal to make such a decision in the above-described circumstances.\n[32] Accordingly, I reserve my decision on both the Respondent's motion and the Commission's motion until a full evidentiary record is established at a hearing.\n[33] This is without prejudice to the rights of the Respondent and the Commission to argue their respective motions, on the full record, as part of their closing submissions.\nSigned by\nJ.

THE COMPLAINTS [1] This is a decision regarding two complaints filed by Mr. Richard Warman against Mr. Tomasz Winnicki. The first complaint involves the alleged communication of hate messages contrary to s. 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act). The second complaint involves allegations of retaliation or threatened retaliation contrary to s. 14.1 of the Act.\n[2] I heard both complaints together in July and December, 2005. The Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) participated fully in the hearing. The Complainant, who is a lawyer, represented himself. The Respondent represented himself for the first day of the hearing and thereafter was represented by counsel. The Respondent chose not to testify.\nII. WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES GAVE RISE TO THESE COMPLAINTS? [3] The Complainant testified that, about 15 years ago, he became interested in the issue of hate speech. He began to monitor the activities of organized groups and individuals in Canada that he suspected were spreading hate messages.\n[4] During the course of his monitoring activities, the Complainant became aware of material on the Internet that was apparently posted by the Respondent, Mr. Tomasz Winnicki. He testified that he thought the material violated s. 13(1), the hate message provision of the Canadian Human Rights Act, in that it was likely to expose people of the Jewish faith to hatred or contempt. As a result, on September 7, 2003, the Complainant filed a human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. He appended material that he downloaded from the Internet, which was allegedly communicated by the Respondent, to the s. 13(1) complaint.\n[5] The Complainant testified that he subsequently became aware of other messages on the Internet which he believed were posted by the Respondent in retaliation against him for filing a human rights complaint. The Complainant then filed a retaliation complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated June 1, 2004 alleging that the Respondent had violated s. 14.1 of the Act. The Complainant appended the allegedly retaliatory messages to the s. 14.1 complaint.\n[6] The Canadian Human Rights Commission subsequently decided to refer both complaints to the Tribunal for further inquiry. After the Commission had referred the complaints to the Tribunal, the Complainant testified that he found additional material on the Internet that was allegedly posted by the Respondent. It was believed that this material was likely to expose people to hatred or contempt on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin and colour. As a result, on May 20, 2005, the Canadian Human Rights Commission requested leave from the Tribunal to amend the first complaint to include the additional grounds of race, national or ethnic origin and colour. The Respondent was served with the motion and the additional material that was found on the Internet.\n[7] On July 11, 2005, I granted the Commission's request to amend the s.13(1) complaint on the basis that the substance of the original complaint was not altered by the addition of the new grounds; a new discriminatory practice was not being alleged. I also found that the Respondent had been given sufficient notice to enable him to properly defend himself against the amended complaint. Accordingly, the s. 13(1) complaint was amended to include the additional grounds and the new material was appended to the revised complaint.\n[8] After the amendment was made but prior to the hearing, the Complainant testified that he found more material on the Internet that was allegedly posted by the Respondent. This material was disclosed to the Respondent before the hearing and it was alleged that the material was further evidence of the Respondent's ongoing violation of sections 13(1) and 14.1. (For ease of reference all of the material that was found on the Internet after the complaint was referred to the Tribunal, including the material that was appended to the amended complaint, will be referred to as the post-referral evidence)\n[9] On July 27, 2005, the Commission filed a motion with the Federal Court requesting an interlocutory injunction against the Respondent pending a final decision by this Tribunal. The Federal Court granted the Commission's motion on October 4, 2005 and, as a result, from that date until the date of this decision, the Respondent was prevented from communicating, by means of the Internet, messages of the kind found in the material that was filed with the Federal Court (Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Winnicki 2005 FC 1493).\n[10] Before this Tribunal, the Complainant and the Commission requested an order requiring the Respondent to cease and desist from communicating messages of the kind that were submitted with the complaints. They also sought compensation for the pain and suffering that the Complainant allegedly experienced as a result of the retaliation, in addition to special compensation and reimbursement for costs incurred by the Complainant to attend the hearing.\n[11] The Respondent, through his counsel, admitted to having communicated the messages that were the subject of the original complaints filed on September 7, 2003 and June 1, 2004. The Respondent objected, however, to the consideration of any of the post-referral material by the Tribunal on the basis that it was not part of the original complaint. The Respondent denied that any of the material exposed members of an identifiable group to hatred or contempt. He also denied having retaliated against the Complainant for filing a human rights complaint against him. Finally, the Respondent disputed the appropriateness of the remedies requested by the Complainant and the Commission.\nIII. WHAT QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS CASE? [12] I must address the following questions in this case:\nIs the Tribunal permitted to rule on material that was not included in the original complaint? What are the sources of the material that allegedly violate s. 13(1)? Did the Respondent communicate the impugned messages repeatedly, by means of the Internet? Is the material likely to expose persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? Did the Respondent retaliate against the Complainant after he filed his complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission?\n[13] For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the Respondent willfully and repeatedly communicated messages via the Internet that are likely to expose persons of the Jewish faith, black race and other non-Caucasian races, and persons of African origin to hatred or contempt. I have also concluded that the Respondent willfully retaliated against the Complainant for filing a human rights complaint. As a result, I find that both complaints against the Respondent are substantiated.\nA. Question 1 - Is the Tribunal Permitted to Rule on Material That Was Not Included In the Original Complaint? [14] Although the Respondent did not object when the Commission introduced the post-referral evidence during the hearing, at the close of the hearing the Respondent argued that the Tribunal could not consider this evidence since it essentially constituted the basis for new complaints which should have first been submitted to the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[15] I disagree with this argument for a number of reasons. Firstly, the Respondent is essentially attempting to re-litigate the motion to amend the original s. 13(1) complaint. The motion to amend the s. 13(1) complaint was granted on the basis of the post-referral evidence that was filed in support of that motion. In deciding that an amendment to the original complaint was appropriate, the issue of whether that evidence constituted the basis for a new complaint was conclusively determined. As a result of that Ruling, excerpts of the post-referral evidence were incorporated into the particulars of the amended complaint. Therefore, it cannot now be argued that the evidence that was the basis for the amendment is, in fact, the basis of a new complaint. This would effectively constitute an attempt to re-argue the motion to amend the complaint. To do so would be an abuse of process and will not be permitted (Cremasco v. Canada Post Corporation 2002\/09\/30 - Ruling No. 1, at para. 77, aff'd 2004 FCA 363).\n[16] Secondly, with regard to the second batch of post-referral evidence that was disclosed after the complaint was amended, I am also of the view that it may properly be considered by the Tribunal. The evidence does not disclose the basis for a new complaint or a new series of complaints, but rather goes to the issue of whether the Respondent was engaging in an ongoing violation of sections 14.1 and 13(1) of the Act. The amended s. 13(1) complaint specifically contemplates the possibility that additional evidence of the violation of s. 13(1) would occur by including the words and ongoing in the date of the alleged discriminatory conduct.\n[17] In LeBlanc v. Canada Post Corporation (1992), 18 C.H.R.R. D\/57, the Tribunal discussed a similar objection to the one raised by the Respondent in the present case. In that case, the Canadian Human Rights Commission indicated that it intended to lead evidence of other incidents of alleged discrimination which were not set out in the complaint form. Counsel for the Respondent objected. The Tribunal ruled that the evidence was admissible because the complaint form referred to incidents of discrimination that were ongoing and the evidence appeared to be the continuation of the complaint. Moreover, the Tribunal ruled that the Commission and the complainant are not necessarily restricted to the four corners of the complaint form. The essential question is whether it would be fair to admit the evidence. If there is no evidence of surprise and the Respondent is aware that the complaint relates to ongoing events, then it is difficult for the Respondent to argue prejudice.\n[18] In the present case, there is no evidence that the Respondent was caught be surprise by the introduction of the evidence. It was disclosed to him prior to the hearing and, as stated above, the amended s. 13(1) complaint form indicated that the complaint related to ongoing events. Finally, the Commission's application to the Federal Court for an interlocutory injunction would have been a clear signal to the Respondent that the Commission was taking issue with the Respondent's continued communication of material that was allegedly in violation of s. 13(1).\n[19] It was not indicated on the s. 14.1 complaint form that the complaint related to ongoing events. However, I find that in the context of the ongoing disclosure that was taking place prior to the hearing, and the motions that were being made before the Tribunal and the Federal Court, this is not significant. It would hardly have come as a surprise to the Respondent that any messages that were found on the Internet that could be construed as retaliatory might well be introduced as evidence at the hearing.\n[20] The Respondent argued that he was deprived of an opportunity to engage in conciliation and to respond to the post-referral messages before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. This argument rings hollow. The post-referral messages are of the same nature as the material that was submitted to the Commission as part of the original complaints. The Respondent would have had the opportunity to engage in conciliation and to respond to the messages that were part of the original complaint. It is unlikely that the additional material would have made any difference to the conciliation and settlement efforts.\n[21] The present case is very different from Canada (Attorney General) v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) (1991), F.T.R. 47 (Pitawanakwat) upon which the Respondent relies in support of his argument that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to consider the post-referral evidence. The Pitawanakwat case dealt with the Commission's jurisdiction to refer an amended complaint to the Tribunal that included a new allegation of discrimination based on a different ground some four years after the original complaint had been signed. The case did not deal with the Tribunal's jurisdiction to accept post-referral evidence.\n[22] Therefore, given that the evidence relates to the issue of the ongoing nature of the violations and the fact that the Respondent had adequate notice and an opportunity to address the post-referral evidence, I find that the Tribunal is entitled to consider the post-referral evidence.\nB. Question 2 - What are the sources of the material that allegedly violates s. 13(1)? [23] The Complainant testified that there are essentially three sources of the impugned messages: The Northern Alliance Guestbook; the Respondent's own website; and the Vanguard News Network. The majority of the impugned messages were found in the VNN Forum. However, some were from the Northern Alliance Guestbook and some from the Respondent's own website.\n(i) The Northern Alliance Guestbook [24] The Complainant testified that he viewed material on a website on the Internet called Northern Alliance. He downloaded the material that he believed was communicated by the Respondent and submitted it as an attachment to his original s. 13(1) complaint dated September 3, 2003. The Complainant testified that the Northern Alliance was a group based in London, Ontario that offered a Guestbook on the Internet where people could make on-line comments about various topics. The Guestbook consisted of a series of comments one after the other without any real structure to it. The banner across the top of the Guestbook reads:\nNorthern Alliance\nThe new voice of the Canadian majority\n[25] There were two entries to the Northern Alliance Guestbook made by the Respondent that were submitted as part of the s. 13 complaint. The Complainant testified that, to the best of his knowledge, by the time of the hearing into this matter, the Northern Alliance Guestbook had been deleted.\n(ii) The Winnicki Website [26] The Complainant testified that, while visiting the Northern Alliance Guestbook, he clicked on the link that was provided with the Respondent's comments and was taken to the following website address: WW3.sympatico.ca\/tom.winnicki. On that website he found several graphic images together with statements such as WHITE REVOLUTION .... ITZ COMING .... AND ITZ GIGANTIC... Links to websites were also provided that claimed to provide unbiased history. The Complainant testified that he believed the material on the website found at WW3.sympatico.ca\/tom.winnicki was communicated by the Respondent. He downloaded it on September 3, 2003 and appended it to his human rights complaint alleging that the communications violated s. 13(1) of the Act.\n[27] The Complainant testified that, at the time that he filed his s. 13(1) complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in September 2003, he raised concerns about the Repondent's website with Bell Sympatico. He was led to believe that Bell Sympatico ultimately shut down the WW3.sympatico.ca\/tom.winnicki website.\n(iii) The Vanguard News Network [28] The Complainant testified that he conducted an Internet search on the name Tom Winnicki. One of the results of that search led him to a website called the Vanguard News Network. The Complainant testified that to the best of his knowledge, the Vanguard News Network (VNN) was a website that was registered in the United States and was controlled by persons who lived in the United States. Among other things, the website provided news briefs from a neo-Nazi perspective. According to the Complainant, the website also provided a forum where people could discuss a number of issues.\n[29] The Complainant testified that, once he had accessed the main page of the VNN, he was then able to choose from a number of options. One of these options was the VNN Forum. When he clicked on the VNN Forum icon, he was linked to another page on the website that presented him with another set of options, known as threads. According to the Complainant, threads are topics of discussion that are initiated by members of the VNN. Members of the Forum may post (or communicate) publicly accessible messages that follow one from the other within a given thread or topic of conversation. The term This Just In introduces a new thread, or topic of discussion. There are other threads that are listed within the categories in the Forum.\n[30] According to the Complainant, becoming a member of the Forum was a relatively straightforward process that involved providing a valid e-mail address and registration information.\nC. Question 3 - Did the Respondent repeatedly communicate the impugned messages from the above noted sources by means of the Internet? (i) Who was the communicator of the impugned material? [31] Through his counsel, the Respondent admitted that he communicated the messages which were included in the original complaints that were investigated by the Canadian Human Rights Commission and subsequently referred to the Tribunal. These messages included those found by the Complainant on the Northern Alliance website and on the Winnicki website, as well as some from the VNN Forum.\n[32] It was unclear, however, whether the Respondent's admission that he communicated the impugned messages extended to the post-referral material. Therefore, I have reviewed this material and find, for the following reasons, that the Respondent was, in fact, the person who communicated the post-referral material that was filed as evidence during the hearing in this matter.\n[33] In the messages that formed part of the original complaints, the Respondent alternated between the use of the pseudonym Thexder 3D and the name Tom Winnicki. When the pseudonym was used, it was accompanied by a robot symbol.\n[34] The communicator of the post-referral messages refers to himself as Thexder 3D and Tomasz Winnicki. In one such message Tomasz Winnicki corrected a misspelling of his pseudonym stating:\nIt's Thexder not Thexter but that's of little importance. Use my real name Tomasz Winnicki from now on. Tomasz in Polish is the formal form for Tom, so you can also address me as that.\n[35] Thus, the evidence demonstrates that the Respondent, who went by the names Tom Winnicki and Tomasz Winnicki, and used the pseudonym Thexder 3D together with a robot symbol, was the person who communicated the post-referral material.\n(ii) Did the Respondent repeatedly communicate the allegedly discriminatory material? [36] In Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/453, the Tribunal held that the use of the word repeatedly in s. 13(1) suggests that s. 13(1) is aimed not at private communications with friends, but rather at a series of messages that form a larger-scale, public scheme for the dissemination of certain ideas or opinions, designed to gain converts from the public (Schnell, supra, at para. 129).\n[37] The Mission Statement of the Vanguard News Network, which was entered into evidence during the hearing, states that the VNN is a group of disgusted and disaffected writers that have come together in order to reclaim the American mind from the Jews. Thus, it is apparent that the Respondent's communications in that Forum were part of a larger-scale scheme for the dissemination of opinions, designed to gain converts from the public.\n[38] There was a difference of opinion between the Complainant and the witness for the Respondent, Mr. Paul Fromm, as to whether the messages on the VNN Forum were accessible to the public. The Complainant testified that all of the messages could be viewed by the public without being a member of the VNN Forum. Mr. Fromm, on the other hand, testified that some of the messages were not accessible to the public; one had to be a member to view some of the messages.\n[39] Mr. Fromm's testimony in that regard was shaken on cross-examination. During the hearing, and using the Tribunal Registry Officer's computer, the Complainant led Mr. Fromm through the steps involved in accessing a number of postings within a thread from the VNN forum. Mr. Fromm admitted that during this demonstration, he was able to directly access the website with the URL of www.vnnforum.com and several pages within the Forum were viewed without the need to establish membership in the Forum. On the basis of this evidence, I find the Complainant's testimony regarding the public accessibility of the Respondent's postings to be more credible than that of Mr. Fromm. I also accept the Complainant's testimony that the messages on the VNN Forum remained accessible to the public at least until the first day of the hearing, which was August 8, 2005.\n[40] Similarly, the evidence provided above regarding the Northern Alliance Guestbook and the Winnicki website indicates that the Respondent's communications on these websites did not constitute private communications among friends. They were posted for broader consumption and were accessible to the public (until they were shut down) through an Internet search engine or directly by typing the Internet address into a computer.\n[41] Therefore, I find that the Respondent repeatedly communicated all of the impugned messages over the Internet.\nD. Question 4 - Is the material likely to expose persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? (i) The Law [42] In answering this question the Tribunal is guided by the definitions of the words hatred, contempt, expose and likely that have been provided in decisions of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, the Federal Court of Canada and the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[43] In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892, the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the Tribunal's definition of hatred and contempt (Taylor, supra, at para. 60; Nealy v. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450 at p. D\/6469; Taylor and the Western Guard Party v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Attorney General of Canada (1979), T.D. 1\/79 (hereinafter referred to as the Tribunal's decision in Taylor). Hatred is defined as active dislike, detestation, enmity, ill-will and malevolence. It means, in effect, that one finds no redeeming qualities in the object of one's detestation. It is a term, however, which does not necessarily involve the mental process of looking down on another or others. It is quite possible to hate someone who one feels is superior to one in intelligence, wealth, or power.\n[44] Contempt, in contrast, does suggest a mental process of looking down upon or treating as inferior the object of one's feelings. This reflects the dictionary definition of despise, dishonour or disgrace (Taylor, supra, at para. 60)\n[45] Expose means: to leave a person unprotected; to leave without shelter or defence; to lay open to danger, ridicule or censure. (the Tribunal's decision in Taylor, supra, at p. 29). In Taylor, the Tribunal held that expose is a more passive word than incite. This suggests that active effort or intent on the part of the communicator is not envisaged. Similarly, the use of the word expose in s. 13(1) suggests that a violent reaction on the part of the recipient of the message is not envisaged. In other words, the Tribunal stated, if one is creating the right conditions for hatred to flourish, leaving the identifiable group open or vulnerable to ill-feelings or hostility, if one is putting them at risk of being hated, in a situation where hatred or contempt are inevitable, one then falls within the compass of s. 13(1) of the Human Rights Act (p.29).\n[46] The Tribunal in Nealy v. Johnston stated that the use of the word likely in s. 13(1) means that it is not necessary that evidence be adduced to prove that any particular individual or group took the messages seriously and directed hatred or contempt toward others. Nor is it necessary to show that, in fact, anyone was so victimized. Unlike the other sections in the Act dealing with discrimination, s. 13(1) provides for liability where there is no proven or provable discriminatory impact (Nealy v. Johnston, supra, at para. 45697). The Tribunal alluded to the difficulty involved in determining how many people had received the message and to gauging the impact of the message on these people. This, in the Tribunal's view, justified the extension of liability under s. 13(1) to cases where there is no proven or provable actual discriminatory effect.\n[47] The Respondent in this case took issue with the interpretation of s. 13(1) provided by the Tribunal in Nealy v. Johnston, arguing that the majority of the Supreme Court in Taylor did not endorse this interpretation. The Respondent based his argument on statements made by Dickson C.J., on behalf of the majority of the Supreme Court in that case. At paragraph 60, Dickson C.J. stated:\nIn my view, there is no conflict between providing a meaningful interpretation of s. 13(1) and protecting the s. 2(b) freedom of expression so long as the interpretation of the words hatred and contempt is fully informed by an awareness that Parliament's objective is to protect the equality and dignity of all individuals by reducing the incidence of harm-causing expression. (emphasis added)\n[48] The Respondent has interpreted this statement, and others made by the majority in Taylor regarding the importance of focusing on the effects of discrimination, to mean that s. 13(1) requires proof that the impugned material caused harm.\n[49] I disagree with the Respondent's interpretation of the majority's decision in Taylor. Moreover, it does not accord with the wording of s. 13(1) of the Act. Section 13(1) makes it is a discriminatory practice to communicate messages that are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt. The provision does not state that it is a discriminatory practice to communicate messages that cause others to feel hatred or contempt toward members of the targeted group.\n[50] As the majority in Taylor stated, hate messages, by their very nature, do cause harm in two significant ways. First, they undermine the dignity and self-worth of target group members and, secondly, they erode the tolerance and open-mindedness that must flourish in a multi-cultural society that is committed to the idea of equality. The statement was based on numerous studies and Reports that established the harm that is caused by hate messages. (Taylor, supra, at para. 41) There is no suggestion that the majority's conclusion with regard to the harm that is caused by hate messages was limited to the particular facts of the case.\n[51] Therefore, messages that fall within the definition of hate messages in s. 13(1) do cause harm. Proof of harm is not required. The key is to ensure that only those messages that are likely to expose members of the targeted group to unusually strong and deep-felt emotions of detestation, calumny and vilification are caught by s. 13(1).\nThe Likelihood of Exposure to Harm\n[52] How is the likelihood of exposure to hatred or contempt to be determined? Is it sufficient for the Tribunal to have regard to the messages alone and then draw an inference, based on the content, tone and presentation of the messages as to whether they are likely to expose members of the targeted group(s) to hatred or contempt? Or must there be other evidence to assist the Tribunal in determining whether the messages are likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt?\n[53] In Citron v. Zundel, (No. 4) (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/274, at para. 141, the Tribunal stated that, although the expert evidence in that case was helpful, it was the language used in the messages themselves that persuaded the Tribunal that the material offended s. 13(1) of the Act. Similarly, in Warman v. Kyburz, 2003 CHRT 18, the Tribunal noted the expert's evidence that suggested the messages were likely to expose people of the Jewish faith to hatred and contempt, but the Tribunal found that it was evident from the messages themselves that they exposed Jewish people to hatred (Kyburz, supra, at para. 43).\n[54] The Respondent has argued that the likelihood of exposure to hatred and contempt should not be assessed on the basis of the Tribunal's own subjective impressions of the material, nor should it be based on the Tribunal's assessment of the potential impact of the messages on the most malevolent or unthinking person as suggested in Nealy v. Johnston. Rather, the Respondent argued that the assessment should be made on the basis of the likely reaction of the Canadian public.\n[55] The likely reaction of the Canadian public to the impugned messages is determined by comparing the impugned messages to messages of a similar nature that are available on the Internet where the reaction of the Canadian public is known. The Respondent called the latter messages the tolerated messages. I disagree with the term tolerated for the reasons that follow, but for ease of reference, I will continue to use the term the Respondent has given them.\nThe Tolerated Messages\n[56] During the hearing, counsel for the Respondent led evidence that consisted of excerpts from the Bible, the Koran, The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, Mein Kampf by Adolph Hitler, lyrics from contemporary Rap music available on the Internet and other written material that is available online. This material was provided as examples of material that is likely to expose members of a group identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination to hatred or contempt. For example, in The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare describes Shylock, a Jewish money lender, as a dog Jew. In the book of Leviticus in the Bible, homosexuality is described as an abomination and homosexuals as ignorant transgressors that should be put to death. The Rap music that was introduced into evidence describes the white man as the devil and advocates the killing of White people because they are not worthy to walk the earth with the original black man.\n[57] Counsel for the Respondent asserted that these messages were of a comparable nature to the impugned messages. She then stated that uncontradicted evidence showed that the Canadian public has not reacted with hatred or contempt against the targeted groups as a result of these messages which, in the opinion of counsel for the Respondent, are undoubtedly more influential and widely disseminated than the impugned messages. Therefore, counsel for the Respondent asserted, the Canadian public is unlikely to react with hatred and contempt to the impugned messages.\n[58] The uncontradicted evidence would appear to be statements by Respondent counsel, in closing argument, such as the following:\nRegarding sexual orientation, the Catholic Church's vocal opposition of homosexuality is current, well-known, extensive, long term and government subsidized through the church's favorable tax status. Yet, it is also well-known that last year, despite its minority nature, federal Parliament successfully passed law legalizing same sex marriages. Canadian public has shown itself unlikely to be inspired by this message to hold hatred and contempt against homosexuals, its repeated communication notwithstanding.\n[59] Counsel for the Respondent further asserted that the fact that Canada's Governor General, Her Excellency Micha\u00eblle Jean, is a Black woman and that multi-faith weddings occur is further uncontradicted proof that the tolerated messages have not resulted in hatred or contempt being directed at the targeted groups.\n[60] There are a number of flaws in this approach. Firstly, I find no basis for the Respondent's assertion that uncontradicted evidence demonstrates that the Canadian public has not reacted with hatred or contempt as a result of the tolerated messages. The fact that the Governor General of Canada is a Black woman, for example, in no way proves that the tolerated messages that disparage Black people have not caused some people to react with hatred and contempt towards Black people. The fact that there are inter-faith marriages does not prove that messages advocating the annihilation of Jewish people have not caused some people to react with hatred and contempt toward people of the Jewish faith.\n[61] Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, whether or not Canadians have reacted with hatred or contempt to any of the so-called tolerated messages has no bearing whatsoever on my evaluation of the Respondent's messages. As I indicated above, it is not necessary for the Complainant to prove that the Respondent's messages, much less other messages found on the Internet, have caused others to react with hatred or contempt toward the targeted groups. The question is whether the Respondent's messages are likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt.\n[62] If the Respondent's argument is that there is no evidence that the tolerated messages have exposed members of the targeted group to hatred or contempt, again I disagree. The fact that same-sex marriage has been legalized in some jurisdictions in no way demonstrates that the tolerated messages advocating violence against homosexuals are unlikely to expose homosexuals to hatred and contempt. In that regard, I note that the Biblical passage which states that if a man lies with a man he must be put to death, when combined with an anti-gay symbol has been found by the Saskatchewan Board of Inquiry to expose homosexuals to hatred (Hellquist v. Owens (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/197, aff'd, 2002 SKQB 506, on appeal to the Sask. C.A.). Therefore, it cannot be argued that there is no evidence that the tolerated messages have exposed members of the targeted group to hatred or contempt.\n[63] As a culture, we may be exposed, on a frequent basis, to messages that convey hate. However, the likelihood that a message will expose people to hatred and contempt does not diminish because there are numerous others like it circulating in society. The goal of promoting equality of opportunity unhindered by discriminatory practices is not advanced by importing a standard that effectively asks: in comparison to the many messages in society that are likely to expose people to hatred or contempt, are these messages really so bad?\n[64] For these reasons, in determining whether the impugned messages are likely to expose persons to hatred or contempt, I cannot give any weight to the widespread existence of other messages that are alleged to have the same effect. Rather, I must focus on whether it is reasonable to conclude, on the basis of the language, tone, presentation and content of the impugned messages, that they might well have exposed members of the targeted groups to hatred and contempt.\n[65] Moreover, as the majority of the Supreme Court in Taylor stated, as long as the Tribunal continues to sanction only those communications that are likely to expose members of the targeted groups to unusually strong and deep-felt emotions of hatred and contempt, there is little risk that the subjective opinion of the Tribunal will result in the prohibition of merely offensive communications. The Tribunal must also bear in mind that the goal of s. 13(1) is to prohibit hate messages that, by their very nature, create harm. The goal of s. 13(1) is not to rid the Internet of vulgar, distasteful and offensive material.\n(ii) The Impugned Messages The Northern Alliance Guestbook\n[66] In a message on the Northern Alliance Guestbook dated July 12, 2003, the Respondent expressed his disgust for Black people and people of the Jewish faith. He called Black people niggers and described them as intellectually inferior to white people. He stated that he dislikes Blacks in general. The reasons he provided are that Black people are violent and stupid. He stated that Jewish people are responsible for having infested us with the nigger and, therefore, Jewish people should be forced to live with Black people in Israel. He asserted that Jewish people control the media and that is why people like Einstein have received far more acclaim than non-Jewish inventors. The Respondent also expressed his admiration for the Japanese and their culture. He stated that the Japanese are very racially aware and have very strict immigration laws. He stated It will be interesting to see how they handle the Jewish problem.\n[67] In this message, the Respondent attempts to legitimize an attitude of contempt and hatred for people of the Black race by portraying them as intellectually inferior, violent and stupid - in short, devoid of any redeeming qualities. He weaves into this message a theory that blames Jewish people for bringing Black people into White civilization and for taking credit for new inventions. The message fosters the belief that both Black and Jewish people are ruining Canadian society. It is therefore, likely to expose members of these groups to hatred or contempt.\nThe Winnicki Website\n[68] On the website found at WWW3.sympatico.ca\/tom.winnicki, the Complainant found a graphic image or poster that included swastikas, a robot and several other images over which was superimposed the following words:\nWHITE REVOLUTION IS COMING ...... AND IT'S GIGANTIC.\n[69] Then, in smaller letters under the robot image, was the following:\nHOLOHOAX DEBUNKED. FOR UNBIASED HISTORY GO TO: WWW.ihr.org. FOR WHITE NEWS FORGET CNN? GO TO WWW.GOVNN.COM\n[70] Underneath the poster, in capital and bolded letters was the following message:\nWE'RE COMING FOR YOU, YOU JEW FUCKS, YOU AND YOUR SERVILE DOGS TOO.\n[71] This message contains a number of elements that make it likely to expose Jewish people to hatred or contempt. Firstly, it refers to the Holocaust as the Holohoax. This term inspires contempt and ill-will towards Jewish people by suggesting that the mass murder of millions of Jewish people during the Second World War did not happen and was merely a hoax. Secondly, there is a clear threat of harm and ill-will toward Jewish people conveyed in this message. Therefore, I find that the message is likely to expose people of the Jewish faith to hatred or contempt.\nThe Vanguard News Network\nBlack and Other Non-Caucasian People\n[72] The following are examples of some of the Respondent's postings regarding Black and other non-Caucasian people on the VNN Forum.\n[73] In an entry on the VNN Forum entitled Toronto's ghettos move to the `burbs, the Respondent comments on an article in the National Post early in 2004 about the increase in poverty in Toronto. He quotes parts of the article which indicate that the higher poverty neigbourhoods which were previously clustered in the downtown have now become prevalent in suburbs such as North York and Scarborough. The Respondent then states in parentheses:\nWhat those idiots are actually saying is that North York and Scarborough are infested with lazy, savage and totally worthless negroids and other muds of unidentified kind. It took my family less than a year to become productive members of the Canadian society. How long does it take for a 3rd world shit-skin to become a productive member of a white society? That's right, forever. On commie CBC we'll hear about all those Asian tiger entrepreneurs making it big in the promised land - Canada. Of course, commie CBC misses the forest for the few, very few trees. For every one of those shit-skin businessmen, whose businesses are infected with white tax dollars, there are thousands of worthless sub-human scum.\n[74] In another entry in the same thread entitled Toronto's ghettos move to the `burbs, the Respondent comments on a different article regarding affordable housing. He quotes the following from the article: How can this be happening in a city like this? sighed Connie Richards, as she waited for her clothes at the Wash & Fold laundry in Back Creek, a neighbourhood among those identified in the report. The Respondent posted the following reaction to the quote:\n[How? HOW?! Fuck you negroes? Sorry, I should not blame the negroes for their inherent nature. I meant to write Fuck you Jews - nation wreckers, you flooded them here. Hey Connie, fold your filthy negro laundry, pack up your illegitimate (10 or whatever you squeezed out) niglets and get the hell out of our white civilization. I'll even pay for a first-class ticket to Afreaka for you, now about it?]\n[75] There is more of the same kind of commentary that follows this statement.\n[76] In yet another entry on the VNN Forum entitled: Hey Polish girl ... why don't you get a Polish boyfriend on an article about the murder of a woman, the Respondent states:\nPolish women must be total fucking idiots. I've heard so many stories of those whores (not that they're the only ones) dating and screwing with nigs and other muds, it's truly sickening. This race-mixing slut got what she bargained for.\n[77] The Respondent initiated a thread entitled Another brazen daylight shooting in multi-culti Toronto. It contains a number of URL links to news stories. Following the links, the Respondent provides his commentary. He assumed that it was someone of the Black race that committed a shooting in Toronto. These were his words:\nI bet you $1000 it was a nigger or some other assorted type of shit colored man... errr I mean sub-human. Are niggers really such lousy shots? I mean, he was shooting at a car from close range but still managed to hit two passerbys. Stupid nigger-ape. How do you like multi-culturalism Toronto? Good? And Brad Love, a hard working Canadian who saw his city being turned into shit over a few decades is in jail right now for writing perfectly legal (non-threatening that is) anti non-white immigration letters to MPs. I want the Dominion back.\n[78] He then went on to state: Shitskin sexually assaults (a white I presume) woman. He gave a link to another story on a website called pulse 24 and then stated: Shitskins turn everything into shit, everything they touch or come into close vicinity with. He provided yet another URL link and concluded with the following message to Black people:\nMessage to all you coloreds: Get out (if you're already here), stay out and never come back to my city. Don't even come near it, you civilization wrecking muds. Go to multi-culti Toronto. ... better yet, go back to Africa.\n[79] The Respondent also targeted people of East Indian descent stating:\nNIGGERS AND EAST INDIANS ARE SHIT!!!! GET OUT OF OUR CIVILIZATION YOU FUCKING MUDS!!!!\n[80] In the messages quoted above, the Respondent portrayed Black people and other non-White people, especially immigrants, as criminals with sub-average intelligence. He frequently referred to them in terms of human excrement and filth. Black people were described as being worse than violent, thieving, lying bastards. The Respondent called Black people niggers, nigger sub-humans, fucking subhuman, fucking mud, fucking cockroach, a.k.a. fucking coon, a.k.a. fucking nigger. These kinds of descriptions and epithets are de-humanizing, degrading and highly likely to expose Black people and other non-White or non-Caucasian people to hatred and contempt.\n[81] The clear message throughout all of the Respondent's communications regarding Black people, East Indian people and other non-Caucasian people is that they are such detestable, violent and stupid human beings that they must be removed from Canada or segregated from the pure White population. They have no redeeming qualities and are so dangerous and harmful that extreme hatred is justified.\n[82] I find that Respondent was not merely venting his emotions; he was also imploring visitors to the website to see things his way. He was seeking converts to his point of view. This is evidenced by the fact that he signed all of his posting with the words: COME WITH US, I SEE PASSION IN YOUR EYES. The Respondent's use of newspaper articles as evidence supporting his statements lends a certain appearance of legitimacy and an air of social commentary to his messages. In my view, it is likely that some will find these messages persuasive. I find that the content and manner in which the messages regarding Black people and other non-Caucasian races created a likelihood that members of these groups will be exposed to hatred and contempt.\n[83] One of the Respondent's most disturbing postings is found within a thread entitled Topeka May 15th Demonstration - Be There? on the Vanguard News Network. According to the Complainant's testimony, the participants in this discussion forum were discussing a counter demonstration in the United States to show their disapproval of the celebration of the anniversary of the United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Topeka Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). That decision resulted in the desegregation of American schools.\n[84] In the posting beside the Respondent's pseudonym Thexder 3D, the Respondent described how he was denied entry to the United States to attend the counter-demonstration in Topeka. At the end of his description, the Respondent made an impassioned plea to the forum readers to print his sign, which he attached to his posting, and hold it up high for the world to see at the rally. He stated: I would love to see the faces on those Negroes and the Mud when they see my sign on TV.\n[85] The sign that was attached to the Respondent's posting consisted of a collage of four photographs with text superimposed over the photographs and then a second page of text. Three of the four photographs on the first page show the picture of a dead Black man from different angles. In each of the three pictures it appears that the man's brains are oozing from his smashed skull. The internal parts of his neck are also distended from a gash in his neck area. The fourth photograph shows a live Black man smiling and supporting the head of what appears to be a dead or unconscious Black man (perhaps the same man as the one in the other three photographs).\n[86] Superimposed over the photograph of the live Black man supporting the head of the dead or unconscious Black man (to the side of the image) are the words: Proudly Celebwating Afwikan Kultcha, at www.govnn.com. Then in the bottom left hand corner are the words Monrovia, Liberia. Around the perimeter of this collage of four photographs, one reads the following:\nJEWS PRODUCED ZIMBABWE DO YOU WANT AFRICA HERE? THINK WHITE MAN, WHITE WOMAN, IT DOESN'T HURT.\n[87] The second page of the attachment reads as follows:\nSTOP THE GENOCIDE OF THE WHITE CREATOR RACE! FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION FOR WHITES!'\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON: TWO RACES, 'EQUALLY FREE, CANNOT LIVE IN THE SAME GOVERNMENT.\nCIVILIZATION IS A FUNCTION OF RACE.\nPROOF: HAITI vs ICELAND.\nLim [IQ (COLOR)] = 0\ncolor - black\nFORCED INTEGRATION IS MURDER OF WHITE CHILDREN!\nDID BLACKS RUIN YOUR SCHOOL YET?\nYOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD? YOUR CITY?\nYOUR STATE? YOUR COUNTRY?\nWHITE EUROPEAN CREATOR RACE MUST SURVIVE!\n[88] This would all appear to be part of the sign that the Respondent wanted the readers of his message to download and take to the demonstration in Topeka.\n[89] On a second occasion, the Respondent made use of photographic imagery to convey his message of hatred. In a posting he made within a thread entitled Chopping hands off, stoning, throwing kids from an overpass onto a busy highway, the Respondent asked his readers: What's next Toronto, this? He then posted a picture of a group of Black people, some holding the legs of an obviously dead Black man or boy whose body looked charred. The words that were superimposed above the photograph read: In Africa, this lynch mob lit this person on fire and dragged him through the streets, but not before beating him senseless. This horrifying image and invitation to contemplate whether this could happen in Toronto is followed by the Respondent's signature line: COME WITH US, I SEE PASSION IN YOUR EYES.\n[90] In a sea of words, pictures act as an irresistible lure to draw people in. Pictures also convey and distort meaning in very powerful ways. While there are undoubtedly some people that would find the imagery in the Respondent's material to be so nauseating they would immediately turn away, still others would be like highway motorists slowing down to see if anyone was bleeding at the roadside accident. The messages, which were superimposed over the photographs, would have a more powerful effect, in my view, when coupled with the strong feelings that are naturally aroused by seeing burnt and disemboweled bodies. They convey the impression that committing atrocities against other human beings is normal African culture or behaviour and suggest that these events could happen in Canada. The message is clearly that Blacks are a dangerous, murderous menace and worthy of nothing but the deepest feelings of disgust and loathing. Moreover, I find that the use of photographic imagery with incendiary words superimposed over them adds extra virulence to the hatred and contempt to which Black people would likely be exposed as a result of the messages.\n[91] For these reasons, I find that the messages on the VNN forum which were submitted in evidence during the hearing dealing with Black and other non-Caucasian races, and persons of African origin are likely to expose members of these groups to hatred or contempt.\nPeople of the Jewish Faith\n[92] The Respondent describes Jewish people in the most vulgar and hostile of terms. His basic theme is that Jewish people are a foul and evil people bent on destroying White European civilization. His messages exhort White Canadians to adopt his belief that Jewish people control the media and government and have invented or exaggerated the Holocaust in order to extort money from governments and institutions around the world. For example, in one posting, the Respondent takes issue with a statement by a member of a national Jewish organization regarding s. 319 of the Criminal Code, which deals with hate crimes. After stating that Jewish people are an alien race totally lacking in values, the Respondent asks a series of questions that are clearly designed to elicit the response that Jewish people are trying to manipulate Canadian laws. The Respondent asks:\nWhat do you think White Canadian? Should Jews be allowed to have any say or any influence whatsoever, direct or indirect, in forming laws in our Dominion? Ever hear None is too many? Do you know who said it? Do you know why? Do you know that Jews have been expelled, en masse, pretty much from every European nation at one time or another? From some even more than once. Why do you think that is? Do you think we should be passing laws to grant more freedoms to citizens or take freedoms away? What are Jews attempting to do? Why, why, why, damit ... why?\nWhile I still can ...\nFUCK YOU JEWS!\nYOU FUCKING HEEBES\nYOU FUCKING KIKES\nYOU FUCKING YIDS\nYOU FUCKING ZHIDS\nYOU FUCKING SHEENIES\nYOU FUCKING (what's the best word for Jews?) JEWS!!!\n[Damn it! I want bigger fonts! \u2639]\n[93] In my view, the reason that the message above is likely to expose people of the Jewish faith to hatred and contempt lies not just in the abusive language that is used toward Jewish people, but also because it is highly likely to foster the idea that Jewish people are creating laws like s. 319 of the Criminal Code in order ruin the world for white Canadians. It creates the impression that if Jewish people are a dangerous menace to society.\n[94] In another posting, the Respondent provides his views that the Jewish Holocaust was a Jewish Holohoax designed to extort trillions of dollars from countries like Germany. He states:\nAnd what was all that crap I've heard about lampshades and soap in my high school history class? I'm still looking for detailed information on how the genial Germans turned a Jew into a bar of soap. They were, and still are, very creative people, so if there was a way I'm sure they would have found it. If they have indeed turned corpses of dead Jews into soap, I'd like evidence as to how they did it.\n[95] The trivialization and denial of the Holocaust is likely to provoke many reactions in people. For those who have lived through the Holocaust, it may lead to feelings of rage and despair that an experience that they lived through is being denied. In others, the allegation that the Holocaust is a hoax may well lead them to feel extreme anger that the world has been duped and robbed by Jewish people. This in turn leads to hatred and other feelings of deep resentment toward people of the Jewish faith.\n[96] The Respondent also used photographs to convey his hatred for Jewish people. For example, in his posting to the VNN website, he posted the picture of four girls over which he superimposed the words in large letters:\nJews hate European beauty and nobility. All these girls were brutally murdered by savage commie Jews. We are coming for you, you Jew bastards, and there will be hell to pay.\nMURDERED BY JEWS.\n[97] The innocence and beauty of the picture of the four girls is powerfully contrasted to the savage allegation of murder. There is little that incites violent hatred more than allegations of the brutal murder of innocent children. This is essentially a poster advocating revenge against Jewish people.\n[98] Indeed, in one of his postings, in which the Respondent was expressing his rage about a statement that foreign workers are taking American jobs, he stated:\nWhen does the blood-bath begin? I'm reasonably well off, steady full-time job, not much expenditures, all bills paid on time without much hassle, however, I feel for all those white Americans, Canadians and Europeans who are loosing their life at the behest of the ZOG. I wouldn't mind one single bit if the Holy Racial War started tomorrow. (emphasis added)\n[99] The Complainant testified that within the neo-Nazi movement the expression, as it is commonly known Racial Holy War (sometimes shortened to Rahowa), refers to an apocalyptic race war. It is believed that, at some point in the future, all Whites will be forced to slaughter all of the other races in order to maintain what is perceived to be their supremacy. ZOG is the acronym for Zionist order government, which refers to the theory that Jewish people control the governments in all countries of the world.\n[100] In the posting above, the Respondent was clearly laying the blame for unemployment at the feet of Jewish people and suggesting that the slaughter of all non-Caucasian people would be the appropriate response. The inference that Jewish people are responsible for unemployment and poverty, in my view, is likely to expose them to extreme ill will that could well manifest itself in violent action.\nConclusion: The Messages Constitute Hate Messages\n[101] I find that the messages in the Northern Alliance Guestbook, the Winnicki website and the VNN website and forum are likely to expose people of the Jewish faith, Black race and other non-Caucasian races, and persons of African origin to hatred and contempt. I base this conclusion on the following findings: the messages portray members of the target groups as sub-human filth that are worthy of nothing but the highest degree of contempt and hatred; they convey the idea that members of the targeted groups are dangerous, evil and a menace to White Canadians; they express virulent hatred toward members of the targeted groups in abusive and threatening terms; they exhort others to adopt the same position as the Respondent; and, they seek to justify, motivate and legitimize violent action against members of the targeted groups. The result is that the targeted groups are highly vulnerable to hatred, contempt and even violence as a result of the messages.\n[102] The Respondent argued that the messages were not likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred and contempt since anyone surfing the Internet would have fair warning of the content of the messages by the nature of the banners on the frames of the VNN. The banners of the VNN announce: White Revolution Panzerfaust Records and sometimes: Radio White Now Playing HateMonger - The Battle is not Over off of HateMonger. Therefore, according to the Respondent, people would have a choice whether to read the messages or not.\n[103] The same choice was available to people who called in to the telephone message service in the Taylor case to receive the messages that were found in that case to violate s. 13(1) of the Act. The Tribunal held that it was of no consequence that people accessed the message voluntarily, knowing what to expect. This did not affect the fact that the messages were likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt. In the same way, I find the fact that the banners provided some vague indication of the content of the website does not put the messages beyond the reach of s. 13(1). Whether some stumbled unintentionally upon the messages or others actively sought them out, there is, in my view, a strong likelihood that the messages would expose members of the targeted groups to extreme hatred and contempt.\n[104] Therefore, I find that, in repeatedly communicating, by means of the Internet, the messages that were entered into evidence at the hearing in this matter, the Respondent violated s. 13(1) of the Act.\nThe Messages Where the Complainant is Named Personally\n[105] The Commission introduced eight messages into evidence where the Complainant was named personally. The Complainant was described as a Jew, a suspected Jew, a vile, acidic Jew and the suggestion was made that his motivation in filing human rights complaints was to seek money like all Jews. It was argued that, in the context of the Respondent's other messages that were likely to expose Jewish people to hatred or contempt, the identification of the Complainant as a Jewish person exposed him to the same hatred or contempt.\n[106] The messages in which the Complainant is named personally are as follows:\n(1) The first message was communicated on the VNN forum within a thread, or topic of discussion, entitled Anti-Semitism's Hateful Resurgence. The Complainant testified that this thread was started on January 17, 2004. The Respondent stated:\n... Jews become increasingly insane each day trying to figure out how to censor the Internet. I myself already have been a victim of this when Bell Sympatico gave in to Jewish pressure, courtesy of Jew Richard Warman who works for the Canadian (kill the white men) Human Rights Commission. The fuckers didn't just delete the `offending' page (even after I changed the forbidden word Jews to Zionists) but also deleted all my programming and all my 3D art as well. As long as Jewish lies continue to fly, Jews will continue to reap billions and billions of dollars in extortion-reparations, so it's very important to the Jews to censor our Internet, sites such as the Zundelsite, VNN and others, but alas...TOO LATE YOU STUPID FUCKING JEWS, YOU (ADL, SPLC JDL, CJC et. al.) FUCKED UP! [This felt good.] Now it's just a matter of time. I praise those nerds who invented the Internet. I'm willing to bet money on it that exposing Jews was one of their objectives.\n(2) In another message communicated on March 13, 2004 on the VNN Forum within a thread entitled Americans are not humans, the Respondent stated:\nI myself have fallen under the Jew radar when a vile, acidic Jew - Richard Warman (he says he's NOT a Jew) launched a complaint against me to the CHRC [Canadian Human (read 'Kill the White Men') Rights Commission]. It was mostly because of some comments I made on the Northern Alliance's, now defunct, guestbook and a picture of Tsar's daughters that I (and others) circulated around the net. Maybe you've seen it, it was posted on VNN once.\n(3) On August 23, 2004, the Respondent communicated a message on the VNN Forum entitled: My reply to Randy Richmond's article. In this message, the Respondent referred to an article in the London Free Press written by Randy Richmond dated August 18, 2004. The London Free Press article described the fact that the police had launched a criminal investigation into the Respondent's activities. It provided quotes from a number of sources, including the Complainant, conveying their opinions about the impugned messages.\nIn response to this newspaper article, the Respondent asked:\nWhy am I threatened with the police, 4 anti-white European organizations (ironically funded by White Europeans) and possibly Jewish lawyer for doing so? Why aren't the police doing their job protecting our White European society and shipping out negroes back to their natural habitat ... Africa?\nAgain on August 24, 2004, the Respondent wrote:\nDoes Warman = Jewman? Why doesn't Warman go to Israel and speak out against the Israeli's racism and horrific oppression of the poor Palestinian peoples?\n(4) Later, on August 24, 2004, in another message within the same thread the Respondent stated: I suspect Warman is a JEW. The word JEW is written in capital letters and is then repeated 117 times with the final JEW in enlarged, bolded capital letters followed by three exclamation marks.\nThe comment then continued with the following:\nOh, by the way. Thanks to Warman, Bell has canceled my email account, which was very important to me at the time since I was trying to sell a piece of software I wrote.\n(5) In a message communicated on September 9, 2004, the Respondent commented on another human rights case involving the Complainant which dealt with allegations of hate messaging contrary to s. 13(1) of the Act. In that case, like the present case, the Complainant sought damages for being personally targeted. The thread is entitled JOG goes after Webhosting ISP's. The Respondent stated:\nNote, those worthless fucking lawyers want $80,000 in...'reparations'. OY VEY!!! OY PAY!!! How very, very JOO-ISH, demanding free money. I suspect most of it would go to Mr. Vermin, whom I suspect to be a JEW. That's what he does people. The scumbag surfs around on the Internet, looking for any remotely pro-White European site and if he finds anything remotely `offensive' to our privileged minorities in Canada, he files a complaint to the CHRC (Canadian Human Rights Commission - hates white people). When the case goes to a tribunal he hopes the accused will give up. After that he takes them to the small claims court and sues them for like $9999.99, just below the $10,000 mark so it's still under the small claims court jurisdiction (if I'm not mistaken, the mark may be set to $5000, in which case he'd sue them for $4999.99). When he wins, he gets the money, and that's how he makes his living, so I suspect. Probably gets tons of handouts from his JOO-ISH buddies in CJC (Canadian Jewish Congress) who get millions of free dollars, care of the Canadian ZOG, financed by the White Canadian taxpayer. Some civilization builders those JOOZ, eh? Always trying to get something for nothing. $6 billion from the Swiss banks, $6 trillion from the U.S. government, $6 trillion from the German government, $6,000 from a local 'white hater'. Good business ITZ, no?\n(6) On September 11, 2004, the Respondent started a thread entitled Suspected JEW Richard Warman attacks Whites in Canada ... again. This thread referred to human rights complaints that had been filed by the Complainant against other individuals. Following the heading, the Respondent re-posted material from a third party that referred to the Complainant as a professional campaigner against free speech and a censor.\n(7) On October 29, 2004, the Respondent initiated a thread with the following: Richard Warman is at it again. FUCK YOU THOUGHT POLICE.\n(8) In May 2005, the Respondent communicated a number of messages within a thread that was entitled Jews and anti-White European haters launch a new assault on a White Freedom Fighter. Most of the Respondent's messages in that thread related to an open letter that was drafted and publicly released by a number of groups and individuals such as the Complainant, calling for police and government action against the Respondent. In one of the messages within that thread, the Respondent provided a list of what purported to be recent human rights complaints against what he called Nationalist and pro-White activists in Canada. The complaint against the Respondent that gave rise to these proceedings was first on that list.\n[107] In yet another message within that thread, the Respondent wrote a heading in large, block, bold letters: MY ENEMIES. After this heading, the Respondent posted photographs of three individuals, one of whom was the Complainant. On each of the foreheads of the three photographed individuals, a Star of David was superimposed. Then, at the base of the pictures, are the captions: Most likely a Jew, Possible Jew and Honorary Jew. The Complainant is described as Possible Jew.\n[108] In all but one of the above messages, the Complainant is portrayed as a vile, acidic Jew, suspected Jew, Mr. Vermin or simply a Jew and the allegation is made that, like other Jews (according to the Respondent) the Complainant is extorting money from White Canadians and suppressing free speech.\n[109] The Complainant testified that he is not, in fact, Jewish. However, I agree with other members of this Tribunal that it does not matter whether Mr. Warman was in fact Jewish or not. A person who is perceived to have the characteristics of someone who falls within one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination may be the object of discrimination, even though he does not actually have those characteristics (School District No. 44 (North Vancouver) v. Jubran, 2005 BCCA 201 at para. 41, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused; see also Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montreal (City), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665). Taken in this context, the Complainant was, in my view, identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[110] The tone of the messages is extremely hostile and threatening. The messages convey the clear impression that the Complainant, as a perceived member of the Jewish faith, is a contemptible human being worthy of nothing more than the deepest hatred. The allegation that the Complainant's activities are part of a larger international Jewish conspiracy to extort money from non-Jewish people is likely, in my view, to expose the Complainant, as well as members of the Jewish faith, to deep feelings of anger, resentment and hatred.\n[111] Therefore, I find that the messages in which the Complainant is named personally violate s. 13(1) of the Act.\nE. Question 5 - Did the Respondent Retaliate or Threaten Retaliation Against the Complainant? [112] Section 14.1 of the Act makes it a discriminatory practice to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the alleged victim of a discriminatory practice or the person who has filed a human rights complaint. This provision in the Act is important because, without it, many would be hesitant to complain about discrimination for fear of reprisal. It provides complainants and alleged victims of discrimination with the assurance that, if action is taken or threats are made against them as a result of the filing of the complaint, redress will be provided. Section 14.1 may also act as a deterrent to those who would take action or threaten action against someone who has filed a complaint either to punish the complainant or to coerce the complainant to withdraw the complaint.\n[113] What kind of conduct constitutes retaliation or threats of retaliation within the meaning of s. 14.1? The following are examples of some of the conduct that this Tribunal has found to violate s. 14.1:\n[114] sending a letter to the complainant's employer in an effort to have the complainant fired from his employment (Kyburz, supra, at para. 73);\nthreatening the complainant's life (Kyburz, supra, at para. 74); threatening to ruin the complainant's career and life (Kyburz, supra, at para. 75); refusing to renew a work contract (In Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service) [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 1) at para. 233, the Tribunal found that this action constituted retaliation but held that the actions predated the entry into force of the retaliation provisions); publishing derogatory remarks about the Complainant (Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council 2004 CHRT 40 at para. 58) revoking the complainant's position on an Annual General Assembly (Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council 2004 CHRT 40 at para. 60)\n[115] Is it necessary to prove that the Respondent intended to cause the Complainant or the victim harm in order to prove retaliation? Some members of this Tribunal are of the view that proof of intent is necessary in retaliation complaints. (see, for example: Roger Virk v. Bell Canada (Ontario) 2005 CHRT 2 at para. 156). Other members have held that, if a complainant reasonably perceived the impugned conduct to be in retaliation for the laying of a human rights complaint, this could amount to retaliation quite apart from any proven intention of the Respondent (see, for example: Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 11 (Q.L.) at para. 222; Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, supra, at para.) However, the reasonableness of the complainant's perception must be measured. Respondents should not be held accountable for any unreasonable anxiety or undue reaction of complainants.\n[116] I am inclined to follow the line of reasoning in Wong and Bressette. In my view, it is in keeping with the Supreme Court's statement in Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84, that the Act is remedial in nature, not punitive, and that therefore, the motives or intention of those who discriminate are not central to the concerns of the Act.\n[117] In the present case, the Commission argued that the same eight messages in which the Respondent named the Complainant, and which were found to be violations of s. 13(1), also violate s. 14.1 of the Act. While it is possible that the same conduct will be found to have violated more than one provision of the Act, the question then arises as to whether, in the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to provide compensation twice for the same conduct. I will address that issue later in the Remedies section of my decision.\n[118] The question at this stage of the analysis is whether the Complainant reasonably perceived that the impugned messages were retaliatory or were threats of retaliation for filing a human rights complaint against the Respondent.\n[119] As has been noted, the messages described the Complainant in highly derogatory terms. In all but one of the above-noted postings, the Complainant is referred to as a Jew, a vile acidic Jew, or a suspected Jew. I find that the messages were very threatening. The last message in which a Star of David is superimposed over a photograph of the Complainant is particularly disturbing. It looks decidedly like a target mark.\n[120] The Complainant testified that he was so alarmed about the last posting that he contacted the police to determine whether charges of uttering threats could be laid against the Respondent. He also consulted with a lawyer about the possibility of seeking a peace bond against the Respondent. In the context of the Respondent's other messages encouraging the annihilation of the Jewish people, I find that the messages could reasonably be perceived as retaliation or threats of retaliation.\n[121] The question is whether the messages were posted in retaliation for the filing of the human rights complaint against the Respondent.\n[122] The evidence disclosed that there was a history of animosity between the Complainant and the Respondent. It was clear from the evidence that the Complainant took a number of actions against the Respondent in an effort to stop the latter from using the Internet to communicate hate messages. In August and September of 2003, the Complainant complained to the Respondent's internet service provider about the Respondent's website. The Respondent's website was subsequently shut down.\n[123] On September 7, 2003, the Complainant filed a human rights complaint against the Respondent. After filing the human rights complaint, the Complainant testified that he took further action against the Respondent including: complaining to the London Police about the Respondent's Internet messages, participating with a number of other organizations in an open letter calling for action against the Respondent, providing information to a London Free Press reporter about the Respondent and giving a speech at a conference in Toronto that included a discussion about the Respondent's case.\n[124] The Respondent was clearly angry with the Complainant for taking these actions against him and other white nationalists. He communicated his anger through the series of messages on the VNN Forum that were listed above. All of the postings post-date the filing of the human rights complaint. However, not all of the messages make mention of the human rights complaint against the Respondent.\n[125] In Bressette, the Tribunal stated that when there has been a history of conflict between the complainant and the respondent it can be difficult to discern whether certain incidents arose simply as a result of the ongoing conflict, or whether they were linked to the human rights complaint (Bressette, supra, at para. 52). The Tribunal adopted an approach in that case which I think is appropriate in the present case.\n[126] The Tribunal member in Bressette first determined whether he could accept, on a prima facie basis, that the human rights complaint was at least one of the factors influencing the differential treatment that the Complainant received. After he found that he could, the onus then shifted to the Respondent to provide a credible explanation for the treatment.\n[127] Although not all of the messages made reference to the Complainant's human rights complaint against the Respondent, I think that it is a reasonable perception that the filing of the complaint was at least one of the factors influencing the Respondent's conduct towards the Complainant. The postings were all made after the filing of the human rights complaint. At least three of the postings specifically mention the human rights complaint against the Respondent or the Complainant's use of the human rights process to extort money from people like him.\n[128] Clearly there were other actions taken by the Complainant which angered the Respondent and may have played a role in the Respondent's communication of threatening messages about the Complainant. However, the Respondent, who chose not to testify, provided no evidence whatsoever that would rule out a finding that the filing of the human rights complaint against the Respondent was at least one of the factors influencing the posting of the messages.\nConclusion Regarding Retaliation\n[129] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the above-noted messages constitute retaliation or threats of retaliation against the Complainant for the filing of a human rights complaint, contrary to s. 14.1 of the Act.\nIV. REMEDIES [130] Counsel for the Respondent raised several general arguments with respect to remedies that merit some discussion. First, counsel argued that compensation and a penalty would be inappropriate in this case since the only remedy that was subjected to constitutional scrutiny by the Supreme Court in Taylor was the cease and desist order. Therefore, any other remedy is constitutionally uncertain. This argument ignores the fact that in Schnell, the Tribunal held that the penalty and special compensation provisions that were provided in the post-Taylor amendments to the Act did not push s. 13(1) over the line into unconstitutionality. Furthermore, for reasons that I will provide in the section dealing with the penalty provisions under s. 54(1)(c), I am of the view that the Tribunal cannot refuse to apply the law out of a fear of constitutional uncertainty.\n[131] The Respondent's second argument is that the Complainant's conduct militates against an award of compensation or a penalty. Specifically, counsel argued that there was evidence that the Complainant not only encouraged the Respondent to violate the Act, but also that he participated in the violation of the Act and in the violation of the Federal Court injunction order. Counsel further alleged that the Complainant engaged in violent and criminal activities. She argued that any order against the Respondent would effectively condone the Complainant's conduct in that regard and, therefore, should not be made.\n[132] The Respondent is free to pursue any claims he might have with regard to the Complainant's conduct in the appropriate venue. However, my consideration of the evidence is limited to a determination of whether this evidence affects the Complainant's credibility regarding the pain and suffering he experienced as a result of the retaliatory messages. Beyond this issue, the evidence has no relevance.\n[133] Although it is customary to address the remedies for breaches of the hate message provision before the retaliation component, I have decided to reverse that order for reasons of logical consistency, which will become apparent later in this decision.\nA. Retaliation - Section 14.1 [134] Section 14.1 provides that it is a discriminatory practice to retaliate against a person who has filed a human rights complaint. Section 53 authorizes the Tribunal to make certain orders against a person found to be engaging or to have engaged in a discriminatory practice. Section 53(2) provides a wide range of potential orders that may be made.\n[135] In the present case, the Commission and the Complainant have requested the following orders:\nAn order that the Respondent cease and desist from retaliating against the Complainant for having filed a human rights complaint against him; An order that the Respondent provide the Complainant $20,000 in compensation for pain and suffering; An order that the Respondent provide the Complainant with special compensation in the amount of $20,000; An order that the Respondent compensate the Complainant for his expenses related to the hearing which were not otherwise covered by the Commission.\n(i) Cease and Desist Order [136] The Respondent argued that a cease and desist order would send the wrong message to the Respondent. It would communicate to him the idea that disagreeable thoughts are not permitted in Canadian society. This is not true. Disagreeable public messages are permissible as long as they do not violate the law. In this case, the Respondent violated s. 14.1 of the Act by retaliating or threatening retaliation against the Complainant by means of Internet communications. The evidence indicates that he was doing so right up until the hearing in this matter began. Illegal conduct of this nature must not be permitted to continue.\n[137] Therefore, pursuant to s. 53(2)(a) of the Act, the Respondent is ordered to cease and desist from retaliating against the Complainant for having filed his human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. This order covers retaliatory conduct including, but not limited to Internet postings, whether on the VNN forum or elsewhere on the Internet, that is similar to the material that was entered into evidence during the hearing into this matter. The Respondent is directed to cease his retaliatory activity immediately upon becoming aware of the Tribunal's decision.\n(ii) Compensation for Pain and Suffering [138] Section 53(2)(e) allows the Tribunal to order that the Respondent compensate the victim in an amount not exceeding $20,000 for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[139] The Complainant testified that, in the context of the Respondent's stated desire to see the world rid of Jewish people and knowing what he knows about the Second World War, he was alarmed by the repeated references to him as a Jew. He was alarmed because the postings were going to a fairly large neo-Nazi forum. He stated that there was an extensive history of violence within the neo-Nazi movement and, therefore, he feared he would be made a target of violent attack.\n[140] This fear increased when he saw the picture of himself with the Star of David superimposed over his forehead. The Complainant testified that the location of the Star of David on his forehead gave him the impression that a target mark had been placed on his forehead. As a result, he contacted the police to determine whether charges of uttering threats could be laid against the Respondent. He also consulted with a lawyer about the possibility of seeking a peace bond against the Respondent.\n[141] The Complainant claims to have been so alarmed and frightened that compensation in the amount of $20,000 would be appropriate. This is the maximum allowed under section 53(2)(e) of the Act.\n[142] Counsel for the Respondent argued that the Complainant was not to be believed when he testified that he experienced pain and suffering as a result of the retaliatory messages. Respondent Counsel tendered evidence that, she claimed, discredited the Complainant's testimony in that regard.\n[143] Counsel also argued that the evidence indicated that the Complainant's conduct with regard to this matter was so reprehensible that an award for pain and suffering would be inappropriate. This argument, however, runs counter to the statements made by the Federal Court in Pitawanakwat v. Canada (A.G.) [1994] 3 F.C. 298. There the Court said that to deny an award for hurt feelings on the basis of the conduct of the complainant is, in effect, to condone discrimination on the basis of a prohibited ground where the conduct of the complainant is, for whatever reason, less than exemplary.\n[144] Thus, my consideration of the following evidence is strictly limited to its impact on the credibility of the Complainant's claim to have experienced pain and suffering.\nEvidence Regarding the Extent of the Complainant's Pain and Suffering\n[145] The evidence regarding the Complainant's credibility consisted of: a Statement of Claim by the Complainant against Mr. Paul Fromm for libel, two video tapes about the Complainant's alleged involvement in violent activities, speaking notes from a speech that the Complainant gave to the ARA annual meeting; newspaper articles about the Complainant written by Mr. Randy Richmond and published in the London Free Press, and postings made by the Complainant on the VNN Forum.\n[146] I permitted the evidence to be admitted on the basis that it was relevant to the question of whether the Complainant had experienced pain and suffering as a result of the alleged retaliation against him by the Respondent. However, I reserved my decision as to what weight I would give the evidence until after I had heard the entire case and was rendering my decision.\nThe libel suit and the London Free Press Article by Randy Richmond\n[147] The Respondent tendered a Statement of Claim filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice indicating that the Complainant was suing Mr. Paul Fromm for statements the latter made that were allegedly libelous and slanderous. The Respondent also produced a newspaper article from the London Free Press dated March 31, 2005, in which some of the same statements that were said to be libelous in the law suit were reproduced. Specifically, Mr. Fromm is alleged to have called the Complainant, among other things, the high priest of censorship. This label was reproduced in Mr. Richmond's Free Press article. The Complainant admitted that he provided Mr. Richmond with some of the quotes that were used in the article.\n[148] It was argued that this evidence demonstrated that the Complainant is not to be believed when he says that he has suffered because, on the one hand, he sued Mr. Fromm for statements that Mr. Fromm allegedly made about him and, on the other hand, he offered these same statements to Mr. Richmond and did not complain when these statements were reproduced in the London Free Press article.\n[149] I accord little weight to this evidence. Firstly, the evidence does not prove that the Complainant did not suffer any pain and suffering as a result of the allegedly libelous remarks. Secondly, the allegedly libelous statements are different from the allegedly retaliatory messages in this case. Thus, it would not be reasonable for me to draw inferences about the Complainant's reaction to the retaliatory messages in the present context based on the allegedly libelous statements in the other case.\n[150] The Complainant's Speaking Notes For a Speech entitled Maximum Disruption: Stopping Neo-Nazis By (Almost) Any Means Necessary and a Video of CBC coverage of the Zundel Demonstration\n[151] A copy of speaking notes from a presentation that the Complainant gave on July 6, 2005 to the annual meeting of a group known as Anti-Racist Action (ARA) was entered into evidence. The speech was entitled: Maximum Disruption: Stopping Neo-Nazis By (Almost) Any Means Necessary. The Complainant testified that he is not a member of the ARA. He testified that he was invited by the group to give the speech and that it was similar to ones he had given at other events.\n[152] In his speech, the Complainant testified that he presented what he called a broad front approach to dealing with Neo-Nazi activity in Canada. This approach involved working with the police, the Canadian Human Rights Commission and other organizations to create maximum disruption within what he perceives to be the Neo-Nazi movement in Canada. The Complainant analyzed three different cases in which he was involved, and showed how the broad front approach played out in those cases.\n[153] The Complainant's notes indicate that he uses the maximum disruption approach when it is most helpful or even if he just feels it will be the most fun. In his notes, he also stated that if he found someone particularly annoying he would move them up the list a bit.\n[154] In cross-examination, the Complainant testified that when he stated, during his speech, that he derived fun from the maximum disruption approach and that he moved people up the list when he found them annoying, he was attempting to be humorous. He testified that, like anyone, he took some pleasure in doing meaningful work, but that the work to stop White nationalists from spreading hate on the Internet had caused considerable hardship to himself and to his family.\n[155] One of the three cases that the Complainant discussed during his speech was that of the Respondent. Another was the case of Ernst Zundel. In the context of his discussion on the Zundel case, the Complainant expressed his disapproval of serious incidents that had occurred when mail bombs were sent to Mr. Zundel and his bunker was severely damaged by an arsonist.\n[156] The Complainant testified that he had intended to show a photograph of the Respondent during the speech. However, the equipment needed to project the photograph was not available and, therefore, the picture was not shown.\n[157] During the hearing, I viewed a video from a CBC program of a physical confrontation that occurred between members of the ARA and pro-Zundel supporters during a demonstration in support of Mr. Zundel in September, 2004. In his speech to the ARA, the Complainant noted that the Respondent had been part of the Zundel demonstration and that the Respondent had been charged with a criminal offense when weapons were found in his car on this occasion. The Complainant stated, in his speech: The demonstration they were headed for, of course, was one where Anti-Racist Action Toronto was going to be attending to ensure that public support for one of the world's worst Holocaust-deniers would not go unopposed.\n[158] I was invited to conclude that these comments signaled the Complainant's tacit approval of the violence that erupted at the Zundel demonstration. I see no basis for this conclusion. The Complainant makes no mention whatsoever of the physical confrontation between the two groups in his speech. The fact that he did not mention the confrontation does not, in my mind, signal his approval for the violence that occurred after the demonstration. Moreover, in my view, whether the Complainant approved of the ARA's tactics and its alleged tendency toward violence is not relevant to the question of whether the Complainant experienced pain and suffering as a result of the retaliatory messages.\n[159] I find, however, that the Complainant's speaking notes do suggest a certain robustness of spirit and even an enjoyment of the thrust and parry of the battle. His ability to derive pleasure out of his maximum disruption approach and to use it to deal with people he finds annoying, suggests a degree of imperviousness to the pain and suffering that some victims might experience as a result of retaliation.\n[160] I also find it significant that the Complainant would be prepared to display a photograph of the Respondent to members of the ARA and call him a nasty piece of work only a few months after the Respondent had posted a picture of the Complainant on the Internet. The nature and tone of this reaction suggests a resiliency that is not consistent with a claim to have suffered greatly as a result of the Respondent's retaliatory messages.\n[161] I find, however, that the video about the confrontation between members of the ARA and pro-Zundel supporters deserves minimal weight. The confrontation did not involve the Complainant and, as I stated above, I find no indication in the evidence that the Complainant condoned the violence that occurred there. I stand by my ruling during the hearing that the violent or non-violent nature of the ARA was not relevant to the inquiry.\nThe David Icke Video\n[162] During the hearing, a video was tendered regarding the Complainant's involvement in action taken against an individual by the name of David Icke, who was in Vancouver on a speaking tour a number of years ago. Mr. Icke, who wrote a book involving a conspiracy theory, was apparently considered by some to be a proponent of anti-Semitism.\n[163] Most of the video deals with Mr. Icke's activities and beliefs. However, there is a point in the video where the Complainant is shown having a beer with some people and discussing an event at a Vancouver book store where Mr. Icke would be present to sign his book. Although it was not entirely clear, it would appear that the Complainant suggested that a pie might be thrown at Mr. Icke during the book signing. The video shows that this pie was eventually thrown at Mr. Icke.\n[164] I find that the video has little weight. It is based on incidents that occurred in March 2000. This predates the complaint by a significant amount of time. It does, however, lend limited support to the finding that the Complainant has a combative spirit that may render him somewhat impervious to threatening behaviour.\nThe Complainant's Participation in the VNN Forum and Cooperation with Journalists\n[165] The Complainant participated in the VNN Forum under the pseudonym Axetogrind. He testified that he did so in order to monitor the website. To do this, he would pose as someone who was interested in or supportive of the ideas that were being expressed in the Forum. He would ask questions such as So what, you're going to keep us in suspense? and, at times, he would express his agreement with comments made on the Forum. In cross-examination, the Complainant was asked whether his questions were attempts to get the Respondent into more trouble. The Complainant denied this, stating that the questions were posed in order to get clarification on issues that the Respondent had previously raised. The evidence revealed that the Complainant made 32 postings to the VNN Forum.\n[166] The Complainant also testified that he provided quotes from the Respondent's messages to journalists.\n[167] The Respondent argued that the Complainant's participation in the VNN Forum and the provision of quotes to journalists demonstrated that the Complainant was not particularly sensitive to the kinds of comments that were made about him in the retaliatory messages. That is debatable. I do think that even the most battle-hardened individual may experience emotional suffering when the line is crossed between the expected exchange between two opponents and an escalated attack. However, taken together with the other evidence of the Complainant's campaign against hate messages, the evidence of the Complainant's involvement in the VNN Forum and the provision of quotes to a journalist suggests that the Complainant may have developed a certain emotional detachment and hardiness as compared to other victims of retaliation.\nConclusion Regarding the Complainant's Pain and Suffering\n[168] I believe that the Complainant was concerned when he read postings describing him as a vile acidic Jew, a suspected Jew and other similar terms. In the context of the Respondent's clearly expressed animosity toward people of the Jewish faith, the Complainant's concern was understandable. However, I am not persuaded that the degree of anxiety he experienced justifies the maximum award under s. 53(2)(e).\n[169] The evidence indicated that the Complainant has extensive experience and involvement in organized activities aimed at combatting hate propaganda. Indeed, he has been invited to speak at a number of public events because of his expertise in this area. It is to be expected that involvement in activities of this nature would expose one, on a regular basis, to a certain amount of abusive talk and threatening behaviour. Nevertheless, there is still a line that can be crossed and, suddenly, the situation becomes more serious. Did the Respondent cross that line when he posted a picture of the Complainant on the VNN Forum with the Star of David on his head that looked decidedly like a target mark?\n[170] The difficulty I have with the Complainant's claim to have suffered greatly is that a month or two after the posting with his photograph was made, he was able to publicly state, in a speech to the ARA, that he uses his maximum disruption approach, which includes the laying of human rights complaints, whenever he thinks it will be most helpful or even if he just feels it will be the most fun. He also indicated that he files human rights complaints against neo-Nazis starting on a worst offender basis, although if he finds people to be particularly annoying this may move them up the list a bit.\n[171] It appears to me that there was a certain amount of saber rattling that went on between the Complainant and the Respondent and this does not appear to have immobilized the Complainant with fear. Indeed, although he stated that he was extremely concerned about the photograph of himself on the Internet, the Complainant subsequently intended to publicly display the Respondent's picture at the ARA conference, and in his speech he called the Respondent a nasty piece of work. That kind of conduct is not suggestive of someone who is terribly alarmed by the Respondent. Rather, it suggests somewhat of a cavalier attitude and even a whimsical mockery of the Respondent's activities. I agree with the Respondent that this lends an air of implausibility to the Complainant's claim to have suffered to such an extent that a damage award in the order of $20,000.00 would be warranted.\n[172] Thus, I find that although the Complainant likely experienced some concern about the retaliatory messages, he appears to be a very resilient person who is somewhat impervious to threats and insults. Therefore, in all the circumstances, I am of the view that an award of $500 for pain and suffering is appropriate.\n(iii) Special Compensation [173] Section 53(3) of the Act provides that the Tribunal may award compensation in an amount not exceeding $20,000 to the victim where a respondent has engaged in the discriminatory practice willfully or recklessly.\n[174] I find that the Respondent either intended to retaliate against the Complainant or he acted in reckless disregard of the consequences of posting the messages about the Complainant.\n[175] There are two messages which provide evidence that the Respondent intentionally retaliated or threatened retaliation against the Complainant for filing a human rights complaint against him. In the posting made on March 13, 2004, the Respondent stated that he had fallen under the Jew radar when a vile acidic Jew - Richard Warman (he says he's NOT a Jew) launched a complaint against him.\n[176] The second message is the one communicated in May 2005, in which the Respondent displayed the Complainant's picture under the heading My Enemies with the Star of David emblazoned on his forehead. Within that same thread, the Respondent provided a roundup, or a list of the human rights complaints against White nationalists and placed the complaint against him first on that list. I find that the proximity of the My Enemies posting to the list of human rights complaints gives rise to an inference that the enemies posting was also intended as retaliation or a threat of retaliation for the human rights complaint.\n[177] On the basis of the above-noted evidence, it can reasonably be inferred that the other messages in which the Respondent refers to the Complainant in derogatory and threatening terms were part of an intentional campaign on the part of the Respondent to retaliate against the Complainant. While there were other reasons that could have motivated the Respondent to target the Complainant, there was no evidence of targeting before the complaint was filed. Therefore, I find that a significant factor influencing the Respondent's retaliatory conduct was the fact that the Complainant had filed a human rights complaint against him.\n[178] In determining the appropriate quantum for an award under s. 53(3), the Tribunal's focus is on the Respondent's conduct and not on the effect that this conduct has had on the Complainant. (See for example: Milano v. Triple K. Transport Ltd. 2003 CHRT 30; Woiden v. Lynn [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 18 (Q.L.); Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, supra; Kyburz, supra). The effects of the conduct are considered when remedies are ordered under s. 53(2) of the Act.\n[179] Counsel for the Respondent argued that the term compensation must involve compensation for a loss, intangible though it might be. Therefore, the extent to which the Complainant suffered as a result of the retaliatory action must be relevant in determining the quantum of an award for compensation under s. 53(3).\n[180] I disagree. In my view, the wording of s. 53(3) clearly indicates that compensation is provided for the willful and reckless nature of the Respondent's conduct. There is no indication in s. 53(3) that the victim's suffering must be established in order to make an award for compensation. The provision for compensation for willful and reckless discriminatory conduct under s. 53(3) is separate from s. 53(2)(e) which provides for compensation for pain and suffering. Section 53(3) makes no reference whatsoever to s. 53(2). Thus, in my view, s. 53(3) is aimed at providing compensation for willful and reckless discriminatory conduct regardless of its effects on the complainant. The effects of the respondent's conduct are considered when remedies are ordered under s. 53(2) of the Act.\n[181] Given the willful nature of the Respondent's discriminatory conduct, and in particular his brazen use of the Complainant's photograph with what looked like a target mark on his forehead, I am of the view that the appropriate award for special compensation, pursuant to s. 53(3) of the Act, is $5,000.\n(iv) Expenses Related to the Hearing [182] On behalf of the Complainant, the Commission requested compensation from the Respondent for reasonable travel, meal and accommodation costs incurred by the Complainant in order to attend the hearing. The Commission stated that the venue was not within commuting distance to the Complainant's residence. Therefore, he incurred costs that he would not have incurred had he not been a victim of the discriminatory practice. The Commission paid for a portion of those expenses because the Complainant appeared as a witness for the Commission. However, the Commission argued that, in accordance with the goal of making the victim whole, the Respondent should reimburse the Complainant for that portion of his travel, meal and accommodation costs that were not covered by the Commission. There was no evidence provided as to what these costs might be.\n[183] Section 53(2)(c) provides that, where the complaint is substantiated, the Tribunal may compensate victims for any expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice. The power to award compensation under this provision, like all orders under s. 53, is discretionary. It is true that the exercise of the Tribunal's remedial discretion is guided by the principle of making the victim whole. However, not all expenses incurred as a result of a Tribunal hearing have been found to be sufficiently connected to the discriminatory practice to permit them to fall within the reach of s. 53(2)(c). For example, in Attorney General of Canada v. Lambie, (1996), 124 F.T.R. 303 (F.C.T.D.) at para. 41, the Federal Court held that the word expense is not broad enough to cover time spent in preparation for a hearing except in exceptional circumstances.\n[184] It is not at all clear that travel, accommodation and meal expenses are the kind of expenses contemplated by s. 53(2)(c). Indeed, counsel for the Commission conceded that she could not find any authority for such an award. Unlike the situation in Brown v. R.C.M.P., 2004 CHRT 30, the expenses in this case are not directly related to presenting a case before the Tribunal; they are one step removed from the actual presentation of a case. Moreover, I am of the view that there is nothing exceptional about the circumstances that would warrant an award for reimbursement of travel, meal and accommodation costs in the present case.\n[185] The Complainant, who testified that he is a lawyer, represented himself during the hearing. The Canadian Human Rights Commission, whose role is to represent the public interest, was represented by two lawyers. Although not always the case, in the present inquiry the interests of the Commission and the Complainant were well aligned. Indeed, the Commission called the Complainant as a witness and therefore, according to Commission counsel, was able to cover some of the expenses that the Complainant incurred as a result of the hearing into this matter.\n[186] For these reasons I am not convinced that it would be appropriate to order the Respondent to reimburse the Complainant's travel, accommodation and meal costs. I, therefore, decline to make the order requested by the Commission under s. 53(2)(c).\n(v) Interest [187] Section 53(4) provides the Tribunal with the authority to include an award of interest. Interest shall be paid on the monies awarded pursuant to this decision in accordance with Rule 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure. Interest will start to run from the date of this decision to the date of payment. In no case, however, should the total amount payable under s. 53(2)(e), including interest, exceed $20,000: Hebert v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), (1993), 23 C.H.R.R. D\/ 107 (F.C.T.D.). The same is true for the award under s. 53(3).\nB. Hate Messages - Section 13 [188] Section 54 sets out the orders that may be made with respect to hate messages. It incorporates, by reference, certain orders that may be made under section 53 for other cases of discrimination. Thus, an order under s. 53(2)(a) may be made which includes, among other measures, an order that the person cease the discriminatory practice. In addition, s. 54 authorizes orders under s. 53(3) to compensate a victim who has been specifically identified in the discriminatory messages. Finally, there is provision for a penalty under s. 54(1)(c) of not more than ten thousand dollars.\n[189] The Commission and the Complainant have requested the following:\nan order that the Respondent cease and desist the communication of messages like the ones that were the subject of the section 13 complaint; an order that the Respondent provide the Complainant with special compensation in the amount of $20,000. an order that the Respondent pay a penalty in the amount of $10,000.\n(i) Cease and Desist Order [190] Respondent counsel argued that a cease and desist order would produce undesirable effects. It would communicate the message that disagreeable thoughts cannot exist in Canada and it may, in fact, promote the expression of such thoughts through other means that are less peaceful than Internet messages. Finally, a cease and desist order would serve to further alienate the Respondent from Canadian society.\n[191] I cannot agree. The Respondent is free to express his thoughts and ideas, as disagreeable as those may be, provided they do not violate the law. The Respondent chose not to testify during the hearing. However, while he was representing himself during the early part of the hearing and during the case management process, he struck me as a respectful, reasonable and straightforward man. He did not behave in a belligerent fashion. He attempted to put forward his point of view with quiet reason. It is to be hoped that in the future, the Respondent will maintain that same composure and respectfulness in his communications with the rest of the world through the Internet.\n[192] It should also be noted that, in deciding whether to issue a cease and desist order, the potential impact of such an order on the Respondent is not my only consideration. I must also consider the likely impact of a cease and desist order on other members of Canadian society such as those who are likely to be exposed to hatred or contempt as a result of the Respondent's messages. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in Taylor, the process of hearing a complaint made under s. 13(1) and, if substantiated, issuing a cease and desist order reminds Canadians of our fundamental commitment to equality of opportunity and the eradication of racial and religious intolerance (Taylor, supra, at para. 53). Therefore, I am of the view that a cease and desist order is entirely appropriate in the present case.\n[193] Accordingly, the Tribunal orders that the Respondent, Mr. Tomasz Winnicki cease the discriminatory practice of communicating by the means described in s. 13 of the Act, namely the Internet, material of the type that was found to violate s. 13(1) in the present case, or any other matter of a substantially similar content that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(ii) Section 54(1)(b) - Special Compensation [194] Section 54(1)(b) provides the Tribunal with the authority to issue an order under subsection 53(3) to compensate a victim specifically identified in the communication that constituted the discriminatory practice. Subsection 53(3) states that the Tribunal may order the person to pay compensation to the victim if the Tribunal finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice willfully or recklessly.\n[195] The Commission argued that the eight messages that were found to be violations of s. 14.1 also constituted violations of s. 13(1). I agreed and found that the same messages violated both provisions of the Act. I awarded the Complainant compensation for pain and suffering under s. 53(2)(e), as well as providing an award under s. 53(3) in recognition of the willful and reckless nature of the discriminatory conduct.\n[196] The Commission then argued that the Complainant was also entitled to special compensation under s. 54(1)(b) in respect of the same set of eight messages. According to the Commission, it was plain and obvious on the face of the eight messages in which the Respondent names the Complainant that he intended to do so. The Commission argued that an award of compensation in the amount of $20,000 would be appropriate given the clearly intentional nature of the Respondent's conduct.\n[197] The Respondent argued that providing compensation under both s. 54(1)(b) and s. 53(3) for the same messages would amount to double recovery. I agree.\n[198] In assessing the appropriateness of an order for special compensation in Kyburz, the Tribunal was careful not to include in its consideration, the messages that had been found to be violations of s. 14.1 of the Act. It may well be that this was done in order to avoid the potential for double recovery.\n[199] In the present case, however, it does not seem logical to dissect the series of eight messages in which the Respondent named and threatened the Complainant in order to fashion a remedy. The messages were part of a continuous pattern of conduct which violated s. 14.1 and s. 13(1) of the Act. They were clearly made in response to a series of actions that the Complainant took against the Respondent, including the filing of a human rights complaint. They were part of an ongoing battle between the two individuals and should be viewed as a whole.\n[200] I have provided compensation under s. 53(3) for the willful or reckless nature of the Respondent's discriminatory conduct in retaliating or threatening retaliation against the Complainant. It would not, in my view, be appropriate to provide further compensation under s. 54(1)(b) for the willful or reckless nature of the Respondent's conduct with respect to the same series of messages. This is because I do not think that the willful and reckless conduct of the Respondent in retaliating against the Complainant can be meaningfully distinguished from his willfulness or recklessness in naming the Complainant in the same series of messages.\n[201] In Chopra v. Canada (A.G.) 2006 FC 9 (appeal pending: A-52-06), the Federal Court stated that a corollary of the principle of restoring a victim to his\/her rightful place is that the victim should not be overcompensated. Human rights awards should not result in unrealistic or windfall compensation. Such a result would undermine the integrity of the strong social justice purpose of the legislation (Chopra, supra, at para. 42).\n[202] In my view, providing an award of special compensation under s. 54(1)(b) for conduct relating to the same series of messages for which special compensation has already been provided under s. 53(3) would result in overcompensation of the Complainant.\n[203] For these reasons, I decline to order that the Respondent pay special compensation under s. 54(1)(b).\n(iii) Penalty [204] Subsection 54(1)(c) of the Act permits the Tribunal to order a respondent in a s. 13 complaint, where substantiated, to pay a penalty of up to $10,000. The Commission requested an Order that the Respondent be required to pay a $10,000 penalty in this case, arguing that the messages in this case are among the most vicious and intensely hateful messages that they have seen. Moreover, right up until a week before the hearing in this case began, the Respondent was still posting messages on the Internet.\n[205] The Respondent argues that Warman v. Warman 2005 CHRT 36 has cast some uncertainty on the constitutionality of s. 54(1)(c). Although counsel for the Respondent indicated that the Respondent was not challenging the constitutionality of the provision, she argued that the Tribunal should consider the constitutional uncertainty created by Warman v. Warman when deciding whether to order a penalty.\n[206] I reject this argument. A legislative provision is valid until such time as it is declared invalid. There is no such thing as constitutional uncertainty, in my view. The Tribunal cannot decline to apply the statute for fear that it may be invalid. It may only decline to apply the statute if it has been found to be invalid, on the basis of evidence and argument, and with proper notice to the Attorneys General. This has not been done in the present case. Moreover, I would note that in Schnell, this Tribunal found that the amendments to the Act which added the penalty and special compensation provisions to the remedies available under the Act, did not render s. 13 unconstitutional.\n[207] In deciding whether to order the Respondent to pay a penalty in this case, Parliament has directed, under s. 54(1.1), that the Tribunal take the following factors into account:\nThe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice; The willfulness or intent of the person who engaged in the discriminatory practice; Any prior discriminatory practices that the person has engaged in; and The person's ability to pay the penalty.\n[208] I find that the messages were vicious and dehumanizing. In my view, there is evidence on the basis of the wording of the messages alone, that the Respondent intended to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred and contempt and that he intended to convince people to think as he did. The Respondent called for the forced expulsion of non-Caucasian people, he threatened violent action against the targets of his hatred and enthusiastically supported a racial holy war in which all non-Caucasian people will be destroyed. He made use of exceedingly gruesome photographic imagery to draw in his readers and to communicate his messages of hate all the more powerfully.\n[209] The Respondent clearly communicated his messages in willful disregard of the likely consequences of his conduct. He used the Internet, a medium that has a pervasive and powerful presence in society, to engage in this conduct. There is, however, no evidence that the Respondent has engaged in any prior discriminatory practices.\n[210] The Respondent chose not to testify in the present case. Therefore, the Tribunal has no indication of his ability to pay other than a posting in which he states that he is reasonably well off, with a steady paying job, not much expenditures, all bills paid on time without much hassle. It may be that the Respondent is no longer reasonably well off. However, in the absence of any evidence from the Respondent, I find that there is no reason to reduce the penalty on the basis of an inability to pay it.\n[211] Taking all of these factors into account, I order the Respondent to pay a penalty in the amount of $6,000. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order, payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of the Respondent being notified of this decision.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] The complainant, John Ennis, has filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated July 11, 2002. He alleges that the respondent, Tobique First Nation, discriminated against him contrary to s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, by raising the Social Basic Rates by 5% without at the same time increasing the Disability Rates for members of the Tobique First Nation.\n[2] The respondent seeks an order from the Tribunal that s. 67 of the CHRA applies, so that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the complaint.\n[3] The Social Basic Rates were increased following the Band Council Resolution dated May 23, 2000. The respondent argues that the payment of social assistance monies to band members is authorized by ss. 66 and 69 of the Indian Act. Further, the band must pay social assistance in accordance with the First Nations Social Development Manual for Malisset at Tobique.\n[4] Under s. 66(1) of the Indian Act, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, with the consent of the Band Council, may authorize and direct the expenditure of revenue monies for any purpose that will promote the general progress and welfare of the band or any member thereof.\n[5] Section 66(2) authorizes the Minister to make expenditures out of revenue monies of the Band to assist sick, disabled, aged or destitute band members.\n[6] Section 69(1) provides that the Governor in Council may by order permit a Band to control, manage and expend in whole or in part its revenue monies.\n[7] In its motion, the respondent merely asserts that ss. 66 and 69 of the Indian Act constitute the legal authority for the respondent Band Council to dispense social assistance payments.\n[8] The respondent has not provided any evidence of the Band Council's consent or the Minister's authorization and direction as required by s. 66.\n[9] Section 66(2) authorizes the Minister, not the Band, to make expenditures out of band revenue monies.\n[10] The respondent did not provide any evidence of an order by the Governor in Council permitting the Band to deal with its revenue monies under s. 69.\n[11] There are a number of cases that have considered s. 67 of the CHRA. The first case is Desjarlais v. Piapot Band No. 75, [1989] 3 F.C. 605, 12 C.H.R.R. D\/466 (C.A.). In this case, the Band dismissed its Band Administrator pursuant to a formal resolution of the Band Council. The resolution was a vote of non-confidence in the complainant, based on complaints relating to her age. She filed a complaint with the Commission alleging discrimination because of age.\n[12] Ultimately the case was heard by the Federal Court of Appeal, which rejected the respondent's argument that s. 67 of the CHRA applied.\n[13] In interpreting s. 67, the Court considered that the words . . . or any provisions made under or pursuant to that Act included any decision taken by a Band Council under a specific section of the Indian Act. But the Court concluded that a vote of non-confidence in an employee of the Band was not specifically authorized by the Indian Act. Section 67 did not apply.\n[14] The next case in this line of cases is Canada (Human Right Commission) v. Canada (DIAND), (1995), 25 C.H.R.R. D\/386) (Prince). Section 115 of the Indian Act authorizes the Minister of Indian Affairs to make policies in regard to the funding of native children to attend residential schools. The Minister adopted a policy requiring native children to attend the school closest to their residence. The complainant's daughter attended a religious school away from home and was denied governmental assistance.\n[15] The Tribunal declined jurisdiction, reasoning that the Minister's funding decision was a decision under s. 115 of the Indian Act, so that s. 67 of the CHRA applied. The Federal Court, on review, agreed with the Tribunal.\n[16] In MacNutt v. Shubenacadie Indian Band Council, [1998] 2 F.C. 198; aff'd (2000), 37 C.H.R.R. D\/466 (F.C.A.), a non-Indian spouse, who lived on the reserve with permission of the Band Council, was denied social assistance. The federal government had contracted with the Band to administer the social assistance program for band members. The guidelines for administering the agreement specifically provided that a non-Indian spouse who resides legally on a reserve is eligible for benefits.\n[17] The case went to the Federal Court, which decided that the Band Council's decision to deny benefits was not immunized by s. 67 of the CHRA. The Court pointed out that the Band Council's decision was not based on any specific provision of the Indian Act.\n[18] Further, s. 67 of the CHRA should not be taken as exempting all Band Council decisions, but only those decisions authorized by the Indian Act.\n[19] The respondent appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal. In its reasons confirming the lower court decision, the Court of Appeal reviewed the history of social assistance agreements between the Federal Government and First Nations.\n[20] The Court noted that in 1996, Parliament enacted the Canada Assistance Plan (CAP), which provided for cost sharing income maintenance programs between the Federal Government and the provinces. Under Part II of the CAP, the Minister for DIAND could enter into such cost-sharing agreements to extend provincial welfare payments to Indian residents on reserves. No province to date has signed a Part II agreement.\n[21] Apart from the CAP, Parliament has not enacted any legislation that expressly provides for social assistance to Indian residents on reserves. However, since 1964, Treasury Board has had in place a policy which authorizes DIAND to provide social assistance to First Nations. This is the legal basis for such social assistance programs, and it is found in Treasury Board Minute Number 627879, which was adopted on July 16, 1964.\n[22] In its reasons, the Court referenced a document entitled Background of the Development of the Social Assistance Program. (This document is also included in Appendix 1 of the respondent's First Nations Manual.)\n[23] According to this Background document, Treasury Board Minute Number 627879 authorized DIAND to adopt provincial and municipal welfare assistance rates and conditions in the administration of social assistance programs to First Nations. The Background document confirms that there is no specific legislation providing for social assistance programs for First Nations.\n[24] The respondent did not provide the Tribunal with any contract or agreement between DIAND and the Maliseet Nation at Tobique relating to the funding of its social assistance program. (Presumably such an agreement is in place). Instead, the respondent pointed to the Tobique First Nations Development Manual as authorizing the May 23, 2000 Band Council Resolution. My reading of the Manual does not show that it is the source of the Band Council's authority. Rather, the Manual provides the guidelines and procedures for the Band to administer the social development program. Even if it can be viewed as the basis for the May 23, 2000 Resolution, the Resolution is not a provision made under or pursuant to the Indian Act.\n[25] In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Gordon Band Council, [2001] 1 F.C. 124 (C.A.), the complainant, a status Indian who lived on the Gordon First Nation Band reserve with her non-Indian spouse, applied for rental housing on the reserve. Her request was denied by the Band Council. She filed a complaint with the Commission alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and family status.\n[26] The respondent raised s. 67 of the CHRA and the Tribunal concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The Tribunal reasoned that the Band Council's decision not to allot housing to the complainant was specifically authorized under s. 20 of the Indian Act. Section 20 provides that no Indian is lawfully in possession of land on a reserve unless, with the approval of the Minister, it has been allotted to him by the Band Council.\n[27] The Federal Court of Appeal agreed with the Tribunal. In its reasons, the Court said, as did the Tribunal, that s. 67 of the CHRA must be narrowly interpreted because it limits the scope of human rights legislation. In this regard, the Court relied on the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Zurich Insurance Company v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 321, at 339, where the Supreme Court accorded the Ontario's Human Rights Code quasi-constitutional status, such that any exceptions to the legislation had to be narrowly construed.\n[28] Substantively, the Court accepted that s. 20 confers not only the authority to make a housing allotment, but also, by necessary implication, the authority to refuse a housing allotment.\n[29] The most recent two cases on s. 67 are Bernard v. Waycobah Board of Education, (1999) 36 C.H.R.R. D\/51 (C.H.R.T.) and Bressette v. Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation Band Council (No. 1) 2003 CHRT 41. In Bernard, the complainant, a member of the Waycobah First Nation, was employed as a school secretary. Her employment was terminated by the respondent because of her conduct on two or three occasions, which the Board believed was caused by a mental disability. She filed a complaint with the Commission alleging discrimination on the grounds of disability.\n[30] The respondent argued that s. 114 of the Indian Act, which authorizes the Minister to establish, maintain and operate schools for Indian children, authorized the Board of Education to make the decision it did.\n[31] The Tribunal rejected this argument. Although, said the Tribunal, s. 114(2) of the Indian Act does so authorize the Minister, there was no substantive connection between s. 114(2) of the Indian Act and the decision of the Waycobah Board of Education to terminate the complainant's employment.\n[32] Bressette v. Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation Band Council involved a status Indian and member of the Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation who applied for, but was not given, the position of Band family case worker. He filed a complaint with the Commission alleging that he was denied the job on the ground of family status.\n[33] The respondent argued that its decision was specifically authorized under ss. 69, 81 and 83 of the Indian Act. Sections 81 and 83 authorize Band Councils to make by-laws dealing with the subject matters specified in those sections.\n[34] In the final analysis however, the respondent relied on two regulations under the Indian Act, both of which, in general terms, provide for the management, control and expenditure of band revenue monies.\n[35] The Tribunal concluded that the decision of the respondent had both a staffing aspect and a financial aspect. But the predominant purpose of the Band Council's decision was to staff the family case worker position. There is no specific provision in the Indian Act relating to staffing positions for a band. Thus, s. 67 did not apply.\n[36] In my opinion, the same reasoning applies to this case. The Band Council Resolution of May 23, 2000 was a decision that involved the allocation of social assistance funds to band members living on the reserve. The expenditure of revenue monies was only consequential to this decision.\nConclusion [37] The preceding analysis of the Indian Act, the Tribunal decisions, and the Court decisions establishes the following:\nSection 67 of the CHRA must be given a narrow interpretation, being an exception to human rights legislation; The predominant purpose of the Band Council Resolution of May 23, 2000 was the allocation of social assistance benefits to band members on the reserve; There is no specific provision in the Indian Act that authorizes a Band Council to make decisions relating to the allocation of social assistance to members of the band living on a reserve. The legal authority is the 1964 Treasury Board Minute Number 627879; Of the cases dealing with the application of s. 67 of the CHRA, only two have concluded that the decision of the Band Council was exempt from human rights review. In these two cases, the Band Council's decision was supported by a specific provision of the Indian Act; In the other cases, the respondent was unable to point to any specific section of the Indian Act to support the decision complained of; In none of the cases referred to where the Band Council's decision involved the expenditure of band monies, did the Tribunal or Court find that the impugned decision was justified by ss. 66 or 69 of the Indian Act; In fact, other than in Bressette, no respondents argued that these decisions were, or could be, supported under ss. 66 or 69; There is no evidence that the pre-conditions for the exercise of the power granted under ss. 66 and 69 have been satisfied; Sections 66 and 69 are general and non-specific, and should not prevail over human rights review, given the judicial directive that s. 67 of the CHRA must be narrowly interpreted.\n[38] For all these reasons, the respondent's motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ.

Western Canada for Us\nCollection\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nDate\n2006-05-08\nNeutral citation\n2006 CHRT 23\nFile number(s)\nT1087\/6805, T1088\/6905\nDecision-maker(s)\nJensen, Karen A.\nDecision type\nRuling\nDecision Content\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL TRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nRICHARD WARMAN\nComplainant\n- and -\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION\nCommission\n- and -\nGLENN BAHR\n- and -\nWESTERN CANADA FOR US\nResponden\nRULING\n2006 CHRT 23 2006\/05\/08\nMEMBER: Karen A Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion presented by Mr. Glenn Bahr for an adjournment of the hearing in this matter which is scheduled to begin on May 23, 2006. The complaint involves allegations that Mr. Bahr and Western Canada for Us communicated hate messages by means of the Internet, in violation of s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] Mr. Bahr has also been charged under s. 319(2) of the Criminal Code, which is the provision dealing with the willful promotion of hatred. The preliminary hearing in this matter began in January 2006 and is due to resume in October 2006 in Edmonton, Alberta. A publication ban has been issued in those proceedings.\n[3] Mr. Bahr's representative argues that if the present inquiry is not adjourned pending the resolution of the criminal proceedings against him, his right to a fair criminal trial will be infringed. The publicity surrounding the Tribunal hearings will subvert the purpose of the publication ban in the criminal proceedings which is to ensure that potential jurors will not be biased by what they have read about the case in the media. Also, it is argued that the testimony that Mr. Bahr might give during the hearing into the present complaint could be used against him in the criminal trial.\n[4] In addition, it is argued that Mr. Bahr's right to a fair hearing in the present proceedings will be infringed. Mr. Bahr initially stated his intention to testify on his own behalf in his Statement of Particulars. He has subsequently amended that Statement to indicate that, in order to preserve his right to remain silent, he has no choice but to refuse to testify during the human rights proceedings. As a result, he states that he will be unable to properly defend himself against the s. 13 complaint. This, he argues, is a clear breach of the rules of natural justice.\n[5] The Complainant, Mr. Richard Warman, argues that the Tribunal has the power, under s. 52(1) of the Act to issue a confidentiality order if needed to ensure that the goals of the publication ban issued in the criminal proceedings are not undermined. Moreover, the Complainant argues that Mr. Bahr is not required to testify or to incriminate himself during the hearing into the s. 13 complaint. He is free to choose the manner in which he will participate in the hearing and the fairness of the process will not be affected by this choice. According to the Complainant, an adjournment of the present proceedings would result in an indefinite delay of the hearing. This would be contrary to the goal of providing for the most expeditious and informal resolution of complaints as the requirements of fairness and natural justice will allow.\n[6] The Canadian Human Rights Commission echoes the submissions of the Complainant and adds that Mr. Bahr has failed to show that the safeguards and protections that may be utilized to ensure that his right to a fair criminal trial and a fair hearing before this Tribunal will be insufficient or ineffective.\n[7] In Baltruweit v. CSIS, this Tribunal stated that it does not have the authority to stay its own proceedings (Baltruweit v. CSIS 2004 CHRT 14, at para 12). However, as master of its own process, the Tribunal has the discretionary power to grant an adjournment. In exercising its discretion to grant an adjournment, the Tribunal must determine whether an adjournment is necessary in order to respect the principles of natural justice (Baltruweit, supra, at para. 17). In other words, the question is whether it would be fair to the parties to proceed with the hearing as scheduled.\n[8] It is by no means unusual for the same factual circumstances to give rise to both administrative proceedings before a tribunal such as this one, as well as criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings involving the same parties and similar factual and legal issues. (See, for example: Seth v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) [1993] 3 F.C. 348 (F.C.A.); Spagucci's Ltd. v. Alberta (Gaming Commission) (1997), 55 Alta. L.R. (3d) 173 (Alta. Q.B.); and Willock v. British Columbia (Superintendant of Motor Vehicles) 2000 BCSC 772 (B.S.S.C.)). Frequently, in situations like this, one of the parties will express the concern, as Mr. Bahr has done in the present case, that the protection against self-incrimination and the fairness of the proceedings will be violated by allowing both proceedings to take place at the same time.\n[9] The constitutionally enshrined protection against self-incrimination is based on the principle that the state is not permitted to conscript individuals against themselves. Rather, the state is subject to a positive obligation to establish a case against the accused through other sources or only with the informed and voluntary cooperation of the accused (Phillips et al v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy) ([1995] 2 S.C.R. 97 at para. 80). Therefore, when an accused person is compelled to testify outside of the criminal court, the extent to which these principles may be jeopardized by that testimony must be ascertained.\n[10] However, the courts have clearly stated that the fact that an individual is involved in contemporaneous civil and criminal proceedings does not necessarily compromise the fairness of either proceeding or the right to protection from self-incrimination (Phillips et al, supra, at para. 165). For that reason, it is not sufficient for the party requesting an adjournment of the civil proceedings to simply allege that the concurrency of the proceedings will violate the right to a fair hearing and the protection against self-incrimination. Rather, the onus is on the party requesting the adjournment to demonstrate the following: (1) the civil proceedings will compel the party to break his or her silence and, (2) the compulsion to testify will result in a specific prejudice, the degree of which renders the circumstances so extraordinary or exceptional that an adjournment is warranted (Nash v. Ontario (1995), 27 O.R. (3d) 1 (O.C.A.); C.B. v. Caughell (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 741 (On. Div. Ct.); Spagucci, supra, at para. 10; Seth v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), supra, at paragraphs 17 and 18).\n[11] I see no reason why the test set out above should not be followed in the context of proceedings before this Tribunal.\nI. Will the Tribunal hearing compel Mr. Bahr to break his silence? [12] Mr. Bahr has stated that he has no choice but to refuse to testify at the Tribunal hearings in order to preserve his right to silence. However, the rights to silence and the protection against self-incrimination are threatened only when one is compelled or coerced to disclose incriminating information. These rights are not violated by voluntary disclosure: (R. v. Van Haarlem (1991), 135 N.R. 379 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 386: aff'd [1992] 1 S.C.R. 982.) Is one compelled or coerced to testify at an administrative proceeding when it appears to be the only way to successfully defend oneself?\n[13] The courts have drawn a distinction between situations where an individual believes that it is strategically necessary for him or her to testify and where an individual is compelled by law to testify. Generally speaking, the courts have held that where one has a choice about electing to come forward to provide information at an administrative hearing, and one does so in order to present information necessary to establish one's case, this does not amount to being compelled or coerced to give information (see, e.g.: Spagucci's Ltd, supra, at para. 8; Willock v. British Columbia (Superintendant of Motor Vehicles) supra, at para. 14; White v. Nova Scotia (Registrar of Motor Vehicles) (1996) 20 M.V.R. (3d) 192 (N.S.S.C.) at para. 35; contra: Williams v. Superintendent of Insurance (N.S.) (1993), 125 N.S.R. (2d) 323)). Thus, the weight of judicial authority suggests that when an individual is not required by law to testify at an administrative proceeding, but rather is able to make an informed choice about whether to testify, the rights to silence and to protection against self-incrimination are not violated.\n[14] In the present case, although he may not perceive that he has a choice about whether to testify at the Tribunal hearing, Mr. Bahr does, in fact, have a choice; there is no legal requirement that Mr. Bahr testify. Moreover, he has the benefit of legal counsel representing him during the criminal proceedings and someone assisting him during the pre-hearing matters in the Tribunal proceedings. Mr. Bahr is, therefore, in a position to make an informed choice regarding his participation in the Tribunal proceedings. As a result, his right to silence and to protection from self-incrimination will not be violated by proceeding with the Tribunal's inquiry into the complaint.\nII. Has Mr. Bahr discharged the burden of proving that there are extraordinary circumstances in this case that warrant the granting of an adjournment? [15] In Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Lundgren [1993] 1 F.C. 187 (T.D.) at para. 14, Mr. Justice Dub\u00e9 stated: I know of no general principle in Canada that the existence of civil and criminal proceedings in court at the same time involving the same persons and the same facts is automatically a valid reason justifying the adjournment of the civil proceedings. Rather, he stated, it is only under extraordinary circumstances, in which the civil proceedings might cause some damage to the accused's defence to the criminal charge, that adjourning the civil action would be justified.\n[16] The burden of proof is on the party applying for the adjournment to conclusively demonstrate the existence of such harm: a mere allegation will not suffice. Moreover, even the potential disclosure through the civil proceedings of the nature of the accused's defence or of self-incriminating evidence does not necessarily constitute extraordinary circumstances that warrant the adjournment of civil proceedings (Nash, Falloncrest Financial Corporation et al v. Ontario (1995), 27 O.R. (3d) 1 (O.C.A.).\n[17] For the following reasons, I find that Mr. Bahr has not succeeded in establishing that there are extraordinary circumstances in the present case that warrant adjourning the Tribunal's proceedings.\n[18] As I have previously stated, Mr. Bahr has a choice as to whether to testify during the Tribunal hearing. Should he choose to testify, there are a number of protections at law that may well be available to him during the criminal proceedings to ensure that his rights to a fair trial and to protection against self-incrimination will be protected. If Mr. Bahr finds himself in a situation where, having decided to testify at the Tribunal hearing, he is asked a question that has the potential to incriminate him, he may well be able to claim the protection of s. 13 of the Charter and s. 5(2) of the Canada Evidence Act in the criminal proceedings.\n[19] Section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act allows any witness to object to a question if he or she believes that the answer will tend to incriminate him or her. The witness will still be required to answer the question, but in turn for the giving of potentially incriminating evidence, the statute prohibits the use of the answers in any other proceedings against the witness (R. v. No\u00ebl 2002 SCC 67, at para. 25).\n[20] Section 13 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms also protects a witness from the use of incriminating testimony in any other proceedings against the witness. Under s. 13, unlike under s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, the witness need not object at the time that the original evidence is given. The protection is automatically afforded to an accused regardless of whether the evidence was - or was believed to be - incriminating at the time it was given (R. v. No\u00ebl, supra, at para. 32).\n[21] The protection offered by s. 13 of the Charter and s. 5(2) of the Canada Evidence Act is available to a witness whether he or she chooses to testify or is compelled to testify (R. v. No\u00ebl, supra, at para. 25). It is, of course, a matter for the criminal court to decide whether testimony given during the Tribunal proceedings should be excluded on the basis of s. 13 of the Charter or s. 5(2) of the Canada Evidence Act. Mr. Bahr has not shown why these protections will be insufficient or unsatisfactory.\n[22] Mr. Bahr has also argued that proceeding with the Tribunal Inquiry will subvert the publication ban that has been ordered in the criminal proceedings since the Tribunal proceedings will engender the publicity that the publication ban is designed to eliminate. Given the similarity in the nature of the alleged offenses under the Criminal Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act, it is argued that the publicity surrounding the Tribunal proceedings may well threaten the impartiality of potential jurors in his criminal trial. This, in turn, will jeopardize Mr. Bahr's right to a fair criminal trial.\n[23] There are a number of responses to this argument. First of all, Mr. Bahr's arguments at this point are speculative. It is unclear whether Mr. Bahr will testify at the Tribunal hearing or whether he will be electing to be heard by judge and jury at his criminal trial. Nor do we know what the nature of the publicity surrounding the Tribunal proceedings will be. It is precisely this sort of uncertainty that was found by the minority of the Supreme Court in Phillips to be inadequate to justify a conclusion that the fair trial rights of all of the accused in that case were in jeopardy.\n[24] Secondly, the Canadian Human Rights Act provides the authority to order a publication ban or confidentiality orders in the appropriate circumstances. Section 52(1)(c) of the Act stipulates that the Tribunal may take any measures and make any order necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry if the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved and that this outweighs the societal interest in a public hearing. Section 52(1)(d) provides for confidentiality orders where the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered. The Tribunal has ordered a publication ban pursuant to s. 52 of the Act under the appropriate circumstances: Day v. DND and M. Hortie 2003 CHRT 12.\n[25] Mr. Bahr, through his representative, has stated that he would strongly oppose a publication ban in the present case. It is argued that the Canadian public should not be denied access to information regarding the potential restriction of freedom of speech through section 13(1) of the Act. Although it is not entirely clear from the Commission's submissions, it would appear that the Commission is suggesting that a publication ban should be ordered in this case. This point was not clearly argued. Therefore, I leave it to the parties to determine whether to request an order under s. 52(1) of the Act. It is sufficient for the purposes of this Ruling to note that, should it be necessary to do so, this Tribunal has the authority to issue a confidentiality order which could include a publication ban.\n[26] In Seth, Mr. Justice D\u00e9cary stated that extraordinary or exceptional circumstances justifying a stay of the civil proceedings would include situations where it was clear that the sole aim and purpose of the civil proceedings was to obtain evidence to support a charge or to assist the criminal prosecution of the witness. Where the proceedings are so devoid of any legitimate public purpose, and so deliberately designed to assist the prosecution of the witness that to allow them to continue would constitute an injustice, then an adjournment would be clearly justified (Seth, supra, at para. 18).\n[27] That is clearly not the case in the present proceedings. Section 2 of the Canadian Human Rights Act establishes the overriding public interest in the elimination of discrimination. Pursuant to s. 48.9 of the Act, the Tribunal is charged with the mandate of inquiring into complaints of discrimination as expeditiously and informally as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure will allow. The purpose of the hearing, which is due to commence on May 23, 2006, is to fulfill the Tribunal's legislative mandate. It is not designed to assist in the prosecution of Mr. Bahr.\n[28] Moreover, this is not a case like Pearson v. R [1999] F.C.J. No. 1298 (Q.L.), wherein the Federal Court upheld a decision by a prothonotary to stay a civil matter where there were pending criminal proceedings. The plaintiff in that case was the accused in the criminal trial. The civil action involved a claim for damages by the Plaintiff for the alleged deprivation by the Crown of the Plaintiff's right to a fair trial in the criminal matter. The Crown requested a stay of the civil proceedings arguing that the question of whether the trial was fair was first raised in the criminal court and therefore, should first be determined there. The Federal Court agreed and stated that the civil action was essentially the reciprocal of the plaintiff's defence in the criminal prosecution.\n[29] That is not the case in the present matter. The human rights complaint is clearly not an action against the Crown, nor is it the reciprocal of Mr. Bahr's defence in the criminal matter. Moreover, despite the fact that the Tribunal and criminal proceedings may involve similar factual issues, there is no legal connection between the two proceedings. In the criminal proceedings the Crown is required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr. Bahr willfully and publicly promoted hatred against an identifiable group. In the Tribunal proceedings, it must be established, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. Bahr and Western Canada for Us exposed a group that is identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, to hatred or contempt. These are very different legal questions that must be determined on the basis of different burdens of proof. Moreover, the proof of one does not necessarily lead to the proof of the other. For example, an acquittal in the criminal proceedings would not necessarily lead to a successful defense against the s. 13 complaint. Similarly, a finding that the s. 13 complaint had been made out would not necessarily lead to a guilty verdict in the criminal proceedings. Finally, other than Mr. Bahr, the parties to the two proceedings are different. For these reasons I am of the view that the Pearson case is not applicable in the present circumstances.\n[30] Mr. Bahr has expressed concern that the lead police investigator in the criminal matter will be present and will be testifying on behalf of the Commission and the Complainant at the Tribunal hearing. This individual's presence at the hearing may serve to strengthen the Crown's case against Mr. Bahr. This, it is implied, constitutes an exceptional circumstance that warrants the adjournment of the proceedings.\n[31] I cannot agree. As I have already indicated, the Tribunal has the power to ensure that its proceedings are confidential in the appropriate circumstances. The Tribunal may also order that witnesses be excluded during the hearing. Therefore, Mr. Bahr's concerns regarding the presence of witnesses who might hear his testimony may be alleviated by the appropriate exercise of the Tribunal's powers under the Act.\n[32] Finally, it must be noted that Mr. Bahr's request is essentially a request for an indefinite adjournment of the Tribunal's proceedings since it is unknown when the criminal matter will be finally determined. Furthermore, as I have indicated, the result in the criminal trial will not necessarily be determinative of the result in the Tribunal proceedings. Therefore, after what might be a lengthy delay to finally dispose of the criminal matter, the parties would then be faced with the prospect of presenting and defending against a case potentially many years after the alleged violation of the Act took place. Not only would this frustrate the goal of providing an expeditious resolution of the complaint, it would not be in the interests of any of the parties to delay the resolution of this matter for an indefinite period of time.\nIII. Conclusion: The Principles of Natural Justice Will Not be violated by Proceeding with the Hearing as Scheduled. [33] For the following reasons, I find that the principles of natural justice will not be violated by proceeding with the Tribunal hearing as scheduled:\nMr. Bahr is able to make an informed choice as to whether to testify during the Tribunal hearing into the s. 13 complaint against him. Therefore, his rights to silence and to protection against self-incrimination will not be violated by proceeding with the Tribunal hearing. If he chooses to testify, he may be able to claim the protection of s. 13 of the Charter and s. 5(2) of the Canada Evidence Act in the subsequent criminal proceedings. Any of the parties may apply to the Tribunal for an order under s. 52 of the Act to ensure the confidentiality of the hearing. A request may also be made that witnesses be excluded from the hearing. The purpose of the Tribunal hearing is to provide an expeditious resolution of the s. 13 complaint against Mr. Bahr and Western Canada for Us. There is no indication that the purpose of the present proceedings is to obtain information from Mr. Bahr to secure a conviction in the criminal proceedings. The proceedings are not connected or linked in any way such that it makes sense to adjourn one pending the resolution of the other. Mr. Bahr has failed to establish that there are any circumstances in this case that are so extraordinary that an adjournment of the proceedings is necessary.\n[34] Therefore, Mr. Bahr's request for an adjournment of the Tribunal's inquiry into the s. 13 complaint against Mr. Bahr and Western Canada for Us is denied.\nsigned by\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion involving two complaints that are scheduled to be heard together on May 23, 2006. The Respondents, Mr. Glenn Bahr and Western Canada for Us (WCFU), have requested that the complaint against Western Canada for Us (WCFU) be dismissed. The complaints involve allegations that WCFU and Glenn Bahr communicated hate messages by means of the Internet contrary to s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] Through his agent, Mr. Bahr argued that WCFU is neither a living human being nor a corporation. It is an Internet website. He further argued that, according to the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Interpretation Act, a respondent in proceedings involving section 13 of the Act must be either a living human being or a corporation. In support of his motion, Mr. Bahr's agent produced the Investigation Report of the Canadian Human Rights Commission which suggests that the Commission investigator thought that WCFU was the website found at the following Internet address: www.westerncanadaforus.com.\n[3] The Complainant, Mr. Richard Warman, argued that the erroneous identification by the Commission investigator of the Respondent WCFU as a website is of no significance at this stage in the process. The proper recourse for disputes about the Commission's process is an application for judicial review before the Federal Court.\n[4] The Complainant also argued that this Tribunal's Ruling in Warman v. Guille and Canadian Heritage Alliance 2006 CHRT 12 is applicable in the present case. In Warman v. Guille and Canadian Heritage Alliance, I held that the appropriate time to resolve the question of whether the Canadian Heritage Alliance was a group of persons acting in concert to communicate was during the hearing on the merits of the complaint when the Tribunal would have the benefit of a full evidentiary record.\n[5] The Commission argued that complaints involving s. 13 of the Act have been substantiated against unincorporated groups of persons as long as some or all of certain indicia are present identifying them as a group.\n[6] The style of cause on the complaint form and the letter of referral from the Canadian Human Rights Commission indicate that the complaints are against Mr. Glenn Bahr and Western Canada for Us, not www.westerncanadaforus.com. Whether Western Canada for Us is a group of persons acting in concert to communicate messages over the Internet within the meaning of s. 13(1) of the Act has yet to be determined. For the reasons that I stated in my ruling in Warman v. Guille, supra, this is a determination that must be made on the basis of adequate evidence. The evidence on the record at this time is inadequate to make such a determination.\n[7] Although the Commission investigator stated that Western Canada for Us was a website, in his Statement of Particulars, Mr. Bahr identifies Western Canada for Us as an Alberta-based group dedicated to immigration reform and freedom of speech. According to Mr. Bahr's Statement of Particulars, Western Canada for Us organized meetings and protests. Thus, there would appear to be different views about the identity of Western Canada for Us and the nature of the activities in which it was involved. The appropriate time to resolve these differences is during the hearing when there will be an opportunity for sworn testimony and cross-examination.\n[8] Therefore, Mr. Bahr's request that the complaint against Western Canada for Us be dismissed is denied without prejudice to his right to renew the request at the hearing on the merits of the complaint.\nsigned by\nKaren A.

Retention of jurisdiction by the Tribunal\n[1] The complainant, Jean-Raymond Audet, alleges that his employer, the Canadian National Railway Company (CN), refused to continue to employ him and did not accommodate him after he had an epileptic seizure on September 10, 2002. He contends that CN thereby discriminated against him on the basis of his disability, in breach of s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] Both Mr. Audet and CN participated at the hearing and were represented by legal counsel. The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not participate. Prior to the start of the hearing, the Commission reached an agreement with the other parties regarding the policy issues engaged by this case in relation to the application of the Railway Association of Canada's Medical Guidelines. The details of the agreement were not disclosed to the Tribunal.\n[3] For the reasons set out below, I have determined that CN discriminated against Mr. Audet by effectively refusing to continue to employ him, on the basis of his disability, without a valid justification under the Act, and that Mr. Audet's complaint has therefore been substantiated.\nI. WHAT FACTS GAVE RISE TO MR. AUDET'S COMPLAINT? A. Mr. Audet's work history at CN [4] Mr. Audet is 47 years old and resides in Sudbury. He became an employee of CN in May of 1988. By July of 1989, Mr. Audet was working as a brakeman, based out of CN's terminal in Capreol, just outside of Sudbury. A typical three-person train crew is comprised of the locomotive engineer, the conductor, and the brakeman, who assists the conductor. The brakeman's duties include moving tracks to switch out rail cars from a train and assisting in the marshalling of the various rail cars.\n[5] In August of 1989, Mr. Audet suffered a single convulsive seizure while working. He was diagnosed with complex-partial epilepsy, also known as Temporal-Lobe epilepsy. As a consequence of that episode, Mr. Audet has been on anti-seizure medication ever since.\n[6] Following the seizure, CN removed Mr. Audet from his position. He received short term disability benefits and employment insurance benefits while off work. In 1992, he was returned to work by CN in the position of yard helper, at CN's MacMillan Yard terminal in Toronto.\n[7] In 1995, Mr. Audet suffered an injury to his back while at work. He received disability benefits and on occasion was assigned light duty work. As a result of his injury, the Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) imposed several work-related restrictions, including a requirement that he not work for prolonged periods of time, that he limit his lifting of heavy objects, and that he avoid repetitive back motions.\n[8] In 1997, CN's Chief Medical Officer identified certain restrictions relating to Mr. Audet's epilepsy that had to be respected in order for him to regain employment as a brakeman on the main rail line. The Chief Medical Officer observed that Mr. Audet had been seizure-free for more than five years and concluded that his chance of a new seizure was quite remote. The restrictions provided that Mr. Audet was not to work alone, and was to always remain in radio or visual contact with a team partner. His team was to be kept informed of the remote possibility of his sudden impairment. All applicable rules regarding rest periods were to be fully respected. No overtime work would be permitted for Mr. Audet, unless it was in an emergency situation.\nB. Mr. Audet's seizure of September 10, 2002 [9] With the issuance of the Chief Medical Officer's letter setting out Mr. Audet's restrictions, he was able to return to work as a brakeman based out of Capreol, in 1998. On certain trains, where crews were only comprised of two persons, he would work as the conductor, a job for which he had been qualified in 1992.\n[10] On account of his relatively low rank on the seniority list for CN's Capreol-based brakemen and conductors, Mr. Audet had been placed on the spare board. As a result, he would be called in to fill vacancies created on the occasions when a regular employee was absent or when none of the regular employees had opted to work on a given shift. Thus, if CN required the services of a brakeman or conductor on a run, Mr. Audet and the other spare board employees would be telephoned on a rotational basis and invited to take the available run. Mr. Audet was remunerated based on the number of hours worked or miles travelled, depending on the circumstances.\n[11] Mr. Audet claims that there was an overall shortage of employees at Capreol in 2002, as a result of which he was called in to work more hours than ever before. He contends that the workload took its toll on him and that by the end of the summer, he was feeling quite tired.\n[12] On the morning of September 10, 2002, he returned to Capreol after helping bring in a train overnight from Hornepayne, Ontario. He got into his car at the end of his shift and was going home to rest. He had booked himself a 24-hour rest period. On the way home, he felt what he describes as an aura coming over him, and he realized immediately that a seizure was imminent. He pulled his car over. He had a seizure but does not recall it. He remembers waking up in an ambulance. He was taken to the hospital but was released several hours later.\n[13] Mr. Audet went home. He did not notify CN of the incident. During the evening of the following day, September 11, 2002, he received a call from CN's dispatcher calling him in to work on an available run, as was the normal practice. Mr. Audet asked if he could be excused from coming in, claiming he did not feel well. The dispatcher replied that without a note from a physician, he would not be considered to be on sick leave. Mr. Audet testified that since he was not in possession of such a note, he felt that he had no choice but to report for work as requested. He completed his train run that night and returned to Capreol the following day, September 12, 2002.\n[14] Mr. Audet's supervisor, Gerald Nadon, who held the position of trainmaster, confirmed in his testimony that CN views negatively any last-minute requests for sick leave that are made to a dispatcher by employees when they get their call to come in to work. The employee's trainmaster usually conducts follow-up inquiries to learn why the employee has booked sick. Employees are expected to inform CN of their unavailability due to illness as soon as possible. Tardy notifications cause logistic difficulties for CN, which in turn result in train delays.\n[15] While Mr. Audet was out on his overnight run, Mr. Nadon heard about his seizure from some of the other CN employees at Capreol. Mr. Nadon invited Mr. Audet into his office as soon as he returned to Capreol. When asked by Mr. Nadon directly if the rumour was true, Mr. Audet confirmed that he had indeed experienced a seizure. Mr. Audet testified at the hearing that he had intended to tell CN about his seizure, but only after having first taken the opportunity to be examined by his own family physician and his neurologist.\nC. CN removes Mr. Audet from service [16] Mr. Nadon informed CN's department of Occupational Health Services (OHS) about the seizure. OHS's function within CN is to develop and monitor all policies with respect to health and fitness for duty. The medical component of OHS's functions has been assigned by CN to an outside firm, Medisys. The information provided by Mr. Nadon was reviewed by the Medisys team of health professionals, who in turn sent a message to CN's Crew Management Office directing that Mr. Audet be pulled out of service immediately and not be assigned to work on any more runs, as he was considered unfit for work in his position.\n[17] Medisys' determination was based on the Railway Association of Canada's Medical Guidelines for the Employment of Individuals with Epilepsy or Other Epileptic Seizures in a Safety Critical Position in the Canadian Railway Industry (the RAC Guidelines). According to Transport Canada's Railway Rules Governing Safety Critical Positions, which were developed pursuant to s. 20 of the Railway Safety Act, R.S., 1985, c. 32 (4th Supp.), safety critical positions are defined as any positions directly engaged in the operation of trains in main track or yard service, or engaged in rail traffic control. CN considers brakemen and conductors as falling into this category.\n[18] The Railway Medical Rules for Positions Critical to Safe Railway Operations (the Railway Medical Rules) also developed by Transport Canada pursuant to s. 20 of the Railway Safety Act, require that persons working in safety critical positions be assessed by their employers in regard to their medical fitness for duty. If a railway company's Chief Medical Officer, in making an individual assessment of a person's medical fitness for duty, is of the opinion that there exists a threat to safe railway operations, that person may be restricted from occupying a safety critical position, or be otherwise restricted from working or performing certain tasks in a safety critical position (Rule 6.1).\n[19] The RAC Guidelines reaffirm the principle espoused in Transport Canada's Railway Medical Rules that employees working in safety critical positions must be physically and mentally fit. They underscore the fact that impaired performance due to a medical condition could result in an incident affecting the health and safety of employees, the public, property or the environment. Section 4 of the RAC Guidelines sets out a series of criteria to be considered in assessing medical fitness for duty. In the case of someone diagnosed with epilepsy who has been treated with antiepileptic drugs, the criteria specify that the person must not have experienced any seizures for a period of five years. Also, the person must not exhibit any epileptiform activity in a series of electroencephalograms (EEGs) performed over the same period.\n[20] Upon learning of Mr. Audet's September 2002 seizure, and based on these criteria, CN immediately decided that his removal from service in any safety critical position would remain in effect for the five year evaluation period. He was effectively removed from his position of brakeman\/conductor for a period of five years.\n[21] As of October 2005, when the hearing before the Tribunal into Mr. Audet's human rights complaint took place, he had yet to be called back into service by CN, be it in a safety critical or non-safety critical position. He was in receipt of disability benefits until the end of June 2005. CN has not formally dismissed Mr. Audet.\n[22] Mr. Audet experienced three more seizures after the seizure of September 10, 2002, (one each in June, September, and November 2003). After the last of these seizures, his medication was changed and he has not had any seizures since.\nD. Mr. Audet's dealings with CN following his removal from service [23] Mr. Audet testified that following his removal from service, he was frequently in contact with Medisys. He signed a form authorizing Medisys to view his hospital records. On November 1, 2002, his neurologist completed a form issued by the Railway Association of Canada, relating to the evaluation of epilepsy or isolated epileptic seizures in individuals occupying safety critical positions. The form is essentially a medical report. Mr. Audet passed the form on to Medisys.\n[24] About one week after being released from service, Mr. Audet contacted his union representative, Glenn King, to report the seizure incident and to look into how he could be accommodated in his employment. Mr. Audet testified that after being removed from service, he would still visit the Capreol facility on a regular basis, asking CN management personnel there if they could accommodate him in another position. One of the persons he spoke to was Brian Gillies, a trainmaster at the Capreol facility. Mr. Audet claims that Mr. Gillies advised him to contact CN's management offices in Toronto to inquire about the possibilities for accommodation. Mr. Audet followed his suggestion and telephoned the Toronto office many times between 2002 and 2005. He was always told that someone would look into his situation and get back to him to discuss his case. No one ever did.\n[25] After September 12, 2002, Mr. Nadon never spoke to Mr. Audet again about his employment or any accommodation. According to Mr. Nadon, it was not his responsibility to engage in such discussions. That was the task of CN's human resources department and CN's risk management office.\n[26] Mr Audet was frequently in touch by telephone with June Sheppard, a registered nurse working for Medisys, who was handling Mr. Audet's file. Mr. Audet kept her up to date with respect to his medical condition, including the three seizures that he experienced in 2003. He testified that he frequently asked her what could be done about accommodating him. She always said that she would look into the matter, but he was never given any information about the outcome of her inquiries.\n[27] As the months passed, Mr. Audet claims that he did not get any response from CN, so on August 21, 2003, he filed the present human rights complaint alleging that he had not been accommodated.\nE. CN invites Mr. Audet to be tested for the position of Intermodal Dispatch Coordinator - December 2003 [28] According to Mr. Audet, it was only in December 2003, almost four months after filing his human rights complaint, that he first received any word from CN regarding accommodation. Richard Theberge, who was CN's Risk Management Officer for the Northern Ontario Zone, contacted Mr. Audet requesting that he attend an interview and complete a test for a bilingual intermodal dispatch coordinator position at Toronto's MacMillan facility. Mr. Audet was not consulted in advance about this position. His views about his suitability for the job were never sought. Nonetheless, as Mr. Theberge noted in a follow-up memo to Mr. King, Mr. Audet seemed eager to attend the interview and participate in the testing.\n[29] Mr. Audet travelled to Toronto to be interviewed and tested. He testified that he was given a general aptitude test to complete, containing elements that he described as clerical or secretarial. For instance, his typing skills were assessed. Mr. Audet had no previous work experience in any positions that required such skills. He had trouble with the testing, but not just because it related to areas in which he lacked experience and skill. He claims that he was also feeling headaches and pressure around his eyes that day. He was having trouble focussing on the questions, even though he could tell that some of them were simple. His hands were trembling.\n[30] His test results were very poor, falling between the first and fifth percentiles. The minimum score required for this type of position was the 25th percentile. He was therefore not offered the job. The person who administered the test wrote in her follow-up report to CN's human resources department that Mr. Audet had remarked a number of times during the testing that he felt the medication he was taking at the time was affecting his performance.\n[31] Shortly after the testing, a different neurologist took over Mr. Audet's treatment, and immediately changed the dosages of the medication being administered. On February 28, 2004, the neurologist wrote a note, which was forwarded to Medisys, stating that Mr. Audet's difficulties during the testing were related to his medication at the time. The neurologist urged CN to consider re-administering the test since those difficulties had now been resolved. Mr. Audet testified that CN did not react in any way to the note. He did not receive any offer of additional testing until May 2005, some five months after the Commission had referred the human rights complaint to the Tribunal.\nF. CN offers Mr. Audet the position of Train Movement Clerk - July 2004 [32] On July 19, 2004, Mr. Theberge sent a letter to Mr. Audet offering him the position of Train Movement Clerk (TMC) at the Administrative Building in MacMillan. Mr. Theberge noted that the job was being offered pursuant to CN's Disability Management Program. The position involved sedentary work, which would be supervised by the Program's Return to Work team, made up of Medisys nurses and doctors, as well as kinesiologists. Attached to the letter was a description of the physical demands and working conditions associated with the position. It indicates that a TMC may spend up to three hours per shift driving a vehicle.\n[33] On July 21, 2004, Mr. Audet replied in writing to Mr. Theberge's letter. Mr. Audet explained that he did not possess a valid driver's licence at the time. Following his seizure of November 2003, the Ontario Ministry of Transport had suspended Mr. Audet's driver's licence, on the advice of his neurologist. He was not eligible to regain his licence until early in 2005. Mr. Audet added in his reply that he hoped Mr. Theberge can take these factors into consideration. Mr. Audet concluded his letter by providing his telephone number and asking Mr. Theberge to contact him if he had any questions.\n[34] Mr. Audet testified that he did not get a response to his letter, so he placed a call to Mr. Theberge. They spoke on October 4, 2004. According to Mr. Audet, Mr. Theberge claimed, during their conversation, that CN had waived the driving requirement in Mr. Audet's case, and that Mr. Audet has been notified of this waiver previously. Mr. Audet replied to Mr. Theberge that on the contrary, he had never been informed of any such waiver. Mr. Audet then asked, if indeed the driving requirement had been waived, whether the position was still available. Mr. Theberge answered that it was not.\nG. CN invites Mr. Audet to undergo clerical testing - May 2005 [35] CN did not contact Mr. Audet again about employment possibilities until May 2005. CN invited him back to MacMillan Yard in Toronto to undergo testing. Suzanne Fusco, CN's human resources manager for Eastern Canada, testified that this was simply clerical testing, which did not relate to any specific position. The testing was administered on May 25, 2005, and according to Mr. Audet, it concentrated on secretarial skills even more than the first round of testing in December 2003. Typing ability was again assessed, and many portions of the testing were timed. Several weeks afterwards, Mr. Audet received a call from a representative of CN informing him that he had performed poorly on the test, without giving any further details. No follow-up report of the results was provided to him.\nH. CN offers Mr. Audet the Rule 42 Foreman position - October 13, 2005 [36] On October 13, 2005, just four days before the Tribunal began its hearing into the complaint, legal counsel for CN sent a letter to Mr. Audet's counsel stating that CN had an employment position available that could accommodate his various restrictions. The position is called a Rule 42 foreman, and the work location was to be in the Greater Toronto Area and in the Great Lakes District. Some testing would be required before Mr. Audet could obtain the position.\n[37] On October 14, 2005, Mr. Audet's counsel replied that the position was unsatisfactory. The work location was a great distance from his home terminal in Capreol, at substantially less pay than he formerly enjoyed. There was also some concern that the hours and duties of the job may be in violation of Mr. Audet's restrictions, established by CN's Chief Medical Officer in 1997. In addition, it was a position that fell into another bargaining unit, which was represented by a different union than the UTU. His ability to keep his seniority rights would depend on the cooperation of the new union. Mr. Audet's counsel underscored his client's reasonable expectation that CN would make greater efforts to accommodate his disability. But it was also pointed out that Mr. Audet was not refusing the offer of employment outright.\n[38] By the close of the hearing, Mr. Audet had not as yet formally rejected the offer, but during final submissions, Mr. Audet's counsel reiterated his above mentioned reservations regarding the position being offered.\nII. WHAT MUST BE PROVEN TO ESTABLISH DISCRIMINATION IN THIS CASE? [39] It is a discriminatory practice to refuse to continue to employ an individual on the basis of his or her disability (s. 3 and s. 7 of the Act). A disability is defined in s. 25 of the Act as any previous or existing mental or physical disability. This definition has been interpreted to mean any physical or mental impairment that results in a functional limitation, or that is associated with a perception of impairment (see Desormeaux v. Corporation of the City of Ottawa 2005 FCA 311 at para. 15). CN unquestionably perceives Mr. Audet's epilepsy, which resulted in his experiencing seizures, as impairing his ability to function in a safety-critical position. I am satisfied therefore that his condition constitutes a disability within the meaning of the Act.\n[40] The employer's conduct will not be considered discriminatory if it can establish that its refusal in relation to any employment is based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) (s. 15(1) of the Act). For any practice to be considered a BFOR, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of the individual or class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost (s. 15(2) of the Act).\n[41] The Supreme Court of Canada articulated the approach to be followed in determining whether a BFOR has been established in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin). The complainant has the initial burden of establishing that the standard or policy adopted by the respondent is prima facie discriminatory.\n[42] Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the respondent may justify the impugned standard by establishing the following, on the balance of probabilities:\nThe respondent adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; The respondent adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose; The standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, the respondent must demonstrate that it is impossible to accommodate the complainant without imposing undue hardship on the respondent. It is incumbent on the respondent to show that it considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 (Grismer)).\nA. The Prima facie case [43] Although CN never formally dismissed Mr. Audet, it unquestionably pulled him from service as a brakeman or conductor immediately after learning of the seizure that he experienced on September 10, 2002. CN decided to restrict Mr. Audet from his position for a period of five years, after which he could return, provided he remained seizure-free. CN did not assign him to any other position or duties in the meantime.\n[44] I am satisfied that Mr. Audet has established prima facie that CN effectively refused to continue to employ him, on the basis of his disability. It is therefore incumbent upon CN to establish that its refusal to employ Mr. Audet was justified.\nB. CN's justification [45] CN contends that its standard and ensuing course of conduct were justified. In light of Mr. Audet's significant medical restrictions, which included not only those related to his epilepsy but to his back injury as well, CN claims that it was unable to individually accommodate him without incurring undue hardship.\nC. Application of the Meoirin test (i) Was the standard adopted by CN for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job? [46] CN considers the positions of brakeman and conductor as safety critical. These workers are directly engaged in the operation of a train. As indicated in the RAC Guidelines, if the performance of persons in safety critical positions is impaired due to a medical condition, it could result in a significant incident affecting the health and safety of employees, the public, property or the environment. Individuals who hold such safety critical positions are therefore required to be medically fit to perform their duties.\n[47] CN applied a standard that it derived from the RAC Guidelines, according to which, in cases like Mr. Audet's, where epilepsy is being treated by antiepileptic drugs, an employee will be considered medically fit for a safety critical position if he or she has been free of seizures for a period of five years. The employee is subject to ongoing monitoring of his or her condition.\n[48] In my view, there is an obvious rational connection between the purpose of avoiding incidents affecting the health and safety of employees, the public, property or the environment, and the performance of the jobs of brakeman and conductor. The safe operation of the rail system is certainly a concern for CN. The prevention of an incident that could affect the health and safety of employees or the public is rationally connected to the performance of such safety critical jobs.\n(ii) Did CN adopt the standard in the good faith belief that it was necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose? [49] I am satisfied that CN adopted this standard in good faith, in the belief that it was necessary to ensure the safe operation of its rail system.\n(iii) Has it been demonstrated that the accommodation of Mr. Audet is impossible without imposing undue hardship on CN? [50] To show that a standard is reasonably necessary (the third step of the Meiorin test), an employer must demonstrate that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the complainant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\na) Was Mr. Audet individually assessed? [51] The Supreme Court, in Meiorin at paragraph 64, counsels courts and tribunals to be sensitive to the various ways in which the individual capabilities of employees may be accommodated. An employer should inquire into the possibility that there may be different ways to perform the job while still accomplishing the employer's legitimate work-related purpose. The skills, capabilities and potential contributions of the individual complainant and others like him or her must be respected as much as possible.\n[52] These considerations are also reflected in the RAC Guidelines themselves. While s. 4 of the RAC Guidelines provides the general criteria for medical fitness in cases of epilepsy, s. 6 specifies that the employer should not conclude that an individual is unfit for duty without having first conducted an individual assessment with regard to the individual's particular position:\n6. Individual assessment\nIndividuals with epilepsy or other epileptic seizures must be assessed with regard to their suitability for a particular position. The nature of the duties and responsibilities associated with their specific Safety Critical Position must be closely evaluated before any final determination of their fitness for duty.\n[53] What efforts did CN make to individually assess Mr. Audet regarding his suitability to work as a brakeman or conductor? There was no evidence of any attempt by CN to make any such assessment until December 10, 2003, almost four months after Mr. Audet had filed his human rights complaint with the Commission, and precisely 15 months after experiencing his seizure. On that date, Dr. Claude Lapierre, CN's Chief Medical Officer, wrote a letter to Dr. Guy R\u00e9millard, a neurologist in Montreal, asking his professional opinion on the nature of the seizure disorder that [Mr. Audet] is suffering from and [Dr. R\u00e9millard's] recommendation on his fitness for duty in a safety critical position.\n[54] Dr. R\u00e9millard did not meet or examine Mr. Audet personally, nor was he asked to do so. Jackie Anderson, a nurse on CN's Medisys team, testified that the standard protocol is to conduct a paper review of the medical condition of an employee with epilepsy. The assessment is made based on information from the employee's treating physicians and specialists. Ms. Anderson added that the assessment is usually made in consultation with CN's Chief Medical Officer. In some complex cases such as Mr. Audet's, the advice of a specialist on the medical condition is sought, in order to determine if Medisys' assessment is correct.\n[55] After reviewing the file, Dr. R\u00e9millard discussed the matter with Dr. Lapierre, who in turn documented the content of their conversation in a follow-up e-mail message to Ms. Sheppard at Medisys. Apparently, at the core of the two physicians' discussions was the question of whether Mr. Audet's seizure was provoked by the deprivation of sleep associated with the requirements of his position. The RAC Guidelines provide that where the seizure is provoked, the employee can be deemed fit for duty in a safety critical position as early as one year following the seizure. In Dr. R\u00e9millard's opinion, Mr. Audet's seizure was not provoked by sleep deprivation but came about instead as a recurrence of his epilepsy. Thus, as a person with epilepsy who had experienced a seizure, Mr. Audet was not fit to work in a safety critical position for a period of five years, based on s. 4 of the RAC Guidelines.\n[56] There is no evidence to indicate, however, whether Dr. Lapierre or Dr. R\u00e9millard ever closely evaluated the nature of the duties and responsibilities associated with Mr. Audet's specific safety critical position, as provided for in s. 6 of the RAC Guidelines. Instead, based on the finding that the seizure was not provoked, Dr. Lapierre apparently felt that no further inquiry was warranted and he sent Mr. Audet's file back to Medisys.\n[57] I am not persuaded, from the evidence adduced in this case, that CN made any efforts to individually assess Mr. Audet with a view to determining whether his medical condition prevented him from performing his duties and responsibilities in his positions of brakeman and conductor. CN's sights seemed focussed on determining whether it was responsible for having provoked Mr. Audet's seizure due to of his workload over the summer of 2002. In this respect, it is very telling that one of Dr. Lapierre's final remarks in his e-mail is that Mr. Audet has very little chance of convincing any tribunal that he only had provoked seizure [sic]. There is no mention about whether Mr. Audet, as an individual, could still safely perform his job, and if not, how he could be accommodated.\n[58] There may be an additional explanation for why CN's attention was drawn to the question of whether the seizure was provoked by his workload, apart from the need to determine whether Mr. Audet's removal for service should be for one year or five. Evidence was led with respect to a prolonged dispute at the time between CN and the UTU about the workload of running trades employees, including brakemen and conductors. The debate centred on the employees' right to book rest periods after their runs. The UTU had taken the position that the employer had been pressuring its employees not to exercise this right to the fullest extent, with the objective of making them available sooner to take on their next run. The employer disagreed and argued that it was merely preventing excessive and abusive booking of rest periods by some employees. I suspect that these lingering issues may have influenced CN in the positions that it adopted following Mr. Audet's seizure, and may help explain why CN seemed so concerned with ensuring that it had not provoked the seizure, rather than concentrating on accommodating its employee.\n[59] Whatever CN's motives may have been, the fact is that there is no evidence of any individual assessment of Mr. Audet having been conducted in order to determine his suitability for his specific safety critical position. It is apparent to me that once CN learned that he had experienced an epileptic seizure, it applied the criteria set out in s. 4 of the RAC Guidelines in a routine, mechanical fashion, without any consideration of his individual circumstances or condition. CN simply decided that Mr. Audet would be restricted from working in his safety critical position for a five-year period, without any further examination into his individual suitability for his position.\n[60] CN contends that it was not necessary to assess Mr. Audet's individual suitability. The nature of a brakeman's and conductor's duties are such that any person who experiences an epileptic seizure, like Mr. Audet, is immediately medically unfit to perform these safety critical duties.\n[61] I am not persuaded by this argument. To permit an employer to invoke opinions about its employees' disabilities that it views as somehow self-evident, would hand to the employer too facile a justification for conduct that may be otherwise discriminatory. As the Supreme Court noted in Grismer at paragraph 19, the reason why accommodation must be incorporated into a standard is to ensure that each person is assessed according to his or her own personal abilities, instead of being judged against presumed group characteristics, which are frequently based on bias and historical prejudice. An individual assessment of the employee is therefore an essential step in the accommodation process (see Grismer at paras. 22 and 30; Meiorin at para. 65).\nb) Did the employer consider and reasonably reject all viable forms of accommodation? [62] Even if CN's opinion regarding the necessity to conduct an individual assessment in Mr. Audet's case was valid, however, the question that would still have to be addressed is whether CN, having determined that Mr. Audet was medically unfit to work in his position, considered and reasonably rejected all other viable ways of accommodating him. In my opinion, CN has failed to establish that it satisfied this requirement.\n[63] Mr. Audet testified that he and Mr. King had repeatedly asked CN to cooperate with him in finding some sort of accommodation that would allow him to return to work at CN. These attempts were in fact documented in the log that Ms. Sheppard kept of activity in Mr. Audet's Medisys file. As early as September 17, 2002, Ms. Sheppard noted, after having spoken to Mr. Audet, that he was concerned about the future outcome of his case and his ability to work. There are several references to Ms. Sheppard's conversations with Mr. King regarding his attempts at contacting CN to find Mr. Audet some form of accommodation. Ms. Anderson testified that she had reviewed the notes in Mr. Audet's file and she agreed that he had definitely spoken to Ms. Sheppard about having his disability accommodated.\n[64] How did CN react to these requests? What efforts did it make to accommodate Mr. Audet? CN has established certain guidelines that are to be followed when accommodating employees with special needs (the Accommodation Guidelines), excerpts of which are found in Tab 31 of Exhibit C-1. The Accommodation Guidelines provide that even where the supervisors and managers of the employee are aware that the employee needs to be accommodated, they have a responsibility to initiate the procedure for accommodation, even if the employee has not requested it (para. 7.12.3). CN's managers and supervisors were obviously aware of Mr. Audet's need for accommodation; it was they who had removed him from his job in the first place because, in their view, his disability rendered him unfit to work in a safety critical position.\n[65] What procedures for accommodation did CN initiate? Paragraph 7.12.4 of the Accommodation Guidelines provides that the first thing for the employer to do is to meet with the individual employee and allow him or her to present the problem or need. The employer representative should ask questions to the employee in order to fully understand the request, and both persons should then together discuss possible solutions.\n[66] Mr. Audet's evidence in this regard is uncontroverted. No CN representative met with him at any time, let alone as the first thing, to discuss his disability, ask questions, or discuss possible solutions. Mr. Audet sought as much information and assistance as he could obtain from CN, but it was all to no avail. After removing him from service, Mr. Nadon never spoke to Mr. Audet again about his job or any form of accommodation. Another trainmaster, Mr. Gillies, redirected Mr. Audet's inquiries to CN's Toronto office. The Toronto office promised to call Mr. Audet back, but did not.\n[67] In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that CN ever discussed with Mr. Audet the possibilities for his accommodation at any time prior to his filing the human rights complaint in August 2003. Some four months after the human rights complaint was filed, the risk management officer, Mr. Theberge, finally contacted Mr. Audet, but not to seek his input on the disability or to discuss possible solutions, pursuant to the Accommodation Guidelines. Mr. Theberge telephoned Mr. Audet to present him with just one option - come to Toronto to be interviewed and tested for one specific position. There was no discussion with Mr. Audet about whether he had any of the skills or qualifications to work in a clerical position, like dispatch coordinator.\n[68] Although this was the first accommodation option to actually be presented to Mr. Audet, did CN at least examine other accommodation possibilities prior to this point, albeit without the knowledge of Mr. Audet? The evidence indicates that CN's efforts, even in this respect, were minimal at best.\n[69] Ms. Anderson, the Medisys team leader, explained that it is not the responsibility of Medisys to find an accommodated position for disabled CN employees. The Medisys team's role in this regard is merely to contact CN's human resources department, the risk management officer and the employee's supervisors, to place a request that an accommodated position be found for the employee.\n[70] As I mentioned earlier, Ms. Sheppard, who had charge of Mr. Audet's Medisys file, kept a log documenting the activity in his file. Ms. Sheppard did not testify at the hearing. Her initial entries in the log following Mr. Audet's removal from service relate to the various documents and other information gathered with respect to his medical condition as well as the treatments and medication he was receiving. CN acknowledges that Mr. Audet always provided Medisys with all requested medical and other documents without delay.\n[71] Ms. Sheppard's log documents the numerous communications with CN initiated by Mr. Audet, Mr. King and herself, requesting accommodation for Mr. Audet. The requests were ultimately to no avail.\n[72] On November 13, 2002, Ms. Sheppard wrote in her log about a discussion she had with a risk management officer regarding the need to find an alternate position for Mr. Audet, given his restriction from working in a safety critical position for five years. On December 4, 2002, she recorded in her log that she had sent an e-mail message to the risk management officer, in which she reminded him of Mr. Audet's restriction to non-safety critical work and requested that he check if any accommodation [is] available.\n[73] On February 26, 2003, Ms. Sheppard apparently spoke about Mr. Audet's case to a senior adjudicator of the Great West Life Assurance Company, which was CN's disability benefits provider. Ms. Sheppard noted that the adjudicator undertook to contact CN and request if there was a non-safety critical position that Mr. Audet could fill.\n[74] A few days later, Ms. Sheppard made a similar effort herself. She recorded in her log that she sent an e-mail to the human resources department, the risk management officer, the Director of the OHS department and Mr. Audet's immediate supervisor, advising them of Mr. Audet's restrictions and current benefit status. She requested feedback from them on any possible job offers. There is no indication in Ms. Sheppard's log of whether anyone responded to this request, nor was there evidence led at the hearing of any such response.\n[75] On March 14, 2003, Mr. Audet apparently telephoned Ms. Sheppard. She recorded in her log that she advised him to ask CN directly if there were any non-safety critical positions available for him. One day later, on March 15, 2003, Ms. Sheppard noted that she had a discussion with Mr. King, the UTU representative, who told her that he would try to assist Mr. Audet in being accommodated somewhere at CN.\n[76] By July 30, 2003, however, it is obvious that the accommodation issue had not been resolved. Ms. Sheppard wrote that she had discussed again with Mr. King the matter of accommodating Mr. Audet. Mr. King said that he was going to speak to the risk management officer about the issue.\n[77] The results were evidently not fruitful. On September 15, 2003, Ms. Sheppard wrote that she had spoken on several occasions to Mr. King again, regarding the possibility of accommodation from CN, adding that there had been no response from the company.\n[78] On November 10, 2003, Ms. Sheppard wrote that she again spoke to Mr. King, who told her that he was trying to contact Mr. Theberge, the risk management officer, regarding the possible accommodation of Mr. Audet.\n[79] On November 18, 2003, Ms. Sheppard received an e-mail message from Paul Bourque, who was the human resources manager for Mr. Audet's area. The e-mail was also sent to several other persons, including Mr. Theberge, Mr. Nadon, and workers' compensation coordinator Louise Smolska. Mr. Bourque informed them that Mr. Audet had filed a human rights complaint. In order to prepare a response to the Commission, Mr. Bourque asked them to provide any information regarding their efforts to accommodate Mr. Audet since September 11, 2002, and in particular, to indicate any jobs that had been identified for accommodation.\n[80] Ms. Smolska's reply to Mr. Bourque's e-mail message was produced at the hearing. She said that no jobs were identified from her group. There is no evidence of any reply from the other persons who received Mr. Bourque's e-mail message.\n[81] On December 5, 2003, Mr. Bourque sent an e-mail message to several individuals within CN, who were involved with Mr. Audet's case, advising them that two positions had been found (Dispatch Coordinator and TRS Clerk) that were suitable for someone with his restrictions. Mr. Bourque requested that plans be made to have Mr. Audet tested for these positions. There is no indication if Mr. Audet or Mr. King were consulted in any way before this decision was made. The testing referred to in the e-mail message was the testing administered to Mr. Audet in Toronto in December 2003, in respect of which he did not obtain a passing mark, due in part, he claims, to the dosage of his medication at the time.\n[82] On April 13, 2004, Ms. Sheppard sent an e-mail message to Mr. Theberge and others, conveying Mr. Audet's communication to her that his medical condition had stabilized and that he would be able to be more successful in testing. Ms. Sheppard asked if there was any possibility of accommodating him in a non-safety critical position. Mr. Theberge simply replied that as far as any other position [is concerned], there is nothing available in Capreol.\n[83] What evidence is there of CN's attempts, if any, to find Mr. Audet work at his home terminal in Capreol? Mr. Nadon testified that he was not familiar with the requirement in CN's Accommodation Guidelines that the employee's managers meet with him to discuss the problem and possible solutions. Mr. Nadon acknowledged that no such meeting took place. In Mr. Nadon's view, accommodating Mr. Audet was the responsibility of the human resources department and the risk management office.\n[84] Mr. Nadon recalled that he was contacted to see if we had any work or position available for [Mr. Audet] and we had nothing in our department. He added that Medisys and the human resources department had approached him to see if we had any duties that could accommodate Mr. Audet. In light of the restrictions that prevented Mr. Audet from working in safety critical positions, Mr. Nadon said, We knew we could not modify the position [of brakeman or conductor] to accommodate him. That was obvious. He did not consider providing training to Mr. Audet that would enable him to become qualified to work in positions for which he was not yet qualified. He did not consider taking a number of tasks from several positions and bundling them together to create a new position, to accommodate Mr. Audet. Mr. Nadon acknowledged that in sum, his role in accommodating Mr. Audet was to keep his eyes open for any potential vacancies at Capreol that would respect Mr. Audet's restrictions.\n[85] Mr. Nadon's limited role in accommodating Mr. Audet raises an additional issue. In Meiorin, the Court alluded to the practical usefulness, in conducting the accommodation analysis, of considering the appropriateness of the procedure that the employer adopted to assess the issue of accommodation (see Meorin at para. 37).\n[86] The evidence supports Mr. Audet's submission that CN failed to even observe the procedures outlined in its own Accommodation Guidelines, and, in so doing, neglected to accommodate him procedurally. For instance, neither Mr. Nadon nor anyone else at CN met with Mr. Audet to discuss his disability and explore possible solutions, as indicated in the Accommodation Guidelines.\n[87] The Accommodation Guidelines also state that it is extremely important to keep records of these meetings with the employee, the various solutions proposed and the arguments used to accept or reject each option. There are of course no records of any meetings with Mr. Audet, as none were ever held. CN did not, however, even produce satisfactory records regarding solutions that CN may have analyzed internally and rejected on its own, without Mr. Audet's involvement.\n[88] Ms. Fusco filed in evidence an engineering bulletin, dated October 17, 2005. It consists of a list that sets out the available positions in the Great Lakes region of Ontario, at the time of the hearing. Mr. Audet contends that he could have been accommodated in the flag person position, which was available at that time. CN argues that none of the positions on the list were suitable for Mr. Audet. For instance, the flag person position involves regular overtime work, which would have been in breach of his restrictions.\n[89] It is, however, noteworthy that CN did not produce any engineering bulletin or similar report from any point prior to October 2005. There is no document in evidence demonstrating that following Mr. Audet's removal from service, CN looked at and analyzed any positions other than the TMC and Dispatch Coordinator positions. Furthermore, even if any other positions were in fact considered during this time, there was no record produced documenting the reasons why they were ultimately rejected.\n[90] CN's Accommodation Guidelines state that one way in which the employer can accommodate disabled employees, without creating undue hardship, is by providing them special training [...] to reintegrate into the workforce. CN never offered Mr. Audet the possibility of retraining. Ms. Fusco claims that CN would have offered Mr. Audet training for the dispatcher position, had he passed the initial testing phase. But I have found that the testing was centred on clerical skills, which he clearly lacked. He needed training in those very clerical skills being assessed, which would in turn have given him a better chance at passing the qualifying tests for the alternative positions. Ms. Fusco acknowledged in her evidence that the union representing the employees in the dispatcher positions would not have objected to Mr. Audet's getting training prior to testing.\n[91] In my view, these are just a few examples that demonstrate how CN did not accommodate Mr. Audet procedurally, having failed to even conform to the basic provisions laid out in CN's own Accommodation Guidelines.\n[92] Overall, therefore, what accommodation efforts did CN make in the three-year period between the occurrence of the seizure on September 10, 2002, and the start of the hearing, on October 17, 2005? CN put forth a total of four proposals for the accommodation of Mr. Audet's disability:\nDecember 2003 - An invitation to complete a test that would enable Mr. Audet to qualify for the position of intermodal dispatch coordinator at MacMillan Yard in Toronto. July 2004 - An offer of a Train Movement Clerk position at MacMillan Yard in Toronto. May 2005 - An invitation to undergo clerical testing. October 2005 - An offer of a Rule 42 Foreman position at MacMillan Yard in Toronto.\n[93] Do these efforts demonstrate that CN considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation? In my view, the answer is no.\n[94] Ms. Fusco was called by CN to testify as to its efforts to accommodate Mr. Audet. In her examination in chief, she stated that CN had actively looked for any suitable vacancies from September 2002 onwards. Yet, in cross-examination, she confirmed that she was not involved in any attempts to accommodate him prior to 2004, so she could not really speak to any previous accommodation efforts. She also acknowledged that she had not kept records or notes of accommodation efforts in which she did participate. Mr. Nadon, as I have already mentioned, testified that he did not make any real attempts at accommodating Mr. Audet other than basically keeping his eyes open for vacant positions. In Mr. Nadon's view, it was up to the human resources department and the risk management officer to arrange for Mr. Audet's accommodation.\n[95] CN did not consider offering training to Mr. Audet to enable him to qualify for other positions. There is no evidence that CN considered re-bundling a number of job tasks to enhance employment opportunities for Mr. Audet.\n[96] Yet, CN still argues that between 2002 and 2005, the positions that were offered to him were the only jobs that Mr. Audet could have filled, given his restrictions, which included the WSIB restrictions relating to his 1995 back injury.\n[97] As recently as July 2005, however, the UTU proposed a number of positions to CN for which Mr. Audet was qualified and which were consistent with his WSIB restrictions as well as the restrictions related to his epilepsy. These positions included those of Utility Person and Fire\/Safety Watch. CN contended at the hearing that these positions were no longer available when the UTU proposed them. CN did not, however, explain why they were not offered to Mr. Audet when they were available.\n[98] One of the other positions that the UTU proposed in 2005 was that of Traffic Coordinator. Ms. Fusco testified that Mr. Audet could not be assigned to this position because it was considered to be safety critical. She acknowledged, however, that CN gave no consideration to modifying the duties of this position to conform to Mr. Audet's restrictions. She acknowledged that CN has in the past modified safety critical positions to accommodate an employee's restrictions.\n[99] One employee in particular was diagnosed with epilepsy while employed with CN in the safety critical position of conductor, just like Mr. Audet. As a form of accommodation, CN assigned him to the safety critical position of traffic controller at the Capreol terminal. His duties were modified to accommodate him. Traffic controllers belong to the same UTU bargaining unit as Mr. Audet.\n[100] In my view, it is evident that many viable forms of accommodation were left unexplored by CN in Mr. Audet's case. Moreover, it is clear that what little exploration CN did engage in commenced only after the human rights complaint was filed by Mr. Audet in August 2003. Prior to this point, the efforts made to accommodate him were essentially non-existent.\n[101] Counsel for CN suggested in his final submissions that CN's delay in initiating its efforts to accommodate Mr. Audet was due to the uncertainty related to the nature of his disability. Until Dr. Lapierre's opinion was obtained, it was not clear whether or not Mr. Audet had experienced a provoked seizure.\n[102] This uncertainty is, however, beside the point. Whether or not the seizure was provoked, the fact is that as of September 12, 2002, CN had removed Mr. Audet from service because of his disability. From that moment forward, CN had a duty to actively seek out ways to accommodate its employee. A delay was not justified. If CN needed to learn what the implications of Mr. Audet's epilepsy and seizure were, it could have started by at least meeting and discussing his situation with him. Mr. Audet had supplied Medisys with his medical file. CN had more than sufficient information to commence its accommodation efforts. Besides, the basic restriction imposed on Mr. Audet was that he not be employed in safety critical positions. CN could easily have begun searching for non-safety critical work for him to perform. Yet, there is no evidence of any such attempts prior to December 2003.\nc) Would accommodating Mr. Audet have imposed undue hardship on CN? [103] Although I have found that several options for Mr. Audet's accommodation were not considered by CN, s. 15(2) of the Act provides that an employer may nonetheless justify its refusal to employ an individual by showing that accommodating the individual's needs would impose undue hardship on it, considering health, safety and cost. CN argued that health and safety concerns prevented Mr. Audet from working in any safety critical positions. Assuming that these concerns are legitimate, on what basis does CN argue that accommodating Mr. Audet, in a manner that would not place him in a safety critical position, would impose undue hardship? How would bundling several non-safety critical job tasks into one position or offering Mr. Audet retraining, for instance, impose undue hardship on CN, based on the only consideration still available under s. 15(2), cost?\n[104] There is no evidence before me of the cost implications of offering these forms of accommodation to Mr. Audet. Ms. Fusco testified that in Mr. Audet's case, money or cost was not a barrier to CN's accommodating him. Mr. Audet filed into evidence a Canadian Press wire story from the July 21, 2005, edition of the North Bay Nugget newspaper, which reported that CN's profit in the first six months of 2005 had surged to $715 million, up from $536 million for the same period in 2004. CN's revenues in the first half of 2005 were $3.54 billion. CN's president is quoted in the article as having said, Our employees are performing strongly and we expect to continue to deliver solid benefits to shareholders.\n[105] In Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489 at para. 62, the Supreme Court pointed out that the size of an employer's operation may influence the assessment of whether a given financial cost is undue. CN is certainly a large employer. Ms. Fusco indicated in her evidence that Medisys alone is responsible for 5,000 CN employees. CN has developed an internal infrastructure to address the particular needs of its employees. Formal guidelines have been adopted that give direction on how to accommodate those needs. Ms. Fusco testified that at any given time, Medisys is actively involved in the files of up to ten percent of those 5,000 employees.\n[106] It is incumbent upon CN to demonstrate in real, concrete terms how the costs associated with accommodating Mr. Audet would impose undue hardship on CN. The Supreme Court of Canada, in Grismer at paragraph 41, recognized that in some circumstances, excessive cost may justify a refusal to accommodate those with disabilities. Impressionistic evidence of increased expense will not, however, suffice. The Court cautioned that one must be wary of putting too low a value on accommodating the disabled, for it would be too easy to cite increased cost as a reason for refusing to accord the disabled equal treatment.\n[107] In the present case, there was essentially no evidence presented, impressionistic or otherwise, regarding the costs associated with accommodating Mr. Audet and their effect on CN and its operations. CN has not, therefore, established that accommodating Mr. Audet's needs would impose undue hardship on CN.\nd) Did Mr. Audet hinder CN's accommodation efforts? [108] CN claims that it has made all reasonable efforts to accommodate Mr. Audet and that it is his own inflexibility that has prevented a solution from being found. The Supreme Court of Canada, in Renaud v. Central Okanagan School District No. 23, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970 at paras. 43-44, stated that a complainant has a duty to facilitate the search for accommodation. Thus, in determining whether the duty to accommodate has been fulfilled, the conduct of the complainant must be considered. When an employer has initiated a proposal that is reasonable and would, if implemented, fulfill the duty to accommodate, the complainant has a duty to facilitate the implementation of the proposal. If failure to take reasonable steps on the part of the complainant causes the proposal to founder, the complaint will be dismissed.\n[109] What aspects of Mr. Audet's conduct allegedly demonstrate that he caused a reasonable proposal to founder?\n1. Mr. Audet's reaction to the July 2004 TMC job offer [110] Much was made of Mr. Audet's reaction to CN's July 2004 offer of the Train Movement Clerk position, at MacMillan Yard in Toronto. CN contends that this was a reasonable proposal, which Mr. Audet should have accepted. But did Mr. Audet refuse the offer in fact? He did not say that he was refusing it in his July 21, 2004, letter to Mr. Theberge. Mr. Audet simply disclosed the fact that he did not possess a driver's licence. The document setting out the physical demands and working conditions for the TMC position, which Mr. Theberge had sent to Mr. Audet, clearly stated that the position involved working in a vehicle (driving). The environmental conditions for the position stipulated that depending on tasks, [the employee] may spend up to 3 hrs [per 8-hour shift] in vehicle driving around yard.\n[111] In my view, it was perfectly reasonable for Mr. Audet, having viewed these working conditions related to the proposed position, to have alerted CN about a legal impediment to his performing the job duties. He was not being uncooperative. On the contrary, his disclosure of this fact to CN served to ensure that efforts would not be wasted in accommodating him in a job that he was legally prevented from performing. What good would it have done for Mr. Audet to have accepted the position, in the knowledge that he clearly lacked one of the necessary qualifications?\n[112] CN appeared to suggest that it had waived the requirement for a driver's licence in Mr. Audet's case, but CN led no evidence of its own to support this contention. Instead, it was Mr. Audet himself who reported in his testimony that Mr. Theberge had made this assertion during a telephone conversation with him in October 2004. Mr. Audet denies ever having been told that the requirement to drive had been waived in his case, until that October 2004 telephone conversation, when it was already too late. His evidence is uncontroverted. Mr. Theberge did not testify and there is no evidence to support this assertion.\n[113] If CN's intention had indeed been to waive the driving requirement, why did Mr. Theberge not simply write back to Mr. Audet and advise him that he was mistaken? In his letter, Mr. Audet had, after all, invited Mr. Theberge to contact him if there were any questions. Mr. Audet even provided his telephone number. Mr. Theberge did not show the courtesy to even place a call to Mr. Audet. I do not consider Mr. Audet's reaction to the July 2004 job offer to have caused the proposal to founder. If anything, the failure of the proposal is due to its inappropriateness as a form of accommodation, and CN's failure to respond and address the concern raised by Mr. Audet in his letter.\n2. The UTU's alleged failure to facilitate the accommodation [114] CN also argued in final submissions that the UTU had hindered the implementation of accommodation in Mr. Audet's case. Reference was made to the union's five proposals for possible accommodation put forward in July 2005. CN contends that the union did not make any similar proposals prior to this point, and that its failure to do so demonstrates somehow that the union (and by extension Mr. Audet) did not fulfill their duty in the search for his accommodation.\n[115] This argument is obviously based on a misreading of Renaud. The Supreme Court was quite clear in this regard. The duty on the complainant to do his or her part does not mean that the complainant has a duty to originate a solution. The employer is in the best position to determine how the complainant can be accommodated without imposing undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business. It is only once an employer has initiated a reasonable proposal that the complainant has a duty to facilitate its implementation (Renaud at para. 44).\n[116] How can the UTU and Mr. Audet be accused of failing to fulfill their duty to facilitate accommodation proposals when CN did not put forth a single accommodation proposal until December 2003, and did not make a single formal job offer until July 2004, almost two years after Mr. Audet was removed from service? I find it disingenuous on CN's part to suggest that Mr. Audet and the UTU were somehow tardy in addressing accommodation, when the evidence is clear that Mr. Audet and Mr. King had been imploring CN to engage in the accommodation process since 2002, while CN on the other hand had not shown any reaction or initiative whatsoever until well after Mr. Audet had filed his human rights complaint.\n3. Mr. Audet's reaction to the offer of the Rule 42 Foreman position [117] While CN may have failed to address the issue of accommodation for an extended period, can it nonetheless be argued that Mr. Audet's decision not to immediately accept CN's most recent offer (Rule 42 Foreman), made on October 13, 2005, constitutes a breach of his duty to facilitate the search for accommodation?\n[118] First of all, I am not certain that this offer sheds any light on the question of whether CN accommodated Mr. Audet to the point of undue hardship. It seems to me that this job offer should more appropriately be characterized as a settlement offer, coming as it did just days before the hearing commenced. Second, as of the last day of the hearing, Mr. Audet had not as yet formally rejected the offer. Furthermore, in my view, the concerns raised by Mr. Audet are not unreasonable. For instance, it was not abundantly apparent from CN's offer whether the job's working conditions satisfied Mr. Audet's work restrictions. Indeed, CN was itself only able to confirm on the very last day of the hearing that the position complied with his work restrictions.\n[119] Mr. Audet's reaction to the offer of the Rule 42 Foreman position is not in my view indicative of his having hindered CN's accommodation efforts.\nIII. FINDING OF DISCRIMINATION [120] For all these reasons, I find that Mr. Audet was removed from service on account of his disability, in breach of s.7 of the Act. CN has not established that its refusal to continue to employ Mr. Audet was justified based on a bona fide occupational requirement, pursuant to s. 15 of the Act. Mr. Audet's complaint has therefore been substantiated.\nIV. WHAT REMEDIES DOES MR. AUDET SEEK? A. An order that CN review its accommodation policy [121] Mr. Audet requests an order, pursuant to s. 53(2)(a) of the Act, that CN take measures, in consultation with the Commission, to redress its failure to properly accommodate its employees, as evidenced in his own case. Mr. Audet acknowledges that CN has a policy on accommodation, i.e. the Accommodation Guidelines, and that it may in fact be a good policy, but argues that it is clearly not being applied or implemented properly.\n[122] I have referred in my decision to the Accommodation Guidelines, and have determined that those at CN responsible for their implementation indeed failed to follow them in Mr. Audet's case. In my view, Mr. Audet's request is justified.\n[123] I therefore order CN to take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to review its accommodation policy and ensure that it is complied with by the individuals and groups responsible for its implementation.\nB. Return to active service [124] Mr. Audet seeks an order, pursuant to s. 53(2)(b) of the Act, directing CN to return him to active service in his position of brakeman\/conductor, with any necessary modifications to the duties of that position that would allow him to perform his job safely and within his restrictions. There is evidence that other employees in similar circumstances have been accommodated, including a Capreol employee with epilepsy who was accommodated with modified duties in his otherwise safety critical position.\n[125] After learning of Mr. Audet's seizure in September 2002, CN applied the RAC Guidelines in a mechanical fashion, and removed Mr. Audet from service without assessing his individual medical fitness to work in his specific position, as provided for in the RAC Guidelines and CN's Accommodation Guidelines. Section 53(2)(b) of the Act states that where the Tribunal finds the complaint is substantiated, it may order a respondent to make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that were denied the victim as a result of the practice.\n[126] In order to provide this remedy in the present case, Mr. Audet must first be returned to his job. I therefore order CN to return Mr. Audet to active service in his position of brakeman\/conductor, based out of the Capreol terminal. CN is further ordered to cooperate fully with Mr. Audet and his union, the UTU, in conducting the individual assessment that was denied him at the time, in order to determine which of his duties, if any, require modification to ensure that he is able to perform his job safely and without risk to himself, other persons, property or the environment.\n[127] If Mr. Audet, CN and the UTU determine that he cannot be accommodated in this fashion, I order CN to cooperate fully with Mr. Audet and the UTU to accommodate him, on the first reasonable occasion, in a different position based in Capreol. If it is determined that no such option is available in Capreol, then CN is ordered, on the first reasonable occasion, to work with Mr. Audet and the UTU to look for an appropriate accommodation position outside of Capreol.\n[128] With regard to all of these accommodation efforts, priority is to be placed on positions that come within the same bargaining unit as Mr. Audet's.\nC. Compensation for lost wages [129] I order CN to compensate Mr. Audet for all wages and benefits that he has lost since his removal from service on September 12, 2002, pursuant to s. 53(2)(c) of the Act. The parties undertook at the hearing to engage in discussions with a view to reaching an agreement regarding the calculation of the sum for this compensation, in the event that the Tribunal would issue such an order. The parties will take into account all relevant factors, such as the disability benefits received by Mr. Audet during this period, and any interest due on the sums owing to him.\n[130] Mr. Audet testified as to the efforts he has made to look for other work since 2002, while waiting for CN to accommodate him. He claims that he has made hundreds of job applications, and has been interviewed dozens of times. He is frequently asked at these interviews why CN removed him from service. When he discloses that it was due to an epileptic seizure, employers typically thank him for showing interest in the job they are trying to fill, but opt not to employ him. Earlier in his working career, Mr. Audet gained the qualifications to work in Ontario as a Registered Nursing Assistant and an Emergency Medical Care Assistant. He testified that despite holding these certifications, he was unable to find work anywhere in the Sudbury area.\n[131] In my view, Mr. Audet's efforts at mitigating his damages have been reasonable, especially when considering that CN has never formally dismissed him. It was reasonable for him to have expected that CN, pursuant to its own guidelines and policies, would make a proposal for accommodation to him at some point following his removal from service.\n[132] The parties are therefore instructed to assume, in their discussions regarding the calculation of Mr. Audet's lost wages and benefits, that he has fulfilled his duty to mitigate his damages.\nD. Compensation for pain and suffering - s. 53(2)(3) of the Act [133] Mr. Audet testified as to the emotional impact he felt as a result of his removal from service and the subsequent failure by CN to accommodate him. His wife, who is a registered nurse, became the family's main financial provider. After Mr. Audet's disability benefits ended, she had to begin working on a full-time basis, which involved taking on 12-hour shifts. Their family is made up of two minor children and a 16-year old niece who is under their care. The strain on Mr. Audet's wife of having to provide for all of the family's financial needs on her own took a heavy toll on their marriage. He has needed to take sessions with a counsellor. He testified as to his feeling of abandonment after being denied work by CN. It lowered his self-esteem and made him feel like a nobody. Taking into account all of these circumstances, I order CN to pay Mr. Audet $10,000 in compensation for his pain and suffering.\n[134] Mr. Audet contends that his seizure of September 10, 2002, was provoked by an excessive work load, for which he blames CN. Mr. Audet's legal counsel argued that the compensation for pain and suffering should be augmented to take this factor into account. I disagree.\n[135] To begin with, I do not understand why Mr. Audet's pain and suffering should be assessed differently, depending on whether the seizure was provoked or not. It would appear to me that the objective assessment of a victim's pain and suffering should not vary on account of the alleged blameworthiness of the respondent's conduct.\n[136] Moreover, on the balance of probabilities, I am not convinced from the evidence adduced at the hearing that the seizure was indeed provoked. No medical expert testified, but copies of reports prepared by various physicians were produced by Mr. Audet and CN, which alternately concluded that the seizure was or was not provoked. It is worth noting that while the strain of the workload seems to have caused Mr. Audet to take a 96-hour leave from work in June 2002, it was not established that the workload in the months following was extraordinary. In addition, as Dr. Remillard and Dr. Lapierre noted, the three seizures that Mr. Audet experienced 9 to 14 months after being removed from service would appear to at least cast some doubt as to his claim that the seizure was provoked. Taking all of these factors and considerations into account, I am not persuaded that the September 10, 2002, seizure was provoked.\nE. Special compensation - s. 53(3) of the Act [137] Section 53(3) of the Act provides that the Tribunal may order a respondent to pay up to $20,000 in compensation to a victim of discrimination if the respondent engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. Mr. Audet's legal counsel argued that CN was completely reckless in this case. He cited the unbelievable lack of communication between the various departments, the lack of any leadership, and the failure to involve Mr. Audet and the UTU in the accommodation process, as evidence in support of this submission. He also referred to the fact that it took 15 months before CN made any effort to accommodate him, and that over a period of three years, only two offers of employment were made. Mr. Audet was not qualified for the first job offered, Train Movement Clerk, for lack of a driver's licence. The second job offer was essentially put forth by CN during the hearing. Mr. Audet is requesting that CN be ordered to pay the maximum amount of compensation under this head.\n[138] I agree that CN's conduct in this case was reckless. It is clear that CN was familiar with its duty to accommodate its disabled employees. It had adopted an accommodation policy, in the form of the Accommodation Guidelines, which set out the procedures to be followed with respect to any employees having special needs who required accommodation. Yet, the persons at CN who were responsible for the management of Mr. Audet's case ignored their responsibilities under the policy and did not make any efforts to accommodate him for months on end, until he finally forced their hand by filing his human rights complaint. After being put on notice that their conduct was to be examined against the Act, CN's accommodation efforts were still meagre at best. This course of action was, in my view, reckless.\n[139] In the circumstances, I order CN to pay Mr. Audet the sum of $10,000 in compensation, pursuant to s. 53(3) of the Act.\nF. Costs [140] Mr. Audet seeks an award for his legal costs, either on a solicitor\/client basis or alternatively, on the Federal Court scale. He bases his claim principally on the findings in two relatively recent Tribunal decisions, Brown v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 24, and Brooks v. Canada (Department of Fisheries and Oceans), 2005 CHRT 14. Both decisions were brought before the Federal Court for judicial review. At the time of the hearing into the present complaint, the Federal Court had not as yet issued a judgment in either case.\n[141] After the close of the hearing, the Federal Court released its judgment in Brown on December 13, 2005, (2005 FC 1683), and more recently in Brooks, on April 21, 2006, (2006 FC 500). In both cases, the Court set aside the Tribunal decisions.\n[142] Mr. Audet's legal counsel suggested, during final arguments, that the determination of the issue of costs could be deferred at least until such time as the judicial reviews of the Tribunal decisions are completed. In my view, this is a sound course to follow. Considering the outcome of the judicial reviews, additional submissions from the parties would be welcome. To minimize delay, I have rendered my decision to the extent possible. The parties are invited to submit to the Tribunal any follow-up submissions at their convenience. As I indicate below, I will retain jurisdiction to deal with any remedial issues that may subsequently arise, which includes the question of legal costs or expenses.\n[143] In the meantime, as Mr. Audet's legal counsel had also suggested, the claim for legal costs could be added as a topic for discussion between the parties, along with the calculation of the lost wages and benefits.\nG. Interest [144] Interest is payable in respect of all the awards made in this decision (s. 53(4) of the Act). The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. With respect to the compensation for pain and suffering (s. 53(2)(e) of the Act) and the special compensation (s. 53(3)), the interest shall run from the date of the complaint. As I indicated earlier, however, the parties have undertaken to engage in discussions regarding the calculation of the interest owed on the lost wages and benefits.\nH. Retention of jurisdiction by the Tribunal [145] The Tribunal will retain jurisdiction to receive evidence, hear further submissions and make further orders, if the parties do not reach an agreement, with respect to the issues I have left to them to discuss, and with regard to any other issues or difficulties arising from the interpretation or implementation of the remedies ordered. As I have also indicated, I will likewise retain jurisdiction to deal with Mr. Audet's claim for legal costs.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Introduction [1] The complaint before me alleges that the National Capital Commission (NCC) has discriminated against Bob Brown by denying him access to services by failing to accommodate [his] disability (wheelchair user), contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The alleged discrimination is ongoing.\n[2] The service referred to in the complaint is the York Street Steps, which are located at the intersection of York Street and Sussex Drive, in Ottawa. The steps were completed in 1999. Mr. Brown alleges that they are not accessible. Mr. Brown and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) submit that persons who cannot climb the steps have no way of going from Sussex Drive at the bottom of the stairs to Mackenzie Avenue at the top.\n[3] There was a viewing of the site at the outset of the hearing. I have attached a street map and a few pictures, to give readers a better understanding of the geographical location and appearance of the steps. There is a T-intersection at Sussex: York Street ends in a steep set of stairs, which takes those people who can climb the steps to Mackenzie Avenue and Major\u2019s Hill Park. The Peace Tower and the spire of the library of Parliament are visible from York Street. A bystander can see the Rideau locks descending to the Ottawa River and look across a chasm to Parliament Hill. The heights on either side are impressive.\n[4] One of the reasons why people might want to use the steps is that there is a vista from Major\u2019s Hill Park. I say this because the situation has evolved since the date of the complaint, and the case for the Complainant and the Commission now rests primarily on the use of the Park. The original particulars state that the steps provide a main thoroughfare between the Parliament Buildings and the Byward Market. This may have changed since another set of stairs and an elevator has now been built down the street from the York Street Steps, at the Daly site. There was evidence that this provides a more convenient route between Parliament Hill and the Byward Market.\n[5] I should also say something about the National Capital Commission. The NCC is a Crown Corporation, which takes its mandate from the National Capital Act. The Act gives the NCC responsibility for the development, conservation and improvement of the National Capital Region. The evidence is that the York Street Steps are on land owned by the Crown, but administered by the NCC. The NCC is responsible for their construction and maintenance.\n[6] The NCC is responsible for the general area and insisted that an elevator be provided at the Daly site, some distance down Sussex. The real dispute between the parties is whether this kind of accommodation is sufficient. Mr. Brown and the CHRC say no. They are willing to accept an elevator immediately adjacent to the site; but argue that the Daly elevator is too far away. They also argue that failure to provide access at the site of the steps discriminates against Mr. Brown and persons with disabilities.\n[7] The hearing in the case was delayed by an application from the CHRC to add Public Works Government Services Canada (Public Works) as a party. This arose out of the fact that Mr. Rapson, the expert called by the CHRC, testified that an elevator shaft in an office block immediately adjacent to the steps might be used to provide access. This office block is known as the Connaught Building. It is currently occupied by the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency under a licence to occupy granted by Public Works, which has the care, management and control of the building on behalf of the Crown. The application was allowed.\n[8] The case raises many legal issues pertaining to the responsibilities of the NCC and other public actors in the area of accommodation. There must be many sites where similar issues might arise. The case also raises a narrower question with respect to the duty of the Respondents like the NCC to consult with those who require accommodation. Although this leads into a discussion of some larger issues, each case must be decided on its own merits. I have accordingly restricted myself to the facts of this case.\n[9] The following decision essentially deals with liability. I agreed that I would only deal with the different proposals to provide accommodation at the York Street Steps, if that became necessary.\nII. Facts A. Evidence For The Complainant and CHRC (i) Bob Brown [10] Mr. Brown has been a quadriplegic since 1972 who nevertheless likes to do things on his own and takes pride in his independence. Mr. Brown currently lives on Murray Street, three blocks from the York Street Steps. He testified that he likes to visit Major\u2019s Hill Park,\n[11] At the outset of the hearing, Mr. Brown testified that there are many festivals in Major\u2019s Hill Park. He changed his tack, however, when the Respondent corrected this assertion.\nMr. Harnden: As I recall, you emphasized the importance of accessing the park for the purpose of festivals. Are you withdrawing from that as being a priority usage?\nA. No, I am suggesting that it is not only for festivals. People do go there for festivals, but at other times, as well, from the market. It is just a nice park to go to. You go up and it overlooks the Ottawa River. It's an historic site. There are benches. People go in the evenings, and things like that, just to be in a green space.\nHe later testified that it is a good place to watch the sunset.\n[12] The antecedents to the complaint are more political, however. Mr. Brown was the Chairperson of the City of Ottawa Disability Issues Advisory Committee in 1998, when the steps were being built. Although the NCC did not go through the municipal planning process, since it comes under federal jurisdiction, the proposal to build the steps came to the attention of the Advisory Committee. The Committee discussed the proposal and felt that there were reasons for concern.\n[13] As Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Brown wrote a letter to Mr. Jim Watson, the Mayor of the City of Ottawa at the time. The second paragraph of the letter begins: We, on the Committee, unanimously submit that the design of the new steps is totally unacceptable since it repeats the same architectural barriers which we have been trying for decades to eliminate. The Committee asked the Mayor to arrange a meeting with Mr. Beaudry, the Chairperson of the NCC, to deal with the lack of access at the site.\n[14] Mr. Brown thought that the Mayor wrote to the NCC, as suggested, and requested a meeting. It appears that the NCC did not receive this letter, however, and the evidence before me suggests that the letter was never sent. The question of the steps nevertheless became a public controversy, in part because of a letter that Mr. Brown sent to the editor of Ottawa Citizen.\n[15] The American Embassy is immediately adjacent to the steps, on the north side of the block. The Committee also wrote a letter to someone at the American Embassy, suggesting that the proposed stairs would not be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Embassy was apparently paying for their design. The administrative officer for the American Embassy replied that the NCC had the final authority to determine what would be built at the site. Their concerns were limited to a desire for continuity in the style of the steps and the Embassy.\n[16] The NCC responded to the controversy by arranging a meeting with the Access Committee of the Disabled Persons Community Resources Centre on March 17, 1999, to discuss the situation. The meeting was closed. There was a disagreement between the parties as to whether the Access Committee was the appropriate organization to consult. Mr. Brown was allowed to attend the meeting, but on the basis that he would not discuss it with the Municipal Advisory Committee. He testified that he felt gagged.\n[17] Mr. Brown said that the NCC used the meeting to explain their plans for the Daly site, which would provide access between Sussex and MacKenzie. This did not address his concerns. He felt that he was getting nowhere and filed the present complaint on August 31, 1999. This was after the steps had been constructed. There was an investigation by the CHRC, which took a considerable period of time.\n[18] There were protracted discussions between the parties and the NCC eventually held another meeting, on July 23, 2002, to discuss the options. The participants included representatives from the City of Ottawa Advisory Committee. Mr. Brown was not invited. He felt that the NCC had its mind made up from the beginning and was not willing to consider anything, other than the Daly site. He described the meeting as a sham.\n[19] Despite its efforts, the CHRC was unable to resolve the matter and the complaint was referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. The position of Mr. Brown and the CHRC at the hearing was relatively simple. The York Street Steps are not accessible. There is no accommodation. A person in a wheelchair at the bottom of the steps has no way of going to the top. This is discriminatory. The Daly site provides another route through the area, but does not provide access at the steps.\n[20] Mr. Brown has two basic options at the bottom of the steps. He can turn right, and take the long way around the American Embassy, which would take him to the northeast corner of the Park. Or he can turn left and go through the Daly site. The distance in both directions is a problem. The incline is particularly difficult for a person using a manually operated wheelchair.\n[21] Mr. Brown\u2019s fundamental complaint is simpler, however. He objects to the use of the Daly site because it requires those people who cannot climb the steps to go elsewhere. This separates people.\nMr. Brown: My primary concern is, because of the segregation, it is an unequal level of access. I have to be split up from the people I am travelling with to get to the level change at the top \u2026\nMy biggest concern is the segregation.\nMr. Brown says that he should be able to access the top of the steps from the base of the steps. There should be accommodation at the site.\n[22] Mr. Brown testified that the delay in using the alternative routes was enough to lose any party that might be waiting for him at the top of the steps.\nIf I am travelling, for example, with people, human nature being what it is -- travelling up, for example, York Street -- human nature being what it is, usually the other parties take the path of least resistance, or the shortest route. Their preference most times is to walk up the steps, and I have to go to another site and meet them at the top of the steps.\nSo I am excluded from being part of my party. I am made to feel different, and I do feel different having to do that.\nAnyone who accompanies Mr. Brown will be stigmatized in the same way.\n[23] This raises a question of dignity.\nMr. Brown: I feel that I should be afforded the same, equal opportunity to have access as other citizens at the same location -- at the same site, or something very close -- adjacent -- as a reasonable accommodation. Having to travel to a separate site is not a reasonable accommodation, in my opinion.\nIf I am with other people, it is undignified. I am made to feel like a second-class citizen because I am not permitted to use the same facility as other citizens of Canada.\nThis is the national capital of Canada. It is a symbolic area, as well.\nMr. Brown feels that the current situation is discriminatory. His concerns extend to elderly people, people with children in strollers, and anyone who has difficulty climbing the steps.\n[24] Mr. Brown\u2019s solution is simple. He feels that there should be an elevator at the base of the steps. If that is not possible, he thinks that an elevator immediately adjacent to the site would be acceptable, as long as you can see it from the base of the steps. He was accordingly willing to consider the use of the elevator at the north end of the Connaught Building.\n(ii) David Lloyd Rapson [25] David Lloyd Rapson was called by the Commission as an expert witness in accessibility and universal design. He was originally retained in October, 2000 and asked to look at a number of options. One was the possibility of using other locations.\n[26] Mr. Rapson\u2019s background is in community planning. He also studied architectural technology and was trained in accessibility assessment. He has a breadth of experience in accommodation. He has done committee work for the Canadian Standards Association and contributed to a manual on the best practices in universal design.\n[27] Mr. Rapson served as the assistant director of the Universal Design Institute at the University of Manitoba. He chaired an access advisory committee for the City of Winnipeg and led a team of fifteen people in preparing an accessibility audit of downtown Winnipeg. I should also mention that Mr. Rapson broke his back in 1993, and has some problems with his legs. He uses a cane, so his consulting is informed by some of his own experiences.\n[28] Mr. Rapson testified that there has already been considerable work in developing a set of criteria that can be used to conduct accessibility assessments. There is an emerging discipline in the field of accessibility assessment. The discipline takes in a myriad of physical, psychological, sociological and public policy considerations. Some of these factors concern the process that is employed in planning, designing and constructing accessible sites.\n[29] The basic criteria employed in these assessments are found in the principles of universal design. Mr. Rapson referred to these principles as guidelines, though even that word seems too strict. They are more like a statement of aspirations, which is commonly relied upon, in planning, designing and developing physical environments that are free of barriers. The word barrier refers to anything that may impede people who want to make use of them. I have attached Mr. Rapson\u2019s formulation of the principles of universal design in Appendix B.\n[30] In his testimony, Mr. Rapson made a distinction between accessibility and universal design.\nA. Accessibility is a function of compliance with regulations or criteria that establish a minimum level of design necessary to accommodate people with disabilities.\nFor example, most building codes -- the national building code, the Ontario building code, the Manitoba building code -- usually have the minimums, This is the minimum that you can design for it. Universal design is more of an art and a practice of design to accommodate the widest variety and the number of people through their lifespans.\nThe principles of universal design provide the more general framework in which specific issues of accessibility can be considered.\n[31] The accessibility issue has a legal and a technical side. Mr. Rapson described his task in the immediate case as follows:\nA. There were two basic questions: an expert opinion on how the location could be made accessible to wheelchair users; and to have sufficient information to enable the CHRC to determine whether the respondent had met its legal responsibility to accommodate wheelchair users to the point of undue hardship.\nThe second question is problematic. The issue behind it, at least, is whether the Respondent has met its obligation to accommodate persons with disabilities under the Canadian Human Rights Act. This is a question that is reserved for the Tribunal. It would be an error to accept Mr. Rapson\u2019s views as a legal opinion.\n[32] Mr. Rapson was entitled, as an expert in accessibility and universal design, to speak to the technical side of the question. There is not that much that anyone can say, in this context. The Respondent did not dispute the fact that the steps, as originally constructed, are not accessible. They were not designed in accordance with the principles of universal design and do not meet current standards. The contentious question is whether the NCC has rectified the situation.\n[33] Mr. Rapson is of the view that the York Street Steps do not meet the principles of universal design. They are not, in his view, accessible. The elevator at the Daly site does not rectify the situation. I have generally accepted Mr. Rapson\u2019s opinion on these issues. I found his evidence thoughtful and measured. He understood the need to make reasonable compromises.\n(a) Mr. Rapson\u2019s reports [34] Mr. Rapson made two reports. The first report was dated June 14, 2001, and was limited by the fact that he was not given any funding to visit the site. I think this was an error in judgement on the part of the CHRC, which was taking a real risk, in asking him to write a report without a physical examination of the site. I nevertheless accept that any deficiencies in the initial report had been made up by the time of the hearing.\n[35] Mr. Rapson had a series of photographs taken of the site. He also asked colleagues to inspect it for him. He spoke to a variety of people and tried to pull in as much information as he could. This included correspondence, site plans, and other documentary material.\n[36] The first report concludes that the steps contravene three of the guiding principles of universal design: equitable use; flexibility in use, and low physical effort. They did not meet the principles of universal design. The alternative routes were excessively long. There were also problems with the consultation process adopted in 1994.\n[37] Mr. Rapson nevertheless acknowledged that the site was challenging. The hill was too steep to permit the construction of a viable ramp, and an exterior elevating system was not appropriate. He accordingly proposed his own alternative.Mr. Rapson thought that the obvious solution was to make use of an elevator in the Connaught Building, immediately beside the steps. He felt that the NCC did not have a sufficiently encompassing consultation process with the adjacent building occupants in the Connaught Building. I agree with this conclusion.\n[38] The second report from Mr. Rapson is essentially a response to the Universal Accessibility Assessment Study prepared for the Respondent by Robertson Martin in July 2002. It contains his final conclusions. There are some differences in the two reports, but I think it is more important to focus on his testimony, which followed the outline of the second report.\n[39] Mr. Rapson made additional investigations after issuing the second report and made three or four visits to the steps. He measured the time it took to complete the various routes around the steps. He estimated that the trip to the top of the steps, via the Daly site, or around the U.S. embassy, was six to eight minutes.\n[40] Mr. Rapson also observed the pedestrian traffic.\nMr. Rapson: There was a steady flow of people going up and down.\nI did one count for the eight minutes and it worked out to somewhere around 85 people, somewhere in that range, varying in age, varying in size -- families, single people.\nThere was one family with a carriage with a young one in it, and they were bouncing their way down.\nThere were a number of scooters that I saw traveling at the bottom.\nThere was a young family, as I mentioned earlier, with a baby carriage that couldn't make it up the stairs, so they had to go around. It was the same for an elderly person in a manual chair with somebody pushing them.\nQ. You mentioned that someone couldn't make it up the stairs. Had they attempted to --\nA. They were looking for a way to get up to the park. They were down by the Byward Market.\nThe point is simply that the steps present a barrier to a wide range of people.\n[41] Mr. Rapson testified that it would be wrong to look at the site solely from the perspective of a person in a wheelchair. His concern was with anyone who was unable to climb the stairs. He also testified that there is no perfect solution. The best solution for one user might not meet the needs of other users.\n(b) Mr. Rapson\u2019s conclusions [42] Mr. Rapson\u2019s central conclusion was that the original design of the York Street Steps does not meet the principles of universal design. The steps are not accessible. The alternative routes were excessively long. It was therefore a matter of retro-fitting an inadequate design. This is always problematic.\n[43] Some of Mr. Rapson\u2019s criticism concerned the lack of consultation. He suggested that there should have been a proper process of consultation in 1994, when the steps were designed. He agreed with a statement attributed to the architect for the American Embassy, who allegedly commented that this was a missed opportunity. I only repeat this comment because it captures Mr. Rapson\u2019s view.\n[44] Mr. Rapson was firmly of the view that the disabled community, the public and any interested parties should all have had a say in what was to be done with the site. This is a fundamental aspect of universal design and the NCC had not done enough in this regard. The participants at the meetings that ultimately took place were not given a full range of options. They were essentially forced to make a choice between the options presented by the architects.\n[45] Nor was it a matter of dealing solely with persons who have mobility problems. The final design should accommodate persons with visual, hearing, and cognitive problems; it should accommodate persons of various heights, widths and ages. It should accommodate parents with children in strollers. Mr. Rapson recommended a signage strategy. There should be benches and rest stops placed in the area.\n[46] The NCC bridled at the suggestion that it was not committed to the principles of universal design. Mr. Rapson relented somewhat on cross-examination, and stated that he consulted the NCC\u2019s Barrier Free Site Design Manual in preparing his reports. He agreed that it provided evidence of good intentions. His position nevertheless remained the same. The design of the steps did not meet the principles of universal design.\n[47] Mr. Rapson acknowledged the challenges presented by the site. The hill was high and steep. The site was tight: it was too narrow to allow for stairs and a proper ramping system. A stair platform lift would not be appropriate. Weather was a serious concern. The sociology of the area must also be taken into account. There are rough elements in the neighbourhood. Those who made use of an elevator might have legitimate fears about walking down a corridor, out of public view.\n[48] There were historical and cultural factors. Mr. Rapson described Ottawa as a showpiece of Canada. This must be taken into account. There is also the fact that the American Embassy is next door. The cost of any adjustments would have to be considered, as would engineering and security issues. The competing interests must be balanced.\n[49] The second report goes through the options in the Robertson Report. Mr. Rapson added the Connaught Building as an option. The first option in the Robertson Report was the status quo. This was unacceptable. Option 2, a stair platform lift, was unworkable. It would be open to the air and inclement weather. It would be cumbersome, since two lifts would be necessary. The manual operation of the lift would present a problem for people with disabilities.\n[50] Option 3 was the Connaught Building. The Connaught Building had level access at ground level and above, on MacKenzie Avenue. There was a ramp adjacent to the York Street Steps. The first report from Mr. Rapson suggests that the existing entrances, exits and elevator could be used. The second report suggests a new elevator. There was an elevator shaft at the ramp. This was the best option. There would have to be push button access and upgrades in the building to meet current accessibility standards.\n[51] I think the Respondents have overstated the fact that Mr. Rapson has never been in the Connaught Building. He had the floor plans, and if the matter did not go beyond that, it was because the Respondents were not willing to pursue it. Mr. Rapson was merely recommending that the building be considered. He accepted that there may be security concerns that would prevent the building from being used, and acknowledged that his proposal was a suggestion.\n[52] Option 3a was a vertical elevating device. Mr. Rapson thought that this was a feasible option but acknowledged that it would have to be located on the property of the NCC, presumably at the back of the site, beside the steps. This meant that the current retaining wall would have to be moved, an expensive and even awkward proposition. Mr. Brown asked about the possibility of constructing an elevator at another location on the site, but Mr. Rapson warned that there would be engineering problems.\n[53] Mr. Rapson was generally happy with the idea of an elevator. He was nevertheless concerned about the canyon effect that would be produced by locating it at the back of the site, beside a five or six metre retaining wall. The corridor leading to the elevator would be dark and aesthetically undesirable. He had additional concerns about the size and design of any elevator. He had concerns about vandalism, and general security issues.\n[54] The fourth option was to make use of the proposed elevator at the Daly site. Mr. Rapson felt that this was simply too far away. It did not meet at least two of the principles of universal design, which call for an equitable solution that requires low physical effort. He also thought that it would stigmatize those persons who had to use the alternative route.\n[55] Mr. Rapson thought the elevator at the Daly site was needed. But it did not resolve the problem at the York Street Steps, which needed on-site access. The Daly site would also stigmatize people who had to use the elevator. Mr. Rapson felt that this is a common problem with access. People with disabilities are unintentionally segregated from other people.\n[56] There is real symbolism here. This kind of issue goes to the heart of the legislation and the concept of equality that is enshrined in the law of the person. Compromises must be made. The practicalities of any situation must be taken into account; but so must the needs of dignity. People who cannot climb the steps should be accommodated, as much as possible, at the site.\n[57] Mr. Rapson took the position that it was not his place to substitute his views for those who had an interest in accommodation at the steps. The most appropriate solution could only be determined through the process of consultation. He was nevertheless satisfied that the Daly site did not provide access close enough to the steps. That seemed to leave an elevator, either on site or in the Connaught Building. He also felt that there might be ways of dealing with the security problem in the Connaught Building that were never explored.\n(iii) Barry McMahon [58] Barry McMahon has lived in Ottawa for 30 years. At one point, he had an audiovisual company at 61A York Street, in the ByWard Market. He is accordingly familiar with the York Street Steps and the surrounding area.\n[59] Mr. McMahon has post-polio mylitis. This affects the neurons in the muscles, which restricts the amount of activity that he can undertake. He has been using a wheelchair and a scooter in an effort to delay the advance of his condition.\n[60] Mr. McMahon has known the Complainant for 14 years. He nominated Mr. Brown to the Municipal Advisory Committee on Disability in 1996, while he was chairing the Committee. The Committee had an extremely broad mandate and dealt with any matters within the municipality that raised disability issues.It is now mandatory under provincial legislation that cities in Ontario have such a committee.\n[61] The selection process for the Municipal Advisory Committee is open. Members are sought through the media, through City Council, through the members of the Committee, and the City Clerk. There is another committee that recommends candidates for membership. They are appointed by the mayor, by motion in council.\n[62] The process at the Committee was relatively straightforward.The planning Committee would submit individual site plans to the Advisory Committee for recommendations.There was a formal distribution sheet in the planning department. They did not deal with the interior of the building unless it was a municipal site.\n[63] Mr. McMahon resigned from the position of chair in the middle of 1998. Mr. Brown was elected as the new Chair and remained in that position until the City of Ottawa was amalgamated. Mr. McMahon resigned from the Advisory Committee in 2003. He was the interim chair of the Accessibility Advisory Committee of Ontario at the time he testified.\n[64] The history of the matter really goes back to 1998, when it was brought to the attention of the Municipal Advisory Committee that the York Street Steps were being redesigned. In January 1999, the Committee formed a subcommittee to deal with the project. The Committee felt that the existing steps were a barrier and did not want to see the barrier duplicated. There was a lot of anger and frustration. The Committee felt that the original design of the steps was flawed.\n[65] The Committee was apparently told that the estimates put the cost of the stairs at 38 thousand dollars per step. They felt that this should have been sufficient to deal with the access issue. There were a number of letters. Mr. McMahon thought that Jim Watson, the Mayor, wrote to the Chairman of the NCC.\n[66] The minutes of the Accessibility Advisory Committee from August of 2002 refer to the meeting. Giles Warren and Danielle Vincent reported to the Committee as a whole. Mr. Warren reported to the Committee that the only solution offered by the NCC was the elevator at the Daly site. The feeling of the Committee was that the NCC had already decided that access would be provided at the Daly site. This was a fait accompli and was not open to negotiation.\n[67] Mr. McMahon felt that the Daly site was not a viable solution. It was simply too far away. The Daly site doesn\u2019t solve the problem at all, he testified. You might as well go around the block. Access should be provided immediately at the foot of the steps. The Committee felt that the Daly site was a token solution. There was a general feeling that it was futile to participate further in the process. Mr. McMahon now realizes that this may have been a mistake.\n[68] Mr. McMahon testified that he sent an email to the U.S. Architects and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board in Washington D.C on March 19, 1999. He advised them of the situation, on the basis that they had provided part of the infrastructure for the American Embassy. He received a response from the Compliance Board in April, with a copy of a letter from someone in the Department of State saying that the matter was out of their jurisdiction.\n[69] Mr. McMahon clearly felt that the problem lies in the design of the Steps. The elevator at the Daly building does not address this problem at all. It merely diverts the problem. The other side of the Daly site is nowhere. There is a tremendous amount of congestion in the area. There are street kids, homeless people, beggars and vagrants in the area. The corner of Sussex Drive and Rideau Street is particularly bad.\n[70] Mr. McMahon feels that the existing situation is intolerable. He said it is amazing how much inconvenience the NCC is causing to people at the site. It is not simply people in wheelchairs. The same problems confront women with toddlers in strollers, elderly people, people who are overweight, people with visual disabilities. If there was an alternate way of negotiating the steps, he believes that it would be heavily used.\n[71] Mr. McMahon thought that the main alternative would be an elevator. The transit way has had elevators for 10 years. There could also be a funicular. He testified that people should be offered an alternative at the bottom and the top. The most convenient location would be beside the Connaught Building, below the landing on the MacKenzie Street side. He stressed the importance of maintaining visual contact between people who are travelling together and felt that an elevator on the site would be the best solution.\n[72] There is a question of inclusion here. Mr. McMahon stated that splitting up at the steps, with the intention of rejoining his party at the top of the stairs, accentuates his disability. The steps are a barrier. A person\u2019s disability comes to the fore and becomes predominant when faced with a barrier. The goal in accessibility is to remove these barriers. The purpose of universal design is to incorporate disabled persons seamlessly into the public and society.\n(iv) Giles Warren [73] Giles Warren testified from Hamilton. He has had polio since childhood and uses a wheelchair. He lived in Ottawa for forty years and was a member of the Municipal Advisory Committee on Disabilities from 2000 to 2003. He was vice chair by the time he left. Mr. Warren did not spend much time in the area of the York Street Steps. He was nevertheless aware of the issues surrounding the steps from his committee work.\n[74] Mr. Warren was the Chair of the subcommittee on site approvals. He was asked to go to a meeting in July, 2002. The meeting was July 23 at the headquarters of the NCC. Mr. Warren did not know the other people at the meeting, other than Danielle Vincent. Mr. Warren says that he went to the meeting with an open mind. The Accessibility Study commissioned by the NCC--the Robertson report--was neutral.\n[75] When Mr. Warren got to the meeting, however, he discovered that the Mr. Martin, the consulting architect, was already in favour of using the proposed elevator at the Daly site. Security had become a major concern. The overall message was simple: the preferred alternative was to install a public elevator at the Daly Building. Mr. Warren says that the other options were never seriously addressed. It was a window dressing exercise.\n[76] The minutes of the meeting prepared by Mr. Martin demonstrate that Mr. Warren agreed that the Daly site was the best solution. Mr. Warren discounted this. He says that he only agreed because there were a limited number of options on the table. None of the options addressed the real problem, which was the original design of the steps.\n[77] Mr. Warren\u2019s report to the Municipal Advisory Committee uses the same words. The minutes of the Committee describe the meeting as window dressing to satisfy the concerns of the CHRC. There was an informal discussion of the situation at the Committee, after which the matter was left hanging. The Committee basically left it to the CHRC to deal with the matter.\n[78] Danielle Vincent from Disabled Persons Community Resources was also at the meeting. Mr. Warren testified that she shared his view that the meeting was window dressing. Ms. Vincent did not testify so the statement is hearsay. I accordingly think it would be wrong to place any weight on it.\n[79] Mr. Warren was accommodating on cross-examination. He was willing to accept that the NCC was within its rights to assume that the Municipal Advisory Committee supported the Daly-site option. He recognizes that the NCC may not have appreciated his objections. He realizes, in retrospect, that he should have gone back to the planners and architects and expressed his views to them.\n[80] This does not change his view of the situation. Mr. Warren was not happy with any of the alternatives proposed in the Robertson Report. He thought the proposed location for an elevator at the steps was impractical. The alleyway between the Connaught Building and the steps was dangerous. He was concerned with vandalism and with the threat posed by vagrants in the area. This included the Daly site.\n[81] Mr. Warren rejected the idea that the elevator at the Daly site would provide equal access. He felt that it was like asking disabled people to use the back door. He suggested that the use of an alternative route might be justified on the same separate but equal rationale that was used to justify segregation. He remembered signs directing blacks to different washrooms or rear entrances.\n[82] Mr. Warren also thought the extra distance to the Daly Building was a significant obstacle. It was just as easy to walk around the block.\nB. Evidence For The NCC (i) G\u00e9rald Lajeunesse [83] G\u00e9rald Lajeunesse is the Chief Landscape Architect for the NCC. He has been working for the NCC since 1977. He became the project director for Confederation Boulevard in 1988.\n[84] Mr. Lajeunesse testified that the NCC is committed to universal access and published a Barrier-Free Site Design Manual in 1995. The manual provides a tool for people preparing projects under the purview of the NCC. The major part of the process however consists of consultation. The NCC introduced a Universal Access Policy in 1996, which applies to its sites, buildings and services and to those which it leases. There is an internal committee, which performs assessments for government departments and monitors developments in the area.\n[85] One of the major elements in the NCC\u2019s plans for the National Capital is Confederation Boulevard. The Boulevard runs for seven and a half kilometres and includes the ceremonial route to the Governor General\u2019s residence. The frontage along Sussex Drive and MacKenzie Avenue, and the York Street Steps, are considered part of the Boulevard.\n[86] Confederation Boulevard is designed to accommodate large gatherings of people and allows lingering. The sidewalks are generous. The idea is to give the pedestrian priority. Mr. Lajeunesse testified that Major\u2019s Hill Park might be considered an exception to the general plan. The NCC tries to minimize activity in the area, to protect the vegetation, which is apparently on thin soil. The primary pedestrian route is from the Parliament Buildings on Wellington Street to Rideau Street, and then along Sussex Drive to York Street, and into the Byward Market area.\n[87] Mr. Lajeunesse took over the York Street Steps site in 1989. Alex Kilgour, the project manager for the York Street Steps, reported to him. There was an insignificant set of stairs at the site. The area was derelict. They had already decided on a grand stairway, which would provide a strong visual connector between lower and upper town.\n[88] This is where history and aesthetics enter into the matter. The York Street Steps are part of a view corridor, an uninterrupted view-shed between lower and upper town. They are a visual link between the town\u2014the Byward Market\u2014and the crown, which takes in the Chateau Laurier and the back of the Parliament Buildings. I accept the NCC\u2019s view that it is important to protect the view-shed.\n[89] The NCC was aware of its obligation to provide access at the proposed steps. The architects investigated the possibility of providing ramps. The grade was too steep, however, and there would be a problem with switchbacks. They also looked into the possibility of providing an elevating device. The problem was that an elevator adjacent to the steps would have created a tunnel. This was the wrong feeling. The physical site was too restricted to consider other options.\n[90] There were other issues. There was virtually no retail along Sussex, so there was little activity at night. This created safety concerns. There were inappropriate activities at the York Street Steps. There was also a new development at the Daly site. The NCC wanted to take advantage of it and eventually reached the conclusion that it was the only realistic site for an elevator.\n[91] Mr. Lajeunesse testified that there was no serious discussion of the Connaught Building. The problem was security. They recognized that things could change. Jean Piggott, the previous Chair of the NCC, had recommended that public buildings on Confederation Boulevard have a public face. There should be some public access. So ideally the Connaught Building would be open to the public in some fashion.\n[92] The Daly site was more accommodating and more inviting, if a passageway was needed. There were no dark spots. It was a controlled environment, and offered better security. Mr. Lajeunesse testified that you have to take advantage of opportunities when they arise. The NCC owned the land at the Daly site and was in a position to demand concessions from the developer. There were negotiations concerning the construction of an elevator at the site. The NCC insisted that it meet universal standards.\n[93] There was a dispute about the reasons behind the position taken by the NCC when the steps were originally designed. The CHRC suggested that the NCC preferred the Daly site because the developer would bear the costs. It also suggested that aesthetics entered into the decision. Mr. Lajeunesse equivocated, and then rejected the suggestion that any of the alternatives were rejected on the basis of costs or aesthetics. The review of the matter after the complaint was filed looked at other concerns.\n[94] There were two rounds of consultations before the steps were built. One included a meeting with the Federal Interdepartmental Technical Committee on Accessibility, and another with representatives of the Disabled Persons\u2019 Community Resources Group. There were discussions with the CHRC and another round of consultations, after Mr. Brown laid his complaint. This culminated in the meeting that was held in 2002.\n[95] During these consultations, the CHRC sought to obtain information about the Connaught Building. A letter to Mr. Lajeunesse dated October 24, 2000 asked for details of the Connaught Building, including the service entrance area, the front entrance area, and floor plans.\n[96] Mr. Lajeunesse made inquiries and eventually received a cursory letter from Raymond Charette, a property and facility manager for Public Works, dated September 13, 2001. The letter responds as follows:\nThe high security requirements of Canada Customs and Revenue Agency\u2019s Headquarters at the Connaught Building and prohibitive cost of altering this heritage building to accommodate a public elevator precludes us from opening this building for public access between Mackenzie Avenue and Sussex Drive.\nThis was essentially the final word on the subject and foreclosed any further discussions.\n[97] The NCC set out its position in a letter to the CHRC on October 3, 2001. The substance of the letter is as follows:\nDuring the initial design phase for the York Steps, the NCC did not pursue the option of providing universal access through the Connaught Building because [it was designated] as a high security federal building and could not, as such, be promoted as a public building. The hours of operation for the Connaught Building are very restrictive, while the hours of operation for the building proposed at the Daly site would provide the flexibility that could accommodate a universal access between MacKenzie and Sussex.\nTherefore, the [National Capital] Commission has identified an equitable, alternative, contiguous route through the Daly Site, given the fact that both the Connaught Building and the US Embassy are high security buildings.\nThe Commission strongly objects to the statement made that it does not clearly understand Universal Design and Access and that appropriate training session(s) be organized for its staff.\nThe NCC stands by this position.\n[98] The NCC nevertheless took a second look at the situation after Mr. Brown filed his complaint. There was apparently a mediation. The NCC commissioned an Accessibility study from Robertson Martin, which was referred to in the hearing as the Robertson Report. This report quickly disposes of any idea that the buildings adjacent to the site could be used to provide access.\nBuildings adjacent to the York Staircase are high security buildings and therefore utilization of them for elevators, etc., is impossible. Also, hours of access would be restrictive.\nThe report also notes that the RCMP has security arrangements in the area.\n[99] It appears that Mr. Martin, the consulting architect, chaired the meeting on July 23, 2002, which Mr. Warren attended on behalf of the Municipal Advisory Committee. Mr. Lajeunesse also had a leading role. Mr. Lajeunesse took the position that there was a consensus that the Daly site was the best. I accept his sincerity, in saying this.\n(ii) Jerrold Corush [100] Jerrold Corush is a landscape architect. His firm was asked by the NCC to assist in the design of the U.S. Embassy and the York Street Steps in 1994. The Embassy was designed twice as a result of the security issues that arose as a result of the Oklahoma bombing.\n[101] Mr. Corush testified that they looked into the issue of access. All of the alternatives seemed problematic. They rejected the idea of a ramp. There would be too many turns and the number of switchbacks seemed rather onerous. The people using the ramps would run into the people going up and down the steps.\n[102] The possibility of a funicular was investigated. A funicular is essentially a box on wheels. This would require a conductor. There were operational and safety concerns. They considered an escalator, which would have to be inside. That would require the construction of a building. There would be problems with maintenance.\n[103] There was discussion of an elevator. There were two basic locations. The first was down the alley beside the steps, which was used by truck traffic to and from the Connaught Building. This was problematic. The trucks used the entire space for turning. They were banging the walls as it was. The area between the steps and the Connaught Building was also a dead space. There would not be enough people to ensure the safety of the area.\n[104] The architects also considered the possibility of an elevator tower on Sussex, with a catwalk leading to Mackenzie. This was rejected for visual concerns\u2014it affected the porosity of the view\u2014and because it raised concerns about safety. Weather was another problem. The catwalk would be exposed and yet isolated from the public. It follows that there were design and safety problems with both of the proposed locations for an elevator.\n[105] There was an extensive discussion of these issues. The manner in which an elevator would be operated was also considered. Would there, for example, be key cards? This would be awkward. Mr. Corush felt that an elevator should probably be manned. Surveillance was discussed. The CHRC submitted that costs entered into the evaluation of all of these issues.\n[106] I think the Respondent has intentionally underplayed the importance of aesthetics in making these decisions. Mr. Corush testified that the architects wanted to maintain the visual corridor down York Street and up the steps, leading to the library of Parliament. This provides a spatial connexion between the town and the crown. They also wanted a set of stairs that matched the embassy.\n[107] In the end, none of the on-site solutions seemed satisfactory. They accordingly examined what was available off-site and concluded that the pedestrian traffic coming out of the market had two fundamental destinations. One was the Chateau Laurier and Parliament Hill; the other was Major\u2019s Hill Park. They needed a route to each. The second route was already there: if necessary, people could walk around the American Embassy, which would take them to the north east end of the park. The first could be supplied by the Daly site.\n[108] That was where the matter was left. There was no real process of consultation and the architects relied on their own judgement, in recommending the final design. They were not completely happy with the situation. Mr. Corush acknowledged that the distances involved in using the alternative routes are significant, particularly for someone in a wheelchair. He recognized that disabled people would be displaced by the York Street Steps. I think this implicitly acknowledges that there is separate treatment.\n(iii) Robert Martin [109] Robert Martin was retained by the NCC in April 2002 to study the York Street Steps. This was in response to Mr. Brown\u2019s complaint and the CHRC\u2019s investigation of the matter. Mr. Martin\u2019s firm, Robertson Martin Architects, has a specialty in universal access. They have done building reports and accessibility audits for the NCC.\n[110] Mr. Martin did an extensive site review and prepared a report entitled Universal Accessibility Assessment Study: York Street Steps. The report is dated July 2002 and contains a number of appendices. Appendix B lists seven principles of universal design, which are in keeping with the principles set out in the Rapson reports. Mr. Martin testified that these principles constitute the best practice in the area.\n[111] The consulting group that prepared the report had a wide range of materials relating to the York Street site. This included the CAD (Computer Assisted Drawing) files used in constructing the steps. They made a physical examination of the site. They did class D cost estimates for an elevator, which came in at 427,000 dollars. This class of estimates is rough, at best, with a high range of error and an expected range of plus or minus 20 percent.\n[112] Mr. Martin described the purpose of the Robertson Report as follows:\nMr. Martin: I think there was a real sense that the steps had been constructed and that this was a second opportunity to review all of the existing installations and to examine whether there might be new technologies or devices that hadn't been present when the steps were being designed and constructed that perhaps the NCC had missed and that we might identify in our report.\nIt is clear from the evidence that the NCC wanted to preserve the original design of the steps. I think this is probably one of the reasons why the proposed location for an elevator at the site was beside the steps. It was a matter of finding some kind of add-on, which would solve the problem of access without disrupting the original design.\n[113] The NCC did not merely ask Mr. Martin to look into re-fits, however. He testified that one of the major purposes of the Robertson Report was to consult the community and the persons who needed access.\nMr. Martin: The goal was not only to look at all of the existing site issues, but also to involve community and stakeholder groups in this process so that there would be both solicitation and receipt of feedback as to the options identified and whether they made sense.\nWe approached a number of community groups and asked them to provide representatives for the study. The quite direct briefing from the NCC was to be as inclusive as possible to get this orchestration because the study would not be as useful if it wasn't done with the full participation of these groups.\nThe NCC was adamant about this aspect of the process.\n[114] Mr. Martin\u2019s plan in writing the report was to determine what options were realistically available, and identify the advantages and disadvantages of each. This included various platform lifts and an elevator, both on and off site. He would then present these options to the stakeholders and obtain their views. The final report would take their views into account.\n[115] The CHRC made much of the fact that the draft report recommended that an elevator at the steps would be the best way to provide access. There was an email memo from Danica Robertson to Sherry Berg at the NCC, dated 1:37 p.m. June 17th. It states that an elevator at the York Street Steps would be the best option. Ms. Berg responded at 4:39 p.m., the same day, with a request that the Daly site be added to the options listed in the report.\n[116] Mr. Martin testified that there was a security problem. They accordingly took a look at possibilities along the entire block and discovered that there was a lease agreement with the developers of the Daly site to provide an elevator. There would be passive security available at the site. There would be a concierge. There would also be residents in the area.\n[117] The draft report was circulated to a list of contact groups. This was followed by the rather controversial meeting on July 22, 2002. It seems to me that the meeting was rushed. The material was sent out on July 18th. Mr. Martin was apparently advised by Sherry Berg not to invite Mr. Brown, since he was a party to the proceedings before the Tribunal. Nor was he informed that the meeting was taking place.\n[118] There were five representatives from the NCC at the meeting, along with two consulting architects. There was also a representative from the American Embassy. I think that this official presence had an effect on the other participants. They were outnumbered seven to four. The evidence nevertheless suggests that two of the outside participants were happy with the proposed solutions.\n[119] The evidence of Mr. Martin was that the individuals at the meeting were polled. Each person at the meeting was asked to give their views. This seems to have included at least some of the representatives of the NCC. Mr. Martin felt that there was a complete consensus. This assessment leaves too much out. Mr. Warren, for his part, described the entire exercise as window dressing. This may be too harsh, but it seems clear that the results were pre-ordained.\n[120] There was a general discussion of the options identified in the draft report. The proposed elevator would require access along the side of the retaining wall, some distance from the street. This would create a dark alley feel. There was a debate during the hearing as to the possible locations of the proposed elevator. There is apparently a basic rule that the entrance to an elevator should be provided at the base of the accompanying stairs. Mr. Brown was upset that this was not considered.\n[121] The problem from a security perspective was the length of a walkway. It would have to be covered and heated to deal with the weather. This would attract street people, who naturally seek the comfort and protection of an enclosed space. This presents a serious concern with safety however, particularly in the case of the disabled community, which is more vulnerable than other segments of society. Mr. Martin summed up the attitude at the meeting in the phrase: you can put an elevator there but I wouldn\u2019t use it.\n[122] In the end, Mr. Martin thought there was overwhelming support for the Daly-site proposal. He prepared minutes after the meeting and circulated them. He asked for corrections. None were requested. There were apparently some further communications, but none that changed the consensus at the meeting. Mr. Martin did not feel that any further input was necessary.\n[123] Mr. Martin testified that there would be many internal problems with the use of the Connaught Building. There are stairs that would have to be negotiated on both the ground and the upper floor, in order to access the elevator from the street. But he was fair about the matter. The possibilities were never really investigated.\n[124] After the meeting, Mr. Martin wrote up his report. I have already gone through the options that it identifies, in reviewing the evidence of Mr. Rapson. There were some changes. The Daly site was added and was ultimately recommended as the best option. There were minor changes. The following line was added, in para. 2.2: Mechanical options had been ruled out due to high construction and maintenance costs as well as vandalism concerns. This was added as a result of the conversation at the meeting.\n[125] There was another change. There are security facilities for the American Embassy in the area. The draft report suggested that the presence of the RCMP in the general vicinity would also provide security at the steps. Mr. Martin was later advised that the police were not there to provide security for the steps. The report was accordingly changed.\n[126] The parties disagreed about costs and aesthetics. Mr. Martin acknowledged that aesthetic considerations came into the matter. None of the options were discredited on that basis, however. He minimized the significance of costs. This was met on the other side with the observation that the NCC chose the cheapest alternative. Which was to do nothing at all. The York Street Steps remain exactly as they were.\n[127] I am satisfied that cost was a significant factor. The report refers to the need to provide universal access without placing an undue hardship of financial burden on the NCC.\nThe least imperfect, while still extremely problematic, option for providing on-site Universal Accessibility would be to reconstruct the south wall of the stair in a new location to allow a dedicated ramped access to an elevating device. This would involve considerable redesign of the stair[s] and the structure, at great cost to the NCC, and result in the introduction of elements that may conflict with site [i.e., sight] lines from the Byward Market to Parliament Hill. Considering that there will be a 24-hour accessible elevator at the near by Daly site, the overall construction cost for moving the wall and installing an elevating device, as well as the destruction of the aesthetic symmetry of the stair and site lines to Parliament Hill, could be considered extreme for the anticipated end use. The end result may be highly unappealing for users.\nI think it is clear that cost and aesthetics were significant factors.\n[128] Mr. Martin said that the only option that was not feasible from a cost perspective was to completely rebuild the stairs. The implications are troubling. If this is just another way of saying that access cannot be provided, it is not a satisfactory answer. The NCC cannot build the steps without access, however, and then simply argue that the design of the steps make it too expensive to provide it.\n[129] Mr. Martin was not happy with the final solution but says that it was the best that could be done in the circumstances. Mr. Brown pointed out that Mr. Martin was not aware of the slope between the York Street Steps and the Daly site. The difference would only be significant to someone with a disability. He clearly felt that Mr. Martin failed to appreciate the significance of the distance between the York Street Steps and the Daly site.\n(iv) \u00c9ric H\u00e9bert [130] \u00c9ric H\u00e9bert has been an architectural assistant and an accessibility advisor, un conseiller en accessibilit\u00e9 with the NCC for 17 years. He is familiar with the principles of universal design and reviews site plans for accessibility issues. His job is to ensure that there is enough room for proper wheelchair access. He also conducts workshops on accommodations for people with various disabilities.\n[131] Mr. H\u00e9bert is a member of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Accessibility. He is also a member of an internal NCC committee, which deals with physical, hearing and visual disabilities. The internal committee deals with the accessibility issues that arise in the design and\/or renovation of buildings. The NCC asked him to evaluate access at the York Street site in 1993 and 1994, and report on the possibility of a ramp. He was not involved in the original design of the stairs.\n[132] This led to a meeting on November 22, 1994, between NCC and Public Works to discuss the York steps. Mr. H\u00e9bert testified that security was foremost. The minutes of the meeting suggest otherwise, however. They state that:\n\u2026 mechanical options had been ruled out due to higher initial construction costs and the expense of ongoing maintenance and operation as well as the financial implications of renovation and maintenance in the long term.\nThis suggests that expense was the major concern. There is a letter from the NCC in 1999 that would support this understanding. The minutes also make it clear that someone raised the possibility of using the Connaught Building. This was never followed up.\n[133] Mr. H\u00e9bert then inspected the site. He had another meeting on December 13, 1994, with two persons from the Disabled Community Resource Centre and four from the NCC. Mr. H\u00e9bert advised the meeting that the slope of the hill made it very difficult to provide a ramp. The ramp would need a slope of 8\u00ba and be approximately 150 m. in length. Both of these factors would present a challenge for anyone in a wheelchair.\n[134] Mr. H\u00e9bert said that there were other problems. The ramp would have to run against the flow of pedestrian traffic up and down the steps. It was not a viable option. The problem was that this meant there was no access. Mr. H\u00e9bert wrote a memo to Mr. Kilgour, stating that alternative access would have to be provided at the steps. The memo says that the site should be totalement accessible. Les parcours alternatifs aux escaliers de la rue York permettra donc B toute la population de jouir de ce site.\n[135] There were concerns about security, however, particularly in the alley way between the steps and the Connaught Building. Part of the problem comes from the fact that the elevator is an enclosed space. It is easy to hide things in such a space. There was a discussion of whether a transparent elevator would pose the same threat to safety. Mr. H\u00e9bert said that these concerns arose after the Oklahoma bombing. He was later corrected and thought it was another bombing that prompted these concerns. It does not matter. There was a change in thinking. The concerns were there.\n[136] There were additional concerns with vandalism and with congestion in the narrow passageway between the building and the steps. There were trucks turning in the area. There would also be a problem at the top of the elevator, since it would require persons in wheelchairs to cross the flow of pedestrian traffic. The space for an elevator was very limited. But of course the CHRC says that the space was limited because of the design of the steps.\n[137] Mr. H\u00e9bert testified that the decision not to provide an elevator was ultimately made on the basis of security. It was impossible to have 24-hour security at the site. Mr. H\u00e9bert felt that this was an important consideration, since persons who cannot climb the stairs are more vulnerable than other persons. Mr. Brown took issue with this in cross-examination. He is an ardent believer in self-determination, a reference to the right of the disabled to make their own decisions in these matters. Mr. H\u00e9bert responded that the obligation of the NCC to protect the public takes precedence over the right of self-determination.\n[138] Mr. H\u00e9bert said that the developer who took over the Daly site suggested that an elevator at that site could be used as an alternative means of access. There was a discussion of routes and the flow of pedestrian traffic in the area. Mr. H\u00e9bert argued that an elevator at the York Street Steps would primarily service Major\u2019s Hill Park. Traffic to the Chateau Laurier or Parliament Hill would be handled more effectively at the Daly site.\n[139] Mr. H\u00e9bert was visibly uncomfortable in the witness box. He has loyalties to the NCC; but he also recognized that the York Street Steps simply do not accommodate those people who cannot climb the stairs. He agreed on cross-examination that persons with disabilities should be integrated into society. They should not be segregated. He recognized that the stairs divide people from each other.\n(v) Katie Paialunga [140] Katie Paialunga is employed as the Executive Director of the Independent Living Centre. The Centre provides support for persons with disabilities who live on their own. It has a clientele composed of persons with multiple disabilities, rather than persons with specific mobility problems. The Centre is often consulted by government and social organizations with respect to issues concerning persons with disabilities.\n[141] Ms. Paialunga is paraplegic and uses a wheelchair. She has done accessibility audits and is familiar with the principles employed in the process. The NCC asked for her advice on the York Street Steps after Mr. Brown lodged his complaint with the CHRC. She attended the meeting on July 23, 2002, in her capacity as Executive Director of the Centre.\n[142] There was a dispute about the appropriateness of consulting with the Independent Living Centre, and Ms. Paialunga in particular. Mr. Brown made the point that the Independent Living Centre is not an advocacy group. Nor does it have a particular expertise in mobility restrictions. Ms. Paialunga agreed that she was not an advocate. She also agreed that she did not attend the meeting as a representative of the disabled community. She was simply offering her opinion, as an informed person, who had a good working knowledge of the needs of persons with disabilities.\n[143] Ms. Paialunga felt that her participation in the meeting would come within her normal range of duties. Mr. Brown cross-examined her on this and clearly felt that she was there on her own. She did not discuss the matter with the Board of Directors until the final Accessibility Report came out and she found out that she would be testifying at the hearing.\n[144] The minutes of the meeting held on July 23rd were put into evidence through Ms. Paialunga. She stated that the purpose of the meeting was to choose which of the options in the draft Accessibility Report was the best. The options were presented by Mr. Martin. All of the options were discussed and there was a consensus, after the discussion, that the Daly-site option should be recommended. Ms. Paialunga did not feel that Mr. Martin or any of the official participants favoured a particular option.\n[145] The biggest concern was with safety. Everyone felt that the Daly site was the best site from this perspective. There were problems with the construction of an elevator at the steps. There were trucks. There was a dark alley way. Ms. Paialunga testified that she would not be comfortable going down the alley at night. She felt that a person could be trapped. She also had concerns about snow removal and the use of an outdoor elevator in freezing temperatures.\n[146] There was an additional issue with respect to the use of the service ramp beside the Connaught Building, where the proposed elevator would be located. Ms. Paialunga felt that it was degrading to put the access for disabled persons in a service entrance. Mr. Brown countered that he would rather have access at the service ramp than go down the block and around the Connaught Building. He described this as a question of self-determination.\n[147] Mr. Brown also cross-examined Ms. Paialunga with respect to the differences among those who have disabilities. He drew her attention to the extra effort that would be required of a quadriplegic, like himself, in negotiating his way through the Daly site and back up the other side to the top of the steps. Ms. Paialunga agreed that the level of effort required in using an alternative route was one of the major factors that should be taken into account in providing access.\n[148] Mr. Vigna cross-examined Ms. Paialunga for the CHRC. He referred to the minutes of the meeting, which suggested that Mr. Martin began by summarizing the various options and advising the participants that he felt the best option was the Daly site. The discussion went on from there. Ms. Paialunga felt that the minutes were misleading. She resisted Mr. Vigna\u2019s suggestion that the Daly site was presented as the best solution.\n[149] There was examination with respect to the precise order of what occurred at the meeting, which I do not propose to discuss. Elizabeth Norris, a representative from the Canadian Paraplegic Association, apparently suggested that the consultants had already concluded that the Daly site was the best option. This is backed up by the rest of the evidence. The testimony of Mr. Corush, Mr. Lajeunesse and Mr. H\u00e9bert makes it clear that the NCC and the consulting architects were already in favour of the Daly site.\n[150] It was probably inevitable that the position of the NCC would find its way into the meeting. I accept the CHRC\u2019s position that the minutes and the Accessibility report make it clear that the Daly site was presented as the preferred option. There were nevertheless questions regarding the details of the various proposals. These questions were sincere and inquiring. There was an exchange of views.\n[151] Ms. Paialunga acknowledged that expense was an issue. So were aesthetics. Her real concern, however, was with security. She said this was the decisive factor in recommending the Daly option. It was also the primary consideration in rejecting the installation of an elevator in the corridor between the existing steps and the Connaught Building. The participants at the meeting discussed the possibility of using the elevator in the Connaught Building, but it was with conditions attached, since it was assumed that a security guard would have to come down and unlock the door whenever someone wanted to use the elevator.\nC. Evidence For Public Works (i) Idelle Matte [152] Idelle Matte was called by Public Works to testify as to security issues regarding the site. She is the Corporate Security Director for Public Works and is responsible for the physical security of all leased government buildings in Canada. Ms. Matte testified that they have about 2800 buildings. They manage about two thousand of them.\n[153] Ms. Matte is trained as a Security Analyst. She had a 3-week security course with the RCMP and has received training in physical security. She has a certificate from the American Society for Industrial Security and a diploma from Algonquin College. She was contacted by Raymond Charette, the property manager for the Connaught Building, after the complaint was referred to the Tribunal, and asked to do a security analysis.\n[154] On April 29, 2004, Ms. Matte and Mr. Charette went through the Connaught building and did the analysis. They paid particular attention to the elevator in the north end of the building, which goes to the Minister\u2019s office. There were concerns with the security at this end of the building after the construction of the American Embassy. The building was not built to blast mitigation standards. Blast mitigation refers to the fact that a building can withstand an explosion (an external blast) without coming down. There was also a concern with the protective glazing on the windows of the building.\n[155] There are four security readiness levels for federal government facilities. These levels were brought in after the events of Sept. 11th, 2001. Security readiness level 1, the minimal standard, would require controlled access at the entrances of the building. It would also require identification. Level 2 would require guards at the entrances and visible identification. Visitors must be escorted. Mail must be scanned.\n[156] The Connaught Building is at level 2. This is the same as the Parliament Buildings. Ms. Matte noted that the building is a Mission critical building. It is also a heritage building. This increases any concerns. In theory, at least, members of the public who used the elevator in the Connaught Building, would have to be signed in and escorted through the building.\n[157] There are nevertheless different security zones. There may be, in ascending order, a public access zone, a reception zone, an operational zone, a security zone and perhaps a high security zone. This could conceivably have a bearing on the use of the elevator.\n[158] The memo prepared by Ms. Matte contained comments on the use of the existing elevator. It does not comment on the possibility of building another elevator. She nevertheless says that her comments would be the same, if the same elevator shaft was used.\nIII. Law [159] The present case raises a number of legal questions. These questions need to be answered before determining whether the case has been substantiated. They are also relevant on remedy.\nA. Are the York Street Steps a facility or service?[160] The first question concerns the wording of section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which reads as follows:\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\na) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\nb) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. 1976-77, c. 33, s. 5.\nThe NCC argues that the York Street Steps are none of these things. It submits, in particular, that a set of stairs is not a service or facility. The Steps accordingly fall outside the ambit of the Act.\n[161] I do not think, for myself, that it is necessary to go into the definitions of these words. I agree with Mr. Harnden that it would be wrong to describe the physical steps as a service or facility. That does not end the issue, however. Section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act refers to the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation, and it is the act of providing these things that comes within the scrutiny of the Act.\n[162] The legal issue on the wording of the Act is whether the NCC is providing a service in constructing and maintaining the steps. I have no doubt that it is. If the steps themselves are not a service, they provide one. This service consists of giving physical assistance to those who want to traverse the hill between Sussex Drive and MacKenzie Avenue.\n[163] The NCC is accordingly providing the steps, which at least linguistically provide the service. This is a continuing act, which comes within the natural ambit of section 5. The service in question is customarily available to the general public. It follows that the Act applies and the NCC is prohibited, as the custodian of the steps, from differentiating adversely in relation to those who have disabilities.\nB. Section 15 [164] The usual defence to an allegation that a Respondent has failed to provide accommodation arises under section 15(1)(g) and 15(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The former provision reads:\n15. (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(g) in the circumstances described in section 5 or 6, an individual is denied any goods, services, facilities or accommodation or access thereto \u2026 and there is bona fide justification for that denial or differentiation.\nThe allegation is that the NCC has denied the Complainant access to the service provided by the York Street Steps.\n[165] Section 15(2) elaborates upon the meaning of a bona fide justification.\n(2) For any practice mentioned \u2026 in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\nThe practice in question is the construction of the York Street Steps without the provision of access for those who cannot climb the stairs. This practice has a bona fide justification if the provision of access would impose undue hardship on the Respondents, considering health, safety and cost.\n(i) Are the factors in s. 15(2) exhaustive? [166] There are two specific questions that need to be answered in the present case. The first is whether factors other than health, safety and cost can be consulted in determining whether the provision of access would impose an undue hardship on the Respondents under s. 15(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act? I think the answer is yes. The factors listed in the subsection are not exhaustive.\n[167] The Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec dealt with the same question in Syndicat des employ\u00e9es et employ\u00e9s professionnelles et professionnels de bureau, section locale 434 (FTQ) c. Gagnon, [2005] J.Q. no 9368. There, the court was dealing with an employee who had been dismissed, in part because of medical absenteeism. The employee filed a grievance, relying expressly on the provisions in section 15 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[168] The facts of the case are not particularly helpful. At para. 39 of the decision, however, Justice Marcelin found that the list of factors in s. 15(2) is not exhaustive.\nLe paragraphe (2) de l'article 15 est descriptif et non limitatif. Il peut y avoir d'autres crit\u00e8res qui permettent une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\nThe decision of Justice Marcelin seems to rest on the simple observation that it is possible to conceive of legitimate employment factors\u2014that is to say, bona fide occupational requirements\u2014 that do not come under the heading of health, safety and cost.\n[169] A similar question arose in Dominion Colour Corp. v. Teamsters, Local 1880 (Metcalfe Grievance), [1999] O.L.A.A. No. 688, 83 L.A.C. (4th) 330, where the arbitrator reviewed the equivalent provision in the Ontario Human Rights Code. The factual issue in the case was whether the employer was able to accommodate a pregnant employee who could not work in an area exposed to lead.\n[170] The arbitrator in Dominion found that the statutory factors listed in the relevant provisions were not exhaustive. She relied, in this regard, on the decision of Madam Justice Wilson in Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489. There, the Supreme Court of Canada expressed the view that the anticipated reaction of the workforce and the possible impact on general employee morale should be considered, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on a Respondent. This would take a Tribunal beyond the factors in s. 15(2).\n[171] In Central Alberta Dairy Pool, Madam Justice Wilson writes that a list of factors is not intended to be exhaustive. I think the implication is that any attempt to list the full range of factors that might apply in determining what constitutes undue hardship is destined to fail. This is an important observation in the immediate case.\n[172] The factors in s. 15(2) appear to be employment factors. Health and safety are workplace issues. The subsection does not capture the range of issues and concerns that arise in the construction of buildings, the preservation of historical sites, and the provision of public amenities. It seems to me that the kinds of considerations that arise in the case of the York Street Steps are substantially different than the issues that arise in the case of hiring or promotion.\n[173] I do not believe that the subsection excludes the possibility of other factors. Section 15(2) does not say that health, safety and costs are the only factors that may be considered, in deciding what form of accommodation is required. This is significant in the present case because some of the factors that naturally arise in the context of accommodation arise outside s. 15(2).\n[174] There may be an additional point here. The Canadian Human Rights Act is remedial. I think it is a mistake to interpret those provisions that place responsibilities on Respondents too rigidly. The objective is to remove discrimination, not to create artificial criteria, which only impede any assessment of the rights and responsibilities that come into play in the area.\n(ii) The mandate of the NCC must be respected [175] The principal concern in the present case is that the National Capital Commission has its own mandate under the National Capital Act. This gives rise to legitimate concerns, which need to be consulted in determining the issues that arise under section 15 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The scope of these concerns can be considered, if necessary, some other time.\n[176] The Canadian Human Rights Act has a special status, which takes it out of the sphere reserved for ordinary legislation. Other statutes must be read in a way that conforms to both the general purpose and express provisions of the Act. The NCC is obliged to carry out its mandate in a manner that is consistent with the obligations of the Crown under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[177] I think there is a corollary to this proposition, however. The Canadian Human Rights Act does not exist in isolation from other legal instruments that might have a bearing on a particular situation. I am not aware of anything in the Canadian Human Rights Act that would annul or somehow diminish the responsibilities of the NCC under the National Capital Act. On the contrary, I believe the principle of statutory consistency requires that the National Capital Act and the Canadian Human Rights Act be read as complimentary pieces of legislation.\n[178] It follows that the statutory obligations of the NCC must be taken into account, in deciding what constitutes reasonable accommodation under s. 15(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. This is significant because it became apparent in the course of the hearing that historical and aesthetic factors were important considerations in the case.\n[179] The law states that the determination of what constitutes reasonable accommodation requires a balancing of factors. This can only be done after the parties have participated in a proper process of accommodation, which brings these factors to the surface. As I understand it, the NCC believes that it has a legal obligation to consider historical, cultural, and aesthetic factors in deciding how to develop the sites that come under its administration.\n[180] I think the legal concept of accommodation is large enough to include the idea that access should be provided in a way that respects the architectural and aesthetic values that come into play at a particular site. I accept the evidence of the architects that it is important to protect the view-shed. I accept the evidence that steps should match the American Embassy. These kinds of considerations come within the normal parameters of such projects.\nC. The prima facie test [181] The second question raised by section 15(2) concerns the prima facie test. I recently dealt with the test in Sosnowski v. PWGSC, 2005 CHRT 47 (2005\/12\/09) and do not propose to add much here. The present case is nevertheless distinguishable from Sosnowski, since it arises under section 15 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[182] The conventional analysis in the law of human rights holds that the Complainant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. There must be some evidence that the Complainant requires accommodation. Once this is established, the burden of proof in the case shifts to the Respondent, who is required to establish that this would impose an undue hardship under subsection 15(2).\n[183] I have made it clear in Sosnowski that I think the conventional analysis is wrong. In my view, the fundamental burden of proof--sometimes called the legal or the persuasive burden\u2014in a case of discrimination remains on the person alleging the discrimination throughout the course of the hearing. The prosecuting party must prove its case. The legal burden does not shift.\n[184] The CHRC takes a different position. Mr. Dufresne referred me to Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Maksteel Qu\u00e9bec Inc., [2003] 3 S.C.R. 228, at para. 53, where the Supreme Court certainly seems to assume that the burden shifts to the Respondent. The problem is that the Court does not seriously discuss the issue. It is clear, moreover, at the end of the decision, that the Supreme Court places the legal burden on the Complainant.\n[185] I prefer the position of the NCC. Mr. Harnden referred me to a passage from the loose-leaf edition of William Pentney, ed., Discrimination and the Law (Thompson Carswell), at \u00a715.2(d)(iii). Once a prima facie case has been made out, Mr. Pentney states:\n... the respondent bears the responsive onus of coming forward with some evidence if the [respondent] is going to avoid the risk of a finding being made against him per McDonald, J. in BaseFort Patrol Ltd. v. Alberta Human Rights Commission (1982), 4 CHRR D\/1200. In a secondary sense, however, the ultimate or legal burden of proof never shifts from the complainant.\nIt is difficult to imagine a more basic rule of law, which guarantees the justice and fairness of the process.\n[186] The original purpose of the prima facie test was to determine, at the close of the case for prosecuting party, if there was a case to meet. If a prima facie case was established, the court went on to decide the case on the merits. The Respondent was required to lead evidence or take the risk, per McDonald J., of a finding against it. A Respondent who calls evidence is essentially working on the assumption that there is a prima facie case.\n[187] I have already explained this aspect of the matter in Sosnowski.The prima facie test was historically employed at the close of the case for the prosecuting party. It was never designed to be used at the end of the case, after both sides have led evidence. The problem is that the use of the test at this stage of the process inevitably obscures the real task of the Tribunal. That is merely to determine, on all the evidence, whether the Complainant has proven his case on a balance of probabilities.\n[188] It is not clear why so much of the caselaw seems to adopt the position that the burden of proof\u2014and here I mean the legal burden\u2014shifts to the Respondent once a prima facie case has been established. The only explanation I can think of is that many Tribunals have implicitly assumed that the Complainant has met some burden in meeting the prima facie test. This is clearly wrong.\n[189] The evidence is not weighed on the prima facie test. There is no burden of proof. The Complainant may have a doubtful case, a poor case, dare I say a bad case, and have no difficulty establishing a prima facie case. The Complainant may go on and lose the case on the merits, even if the Respondent calls no evidence. Why, then, should the legal burden shift? I cannot find a satisfactory answer to this question. There is nothing in the prima facie test that is sufficient to displace the burden of proof and place evidentiary obligations on the Respondent.\n[190] This does not change the statutory requirements under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 15(2) does not, however, place an explicit burden on the Respondent. It merely states:\n(2) For any practice mentioned \u2026 in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\nI think this is directed as much to the Tribunal as the parties. It admonishes the members of the Tribunal not to speculate.\n[191] The defence provided by s. 15(2) is merely that it would be unreasonable to expect the Respondent to accommodate the Complainant.From a practical perspective, a Respondent will probably find it difficult to establish this without leading evidence. Any onus on the Respondent is a rhetorical or explanatory onus, however, rather than a burden of proof. I say this because there must be cases where it can be established that accommodation would cause undue hardship without the Respondent calling any evidence whatsoever.\n[192] Mr. Pentney prefers to use the distinction between legal and evidentiary burdens. This performs much the same function. It places an explanatory obligation on the Respondent, while keeping the legal burden on the Complainant. The point is the same in either case. If the Respondent fails to provide an explanation under s. 15(2), a Tribunal may draw an adverse inference against it. In law, at least, this kind of inference can be construed as positive proof of discrimination.\n[193] I am not sure that there is even any reason to go this far. After all, if the sum total of the evidence before the Tribunal is that the Complainant is entitled to accommodation, and the Respondent has not provided an explanation, I cannot see why the Tribunal would dismiss a complaint. Indeed, I would have thought that section 15(2) requires that the complaint be substantiated.\n[194] There may be other ways of analyzing the situation. I remain convinced, however, that the legal burden remains where it was at the beginning of the process. As Mr. Pentney writes, in the same passage:\n... the distinctions involved in this issue, between statutory defences of exceptions and other defences, and between legal and evidentiary burdens must be scrupulously maintained if Board of Inquiry proceedings are to satisfy commonly accepted standards of fairness ...\nIt follows that a Tribunal should be careful not to assign evidentiary obligations to the Respondent that might have the effect of reversing the legal burden.\nD. Meiorin: the principles of universal design [195] Then there is an issue with respect to the general approach that should be adopted to the present case. The CHRC has asked me to apply the criteria in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3, usually referred to eponymously, as Meiorin. Aside from the factual differences between the two cases, I think the present case is relatively simple and does not require that kind of analysis.\n[196] Some of the comments in Meiorin are nevertheless more general in their application. At para. 68, for example, the Supreme Court writes:\nBy enacting human rights statutes and providing that they are applicable to the workplace, the legislatures have determined that the standards governing the performance of work should be designed to reflect all members of society, in so far as this is reasonably possible. Courts and tribunals must bear this in mind when confronted with a claim of employment-related discrimination. To the extent that a standard unnecessarily fails to reflect the differences among individuals, it runs afoul of the prohibitions contained in the various human rights statutes and must be replaced.\nThere is a point of comparison in the physical standards adopted by the NCC with respect to the developments that come under its control.\n[197] All of the parties have accepted that the principles of universal design provide the framework that should be used in determining the form of accommodation that is appropriate in a particular case. The NCC regularly advises other government departments of their obligation to respect and abide these principles.\n[198] There is a legal point here. The principles of universal design derive from the same notion of equality that lies at the heart of the Canadian Human Rights Act. It seems to me that the principles of universal design can be seen as a natural elaboration of the notion of equality, outside the law, in the field of architecture and planning. I do not see why they cannot be given the same kind of force that custom and practice is given in other areas of the law.\n[199] There is a minor issue here. It became evident during the hearing that the principles of universal design can be formulated in a number of ways. This does not seem to violate the general consensus that exists as to the basic tenets that should be included in any compilation of these principles. For the purposes of the present case, I think it is best to make use of the appendix attached to Mr. Rapson\u2019s report, which contains a convenient summary of these principles.\nE. The duty to accommodate: reasonableness [200] The caselaw dealing with accommodation has focused primarily on the bona fide exceptions. For myself, at least, I think it is better to begin with a general statement of the law. That statement is simply that the Respondent is required to provide reasonable accommodation under s. 15 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. It would be unreasonable to require something further.\n[201] I agree with this position of the NCC on the point. The obligations in the Act do not go beyond the requirement that a Respondent provide reasonable accommodation. The NCC is legally obliged to provide Mr. Brown and those who cannot climb the York Street stairs with a reasonable alternative. That is all it is obliged to do.\n[202] The Supreme Court of Canada has already recognized that there is only one standard of accommodation. In Commission scolaire r\u00e9gionale de Chambly v. Bergevin [1994] 2 S.C.R. 525, at p. 546. Cory J. writes, in referring to the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms:\nIt is important to remember that the duty to accommodate is limited by the words reasonable and short of undue hardship. Those words do not constitute independent criteria. Rather they are alternate methods of expressing the same concept.\nJustice Cory then refers to an equivalent passage in Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, at 984.\n[203] The Supreme Court has made it clear that the concept of undue hardship does not create an independent legal standard. That legal standard is reasonableness. Any interpretation of the term undue hardship that imposes an unreasonable burden on a Respondent cannot be supported.\n[204] The difficulty seems to lie in the fact that the reasonableness of a particular form of accommodation is relative. It depends on the situation. The concept of undue hardship accordingly provides a measuring stick, which a Tribunal can use to determine when the Complainant is asking too much.\n[205] I would assume that Parliament chose undue hardship as the standard arbiter because the provision of accommodation will inevitably entail some level of hardship. This is inescapable. I do not think it was the intention of Parliament, however, to do away with the standard of reasonableness.It is the standard of reasonableness that is definitive and not the concept of undue hardship. Mr. Harnden has relied on Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of Environment), [2003] 4 F.C. 580, where the Court held that the question of undue hardship does not arise if a Respondent offers a Complainant reasonable alternatives. I think this is another way of saying the same thing.\n[206] The decision in Hutchinson nevertheless illustrates that there are at least two lines of defence. The first line of defence is that the Respondent has acted reasonably. The NCC submits in the present case that it has provided the Complainant with reasonable accommodation. The second line is that the demand for accommodation would impose undue hardship on the Respondent under s. 15(2). The legal implication is that this is unreasonable.\n[207] The distinction between the two lines of defence seems to have collapsed in the caselaw, which has tended to rest everything on the statutory exception. It is true there is an overlap. There are elements of both lines of defence in the case before me. The major argument of the NCC is that the elevator at the Daly site provides reasonable accommodation. The defence of undue hardship is nevertheless there, in the background.\n[208] The only point I wish to make is that the two lines of defence are distinguishable. It follows that the first line of defence does not require any evidence of undue hardship. This may seem advantageous to a Respondent, since it keeps the burden of proof in the case squarely on the Complainant. The difference is illusory, however, if the Tribunal keeps the legal burden of proof where the law has historically said that it must be kept.\n[209] The determination of what is reasonable is specific to the circumstances of each case. I have been referred to the loose-leaf edition of The Duty to Accommodate in Employment (Canada Law Book), ed. Kevin D. MacNeill, at \u00a7. 11:30, where the editor cites authority for the proposition that the determination of what constitutes undue hardship requires a balancing of factors and a process of weighing.All of the relevant factors must be taken into account and weighed against each other, in deciding whether a particular form of accommodation is reasonable. It seems to me that there is a question of proportionality bound up in this. This requires an exercise of judgement, which is the particular responsibility of the Tribunal, and goes to the heart of the adjudicative process.\n[210] These comments should not be misapplied. I was also referred to Re Mount Sinai Hospital and Ontario Nurses\u2019 Association (1996), 54 LAC (4th) 261, where the Nurses\u2019 Association was seeking a nursing position for an injured employee. The panel of arbitrators held, at p. 273, that the cost of accommodation must be compared with the resulting benefit, to determine whether it constitutes an undue hardship. They then suggested that the hardship would be undue in cases where the disadvantage removed by accommodating an employee would be very small in relation to the cost of eliminating it.\n[211] This kind of analogy is of little assistance in the immediate case. The NCC created the disadvantage that it is now charged with removing. It would be wrong to let it rely on its own failure to fulfill its responsibilities and argue that the disadvantage is too small to justify the cost of correcting it. It is against public policy to allow a party to raise its own failure under the Act as a defence to a complaint of discrimination.\nF. The duty to consult [212] The duty to accommodate includes a duty to consult. The CHRC has submitted that the NCC must demonstrate that it followed proper process. This is probably the major issue in the case.\n[213] Most of the discussion of the duty to consult in the caselaw deals with employment. In Conte v. Rogers Cablesystems Ltd., (1999) T.D. 4\/99, at para. 77, for example, this Tribunal held:\nIt is the employer who has charge of the workplace and thus is expected to initiate the process of accommodation. At the very least, the employer is required to engage in an examination of the employee\u2019s current medical condition, the prognosis for recovery and the employee\u2019s capabilities for alternative work.\nI think this provides some idea of the obligations on a Respondent in cases concerning access.\n[214] The analogy between cases of employment and cases of physical access is imperfect. The obligation to accommodate an employee arises out of the legal relationship between an employer and an employee. There are responsibilities and duties on both sides. The obligations of a public agency like the NCC to provide access to a public park are free-standing and different in kind.\n[215] The most relevant authority in the area appears to be the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Grismer, indexed as British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868. In Grismer, the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles cancelled the Complainant\u2019s driver\u2019s licence because he suffered from a condition known as homonymous hemianopia, which eliminated almost all of his left-side peripheral vision. Anyone with this condition was barred from holding a licence.\n[216] The issue in the case was accommodation. The B.C. Council of Human Rights ordered the Superintendent to give Mr. Grismer an individual assessment to determine whether he was entitled to a licence, and whether restrictions should be placed on any licence. The case was appealed, and eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, which applied the Meiorin criteria.\n[217] The ratio decidendi of the case is much simpler, however. At para. 44, Chief Justice McLaughlin wrote:\nThis case deals with no more than the right to be accommodated. It does not decide that Mr. Grismer had the right to a driver's licence. It merely [page894] establishes that he had a right to be assessed. That was all the Member [of the B.C. Council of Human Rights] found and all that we assert. The discrimination here lies not in the refusal to give Mr. Grismer a driver's licence, but in the refusal to even permit him to attempt to demonstrate that his situation could be accommodated without jeopardizing the Superintendent's goal of reasonable road safety.\nThe Superintendent of Motor Vehicles had not offered so much as a gesture in the direction of accommodation.\n[218] The situation before me in the present case concerns the public at large rather than an individual. There are nevertheless parallels with Grismer. Mr. Brown and the CHRC says that there was no real investigation of the situation. I do not accept this. I nevertheless agree that the NCC did not enter into a proper round of consultations. There was no real airing of the views of the people who needed the accommodation.\n[219] The parallels with Grismer are real. At para. 43 of Grismer, the Chief Justice writes that the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles:\n... was obliged to give Mr. Grismer the opportunity to prove whether or not he could drive safely, by assessing Mr. Grismer individually.\nThe failure to consult with Mr. Grismer and give him an opportunity to address the matter was itself discriminatory. It follows that the charge of discrimination under the Human Rights Act was established.\n[220] I take it from Grismer that the first obligation to accommodate is obligation to enter into a proper process of consultation. The Respondent must inquire into the matter and obtain the views of the persons who require accommodation. I would go further and say that there is an element of natural justice in this process. There must be an open exchange of views and the persons who require accommodation should be given an opportunity to reply to any concerns that might prevent the Respondent from providing the accommodation that they are seeking.\n[221] The NCC has an obligation to inform itself of situations that might potentially discriminate against persons who have disabilities. There is a further duty to investigate these situations and canvass the possible solutions. This includes a duty to openly and sincerely consult the community of individuals that may be affected. The process of consultation must be meaningful: the legitimate concerns and views of the community must be taken into consideration, in deciding what accommodation is appropriate.\n[222] I realize that the defence before me is that the Respondent has provided reasonable accommodation. This may or may not have a bearing on the duty to consult. I would nevertheless think that some degree of consultation is a necessary element in any process of accommodation. It seems to me that a Respondent will have to discuss the matter with the person seeking accommodation, if only to determine what form of accommodation is appropriate. In any event, the process followed in the present case was insufficient.\n[223] I would make one final comment. The NCC recognized, in all fairness, that public consultation is an integral part of barrier-free design. It also cited caselaw for the proposition that the process of consultation is collaborative. The other parties should be given an ample opportunity to participate. This is all to the good. At the end of the day, however, all of the parties need to recognize that the NCC is the custodian of the York Street Steps. It is the NCC that has the legal responsibility to make decisions with respect to the design, control and maintenance of the site at the York Street Steps.\nIV. Liability:The Case Against The NCC [224] The law of the person and human rights starts with the recognition that everyone is equal. It follows that any analysis of the present case must start with the proposition that the NCC\u2019s obligation to maintain and develop the National Capital Region must be interpreted in a way that treats persons with disabilities the same as other persons. Everyone has the same right to access under s. 2 of the Act.\n[225] The NCC has an obligation to accommodate those persons who cannot climb the York Street Steps. This obligation includes a duty to consult, in some manner, with individuals, associations, and groups who can voice the views and concerns of these persons. There is no rigid rule as to who should be consulted.\n[226] The main issue before me in the present case is whether the process of consultation was legally adequate. It was not. I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the NCC failed to meet its obligations under the Canadian Human Rights Act. It does not seem right to say that the process of consultation was unreasonable. It seems more accurate to say that it was insufficient.\n[227] I am also satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the NCC is discriminating against Mr. Brown and other persons with disabilities. There are a number of observations that contribute to these findings.\nA. The York Street Steps are not accessible [228] The first observation is that the York Street Steps are not accessible. This is a factual and legal finding.The NCC has not provided any accommodation for people who cannot climb the stairs. Mr. Brown and people with disabilities have no means of climbing the hill and gaining entry to Major\u2019s Hill Park at the York Street Steps. The Steps accordingly discriminate against them.\n[229] The NCC implied in its final submissions that it was unnecessary to provide access at the Steps. The Respondents argued that the flow of pedestrian traffic up the steps is generally towards the Chateau Laurier and Parliament Hill, rather than Major\u2019s Hill Park. The Daly site would better serve these persons. There is no issue about any of this. Even Mr. Rapson agreed that the route through the Daly-site was preferable for people who were going to Parliament Hill.\n[230] The position on the other side is simply that the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits the NCC from differentiating between people who can climb the steps and people who cannot climb them. The issue is parity. The NCC cannot say that persons with disabilities do not need access to Major\u2019s Hill Park at York and Sussex. If people with disabilities do not need access to Major\u2019s Hill Park, the same can be said of those who do not have disabilities. The public interest is the same in both cases.\n[231] The question before me is accordingly quite simple. It is whether the NCC has discriminated against those persons with disabilities, like Mr. Brown, who want the same access to Major\u2019s Hill Park as other members of the public. The response from the NCC is that the Daly site is sufficient. The evidence does not bear this out.\n[232] Mr. Rapson\u2019s evidence was that the Daly site elevator was simply too far. It is not equitable and therefore contravenes one of the basic principles of universal design. The distance to be traversed\u2014by those who have the most difficulty traversing it\u2014presents a real problem. It seems to me that any extra burden should be placed on the individuals who are best able to deal with it.\n[233] Mr. Martin testified that the Daly site would require an additional travel distance of 284 metres. That is 284 metres that other people do not have to travel. The provision of an elevator a hundred metres down the road does not provide meaningful accommodation. Half that distance would be too far. I am satisfied that the Canadian Human Rights Act requires accommodation within the close proximity of the steps and not a block away.\n[234] Perhaps it is a matter of language. I do not understand how it can be said that the elevator at the Daly site provides a person in a wheelchair with access to Major\u2019s Hill Park at the York Street Steps. Some things are common sense. The Daly site is another location altogether. The elevator at the Daly site may provide access to Major\u2019s Hill Park from down the street, but it is stretching the facts to say that it provides accommodation at the York Street Steps. There is simply no access at the York Street Steps.\n[235] The evidence is really that persons with disabilities have to make a detour that others do not have to make. They have to take another route and go another way. This is not a reasonable form of accommodation. The truth is that the NCC simply assumed from the beginning that it would be sufficient to provide access at the Daly site. This was a legal error. I do not see how it can be said that the provision of the elevator at the Daly site provides the accommodation required by the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[236] The facts of each case are different. It is common ground, however, that the NCC has a duty to provide reasonable accommodation. I think it follows, purely as a matter or logic, that a Respondent should provide the access required by people with disabilities as near as possible to the place where it is required. It would be unreasonable to do anything less. Any access should be equitable and proximate, and in keeping with the principles of universal access.\n[237] The social issue here is separation. The Canadian Human Rights Act is based on the principle that people should be treated equally. The implication is that people should be treated, as much as possible, in the same way. It runs against the spirit of the Act to separate persons with disabilities from other people in situations where it is unnecessary to do so. This is a matter of dignity, physically and psychologically. It reminds people with disabilities that they don't fit in.\n[238] I am satisfied on the facts of the present case that any access at the York Street Steps should be provided in the immediate vicinity of the steps, and probably on site. There is some room for interpretation. It seems to me that the Connaught Building might be considered part of the same site as the York Street Steps for the purposes of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[239] There was at least a suggestion in the evidence that the provision of access at the Steps themselves would impose undue hardship on the NCC.This was fragmentary and vague, however. It was not sufficient to provide a defence.\nB. The process of consultation was deficient [240] The second observation is that the process of consultation was deficient. The NCC was obliged to seek the input of groups or associations who can be legitimately said to represent persons with disabilities. The interests of the disabled community need to be considered throughout the process of design and construction.\n[241] The NCC\u2019s response is that it consulted the disabled community in designing the York Street Steps. There were meetings with the identified stakeholders. This included the City of Ottawa Accessibility Advisory Committee, the Canadian Paraplegic Association, the Disabled Persons Community Resources, and the Independent Living Centre. There was some attempt to obtain the views of the disabled community. The truth, however, is that these discussions were sparse and incomplete.\n[242] The process of consultation did not proceed very far. It seems to have been designed, intentionally or not, to bring these participants on side. There was only one meeting, on July 23, 2002 that could be considered a proper consultation. The conduct of the meeting has been questioned and there was nothing like the transparent public process that one would hope to see in such a case.\n[243] The meeting was essentially closed. Mr. Brown was not invited. It was suggested by the NCC that this was at the suggestion of a conciliator for the CHRC. I find this difficult to comprehend. It appears that the NCC did not want him at the meeting. He had become an adversary.\n[244] There are two views of what occurred at the meeting. Ms. Paialunga testified that there was a consensus that the Daly site was the best option. I suppose it is a matter of degree. There was no compulsion, but it is clear that the views of the NCC and the consultants infiltrated the process. The process favoured the Daly site. Mr. Warren and the Municipal Advisory Committee were never really given an opportunity to express their views.\n[245] The process of consultation was constrained by many factors, not the least of which was that the meeting on July 23, 2002 proceeded on a false set of assumptions. One of these assumptions was that the elevator at the Daly site would provide a reasonable form of accommodation. This was never open for discussion. Another assumption was that the Connaught Building was out of the question. Another was that the parties had to choose between the options set out in the Robertson Report.\n[246] These kinds of limits are out of keeping with the kind of inquiry contemplated by the Canadian Human Rights Act. It was clear from Ms. Paialunga\u2019s testimony that she felt the choice was between the Daly site and the elevator beside the steps. It was one or the other, and what could she do? She was concerned about the safety of an elevator at the steps and did not want to lose the Daly option.\n[247] Mr. Brown and Ms. Paialunga debated the philosophical side of the issue. Mr Brown felt that the principle of self-determination should take precedence over other considerations. If the only feasible location for an elevator at the steps was between the Steps and the Connaught Building, he was in favour of it. Access down a dark alley is better than no access at all. Persons with disabilities should be able to decide for themselves whether they want to use the access that is provided.\n[248] There is a real disconnection here, however. I do not see why there had to be a choice between an elevator at the Daly site and the York Street Steps. The elevator at the Daly site was a separate matter. It may or may not have been built, whatever was done at the Steps, and it was wrong of the NCC to put this kind of choice to the disabled community. I am satisfied that this seriously undermined the veracity of the process.\n[249] I am not sure that I even understand why the elevator at the Daly site would be included in a list of possible solutions to the problem of access at the York Street Steps. I know that the NCC was looking at the entire block, rather than the junction of York Street and Sussex Drive. This kind of approach is generally inappropriate in the context of access, however, which is usually specific to a particular site.\n[250] I realize that it was not an easy situation for the NCC. It does not really matter at the end of the day. The NCC was obliged to consult with the relevant parties, and keep consulting, until all of the reasonable alternatives were exhausted. It is impossible to know where a collaborative, open-ended round of consultations might have led.\nC. The real problem lies in the design of the York Street Steps [251] The third observation is that the real problem lies in the design of the York Street Steps. I think this was the broader position taken by the witnesses for the Complainant and the CHRC. Mr. Rapson, for example, felt that there was an opportunity to address the accessibility issues when the new steps were designed. This was a missed opportunity.\n[252] Mr. Warren also testified that the Daly site was presented as the only viable option at the meeting on July 23, 2002. This was frustrating because it did not deal with the real problem, which was the failure to build an accessible set of stairs. The Daly elevator was the best option that was presented, but only because the steps themselves were not made accessible at the time they were built as they should have been. None of the options presented at the meeting in July 2002 dealt with the real problem, which was the original design of the steps. There was very little that the Municipal Advisory Committee or anyone else could do.\n[253] I think the testimony of Mr. H\u00e9bert and Mr. Martin backs this up. The NCC, for its part, has essentially admitted that the York Street Steps were constructed without access, on the rather vague understanding that an elevator would probably be provided at the Daly site. This merely proves the point: the NCC was prepared to build the steps without access, on the basis that it could somehow remedy the situation in the future. It seems to me that this idea openly contravenes s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[254] The matter was compounded by the subsequent conduct of the NCC. Although there were consultations after the complaint was filed, Mr. Martin testified that there was no question of rebuilding the Steps. That was off the table. This merely put the real problem out of reach. The difficulty with the options presented at the meeting on July 23, 2002 were really secondary. If the proposed elevator, for example, was down a dark alleyway and potentially unsafe, that can be attributed to the design of the Steps. The problem lies in the initial construction.\n[255] I want to be fair. The testimony of Jerrold Corush makes it clear that the NCC studied the problem of providing access when the stairs were built. The problem is that it did so on its own, without a proper round of consultations, and without appreciating the full extent of its obligations under the Canadian Human Rights Act. These obligations existed at the location of the steps: the decision to make use of the elevator at the Daly site was really a way of side-stepping them.\n[256] None of the parties disputed the fact that the York Street Steps were built without any access. This is where the discrimination lies and I do not see how the provision of an alternative route through the Daly site corrects it. Even if the development of the Daly site has corrected the situation\u2014and it has not\u2014the NCC has discriminated against the Complainant in the years between the completion of the steps and the construction of the Daly elevator.\nD. Conclusions [257] I have reached the following conclusions. The York Street Steps are a public amenity, built in a prominent location, for the benefit of visitors and residents alike. One of the benefits that they provide is access to Major\u2019s Hill Park, which boasts a scenic view of the Rideau locks and Parliament Hill. This access has not been provided to people who are disabled.\n[258] The NCC required that an elevator be installed at the Daly site. There were advantages to the use of the Daly site. The elevator would be available twenty-four hours a day. The York Street site is more exposed to the elements than the Daly site; the Daly site would be safer and probably more convenient for people who want to visit Parliament Hill. It is all beside the point. The situation at the Steps remain the same as it was before the Daly site was constructed.\n[259] The Daly site provides little more than a detour. The access provided by the elevator at the Daly site requires people who have difficulty walking, for example, to walk around the Connaught Building. Where is the equity, fairness or logic in this? There may be an elevator in the middle of the detour, but the detour itself is unfair and does not provide a reasonable form of accommodation.\n[260] The York Street Steps present a barrier to people with disabilities. It is evident that people who cannot climb the steps do not have the same access to Major\u2019s Hill Park as other people. The NCC has not provided reasonable accommodation. I accordingly find that the NCC, in building and maintaining the steps, has discriminated against Mr. Brown and people with disabilities under s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[261] Mr. Corush testified that the project at York and Sussex was to get people up the hill. The finished steps invite visitors and residents alike to climb the hill and investigate the park, the view it holds, and the precincts of the Parliament Buildings. It is the NCC that has invited the public to enjoy the area. Under the Canadian Human Rights Act, it must extend this invitation to those who cannot climb the steps.\n[262] The caselaw recognizes that it is impossible to determine what form of accommodation is appropriate without a process of inquiry and consultation that explores the matter. There are engineering issues that must be considered. There are aesthetic, historical, security and safety issues. There is a point, at least, where costs have to be considered.\n[263] The consultations that took place in the past were insufficient. They did not explore the matter properly. They did not give the public or the disabled community a real opportunity to contribute to the process. They did not exhibit that level of engagement that characterizes a meaningful process of consultation. The party with the responsibility to decide the issue must be willing to change its view or alter its approach to the matter.\n[264] The important thing at this late stage is to rectify the situation. I think, moreover, that the solution is relatively simple. The NCC needs to return to the process of accommodation and continue its consultations. The other parties have a legal obligation to participate sincerely and honestly in the negotiations. At this stage, at least, it is not for the Tribunal to determine what form of access would constitute reasonable accommodation.\n[265] This deserves emphasis. The NCC remains the effective owner of the site. It has all the prerogatives that come with that ownership. At the end of the day, it is the NCC that has the responsibility and indeed the privilege of deciding on the appropriate accommodation. This does not reduce its obligations. The process of accommodation must be collaborative.\nV. Liability:The Case Against Public Works And Government Services [266] I am also satisfied on a balance of probabilities, that the failure of Public Works and Government Services to participate properly in the process of accommodating Mr. Brown is a discriminatory form of conduct. This constitutes a contravention of s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Public Works has raised a number of issues in its defence.\nA. Public Works is not immune from a finding of liability [267] The first issue is preliminary and requires explanation. Mr. Rapson testified in the early part of the hearing that the Connaught Building, which is apparently owned by Public Works, provided the natural means of providing access at the site. This led the CHRC to make a motion that Public Works be added as a party to the litigation. I allowed the motion.\n[268] In its written argument, Public Works has now taken the position that it was not a party to the original litigation. This, it submits, prevents the Tribunal from making a finding of liability against it. Mr. Lester then goes on to argue that the Complainant and the CHRC cannot seek a remedy against Public Works without a finding of liability.\n[269] I have already dealt with the first point, in adding Public Works Government Services Canada as a party to the complaint. Section 48.9(2)(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act clearly contemplates the addition of parties. I would note that the hearing was adjourned and Public Works was given ample time to inform itself of the facts and particulars of the case. It can no longer complain that it was prejudiced by the fact that it was not a party to the original litigation.\n[270] The emphasis in the Canadian Human Rights Act is on finding a remedy. If that means bringing in an agency of the Crown, in the circumstances that arise before me, I think the Act directs me to do so. The whole point of adding Public Works as a co-Respondent was to make sure that all of the possible solutions to the problem could be properly investigated. The Connaught Building cannot be considered for the purposes of providing access unless Public Works is a party to the hearing.\n[271] I nevertheless accept the submission of Public Works on the second point. I think that Mr. Lester was right in his reading of section 53(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which only gives the Tribunal the authority to make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice. This only shifts the inquiry, however, and raises the question whether the failure to assist the NCC and ultimately the CHRC in resolving the complaint is sufficient to ground liability. I think it is.\n[272] The Federal Court had no difficulty with a finding of liability against a union in Goyette v. Voyageur Colonial Ltee, [1999] FCJ. No. 1678; 2000 CLLC 230-021, on the basis that it had negotiated agreements with the employer that were discriminatory. Pinard J. relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Renaud v. Central Okanagan School District No. 23, [1999] 2 SCR 970, at page 989, where the court commented that a union which causes or contributes to the discriminatory effect incurs liability.\n[273] I think the decision in Goyette reflects the fact that there are situations where it is impossible to deal adequately with a complaint without bringing in a third party. I would not want to take this too far. The alternative, however, is unsatisfactory. I would not want to accept as a principle that there are cases where accommodation cannot be provided, in spite of the fact that it is easily available through some means external to the parties. Public Works can take some comfort in the fact that what can be reasonably expected of a third party may be less than what can be expected of the principal Respondent.\n[274] There are two possibilities here. One is that there is a general duty to facilitate accommodation. The failure to fulfill this duty is enough to substantiate a complaint against a third party. On this reading of the Canadian Human Rights Act, it is enough that Public Works refused to co-operate with the other parties in determining whether it was feasible to use the Connaught Building. The liability of Public Works may be limited to the failure to co-operate; but it is nonetheless liable.\n[275] There is no need to go this far in the present case, however. The other possibility is that there is enough of a nexus between Public Works and the NCC to impose a special duty on Public Works. I recognize that the two agencies, if I can use that term, are separate legal entities. They are nevertheless both emanations of the Crown and serve the public interest.\n[276] There is a doctrine of law that says the Crown is indivisible. I think the idea behind this doctrine is helpful, at least by analogy, in the circumstances of the present case. The decisive factor is that the Crown is in some sense the ultimate owner of both the York Street Steps and the Connaught Building. The stewardship of the two parcels of land may be under separate hands, but the property and object of ownership is in some sense the same.\n[277] The legal personalities of the NCC and Public Works Government Services derive in some sense from the same source. In all the circumstances of the case, I think the nexus between the NCC and the Department of Public Works is sufficient to require that the Department assist the NCC in its investigation of the Connaught Building as a possible location for an elevator. The choice between giving effect to the fundamental rights of the person or allowing them to be frustrated by the technical division of ownership.\n[278] It seems to me that the provision of access in the present case is an obligation that attaches, in some sense, to the property in question. The Crown is in some sense the ultimate owner of both the York Street Steps and the Connaught Building, and it is the stewardship of the two properties\u2014I must say, in the larger public interest\u2014that has been called into question in the present case. I believe this ownership can be inferred from the evidence, though the matter was not dealt with as extensively as it should have been in the hearing.\nB. It is too late to complain of a defect in the process [279] There is a further argument from Public Works that there is a failure of natural justice. This argument is based on the failure of the CHRC to provide proper particulars.\n[280] I do not see any prejudice here. The questions posed by counsel for the CHRC throughout the course of the hearing were simple and straight-forward. The allegation is that Public Works refused to participate in the efforts of the other parties to find a means of providing access at the steps. The facts are few, but that is because Public Works refused to participate in the inquiry under the Act.\n[281] The argument from Public Works comes too late. The matter should have been raised much earlier. I find that Public Works waived any right to object, in choosing not to raise the issue until the end of the process, when it is too late to rectify the deficiency. Any defect has, in any event, been cured by the exchange of ample submissions on all sides.\n[282] The one aspect of these submissions from Public Works that I would accept is that the CHRC has over-reached itself, in arguing that Public Works has discriminated against Mr. Brown by failing to provide access through the Connaught Building. This goes too far on the evidence, as well as the particulars, and it is premature to say whether Public Works has any obligation to provide the use of its premises for the purposes of access.\nC. The merits of the case against Public Works [283] I do not accept the submission of counsel that Public Works seriously considered the possibility of allowing public access through the Connaught Building. The blame for this lies squarely on Public Works. The letter from Mr. Charette, the property manager for the Building, essentially pre-empted any discussion of the issue.\n[284] Public Works led evidence at the hearing with respect to its security concerns. This was new, however, and was not available to the parties until Public Works was added as a party to the complaint. The Department has nevertheless taken a consistent position. To quote from its written submissions:\nThe principal concern that Public Works had in offering access through the Connaught Building was that security issues could not be adequately dealt with.\nThis was highlighted by the testimony of Ms. Matte.\n[285] The submissions go on to suggest that members of the public would have to pass through various security measures, including security screening, personal identification, passes and baggage checks. It would be a security risk to have employees from the Canada Revenue Agency in the same elevator as members of the public. There was also evidence with respect to some of the architectural and physical problems that stand in the way of using the Connaught Building.\n[286] These concerns must be weighed and evaluated, along with a host of other considerations, in deciding whether it would be appropriate to use the Connaught Building to provide access at the York Street Steps. The problem is that Public Works has treated these concerns as a legal bar to any discussion of the possibility of accommodation. I reject this position. The process of accommodation contemplated by the Canadian Human Rights Act and the caselaw cannot be circumvented so easily.\n[287] The Complainant and the CHRC are entitled to a finding of liability. There is a sense, at least, in which this finding is preliminary. As Mr. Lester and Ms. Kikuchi put it, in their submissions:\n... before the Connaught Building option could properly be considered a reasonable accommodation or an effective remedy, it is clear that a consultation process with the various stakeholders must be undertaken.\nThis requires further negotiations between the parties.\n[288] I am satisfied that Public Works and Government Services has a legal obligation under the Canadian Human Rights Act to participate in the efforts of the NCC to solve the larger problem. Although I am not taking any position on the question whether the Connaught Building should be used to provide access at the York Street Steps, it remains one of the possibilities. It should be openly and properly considered, without conditions. I will let the parties decide how far that consideration should go.\n[289] I will leave aside the question whether the NCC might itself be liable, in some sense, for its failure to pursue the matter further. I nevertheless do not see how, on the evidence before me, the NCC could fulfill its legal duty to investigate the possibility of accommodation without seriously inquiring into the possible use of the Connaught Building. It seems to me that both the NCC and the CHRC should have insisted, far more vigorously, that Public Works participate in the process of accommodation.\nVI. Issues On Remedy [290] The caselaw makes it clear that the Tribunal has the authority to supervise the remedial part of its hearings. This is a normal part of its process. I will accordingly retain jurisdiction to deal with any issues arising out of the present decision and the question of remedy.\n[291] As I understand it, Mr. Brown is seeking the following:\nan order that the NCC make the existing York Street Steps accessible; a written apology; compensation for hurt feelings; a barrier free design accessibility audit of all the property administered by the NCC; training for all of the personnel of the NCC working on accessibility issues.\n[292] The CHRC is seeking:\na letter of apology for Mr. Brown; damages for pain and suffering; damages for expenses incurred; an order that the site be made wheelchair accessible; an order that the NCC work with the CHRC in determining a policy on accessibility.\n[293] There are a number of issues here. The decision in Stevenson v. Canada (Canadian Security Intelligence Service), [2003] F.C.J. No. 491 holds that I cannot order an apology. As a general rule, I think the question of compensation for pain and suffering should be dealt with promptly. It is not clear to me whether the CHRC speaks for Mr. Brown on the matter of compensation and expenses.\n[294] The parties are directed to advise me in writing how they wish to proceed. The request for an order that the NCC make the York Street Steps accessible is premature.I think it is sufficient to prepare a formal order, as I have suggested, requiring that the NCC return to the process of consultation, identify the possible alternatives, and propose some form of reasonable accommodation. The other parties would have the right to return to the Tribunal for direction if they feel that the NCC has refused to consider reasonable alternatives.\n[295] There is a political side to these consultations. They should involve the public. One would think that the Municipal Advisory Committee, Mr. Brown, and the CHRC should all be full participants in the process. There are other parties, departments and individuals who might also be consulted, whether it is those persons responsible for security in the area, or the representatives of the American Embassy. It is ultimately for the NCC to decide who should be included in the process, subject to any objections from the other parties.\n[296] There is another point. It seems to me that the process of consultations can only go forward on the basis that some form of accommodation can be provided at the steps. The only issue is what form of accommodation is reasonable. If any of the parties have difficulty with this understanding of the situation, they should apply to the Tribunal for further directions.\n[297] The parties are obliged to act in good faith. They have a legal obligation to try and reach a consensus within a reasonable timeframe. If there are any questions as to the process that should be followed in resolving the matter, or the parties need direction on a specific issue, they can apply to the Tribunal for directions.\nVII. Summary Of Major Findings [298] The complexity of the case is such that it may be of assistance to summarize the principal findings and directions in this decision. They are as follows:\nThe complaint has been substantiated against the NCC.The York Street Steps are not accessible.This is a contravention of s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.It has not been established that making them accessible would impose an undue hardship on the NCC. Public Works Government Services Canada failed to co-operate in the process of accommodation. This is a discriminatory form of conduct. The complaint has accordingly been substantiated against Public Works. The nexus between the NCC and Public Works, both of which are emanations of the Crown, is sufficient to require the co-operation of Public Works. The construction of the elevator at the Daly site does not satisfy the Crown\u2019s obligation to accommodate Mr. Brown and other persons who cannot climb the stairs. The NCC is legally obliged to provide accommodation to the point of undue hardship in the immediate vicinity of the steps. This area includes the north end of the Connaught Building. The duty to accommodate includes an obligation to participate in a meaningful dialogue with the party that requires accommodation. There is a duty to make inquiries and consult with the other parties. The NCC had an obligation to investigate the possibility of using the Connaught Building. Public Works had an obligation to co-operate in the investigation. Both Respondents failed in their obligations. I am satisfied that Public Works is independently liable for its failure to co-operate with the other parties in making the Steps accessible after the complaint was filed. This takes me to the existing situation. The NCC is obliged to make the York Street Steps accessible, up to the point set out in the Act. In doing so, the NCC has an obligation to consult with Mr. Brown, the CHRC, and the disabled community generally. The process of consultation should be open and meaningful. Decisions should not be made until after the consultation takes place. Public Works is legally obliged to participate in the process of consultation. There is a duty on Mr. Brown and any other participants in the process of consultation to participate sincerely in the process, inform the Respondents of their concerns, and accept a reasonable offer of accommodation. The legal mandate of the NCC must be respected. All of the participants in the process of consultation must recognize the legitimate concerns of the NCC, with respect to the symbolic, aesthetic, historical, and financial implications of any accommodation. I do not believe the factors listed in s. 15(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act are exhaustive. The consultation that took place in 1994 and 1999 was selective and insufficient. It was not the kind of thorough, searching process required by the law. The most obvious example of this is the failure to seriously address the possibility of using the elevator shaft at the North end of the Connaught Building. There are other issues, however, that should be investigated, such as the precise location of any proposed elevator at the site of the steps. I am satisfied that the NCC sincerely believed that the provision of an elevator at the Daly site would provide reasonable accommodation. This may help to explain why the NCC did not engage in the kind of open, exploratory discussion that the law requires in 1994 and 1999. Mr. Brown, Mr. Warren and Mr. McMahon, all of whom are unable to climb the steps, found the attitude of the NCC patronizing. It would be premature to comment on the kind of accommodation that would be appropriate. The expertise that is needed in architecture, planning, access and security lies in the hands of the parties, who will have to return to their discussions and determine what form of accommodation is required. The parties are directed to include a schedule for consultations in the formal order. I want to be clear that the obligations on the Respondents are limited to the provision of reasonable accommodation. This is worth repeating. The standard is reasonableness. The reference to undue hardship in the Canadian Human Rights Act does not change this standard. It is clear at the same time that the NCC has no obligation to accommodate the Complainant and people with disabilities if the accommodation in question would impose an undue hardship on it. If the Complainant and Commission feel that the Respondents have not fulfilled their duty to consult openly and sincerely with the other parties, or acted unreasonably, they are entitled to return to the Tribunal. All of the parties are entitled to request the assistance of the Tribunal, if issues arise that require its direction. The parties are accordingly directed to return to their negotiations. Once these negotiations are completed, and the NCC has determined what accommodation it is willing to provide, it is directed to deliver a formal letter of intention or other notice of proposed action to the other parties, setting out its plans for rectifying the situation. This document shall be signed by the Chair of the NCC, the Chair\u2019s designate, or an officer of the agency, with the authority to bind the NCC. The other parties will have 30 days to bring the matter formally before the Tribunal, if they feel that this process will not resolve the complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act.All of the parties have the right to come back to the Tribunal at an earlier time, should that be necessary. The parties are directed to advise the Tribunal within the next 30 days as to how they would like to deal with the request for compensation and any other outstanding matters. There should be a written order, in the circumstances of the case. I would accordingly direct the CHRC to prepare a formal order, setting out the terms and conditions on which the matter will proceed. If the parties cannot agree on the terms of the order, I would direct them to contact the Tribunal within 45 days of the date of this decision.\n[299] This has been an arduous case and I would like to thank all counsel for their able assistance. I look forward to hearing from the parties.\n[300] I regret to say that Geoffrey Lester, lead counsel for Public Works, died unexpectedly before he was able to make his final submissions. I am sure that counsel and the parties would like me to recognize the work he did on the case. Mr. Lester was a passionate litigator and earned the respect of everyone in the hearing.I think his colleagues must miss his intensity, frankness and intellectual rigour.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario June 6, 2006\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T760\/1003\nStyle of Cause: Bob Brown v.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] Esper Powell, the complainant in this matter, filed a complaint dated January 16, 2002 alleging discrimination by the respondent, United Parcel Service Canada Ltd., contrary to ss. 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The complainant alleged occurrences of discrimination in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1996 and 2001.\n[2] The respondent, by motion dated January 3, 2005, (supporting affidavit dated March 31, 2006) requested in paragraph (a) of the motion, that the Tribunal order that the only allegation of discrimination referred to the Tribunal for inquiry in respect of the complaint relates to the alleged incident on July 20, 2001.\n[3] The Commission has prepared two Investigation Reports, dated May 21, 2003 and February 18, 2004. The May 21, 2003 Investigation Report concluded that the alleged incidents of discrimination in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1996 are out of time. The Report recommended that the Commission investigate only the July 20, 2001 allegation of discrimination.\n[4] The Commission did so and the February 18, 2004 Investigation Report is the product. The Report focused on the July 20, 2001 occurrence and recommended that failing conciliation, the complaint be referred to the Tribunal for inquiry. It was referred by the Commission to the Tribunal on August 19, 2004.\n[5] It is clear that the alleged incident of discrimination investigated by the Commission and referred to the Tribunal for an inquiry was that on July 20, 2001.\n[6] The complainant agrees with this. In his June 15, 2005 fax, complainant counsel, wrote: ...I've met with Ms. Powell in connection with your motion materials. She instructed me to agree that the only complaint referred to the Tribunal for determination is the one for July 20, 2001. However, she does not instruct me to agree that UPS not have to respond to the allegations prior to July 20, 2001.\n[7] This question was also considered in the January 15, 2005 teleconference, between the Tribunal and counsel for both parties. At that time, both counsel agreed to an Order confirming that the only complaint which has been referred to the Tribunal for inquiry and determination in respect of the Applicant, Esper Powell's Complaint, relates to the alleged incident on July 20, 2001, and not otherwise.\n[8] Turning to another matter, in complainant counsel's May 10, 2006 fax responding to the motion, counsel advised that the complainant has launched a new complaint against the respondent alleging further discrimination. Counsel requested that this complaint be dealt with together with the complainant's January 16, 2002 complaint.\n[9] The Tribunal can only inquire into complaints that have been referred to it by the Commission. The Commission has referred only the January 16, 2002 complaint to the Tribunal. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to join or hear any other complaint that may have been filed with the Commission.\nORDER\nThe Tribunal orders that the only allegation of discrimination in the January 16, 2002 complaint that has been referred to the Tribunal for inquiry is that relating to the alleged July 20, 2001 incident; The Tribunal further orders that each party provide, no later than June 30, 2006, dates in either November or December 2006 or January 2007 for the hearing of the complaint. It is expected the hearing will take a maximum of five days.\nSigned by\nJ.

The subpoena further required Mr. Lemire to produce all information within [his] possession relat[ing] to the use of the pseudonyms rump and realcanadianson on the Freedomsite message board. The information sought would include, but was not limited to, all the information identified by Mr. Lemire in paragraph 5 of an attached request by the Complainant for the issuance of a subpoena for Marc Lemire.\n[2] Ms. Kulaszka opposed the issuance of the subpoena on the grounds that it was unnecessary to the full hearing before the Tribunal, that Mr. Lemire had no material evidence to give to the Tribunal which was not already before it and that the subpoena was an abuse of process by the Complainant.\n[3] The Tribunal's authority to issue a subpoena is contained in section 53(3)a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act which provides:\n53 (3) In relation to a hearing of the inquiry, the member or panel may\n(a) in the same manner and to the same extent as a superior court of record, summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce any documents and things that the member or panel considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint\n[4] The issuance of a subpoena by this Tribunal is not an administrative act. The Tribunal has the discretion to issue or not a subpoena. Under section 50(3)(a) of the Act, a member or panel may issue a subpoena if the member or panel considers it necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint (CTEA v. Bell Canada, T503\/2098, ruling #2). The threshold to meet is not very heavy. First, there has to be a rational connection between the evidence that the potential witness is to give and the issues before the Tribunal. The request must not be speculative or amount to a fishing expedition. Finally, the request should not be oppressive.\n[5] After she took into consideration the request of the Complainant, the Tribunal member Karen Jensen, felt that the evidence of Mr. Lemire was necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint and she agreed to issue a subpoena. I see no reason to set this decision aside. I find in the present case that the proposed evidence to be given by Mr. Lemire, as submitted in the Complainant's request for a subpoena, is relevant to the issues in this hearing. The Complainant has established that there is a connection between the proposed evidence to be given by the witness and the issues in dispute.\n[6] Counsel for Mr. Lemire has not convinced me that the evidence of her client is unnecessary and she has also failed to convince me that the issuance of the subpoena was an abuse of process. The question of whether the evidence is relevant or material will be a question for me to decide.\n[7] Mr. Warman, during his reply to Ms. Kulaszka's motion, indicated that he would be satisfied if Mr. Lemire would agree to provide affidavit evidence. Ms. Susen Holmes, representative of the Respondent, did not object to this procedure. Although I am not ready to order that the evidence of Mr. Lemire be introduced by way of affidavit, I strongly urge the parties to consider this avenue. The Complainant and the Commission could forward to Ms. Kulaszka a series of questions by 4:00 p.m. Tuesday, June 13, 2006, and the answers could be provided by affidavit at the same time on Wednesday, June 14, 2006 and be introduced into evidence on the morning of Thursday, June 15, 2006.\n[8] At this time, the request of Ms. Kulaszka that the subpoena served on Mr. Marc Lemire be set aside is rejected. Mr. Lemire will be compelled to attend before the Tribunal at a date and time which will be indicated at the start of the hearing on Tuesday morning and notified to his solicitor, unless the parties are ready to agree on an alternate procedure.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario June 13, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1072\/5305\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRichard Warman v.

Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling on two motions. The first motion was brought by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to change the name of the Respondent from www.bcwhitepride.com to BC White Pride Group associated with website www.bcwhitepride.com, and to add two new Respondents, Mr. John Beck and White Renegade Group. The second motion is a request by Mr. Beck to dismiss the complaint against www.bcwhitepride.com without a hearing. Although Mr. Beck was not named as a respondent to the complaint, the Commission identified him as the appropriate individual to whom the Tribunal should send correspondence intended for the responding party.\n[2] In his motion, Mr. Beck argues that www.bcwhitepride.com is not a person or group of persons within the meaning of section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. He argues that the complaint therefore should be dismissed without a hearing. The complainant, Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations, did not make any submissions on the motions.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I have decided to adjourn the motions without prejudice to, or in any other way affecting the rights of the parties to bring these motions again at any time during the hearing.\n[4] Firstly, the fact that the Respondent's name includes .com does not, on its own, constitute grounds for an automatic dismissal of the complaint against that Respondent. Rather, the question is whether there is any evidence to indicate that www.bcwhitepride.com is the name of a person or group of persons acting in concert. In Warman v. Kulbashian 2006 CHRT 11, the Tribunal found, on the basis of the evidence presented during the hearing, that despite the presence of .com in its name, the respondent Affordable Space.com was a person within the meaning of s. 13(1) of the Act. There was evidence that Affordable Space.com was a firm that provided web services that enabled the impugned messages in that case to be disseminated over the Internet. In contrast, in that same case the Tribunal found no evidence to indicate that the named respondent www.tricityskins.com was anything more than the name of a website. As a result, the complaint against www.tricityskins.com was dismissed.\n[5] In the present case, there are conflicting facts and issues that require further inquiry before a determination can be made regarding the nature of the Respondent www.bcwhitepride.com. The Commission has filed the affidavit of Mr. Shane Martinez in support of its position on the motions. In his affidavit, Mr. Martinez deposes that, as part of his work in the area of human rights and social justice activism, he monitors the Internet. During the course of his monitoring activities, Mr. Martinez became aware of www.bcwhitepride.com and www.whiterenegade.com. Mr. Martinez deposed that he communicated directly with Mr. Beck regarding the websites. On the basis of those communications, Mr. Martinez asserts that BC White Pride is a group that was co-founded by Mr. John Beck and that Mr. Beck wrote much of the content of the group's website found at www.bcwhitepride.com.\n[6] On behalf of Mr. Beck, it is argued that Mr. Martinez's affidavit evidence is highly questionable and does not establish that there is a person or groups of persons acting in concert by the name of BC White Pride Group or www.bcwhitepride.com. Mr. Beck did not submit an affidavit and to date, there has been no cross-examination on the Martinez affidavit.\n[7] In my view, the evidentiary record before me at this time is insufficient to resolve the factual and legal issues that are necessary to determine whether the Respondent www.bcwhitepride.com is a person or group of persons acting in concert within the meaning of s. 13(1) of the Act.\n[8] The second reason to adjourn the present motions until the hearing relates to the Tribunal's concerns about dismissing a complaint without a hearing. Section 50(1) of the Act stipulates that after notice has been given to the appropriate parties, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties a full and ample opportunity to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. In fact, the Tribunal has dismissed complaints without a hearing in very few cases and then only on the basis of the doctrines of issue estoppel or abuse of process (Cremasco v. Canada Post Corporation 2002\/09\/30 - Ruling No. 1, aff'd 2004 FCA 363; Toth v. Kitchener Aero Avionics 2005 CHRT 19; O'Connor v. Canadian National Railway 2006 CHRT 05). In those cases, the Tribunal held that the issues raised in the complaint had been the subject of a final judicial determination in another forum. Therefore, it was determined that a full and ample opportunity had been provided to all concerned to raise the human rights issues in another forum. The Tribunal has stated that it is only in the clearest of cases that a complaint may be dismissed without a hearing on the basis of the doctrines of issue estoppel or abuse of process (Cremasco, supra, at para. 106).\n[9] Such is not the case in the present matter. There has been no prior determination of the issues raised in this case. In fact, the circumstances in this case are more akin to those in Bozek v. MCL Ryder [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 34, where the respondent sought to have the complaint dismissed without a hearing on the basis of delay and the prejudice arising from that delay. In that case, the Tribunal ruled that there were facts and issues in dispute that required that there be a full evidentiary record before a decision could be made as to whether the complaint should be dismissed on the basis of delay. Therefore, the Tribunal ruled that the motions would be adjourned until the hearing of the complaint.\n[10] Similarly, in the present case, there are facts and issues in dispute that require further inquiry. In response to Mr. Beck's assertion that there is no evidence to suggest that www.bcwhitepride.com is a person or group of persons acting in concert, the Commission argues that to dismiss the complaint without a hearing on the basis of the technical objection that the Respondent may not have been properly named would defeat the purpose of the Act. All that may be needed is to substitute the named Respondent www.bcwhitepride.com with BC White Pride Group associated with the website www.bcwhitepride.com. However, the question of whether the Tribunal has the authority to make such a substitution has not been argued. Moreover, the parties disagree as to whether an evidentiary basis exists for such a change to be made.\n[11] In the circumstances of the case, I do not see how this Tribunal can decide the Respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint at this time. Similarly, I do not see how the Tribunal can determine at this time, whether BC White Pride Group associated with the website www.bcwhitepride.com can be substituted for the currently named Respondent. The two issues are related and must, in my view, be determined on the basis of a proper evidentiary record.\n[12] With regard to the addition of the two other parties, White Renegade Group and John Beck, the Commission is free to raise this issue at the hearing if it so chooses.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

INTRODUCTION [1] On May 27, 2002, Mary Mellon (the Complainant) filed a complaint under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act) against Human Resources Development Canada (the Respondent). In her complaint she alleged that the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice on the ground of disability in a matter related to employment.\n[2] The Complainant alleges that she suffers from a disability; more specifically, she testified that she suffers from panic and anxiety attacks. She further asserts that a series of events related to these attacks occurred in the workplace between April 17 and August 30, 2001, creating conditions that led to the Respondent's decision not to renew her contract.\n[3] During the hearing, the parties requested that the issue of liability and the issues of damages and relief, if any, be dealt with separately. I agreed to the bifurcation of the hearing. Therefore, this decision will deal only with the issue of liability. Since I have found the complaint to be substantiated, another hearing will be ordered to deal with the issues of damages and relief.\nII. HISTORY OF THE COMPLAINANT'S EMPLOYMENT WITH THE RESPONDENT [4] The Complainant started working for the Respondent on November 25, 1991 as a term employee. She held the position of CR-03, Reception and Enquiries in the Respondent's Hamilton office. This employment was to end on December 31, 1991 but three term extensions were granted. It finally terminated on May 1, 1992.\n[5] She was given another term appointment on December 31, 1992, at the same position and classification. This term ended on March 31, 1993. A new term appointment, at the same position and classification, was made on December 2, 1993, with two more extensions, one on December 30, 1993, and another on March 1, 1994. This period of employment terminated on March 23, 1994.\n[6] The Complainant testified that she enjoyed her work in this position. She added that the workplace provided a happy and pleasant environment. A letter of recommendation, dated December 7, 1993, prepared by the Respondent's Supervisor of Employment Services, referred to the Complainant as an employee who diligently carr[ies] out her duties with efficiency and effectiveness and as a pleasant individual who is easy to work with.\n[7] On July 28, 1994, the Complainant was offered another term of employment, this time in the Respondent's Burlington Office. This was again a CR-03 position. Two other term extensions were offered to the Complainant in this position, one on October 6, 1994 and the other on December 29, 1994. The last term came to an end on March 22, 1995.\n[8] On February 24, 1995, her supervisor in the Burlington Office, Mr. Rick Levert, wrote that the Complainant has proven herself to be a most reliable and dependable worker. He further added that [s]he adapted well to the routine of our office and has become a valuable member of our staff in the short time she has worked here. Her pleasant manner and friendliness enabled her to quickly gain the respect of other staff members and her helpful and accommodating attitude towards working with others has been a positive influence for our office.\n[9] In the summer of 1997, the Complainant was contacted by Ms. Marg Garey, manager of the Respondent's Oakville office. They had previously met in 1991 when the Complainant was working in the Hamilton Office. Ms. Garey offered the Complainant term employment in the Oakville office. The Complainant accepted, and from July 7, 1997 up to September 25, 1997, she worked in a CR-04 position, as a Client Service Representative. The difference between a CR-03 and a CR-04 job classification is that a CR-04 job involves more decision-making and multi-tasking.\n[10] According to the Complainant, this position was very challenging. She added that although she enjoyed her work, at one point it became too much for her and it started to affect her health. On October 29, 1997, she saw Dr. Charanjeat Mander, who was filling in for her regular family doctor. Dr. Mander eventually became the Complainant's family doctor. Dr. Mander decided to put the Complainant off work for a period of three weeks. She also prescribed Paxil, an antidepressant. The Complainant was on sick leave from October 17 to November 14, 1997. The memo in her file indicated emotional stress related to work\/cannot cope, unable to work until further notice.\n[11] The Complainant testified that she had informed her manager of her medical condition. She referred to a telephone conversation they had around that period. Her understanding of this conversation was that Marg Garey understood what she was dealing with. She added that she had informed her manager that she was on antidepressants and that they were having a really bad effect on her. She said that she indicated that under these circumstances she could not return to the workplace. Marg Garey testified that she had no recollection of this conversation.\n[12] The Complainant returned to work on November 17, 1997. On February 2, 1998, Ms. Garey offered the Complainant a lower level deployment to a CR-03 (Program Support Clerk) position. The Complainant said that she accepted this lower level deployment because it provided a more stable environment.\n[13] The Complainant was again hired, on a term basis, at the Oakville office at a CR-03 level, as service delivery support clerk, on May 11, 2000. This CR-03 position is referred to as her substantive or home base position. This appointment was renewed without break in employment, on July 7 and September 22, 2000 and on March 30, 2001. As of July 9, 2001, she was still working under this term but acting in another position at the CR-4 level, as a service delivery assistant.\n[14] The workplace was described as being self-directed, meaning that employees were being asked to sort out any problems within their team. This also meant that when someone was absent in the unit, then the unit had to work together to cover that absence.\n[15] According to the organizational chart dated July 9, 2001, the Oakville office had seven service delivery assistants at the CR-04 level and thirteen and a half program officers. During the summer period the number of program officers was actually inflated by four because of the summer career placement program. These four additional officers were only temporary and would have been gone by the Fall.\nIII. THE EVENTS OF APRIL TO AUGUST 2001 [16] Ms. Debby McIntyre was appointed service delivery manager at the Oakville office on April 17, 2001, to replace Marg Garey. She then asked Rick Levert, the service delivery coordinator, to oversee both the Foreign Worker Unit and the Labour Market Information Unit in addition to the in-person services.\n[17] Mr. Levert described this period as a transition stage. He added that one of the proposed changes was to work the Complainant into becoming the service delivery support person for the Foreign Worker Unit. This was a change for both the Unit and the Complainant since the Unit had never had a dedicated support person until that time. Prior to that period, the Complainant and Diann Luksa were handling the support functions for the Unit. The decision to make these changes was taken by Debby McIntyre, Dal Swackhammer, the supervisor of the Program Unit and Mr. Levert. Mr. Levert did not recall having any special conversation with the Complainant about these changes.\n[18] Debby McIntyre kept notes of her various meetings with the Complainant and other employees. She stated that it was her practice to make notes of meetings with employees. She would write her notes immediately following these meetings. These notes were very helpful in reconstructing the events of that period as the recollection of the various witnesses had become, in many cases, blurred by the passing of time.\n[19] Prior to April 17, 2001, Ms. McIntyre admitted that she had no knowledge that the Complainant had had any problems performing her duties. She also admitted that the Complainant's work performance never came up in her discussions with Marg Garey when she took over her position in Oakville.\n[20] The Complainant first met with her new supervisor on June 21, 2001. According to Debby McIntyre's notes, this meeting was requested by the Complainant. Her notes further indicate that the Complainant told her during this meeting that she was experiencing a reoccurrence of a health issue in the area of her neck which was causing her stress and anxiety. The Complainant admitted that she had had a growth removed in the area of the neck in March 2000.\n[21] Debby McIntyre also noted that the Complainant told her that she had consulted her doctor but had not shared with her the full extent of her situation and concerns for fear the doctor would advise her to stop working. Ms. McIntyre added that the Complainant indicated that in the past she had not given her former manager, Marg Garey, all her medical notes, choosing instead to ignore the advice of her doctor to take sick leave during previous illnesses. The Complainant disagreed with this statement, saying that she had never ignored a medical certificate issued by her doctor. She added that it was true that she was hesitant about taking medication because of the bad reaction she had had in the past while on medication.\n[22] On June 25, 2001, Ms. McIntyre met with Monica Kington and Esther Davis, two officers in the Foreign Workers Unit. In her notes, she states that they came to her office to let her know that they had some concerns regarding the Complainant. She noted they had observed that although the Complainant was at her work station, her work was piling up and was not getting done.\n[23] On June 27, 2001, the Complainant was invited to a meeting with Monica Kington, Esther Davis and Pat Richard, all officers of the Foreign Workers Unit. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss how to deal with the extra workload in the unit which was created by the fact that Diann Luksa was on sick leave. Ms. Luksa was absent from work from June 18 to July 13, 2001. During the meeting the Complainant was asked if she would take on the extra work. She testified that she tried to discuss her health but that Monica Kington replied that they didn't need to hear that. Monica Kington testified that she had no recollection of this exchange. She added that she remembered that the Complainant was upset during this meeting and that she indicated that she wanted to speak with her supervisor. Pat Richard testified that the Complainant had indicated that she would not do the work. The Complainant said that at the end of the meeting she agreed to take on this extra work.\n[24] The Complainant stated that following this meeting, she felt that the perception of her co-workers was that she did not want to do her work. She felt that because of this, her relationship with them was falling apart.\n[25] Immediately following this meeting, the officers went to Ms. McIntyre to give her some feedback. Ms. McIntyre noted that they had concerns that the Complainant did not want to join or participate in the meeting and that she became agitated and upset. Ms. McIntyre was also informed that the Complainant had raised issues regarding her health during this meeting. During her cross-examination, Ms. Kington said that she had not given this information to Ms. McIntyre. Pat Richard did not recall any discussions regarding the Complainant's health during that meeting. Since Esther Davis did not testify, I either have to accept that she is the one that told Ms. McIntyre that this issue was discussed at the meeting or that both Ms. Kington and Ms. Richard do not have a proper recollection of what was said at that meeting. Ms. McIntyre certainly did not make this up and I conclude that the Complainant's health was raised at the meeting and afterwards discussed with Ms. McIntyre.\n[26] Ms. McIntyre added that the fact that someone ended up being upset was not helpful in finding a solution to how the work would get done. She further noted that the officers had indicated that the Complainant seemed to like doing the lower priority work, like mailing out kits and typing letters, instead of doing data input. At that point, she indicated that she was mainly preoccupied with understanding what was needed operationally to get the work done, but did not become directly involved.\n[27] Pat Richard also met with Rick Levert to inform him about what was discussed during this meeting. On cross-examination, Mr. Levert said that he was not aware that it was during this meeting that the Complainant was first informed that she was to assume all the duties of the Foreign Worker Unit. He added, that while he could not remember when, she must have been informed of these changes before that meeting, though probably not formally. However, he agreed that it was possible that this issue came up for the first time at that meeting.\n[28] The Complainant testified that the added workload started to have an effect on her health. By the end of June 2001, she said that she was experiencing anxiety attacks and was feeling very stressed. She added that she did not have the skills to do Ms. Luksa's job, although she did attempt to do it. She felt that she was letting down the officers of her unit because she was unable to complete all of her work. Up until then she had been responsible for the live-in caregiver applications which, in her words, were simpler to learn. She was now expected to do the industrial applications data entry for which she says she had no training except for maybe twenty minutes with Diann Luksa.\n[29] The Complainant described her anxiety attacks as causing difficult[y] to breathe and think clearly. She added that they would last from five to ten minutes and afterwards she would be fine. The Complainant said that on or about June 28, 2001, she had explained her situation to her supervisor, Rick Levert. Mr. Levert testified that during this meeting the Complainant was very emotional. She kept repeating that she felt that they were taking the jobs of two people and compressing them into one. He said that he tried to explain that the duties were reasonable for one person to perform. The issue of training was also discussed. He indicated that she did make reference to the fact that she could not let her health be negatively affected by her work. He also added that she had indicated that she was seeing her doctor and that after she had seen her she would get back to him.\n[30] On June 28, 2001, the officers met again with Ms. McIntyre. Ms. McIntyre's notes indicate that there was then a real concern in the unit. The officers told her that the Complainant had gone home sick without telling them, which, according to Ms. McIntyre, would be the normal practice. She added that at that time she was looking at this whole issue of controllables and knowing that Mary was perhaps dealing with a previous health condition, a recurrence of this neck situation... and I didn't know what that was. You know, my mind was taking me to tumours and things like that? She further added I looked at what Mary's job was in the Foreign Workers Unit and I looked at what the jobs were in talking with the other supervisors and the other clerk... I was trying to do an analysis of what is the best clerical job in the office in terms of controllables, in terms of flexibility, stress level. It is clear that by this time Ms. McIntyre knew that there was a health issue, although she did not know the extent, and that this health issue was having an impact on the Complainant.\n[31] The Complainant left a voice mail with Ms. McIntyre on June 29, informing her that she would not be at work since she was not doing well. She also mentioned that she needed to resolve some issues before returning to work. On that same day, she saw Doctor Huschilt, who at that time was covering for Doctor Mander. She was then complaining of neck pains and stress at work. Doctor Huschilt decided to send her for x -rays of her neck. He also prescribed Flexeril, a muscle relaxant, and Tylenol, an analgesic.\n[32] Rick Levert also received a voice mail from the Complainant on June 29, 2001. She informed him that her doctor had put her off work indefinitely and that she would keep him up to date. He also received a medical note dated June 29, 2001 from Dr. Mander indicating that she was under medical care and unable to work.\n[33] The Complainant was absent from work from June 30, 2001 to July 23, 2001. A medical note dated July 19, 2001 indicated work stress. The Complainant added that she had given this medical note to her employer.\n[34] Rick Levert contacted the Complainant on July 3, to inquire about the length of her absence. On July 9, the Complainant left a voice mail for Rick Levert in which she indicated that she hadn't received the test result from her doctor. She also added that it might be possible for her to come back to work soon but before she returns however, if she does return back, she does need to clarify a few things. On cross-examination, the Complainant explained that what she was referring to in this voice mail was the problem she was experiencing with the workload and the stress this was causing her.\n[35] On her return to work on July 23, 2001, she said she felt that nothing had changed. According to the Complainant, the attitude of management was that her position could be done by one person. The Complainant testified that during this period she was trying desperately to hold on to her job. She added that she felt really bad because the relationship that she had with her co-workers in the unit had disappeared.\n[36] She said that she met Rick Levert on July 25, 2001. The Complainant added that she got the feeling from this meeting that there would not be any help with her workload. The message she was getting was that her job was doable by one person.\n[37] Rick Levert took notes of this meeting. This was the first time that he took notes of a meeting with the Complainant. He said that he felt that the situation was getting complicated and that after discussing the matter with Debby McIntyre they had decided that it would be a good idea to take notes of these meetings. During this meeting he noticed that the Complainant was not as emotional as the previous meeting. He added that she seemed more determined. She informed him that her health was not good and that this was a permanent condition. She felt that her illness was work-related. Mr. Levert remembers telling her that the duties associated with her job were reasonable. He also remembers discussing with her the question of her reverting back to her CR-03 job. He advised her that in the new organization of the office, that job was no longer required. The Complainant was very definite that she could not handle the job and that she had decisions to make. Mr. Levert did not ask her to elaborate on her medical condition.\n[38] The Complainant wrote a note to Rick Levert and to Debby McIntyre on July 26, 2001. She was requesting clarification regarding her duties and responsibilities. She also mentioned that she wanted this issue solved as the health problem due to the stress\/workload in the past is now returning and [the] extra workload has contributed to this problem.\n[39] On that same day, Rick Levert met with Monica Kington, Esther Davis and Pat Richard to discuss the operational working of the Unit. Mr. Levert made some notes of this meeting. Most of these notes refer to the performance of the Complainant in the Unit and are observations made by her co-workers.\n[40] Debby McIntyre was away on vacation from July 23 to August 7, 2001. On her return, the Complainant was starting her two weeks' vacation, so, as Ms. McIntyre stated, they were like two ships passing in the night.\n[41] On August 8, 2001, Ms. McIntyre prepared another note which reflects a visit to her office by Esther Davis. Ms. Davis related to her that since the Complainant's return to work from her sick leave, she had observed that she had resumed her duties to a degree and that she was working at about 50% of her normal productivity level. Ms. Davis, according to the note, also referred to a meeting between the Complainant and Rick Levert on July 25 where she observed that the Complainant burst into tears. Rick Levert testified that this did not happen during the July 25 meeting, but at the previous meeting, on June 28, 2001.\n[42] On August 9, 2001, Ms. McIntyre wrote a memo to the Complainant answering the Complainant's note of July 26, 2001. She informed the Complainant that Rick Levert had reviewed her job duties, in consultation with other staff members, and had come to the conclusion that the job was reasonable for one person. She further added: I share your concerns regarding your health, and want to discuss your concerns.\n[43] The Complainant returned from her vacation on August 20, 2001, and on that day she met with her manager. At this meeting, Debby McIntyre presented to the Complainant a copy of the memo she had prepared on August 9, 2001. The Complainant testified that her manager looked irritated and seemed frustrated that she was still requesting help. The Complainant recalls having discussed her health condition with her manager during this meeting but stated that she received no suggestions from her on how to approach this problem. She said that she had taken that extra step to explain to her manager that she was suffering from anxiety attacks and stress. The Complainant testified that she left this meeting feeling very upset and convinced that her job in the Oakville office was gone.\n[44] According to Debby McIntyre's notes, the Complainant indicated that while she felt that she was capable of doing the whole job, she still felt that her health was an issue. She added that the Complainant mentioned that she would do her best and see how her health would hold out. The Complainant told her that she was suffering from increased anxiety attacks which were triggered by job-related stress. According to Ms. McIntyre, this was the first time that the Complainant had mentioned this to her.\n[45] Esther Davis and Monica Kington approached Debby McIntyre on August 21, 2001, regarding the Complainant. Again according to Ms. McIntyre's notes, they were observing that although the Complainant appeared very busy her work was lagging behind. They indicated that they were having difficulties with her ability to set priorities and to perform her duties.\n[46] On August 23, 2001, the Complainant went back to see her manager to bring her the statistics she had compiled regarding the phone calls she had to deal with in the Foreign Workers Unit. According to the Complainant, her manager told her that she was too busy to deal with them and told her to bring this matter up with Rick Levert. In her evidence, Debby McIntyre does not disagree with this. In her note, she indicates that the Complainant was teary during this meeting. She added that she inquired how she was doing and the Complainant answered that she was not doing very well and that she had to make some decisions about her job and her health. Ms. McIntyre added that she did encourage the Complainant to see her doctor and to take time off if that is what she needed.\n[47] August 30, 2001 was the Complainant's last day at work. The Complainant recalls that the files kept piling up and that she was getting sicker and sicker. She also recalls that Pat Richard was getting upset that she wasn't getting through the files. She testified that on that day she had a lot of Foreign Recruitment files for the industrial applications which needed attention. She remembers sending an e-mail to Debby McIntyre at 8:05 a.m., requesting help with these files because there was a deadline and they needed to be dealt with.\n[48] In her written notes of that day, Ms. McIntyre indicates that she went over to the Complainant's work station after she received the e-mail. The Complainant mentioned that she was still having problems with some of the filing. Ms. McIntyre then indicated that Pat Richard was busy and that she would ask Diann Luksa to help her. Around 10:45 a.m., she noted that Glen Harris, a co-worker of the Complainant, told her that the Complainant was in the lunch room crying. She added that she went over to get the Complainant and offered her office to help her compose herself before she was driven home. The Complainant said to her that she was having an anxiety attack. After she had calmed down, she added that the CR-04 job was just too much for her. She also indicated that her health was being affected and that she could not continue working.\n[49] The Complainant testified that during this attack, she was having difficulty breathing and that she felt as if she was going to pass out. She added that she was shaking, that she was emotionally upset and that she could not think clearly. She further added that this was not the first time that she had experienced a panic attack during that summer. These attacks would last for about ten minutes and afterward she would feel unwell.\n[50] In her evidence, Ms. McIntyre stated that she asked the Complainant whether she had seen her doctor recently and the Complainant indicated that she had the day before and that the doctor wanted her to take some medication. Ms. McIntyre testified that she encouraged the Complainant to see her doctor again as soon as she could and to seriously reconsider the medication.\n[51] Ms. McIntyre indicated in her notes of August 30, 2001 that she had told the Complainant that she felt that, for her own well-being as well as the functioning of the unit, she could not offer her the CR-04 job after September 30, 2001. During her examination, she added that she didn't want the Complainant leaving that day thinking that she had to come back to that job. Ms. McIntyre also stated that she informed the Complainant that there were no CR-03 jobs available for her in the Oakville and Burlington offices. She offered to approach the corporate services manager of the Respondent in Mississauga East to see if there might be CR-03 opportunities elsewhere.\n[52] On September 28, 2001, the Complainant received a letter from Debby McIntyre informing her that her current term CR-03 contract was extended for one month as an interim staffing measure, in order to make you aware of other CR-03 vacancies in Peel-Halton-Dufferin, and market you accordingly, if you wish.\n[53] On October 10, 2001, Debby McIntyre had a telephone conversation with the Complainant at which time she told her that there was possibly a CR-03 position in the Mississauga West office of the Respondent. The Complainant said that she would be happy to meet with Vicky Shea, the manager of that office, to discuss this possibility but she never heard from Ms. Shea.\n[54] On October 22, 2001, the Complainant wrote a letter to Ms. McIntyre in which she referred to her employer's obligation to accommodate her. She was requesting to be kept on leave without pay until she was well enough to return to work.\n[55] She received an answer to this letter on October 29, 2001. Her manager stated, amongst other things, [t]he Duty to Accommodate pertains to technical aids in the context of workplace accommodation for persons with disabilities - and I believe there is some confusion in your suggestion that accommodation includes contract extensions, in a location where there is no job.\n[56] On May 27, 2002, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\nIV. THE EVIDENCE OF DOCTOR CHARANJEAT MANDER [57] The only medical evidence presented by either party was that of Dr. Charanjeat Mander, the Complainant's family doctor.\n[58] Dr. Mander studied medicine at the Christian Medical College, in the City of Ludhiana, Punjab, India, where she obtained her medical degree in 1965. After her graduation, she moved to Glasgow, Scotland, with her husband, where she did one year of residency in psychiatry. In 1974, the family moved to Canada where she did her internship in internal medicine at St. Joseph Hospital (now the Queensway Health Centre) in Toronto. In 1979, after having successfully passed her licensing exam, she started her medical practice, in Burlington, where she has been practicing as a general practitioner ever since.\n[59] Dr. Mander was qualified as an expert in general family clinical practice and was allowed to give opinion evidence as the treating physician of the Complainant.\n[60] According to Dr. Mander, anxiety is a very common complaint in a practice such as hers. She added that because of the shortage of psychiatrists, general practitioners play an important role in treating people with anxiety. The most common symptoms of anxiety are nervousness, palpitations and lack of sleep. Normally, when a patient comes forward with these symptoms, the doctor must listen to them carefully and identify the reasons for the anxiety. In such cases the patient's history is the most important thing.\n[61] Dr. Mander indicated that she would, in these cases, recommend first rest or a few days off work. The second step in the treatment would be to prescribe a mild tranquillizer, for example Ativan. She said that she would usually prescribe, at this stage, five milligrams sublingual to see how the patient responds. If this does not work she would consider moving up to a stronger tranquillizer. The third step would be to refer the patient to a specialist.\n[62] Dr. Mander testified that she first saw the Complainant, as her family doctor, on October 5, 1999, although she had seen her on October 29, 1997, when she was replacing the Complainant's previous family doctor.\n[63] Dr. Mander's clinical notes indicate that the Complainant was seen on June 26, 2001, by Dr. Huschilt, who at the time was covering her practice. In her notes she indicates that Dr. Huschilt mentioned that during this visit the Complainant complained of neck pain and stress at work. The Complainant again saw Dr. Huschilt on June 29, 2001, complaining of stress at work. Dr. Huschilt's diagnosis was anxiety and he prescribed time off-work.\n[64] Dr. Mander saw the Complainant on July 19, 2001. She noted stress at work - too much work. Neck pains. Needs some changes at work. Doing work as two people. Emotional stress. Extremely distraught. At that time the Complainant had been off work since June 29, 2001. The Complainant told Dr. Mander that she wanted to return to work but with some changes in the workplace.\n[65] The doctor saw the Complainant again on August 3, 2001. Although there is no reference to this in her notes, Dr. Mander testified that the Complainant was still tense. She informed her doctor that she had written to her manager about her work-related problems, but that the manager at that time was on holidays. She told Dr. Mander that she was going to take 10 days of vacation which should help her get a little bit more settled.\n[66] The Complainant's next appointment was on August 28, 2001. She had just returned to work. In her notes Dr. Mander wrote: Anxiety attacks, palpitations, nervous, shortness of breath once or twice a week [...] typical anxiety. At the hearing, Dr. Mander added that during this visit the Complainant was crying, was very nervous and had shaky hands. The Complainant told her that she was very nervous and had difficulty sleeping. Dr. Mander prescribed Ativan, a tranquillizer, at 0.5 milligrams, sublingual, to be used as required. She also noted that the Complainant was quite upset about her workload.\n[67] Dr. Mander saw the Complainant again on August 31, 2001. She noted that the Complainant told her that she could not handle her job; that it was too much pressure. She also noted that the Complainant was crying and that she was very upset. The Complainant told Dr. Mander that she did not want to go back to her job under the present circumstances. She wanted management to take away the extra duties which she claims had been given to her. Dr. Mander noted that panic attacks are starting from pressure. She gave the Complainant a note which indicated that she was to stay off work for [an] indefinite period. Extreme stress at job situation. Too much work was loaded on her.\n[68] The Complainant returned to see her doctor on September 4, 2001. Dr. Mander noted that she was feeling better because she was off work. The Complainant told her doctor that she was sleeping better and had no more panic feelings. Dr. Mander added that the Complainant was not on antidepressants at this time because she was not depressed.\n[69] On September 10, 2001, Dr. Mander made arrangements to refer the Complainant to a specialist, Dr. V. M. Celine Kumiranayake, a clinical psychiatrist in Burlington. According to Dr. Mander, the Complainant saw Dr. Kumiranayake on September 18, 2001. Dr. Kumiranayake, who is now retired, was not called as a witness. She sent a report of her evaluation of the Complainant to Dr. Mander which she received on September 20, 2001. After this meeting, Dr. Kumiranayake did not see the Complainant again.\n[70] According to Dr. Mander, Dr. Kumiranayake's diagnosis of the Complainant was acute panic attack secondary to work related stress. In her report, Dr. Kumiranayake wrote [t]his lady seems to have had an Acute Panic Attack secondary to Work Related Stress. (Emphasis added)\n[71] The next notation by Dr. Mander is for September 25, 2001. The doctor noted that the Complainant was feeling happier, had a positive attitude and no panic. The Complainant told her doctor that she didn't want to take any medication as she was now feeling better.\n[72] On October 18, 2001, the Complainant again saw Dr. Mander. According to the doctor's notes, she was beginning to feel stress due to some problems with [the] employer...regarding disabilities. Dr. Mander did not make any physical observations of the Complainant.\n[73] The next appointment was on November 9, 2001. The doctor noted that the Complainant was tired, depressed, anxious, very, very tense. She decided to prescribe Paxil, an antidepressant, because she felt that the Complainant was not improving despite being off the job. On cross-examination, she added that the Complainant told her afterwards that she never took the antidepressant.\n[74] On December 14, 2001, Dr. Mander saw the Complainant. The Complainant seemed to be doing better and she verbalized her intention to go back to work. Dr. Mander gave the Complainant a Doctor's Note indicating that she was ready to return to work full time.\n[75] During her cross-examination, Dr. Mander admitted that she personally didn't have any idea of what was going on in the Complainant's workplace and that for this information she relied solely on the Complainant. She further added that her role was to observe the patient and not to get involved in what she described as the legal hassles between the workplace and the patient. She also indicated that the Complainant was suffering from reactive depression to her workplace which does not mean that the Complainant was suffering from clinical depression.\nV. LEGISLATION For the purpose of this case the relevant sections of the Act are:\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n15. (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\n(2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\n25. In this Act\ndisability means any previous or existing mental or physical disability and includes disfigurement and previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug.\nVI. THE ISSUES The issues in this proceeding are the following:\nHas the Complainant established a prima facie case of discrimination? If a prima facie case is established, did the Respondent fail to accommodate the Complainant?\nVII. LEGAL ANALYSIS [76] In the Supreme Court's decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 [also referred to as Meiorin] and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 [also referred to as Grismer], the Court indicated that the initial onus is on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent.[ See Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Limited, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at p. 558.]\n[77] In Canadian Human Right Commission v. Attorney General of Canada, (Morris) 2005 FCA 154, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the legal definition of a prima facie case does not require the Complainant to adduce any particular type of evidence to prove that she was a victim of a discriminatory practice. A flexible test is more appropriate.\n[78] Section 3 of the Act declares that disability is a prohibited ground of discrimination. Disability is defined at section 25 as a previous or existing ... mental disability.\n[79] A key issue in this case is whether or not the Complainant has a disability. In Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montr\u00e9al City and Boisbriand (City), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665 [also referred to as Mercier], the Supreme Court of Canada made some important comments about the ways in which courts need to think about and view disabilities. The Court sets out a broad legal test for how one establishes whether or not there is a disability within the meaning of human rights legislation.\n[80] Although the Mercier decision arose out of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and not the Act, the comments of the Court are just as applicable to the latter since both provide similar protections. The Court focused its attention on the meaning and scope of the term handicap, which is the term used in the Quebec Charter to refer to a disability. More specifically the Court had this to say:\n75 The following definition of the term handicap appears in the International Classification of Impairments:\nIn the context of health experience, a handicap is a disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability, that limits or prevents the fulfilment of a role that is normal (depending on age, sex, and social and cultural factors) for that individual.\n76 I completely agree with Philippon J. that the ground handicap must not be confined within a narrow definition that leaves no room for flexibility. Instead of creating an exhaustive definition of this concept, it seems more appropriate to propose a series of guidelines that will facilitate interpretation and, at the same time, allow courts to develop the notion of handicap consistently with various biomedical, social or technological factors. Given both the rapid advances in biomedical technology, and more specifically in genetics, as well as the fact that what is a handicap today may or may not be one tomorrow, an overly narrow definition would not necessarily serve the purpose of the Charter in this regard.\n77 Generally, these guidelines should be consistent with the socio-political model proposed by J. E. Bickenbach in Physical Disability and Social Policy (1993). This is not to say that the biomedical basis of handicap should be ignored, but rather to point out that, for the purposes of the Charter, we must go beyond this single criterion. Instead, a multi-dimensional approach that includes a socio-political dimension is particularly appropriate. By placing the emphasis on human dignity, respect, and the right to equality rather than a simple biomedical condition, this approach recognizes that the attitudes of society and its members often contribute to the idea or perception of a handicap. In fact, a person may have no limitations in everyday activities other than those created by prejudice and stereotypes.\n78 In Legal Rights for Persons with Disabilities in Canada: Can the Impasse Be Resolved? (1997-98), 29 Ottawa L. Rev. 153, I. B. McKenna described the scope of the word handicap as follows, at p. 164:\nIt is the combined effect of an individual's impairment or disability and the environment constructed by society that determines whether such an individual experiences a handicap.\nSimilarly, Professor Proulx, supra, at p. 416, states:\n[TRANSLATION] . . . what matters with respect to discrimination based on handicap is not so much whether the victim of the exclusion has a real handicap or is actually a handicapped person within the meaning of other legislation enacted for other purposes or even within the ordinary meaning of these terms.. Central to the analysis is not so much the concept of the handicap itself, but the discrimination based on the handicap.\nSee also Lepofsky and Bickenbach, supra, at p. 343.\n79. Thus, a handicap may be the result of a physical limitation, an ailment, a social construct, a perceived limitation or a combination of all of these factors. Indeed, it is the combined effect of all these circumstances that determines whether the individual has a handicap for the purposes of the Charter.\n[81] Therefore in order to determine whether a person suffers from a disability the Tribunal will have to consider not only the medical condition of the Complainant, but also the circumstances in which a distinction is made. The Court adds: In examining the context in which the impugned act occurred, the court must determine, inter alia, whether an actual or perceived ailment causes the individual to experience the loss or limitation of opportunities to take part in the life of the community in an equal level with others.. (Para. 80.)\n[82] A disability may exist even without proof of physical limitations or the presence of an ailment. Although the Supreme Court is reminding us that an overreliance on medical information is not necessary in order to establish that a disability does or does not exist, there needs to be more that just a bare statement that one suffers from a disability to meet the test. There has to be evidence that the disability is there. This evidence can be drawn from the medical information and from the context in which the impugned act occurred.\n[83] In a recent decision, Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal had decided that there was a prima facie case of discrimination on the ground of disability by relying heavily on the evidence of the Complainant and her family doctor. On review, the Federal Court found that the Tribunal's finding on disability was unreasonable, mainly on the ground that the medical evidence in support of the finding was that of an expert in family medicine and that it was unreasonable to find that this doctor's evidence should carry more weight than the opinion of a specialized physician. The Federal Court judge concluded that there was no prima facie case to answer as she was not satisfied that there was properly admissible evidence to support a finding of disability.\n[84] The Federal Court of Appeal [2005 FCA 311] decided that the reviewing judge's decision was incorrect. It concluded that the Tribunal's decision on the issue of whether or not there was a disability was clearly one that deserved considerable deference. As the Supreme Court established in Granovsky v. Canada, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 703, at para. 34, and in Mercier, supra, at para. 71, disability in a legal sense consists of a physical or mental impairment, which results in a functional limitation or is associated with a perception of impairment. In light of this test, the Court of Appeal concluded that there was evidence before the Tribunal upon which it could reasonably find that there was a disability.\n[85] In the present case, as in the Desormeaux case, the Respondent argued that the medical evidence was not conclusive. Although it might be possible to qualify the medical evidence as not completely convincing, combined with the Complainant's and the Respondent's evidence, it is consistent with a finding that there is a disability.\n[86] The Respondent also relied, in its oral arguments, on a decision I rendered in Beauregard v. Canada Post Corp, [2004] C.H.R.D. N\u00b0 1 (upheld, 2005 CF 1384). It is important to note that the factual situation in the Beauregard case was somewhat different than in the present case. In Beauregard, the medical evidence on which the complainant relied had been contradicted by the respondent's own psychiatric and expert evidence. Furthermore, in that case there were no `at work' incidents clearly indicating that the complainant was experiencing medical issues.\n[87] Regarding panic attacks, the British Columbia Council of Human Rights, in Sansome v. Dodd (c.o.b Portside Paul's Fish & Chips), [1991] B.C.C.H.R.D. No. 17, determined that they constituted a disability for the purposes of the B.C. Human Rights Code. (See also Cameron v. Fletcher Challenge Canada Limited (1995), 24 C.H.R.R. D.\/506 (B.C.C.H.R.))\n[88] The Act does not contain a list of acceptable and unacceptable mental disabilities. It is not just the most serious or most severe mental disabilities that are entitled to the protection of the Act. Additionally, it is not solely those that constitute a permanent impairment that must be considered. Where appropriate, even mental disabilities described as minor with no permanent manifestation could be entitled to protection under the Act. However, sufficient evidence still needs to be presented to support the existence of the disability.\n[89] For the purposes of the prima facie test, I find that there is clear evidence that the Complainant was suffering from a disability, namely, panic attacks. I also find that her manager at the time, Ms. McIntyre, should have been able to conclude from her conversations with the Complainant and her observations that health-wise things were not going normally.\n[90] During the meeting of June 21, 2001, the Complainant told Ms. McIntyre that she was experiencing a reoccurrence of a health issue. Ms. McIntyre also knew that the Complainant had consulted her doctor. She was further informed on June 27, 2001, that during a meeting with her co-workers, the Complainant had raised issues regarding her health. She was also told that the Complainant was very upset during this meeting.\n[91] On June 28, 2001, the Complainant explained her situation to her supervisor Rick Levert. He testified that during this meeting the Complainant was very emotional. He added that at one point she burst into tears. The Complainant also informed her supervisor that she was seeing her doctor. On that same day, Ms. McIntyre was informed by the Complainant's co-workers that she had gone home sick. Ms. McIntyre also knew that Mary was dealing with a previous health condition.\n[92] Rick Levert was informed on June 29, 2001 that the Complainant's doctor had put her off work indefinitely. Actually, the Complainant was absent from work from June 30, 2001 to July 23, 2001, and the medical support documentation tendered to the employer indicated work stress. Just after her return to work, on July 25, 2005, the Complainant met with her supervisor and informed him that her health was not good and that this was a permanent condition.\n[93] In a letter written to Debby McIntyre and Rick Levert on July 26, 2001, the Complainant mentioned that her health problem due to the stress\/workload was returning. In her reply to this letter, on August 9, 2001, Debby McIntyre stated I share your concerns regarding your health.\n[94] On August 20, 2001, in a meeting with Debby McIntyre, the Complainant indicated that she still felt that her health was an issue. She mentioned that she was suffering from increased anxiety attacks which were triggered by her job. During another meeting on August 23, 2001, Debby McIntyre noted that the Complainant was teary. Ms. McIntyre inquired about the Complainant's health and she told her that she was not doing very well and that she had to make some decisions about her job. Ms. McIntyre encouraged her to see her doctor and to take time off if needed.\n[95] Then there were the events of August 30, 2001, which made it clear that the complainant was dealing with a medical situation.\n[96] Ms. McIntyre testified that she did not have the impression that the anxiety attacks referred to by the Complainant were an illness. Rather, she stated that her understanding was that the Complainant's stress and anxiety came from the fact that she was struggling with doing the duties of a CR-04. I understand this as being an acknowledgement on her part that she knew the Complainant was experiencing stress and anxiety but that she had made up her mind that these were performance issues.\n[97] All of the events described above should have sent up a red flag. I conclude that, from all of these events, the Respondent knew, or ought to have known that the Complainant was experiencing anxiety from work-related stress. The fact that she did not tell them in so many words does not disentitle her from the protection of the Act (see: Mager c. Louisiana-Pacific Canada Ltd., [1998] B.C.H.R.T.D. No. 36.) For its part, if the respondent felt that work induced stress is not a disability it should have sought a professional assessment of the Complainant.\n[98] It is not enough for the Respondent to say that they were not advised of or aware of the Complainant's condition. Certainly, from the evidence presented at the hearing, it is clear that they must have been aware that she was suffering from what might be described as a delicate emotional state. Knowing what it did, it was up to the employer to determine whether the complainant's health was affecting her performance. It had the responsibility to at least inquire as to whether the complainant's condition might impact upon its decision to terminate the Complainant.\n[99] Even if the Complainant did not present the employer with a medical diagnosis of her disability, this does not disentitle her to the protection of the Act. An individual with a disability and, in particular, somebody with a mental disability may not know the exact nature and extent of that disability at the time they are experiencing the symptoms. In such circumstances, we cannot impose a duty to disclose a conclusive medical diagnosis.\n[100] I do not minimize the importance for an employee to submit to the employer medical notes informing the employer of his or her medical situation. Employers rely on these notes to inform themselves of the employee's health condition insofar as this is relevant to the need for accommodation. I suspect, though, that most employees would be reluctant to inform the employer that they may have a mental disability. They may fear that an employer may use this information to their detriment and that it is in their best interest to work with their problems as best they can.\n[101] The obvious change in the Complainant's behaviour during the summer months of 2001 should have made the employer realize that there was something wrong. The Complainant had alerted her manager and supervisor during this period that the fact her work was not getting done was not because she was not interested in doing it, but because she had a health issue. Her employer, for its part, had decided, based on information that it was getting from her co-workers, that this was a performance issue and not a question of disability.\n[102] Ms. McIntyre was convinced that the Complainant was not able to do the CR-04 job. She truly believed that the Complainant felt that the job wasn't doable and that she had shut her mind to ways in which she could make it doable. Ms. McIntyre felt that the manager had a responsibility to ensure stability in the unit to support the officers. She added that the Complainant had a history. By this she meant that she had determined that the Complainant had a pattern of absence where she would work for a period of time and then go off on leave. This conclusion is interesting in view of the fact that it did not come up during the time that Marg Garey was the Complainant's manager and no mention of this history was made to Ms. McIntyre when she took over the position of manager. The evidence does not support this conclusion.\n[103] The Respondent should have explored why the work was piling up; why the employee's performance was going down. Based on the evidence before it, the Respondent could not simply jump to the conclusion that this performance problem was stemming from a poor attitude.\n[104] In this particular case, it is clear that the ultimate decision not to renew the Complainant's contract was influenced by her disability. In this regard, one has only to look at Ms. McIntyre's notes on August 30, 2001, which reflect a conversation that she had with a representative of staffing relations at the Respondent's regional headquarters, and in which she mentions that to renew Mary's contract of 30 Sept\/01 in my opinion is not wise for Mary's continued good health. (Emphasis added) This, by itself, is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The Complainant's health or disability was manifestly present in the Respondent's mind when it decided not to continue to employ her.\n[105] Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the onus shifts to the Respondent to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the seemingly discriminatory standard or policy that it applied is a bona fide occupational requirement. In order to establish this, according to Meiorin and Grismer the Respondent must prove that:\nit adopted the standard for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the function being performed; it adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose, with no intention of discriminating against the claimant; the impugned standard is reasonably necessary for the employer to accomplish its purpose. The employer must establish that it cannot accommodate the claimant and others adversely affected by the standard without experiencing undue hardship.\n[106] In the present case the standard or policy applied by the Respondent would be the decision to abolish the CR-03 position which the Complainant held and not to renew her term contract.\n[107] The Meiorin and Grismer decisions address parameters for determining whether a defence based on undue hardship has been established. In Meiorin, the Court observed that the use of the word undue implies that some hardship is acceptable. It is only undue hardship that satisfies this test. An uncompromisingly stringent standard may be ideal from an employer's perspective. Yet, if it is to be justified under human rights legislation, the standard must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship.\n[108] The Supreme Court observed that in order to meet this onus, the Respondent bears the burden of demonstrating that the standard incorporates every possible accommodation to the point of undue hardship. [See Grismer, supra, para. 32.] It is incumbent on the Respondent to show that it has considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation. The onus is on the Respondent to prove that incorporating aspects of individual accommodation within the standard was impossible short of undue hardship. [See Grismer, supra, para. 4.]\n[109] In Gardiner v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [2003] B.C.H.R.T.D. No. 40, the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal had this to say regarding the duty to accommodate (paras. 168 and 169):\nIt is important to make the distinction between the fact of a disability and the functional impact of the disability at any given period. An individual may have a continuing illness or injury which is found to be a disability under the Code, yet suffer no functional impact for long periods of time as a result of the disability: Morris v. B.C. Rail 2003 BCHRT 14. In such circumstances, if the fact of the disability is not brought to the attention of the Respondent, and accommodation is not requested, the Respondent may very well not be aware of the disability and indeed could not reasonably be assumed to have this knowledge. Where the Respondent is not aware of a disability, and no accommodation is requested, the duty to accommodate is not triggered.\nIn the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that the Respondent was not aware, nor could it reasonably be presumed to have been aware, of the Complainant's disability for the period from February 13, 1995 to April 1998. The Respondent was not on notice that accommodation was required and the evidence before me does not support that the Respondent had reason to suspect that the Complainant required accommodation during this period. (My emphasis.)\n[110] The factual situation in this case is, in many ways, different from the Gardiner case. Here, taking into consideration the context, I have concluded that the Respondent was aware or should have been aware of the Complainant's disability. Although there was no formal notice requesting accommodation before October 22, 2001, the various discussions that the Complainant had with her supervisor and manager, as their written notes clearly indicate, show that this is what was being sought.\n[111] In this case the Respondent led no evidence with respect to its efforts to try to accommodate the Complainant. The fact that it reviewed the Complainant's job description and made one or two phone calls to market the Complainant cannot be seen as an effort to accommodate her up to the point of undue hardship. Following the Complainant's formal request for accommodation on October 22, 2001, what the Respondent could have done is explore with her whether she was willing to have them discuss the issue with her doctor. This would have allowed them to ascertain what accommodation measures she needed and make an informed decision as to whether these measures were reasonable or imposed an undue hardship. They chose not to adopt this course of action because they had made up their minds that this was a performance issue. It is important to remember that performance and disability are not unrelated, especially inasmuch as disability can affect an employee's performance. Not all performance problems are rooted in disability, but those that are usually require some measure of accommodation.\n[112] Ms. McIntyre acknowledged that she was aware that the Complainant had, in the past, asked for a lower level deployment because of health reasons. When asked if she had that kind of flexibility in the situation at issue here, she answered that this would not have been a wise decision from a managerial point of view. She added that to take such a course of action would have gone against the business decision that had been made. Ms. McIntyre added that she considered that the Complainant was a term employee and we don't change our total organizational structure and business decision when we could market a term employee to another office. After having discussed the Complainant's situation with a staffing consultant at the Respondent's regional office, the decision was made not to renew the Complainant's term contract on September 30, subject to a 30 day extension for job searching. In her evidence Ms. McIntyre indicated that it was not wise for the Complainant's continued good health and the operational requirements of the Foreign Workers Unit that the contract be renewed.\nVIII. CONCLUSION [113] Considering the factual situation of this case and the governing legal principles, I find that the Complainant was discriminated against on the basis of a disability contrary to section 7 of the Act. Hearing dates will be set in order to address the issue of damages and other relief sought.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJanuary 25, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT928\/4804\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMary Mellon v.

INTRODUCTION [1] On November 23, 2003, Richard Warman filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against Craig Harrison. Mr. Warman's complaint alleges that Mr. Harrison is discriminating against persons or groups of persons on the basis of religion, race, colour, and national or ethnic origin by repeatedly communicating messages through an Internet Website that would likely expose Italians, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Haitians, francophones, blacks, First Nations persons, East Asians, non-whites and Jews to hatred and contempt contrary to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission, the (Commission) fully participated at the hearing into the complaint and was represented by legal counsel.\nII. FAILURE OF CRAIG HARRISON TO BE PRESENT AND ATTEND THE WHOLE HEARING [3] Mr. Harrison attended the opening of the hearing on June 12, 2006. He had requested that he be represented by his common law wife, Ms. Susen Holmes. Less than ninety minutes into the hearing and during Mr. Warman's testimony, Mr. Harrison started yelling at the witness forcing the Tribunal to order an adjournment. Mr. Harrison then stormed out of the hearing room while still yelling obscenities at Mr. Warman.\n[4] At the resumption of the hearing, neither Mr. Harrison nor Ms. Holmes were present. I then adjourned the hearing until June 13, 2006 and ordered that a letter be served on Mr. Harrison informing him that the hearing would resume on that date and, should he not be present, the Tribunal would proceed in his absence.\n[5] An Affidavit of Paul Mitchell, a process server from the City of Brampton, was filed as evidence. In his affidavit, Mr. Mitchell informed the Tribunal that he attended at the Respondent's residence in Georgetown, Ontario, at 4:10 p.m. on June 12, 2006 to serve the Tribunal's letter on Mr. Harrison. There being no answer, he attended again at the same address at 7:30 p.m. and again there was no answer. He further added that he heard voices inside the house and that he continued to knock but no one answered the door. He then left a copy of the Tribunal's letter in an envelope addressed to Craig Harrison stuck in the door. Five minutes latter, he phoned the residence and a woman who identified herself as Susen Holmes answered and told him that she had found the letter and would make sure that Craig Harrison received it.\n[6] On June 13, 2006, the Tribunal was informed by Ms. Holmes via telephone that Mr. Harrison would not participate in the hearing.\n[7] The Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. Harrison and his representative Ms. Holmes had notice that the hearing would resume at 9:30 a.m. on June 13, 2006 and that they chose not to participate.\nIII. THE ISSUES [8] Insofar as Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint is concerned, there are three issues that must be considered in determining whether the complaint has been made out:\nDid Mr. Harrison communicate, or cause to be communicated, repeatedly, the messages found on the various Websites in issue? Were these messages communicated in whole or in part by means of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament? Is the subject matter of the messages likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination?\n[9] In the event that the complaint is substantiated, the issue of the appropriate remedy will also have to be addressed.\nIV. THE SECTION 13 COMPLAINT A. General Approach [10] Section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S. 1985, chap. H-6, (the Act) reads as follows:\n13. (1) It is a discriminatory practice for a person or a group of persons acting in concert to communicate telephonically or to cause to be so communicated, repeatedly, in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, any matter that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. 13. (1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, d'utiliser ou de faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement pour aborder ou faire aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3.\n[11] Section 13(2) extends this provision to communications made on the Internet:\n(2) For greater certainty, subsection (1) applies in respect of a matter that is communicated by means of a computer or a group of interconnected or related computers, including the Internet, or any similar means of communication, but does not apply in respect of a matter that is communicated in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a broadcasting undertaking. (2) Il demeure entendu que le paragraphe (1) s'applique \u00e0 l'utilisation d'un ordinateur, d'un ensemble d'ordinateurs connect\u00e9s ou reli\u00e9s les uns aux autres, notamment d'Internet, ou de tout autre moyen de communication semblable mais qu'il ne s'applique pas dans les cas o\u00f9 les services d'une entreprise de radiodiffusion sont utilis\u00e9s.\n[12] The Act is especially designed to prevent the spread of prejudice and to foster tolerance and equality. The purpose of the Act is found in section 2 which states:\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted. 2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n[13] It is this purpose - the promotion of equal opportunity unhindered by discriminatory practices based on the enumerated grounds - which informs the objective of section 13(1). In denoting the activity described in this section as a discriminatory practice, Parliament has indicated that it views repeated telephonic communications likely to expose individuals or groups to hatred or contempt by reason of their being identifiable on the basis of certain characteristics as contrary to the furtherance of equality (See Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892).\n[14] It is also important to keep in mind that intent to discriminate is not a pre-condition to a finding of discrimination (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at pages 549-50; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, supra, at pages 931-34).\n[15] In Warman v. Kulbashian et al, 2006 CHRT 11 (C.H.R.T.), at paragraph 59, the Tribunal indicates:\n[The] language of section 13 is clear, in that it is the effect of messages that has attracted the attention of Parliament. The question to be asked is not whether the conveyor of the message intended to communicate hate or contempt, but whether the message itself is likely to expose persons belonging to the identifiable groups to hatred or contempt. If indeed the newsletter's content was intended to express a supposed political opinion, the message could have been communicated without resort to the extremist and denigrating language that pervades the various editions of the newsletter...\n[16] In Nealy v. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, at para. 45697, the Tribunal stated that the use of the word likely in s. 13(1) means that it is not necessary that evidence be adduced to prove that any particular individual or group took the messages seriously and directed hatred or contempt towards others. Nor is it necessary to show that anyone was so victimized. Unlike the other sections in the Act dealing with discrimination, s. 13(1) provides for liability where there is no proven or provable discriminatory impact. As commented by the Tribunal in Warman v. Winnicki, 2006 CHRT 20, at paras. 46 and 49:\n[46] ... The Tribunal alluded to the difficulty involved in determining how many people had received the message and to gauging the impact of the message on these people. This, in the Tribunal's view, justified the extension of liability under s. 13(1) to cases where there is no proven or provable actual discriminatory effect.\n[49] ...Section 13(1) makes it a discriminatory practice to communicate messages that are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt. The provision does not state that it is a discriminatory practice to communicate messages that cause others to feel hatred or contempt toward members of the targeted group.\n[17] Hate messages can cause harm in two significant ways. First they undermine the dignity and self-worth of the targeted group members and secondly they erode the tolerance and open-mindedness that must flourish in a multi-cultural society that is committed to the idea of equality (Winnicki, supra, at para. 50.) Therefore proof of harm is not required.\n[18] As the Federal Court stated in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Winnicki, 2005 FC 1493, at para. 30:\nThe damage caused by hate messages to the groups targeted is very often difficult to repair. It insidiously reinforces the prejudice that some people may have towards minorities identified by race, color, ethnic origin and religion, thus prompting and justifying discriminatory practices and even violence against these groups. At the same time, these messages are most likely to affect the perception and self-esteem of all members of these groups, thus preclu ding their full participation in Canadian society and the achievement of their full potential as human beings.\n[19] How is the likelihood of exposure to harm to be determined? In Citron v. Z\u00fcndel, (No. 4) (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/274, the Tribunal stated that the most persuasive evidence was the language used in the messages themselves. There is no need for expert evidence on this matter although it could be helpful in certain cases.\n[20] As stated earlier, three elements must be proven on a balance of probabilities to establish a violation of section 13 :\nDid the Respondent communicate or cause to be communicated repeatedly the material which is subject of the complaint? Were these messages communicated in whole or in part by means of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament? Is the subject matter of the messages likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination?\nB. Did Mr. Harrison communicate or cause to be communicated repeatedly the messages found on the Websites in issue? [21] Mr. Warman's interest in the area of hate groups and hate propaganda began approximately 15 years ago when he started monitoring the activities of various individuals that were prominent within white supremacist and Neo-Nazi groups. Five or six years ago, with the advent of the Internet, he became interested in its use by these groups and by individuals promoting similar ideas to disseminate hate propaganda.\n[22] His complaint relates to messages posted on different Websites. One of these Websites is called Freedomsite. This Website is described by Mr. Warman as a collection of a number of different white supremacist or Neo-Nazi groups. According to the complainant, the opening page of the message board of this Website includes a list of Conferences which includes headings entitled Immigration, Religion, Enemies of Freedom, and Jokes and Trivia. Under these headings individual threads were posted. Threads can be described as subcategories to the broader headings in the Conferences.\n[23] He states that he visited the Freedomsite Website and its message board on various occasions and that during these visits he found that seventy-one (71) messages had been posted between May 13, 2002 and January 21, 2003, by an individual using the login names realcanadianson and rump. To be more precise the messages under the login name realcanadianson were posted during five days between May 13 and May 21, 2002; those using the login name rump appeared on November 13, 2002, as well as on January 19 and January 21, 2003. Finally, as we will see later, other messages using the login name realnorthamerican were posted between January 27 and January 24, 2004 and again on February 2 and 5, 2004 on another Website.\n[24] In the course of his research, Mr. Warman sought to learn the identity of this person. He noticed that all the postings using the login names realcanadianson also included the email address susen@sympatico.ca. According to Bell Sympatico's account information, this email address is that of Susen Holmes whose residence is the same as that of Craig Harrison, the Respondent, in Georgetown, Ontario.\n[25] Furthermore, on the issue of identity, a print-off of a page from the Freedomsite posted in May 2002, by realcanadianson susen@sympatico.ca had the following message: i did two years in jail for kicking a half breed chink, spear chucker in 96. In another posting on May 14, 2002, again from realcanadianson susen@sympatico.ca, we can read: you're my hero. i got 2 years in jail in 96 because i beat down a half breed child molestor (sic) in Georgetown ont. hey im (sic) a hero too. Again on the same day another posting from realcanadianson susen@sympatico.ca: i went to jail for 2 years because i punched out a fucken nigger in georgetown. i am a real canadian hero like my grandfathers in the wars wre (sic). hey guess what?the french didnt fight in the wars because they were cowards and should be driven into the sea. On May 16, 2002, the same person using the same login name and email address posted the following message: skin head remember me?im (sic) the guy from georgetown who got 2 years for thumpin that nigger on main street.come back soon .we need you here for the cause.god bless and take care.\n[26] The evidence shows that in 1996, Mr. Harrison was convicted for assault causing bodily harm and was sentenced to two years less a day in jail. This assault occurred in Georgetown, Ontario.\n[27] A newspaper article, dated May 29, 1996, from the Georgetown Independent entitled Store owner viciously attacked, describes an assault on a business owner of Chinesse-African background, in front of his store on Main Street, in Georgetown. It adds that the individual who had been charged with the assault was one Craig Harrison. The article specifies that the victim was in front of his business when he was approached by a young white man who shouted racial slurs, pushed him to the ground and started punching and kicking him.\n[28] During his brief appearance before the Tribunal, Mr. Harrison did not deny that he was responsible for the events described in the article. On the contrary, while Mr. Warman was giving evidence regarding this incident, Mr. Harrison took offence to the characterization of this attack as being racially motivated. He started yelling: It wasn't racist...Nothing racist about it. Got it? Good. Let's go[talking to Susen Holmes] have a smoke. This guy's a jerk. Mr. Harrison also used other abusive words which were not recorded. This attitude and the aggressive reaction of Mr. Harrison confirms in my mind that he is the same person as the one referred to in the newspaper article.\n[29] Court documents referring to this incident were also put into evidence. These documents were issued by the Central West Region Criminal Court and they refer to charges against Mr. Harrison for the assault in Georgetown. Mr. Harrison's address on these documents is exactly the same as the one the Tribunal has on file and where the process server delivered the Tribunal's letter on June 12, 2006.\n[30] Mr. Warman further testified that after seeing the email address susen@sympatico.ca on the various postings using the pseudonym realcanadianson, it was fairly easy for him to do a search on that email address. What resulted from this search was a posting, dated December 4, 2002, in a guestbook of another Website hosted by Canadian Heritage Alliance, in which Craig Harrison had identified himself by name. He had then given his email address as susen@sympatico.ca, and indicated that he lived in Georgetown, Ontario, Dominion of Canada(sic).\n[31] Mr. Warman's searches also turned up a certain number of postings under the login name rump. These posting are very similar in style to the one posted by realcanadianson. They were all in lower case lettering, had the same sort of run-through punctuation and basically covered the same topics in terms of the targets of the attack. One posting in particular dated November 13, 2002, was signed c s h a real canadian. According to Mr. Warman, the importance of this signature for identity purposes is that Mr. Harrison's full name, as indicated in the court documents, is Craig Steven Harrison (initials C.S.H.).\n[32] Furthermore, in some of the posting using the login name rump, the author identifies his home town as being Georgetown.\n[33] An affidavit by Hannya Rizk, an investigator with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, dated June 8, 2006, was put into evidence by the Commission. The Respondent, who at that time was still present at the hearing, did not oppose the filing of this affidavit, nor did he ask to cross-examine its author.\n[34] In the Investigator's Report annexed to her affidavit, Ms. Rizk indicated that on February 25, 2004, Mr. Harrison called the Commission and provided his defence to the complaint over the phone. He was asked by Ms. Rizk if he had ever visited the Freedomsite Website. He responded that he had, on that day, but that he could not access it because it had been shut down. He was then asked if he had visited the site prior to February 25, 2004 and he answered that he might have. She also asked if he had ever posted messages on the Website, he answered that he might have.\n[35] Ms. Rizk asked Mr. Harrison if he had ever used the pseudonyms realcanadianson and rump. He answered `no' adding that he did not have an email address but that he did use on occasion the email address of his girlfriend Susen Holmes, which he identified as being susen@sympatico.ca.\n[36] During the hearing, the Commission also filed as evidence an affidavit from Marc Lemire, the webmaster of the Freedomsite.org Website, which up until January 2004 included the message board where the messages with the login names realcanadianson and rump were posted. Mr. Lemire explained in his affidavit that to register a user account on the message board, a person had to give his first and last name, his login name and an email address. He added that there was no verification done on the first and last name or the login name. The only verification was to ensure that a valid email address was provided. When an individual signed up a new account, a password was emailed to the address he or she provided.\n[37] In his affidavit, Mr. Lemire annexed the user profile for the login names realcanadianson and rump. For the login name realcanadianson, the user's name was given as Craig Harrison, the location was Georgetown, Ontario and the email address was susen@sympatico.ca. For rump the user's name was registered as Lomp Pomp and the location was given as Yukom, Ontario polop2. It is obvious that these are fictional. The email address though is still susen@sympatico.ca, the same as the one used by realcanadianson.\n[38] Mr. Warman further alleges that Mr. Harrison is responsible for postings on another Website located at www.ypenterprise.net, which is host to a forum called Yoderanium under the login name realnorthamerican. There are a lot of similarities in the style used and in the themes advocated by realnorthamerican and those of realcanadianson and rump. The characterization of French Canadian as cowards and draft dodger is a recurrent theme in all of these postings. Also a very distinctive trait is the attacks on people of Dutch origin on the immigration that followed the Second World War and the references to former Prime Minister Trudeau. Although the evidence concerning the login name realnorthamerican is circumstantial, it is sufficient to establish a prima facie case that realcanadianson is another login name used by Mr. Harrison.\n[39] The ultimate burden rests on the complainant and the Commission to establish their case on a balance of probabilities. Once a prima facie case has been made out, it is incumbent upon the Respondent to provide a reasonable explanation demonstrating that he was not the author of the offending messages, that the alleged discrimination never occurred or that his conduct was somehow non-discriminatory.\n[40] In his reply to the complaint, Mr. Harrison and his representative, Susen Holmes suggested that he had been wrongly accused and that in fact, they did not at the relevant time own a computer or that another individual had used their computer and posted the messages. They indicated that they looked forward to presenting their versions of the facts. But they opted otherwise and decided that they would not participate in the hearing or lead evidence to support their explanations. The Tribunal cannot take stock of mere hints or innuendos tossed in the reply to the complaint, if there is ultimately no evidence introduced to sustain these assertions.\n[41] Mr. Harrison's decision not to give evidence or to submit himself to cross-examination allows the Tribunal to draw an inference that his evidence may indeed have been detrimental to him. In Nealy v. Johnston, supra, the Tribunal noted at paragraph 45628 :\nAs Sopinka and Lederman, supra state:\n[F]ailure on the part of a defendant to testify...once a prima facie case has been made out against the defendant, may be the subject of an adverse inference. (p. 537)\nThe learned authors also note that an unfavourable inference can also be drawn when a party litigant does not testify or fails to call a witness, who would have knowledge of the facts, and who might have given important supporting evidence if the case of the litigant had been sound. (p. 145).\n[42] In the present case, Mr. Harrison did not testify, nor did he call anyone else as a witness. As I indicated earlier, a prima facie case has been made out by the complainant that Mr. Harrison posted these messages and, under the circumstances of this case, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to draw an adverse inference from the Respondent's decision not to offer a reply.\n[43] Based on the evidence before me, I find that Craig Harrison is the author of the messages posted on the Freedomsite and of those posted in the Yoderanium forum under the login names realcanadianson, rump and realamericanson.\n[44] In regards to the element of repetition, the Tribunal held in Schnell supra, at para. 129, that the use of the word repeatedly in s. 13(1) suggests that this section is aimed not at private communications with friends, but rather at a series of messages that form a larger-scale, public scheme for the dissemination of certain ideas or opinions, designed to gain converts from the public (See Warman v. Winnicki, 2006 CHRT 20, at para. 36). I am of the view that Internet messages exchanged on a Website accessible to anyone are not intended to be private communications. I note that in the present case, Mr. Warman had no difficulty surfing his way to the Websites where these messages were posted. Since these messages could be viewed at any time by anyone using the Internet, they were indeed being communicated repeatedly.\n[45] The fact that a Website is a somewhat passive medium, requiring the reader to take positive steps in order to access the posted material does not detract from the fact that in up-loading the messages to the Websites, Mr. Harrison communicated the material in issue (See Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc, 43 C.H.R.R. d\/453, at para,127; and, Warman v. Kyburz, 2003 CHRT 18, at para. 9).\n[46] Furthermore, by using the Internet, the slow, insidious effect of a relatively isolated bigoted commentary as described in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Liberty Net, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 626, at para 48, where the telephone was being used, has now changed to a form of communication having a widespread circulation. The messages on the Internet are much more easily accessible and pervasive than any previous telecommunication medium. The content of a Website can also easily be mirrored and replicated ad infinitum with virtually no control by the originator (Barrick Gold Corp. v. Lopehandia, [2004] O.J. No. 2329).\n[47] Therefore, I conclude that the Complainant and the Commission have established a prima facie case that Craig Harrison did communicate or cause to be communicated repeatedly the messages found on the Websites in issue.\nC. Were these messages communicated in whole or in part by means of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament? [48] The substantive evidence against Mr. Harrison consists primarily of copies of email postings on the Internet.\n[49] The Canadian Human Rights Act, as it was originally enacted, did not explicitly deal with Internet communications. As part of the changes to Canadian law effected by the proclamation of the Anti-Terrorism Act, S.C. 2001, c. 41, section 88, on December 24, 2001, the Canadian Human Rights Act was amended to add subsection 13(2) supra, which deals expressly with matters communicated by means of the Internet.\n[50] Since all the messages which form the basis of this complaint, were posted after the enactment of section 13(2), there is no issue that they were communicated in whole or in part by means of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament. Even if this had not been the case, we must remember that the earlier version of section 13 had been found to encompass Internet communications in both Citron et al v. Z\u00fcndel, supra, and in Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc. et al, supra.\nD. Is the subject matter of the messages likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? (i) What is the subject matter of the messages communicated by Mr. Harrison? [51] In his complaint, Mr. Warman alleges that Mr. Harrison posted messages, which would likely expose Italians, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Haitians, francophones, blacks, First Nations persons, East Asians, non-whites and Jews to hatred and contempt, by reason of their religion, national or ethnic origin, race or colour.\n[52] While the language used is quite offensive and debasing, to say the least, I feel that it is relevant to the issues to be resolved to quote from some of these messages. The following are excerpts of the messages posted by Mr. Harrison under the various login names:\nUnder the login name realcanadianson :\nMay 14, 2002 12:06 A.M.\nwhy does aqua velva come in different colours? because indians like shooters too.\n12:08 A.M.\nwhat does an indian woman say when she is losing her virinity (sic)?

There may be elements of a legitimate political debate, although I fail to see them, in some of these postings and nobody would quarrel with the fact that the Respondent has a right to his political views. But it is also clear that the majority of these postings go beyond the legal parameters of public debate and contravene the provisions of the Act. The call for violence toward Aboriginals, francophones, blacks and other non-whites, as well as attacks on others groups and individuals based on their religion, colour, national or ethnic origin using racial slurs and degrading stereotypes does not constitute legitimate political debate. It promotes hatred and contempt.\n[54] The themes of these postings deal essentially with the killing of non-whites and other targeted communities such as the French Canadians, blacks and people of the Jewish faith. They exhort whites to do the killing because, according to the author god has instructed them to do so or because god gave Canada to the white man. They attack in a demeaning and humiliating way members of various cultural and religious communities. We can feel in these posting an obsessive hatred of the aboriginal, francophone and, for that matter, of all communities who are not white, Christian or from English ancestry.\n(ii) Are these messages likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? [55] In order to address this question, the meaning of the words expose, hatred and contempt must be considered. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, as well as the Federal Court and the Supreme Court of Canada, have had occasions to consider the meaning of these terms in previous decisions.\n[56] The terms hatred and contempt have been judicially considered in previous section 13 cases. In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada cited with approval the definitions of theses terms in Nealy v. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450 at 6469 (C.H.R.T.). In Nealy, the Tribunal said:\nAs there is no definition of hatred or contempt within the [Canadian Human Rights Act] it is necessary to rely on what might be described as common understandings of the meaning of these terms. Clearly these are terms which have a potentially emotive content and how they are related to particular factual contexts by different individuals will vary. There is nevertheless an important core of meaning in both, which the dictionary definitions capture. With hatred the focus is a set of emotions and feelings which involve extreme ill will towards another person or group of persons. To say that one hates another means in effect that one finds no redeeming qualities in the latter. It is a term, however, which does not necessarily involve the mental process of looking down on another or others. It is quite possible to hate someone who one feels is superior to one in intelligence, wealth or power. None of the synonyms used in the dictionary definition for hatred give any clues to the motivation for the ill will. Contempt is by contrast a term which suggests a mental process of looking down upon or treating as inferior the object of one's feelings.\n[57] The Tribunal in Nealy also considered the meaning of the word expose as it is used in section 13:\nExpose is an unusual word to find in legislation to control hate propaganda. More frequently, as in the Broadcasting Act Regulations, Post Office Act provisions and in the various related sections of the Criminal Code, the reference is to matter which is abusive or offensive, or to statements which serve to incite or promote hatred.\nIncite means to stir up; promote means to support actively. Expose is a more passive word, which seems to indicate that an active effort or intent on the part of the communicator or a violent reaction on the part of the recipient are not envisaged. To expose to hatred also indicates a more subtle and indirect type of communication than vulgar abuse or overtly offensive language. Expose means: to leave a person unprotected; to leave without shelter or defence; to lay open (to danger, ridicule, censure etc.). In other words, if one is creating the right conditions for hatred to flourish, leaving the identifiable group open or vulnerable to ill-feelings or hostility, if one is putting them at risk of being hated, in a situation where hatred or contempt are inevitable, one falls within the compass of section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n(See also the Tribunal's decision in Schnell, supra, at paras. 85-89)\n[58] In my view, there can be no doubt that the messages contained in the postings are likely to expose persons who are non-Christian, non-Caucasian and non-English in origin, to hatred or contempt. These persons are laid open to ridicule, ill feelings, hostility and violence creating the right conditions for hatred or contempt against them to flourish.\n[59] The supposed humour found in postings under the heading Jokes unquestionably exposes these groups to hatred and contempt. These jokes blatantly treat people of the Jewish faith and aboriginals with disdain and as being inferior. They are demeaning and disdainful. In general, the messages serve to dehumanize people belonging to the targeted groups. The use of racial slurs and degrading stereotypes are derogatory, insulting, offensive and of themselves they display hatred and contempt in regard to these groups. The call for violence against members of these groups denotes feelings of extreme ill will.\n[60] The author's extreme ill will and malevolence towards these groups pervades these postings. Statements exhorting violence and death, suggest that the victims lack any redeeming qualities, thereby dehumanizing them. These comments unquestionably expose the members of these groups to hatred, contempt and real physical danger by suggesting that they are legitimate targets of indiscriminate violence. These messages serve to develop and encourage envy, mistrust or resentment towards these individuals and groups, which in turn breeds hatred against them.\n[61] For all these reasons, I conclude that the messages are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nE. Finding regarding the section 13 complaint [62] Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that an individual has the freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media.... This right to hold and express one's opinions is a cornerstone of a free and democratic society and a right that Canadians value dearly. It also forms part of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[63] In the Taylor case supra, the Supreme Court of Canada had occasion to scrutinize the reach of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in light of the fundamental guarantee of freedom of opinion and expression protected by international law and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court concluded that while section 13 infringed the right of freedom of opinion and expression, this infringement was justified in light of Canada's international commitments to eradicate hate propaganda and its commitment to the values of equality and multiculturalism.\n[64] As this Tribunal has already stated, the values underpinning hate propaganda are fundamentally inimical, even antithetical to the rationale underlying the protection of freedom of expression and directly contradict other values equally vindicated by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Winnicki, 2005 FC 1493, at para. 29).\n[65] I think it is fair to say that the materials that were posted on the Websites referred to earlier and of which I have reproduced extracts in this decision, are likely to expose people of the Jewish faith, Aboriginal, francophones, blacks and others to hatred and contempt. They are undoubtedly as vile as one can imagine and not only discriminatory but threatening to the victims they target.\n[66] Having found that Craig Harrison did communicate, repeatedly, by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, matters that are likely to expose people or members of these groups to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, I conclude that Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint is substantiated.\nV. REMEDY [67] Having substantiated Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint, the final issue to be determined is that of remedy.\nA. Cease and Desist Order [68] Where a section 13 complaint is substantiated, section 54(1)a) of the Act empowers the Tribunal to order the Respondent to cease the discriminatory practice, and to take measures in consultation with the Commission to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in the future. The process of hearing a complaint and, if the complaint is substantiated, issuing a cease and desist order serves to remind Canadians of our fundamental commitment to equality of opportunity and the eradication of racial and religious intolerance.\n[69] A cease and desist order brings to a respondent's attention the fact that his or her messages are likely to have a harmful effect. Uncertainty or mistake as to the probable effect of these messages is thus dissipated and consequently their continued promulgation will be accompanied by the knowledge that certain individuals or groups are likely to be exposed to hatred or contempt on the basis of race or religion.\n[70] Messages posted by individuals on various Websites of the Internet present a particular challenge for the Tribunal in crafting a meaningful remedy. As the Tribunal said in Warman v. Kyburz, supra, at par. 81 : The unique nature of Internet technology, including the jurisdictional challenges arising from the borderless world of cyberspace, as well as the `moving targets' created by the use of mirror sites raise real concerns as to the efficacy of cease and desist orders in relation to hate messages disseminated on the Internet.\n[71] Despite these challenges, I adopt the words of the Tribunal in the Z\u00fcndel decision supra, at para 300:\nAny remedy awarded by this Tribunal, will inevitably serve a number of purposes: prevention and elimination of discriminatory practices is only one of the outcome flowing from an Order issued as a consequence of these proceedings. There is also a significant symbolic value in the public denunciation of the actions that are the subject of this complaint. Similarly, there is the potential educative and ultimately the larger preventive benefit that can be achieved by open discussion of the principles enunciated in this or any Tribunal decision.\n[72] Therefore, a cease and desist order can have both a practical and symbolic effect. On a practical side, it will prevent the Respondent from continuing to communicate material of the nature described in this decision. On the symbolic side there is an important value to the public denunciation of the actions which form the subject matter of this complaint.\n[73] Accordingly the Tribunal orders that Craig Harrison or any other individuals who act in concert with Craig Harrison, cease the discriminatory practice of communicating telephonically or causing to be communicated telephonically by means of facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, material of the type that was found to violate section 13(1) in the present case, or any other messages of a substantially similar content that are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that a person, or persons, are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, contrary to section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal orders that Craig Harrison cease and desist from posting any such messages on the Internet immediately upon being notified of the Tribunal's decision.\nB. Penalty [74] Subsection 54(1)c) of the Act allows the Tribunal to order a respondent in a section 13 complaint to pay a penalty of up to $10,000. As was indicated by this Tribunal in Warman v. Kyburz, supra, at para. 92, [t]he inclusion of this provision in the 1998 amendments to the Act represents a significant departure from the traditional approach that damage awards in human rights cases were primarily remedial and not punitive.\n[75] In deciding whether to order Mr. Harrison to pay a penalty in this case, Parliament has directed that the Tribunal take several factors into account. Subsection 54(1.1) provides:\n(1.1) In deciding whether to order the person to pay the penalty, the member or panel shall take into account the following factors:\n(a) the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice; and\n(b) the wilfulness or intent of the person who engaged in the discriminatory practice, any prior discriminatory practices that the person has engaged in and the person's ability to pay the penalty.\n(1.1) Il tient compte, avant d'imposer la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a (1)c) :\na) de la nature et de la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que des circonstances l'entourant;\nb) de la nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte, des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de son auteur et de sa capacit\u00e9 de payer.\n[76] Each of these factors will be considered in turn. Insofar as the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Harrison repeatedly communicated messages regarding persons who are non-Christian, non-Caucasian and non-English in origin that were nasty, vicious and extreme. These persons were laid open to ridicule, ill feelings, hostility and violence creating the right conditions for hatred or contempt against them. The messages are demeaning and disdainful. They serve to dehumanize people belonging to the targeted groups. The use of racial slurs and degrading stereotypes are derogatory, insulting and offensive. The repeated call for violence against members of these groups denotes feelings of extreme ill will. Statements exhorting violence and death, suggest that the victims lack any redeeming qualities, thereby dehumanizing them. These comments unquestionably expose the members of these groups to hatred, contempt and real physical danger by suggesting that they are legitimate targets of indiscriminate violence. These messages serve to develop and encourage envy, mistrust or resentment towards these individuals and groups, which in turn, breeds hatred against them.\n[77] I find that the messages clearly demonstrate that its author is being led by his ill-conceived views of society and his incapacity to accept others. The evidence clearly establishes that the Respondent intended to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred and contempt and that he intended to convince people to think as he did. He clearly communicated his messages in wilful disregard of the likely consequences of his conduct. I also take notice of the fact that the Respondent has previously been found guilty of an assault on an individual which was racially motivated.\n[78] On the mitigating side, I also find that the messages put in evidence were posted in a relatively short period of time and that there seems to have been no new posting since 2004. Also, I note that the Respondent is not responsible for the Websites; he is but a participant to these various Websites. No evidence was introduced to show that there is a possibility of any recurrence of such postings by the Respondent.\n[79] Subsection 54(1.1) mandates that the Tribunal consider the respondent's ability to pay a penalty before levying a fine. As was indicated by the Tribunal in the Warman v. Kyburz case supra, the burden of proof relating to the ability to pay rests with the respondent. Considering the decision of the Respondent not to participate in the hearing and submit evidence, there is no evidence before the Tribunal to suggest that Mr. Harrison may have limited resources.\n[80] Taking all of these factors into account, I order the Respondent to pay a penalty in the amount of $1,000. The order that the Respondent pay this penalty is imposed essentially by reason of the violent nature of the postings. Society cannot take lightly calls for the murder of persons because of their race, religion or ethnic origin.\n[81] Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order, payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 35 days of Mr. Harrison being notified of this decision.\nVI. ORDER [82] For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal declares that Mr. Warman's rights under the Canadian Human Rights Act have been contravened by Craig Harrison, and orders in relation to the section 13 violation that:\nCraig Harrison, and any other individuals who act in concert with Mr. Harrison cease the discriminatory practice of communicating telephonically or causing to be communicated telephonically by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking with the legislative authority of Parliament, material of the type that was found to violate section 13(1) in the present case, or any other messages of a substantially similar content, that are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred and contempt by reason of the fact that a person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, contrary to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Mr. Harrison shall pay a penalty in the amount of $ 1,000. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order, payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal within 35 days of Mr. Harrison being notified of this decision.\nsigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario August 15, 2006\n1 Wolfgan refers to Wolfgang Droege the then National Director of the Heritage Front, one of the groups that forms part of the Freedom site.\n2 d.p. stands for displaced persons a term used to identify post World War II refugees.\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T1072\/5305\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Richard Warman v.

Jensen\nI. THE MEMBERSHIP LIST(S) FOR CANADIAN HERITAGE ALLIANCE\nII. THE ROLE OF MR. ALEXAN KULBASHIAN IN THE PRESENT COMPLAINT\nIII. THE RESPONDENT'S ALLEGED NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRIBUNAL'S DIRECTIONS REGARDING DISCLOSURE\nIV. THE COMPLAINANT'S ALLEGED NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRIBUNAL'S DIRECTION REGARDING DISCLOSURE\n[1] This is a ruling on a number of issues that have arisen in a complaint brought by Richard Warman against Melissa Guille and Canadian Heritage Alliance. The complaint involves the alleged communication of hate messages contrary to s. 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The issues relate primarily to the disclosure of arguably relevant documents. I will deal with each in turn.\nI. The Membership List(s) for Canadian Heritage Alliance [3] In a letter dated July 12, 2006, the Tribunal directed the Respondents to provide the membership list or lists for Canadian Heritage Alliance during the relevant time period as this material was arguably relevant to the issues raised in the complaint. Ms. Guille requested an opportunity to argue that the Tribunal's direction be varied. The Tribunal granted Ms. Guille's request.\n[4] In her submissions, Ms. Guille argues that the only significance of a membership list, if such a list exists, is that it might establish whether or not the group has members and possibly the number of members. In this statement, Ms. Guille has correctly identified the arguable relevance of the membership list to the issues in the present matter. As indicated in the Tribunal's ruling of March 13, 2006, the question of whether Canadian Heritage Alliance is a group of persons acting in concert within the meaning of s. 13(1) of the Act is one that will be determined on the basis of a full evidentiary record (Warman v. Melissa Guille and Canadian Heritage Alliance 2006 CHRT 12). The membership list or lists, if they exist, are relevant to this issue.\n[5] Ms. Guille has stated that information regarding membership in Canadian Heritage Alliance may be elicited by other means or in the cross-examination of Ms. Guille if she chooses to testify. However, rule 6(1) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure stipulates that all arguably relevant documents for which no privilege is claimed, whether favourable to the parties' cases or not, must be disclosed. It does not matter whether the information might be obtained by other means. If the documents exist and are in the possession of the parties, they must be disclosed unless privilege is being claimed. Ms. Guille has not claimed that the document(s) in question are privileged.\n[6] It would appear that Ms. Guille's reluctance to disclose such list(s) is based on a concern that the Complainant might use the names on the list(s) for purposes unrelated to the present litigation. However, in cases such as this where disclosure of confidential documents is ordered, the implied undertaking rule applies. The rationale for this rule is that a party to litigation should have the full right of disclosure and inspection of relevant information, including that which is confidential, as is necessary to dispose fairly of the case. Nevertheless, parties are not permitted to use the disclosed material for any purpose collateral to the litigation (PSAC v. Canadian Museum of Civilization 2004 CHRT 38 at para. 12). As a lawyer, the Complainant is subject to professional obligations and rules of conduct that prohibit him from using the information from the list(s) for purposes that are unrelated to the present litigation.\n[7] Therefore, I order that Ms. Guille disclose the membership list or lists for Canadian Heritage Alliance in her possession for the relevant time periods.\nII. The Role of Mr. Alexan Kulbashian in the Present Complaint [8] During the June 22, 2006 case conference, Ms. Guille indicated that Mr. Alexan Kulbashian might be acting as her agent and may also be a witness for the Respondents. She requested that he be provided with copies of all correspondence regarding this matter. The Tribunal agreed to contact Mr. Kulbashian for all case management calls. The Tribunal will also provide Mr. Kulbashian with copies of all future correspondence on the file.\n[9] The Canadian Human Rights Commission put Ms. Guille on notice that if Mr. Kulbashian acts as her agent during the hearing, the Commission will object to Mr. Kulbashian testifying as a witness for the Respondents. The Commission subsequently requested an order from the Tribunal preventing Mr. Kulbashian from testifying at the hearing. That request is denied. It is unclear what role, if any, Mr. Kulbashian will play in the hearing. Therefore, any such order would be inappropriate at this time.\nIII. The Respondents' alleged non-compliance with the Tribunal's directions Regarding disclosure [10] In a letter dated July 21, 2006, the Commission indicated that the Respondents have failed to comply with a number of the directions provided by the Tribunal regarding disclosure in the case conference on June 22, 2006. The Commission has indicated that the following documents have yet to be disclosed:\nThe full resume of the Respondents' expert witness complete with background and qualifications as well as his speaking notes for the engagements specified in the report; Documents in the Respondents' possession relating to the hosting agreement for the website, whether it is an agreement, a contract, e-mails, etc. Documents in the Respondents' possession relating to the process used to ban individuals or to remove postings from the website.\n[11] In addition, the Commission indicated that the Respondents have not provided an updated list of their witnesses complete with a more detailed statement of the proposed testimony of each of the witnesses as directed by the Tribunal. Finally, the Respondents have failed to provide an amended Statement of Particulars outlining the nature of their defense specifically as it relates to the Expert Report.\n[12] Ms. Guille has indicated that she has not complied with the Tribunal's directions for further disclosure because she felt that as a result of her lack of legal experience and the Commission's failure to provide written notice of the disclosure demands, she was unable to understand what was being requested of her and to properly respond to those requests during the case conference of June 22, 2006.\n[13] Under the circumstances, I am prepared to give Ms. Guille two weeks from the date of this ruling to provide submissions as to why the Tribunal's directions regarding the disclosure of the above-noted documents should be varied.\nIV. The Complainant's alleged non-compliance with the Tribunal's direction Regarding disclosure [14] During a case conference on April 6, 2006, the Complainant was directed to provide any documents in his possession relating to accounts that he created on any website or forum related to the complaint. He was also directed to provide copies of any e-mails or communications that he had on these websites or forums. The Complainant responded to this direction by stating that he had no record of any postings he made on the Canadian Heritage Alliance forum or website.\n[15] The Respondents allege that Mr. Warman is not being truthful about the existence of such documents or that he has intentionally destroyed the documents in order to evade the disclosure requirements. The Respondents have requested an order from the Tribunal requiring the Complainant to answer an interrogatory in affidavit form in order to elicit full disclosure.\n[16] The Tribunal's Rules of Procedure stipulate that parties are required to disclose all arguably relevant documents that are in their possession. Parties are not required to create documents for disclosure (Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces 2005 CHRT 42). Requiring the Complainant to produce an affidavit would be tantamount to requiring the Complainant to create a document for disclosure. Therefore, I deny the Respondents' motion compelling Mr. Warman to produce an affidavit.\n[17] However, the Respondents are free to pose the questions in their interrogatory to the Complainant during cross-examination. In the meantime, the parties are reminded of their ongoing obligation to disclose all arguably relevant documents whether favourable to their cases or not.\nsigned by Karen A.

The orders requested in the Notice of Motion for Production of Documents (Constitutional Issues)\n[1] The Respondent, Marc Lemire, has filed two notices of motion. In the first motion, he seeks further particulars and disclosure from the Complainant, Richard Warman, and the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In the second motion, he requests production of documents from the Complainant and the Commission with respect to the constitutional issues. Both motions therefore relate to the parties' compliance with Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure.\n[2] According to Rule 6(1), each party must serve and file with the Tribunal a Statement of Particulars setting out:\n6(1)(a) the material facts that the party seeks to prove in support of its case; [and]\n6(1)(d) a list of all documents in the party's possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule.\n[3] A copy of any document identified under Rule 6(1)(d) must be provided to the other parties (Rule 6(4)).\n[4] Mr. Lemire is essentially alleging, a) that the material facts set out in Commission's and Mr. Warman's joint Statement of Particulars are insufficient or lacking in certain respects, and b) that they have not disclosed certain documents that should have been disclosed pursuant to Rule 6(1)(d).\n[5] In Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Northwest Territories (Minister of Personnel), [1999] C.H.R.D. No. 8 (C.H.R.T.)(QL), the Tribunal noted that the purpose of particulars is to define the issues, prevent surprises, enable the parties to prepare for trial, and facilitate the hearing. With respect specifically to the communication of material facts, the Tribunal stated that the basic rule is that the parties should disclose sufficient facts to permit the other parties to prepare themselves for the hearing. However, a party is only entitled to the material facts on which the other party is relying. It is not entitled to a summary of the evidence that the other party intends to call, nor its arguments and reasoning.\n[6] Regarding the disclosure of documents, Rule 6(1)(d) dictates that documents relating to facts, issues and relief sought in the case must be disclosed. The test for relevance for these purposes has been expressed as being whether the document in question is arguably relevant to the hearing (see Bushey v. Sharma, [2003] C.H.R.D. No. 7 (C.H.R.T.)(QL) at para. 4). The question of relevance was addressed by the Tribunal in Communication, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada v. Bell Canada, [2005] C.H.R.D. No. 34, (C.H.R.T.)(QL). Referring to the Supreme Court's findings in Smith & Nephew v. Glegg, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 724, the Tribunal noted that on issues of relevance, a party must show that disclosure of the document will be useful, is appropriate, is likely to contribute to advancing the debate and is based on an acceptable objective he or she seeks to attain in the case, and that the document is related to the dispute.\n[7] With these considerations in mind, I will now address the specific requests in Mr. Lemire's motions.\nI. The orders requested in the Notice of Motion for Further Particulars and Disclosure [8] At the end of this Notice of Motion, Mr. Lemire compiled an itemized list of orders that he is seeking from the Tribunal. I will address these requests item by item.\nA. Items a), b), c), d) and e) [9] Items a) through e) are similar in nature. The orders requested read as follows:\nThat the complainant provide the name(s) of the Internet Service Provider(s) he used to access freedomsite.org, stormfront.org and jrsbookonline.com in 2003 and 2004 and the account name he used; That the complainant provide the location of the computer(s) which he used to access the freedomsite.org (ie. - home or from the offices of the Commission); That the complainant provide the email or emails he used to gain access to the freedomsite.org message board; That the complainant provide the password or passwords he used to gain access to the freedomsite.org message board; That the complainant provide the log-in name(s) (or pseudonym(s)) he used while on the freedomsite.org message board.\n[10] These appear to be requests for further particulars, as opposed to disclosure of any specific documents. In the material facts section of Mr. Warman's and the Commission's joint Statement of Particulars, dated December 7, 2005, it is stated that the alleged hate messages were viewed by Mr. Warman on the freedomsite.org, stormfront.org and jrsbooksonline.com websites in November 2003 and October 2004.\n[11] Mr. Lemire contends that in order to gain access to these websites and the chat lines found therein, one must register with the message board or enter as a guest using a computer with a unique Internet Protocol Address. To gain full access, a valid e-mail address must be provided. Mr. Lemire claims that he requires the particulars being sought under these items of his motion in order to check the log files of the message board and confirm that Mr. Warman is telling the truth.\n[12] In my view, the material facts provided by Mr. Warman and the Commission regarding the websites visited and the dates of these visits are sufficient to allow Mr. Lemire to prepare for the hearing. Mr. Lemire has effectively been placed on notice that Mr. Warman intends to prove that he visited these sites and viewed the alleged hate messages. It will be up to Mr. Warman and the Commission to prove these facts. Any issues regarding the accuracy or veracity of the evidence regarding these visits can be more appropriately explored by Mr. Lemire through cross-examination.\n[13] The orders requested in Items a), b), c), d), and e) are therefore denied.\nB. Item f) [14] The item requested reads as follows:\nf) That the complainant provide copies of all printouts he made from freedomsite.org during the times he visited it and its message board;\n[15] In support of this request, Mr. Lemire argued in his motion that Mr. Warman may have made printouts of other messages that he decided not to use in the complaint and that if he printed out other messages from the web board, why did he not include them in the complaint?\n[16] An obvious answer may be that Mr. Warman did not perceive the other material as being in violation of the Canadian Human Rights Act and therefore did not include it in the complaint. Nonetheless, I am prepared to accept that any document in the possession of a party relating to the messages referred to in the complaint may be arguably relevant to the facts at issue in this case. I therefore order Mr. Warman to disclose, in accordance with Rules 6(1)(d) and 6(4), copies that are in his possession of any printouts he made from freedomsite.org and its message board during the times he visited them, prior to filing his complaint.\nC. Item g) [17] The item requested reads as follows:\ng) That the complainant provide copies of all messages which he posted on the freedomsite.org message board and the stormfront.org message board or any replies to messages that he posted on these web boards;\n[18] Mr. Lemire claims in his motion that it is somehow relevant to this case whether Mr. Warman tried to refute the alleged hate messages or to advise the message board participants that some of the messages being posted were racist. With respect, I fail to see how this is relevant to the issues arising from the complaint. If the evidence establishes that Mr. Lemire communicated or caused to be communicated hate messages in the manner contemplated in s. 13 of the Act, his liability will be engaged, irrespective of Mr. Warman's actions or omissions.\n[19] Mr. Lemire goes on to say, however, that the manner and ease with which people of opposing views can participate on those message boards may be relevant to the issues that he has raised regarding the constitutional validity of s. 13 of the Act. I am satisfied that Mr. Warman's postings are arguably relevant in this respect.\n[20] Mr. Warman is therefore ordered to provide any copies in his possession of messages that he posted on the freedomsite.org and stormfront.org message boards, or any replies that he posted on these web boards.\nD. Item h) [21] The item requested reads as follows:\nh) That the complainant and the Canadian Human Rights Commission produce all documents relating to the identity of the person who posted the messages on the respondent's message board under the name Craig Harrison which is in their possession or which comes into their possession.\n[22] In his reply to the submissions of the other parties, dated June 29, 2006, Mr. Lemire acknowledged that he was in the process of receiving the documents requested under this item. I can only assume that this request is therefore withdrawn.\nE. Item i) [23] The item requested reads as follows:\ni) That the complainant and the Commission produce a compilation of those messages which they allege to constitute hate messages within the meaning of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act with appropriate markups of those parts specifically relied upon as exposing persons to hatred or contempt.\n[24] Mr. Lemire points out in his motion that the Commission and Mr. Warman produced over 133 pages of messages as part of their disclosure, in which one finds hundreds of messages. None of the messages have any underlining or marking to indicate which portions are alleged to expose groups to hatred or contempt.\n[25] Mr. Warman contends that he has provided sufficient particulars. He indicates in his submissions that his original complaint sets out 29 examples of the type of material from the disclosed documents that he alleges violate s. 13(1) of the Act. He contends that this is sufficient to fulfill his disclosure obligations and provide Mr. Lemire the ability to know the case that must be met.\n[26] I disagree. To put forth over a hundred pages of messages and then reserve the right to pick out any one of these messages and argue at the hearing that it constitutes a violation of s. 13(1) of the Act, denies him a true and effective opportunity to know the case that he must meet. If the Commission and Mr. Warman take the position that each message found on each of the disclosed pages constitutes a hate message, then they should so indicate explicitly. Mr. Lemire can then consider himself forewarned and can prepare himself accordingly.\n[27] However, if the Commission and Mr. Warman believe in good faith that only a number of the messages in the disclosed pages are in violation of the Act, then they should be forthright in declaring and detailing their positions to the other party.\n[28] The Commission and Mr. Warman are therefore ordered to identify specifically those messages that they allege constitute hate messages within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act.\nII. The orders requested in the Notice of Motion for Production of Documents (Constitutional Issues) [29] On November 25, 2005, Mr. Lemire filed a Notice of Constitutional Question in the present case, in which he alleged that ss. 13 and 54(1)(1.1) of the Act are in violation of ss. 2(a) and (b), 7, 26 and 31 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and that these violations are not saved by s. 1 thereof. A violation of ss. 1(d) and (f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights is also alleged.\n[30] In the present Notice of Motion, Mr. Lemire alleges that the Commission has failed to disclose documents that are relevant and useful to the constitutional question raised. In particular, he is requesting that the Commission disclose documents regarding the Commission's activities as they relate to s. 13 of the Act.\n[31] Mr. Lemire points out that as part of the analysis of the constitutional question, the Tribunal may have to consider whether the alleged violation of the constitutional rights and freedoms invoked are justified pursuant to s. 1 of the Charter. He referred to the tests set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, and in particular, the proportionality test discussed at paragraphs 70 and 71 of the decision. The Court noted that as part of the analysis, one must balance the interests of society with those of individuals or groups. There must be a proportionality between the effects of the measures that limit the Charter right or freedom and the objective of the measures. The Court added that the inquiry into the effects is wide-ranging. It is possible that because of the severity of the deleterious effects of a measure on individuals or groups, the measure will not be justified by the purposes it intends to serve.\n[32] Mr. Lemire contends that the deleterious effects of s. 13 of the Act extend beyond the orders that the Tribunal may issue after adjudicating a complaint. He alleges that the Commission, in exercising its powers under the Act, has engaged in activities that have had the deleterious effect of restricting Charter rights and freedoms, outside the scope of the Tribunal hearing process. For instance, it is argued by Mr. Lemire that the Commission may have influenced Internet service providers (ISPs) in such a manner that the ISPs have removed websites that the Commission finds objectionable, without a human rights complaint ever having been filed against the website's operator.\n[33] In effect, the Commission would thereby achieve the result of having expressive material banned extrajudicially. This, it is argued, is a deleterious effect of s. 13, which must be explored as part of the proportionality test articulated in Oakes.\n[34] The Commission's position, in reply, is basically two-fold: first, that the request for documents is over-reaching and ambiguous - a matter that I will address separately below - and that the documents sought are not arguably relevant to the constitutional question. In my view, the Commission does not directly address the argument raised by Mr. Lemire. The Commission has not demonstrated how Mr. Lemire's submissions with respect to the relevance to the constitutional analysis are unfounded.\n[35] As I have already pointed out, according to Rule 6, documents that relate to an issue, whether raised by one party or another, must be disclosed. Mr. Lemire has raised the constitutionality of s. 13 as an issue in this case and as part of the analysis of this issue, the deleterious effects of s. 13 may need to be considered. This could include the manner in which these effects result in the violation of Charter rights and freedoms by means other than Tribunal orders following the adjudication of complaints. These effects relate to an issue identified by a party in this case and therefore, any document relating to these effects must be disclosed.\n[36] The Attorney General of Canada, in its submissions on this motion, raises a different argument than the Commission. The Attorney General contends that Mr. Lemire, in bringing up as an issue the manner in which the Commission discharges its mandate, is attempting to launch a Charter challenge against the Commission's interpretation and application of s. 13 of the Act, in fulfillment of its mandate under ss. 27 and 49(1). The only mechanism by which Mr. Lemire can accomplish this, it is argued, is by judicial review before the Federal Court or by an application\/action for a declaration in a provincial superior court.\n[37] Mr. Lemire replies that it is not a review of the lawfulness of the Commission's activities that he is seeking from the Tribunal. Rather, he is seeking a review of whether the deleterious effects of the legislation on freedom of speech outweigh the salutary effects.\n[38] In my view, both parties raise interesting points that can be properly submitted before the Tribunal adjudicating on the merits of the constitutional challenge and the complaint as a whole. At this stage, however, the question before me is very basic: do the documents being sought relate to an issue that has been raised by one of the parties to the case?\n[39] I accept Mr. Lemire's submission that there exists a nexus between the issue of the constitutionality of ss. 13 and 54(1)(1.1) of the Act, and any documents relating to any Commission activities that may affect the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Charter. The documents are therefore subject to disclosure, in accordance with Rule 6.\n[40] But this does not end the matter. The Commission contends that Mr. Lemire's requests for production are over-reaching and ambiguous. In my view, this assessment seems particularly applicable to the items requested under headings (h), (k) and (n), of Paragraph 37 of the Notice of Motion, which read as follows:\nh) All internal documents relating to hate and the Internet from 1993 (excluding documents filed in Tribunal proceedings under section 13 of the Act, transcripts of such proceedings or any internal solicitor correspondence related to such files);\nk) All documents relating to the genesis and procedures of the special anti-hate team set up to deal with complaints under section 13 including any guidelines for determining what is hate or contempt and staff training for determining what is hate within the meaning of s. 13;\nn) All documents concerning the Commission's activities in relation to hate on the Internet pursuant to section 27 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[41] As the Tribunal noted in the Bell Canada ruling, supra, at paras. 12-14, requests for disclosure that are over-reaching and lacking in specificity, amounting basically to the proverbial fishing expedition, will be denied.\n[42] In my view, items (h), (k), and (n) fall within this category. The requests are excessively broad in nature and encompass aspects of Commission activities that are not likely to relate to the issues of this dispute. For instance, it is not at all clear how documents relating to internal activities of the Commission can have a deleterious effect on Charter rights and freedoms of persons outside the Commission. It is only once the reach of a Commission activity extends outside the organization and affects a Charter right or freedom, that a document relating thereto becomes arguably relevant to the issue identified by Mr. Lemire.\n[43] On the other hand, I accept that the requests in items (j), (l) and (m) are arguably relevant and are not over-reaching or ambiguous:\nj) All documents relating to the Commission's relations with Internet Service Providers, including attempts to pressure ISPs to shut down websites or remove them;\nl) All documents relating to meetings, networking and consultation with any group representing one of the groups protected from discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and any police or governmental agencies, relating to hate on the Internet;\nm) All documents relating to educative or publicity activities of the Commission with respect to hate.\n[44] Mr. Lemire had initially requested the production of two other sets of documents (Items (i) and (o)), but it would appear from his subsequent correspondence with the Tribunal that he has obtained these documents from alternate sources. I assume therefore that these requests have been withdrawn.\n[45] To summarize, therefore, with respect to the second Notice of Motion, the Commission is ordered to disclose all documents in its possession relating to Items (j), (l) and (m) as hereinabove recited, and as listed in Paragraph 37 of the Mr. Lemire's Notice of Motion for the Production of Documents (Constitutional Issues), dated May 17, 2006.\n[46] A schedule for the disclosure of these documents can be established at an upcoming case management conference call.\nsigned by Athanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] The complainant, Catherine Hoyt, alleges that her employer, the Canadian National Railway Company (CN) failed to accommodate her pregnancy and also failed to accommodate her parental obligations. She contends that CN thereby discriminated against her on the basis of her sex and her family status, in breach of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act or CHRA.).\n[2] The complainant's union, the United Transportation Union (the Union), sought and received Interested Party status in the proceedings. In its statement of particulars, CN alleges that the Union did not act cooperatively or reasonably with respect to Ms. Hoyt's accommodation. The case managing member ruled that, in light of these allegations, the reputational interests of the Union might be affected by the within proceedings and that, accordingly, it was appropriate to grant the Union the status it sought and to direct that the Union would be allowed to introduce evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses and present argument on issues where its interests might be affected and on its involvement in the accommodation efforts.\n[3] The hearing extended 10 days in April of 2006 and included a site visit to the Walker Yard of the CN Edmonton Terminal. Both the complainant and the respondent participated at the hearing and were represented by legal counsel. The Union participated in the hearing and was represented by counsel. The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not participate.\n[4] For the reasons set out below, I have determined that CN did discriminate against Ms. Hoyt by failing to accommodate her pregnancy, and further that CN failed to accommodate her parental obligations. Ms. Hoyt's complaint has therefore been substantiated.\nII. BACKGROUND A. The Complainant [5] Ms. Hoyt is a third generation railroader. Both of her grandfathers, her father, two uncles and her brother enjoyed careers with CN. She is also married to a railroader.\n[6] In July of 1991, Ms. Hoyt was hired by CN. She worked first as a welder's helper in different regions of Ontario and in the spring of 1995 applied for and won a position at CN's Edmonton Terminal. Her family history had taught her that this would be a good career that would provide her and her family a good living, as it had other of her relatives.\n[7] A few months after Ms. Hoyt relocated she earned the position of a yard conductor in the Walker Yard of the Edmonton operation. Ms. Hoyt was a yard conductor at the time this complaint was filed.\nB. The Respondent [8] The respondent, CN, operates a railroad and is in the business of transporting goods across the country by rail.\n[9] The events relevant to the within complaint took place at CN's Edmonton Terminal. The Edmonton Terminal is comprised of the Walker Yard and three satellite yards, being the Bissell Yard, Cloverbar and the Scotford Yard. Approximately 100 employees work in the yards. Additionally, some of the administration of the Terminal was conducted at the time from the CN building in downtown Edmonton. Approximately 200 employees worked in the downtown administration building.\n[10] A brief description of the nature of this facility and some of CN's operations will be helpful to an understanding of the issues relevant to the within complaint.\n(i) The Walker Yard [11] At various points across the country the respondent has facilities that allow trains to be assembled and re-assembled as necessary. The Walker Yard is one such facility. The conductors in the Walker Yard marshal cars. Trains enter the Yard with cars on route to different locations. Perhaps 20 cars on a particular train must continue to the west coast, and another 30 to northern Alberta and so on. Trains must be disassembled and then reassembled so the cars can continue to their ultimate destination.\n[12] The procedure used to marshal cars is quite ingenious. The Walker Yard has a hump. The Hump is a hill with a very modest inclination. Trains are pushed up to the crest of this hill and the cars are disengaged either singly or in clusters as they are about to descend down the incline. At the bottom of the Hump are over forty separate tracks. The setting of rail switches allows each car or cluster of cars to be directed on to one or another track.\n[13] Once the cars have come to a stop on the track to which they have been directed the cars are then reassembled in advance of their departure. The reassembly is accomplished by yard conductors using yard locomotives to push the cars along the rails until the cars have been strung together in a proper order. Once the cars have been properly assembled they are ready to depart for the next leg of their journey.\n[14] The size of the operation in the Walker Yard is remarkable; the Yard and its tracks extend for several miles. The cars entering and then leaving the Yard weigh 30 tons when empty and can weigh 120 to 130 tons when full. Strings of rail cars entering or being made ready to leave the Yard are often a mile long. Every hour of the year cars are pushed along the many tracks of the Yard as they are marshaled into trains.\n[15] Safety is a paramount concern at CN, as was evidenced during our site visit. We were issued safety equipment and shepherded very carefully about the site on the tour. Safety is a part of the very design of railroad equipment. As an example, the braking system on trains employs air pressure. The air pressure is not, however, used to apply the brakes; it is used to release them. This design ensures that if air pressure is lost through a failure of the equipment, the train will stop. CN employees describe this as a `fail safe;' equipment is designed so that a failure will result in a safe rather than a dangerous situation.\n(ii) The Beltpack [16] One of the technical advances to be introduced at the Edmonton Yard is the beltpack or Locomotive Control Unit (L.C.U.). A beltpack allows a yard conductor to operate a locomotive like a remote control car. The unit, weighing about 6 pounds, is worn strapped to the body by a harness. It has switches, dials and toggles that allow the yard conductor to start, stop and control both the speed and direction of the locomotive. The beltpack is also equipped with a safety feature. If the beltpack is tipped beyond a 45 degree angle, the beltpack will stop the locomotive after a few seconds unless the unit is reset by the conductor. This is an emergency function designed to prevent injury, or further injury, should a conductor fall or become incapacitated while operating a locomotive. The beltpack is another example of fail safe design.\n[17] Prior to the implementation of beltpacks in or around 1995, crews of three people were used to marshal trains. One person, locomotive engineer, was placed in the locomotive itself while the other two would be on the ground at either end of the locomotive. The three communicated by radio. Three man crews were still used in the Walker Yard on occasion at the time relevant to this complaint. When the beltpacks were implemented, CN's general operating instructions directed that each of the two yard conductors would carry a pack and further that the conductor at the `leading end of the movement' was to be controlling the train. The leading end of the movement is the `front' of the train. When the train changes direction, the leading end switches from one end to the other. As the trains often change direction during the marshaling process, the conductors must alternate control between them as direction changes. This procedure is called `pitch and catch.' Upon the train changing direction, one yard conductor `pitches' control of the train to the other.\n[18] At the time relevant to this complaint, there was a disagreement at CN over whether it was safe for a two person yard conductor team to be deployed with only one conductor using a beltpack and the other using a two-way radio. The Union believed this would be unsafe. Management disagreed. Minutes of CN's Health and Safety Committee demonstrate that this disagreement was a live issue. CN's general operating instructions at the time required that on a two conductor crew, both conductors were to use beltpacks. The operating instructions also directed that, should one beltpack malfunction, the crew was to retrieve a new pack as soon as reasonably possible.\n(iii) CN's Seniority System - The Spare Board [19] The Respondent runs its operations around the clock. Trains are marshaled twenty-four hours per day, each day of the year. Shift work is a fact of life for a railroader and so is the unpredictability of one's schedule from day to day and from week to week.\n[20] The work schedules of yard employees at CN are determined by seniority. Employees with sufficient seniority may receive a regular assignment. These employees are advised each Friday of their schedules for the whole of the upcoming week. Even after receiving a regular assignment, however, an employee might be advised on short notice that his or her services are required in a position senior, or higher in CN's job hierarchy, to that of their regular assignment. These more senior positions, once offered, must be accepted by the employee.\n[21] Employees with less seniority have their schedules determined by the spare board. The spare board is a tool that allows the employer to appoint employees to required shifts and assignments. Employees are listed on this board in order of seniority and shifts are assigned in that order. More senior employees on the spare board receive more regular shifts at more favored times of the day and days of the week, while less senior employees receive less regular assignments at less favored times of the day and days of the week.\n[22] To secure a particular shift for an employee, or to allow an employee to avoid a particular shift, it will usually be necessary to exempt them from the unpredictable realities of the spare board. This status is called `super seniority.' The Union's consent is required before an employee can receive this status.\n(iv) CN's Accommodation Policy [23] CN has a policy in place for dealing with employees who require accommodation. Its Accommodation Guide for Managers and Supervisors identifies that (c)ourt decisions have required employers to provide accommodation to the extent that this does not create undue hardship and further, that (t)he costs incurred must be extremely high before the refusal to accommodate can be justified.\n[24] A document entitled Accommodation Checklist for Managers and Supervisors outlines the accommodation process to be engaged when accommodation is sought. The checklist directs the Manager or Supervisor to first meet with the employee in respect of the accommodation requirement; to identify the essential requirements of the employee's regular position; to consult with other representatives of CN as necessary and to consult with the Union; to then decide whether the employee's existing job function might be adjusted to accommodate or whether the employee might be assigned different job duties to accommodate his or her requirements or restrictions. Managers and Supervisors are directed to inform the employee of their decisions, to give reasons for those decisions, and to keep careful records of the steps taken in the accommodation process.\nIII. THE FACTS GIVING RISE TO THE COMPLAINT [25] In February of 2002, after 11 years of service with the respondent, Ms. Hoyt learned that she was pregnant. She began to experience some pain and discomfort on the job. She was examined by her doctor and the doctor wrote a letter to CN explaining that, as a result of her pregnancy, Ms. Hoyt required some modifications to her job. Ms. Hoyt, the doctor directed, must avoid hazards, avoid particularly strenuous activities and work regular hours. The doctor also directed that she was not to use a beltpack.\n[26] On February 18, 2002, Ms. Hoyt gave the doctor's letter to a CN Superintendent who advised her that she should go home on an unpaid leave of absence status until CN had time to consider the matter.\nA. CN's First Offer of Accommodation [27] On February 25, 2002 an Assistant Superintendent provided Ms. Hoyt with a letter detailing the accommodation that CN had designed. CN had proposed that she be placed on an afternoon shift as a yard conductor on the Walker Hump. This position would require Ms. Hoyt to wear a beltpack. In the letter CN asked for further clarification of her medical restrictions and concluded:\nAt this time are no modify (sic) duties where L.C.S. equipment is not involved. Based on all testing and technical reports the Company's position is that the L.C.S. equipment falls within all regulatory guidelines and does not pose health related problems.\nIf you feel you can not operated (sic) the L.C.S. equipment the Company will grant you a leave of absence without pay. At this time it is not reasonable practicable (sic) to modify your job function where the L.C.S. equipment is not used.\nThe reference to L.C.S. equipment is a reference to the beltpack.\n[28] Ms. Hoyt was distressed by this offer of accommodation. The Hump position, in her experience, was more rigorous than her regular yard conductor job. In that position a single yard conductor worked alone to disengage cars, singly or in clusters, before the cars began to descend down the track. The position was, in her view, difficult and relentless. The position also required the use of the beltpack. Her doctor had directed that she must not use the beltpack. She called her union. The Union had no knowledge of CN's accommodation proposal.\n[29] Ms. Hoyt re-attended at her doctor's office the next day. The doctor provided a more detailed letter explaining why the beltpack was not to be used:\nThe wearing of a beltpack will cause abdominal pressure and weight on the developing fetus. It will also contribute to backache as the pregnancy progresses. It is best then that the beltpack not be employed for the remainder of the pregnancy.\nMs. Hoyt provided this second letter to CN.\nB. CN's Second Offer of Accommodation [30] After receiving this second doctor's note, CN developed a second plan for accommodation and communicated this second proposal to the Union. CN proposed that Ms. Hoyt work in her former position of yard conductor, but that she would not wear a beltpack and would instead be supplied with a radio. Her co-worker would control the train in both directions. CN also proposed that she would work a regular afternoon shift, and so Ms. Hoyt would require super seniority status. The Union's consent would be required.\n[31] The Union reviewed this second proposal and expressed two concerns. The first concern was safety. As mentioned, the Union had long taken the position that it was dangerous to employ only one beltpack in a two conductor crew. The Union also expressed a concern about the super seniority status. It asked CN for an assurance that any employee who lost a shift as a result of this status being conferred on Ms. Hoyt be compensated. CN refused to give this assurance. The Union rejected this proposal primarily on the ground of safety and secondarily on the ground of seniority.\n[32] Ms. Hoyt shared the concerns expressed by the Union. She too felt that working as a yard conductor without a beltpack was unsafe. She was also concerned that, should CN place her in a position on the Yard outside her seniority status, she might suffer harassment on the work site. Ms. Hoyt testified that a female colleague of hers had received such an accommodation in the recent past. Ms. Hoyt heard and was required to defend her colleague from the disparaging comments of other workers as they complained that special treatment was being given to the women. Her colleague's car was vandalized during this time period. Ms. Hoyt was concerned that she now would be the target of these comments.\n[33] The Union proposed some other positions that might be used to accommodate Ms. Hoyt, including the following:\nplacing her in a `utility' position, being a general helper, on the Yard; placing her in a `utility' position on the Hump; having her drive a crew van on the Yard; assigning her to sedentary work in one of CN's administrative offices; assigning her to a three-man crew, which crews did not use beltpacks.\nEach of these proposals were rejected by CN.\n[34] On March 1, 2002, C.N. wrote to Ms. Hoyt:\nThe Company undertook an investigation of alternate duties or modifications to your existing duties due to your maternity related circumstances. The result of such investigation concluded that at this time the Company is unable to offer you accommodation.\nYour physical restrictions do fall within the parameters of the Assistant Conductor position at Walker yard west tower afternoon assignment, however your seniority does not allow you to hold same within your own right. In order to assign you to one of these positions, the company requires the agreement of the CCROU UTU.\nThe company discussed the accommodation with the union however they were not willing to enter an agreement that would override the seniority provisions of the collective agreement.\nThe company will continue looking for available opportunities that fall within your restrictions and advise you accordingly.\nIf you have any questions or require further information please contact the undersigned at . . .\nThe reference to the CCROU UTU is a reference to the Union.\n[35] Ms. Hoyt remained off work on unpaid leave. She did receive some sick benefits during the relevant time period.\n[36] Ms. Hoyt wrote to her employer by letter dated March 4, 2002 requesting information. She wanted to be advised of what positions CN had considered for her and who her contact person would be at the Company. She received no response to this request. Ms. Hoyt also filed a complaint with Human Resources Development Canada, alleging her employer violated its accommodation obligations under the Canada Labour Code, filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission and participated in the grievance process with her Union.\nC. CN's Third Offer - The Crew Van Position and Child Care [37] On May 25, 2002, after being on unpaid leave for three and a half months, the complainant was advised by CN that it had a position for her driving a crew van on the Walker Yard. She would work the afternoon shift from Tuesday through Saturday each week commencing Tuesday, May 28, 2002. Ms. Hoyt accepted the job immediately.\n[38] The Hoyts had a two-year old child at home. Before her pregnancy gave rise to her need for accommodation, Ms. Hoyt described that her schedule was quite variable. She worked off the spare board and received two-hour notice of her assignment to day, afternoon or midnight shifts. If her husband was at work, she would call friends and neighborhood teenagers to look after her daughter. The caregiver would attend at the Hoyt's home. Her daughter was never cared for outside her own home.\n[39] When she learned of her new schedule, Ms. Hoyt knew that she would have to arrange child care for her daughter. She also knew that she would require care for her daughter every Saturday as her husband's position at CN and his seniority status meant that he was required to work almost every Saturday.\n[40] Back in February of 2002, when she first learned she was pregnant and was advised by her doctor that she required accommodation, Ms. Hoyt assumed that she would receive a regular shift and would need to arrange child care. She contacted a woman in a nearby town who ran a home day care. This woman, married to a railroader, was familiar with the lives of families in that industry and was willing to accommodate their rather unusual child care needs, accepting children day or night, seven days a week. Ms. Hoyt secured a spot for her daughter at this facility. She was not accommodated promptly as she had expected. When she called this same facility in late May, she learned that they were no longer able to accept her daughter.\n[41] Ms. Hoyt contacted other people, mostly neighborhood teenagers, who had provided service to her in the past. She was, in the short period of time between May 25 and 28, able to secure child care for her daughter, except for three Saturdays in June.\n[42] When she returned to work on May 28, 2002, Ms. Hoyt advised CN of her child care problem. She asked as an accommodation that her schedule be altered so that she would not be required to work Saturdays for those three weeks. Assistant Supervisor, Rick Sherbo, advised her that he would see what he could do.\n[43] On June 4, 2002, Ms. Hoyt went back to Mr. Sherbo's office to see what arrangement had been put in place. She was advised that CN would accommodate her by allowing her to take unpaid leave for those days.\n[44] Ms. Hoyt became upset. She had a verbal altercation with Mr. Sherbo before her shift was scheduled to start. Upon leaving his office she realized that she was unfit to work. She was very upset and felt unable to safely drive the crew van. She left work and while driving home started experiencing shortness of breath and some physical pain in her abdomen. She was worried about her own health and the health of her fetus. She had experienced medical difficulties during her first pregnancy. She drove directly to the hospital. She was observed, undertook some tests and was discharged the same day. The next day she attended at her doctor and was advised that the stress she was continuing to experience around the accommodation of her pregnancy was endangering her health and might harm her fetus. She was directed to stay off work for a month.\n[45] Ms. Hoyt remained at home as directed. Her application for Worker's Compensation Benefits was contested by CN and was unsuccessful. She received some sick benefits.\n[46] In early July of 2002, Ms. Hoyt returned to work driving the utility van and continued to carry out that function until she left on maternity leave. Her second child was born in the fall of that year.\nIV. ANALYSIS [47] Section 7 of the CHRA identifies that it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ or to continue to employ an individual, and to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[48] The onus is first on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Upon the complainant discharging this onus, the evidentiary burden shifts to the respondent to establish that the measure adopted or decision made was based on a bona fide occupational requirement and that accommodation would impose undue hardship (section 15(1)(a) and 15(2), CHRA).\nA. Has the Complainant Demonstrated a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination on the Basis of Sex? [49] A prima facie case of discrimination is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favor, in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.(O'Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd. [1985], 2 S.C.R. 536 at para 28).\n[50] Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is discrimination on the basis of sex (see section 3(2) of the CHRA and Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd. [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219).\n[51] I find on the evidence of the complainant that a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of sex has been made out. In particular, the complainant's evidence demonstrates that CN refused to continue to employ her and that CN differentiated adversely in relation to her on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(i) Refusal to Employ or to Continue to Employ [52] Ms. Hoyt became pregnant. She began experiencing some pain and discomfort at work. She went to her doctor. Her doctor examined her and in a letter made four clear and simple directions. She brought the letter to CN. She was told to go home and was placed on unpaid leave status.\n[53] CN made two offers of accommodation to Ms. Hoyt in February of 2002. Ms. Hoyt rejected the first proposal and the Union, with her support, rejected the second.\n[54] The accommodation proposals made by CN engage the Supreme Court of Canada's analysis in Renaud [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970 at para. 39 and reminds us that where an employer has communicated a proposal that would fully accommodate an employee's needs or restrictions and that is reasonable in the circumstances, the employer's duty is satisfied. It then becomes the duty of the employee and, in a collective bargaining environment, the duty of the Union, to accept and to facilitate the implementation of the proposal. If an employee's need for accommodation is fully and properly satisfied, the employer will not be required to demonstrate that the accommodation amounted to undue hardship.\n[55] The Federal Court of Appeal has also considered this issue. Pelletier JA writing per curiam in Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of Environment), [2003] 4 F.C. 580 at para. 75, noted that where the conduct of an employer can be demonstrated to have taken reasonable steps and to have made reasonable proposals that would meet an employee's limitations, the employee has not been adversely treated and a prima facie case will not be made out.\n[56] I find that neither of CN's proposals accommodated Ms. Hoyt's requirements.\n[57] CN's first accommodation proposal was directly contrary to at least one of the medical restrictions identified by her doctor. She was told by her doctor not to use a belt pack. The position required the use of the beltpack. Ms. Hoyt also believed that the position would be unduly strenuous and so in violation of a second of her doctor's directions. This offer was not of a nature contemplated by Renaud; it did not accommodate the restrictions identified by her doctor.\n[58] CN's second accommodation proposal also failed to accommodate Ms. Hoyt. While this proposal, if implemented, would have met each of the restrictions identified by Ms. Hoyt's doctor, the proposal gave rise to other significant concerns: safety and seniority.\n[59] The Union took the position that this proposal would make Ms. Hoyt unsafe on the Yard. Ms. Hoyt, an experienced yard conductor, shared that concern. CN's general operating instructions required both conductors wear a beltpack when employed on a two conductor crew. CN's proposal would exempt Ms. Hoyt alone from this workplace direction. As mentioned previously, safety is a priority at CN. Safety measures are a part of the equipment and part of the culture of this industry. The safety concern was reasonable in the circumstances and represented another of Ms. Hoyt's needs for accommodation. The position offered did not meet this need and so did not fully meet Ms. Hoyt's requirement for accommodation.\n[60] Discrimination can arise from both conduct that creates practical disadvantage and from the messages that such conduct can convey (Vriend v. Alberta [1998] 1 S.C.R. 493 at para. 100). The message conveyed by this proposal is palpable. If implemented, the proposal would mean that Ms. Hoyt - only Ms. Hoyt - only the pregnant woman - would be navigating the Walker Yard, among its 40 tracks, the moving rail cars weighing 30 to 130 tons and stretching as much as a mile long, without the equipment, the protection, that the general operating instructions afford every other employee on a two conductor crew. The message that the implementation of this proposal would send is prima facie discriminatory.\n[61] This proposal also created for Ms. Hoyt a reasonable apprehension that she would be exposed to further discrimination should she be given super seniority status. This concern was based on the recent experience of a colleague, who suffered inappropriate comments from co-workers and other mischief. This concern of Ms. Hoyt's was another element of her need for accommodation and CN's second proposal did not meet this need.\n[62] Having rejected the offers of accommodation, Ms. Hoyt remained on unpaid leave for three and a half months. Ms. Hoyt was not sick. She was not injured. She was a healthy woman in the early stages of pregnancy. I find that the prima facie case is made out. Between mid February and late May of 2002 the complainant was a victim of discrimination because her pregnancy was not properly accommodated.\n(ii) Differentiating Adversely [63] There is also evidence that Ms. Hoyt was treated differently and adversely compared to other employees not sharing her personal characteristic of pregnancy.\n[64] Marvin Sawatzky gave evidence at the hearing. Mr. Sawatzky, a CN conductor and locomotive engineer, injured his ankle three days before Ms. Hoyt made her request for accommodation. Mr. Sawatzky got a note from his doctor, took it to CN and was told to come in the next day. He first worked in the administration office and was later given a position driving a crew van. His shift was Monday to Friday commencing at 7:30 a.m. While Mr. Sawatzky was paid for the full shift, he left the work site after lunch each day to attend physiotherapy. He went home after his appointment. Mr. Sawatzky returned to his regular assignment in early May.\n[65] Ms. Hoyt's husband, who worked as a conductor at CN among other positions he performed for this employer, became unable to use the beltpack nine days after Ms. Hoyt's need for accommodation arose. A problem with the pack's harness was causing Mr. Hoyt to experience back pain. Like Mr. Sawatzky, Mr. Hoyt delivered a doctor's note to CN outlining his requirement for accommodation. He was told to come in the next morning. Mr. Hoyt joined Mr. Swatzky in an administration office on the yard doing administrative work. He was later re-assigned to a point protection position that entailed his operating a locomotive on a three-person crew. Three-person crews do not use beltpacks. He returned to his regular assignment in early April 2002 after CN had successfully made adjustments to his harness. Mr. Hoyt was not assigned to a two- conductor crew with a radio instead of a beltpack.\n[66] CN could not, however, find accommodation for Ms. Hoyt beyond the proposals made. She sat at home.\n[67] This differential treatment itself makes out a prima facie case of discrimination (Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Odeon Theatres Ltd. (1985), 6 C.H.R.R. D\/2682 at D\/2689). CN's failure to afford reasonable accommodation to Ms. Hoyt between mid-February and late May, 2002, particularly when other employees were accommodated seamlessly, is sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case of discrimination. The onus now shifts to CN to justify its conduct on a balance of probabilities.\nB. CN's Justification [68] CN's justification is that it had made a reasonable proposal of accommodation that met its legal duty to accommodate and that Ms. Hoyt and the Union failed to discharge their duty to accept the reasonable accommodation. The Union was further at fault because it did not communicate its rejection of the proposal until late April, 2002. Finally, there were no other positions at CN that could be offered to Ms. Hoyt until the crew van driver position became available. CN's evidence on the issue of justification is as follows.\n[69] CN's objectives when it attended to Ms. Hoyt's request for accommodation were twofold. First, they preferred to keep employees engaged in their craft as much as that was possible. Second, they preferred to engage employees only in viable accommodative positions, meaning positions valuable to CN's operations.\n[70] When the complainant's request for accommodation and doctor's note were first received, CN assistant supervisor, Rick Sherbo, made some inquiries of other CN departments to see if they had anything available for `a pregnant woman.' He found nothing. CN was downsizing its administrative positions at the time and CN had recently eliminated some positions created to accommodate employees as the positions had been found to be of no value to the company.\n[71] Mr. Sherbo shared the doctor's note with his superior, Mr. Valliere. They were of the opinion that beltpack use posed no medical concerns to a pregnant woman. The two were also unclear about the restrictions regarding hazards and overly arduous activities. They decided to offer Ms. Hoyt a beltpack position on the Walker Hump. They felt this position to be less strenuous than a position on the yard. They also decided to ask for clarification from Ms. Hoyt's doctor regarding her restrictions. This position would satisfy CN's objectives in accommodation.\n[72] Upon receiving the second doctor's note, Mr. Sherbo and Mr. Valliere discussed the matter again. The second position, that Ms. Hoyt would work on a two-conductor crew without a beltpack, was settled on as it would meet CN's accommodation objectives and satisfy the restrictions identified by the doctor. `This is basically what we came up with as viable accommodation,' testified Mr. Sherbo. CN took this proposal to the Union. The Union, as we know, rejected the proposal.\n[73] Mr. Sherbo then wrote the March 1, 2002, letter to Ms. Hoyt advising her that the Union had rejected their proposal of accommodation and that there were no other positions available at CN to accommodate Ms. Hoyt's pregnancy.\n[74] The alternative solutions proposed by the Union were dismissed because in CN's view they were `not viable.'\n[75] Mr. Sherbo said that he continued, from time to time, to make inquiries about available positions. He found none. He also advised that after March 1, 2002, the matter `went upstairs.' He was unaware of decisions made or CN's reasoning behind decisions made after that date.\n[76] In mid-March, 2002, a month after Ms. Hoyt made her first request for accommodation and a month after she had been sent home on unpaid leave, Susan Blackmore, a CN human resources officer, became involved in the file. CN asked Ms. Blackmore to try to convince the Union to change its mind and to consent to the second proposal of accommodation. CN felt the accommodation was a `good and viable' solution. She spoke to a union representative and followed up with correspondence asking for a response. Ms. Blackmore testified that she was hopeful that the Union would change its position and that while she awaited a response she made a few informal inquiries of other departments to see if there were any positions available. She found no position for Ms. Hoyt. Ms. Blackmore described that `at CN there are limited opportunities to accommodate.' At the end of April, the Union presented a formal policy grievance on Ms. Hoyt's behalf. It was only then, she testified, that she realized that the Union would not change its position.\n[77] At the end of May 2002, Ms. Hoyt was offered the crew van position. CN's witnesses did not know when and how the crew van position became available. That decision was made by Mr. Valliere. He was not called as a witness.\nC. Was CN's Conduct Justified? Was it a BFOR? [78] Section 15 of the CHRA directs that where an employer's conduct is based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR), the conduct will not be a discriminatory practice.\n[79] To meet its evidentiary burden, an employer must demonstrate that it discharged its duty of reasonable accommodation short of undue hardship (Ontario v. Simpson Sears [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, see also Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) (1990) 12 C.H.R.R. D\/417).\n[80] The Supreme Court of Canada decision in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union (B.C.G.S.E.U.) (Meiorin Grievance) [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin), sets out the content of an employer's duty to accommodate and the analysis by which an employer's efforts must be assessed.\n[81] To establish this justification, that is, a BFOR, the employer must prove:\nthat the standard was adopted or a decision made for a purpose rationally connected to a legitimate work related purpose (Meiorin, supra at para. 58); that the standard adopted or the decision was made in an honest and good faith belief it was necessary to fulfill this work related-purpose (Meiorin, supra at para. 60); that the standard adopted or decision made was on the evidence reasonably necessary to accomplish this work related purpose (Meiorin, supra at para. 62).\n(i) Rational Connection [82] To satisfy the first arm of the test in Meiorin, the employer must demonstrate that a decision made is rationally connected to a work-related purpose. The focus in this first step is not the validity of the particular decisions made, but rather the validity of the more general purpose.\n[83] The decisions made by CN in its attempts to accommodate Ms. Hoyt were, first, to send her home on unpaid leave until they considered the doctor's note; next to offer her a position on the Walker Hump; and next to offer her a position as a conductor on the yard without wearing a beltpack. CN could find no other positions to accommodate Ms. Hoyt until late May, 2002.\n[84] CN gave two reasons for the decisions made regarding Ms. Hoyt's accommodation. CN preferred to keep employees working in their craft where that was reasonably possible. CN also preferred to have employees working in jobs that were viable, meaning valuable to its operations.\n[85] I find these general overall purposes, being a desire to maintain employees in their craft, and that of economic viability, to be reasonable, and the decisions rationally connected to CN's stated objectives.\n(ii) Honest and Good Faith Belief [86] Step two of the Meiorin test is the subjective element of the test. The employer must demonstrate that it adopted a particular standard with an honest and good faith belief that the decision was necessary to accomplish its objective. The employer must also demonstrate that it had no intention of discriminating against the claimant.' (Meiorin, supra, at para. 60).\n[87] I find that CN has not discharged its onus at this second step of the analysis.\n[88] CN is a large and sophisticated employer. CN has both a Risk Management and a Human Resources Department with many employees engaged on a daily basis with matters of accommodation. Human Resources employees represent their employer in arbitrations of workplace grievances, respond to complaints made by employees under the Canada Labour Code and complaints filed under the CHRA. CN has ample resources and it is appropriate to deem that this employer understands the content of its duty to accommodate as that duty has been prescribed under the Act and articulated by this Tribunal and our courts.\n[89] CN has accommodation policies that set out a reasonable, if superficial, articulation of the content of the duty to accommodate and sets out the processes to be employed by CN supervisors and managers when considering accommodation requests. CN failed to follow much of its own accommodation policy when dealing with Ms. Hoyt's request for accommodation.\n[90] In all of the circumstances I find that CN did not believe or was reckless to believe that its decision was reasonably necessary and did not believe, or was reckless to believe that it was not discriminating against Ms. Hoyt in its accommodation efforts.\n[91] As identified earlier in these reasons, the offers of accommodation made to Ms. Hoyt did not meet her need for accommodation. Further, as I will explain in more detail below, CN's efforts to accommodate Ms. Hoyt fell woefully short of meeting its duty to accommodate her as that duty is explored below and failed to properly follow its own accommodation policy. CN knew or ought to have known that it was engaging in a discriminatory practice. CN fails this second arm of the test.\n(iii) Reasonable Necessity [92] The third step of the Meiorin test requires the employer to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the decision, or decisions, made are reasonably necessary to accomplish its work-related objectives. The decision will be reasonably necessary if the employer is able to demonstrate that it cannot accommodate an employee without experiencing undue hardship (Meiorin, supra, at para. 62, see also Hutchinson, supra, at para. 70 and Audet v. CN, 2006, CHRT 25, at para. 50).\n[93] CN made two proposals of accommodation which would serve its objectives of keeping Ms. Hoyt in her craft and ensuring she worked a position that was valuable to CN's operations. I found earlier that neither of these proposals met Ms. Hoyt's reasonable needs for accommodation. The first did not meet the medical restrictions enumerated by her doctor. The second gave rise to significant safety concerns and a concern that a super seniority status would cause Ms. Hoyt to suffer further discrimination. The Union also reasonably rejected this proposal.\n[94] CN concluded that it could offer no other position to Ms. Hoyt and that she would remain home on unpaid leave. Was this decision reasonably necessary in the sense contemplated in Meiorin? I find that it was not.\n[95] We are directed in this third arm of the test, to look first at the process or procedures adopted to assess the issue of accommodation, and second, to look at the substantive content of the decision made (Meiorin, supra, at para. 66).\n[96] An employer must demonstrate that the process or procedures adopted to assess the issue of accommodation were appropriate. An employer must be sensitive to and respectful of the skills, capabilities and potential contributions of employees requiring accommodation (Meiorin, supra, at para. 64 see also Audet, supra, at para. 51); an employer must investigate alternative approaches to accommodation that might be less discriminatory, and demonstrate that any alternative approach considered was rejected only for appropriate reasons (Meiorin, supra, at para. 65 see also Audet, supra, at para. 62); an employer must be innovative and practical in assessing accommodation issues. I find that CN did not meet these process requirements.\n[97] I find that CN was not sensitive to or respectful of Ms. Hoyt's skills, capabilities and potential contributions. CN did not take steps to discover Ms. Hoyt's actual skills and abilities. CN did not even meet with Ms. Hoyt in any meaningful way during this time period, even though its own accommodation policy directs that the employee be met with as a first step in the process. CN prepared no detailed profile of Ms. Hoyt's skills and abilities to assist CN in its canvass. Ms. Hoyt was a healthy woman with a lot to give her employer. We know she had welding experience and, as a long time employee of CN, much knowledge of its operations. What other skills and capabilities might she have? This step of information gathering is crucial to the accommodation process and this step was ignored by CN. Without a true appreciation of who Ms. Hoyt was and what she could do to help the company, it is unlikely that an employer will be able to properly attend to other of its procedural obligations.\n[98] I find that CN failed to demonstrate that it had carefully considered any alternative approaches to the accommodation of Ms. Hoyt. CN did not demonstrate that it had itself generated and considered any alternatives to the proposals made. This is notwithstanding the directions in its own accommodation policy that inquiries be made, alternatives considered carefully and that records be kept of every step of the process. There were no records introduced in evidence. Further, CN dismissed the proposals submitted by the Union. At least some of the positions proposed would have kept Ms. Hoyt in her craft or a position fairly closely related to her craft and so would have met CN's first objective in accommodation. The reason CN dismissed these proposals was that they were, in its view, not viable. CN led no evidence that it made careful consideration of each of these proposals, or that it considered carefully the costs of implementing any of these proposals, or evidence that the cost would be undue. CN did not demonstrate that its rejection of the Union's proposals was based on appropriate considerations.\n[99] CN's efforts to accommodate Ms. Hoyt, beyond making the two proposals discussed earlier, was limited to telephone inquiries. Contrary to the direction in CN's accommodation policy, no records were kept of these inquiries and so we are unable to know the breadth, depth and persistence of this search. Ms. Blackmore testified that she made telephone inquiries of other departments after she became involved in the matter in mid-March of 2002. Mr. Sherbo's evidence was that he too phoned various CN departments looking for accommodation for an employee `who was pregnant.' He would also make these inquiries in person on some occasions. This type of informal canvass falls far short of the obligation identified in Meiorin. It is also demeaning to Ms. Hoyt and underscores the importance of the prior step of information gathering and its critical relation to the preservation of her human dignity.\n[100] With these telephone inquiries CN was looking for available positions, meaning job vacancies, taking the position that if there were no vacancies, CN was unable to offer accommodation to an employee.\n[101] While this very narrow approach to a search for accommodative positions would meet CN's work-related objective of viability, it does not, without more, meet its duty to accommodate. McLachlin J. observes in Meiorin that . . . it may be ideal from the employer's perspective to choose a standard that is uncompromisingly stringent. She goes on to describe, however, that for a standard to be justifiable under human rights legislation, (it) must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship (Meiorin, supra, at para. 62). CN did not demonstrate that this narrow approach to accommodation was the best it could do short of undue hardship.\n[102] Employers must be innovative in their search to accommodate an employee. They must be flexible and creative. CN did not demonstrate adequate innovation, flexibility or creativity.\n[103] I find the decision in Saunders v. Kentville (Town) [2004] N.S.H.R.B.I.D. No. 9, to be instructive. In that case, a Nova Scotia Board of Inquiry considered the complaint of a police officer alleging that she was not accommodated by her detachment because of her sex\/pregnancy. Chair Deveau employed a Meiorin analysis in the context of a small police force in Nova Scotia. The Chair found that even in this small force of 12 to 14 officers, and even where accommodation would be awkward and inconvenient, the employer failed to discharge its duty to accommodate as it made little effort to assemble a number of duties and functions on a temporary basis in searching for ways of accommodating the claimant. The employer, he found, had a duty to fully and completely explore opportunities for light duties to the point of undue hardship. The employer had not proven that it had done that.\n[104] CN is a much larger operation. CN had approximately 100 employees working in the yards of the Edmonton Terminal at the relevant time and another 200 or so employees working in the downtown administration building. With so many job functions being carried out at the Edmonton Terminal, surely an employer who is properly innovative and flexible could attempt to create, modify or re-package one or more of these job functions to accommodate Ms. Hoyt in a manner that met its work-related objectives. CN led no evidence that it had engaged in this type of inquiry.\n[105] Moving beyond the process employed by CN in considering its accommodation of Ms. Hoyt and viewing the substance of the decisions made, it is clear that CN failed to demonstrate that its decisions were justified in the manner contemplated by Meiorin. CN led no evidence to suggest that it would suffer undue hardship by extending to Ms. Hoyt an alternative position as accommodation. As this Tribunal has recently observed, an employer must demonstrate undue hardship `in real, concrete terms' (Audet, supra, at para. 106). I find that CN has not demonstrated that on receiving Ms. Hoyt's first request for accommodation it was impossible to find her a position the next day, as it did for Mr. Sawatzky and Mr. Hoyt.\n[106] CN has failed to discharge its evidentiary burden under section 15(1)(a) of the CHRA; it has not demonstrated that it would be impossible for it to accommodate Ms. Hoyt's pregnancy without suffering undue hardship.\nD. Did the Union Obstruct CN's Attempts to Accommodate Ms. Hoyt? [107] CN alleged in their statement of particulars that the Union obstructed its attempts to accommodate Ms. Hoyt. First, the Union refused its consent to the two-conductor\/one beltpack position. Second, the Union did not communicate its position until April of 2002 and, as a result, Ms. Hoyt's accommodation was delayed.\n[108] I find that the Union did not obstruct the accommodation efforts. First, the Union did not act improperly in rejecting CN's proposed accommodation. I noted earlier that the safety and seniority concerns expressed by the Union and shared by Ms. Hoyt were elements of her reasonable need for accommodation. In these circumstances, the Union's rejection of CN's proposed accommodation was not improper. Further, the Union's duty to facilitate accommodation arises only when its involvement is required to make accommodation policy and no other reasonable alternative resolution of the matter has been found or could reasonably have been found (Renaud, supra, at para. 50). I found earlier that CN had failed to demonstrate that there were no alternative positions that Ms. Hoyt could have been offered.\n[109] I find further on the evidence that the Union did not obstruct CN's accommodation attempt by reason of delay in communicating its position to CN. The Union reasonably rejected CN's second offer of accommodation immediately and repeatedly. The Union, through different of its officers, rejected CN's proposal on February 26, February 28 and March 1, 2002. The Union made several proposals of alternate positions that might be offered to Ms. Hoyt. Each of the Union's proposals were rejected by CN. No further action was taken by CN to accommodate Ms. Hoyt until late May, 2002. I have earlier found that CN has failed to demonstrate that it could not have accommodated Ms. Hoyt promptly. She should have been back to work.\n[110] Approximately a month after Ms. Hoyt had first asked for accommodation, CN engaged Ms. Blackmore to try to convince the Union to change its mind. Ms. Blackmore testified that she understood that the Union was considering her request and that she hoped the Union would change its mind. Ms. Blackmore and CN waited. Ms. Hoyt remained at home.\n[111] The Union's evidence was that its position that it was unsafe for a two-conductor crew to be deployed with only one beltpack was a position of very long standing and, further, that it had never considered changing its position in relation to Ms. Hoyt's proposed accommodation. The Union's evidence is that the delay in responding to Ms. Blackmore's inquiries is that it was searching for more information before finalizing its grievance.\n[112] CN argues that the Union's delay in responding to Ms. Blackmore's request that it reconsider its position, created or contributed to the delay in accommodating Ms. Hoyt.\n[113] CN's evidence that it thought the Union could be convinced to change its position and was in fact considering such a change in position regarding Ms. Hoyt's accommodation seems somewhat disingenuous given the history of the matter. The Union had long disagreed with this proposed position. Further, Union officers clearly rejected the proposal three times between February 26 and March 1, 2002.\n[114] It is not necessary for me to find whether CN did or did not have a bona fide belief that the Union was considering changing its position between mid March and late April. I have found that this proposal was neither reasonable nor reasonably necessary. I have further found that CN knew or ought to have known this. Ms. Hoyt should have received accommodation well before Ms. Blackmore became involved in mid-March, more than a month after Ms. Hoyt was placed on unpaid leave.\n[115] I find that the Union did not interfere with CN's accommodation efforts.\nE. Has the Complainant Demonstrated a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination on the Basis of Family Status? [116] It is a discriminatory practice under the CHRA to `differentiate adversely in relation to any individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination (section 7(b)).' Ms. Hoyt alleges that in addition to suffering discrimination on the basis of sex, she suffered discrimination on the basis of her family status.\n[117] Discrimination on this ground has been judicially defined as `. . . practices or attitudes which have the effect of limiting the conditions of employment of, or the employment opportunities available to, employees on the basis of a characteristic relating to their . . . family.' (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Mr. A et al [2000] O.J. No. 4275 (C.A.); affirmed [2002] S.C.J. No. 67].\n[118] This Tribunal has considered the evidentiary requirements to establish a prima facie case in a decision that predates the Ontario case, though is clearly consistent with its definition:\n. . . the evidence must demonstrate that family status includes the status of being a parent and includes the duties and obligations as a member of society and further that the Complainant was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with an employer rule, the Complainant was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with her employer (Brown v. Canada (Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise) [1993] C.H.R.D. No. 7, at p. 13). (See also Woiden et al v. Dan Lynn T.D. 09\/02)\n[119] A different articulation of the evidence necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case is articulated by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Health Sciences Assn. of British Columbia v. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, [2004] B.C.J. No. 922. The Court of Appeal found that the parameters of family status as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Human Rights Code of British Columbia must not be drawn too broadly or it would have the potential to cause `disruption and great mischief' in the workplace. The Court directed that a prima facie case is made out when a change in a term or condition of employment imposed by an employer results in serious interference with a substantial parental or other family duty or obligation of the employee. Low, J.A. observed that the prima facie case would be difficult to make out in cases of conflict between work requirements and family obligations.\n[120] With respect, I do not agree with the Court's analysis. Human rights codes, because of their status as `fundamental law,' must be interpreted liberally so that they may better fulfill their objectives (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at p. 547, Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at pp. 1134-1136; Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board) [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at pp. 89-90). It would, in my view, be inappropriate to select out one prohibited ground of discrimination for a more restrictive definition.\n[121] In my respectful opinion, the concerns identified by the Court of Appeal, being serious workplace disruption and great mischief, might be proper matters for consideration in the Meiorin analysis and in particular the third branch of the analysis, being reasonable necessity. When evaluating the magnitude of hardship, an accommodation might give rise to matters such as serious disruption in the workplace, and serious impact on employee morale are appropriate considerations (see Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) 1990 2 S.C.R. 489 at pp. 520 - 521). Undue hardship is to be proven by the employer on a case by case basis. A mere apprehension that undue hardship would result is not a proper reason, in my respectful opinion, to obviate the analysis.\n[122] The evidence particularly relevant to this component of the complaint arises when Ms. Hoyt was given the position of crew van driver in late May, 2002. These facts however are part of the larger story and do not represent a discrete and separate complaint. To receive a proper apprehension of the family status component of this complaint, we must view the facts relevant to this second allegation as part of a continuous transaction between Ms. Hoyt and CN around the issue of her previous request for accommodation.\n[123] Ms. Hoyt had secured day care for her daughter in February, anticipating that CN would accommodate promptly the restrictions identified by her doctor. She found a facility that could accommodate the unusual requirements of railroad families. CN did not accommodate her promptly. When CN did finally call on May 25 directing that she report to work on May 28, Ms. Hoyt called that day care facility and learned that there were no longer any spaces available. She called other sitters she had engaged in the past, being mostly neighborhood teenagers. These teenagers were not available as they were in school during the week until the end of June. In the three days' notice provided by CN, she was able to make arrangements for her daughter's care, except for three Saturdays in June.\n[124] When asked why she had not made a more systematic search for a day care placement, Ms. Hoyt described that it would be difficult to find a facility open on Saturdays or open as late as she would require, given that she was assigned an afternoon shift which would require, her to work from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Further, she described that even if she could find a facility, it would not be possible for her to properly check out the agencies or to take the time to acquaint herself and her daughter with the facility. Her two-year old daughter, as mentioned earlier, had never been cared for outside her own home and Ms. Hoyt did not want to put her abruptly in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people.\n[125] When she asked for an accommodation, and in particular asked that she work a shift that would allow her to avoid Saturdays for those three weeks, CN rejected the proposal. CN advised that it would allow her to take unpaid leave for these three Saturdays.\n[126] CN appears to deny that Ms. Hoyt was adversely treated. It was CN policy to assist parents facing circumstances that left them without child care. Rather than discipline an employee for missing a shift for this reason, CN would allow the employee time off without pay for a few shifts to allow them to make necessary arrangements. CN was treating Ms. Hoyt the same as they treated all other employees with child care concerns. The fact that CN treated Ms. Hoyt the same way that it treated other employees who had child care concerns does not mean that Ms. Hoyt was not adversely treated.\n[127] CN had failed to accommodate Ms. Hoyt for three and a half months. She was left home on an unpaid leave of absence. By the time CN finally did make the crew van position available, Ms. Hoyt had lost the day care arrangement she had put in place earlier. She was unable to secure alternate care for three weeks. She was offered yet more unpaid leave of absence. In these circumstances, I find that it was prima facie discriminatory for CN not to accommodate the modest requirement arising from its wrongful prior conduct.\n[128] One is also struck by the difference in treatment extended to Mr. Sawatzky, the employee who drove the crew van before her. He drove the van Mondays to Fridays. Mr. Sawatzky also left early to attend at physiotherapy every day and was paid for those attendances. His needs were met with abundance. Why were Ms. Hoyt's needs for accommodation not met?\n[129] I find that the prima facie case has been made out. Ms. Hoyt demonstrated on the evidence that she was a parent and that she was incurring the duties and obligations of parenthood. Ms. Hoyt made an attempt to secure, in a very short period of time, good quality child care that would not cause undue distress to her young daughter. She was largely successful and was left with a need to be accommodated for three days. CN's direction that she could stay home those Saturdays, but that she would not be paid, meant that she was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with her employer.\nF. CN's Justification [130] CN's justification for denying Ms. Hoyt's request that she work Monday to Friday for three weeks in June was that Superintendent Valliere had done some research and determined that the Tuesday to Saturday shift was the most viable shift to CN as cabs were particularly busy on Friday and Saturday and so were more often late to pick up crew members. Late crews cost money.\nG. Was CN's Conduct Justified? Was the Conduct a BFOR? [131] Turning to the section 15(1)(a) analysis as enunciated in Meiorin, I find the first two arms of the test are made out by CN. First, the decision to create a Tuesday to Saturday shift was rationally connected to CN's work-related objective of productivity. Mr. Valliere determined that the Tuesday to Saturday shift was the crew van shift that would provide the most value to CN. Second, I find that the decision was made in the good faith belief that it was necessary to achieve this objective and that there was no discriminatory animus.\n[132] I find however that the employer has not discharged its onus under the third arm of the test. No evidence was led that CN would have suffered undue hardship had it adjusted Ms. Hoyt's schedule. Ms. Hoyt would, for three weeks, be working a Sunday or a Monday, days when a crew van was not as valuable to CN. Alternatively, CN would have incurred the cost of engaging another employee to drive the crew van on Saturdays or to direct that the employees requiring transportation call a taxi, as CN did when there were no crew vans in operation. CN led no evidence of the costs involved and has not demonstrated that undue hardship would have been incurred. I find that CN has not discharged its onus in this regard.\nH. Finding of Discrimination [133] For all these reasons, I find that Ms. Hoyt suffered discrimination on the basis of her sex and her family status in breach of section 7 of the CHRA by reason that the respondent failed to accommodate her, and that CN has not established that its failure to accommodate Ms. Hoyt's sex and her family status was justified based on a bona fide occupational requirement, pursuant to section 15 of the CHRA. Ms. Hoyt's complaint has therefore been substantiated.\nV. WHAT REMEDIES ARE SOUGHT? A. By the Complainant (i) An Order that CN Review its Accommodation Policy [134] Ms. Hoyt requests an order, pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA, that CN take measures in consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, to redress its failure to properly accommodate its employees.\n[135] I heard evidence during the hearing about CN's history of accommodating employees. CN's evidence identified some `success stories' and the Union's evidence and the evidence of Ms. Hoyt identified some less successful stories. I was provided with grievance arbitration decisions but heard from no employees other than Ms. Hoyt about their experiences when in need of accommodation. I was urged by counsel for the complainant to make a finding of systemic discrimination at CN and to grant the remedy requested on the basis of that conclusion. I find, however, that the evidence before the Tribunal was not of a quality adequate for me to draw any conclusions that there are systemic problems with CN's accommodation processes, or to order a remedy based on such a finding.\n[136] I do, however, find that the order requested by the complainant should be granted. First, while CN has an accommodation policy, it was not followed. The policy contemplates a careful and consultative relationship between CN and its employees in need of accommodation. CN is first to meet with the employee, to discover what their needs are, to consider options, to document all steps taken and to disclose to the employee the steps taken and the reasons for decisions made. The evidence is clear that CN did not follow these directions when considering Ms. Hoyt's accommodation.\n[137] The evidence also demonstrates that CN, through its employees charged with facilitating accommodation, adopted an approach to Ms. Hoyt's accommodation that falls alarmingly short of its duty to accommodate. I am satisfied that the CN accommodation policy does not articulate with sufficient clarity the content of an employer's duty to accommodate and the process directives made in Meiorin. I am also convinced that CN has failed to take the steps necessary to ensure that its employees who dealt with Ms. Hoyt's accommodation request understand the content of the employer's duty and follow the process directives in Meiorin. It is for these reasons I find that this request for remedy is justified.\n[138] I order, pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA, that CN cease the discriminatory practice and that CN take such measures, in consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in the future, and in particular that CN take such measures as are necessary to ensure that the Respondent and its employees charged with facilitating accommodation understand the content of the employer's duty to accommodate pregnant employees and the procedures to be employed when facilitating same.\n(ii) Compensation for Lost Wages and Benefits [139] Pursuant to section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA, I order CN to compensate Ms. Hoyt for all wages and benefits that she has lost from February 18, 2002 until the date she returned to drive the crew van in July of 2002. I am advised that Ms. Hoyt has received some monies from CN as partial compensation for wage loss during this period and direct that the compensation be adjusted accordingly.\n(iii) Compensation for Pain and Suffering [140] Ms. Hoyt testified about the emotional impact that CN's conduct created for her. Ms. Hoyt described feeling bewildered at first. She had assumed CN would discharge its legal duty to accommodate her. She then felt betrayed by her employer, felt unvalued and depressed. Our courts have recognized the centrality of one's employment to one's sense of identity, self-worth and emotional well-being (Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.) [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313 at 368). It is sad but not surprising to hear of the pain caused to Ms. Hoyt by the conduct of her employer. The anxiety and distress of being left at home without any accommodation, without any communication from CN, not even after she had written a letter asking for information, was exacerbated as time dragged on. Ms. Hoyt worried that the time off work would disqualify her from receiving Employment Insurance maternity benefits. CN's conduct took a heavy toll on Ms. Hoyt, a toll visited on her at a time that might otherwise have been a happy time for her and her family as they planned for and dreamed about a new child.\n[141] Ms. Hoyt suffered significant distress on her return to CN upon accepting the crew van driver position. When she learned that CN again refused to reasonably accommodate her and insisted that, after three and a half months of unpaid leave, her accommodation for child care issues would be three more days of unpaid leave, Ms. Hoyt became very agitated and upset. Her symptoms were acute enough to cause her to go to the hospital very shortly after her altercation with Mr. Sherbo. Her doctor directed that she remain off work for one month as the distress she suffered, and was likely to continue to suffer, at the workplace as a result of CN's most recent discriminatory position, would compromise her own health and that of her unborn child.\n[142] I find that Ms. Hoyt experienced significant pain and suffering. I order, pursuant to s. 53(3) of the CHRA, CN to pay Ms. Hoyt $15,000.00 in compensation for this pain and suffering.\n(iv) Special Compensation [143] The complainant asks for special compensation. Under the CHRA the Tribunal has the power to award a maximum of $20,000.00 upon finding that a respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly (section 53(3)). I have found that CN knew that it was engaging in a discriminatory practice, or was reckless to believe it was not. Special compensation is accordingly appropriate and I award $10,000.00.\n(v) Legal Costs [144] The complainant asks for an order directing that the respondent pay the legal costs incurred by her during the course of this proceeding. Section 53(2)(c) empowers the Tribunal, where it finds that a complaint is substantiated, to make among other orders, an order that the respondent compensate the victim for `any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.'\n[145] The question of whether section 53(2)(c) empowers this Tribunal to make awards of legal expenses has been the subject of some manner of controversy in the Federal Court. Two decisions find that the Tribunal does have such jurisdiction (Canada (Attorney General) v. Thwaites (1994) 21 C.H.R.R. D\/224, Canada (Attorney General) v. Brooks [2006] FC 500(TD)). One decision finds that the Tribunal does not have such jurisdiction (Canada (Attorney General) v. Green [2004] 4 F.C. 629 (T.D.).\n[146] The Federal Court decisions upholding the Tribunal's jurisdiction observe that there is no reason to restrict the ordinary meaning of `any expenses incurred' so as to exclude legal costs incurred by a victim. That lawyers and judges might attach a particular significance to the term `costs' provides no basis to argue that the ordinary meaning of `expenses incurred' excludes legal costs (See Thwaites, per Gibson, J.).\n[147] This Tribunal has asserted the jurisdiction to award costs. Chairperson Mactavish (as she then was) employed a purposeful approach to the question of the Tribunal's jurisdiction (Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 29). Agreeing with the conclusion in Thwaites reached by employing a conventional statutory interpretation, Chairperson Mactavish noted that human rights legislation, given its fundamental and quasi-constitutional status is to be given a liberal and purposive construction not only in respect to the rights protected under such statutes, but in respect of the remedial powers conferred (Nkwazi, at para. 13; see also Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at 1136; Robichaud v. The Queen, [1987] 2 S.C.R 84).\n[148] I agree that a conclusion that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to make costs awards is sustainable and appropriate under a conventional construction of the legislation. Moreover, such a conclusion is demanded by the liberal and purposive construction that the CHRA properly attracts.\n[149] I also agree with Chairperson Mactavish that, `where a complaint is substantiated, the task of the Tribunal is to attempt, insofar as may be possible, to make whole the victim of the discriminatory practice, subject to principles of forseeability, remoteness and mitigation' (Nkwazi, supra, at para. 17). And I further agree that the CHRA, in conferring remedial jurisdiction makes it clear that the Tribunal has the power to make the remedial orders that are appropriate having regard to the circumstances of each individual case (Nkwazi, supra, at para.18).\n[150] First, there can be no question that it is possible for CN to make Ms. Hoyt whole regarding her legal expenses. CN's witnesses confirmed that the company is doing very well financially. A newspaper article was filed as an exhibit in the proceedings. The article from the Toronto Star and dated April 21, 2006, identifies that CN posted a first quarter profit of $362 million in 2006.\n[151] Secondly, I find no issues arising with regard to forseeability or remoteness that might properly limit an award of legal costs. I have found that CN knew or ought to have known that it was engaging in a discriminatory practice. Ms. Hoyt's legal costs arose as a result of the discriminatory practice. It should have been entirely foreseeable to this sophisticated employer that an employee subjected to the kind of conduct disclosed on the evidence of this case, would retain counsel and incur legal expenses.\n[152] Third, I am unaware of any facts that might suggest that the issue of mitigation might have application here such that it might properly limit an award of legal costs. I did not find that the complainant or her counsel took unreasonable positions or unduly protracted these proceedings. I am unaware of any offer of settlement that might have been extended by CN in advance of the hearing. If an offer of settlement was tendered exceeding the remedies ordered, such offer might go to the issue of mitigation. Should there have been an offer of settlement of the nature described, I invite further submissions from counsel.\n[153] I find in the circumstances that, subject to evidence of an offer to settle as mentioned above, the complainant should be reimbursed her legal expenses and I order that CN will reimburse the complainant for her reasonable legal expenses. I would encourage the parties to endeavour to agree on an appropriate amount in this regard, but will remain seized of the matter in the event that no agreement is possible.\n(vi) Interest [154] Interest is payable in respect of all the awards made in this decision pursuant to section 53(4) of the Act. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the bank rate (monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada, per Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. With respect to the compensation for pain and suffering and the special compensation, the interest shall run from the date of the complaint.\n(vii) Retention of Jurisdiction by the Tribunal [155] The Tribunal will retain jurisdiction to receive evidence, hear further submissions and make further orders, if the parties are unable to reach an agreement with respect to any issues arising from the within decision and in respect of the interpretation or implementation of the remedies ordered. Should the parties require direction on any remedial matter other than the section 53(2)(a) order, they may do so no more than 60 days after the date of this decision.\nB. Relief Requested by the Interested Party (i) Legal Costs [156] The Union, an interested party, seeks reimbursement for its legal costs. I find that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to make such an award. Section 53(2)(c) confers jurisdiction to make an award that the respondent compensate `the victim' in respect of expenses incurred `by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.' I find that whether under a conventional construction or liberal and purposive construction of this section of the Act, this Tribunal's jurisdiction to award remedies arises only where a discriminatory practice is found to have occurred and then only to the victim of the discriminatory practice. The Union feels aggrieved by the allegations made against it by CN. The Union however, does not allege that it was a victim of discriminatory practice.\n(ii) Declaration [157] The Union seeks a declaration by the Tribunal that it was not at fault in the actions taken regarding Ms. Hoyt's accommodation. I find that I do not have the jurisdiction to make such a declaration in favor of an interested party. I have dealt with the conduct of both CN and the Union in the body of this decision. This will have to suffice.\nsigned by Julie C.Loyd\nOTTAWA, Ontario August 18, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T1036\/1705\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Catherine Hoyt v.

INTRODUCTION [1] Karen Schulyer is a member of the Oneida Nation of the Thames in southern Ontario. She left the community when she was young and returned to take up the senior administrative position in the Band Administration. She was later diagnosed with cancer and hospitalized.\n[2] After Ms. Schuyler left the hospital, she advised the Band that she wanted to return to a part-time position. This did not work out, and she filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, on January 20, 2004, alleging that the Band had failed to accommodate her.\n[3] When Ms. Schuyler returned to work, her relationship with the Band Council continued to deteriorate. She believed that Council was angry that she filed the first complaint and was retaliating. After a rather arduous series of events, she was dismissed. This led to a second complaint, which was not filed until January 20, 2004.\n[4] The two complaints were referred to the Tribunal by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the CHRC). A hearing was held in London, Ontario in May, September and December, 2006. The following decision reviews the evidence led by both sides and disposes of the complaints.\nII. FACTS [5] It is helpful to know something about the operations of the Band before proceeding to the facts. During Ms. Schuyler's tenure, the Executive Administrator was the most senior position in the Band administration. This position has now been replaced by a Director of Operations, possibly because of the issues that arose in the present case.\n[6] Randy Phillips worked as a policy analyst for the Oneida Nation and was later elected as Chief. He testified that the power to make decisions in the Band rests generally with Council. Council meets approximately once a week, in the evening. Ideally, decisions are made by consensus. When that fails, a vote is held and the majority decides the motion. The Executive Administrator may raise issues at the Council but does not participate directly, other than to advise Council.\n[7] Mr. Phillips testified that Ms. Schulyer did not have a good relationship with Council. He was kind enough to say that some of this was a reflection of the difficulties inherent in the position. Council tended to blame the Executive Administrator when its policies were not being implemented.\nA. Performance review: July 2000 [8] Ms. Schuyler was hired by the Band Council as the Executive Administrator in June, 1998. She proposed a management contract, which Council declined. She was given a standard Council contract in July, which included a six month period of probation.\n[9] Chief Harry Doxtator was Chief of the Oneida for approximately twelve years and has served as the Grand Chief of the Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians. He worked with Ms. Schuyler for four or five years and was the head of the probationary committee.\n[10] There were problems from the start. Chief Doxtator testified that there was a questionnaire given to staff. There was also an interview scheduled with Ms. Schuyler, which she called off, apparently on the basis that she was concerned with the use of the questionnaire. She wanted to see the questionnaires.\n[11] It seems clear that the committee felt that Ms. Schuyler was a poor manager. She followed unusual management practices and sometimes failed to follow proper procedures. The process quickly became adversarial. I accept Chief Doxtator's testimony that she said it was going to cost them a lot of money if they wanted to get rid of her.\n[12] Ms. Schuyler, for her part, complained that it took three years to complete the probationary review. There was a lot of haggling. At one point, the evaluation committee wrote her a letter, asking her to address a number of concerns. She sent them an extensive reply on May 13, 1999.\n[13] It was not until June 20, 2000, however, that the committee conducted the review process. Ms. Schuyler was ranked as average or below average on all of the performance factors in the personal evaluation. It contained outstanding scores for initiative, assertiveness and confidence. The truth, however, is that the evaluation committee expressed concerns about her performance.\n[14] Ms. Schuyler refused to sign the evaluation. In a written response, on June 26, 2000, she took the position that the failure of the Council to separate the roles of Council and the administration undermined the authority and credibility of the Executive Administrator. It seems characteristic that she did not acknowledge the difficulties she had experienced in maintaining her working relations with other people.\n[15] In spite of the disagreements, a number of recommendations came out of the evaluation report. One was that an ad hoc grievance committee be established to deal with any issues relating to the Administrative Executor. One was that Ms. Schuyler obtain her grade twelve equivalency.\n[16] The report went to Council on July 25, 2000. It was discussed by Council in the early morning hours, after one of the regular meetings. Ms. Schuyler thought this was unfair. Chief Doxtator did not agree. The matter was pressing and there was no other time to deal with it.\n[17] The Councilors concentrated on the things that the program managers had said. The Committee had sent questionnaires to the Chief, Council and staff. She says that she wasn't able to respond properly because she didn't have the questionnaires. They said that the questionnaires were destroyed.\n[18] Council ultimately accepted the report and requested a six month follow up. This was scheduled but never occurred. Ms. Schuyler felt that the process was one-sided and incomplete. She says that she was forced to agree to things under duress as a result of the hour and the emotional pressure placed upon her.\n[19] Ms. Schuyler felt that she was being treated differently because she had lived off the reserve for 35 years. The draft evaluation stated that she needed to reintegrate herself into the community. She asked them to remove this reference from the final evaluation. She didn't feel any need to be reintegrated into the community. It is notable that her position changed in cross-examination.\n[20] It seems clear that the bulk of the problem lay with the twenty five program managers who reported to the Executive Administrator. Ms. Schuyler's relations with these managers were strained, to say the least. There was a controversial email that made the rounds on November 28, 2000 with a copy to Ms. Schulyer complaining about her management style. The significance of this email is simply that there was dissatisfaction among the staff.\n[21] Ms. Schuyler says the problem was with Council. Her relationship with Council was poor and continued to worsen over the entire period of the complaints. The lines of authority weren't clear and the program managers continually went to Council behind her back. At one point, she stated that the staff probably didn't like her because she had disciplined them.\n[22] Randy Phillips took the side of the program managers and remembers an intervention from the Canadian Human Rights Commission or Labour Board. There was an attempt to mediate the dispute on January 27, 2001. It appears that fifteen to twenty people participated. This included Ms. Schuyler, a number of program managers, the Chief and two Council members.\n[23] It all sounds very trying. Ms. Schuyler was on the defensive and discussed a possible human rights complaint with one of the mediators. There was an agreement drawn up at the end of the mediation. Only three of the program managers signed it: the rest refused. They were apparently unhappy with the process. The review of Ms. Schuyler's job performance continued.\n[24] There was a meeting between the evaluation committee and Ms. Schulyer, on March 22, 2001, to do the follow up. She protested. The committee asked her to put her concerns in writing, which she did by means of a written memorandum, dated April 25, 2001. There was no response.\nB. Cancer: July 2001 [25] Ms. Schuyler became sick in July 2001. She was hospitalized for about eight days, with a bowel blockage. She couldn't keep food down and was getting very weak. She was fed intravenously. Eventually, the blockage cleared itself. After she left the hospital, Ms. Schuyler took sick leave, and then a vacation. She was off work until the beginning of September.\n[26] Ms. Schuyler testified that she was being treated for peptic ulcers at this time and was losing weight. I allowed a letter from Dr. McDonough into evidence but excluded his case notes. The doctor has apparently moved to Ireland and is no longer available. The Tribunal can relax the rules of evidence in the interests of determining the truth.\n[27] The Respondent has not disputed the rough outlines of the situation described in the letter. The letter states that Ms. Schulyer was under stress. The details of Ms. Schuyler's medical record are not in issue. It is apparent that the deteriorating situation at work was affecting her physically. She was tired and couldn't concentrate.\n[28] Ms. Schuyler went through a number of medical tests between September and November. In November, her doctor ordered her to take two weeks off work. This was followed by another note, again to stay off work. She had a colonoscopy on December 21st.\n[29] Ms. Schuyler's doctors discovered that she had cancer of the colon. There were more tests and she went into surgery at the beginning of February. She was in the hospital for eight days and part of her colon was removed. She was at home, recovering, until May, 2002, and took chemotherapy up until September.\nC. Part-time: May 6, 2002 [30] In her final submissions, Ms. Schuyler states that she was determined to get back to work.\nAfter having been through a life-threatening experience, I wanted an opportunity to return to normal life. I thought returning to work part-time would be the beginning of that. I knew I could not fulfill the entire role of Executive Administrator on a part-time schedule but felt I still had valuable contributions to make.\nIn April, Dr. McDonough agreed that Ms. Schuyler could return to half-time work.\n[31] Ms. Schuyler then contacted Holly Elijiah, the Acting Executive Administrator, who must have spoken to Chief Doxtator. The Chief phoned Ms. Schuyler and told her that Council was concerned about her returning to work. The evidence suggests that they felt that she wouldn't be able to deal with the pressure. But I agree with Ms. Schuyler: they didn't want her back.\n[32] Chief Doxtator informed Ms. Schuyler that the human resources committee would have to review the situation. She would have to meet with them. Ms. Schuyler felt that they were simply trying to stop her from coming back. There was nevertheless a band policy. An employee had to meet with a human resources committee before returning to work from a long absence.\n[33] There was some antagonism on both sides. On May 6th, Ms. Schuyler apparently told Chief Doxtator that her cancer was a disability and the Band would have to accommodate her under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Chief Doxtator responded that they needed a medical note.\n[34] Ms. Schuyler was feeling mistrustful. She wrote a letter to Chief Doxtator two days later, expressing her disappointment with the fact that they hadn't given her part-time work. She delivered the letter to his office the next day. She also met with the Human Resources Committee.\n[35] The meeting was on the litigious side. The committee raised seven points, ranging from medical documentation to the hours that she wanted to work. They also indicated that they felt obliged to respect the contracts that had been entered into while she was away. They apparently felt that they were already full staffed.\n[36] The committee made it clear that her position had been given to someone else. There was a real reluctance to bring her back. The meeting lasted an hour and a half. The committee wanted her to take a lesser position. They agreed to draw up a position for her, but it wouldn't be the same position or the same salary. She felt they were delivering a message from Council. They didn't want her back.\n[37] Ms. Schuyler broke down in tears on the stand. The Committee gave her an awful feeling. They acted as if cancer was catching or something. She expected more compassion. It didn't matter to them if she was feeling better or not. It didn't matter to them whether she was still alive or not. Ms. Schuyler said that the Committee felt that she was mentally incapable of handling any kind of workload.\n[38] It was a complicated situation. In spite of this, I am satisfied that, behind the indifference, Council and the staff had some genuine concerns for Ms. Schuyler's well-being. Ms. Elijah testified that the thought on the reserve was that she was going to die. This does not mean that they wanted to accommodate her.\n[39] The Human Resources Committee told Ms. Schuyler that they would provide a written recommendation to Council. Charlie Cornelius said that they would show it to her first. She received the report on May 14th. She discussed it with Lois Cornelius, a member of the Committee, who supplied it to her. She told Ms. Cornelius that she wasn't happy with the statement in the report saying that she would have no authority.\n[40] Ms. Schuyler obtained a note from her oncologist on May 15th, and met with the Chief. The note suggested that she was in the best position to determine what an appropriate work-load would be, and she advised him that she wanted to be consulted, in determining her duties. This would appear to be a natural part of any reasonable process of accommodation.\n[41] The Report went to Band Council on June 12, which agreed to employ her. She would be supervised by Holly Elijiah, the Acting Executive Administrator. Ms. Elijah had been Ms. Schuyler's assistant when Ms. Schuyler was first hired. Council took the position, as did Chief Doxtator, that the Executive Administrator position could not be staffed on a part-time basis. Nor could it be filled by two people.\n[42] On the same day, Ms. Elijah replied on behalf of the Band, sending Ms. Schuyler an employment agreement, describing a part-time position with modified duties. The position that was offered to Ms. Schuyler was Special Projects Administrator. This position did not enjoy the same responsibilities or authority over staff. The new contract for the position also stated that there was a three month probationary period.\n[43] The agreement stated that Ms. Schuyler was to report to the Acting Executive Administrator, Chief and Council, and Department Heads. The Department Heads were Program Managers. This was a demotion of sorts, since they had been under her supervision. It is evident that she wanted to retain some element of her authority.\n[44] Ms. Schuyler testified that she would have been happy to help Ms. Elijiah on a part-time basis, but she wanted some say in deciding what work she would be given. The most troubling aspect of the offer was that there was a three month term of probation. I think Ms. Schuyler is within her rights in saying that this was unacceptable. She was worried, moreover, that this would put them in a position to let her go.\n[45] Ms. Schuyler went to a lawyer, Adrian Cameron. After discussing the offer of part-time employment with him, she decided to reject it. She wasn't prepared to go back, on the terms that they were offering. She thought it was better to walk away until she could return full-time. She indicated to the Insurance Company that she would not be going back to work until her chemotherapy was completed.\n[46] Ms. Elijah felt that the Band followed the personnel policy, in good faith. Chief Doxtator seemed to back her up. They took the position that Ms. Schuyler simply refused to participate in the process. There may be some defensiveness in this: I think the matter is a good deal more nuanced and the Band was not particularly interested in accommodating her.\n[47] Ms. Schuyler's lawyer advised Council on June 19, 2002 that she was unable to return to work and would be receiving full-time disability. His letter referred to multiple breaches of the Canadian Human Rights Act and stated that she would be asking for accommodation when she returned.\n[48] At the beginning of July, when a new Band Council was elected, Ms. Schuyler gave Ms. Elijiah a chapter from a book, When Life Becomes Precious: A Guide for Loved Ones and Friends of Cancer Patients, by Elise NeeDell Babcock. It contains guidelines for employers, in dealing with situations where an employee has cancer. This was apparently distributed to the new council, since Rolanda Elijiah and Luke Nicholas, two of the new councilors, came by her home to speak to her about it.\n[49] The first complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission was filed the following month. Ms. Schuyler also filed a complaint with Labour Canada on August 26, 2002, stating that she was constructively dismissed. I gather that the later complaint was later withdrawn.\nD. Return to work: October 15, 2002 [50] Ms. Schuyler received a full-time disability allowance until October 15, 2002. She received Employment Insurance from the end of January to May 2002. She received welfare for one month, during June of the same year. She eventually finished her chemotherapy and received traditional counseling.\n[51] Ms. Schuyler did a lot of soul searching. She says that she forgave everyone for the problems in the past and let go of her bitterness. She decided to let bygones be bygones. She maintains that she returned to full-time work in October, 2002 with good feelings.\n[52] This was transitory. Ms. Schuyler had difficulties with the new Council and was terminated eleven months later. She felt that her problems lay with the Chief. She said it was as if he didn't want to be close to her, physically. There was a lack of communication. She complained of nepotism and explained: I wasn't related to him.\n[53] On October 15th, Ms. Schuyler met with Chief Doxtator. He wanted a medical note, signed by her oncologist. She felt that she was already running into road-blocks. Ms. Schuyler nevertheless drove to the hospital, obtained a note, and returned to the Band office. She couldn't find Chief Doxtator and felt that he was ignoring her.\n[54] Ms. Schuyler drafted a motion and asked the Council Recorder to put it on the agenda for the next meeting. The motion stated that Council accepted the medical documentation that she provided and recognized that she was medically fit to return to her position as Executive Administrator. It also directed all employees to co-operate in her return to work. She says that Council removed a paragraph welcoming her back.\n[55] The meeting was uncomfortable. Ms. Schuyler testified that there was a strange feeling in the room. People shuffled papers and looked away. Everybody seemed to look at the floor. The motion was nevertheless passed. She was informed later that Holly Elijiah would keep her position as Acting Executive Administrator for the rest of the year. So there were two Executive Administrators.\n[56] This was never properly explained, and seems to run against the position that the Band had taken with respect to part-time work. Ms. Schuyler feels that they kept Ms. Elijiah in the position because they had no confidence in her ability to carry out her duties. I think that there was probably a measure of truth in her perceptions. She nevertheless accepted the situation. She didn't want to create any animosity.\n[57] Chief Doxtator took a different view than Ms. Schuyler. He testified that the relationship between Council and Ms. Schuyler when she returned was welcome back. This evaporated over time, but only because Council became increasingly aware that Ms. Schuyler lacked the personal skills to deal with the interpersonal aspects of her job.\n[58] Ms. Schuyler spent most of November doing the performance evaluations of the program managers. They were self-evaluations. She didn't have much contact with the Chief. Ms. Elijiah was primarily occupied with catching up on the Council minutes. There was a staff retreat in early November. They discussed the need to separate the political and administrative functions of the band.\n[59] The old animosities were still there, however. Somewhere along the way, she was asked to withdraw the complaint. At some point, probably at the beginning of 2003, Ms. Schuyler says that someone put a post-it note reading Enter at your own risk on her office door. The level of mistrust in the office was high enough that Ms. Elijiah testified that the note was in Ms. Schuyler's handwriting.\n[60] Ms. Schuyler felt that people did not want her back. She attributed it to the fact that she had filed the human rights complaint in July, 2001. She said that Council does not like being sued. She had seen their attitude to litigants in other cases. They didn't like the fact that anyone would challenge them. No one said this, but the feeling was there.\n[61] There were increasing problems. There was a special meeting of Council in December, 2002, to separate the political and administrative functions of the Band. This included separating the political staff from the administration. It appears that there was a struggle with Ms. Schuyler over the issue, since it would remove some of Ms. Schuyler's staff from her supervision.\n[62] There was a Council meeting on January 7th, 2003, which dealt with personnel problems at the healing lodge. Ms. Schuyler thought that the issue had been resolved in 2001. Chief Doxtator did not know why it took so long for the issue to come to the attention of Council. The Council issued Ms. Schuyler a verbal warning to her for the way she dealt with the issue. She received a letter two weeks later.\n[63] It is obvious that there were deeper problems. Some of it was personality; but there was more to it than this. The Respondent takes the position that Ms. Schuyler wasn't capable of doing her job. Ms. Schuyler felt that they were looking for excuses to reprimand her. She was blamed for everything. She was a non-person. It was the beginning of beating her down.\n(i) The occupation: March 7, 2003 [64] Then there was the occupation. The provincial police had obtained permission to carry out a homicide investigation on the reserve. They arrived on March 7, 2003, with a dozen or more police officers. This upset many people. There was a flurry of phone calls to the administration. The traditional chief at the administration building found it impossible to deal with all of the calls and left the building in exasperation.\n[65] It was territorial. People were angry that there were OPP vehicles on the reserve. Chief Doxtator testified that four or five members of the Band eventually came into the Administration Building and wanted everyone to go home. They suggested that staff needed time off. One of them had a six foot cane, two inches thick. He was banging it on the floor.\n[66] Holly Elijiah had a similar recollection. She testified that four men brought in a heavy staff of some sort, possibly a condolence cane, and started pounding it on the floor. They had been drinking; they were yelling; and they threatened the staff and told them to leave the administration building. They wanted the police off the reserve.\n[67] Chief Doxtator refused to leave. Ms. Elijah felt that this was dangerous. There were discussions and a decision was made to vacate the building. Most of the staff were gone by 4:30. Chief Doxtator did a round of the offices, to see that everyone had left. He was the last person in the building. He wanted to close it. The men had come back, however, and announced that they were staying in the building.\n[68] The crisis escalated and eventually dozens of protesters occupied the main administration office. They then took over the entire plant. This was on a Friday. It took until Tuesday or Wednesday to resolve the situation. There were about one hundred and seventy five employees locked out. Ms. Elijiah testified that the staff was traumatized. They felt physically threatened.\n[69] Ms. Elijah still feels traumatized. She feels that the problem was that no one was in charge and blames this on Ms. Schuyler, who did not come into the office that day. Ms. Elijah is suspicious of this: she said that Ms. Schuyler had never told anyone that she wouldn't be there. The assistant was also away.\n[70] After the occupation, there were many meetings to deal with the concerns of staff. Ms. Elijiah testified that Ms. Schuyler was unsympathetic, even scornful. She called them victims and said they should all simply go back to work. Ms. Elijah says that this was the beginning of the end. The staff resented Ms. Schuyler for failing to support or protect them.\n[71] There was a staff meeting in Council chambers, some days after the occupation. Ms. Schulyer and Mr. Phillips spoke in private before the meeting. Mr. Phillips stated that Ms. Schulyer said people were acting like victims. There are two versions of what happened at the meeting. Mr. Phillips said that Ms. Schuyler then repeated these remarks in the meeting. This upset some of the individuals who were there. Ms. Schuyler said that Mr. Phillips made the remark.\n[72] There was some personal counseling offered to employees after the occupation. There was also a traditional healing circle, though Ms. Elijah feels that it was nothing more than an opportunity to vent. This still rankles: she didn't want to go and spill her guts out in front of everyone. She wanted a plan in place, to deal with the kind of situation that led to the occupation.\n[73] There was also an issue concerning the staff who participated in the occupation. Ms. Elijah wanted them disciplined. Ms. Schuyler felt that it was a more complex situation and wanted Council to deal with it. The evidence is unclear. One witness stated that Council had to instruct Ms. Schuyler to deal with the matter.\n[74] Ms. Schuyler, on the other hand, testified that Council dealt with the disciplinary issue without consulting her. This led some of her staff to believe that she was part of the occupation. In any event, the occupation and the recriminations that followed led to a further deterioration in Ms. Schuyler's working relationships. Ms. Schuyler felt that members of her staff had gone to Council behind her back.\nE. Termination [75] It is hard to disentangle what was happening from what Ms. Schuyler perceived, but the situation was deteriorating on both sides. There was something in the background that no one was really saying. She felt invisible. Her recommendations were not taken seriously. People would smile to her face, but then something else would come up.\n[76] Ms. Schuyler is convinced that Council didn't want her there because she filed the human rights complaint. They were looking for ways to get rid of her. The staff sensed that Council didn't trust her. They lost confidence in her as a result. There were allegations that she didn't support them.\n[77] Ms. Schuyler listed thirty incidents of retaliatory conduct. There was, for example, a conflict of interest with one of the managers. She had difficulty dealing with it. Her word didn't carry any authority any more. There is a measure of truth in all this, but it is tempered by the fact that the Chief and Council had real issues with Ms. Schuyler's job performance.\n[78] There was a Council meeting on May 6, 2003, to deal with the plan to separate the political and administrative functions of the Band. The first step in that plan, taken at the same meeting, was to ask the Executive Administrator, i.e. Ms. Schuyler, to attend Council meetings on the first and third Tuesday of the month. Ms. Schuyler says that this was merely to keep her out of meetings.\n[79] Ms. Schuyler felt that she was laughed at when she asked questions at Council. She was called insubordinate. Ms. Schuyler felt that it was part of the Executive Administrator's responsibility to attend meetings. Council took the position that it had the authority to change her responsibilities, however, and were within their rights to ask her not to attend meetings.\n[80] Randy Phillips testified that Ms. Schuyler was asked to report only to the last meeting of the month. This led to a flare-up with a councilor, Faye Antone, who was laughing. Ms. Schuyler asked her not to laugh at her. Ms. Antone replied by telling her that the Council was her employer and that she was to do as she was told. There was also an incident with Ms. Elijah.\n[81] Ms. Schuyler complained that Band Council removed Holly Elijiah and Randy Phillips from her supervision. Mr. Phillips said that this was part of an ongoing process. As a policy analyst, he had proposed a policy secretariat, which would report directly to the Chief and Council. This was on the basis that its responsibilities were on the political side of the political\/administrative divide and was not related to the delivery of programs and services.\n[82] It is hard to keep the lines of the narrative clear. There were battles everywhere. There was an issue, for example, between Ms. Schuyler and Mr. Stacey Phillips, a staff member and Councilor. There were loud arguments between the two of them. Mr. Phillips did not accept Ms. Schuyler's authority as his supervisor and kept going over her head, to Council.\n[83] Ms. Schuyler maintains that Council continued to deal with administrative matters, in spite of all the talk about separating the functions of the Band. Some of the problem was undoubtedly that it was open to staff to sit on Council, which made their supervision extremely problematic. Issues between the Executive Administrator and individual staff members must have affected Council business.\n[84] Ms. Schuyler wanted to change the personnel policy to prevent councilors from being employed by the Band. The Respondent says that section 5.8 of the Election Code prevented this. She says that the Election Code has not been passed in a referendum. The provisions of the Indian Act accordingly apply.\n[85] There is a draft Customs Election Code, which was periodically discussed by Council. Holly Elijah said that the Band has been trying to finalize the Code for twelve years. One provision, 5.8, says that any employees who are elected Chief or Councilors must leave the Band's employment. The Election Code has not been passed, however, and at the time in question, staff members had a right to run for council.\n[86] The relations between many of the different individuals in the story were edged with personal rancor. It is clear from Chief Doxtator's testimony that there was a rivalry of sorts between Randy Phillips and Ms. Schuyler. Council was not a part of this. Ms. Schuyler alleges that Mr. Phillips gave funding information directly to the program managers, bypassing her office. They seem to have been competing for the loyalties of the managers.\n[87] There appear to have been similar issues between Ms. Schuyler and Ms. Elijiah. This was evident in the tone of voice and body language used by Ms. Elijah on the witness stand. At one point in the cross-examination, she refused to look at Ms. Schuyler and referred to her in the third person.\n[88] In any event, it was all very personal. Ms. Schuyler has complained, for example, that Randy Phillips had been allowed to do some of his work at home for a number of weeks, so that he could care for his father. Ms. Schuyler said the Band failed to accommodate her in the same way.\n[89] The level of detail is numbing. There was an issue between Ms. Schuyler and a councilor with respect to funding for the Casino-Rama. There were disputes concerning honoraria for attending Council meetings, the awarding of jobs, and a variety of other issues.\n[90] Everything was entangled. Ms. Schuyler's daughter was the employment and training administrator. Council understandably saw this as a conflict of interest and did not want her reporting to her mother. She was accordingly placed under the supervision of Mr. Phillips, who was now under Council's supervision rather Ms. Schuyler's.\n[91] There was a dispute regarding the disclosure of letters complaining about Verna Brown. There were issues between Cyndi White, the Human Resource Coordinator, and Ms. Schuyler. They didn't trust each other. Ms. White thought that Ms. Schuyler, her supervisor, was editing her reports to counsel. So she went over Ms. Schuyler's head and spoke directly to Council.\n[92] Matters continued to get worse. Ms. Schuyler wasn't kept informed of what was happening in Council. The minute book was no longer available to her. The Council Recorder--Ms. Elijiah, who had also been removed from Ms. Schuyler's supervision--would not let her see it. Ms. Elijah said that she was following the instructions of Council. The in camera minutes were never to leave the building.\n[93] Chief Doxtator does not recall any disputes about the in camera minutes book. He did not see the direction that Ms. Schuyler only appear at Council meetings to provide her report as an attempt to exclude her. She would still be required to appear at meetings where issues arose that needed her input. Nor did he see the change in the reporting requirements of Holly Elijah and Randy Phillips as an attempt to undermine her authority.\n[94] Ms. Schuyler decided to go to the meetings as a member of the community. This strategy didn't go over well. There was a general break-down in her relations with Council. In July, she complained about the situation in her monthly report. She had discussed the situation with her lawyer and advised Council that its conduct was tantamount to constructive dismissal. Council disagreed.\n[95] The evidence is that the politics were intense. Everyone seems to agree, however, that the continuing conflicts and ongoing litigation had poisoned what was left of the relationship between Ms. Schuyler and Band Council. The evidence does not support the allegation that this was done in retribution for filing the complaint.\n[96] There was an elder sit-in in August, 2003, at the Health Department office across the road from the administration office. The person who was the long-term care coordinator was suspended. As a result, a number of senior citizens and others occupied the building. Ms. Schuyler did not handle the situation well. The police were called.\n[97] Ms. Schuyler responded with a letter from her lawyer to Mr. Peters, counsel for the Band, on August 21, 2003. The letter alleged that that the Band's treatment of the Complainant was retaliation for the human rights complaint.\n[98] There was some issue as to whether Ms. Schuyler was getting her work done, as a result of the issue over Council meetings. The matter was serious enough that the Chief wrote a letter to Ms. Schuyler on behalf of Council on July 9, 2003 directing her that she was to attend Council as required. The letter gave her a second warning.\n[99] There was a meeting of Council on August 28, 2003 to deal with Ms. Schuyler's performance. There was a motion to dismiss her from the position of Executive Administrator. The minutes list eleven items of misconduct. The language is strong. The first two items refer to acts of insolence. The next item refers to acts of insubordination. There is another reference to her breach of her duty of loyalty and good faith to Council, and references to her manner with staff.\n[100] Then there were substantive complaints, the most serious being an allegation that Ms. Schuyler failed to implement over 100 items designated to her by Council over the previous five years. There is a separate list of forty-one outstanding Administrative Action Items from 2002 to 2003, thirty-eight of which required action from the Executive Administrator that was provided to Council members before the meeting. The requests range from the implementation of the mosquito program to a proposal to purchase a new fire truck, to the provision of committee lists.\n[101] Chief Doxtator chaired the meeting on August 28th. He feels that the concerns expressed at the meeting were valid. They reflect the rather desperate situation that existed at that time. Ms. Schuyler was argumentative and contrary, in her dealings with Council. There was none of the trust that was necessary to maintain a proper working relationship. There was insubordination. There was a failure of co-operation. There were problems with staff morale.\n[102] Chief Doxtator agreed that there was a poisonous scenario at the office. He attributed this to Ms. Schuyler, however. There was no attempt to force her to quit. There were a number of confrontations at Council table but he did not feel that Council treated her badly. Council had never received so many complaints about an Executive Administrator. There was no discussion of Ms. Schulyer's illness or the complaint to the human rights Commission.\n[103] The minutes of the meeting were not signed by Council. This appears to be inadvertence. Ms. Elijah, who took the minutes, says the language used in the minutes was appropriate. It was all about Ms. Schuyler's attitude. She testified that the dismissal had nothing to do with Ms. Schuyler's illness. Mr. Phillips took the same position.\n[104] On September 4th, after the labour day weekend, Ms. Schuyler returned to work. She was given a letter from Chief Doxtator, stating that she was dismissed. The letter cited a number of reasons for her dismissal. The Chief said it was not up for discussion and she was escorted out the door. This brought Ms. Schuyler's troubled relationship with Council to an end.\n[105] The letter of dismissal is dated September 2, 2003. It is very stern and alleges eleven forms of misconduct. This includes continued acts of insolence and breaches of her duty of loyalty and good faith. Ms. Schulyer rejects all of these allegations. The letter offered her seven months severance pay. She was required to sign a release, however, which stated that any complaints that she had filed under the Canadian Human Rights Act or the Canada Labour Code were frivolous, vexatious, and an abuse of process.\n[106] It is a sad story. Ms. Schuyler's lawyer suggested that she accept the settlement. She refused. The issue was not the money. She felt the allegations were unfair. She had been `silently' discriminated against. She refused to sign the release. Afterwards, she felt isolated. Some of the staff and community members wouldn't talk to her.\n[107] In the fall of 2003, Ms. Schuyler filed another complaint under the Canada Labour Code. The second human rights complaint, alleging retaliation, was filed on January 20, 2004.\nIII. LEGAL ISSUES A. Retaliation [108] The second complaint was filed under section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which states:\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\nThere is a legal issue with respect to the requirements of retaliation.\n[109] The case law goes two ways. I prefer the position adopted by Member Deschamps in Virk v. Bell Canada (Ontario, 2005 CHRT 2 (2005\/01\/20), at para. 156:\n[156] Retaliation implies some form of willful conduct meant to harm or hurt the person who filed a human rights complaint for having filed the complaint. This view departs in part from those expressed in previous decisions of this Tribunal on the issue of retaliation (Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, [2001] CHRT 11; Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 40).\n[157] In Wong and Bressette, the views expressed are to the effect that a complainant does not have to prove an intention to retaliate and that if a complainant reasonably perceived the impugned conduct by the respondent to be in retaliation to the human rights complaint, this could amount to retaliation quite apart from any proven intention of the respondent. (Italics added)\nIt might be possible to find some support for the latter view in the fact that discrimination is not an intentional wrong.\n[110] With all respect to other views, I think M. Deschamps' interpretation is the right one:\n158] The burden of proving retaliation rests with the complainant who must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the person against whom he or she alleges retaliation knew of the existence of the complaint, that the person acted in an inopportune way and that the person's misbehaviour was motivated by the filing of a human rights complaint by the complainant.\nI would add that the word retaliation must be given its ordinary meaning. One has to worry about the credibility of a process that departs too far from the understanding of ordinary people.\n[111] Although M. Deschamps goes on to find that retaliation is a form of discrimination, it is a particular species, with its own requirements. My only observation is that the rules of statutory construction must be followed, here as elsewhere. The section refers to someone who is retaliating in the ordinary sense of the word. The definition in the Webster's-Merriam online dictionary emphasizes the notion of paying back. I think this is enough for the purposes of the present case.\nIV. ANALYSIS A. THE FIRST COMPLAINT [112] The first issue is whether the Respondent discriminated against Ms. Schuyler in May of 2002, by failing to accommodate her? There is no need to enter into an analysis of the prima facie case, which is easily made out.\n(i) Whether Ms. Schuyler failed to facilitate the process [113] The Respondent raises two defenses. The first is merely that it acted fairly and responsibly, and in keeping with the law.\n[114] Ms. Schuyler says that she was only looking to come back on a half-time basis. She was willing to take on individual projects and had no desire to change the interim administrative arrangements. The band says that they offered her this. They say that Ms. Schuyler then stopped communicating.\n[115] Mr. Peters says that the letter from Oneida on June 12, 2002 meets Ms. Schuyler's conditions. It gives her a flexible schedule. It provides a job description `for her perusal'. This was a first step. There was room for further negotiation. Mr. Peters relied on the decision in Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, where the Supreme Court stated that the complainant has a duty to participate in the search for accommodation and facilitate the process. The process of accommodation is a multi-party inquiry.\n[116] The Respondent says that Ms. Schuyler had an obligation to respond to the letter from the Band. Instead of doing this, she retained a lawyer, who advised the Band, in writing, that she was fully disabled. I think this is too simplistic: in my view, Ms. Schuyler felt rebuffed, and reasonably so. The Respondent's rendition of the facts leaves out the most important factor in the process, which was the clear message that the Band sent: they didn't want Ms. Schuyler back.\n[117] It is simply wrong to put the blame for the failed negotiations on Ms. Schuyler. Legally, the primary duty was on the Respondent, to try and find a way to bring her back. The negotiations with the personnel committee and the proposed contract failed to honor this fact. The contract did not recognize Ms. Schuyler's seniority and the probationary clause was completely unwarranted. Aside from the natural vulnerabilities that anyone would feel, after such a serious medical intervention, the process was disrespectful to someone in such a senior position.\n[118] I agree with Ms. Schuyler: the Band did not really want her back, and communicated that to her, in a variety of ways. An employer who sincerely wanted to accommodate her would have gone much further, in trying to work out some solution that was satisfactory to both sides. I realize that it was a difficult situation for both sides: Ms. Schuyler was suspicious and adversarial, and wanted things her way. I am nevertheless satisfied that the Band failed in its duty to accommodate her.\n[119] Here, as elsewhere, the employment dispute was uppermost. It is abundantly clear that the Band was unhappy with Ms. Schuyler's performance as the Executive Administrator. The performance review had been interrupted and was never satisfactorily concluded. Rather than deal with these aspects of the matter-fairly, responsibly and openly-the Respondent was content to let her go on disability. It was an easy way out of the situation.\n(ii) Estoppel [120] Mr. Peters makes another argument, however. He says that Ms. Schuyler was totally disabled. The Respondent accordingly had no obligation to accommodate her. I suppose it is a form of estoppel by conduct. Ms. Schuyler received full-time disability benefits. Mr. Peters says that she cannot accept these payments and claim that she was partially disabled and capable of coming back on a part-time basis.\n[121] There is no need to go into the technicalities of the matter. Ms. Schuyler only applied for full-time disability after the negotiations had broken down. By that point, Ms. Schuyler was alienated and suspicious, and didn't have the heart to pursue any further discussions. She had her health to worry about, and the psychological stress of dealing with the Band was too much.\n[122] I do not want to overstate the case, and I accept that some of the individuals involved in the process felt genuine concern for Ms. Schuyler's well-being. This was outweighed, however, by indifference and ill-will. The reality is that the actions of the Band contributed to the set of circumstances that left Ms. Schuyler totally disabled. It would be wrong to let the Respondent use this fact against her, in order to escape its obligations.\n(iii) Conclusions [123] I agree with Mr. Peters' submission that there are real limits on the duty to accommodate: it is not the duty of the Respondent, he submits, to help Ms. Schuyler in her recovery from cancer. This only goes so far, however, and in most cases, at least, the process of accommodation and the recovery process go hand in hand. I am not prepared to say that an employer has a legal obligation to be considerate, but it has an obligation to be fair and reasonable and, in many cases, I suspect that this amounts to the same thing.\n[124] There is a practical side to this: I would also suggest that a certain degree of empathy is an indispensable part of the process of accommodation. The upshot of this is that a Respondent is obliged to take the complainant's circumstances and condition into account in searching for an appropriate form of accommodation. An employer who adopts an adversarial approach to a person who has gone through a major medical or psychological crisis, and sends a clear message that the person is not welcome back, is probably in breach of its duty to accommodate people with disabilities.\n[125] The situation that presented itself in the present case was difficult for both sides, who came out of the interrupted performance review in medias res and had not sorted out their affairs. The Respondent was nevertheless obliged to sincerely enter the process of accommodation and search earnestly for an arrangement that would meet her needs. The Respondent was not negotiating in full good faith. This constitutes discrimination and is a breach of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The first complaint is substantiated.\nB. THE SECOND COMPLAINT [126] The second issue is whether the Respondent retaliated? I am not sure what to say about the prima facie case in this context, since I have discussed it at so much length elsewhere. Was there a prima facie case of retaliation? Perhaps. Would this shift the burden of proof to the Respondent? Decidedly not. The only question on the evidence is accordingly whether the complainant has proven on a balance of probabilities that she was retaliated against?\n[127] Ms. Schuyler made some thirty allegations, most of which follow the long series of events that culminated in the termination. Ms. Schuyler apparently attributes all of these events, and the termination, to the fact that she filed the original complaint. It is true that she retreated somewhat during the course of her submissions, and took the position that it was a factor in the decision. The result is the same: if it hadn't been for the human rights complaint, she says, she would have been able to sit down with the Chief and Council, and work out the other problems.\n[128] I find this view of the situation rather naive. Ms. Schuyler has been denying the obvious. There was a break-down in the relationship between Ms. Schuyler and the Band Council from the get-go, in the words of Mr. Peters. The first evaluation was symptomatic. The band's concerns were never properly addressed. Things were headed in a bad way when Ms. Schuyler discovered that she had cancer and were only going to get worse. The relationship continued to deteriorate when she returned.\n[129] The testimony of Chief Doxtator, whose evidence I accept, is enough to establish that the employment issues between the two parties were real. Those issues have been raised elsewhere and need to be separated from the allegations under the Canadian Human Rights Act. There was a larger set of circumstances, which was full of rancour, and there is very little to suggest that the human rights complaint had much to do with it. There is no real evidence of retaliation, outside of Ms. Schuyler's testimony.\n[130] The first allegation is that Ms. Schuyler didn't get her full authority back when she returned as the Executive Administrator. This is a reference to the fact that she shared the job with Holly Elijiah for two months. The Band Council has a reasonable response: it says that Ms. Elijiah was left in the position for her benefit and to provide a proper transition. I understand Ms. Schuyler's suspicions, but there is nothing to link this to the original complaint.\n[131] The second allegation had to do with the disciplinary action with respect to the situation at the healing lodge. This matter was left over from Ms. Schuyler's original term as Executive Administrator. It is true that Ms. Schuyler had an increasingly antagonistic relationship with Council, which was not improved by the complaint. But there is nothing in these kinds of specific instances that can be linked to the complaint.\n[132] There is little point in going through the thirty allegations in the complaint of retaliation, all of which reveal a deeply troubled relationship. There was an ongoing dispute, for example, about the appropriateness of the Executive Administrator attending Council meetings. One might think it strange that Council would exclude her. But the Chief and Council had a different view: it was really that Ms. Schuyler had become obsessed with the issue, and needed to focus on her own work.\n[133] The only question before me is whether this constituted retaliation. Although it is difficult for an outsider to understand either the breadth or the intensity of the conflict between Ms. Schuyler and Council, I accept the evidence that Council felt that she had overstepped her bounds. If nothing else, the decision to direct Ms. Schuyler not to attend the meetings of Council was a reflection of the increasingly hostile relationship between them. They simply couldn't work together.\n[134] It does not really matter how much one waters down the concept of retaliation. The simple question before me on the second complaint is whether the actions that the Band had taken against Ms. Schuyler, including the termination, were some form of retaliation. The evidence indicates otherwise. The idea that Council was paying her back when it dealt with personnel issues, complaints from staff, electoral issues, the healing lodge, the events surrounding the occupation and sit-in, and a host of other matters, is simply not credible.\n[135] I accordingly accept the position that the Respondent has put forward in its written submissions:\nA breakdown in the relationship between the Complainant and the Respondent is evident through the evidence of both parties. As a result of the deteriorating relationship, the Complainant's employment was terminated for cause.\nAnd elsewhere:\nThe Complainant was ultimately terminated from her employment for failing to meet the ongoing requirements of her position and for a clear breakdown in the relationship between the Complainant and the Respondent.\nI say this without deciding any of the employment issues, which are out of my reach.\nV. REMEDIES [136] There are a number of issues relating to remedy. Two are exceptional.\nA. Preliminary issues (i) Offer of settlement [137] Mr. Peters says the hearing was unnecessary. He says this because there was an offer of settlement, which in his eyes was sufficient to resolve the matter. The submission is that this should be taken into account, in determining the amount of any compensation. This presumably includes the expenses of the hearing.\n[138] The evidence relating to the offer is fragmentary and really covers the employment claim. It is contained in a letter dated September 2nd, 2003, which offers Ms. Schuyler eleven months severance, in addition to statutory payments, in spite of the fact that she had been terminated for cause. I know very little if anything about the circumstances of the offer and the evidence was entered into evidence essentially by mistake. Ms. Schuyler did not have a lawyer.\n[139] Ms. Schuyler apparently rejected the offer. Mr. Peters nevertheless argues that the attached release refers specifically to any complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act. It accordingly constitutes an offer to settle--or includes an offer to settle--the human rights complaint. I think this is stretching.\n[140] There is a mechanism for settling complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act, however, which requires the approval of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It seems to me that it would be wrong to give effect to an attempt to settle a related employment matter, on a contractual basis, outside the Act, at least in the present circumstances, where the terms of the offer do not explicitly address the issue of discrimination.\n[141] It seems clear that the offer is primarily for loss of wages, rather than pain and suffering. The offer might be relevant, if Ms. Schuyler was seeking lost wages. She has relinquished that claim, however. I am also satisfied that the offer does not meet the requirements of the law of costs, which requires a very explicit communication that the offer will be relied upon, in dealing with costs. Having considered the matter, I do not think that it would be fair or appropriate to consider the offer of settlement, in dealing with the issue of remedy.\n(ii) The Respondent's request for costs [142] There is another exceptional matter that needs consideration: the Respondent has also asked for costs against the CHRC. The Tribunal is a statutory body, however, with the powers granted to it by statute, and it is not clear to me that I have the jurisdiction to award these costs.\n[143] The policy factors that come into play in the case of Complainants do not apply to Respondents. I think it is apparent in the caselaw that the Canadian Human Rights Act contemplates a process in which Complainants can pursue their complaints without fear of being penalized by costs. The purpose of the Act is to encourage complainants to come forward.\n[144] Although I think that it is unfair to deny a Respondent costs, in a case where the complaint is vexatious and without any merit, the power to award costs is a statutory power. I think it is generally agreed that Parliament consciously decided, in passing the Canadian Human Rights Act, not to give Respondents the right to costs. This would therefore require an amendment to the Act.\n[145] The situation is compounded by the fact that the CHRC did not appear before the Tribunal and has not had an opportunity to respond to the Respondent's request. Perhaps it is sufficient if I say that I do not see anything in the facts before me that would justify such an extraordinary award, even if they were available under the Act. I have no view as to whether these kinds of costs might be recovered in other ways.\nB. Ms. Schuyler's claims (i) Lost wages [146] Ms. Schuyler originally claimed her income from the day that she lost the job to the day that the decision was made. She also wanted some form of compensation for loss of opportunity. She has now found work with the Union of Ontario Indians, however, and abandoned these claims at the end of the hearing.\n(ii) Pain and Suffering [147] The major claim is for pain and suffering. I accept that Ms. Schuyler has suffered, and keenly, from the discrimination.\n[148] There is a personal and a social side to the pain and suffering that Ms. Schuyler experienced. The initial actions of the Respondent were inconsiderate and did not exhibit the tact and understanding that the situation required. Ms. Schuyler had gone through a life and death experience. She was also entitled to a certain deference, on the employment side, as the Chief Administrator. The experience was that much harder, given Ms. Schuyler's age and the physical tribulations that went with the cancer.\n[149] In her written submissions, she mentions the fact that the stress she experienced in May, 2002 had an adverse effect on the chemotherapy she was receiving. I have no doubt that it did: it clearly had an adverse effect on everything that she experienced. I also think that she is entitled to some form of compensation for her loss of dignity, which was palpable. She described the process as `peeling off her skin piece by piece', which left her feeling completely vulnerable.\n[150] There were the family issues that went with this. There was a real loss of social status. She discovered later that other people in the Band thought that she had done something wrong and was fired. She still feels uncomfortable going out because she thinks people look at her sideways, or walk the other way when she comes near them. Counsel for the Respondent pointed out that there is no objective evidence of this, but I do not think he meant to question Ms. Schuyler's feelings.\na) Contributory conduct [151] All of this comes with two qualifications. The first is that the emotions that arose out of the employment issues are another matter. I can only estimate, in some rough manner, what she experienced as a result of the discrimination.\n[152] The second qualification is that there was an element of antagonism in Ms. Schuyler's conduct. There is no way out of this: she must bear some of the responsibility for the hostile relationship that developed between herself and the Band. The attitude on both sides was antagonistic. Ms. Schuyler was quick to retain a lawyer and threaten legal action.\n[153] There are political issues that Ms. Schuyler raised with respect to first nations. There is no doubt that she found herself caught up in a political struggle of some sort, within the Oneida Nation. The parties took a fundamentally different view of the responsibilities of the Chief Administrator and Band Council. This was exacerbated by personal enmity on both sides. These antipathies exhibited themselves, by all accounts, in indifference, political intrigue and even contempt.\n[154] It is hard to find dignity and understanding on either side. I am at a loss to find any real excuse for this. I was impressed by the testimony of Chief Doxtator, who I am sure understands the situation better than I do. It seems to me that the parties failed to respect the fact that our dignity rests, ultimately, on the recognition that every person has value and deserves an equal measure of esteem, whatever disagreements may arise. This idea is enshrined in the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nb) CHRC [155] There is another issue that arises in the context of pain and suffering. The most troubling fact is that Ms. Schuyler blamed the Canadian Human Rights Commission for much of her experience. She apparently feels betrayed by the CHRC and feels that it should not have left her to fight the litigation on her own. She testified that she had to relive her ordeal on nights and weekends, in preparing for the case. This was extremely difficult, she said. It is just as bad as going through the cancer. In many ways, I think it's worse. I survived the cancer. It will take a lot longer to survive this.\n[156] There is very little I can say about this aspect of the matter. I have not heard from the CHRC, and the Tribunal has no authority, as far as I am aware, to require that the CHRC appear. The more important observation, as Mr. Peters submitted, is that the Respondent cannot be held responsible for Ms. Schuyler's experience in preparing for the hearing. The Respondent was entitled to defend itself; and Ms. Schuyler acknowledged that it did so, in a difficult set of circumstances, without further injuring her dignity.\nc) Conclusion [157] In all the circumstances, having taken everything into consideration, Ms. Schuyler is awarded four thousand dollars for pain and suffering. This amount has been discounted, to reflect the contributory element in her conduct.\n(iii) Willful and reckless conduct [158] Ms. Schuyler has also asked for damages under s. 53(3) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which allows the Tribunal to award additional compensation if the member finds that the person engaging in the discriminatory practice did so willfully and recklessly. Ms. Schuyler is asking for the maximum award of twenty thousand dollars.\n[159] The discrimination that occurred in the present case was regretful. It was not, however, of the magnitude that is regularly seen in many cases. The Band at least went through the exercise contemplated by the Act. It also seems to me that the claim for compensation under s. 53(3) comes primarily out of the allegation of retaliation, which has been dismissed.\n[160] The present case was an employment matter that boiled over, into other issues. The hostilities between the parties had an extravagant side, but I am satisfied that any egregious conduct can be ascribed to the ongoing employment dispute. This is not what the Act covers. Section 53(3) contemplates a situation in which the willful and reckless conduct is found in the discrimination, rather than a collateral dispute.\n(iv) Posting the decision [161] Ms. Schuyler has asked that my decision be posted in some prominent place. The Respondent says that the Tribunal has no power to order such a posting.\n[162] Mr. Peters submits that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is a creature of statute. Any authority that it enjoys in this regard must therefore be found in the Canadian Human Rights Act. The only relevant provision appears to be s. 53(2)(a), which states that the Tribunal can order that the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice:\n... cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future ...\nMr. Peters says that there is nothing in this that gives the Tribunal the authority to order that a decision be posted in a prominent place.\n[163] The authority to order that the Respondent post the decision must be found, if it is found anywhere, in the first part of this provision, which states that the Tribunal may order that the Respondent cease the discriminatory practice. The question of statutory interpretation accordingly reduces itself to the question whether a direction that the decision be posted comes within the scope of an order to cease the discriminatory practice.\n[164] I think it does. The Canadian Human Rights Act is remedial. It deals with matters of fundamental importance and should be interpreted in a large and liberal manner. It is usually said that the purpose of the remedies provided under the Act are to make the victim whole. I think this applies as much to the emotional and psychological state of the victim, as anything else. The posting of the decision will help to alleviate some of the isolation and exclusion that Ms. Schuyler has experienced as a result of the discrimination.\n[165] There is another side to this: the evidence before me clearly indicates that the events surrounding Ms. Schuyler's complaint and subsequent dismissal were of public interest within the Band. I think Ms. Schuyler has every right to be concerned for her reputation and want to set the record straight. The decision has not come out entirely in her favour, but an order to post the decision will at least provide everyone with an impartial account of the issues that have arisen between Ms. Schuyler and the Band.\n[166] Then there is the fact that the public posting of the decision serves an educational purpose. I draw support for this conclusion from Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84, where La Forest J. stated that the Canadian Human Rights Act embodies educational objectives. I note that he then states, at para. 15, that one of the purposes of the Act is to educate people in specific workplaces:\nMore importantly, the interpretation I have proposed makes education begin in the workplace, in the micro-democracy of the work environment, rather than in society at large.\nThis holds true, in the immediate case, both with respect to band administration and with respect to the larger democratic process on the reserve.\n[167] There is also the decision of the Supreme Court in CN v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114, often cited as Action Travail des Femmes. There, Chief Justice Dickson wrote, at p. 1134, that the Canadian Human Rights Act should be interpreted in a way that gives the rights enunciated in the Act:\n...their full recognition and effect. We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights and to enfeeble their proper impact.\nI believe that Robichaud and Action Travail des Femmes can be read together in the immediate context.\n[168] It is notable that the decision in Action Travail des Femmes speaks of the impact of the rights enshrined in the Canadian Human Rights Act. I think the word impact includes the social impact of a decision. The complaints in the present case arose in a specific community, which has a collective interest in the decision and needs to be advised of the situation. There is nothing one-sided in this: both parties have had a measure of success in the litigation and I do not see what the Respondent has to fear from such a direction.\n[169] I have found one decision that might seem to go in a different direction. In Chopra v. Health Canada 2004 CHRT 27 (which was reviewed in the Federal Court and is now on appeal, but on other grounds), the Tribunal rejected a request for an order that the Respondent post its decision, at para. 62, across the country via electronic mail to all employees of the department. I think the situation before me is quite different, however. Ms. Schuyler is not asking for a mass e-mailing to a host of strangers, scattered across the entire country.\n[170] At the same time, I do not think it is practical to post the entire decision. I accordingly order the Respondent to post an announcement in reasonably large letters on the main bulletin board in the Administration Building, or some equally prominent place, advising Band members that a decision has been rendered by the Tribunal. The notice shall state that copies of the decision are available at the front counter or some convenient place. There shall be no charge for the copies.\n(v) Policy review [171] Ms. Schuyler also wants the Canadian Human Rights Commission to do a policy review and negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding with the Band to set up a process to resolve any human rights issues. She wants a human rights advocate appointed. And an independent appeal process.\n[172] I note that Chairperson Mactavish dealt with a similar situation in Nkwazi v. Correctional Service Canada T.D. 1\/01 2001\/02\/05, at paras. 274-275, where she wrote:\n[274] Ms. Nkwazi seeks an order that [Correctional Service Canada] take measures, in consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, to prevent such discriminatory practices from occurring in the future. While CSC does have policies and procedures in place which are designed to address workplace discrimination and harassment, it is evident from the way in which Ms. Nkwazi's complaints were dealt with by [Regional Psychiatric Centre] management that there is work to be done in this area. As a result, I order CSC to consult with the Commission with respect to its anti-discrimination and harassment policies, procedures and employee education programs, and to take measures to prevent the same or similar practices from occurring in the future.\n[173] The situation before me is notably different, however, since the evidence suggests that the discrimination against Ms. Schuyler was a product of the specific circumstances relating to Ms. Schuyler. There is no real evidence of systemic discrimination or larger issues.\n[174] There is the additional problem, as Madam Mactavish notes, that the Tribunal does not appear to have the authority to order the Commission to participate in such a process. There is still a mechanism in the Canadian Human Rights Act that the Respondent may avail itself of, if it wishes to consult with the CHRC. It would certainly be commendable if the Respondent did so. I am not, however, prepared to grant the kind of order that Ms. Schuyler is requesting.\n(vi) Costs and expenses [175] Ms. Schuyler has also asked for costs. This is complicated by two facts. The first is that she retained a lawyer to deal with the employment aspects of the matter, which were handled separately. She has discounted her request, in order to reflect this. The second fact, however, is that she is claiming costs for services that were rendered before the Commission. I do not think that she is entitled to these costs.\n[176] In Brooks v. Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 2005 CHRT 26 (2005\/07\/12), at para. 39, I held that any power that the Tribunal enjoys in awarding costs must be restricted to the Tribunal process. That decision has since been reviewed, without dealing with this precise issue. I also discussed the case law in Brown v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 30 (2004\/09\/01). I do not see anything in the circumstances before me that would justify revisiting the issue. In the circumstances, there is no need to deal with the more fundamental question whether the Tribunal has the power to award costs, which is apparently on its way to the Court of Appeal.\n[177] There are still the fees that Ms. Schuyler incurred in consulting a lawyer, in 2002, when she was seeking accommodation. This comes within a recognized exception in the law of costs and can be characterized as expenses under s. 53(1)(d) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. She is also entitled to disbursements, for transportation, copying, etc., related to the complaint. Rather than open the door to a further dispute between the parties, I think it is better to award a lump sum of six hundred dollars, which in my view constitutes a reasonable amount for these expenses.\n(vii) Remaining matters [178] It is for the parties to decide whether they wish to submit a written order. If that is the case, I would suggest that it may be more convenient for the Respondent to draft the order, since Ms. Schuyler is not represented by a lawyer. She would naturally be welcome to review the draft of any order with a lawyer of her choice.\n[179] The compensation and expenses that I have awarded shall be paid within thirty days of the expiry of any period of review or appeal. I will retain jurisdiction to deal with any outstanding matters.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario August 18, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILES: T980\/10004 and T1014\/13404\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Karen Schuyler v.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] George Vilven has filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated August 5, 2004, alleging that Air Canada has discriminated against him on the ground of age, contrary to ss. 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] By application dated June 29, 2006, Air Canada Pilots Association applied to the Tribunal for interested party status.\n[3] The Commission, the Complainant (with a caveat) and Air Canada consent to this application.\n[4] The Tribunal also received an application dated June 20, 2006, from Fly Past 60 Coalition, a group of pilots or former pilots of Air Canada, asking to be added as an interested party to the complaint.\n[5] The Commission consented to the application by the Fly Past 60 Coalition. Air Canada opposed it as did ACPA. ACPA did not feel in any way constrained in opposing the Coalition's application even though it has no status or standing to do so.\n[6] I have reviewed the two applications and the responses of the parties to the complaint. I have concluded that ACPA should be added as an interested party. It is a signatory to the collective agreement with Air Canada which contains provisions relating the mandatory retirement of Air Canada pilots. As such, it has an obvious interest in these proceedings.\n[7] I've also concluded that Fly Past 60 Coalition should be added as an interested party. In this regard, I refer to and adopt the reasoning of Commission counsel in his letter of July 12, 2006 setting out the reasons why the Commission supports the Coalition's application.\n[8] Both ACPA and the Fly Past 60 Coalition will be permitted to fully participate in the hearing of this complaint before the Tribunal, including the introduction of evidence and cross-examination of witnesses, to the extent that such participation is not duplicative of the evidence and submissions of the Commission, the Complainant or Air Canada.\n[9] The schedule for disclosure for the Complainant, the Commission and Air Canada will remain the same. The schedule for APCA and Coalition disclosure will be as set out in their applications. Any request for changes in the disclosure schedules will be dealt with at the conference call on September 8, 2006.\nSigned by\nJ.

Hadjis\n[1] During a case management conference call held on June 21, 2006, the Canadian Forces Grievance Board (the Board) raised concerns about the sufficiency of Me Micheline Montreuil's summary regarding the anticipated testimony of her witness, Pierre Lacasse. Consequently, Me Montreuil prepared a more detailed summary, which she provided to the Board shortly thereafter. On July 11, 2006, the Board informed the Tribunal that in its view, the amended summary of Mr. Lacasse's testimony was still insufficient.\n[2] In this amended summary, which is about 20 lines long, Me Montreuil explains that Mr. Lacasse will testify that he is a retired member of the military who worked for the Board on a contractual basis until November 2003. He will testify that he heard two Board managers (whose names are specified in the summary) making disparaging remarks regarding Me Montreuil, which included comments to the effect that she would not be hired because she is a transgendered person and that it would be hard to imagine a transgendered person working as a grievance officer. According to the summary, Mr. Lacasse will also testify that he has never met nor is he related to Me Montreuil. He will also give evidence that it was he who contacted Me Montreuil to inform her of the conversation that he had heard.\n[3] The Board alleges that the summary is insufficient because the following details are lacking:\nWhat was the context of the conversation?\nWho was present and who took part in the conversation?\nTo whom were the remarks made?\nHow many times were the remarks made and on what date(s)?\nWhere were the remarks made?\nWhere was Mr. Lacasse when he heard the remarks?\n[4] The Board claims that it will be unable to prepare its defence without answers to these questions.\n[5] The summary of anticipated testimony forms part of the Statement of Particulars that each party is required to prepare and file pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. Aside from this summary, the Statement of Particulars must contain a list of documents to be disclosed, and set out the material facts that the party seeks to prove in support of its case, as well as its position on the legal issues raised and the relief that the party is seeking, if applicable.\n[6] As the Tribunal noted in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Northwest Territories (Minister of Personnel), [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 9 (C.H.R.T.)(QL) at para. 7, a party is only entitled to the material facts on which the opposing party is relying in pleading its case. The party filing its Statement of Particulars is not required to plead its evidence at this stage. This principle would logically extend, in my view, to the summaries of testimonies that form part of a Statement of Particulars. As the Tribunal went on to state, the rationale behind the procedure of filing Statements of Particulars is to clarify the issues in the case and establish the case that the other parties must meet in presenting their own evidence.\n[7] In the present case, the details provided in Me Montreuil's amended summary are more than sufficient to inform the Board of the case it must meet. The Board has been put on notice that Mr. Lacasse will testify that he heard two named managers speak of Me Montreuil in disparaging terms to the effect that she would not be hired due to her transgendered status.\n[8] It would appear from the Board's written submissions on its motion that its concerns regarding the sufficiency of Me Montreuil's summary are rooted in the fact that the two named managers who allegedly engaged in the conversation deny having any recollection of any such discussion.\n[9] I fail to see how this has any bearing on the matter before me. It is hardly unheard of for two opposing parties to have contradictory recollections of events. This is precisely why hearings are held and why tribunals are called upon to render decisions after hearing all of the evidence. It is important to not lose sight of the fact that Me Montreuil has the ultimate burden of proving her case, with evidence that may include Mr. Lacasse's testimony regarding the alleged conversation. If the Board, based on the word of its employees, believes it has grounds to question the accuracy or veracity of Mr. Lacasse's evidence, it can explore these questions through its cross examination of this witness.\n[10] I therefore see no reason to order Me Montreuil to provide further details regarding the proposed testimony of Mr. Lacasse. The Board's motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D. Hadjis\nOTTAWA, Ontario August 25, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T1108\/8905\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Micheline Montreuil v.

INTRODUCTION\nII. FACTS\nIII. LEGAL BACKGROUN\nIV. ANALYSIS\nA. Calculation of the SMLB\nB. Reimbursement of sick leave\nV. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Dannie Bertnatchez (hereinafter the complainant) taught at the \u00c9cole Olamen located in La Romaine on the Lower North Shore. The Council of the Montagnais de Unamen Shipu (hereinafter the respondent) is responsible for the \u00c9cole Olamen. From August 25, 2003 to December 27, 2003 (a period of 18 weeks), the complainant was on maternity leave, followed by parental leave until June 21, 2004. During her maternity leave, the complainant received supplementary maternity leave benefits (hereinafter SMLB) from the respondent.\n[2] The complainant submits that the respondent discriminated against her by refusing to calculate her annual salary for the purposes of the SMLB on the basis of daily remuneration equivalent to 1\/200 of her annual remuneration. The respondent used daily remuneration equivalent to 1\/260 of her annual remuneration to make the calculation. Furthermore, the complainant contests the respondent's refusal to pay her an amount equivalent to the unused sick days accumulated during her maternity leave. She submits that these refusals contravene section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act1 (hereinafter the Act) because they have the effect of disadvantaging her during her employment on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, namely sex.\n[3] At the hearing, the complainant was represented by counsel, as was the respondent. The Commission did not appear. Three witnesses were heard: for the complainant, she herself and another teacher, Marie-Jos\u00e9e Chamberland. The respondent called R\u00e9jean Laberge, Director of Educational Services in the respondent's employ.\nII. FACTS [4] The complainant has been employed by the respondent since September 1998. She teaches students at the secondary level. Since August 1999, the complainant has been considered to be a regular full-time teacher. The complainant explained that, as a regular full-time teacher, she is paid for 200 days of work corresponding to 40 weeks. Since regular teachers are not eligible for employment insurance during the summer period, it was agreed with the respondent that the annual salary of the regular teachers would be spread over 26 pay periods (260 days) to enable them to receive a salary during the summer period.\n[5] During the 2003-2004 school year, the complainant began her maternity leave on August 25, 2003, followed by parental leave from December 29, 2003 to June 21, 2004. During her maternity leave (18 weeks), the complainant received from the respondent SMLBs equivalent to 93% of her annual salary based on 26 pay periods minus the maternity benefits paid by employment insurance. At the end of her parental leave, the complainant returned to work on June 22 and 23, 2004. For each of these two days, she was paid by the respondent on a basis of 1\/200 of her annual salary rather than one of 1\/260. The complainant did not receive remuneration from the respondent during the summer of 2004.\n[6] The complainant explained that the only policy of the respondent brought to her attention throughout her employment was the [TRANSLATION] Personnel Policy of the \u00c9cole Olamen in la Romaine-May 2001 (hereinafter the May 2001 school policy).\n[7] In her testimony, the complainant spoke about her meetings and telephone conversations during 2003-2004 with the respondent's Director of Educational Services, R\u00e9jean Laberge. He represents the respondent with respect to the application of the policies concerning the conditions of employment. First of all, she had to clarify with Mr. Laberge the annual basic salary used to calculate the SMLB. Mr. Laberge admitted that this salary was $57,960 and not $57,860. Second, the complainant requested that the SMLB be paid to her during the waiting period imposed by employment insurance, that is weeks 1 and 2 and the last week of her maternity leave. The respondent acceded to the complainant's request. The complainant also asked Mr. Laberge to have the respondent give her the SMLB on an annual salary based on daily remuneration calculated on 200 days rather than on 260 days. According to the complainant's testimony, Mr. Laberge told her that he accepted her request. One month later, however, the complainant received a letter from Mr. Laberge denying her request. In this letter, Mr. Laberge explained to the complainant that he refused to pay her the equivalent of the sick days accumulated during her maternity leave.\n[8] The second witness heard for the complainant was Marie-Jos\u00e9e Chamberland, a regular full-time teacher with the respondent since September 2000. In her testimony, she stated that the only policy of the respondent brought to her attention was the May 2001 school policy. She testified that in August 2004, Mr. Laberge informed the employees that the respondent had decided to no longer give the SMLB during 2004-2005. On that occasion, he gave all the employees a copy of the respondent's new policy. This policy was not filed in evidence.\n[9] For the respondent, the only witness heard was R\u00e9jean Laberge. He has been in the respondent's employ since January 2001. Between January 2001 and September 2003, he held the office of school principal. In September 2003, he combined the duties of school principal and that of Director of Educational Services. Since January 2004, Mr. Laberge's duties have been exclusively those of the Director of Educational Services. In this capacity, Mr. Laberge is responsible for the application of the policies governing conditions of employment.\n[10] Mr. Laberge explained that the reference document concerning the conditions of employment of all the respondent's employees is the [TRANSLATION] Personnel Policy of the Council of the Innu of Unamen-Shipu dated November 2001 (hereinafter the November 2001 Council policy). When he assumed his duties as Director of Educational Services in September 2003, his predecessor's Assistant Director of Educational Services gave him the [TRANSLATION] Personnel Policy of the \u00c9cole Olamen-March 2003 (hereinafter the March 2003 school policy). The witness stated that prior to the March 2003 policy, there had been another policy entitled [TRANSLATION] \u00c9cole Olamen Policy-May 2002 (hereinafter the May 2002 school policy). It emerged from Mr. Laberge's testimony that there was a school policy and a Council policy, which applied to all the employees of the respondent. The school policy he applied in the complainant's case was the policy dated March 2003.\n[11] In his testimony, Mr. Laberge stated that, prior to the complainant's maternity leave, two other teachers received SMLB and he applied the same calculation, that is 93% of their annual salary over 260 days.\n[12] Concerning the sick leave, Mr. Laberge explained his refusal as follows:\nQ. [Jos\u00e9 Rondeau]: So, in the same way, the claim for sick days, what was your reason for refusing it?\nThere cannot be any sick leave that can be converted into pay, you cannot accumulate sick leave if you have not worked. Someone who is on unpaid leave does not accumulate any sick leave.\nIII. LEGAL BACKGROUND [13] Section 3 of the Act includes sex as a prohibited ground of discrimination while stating: Where the ground of discrimination is pregnancy or child-birth, the discrimination shall be deemed to be on the ground of sex. The Supreme Court of Canada recognized a situation of discrimination in employment based on pregnancy in its decision in Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd.2 In that case, the Court found that it was discriminatory for the wage insurance plan in effect at the employer to deprive pregnant employees of disability benefits for seventeen weeks beginning in the tenth week preceding the expected week of the birth and ending in the sixth week following the birth.\n[14] It is not necessary for the discriminatory considerations to be the only reason for the alleged actions in order for a finding to be made that there was a basis for the complaint. It is sufficient for the discrimination to have been one of the factors on which the respondent's decision was based.3\n[15] It is the responsibility of the person claiming to be discriminated against in terms of his or her human rights to establish this fact before the tribunal. According to Ontario (Ontario Human Rights Commission) v. Etobicoke (Municipality), a complainant must establish... a prima facie case of discrimination.4. O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd. states that this prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.5\n[16] In Canada (Minister of National Defence) v. Mongrain,6 the Federal Court of Appeal states that it is not sufficient for the complainant to assert that he or she has reasonable grounds to believe that he or she is the victim of discrimination in order to shift the onus of proof to the respondent. The complainant must establish a prima facie case.\n[17] Once the prima facie case is established, the respondent has the onus of providing reasonable justification showing that the decision made concerning the complainant was not based on a prohibited ground of discrimination. The justification given must not be a mere pretext.7\nIV. ANALYSIS [18] There are two questions before the Tribunal. The first concerns the complainant's allegation that the respondent discriminated against her in refusing to calculate the SMLB on the basis of her annual remuneration divided by 200 days of work. More precisely, the complainant claims from the respondent: [TRANSLATION] 93% of the difference between my annual salary divided by 20 pay periods (200 days of work) and that divided by 26 pay periods (260 days), for 18 weeks.\n[19] The second question concerns the complainant's allegation that the respondent discriminated against her in refusing to give her an amount equivalent to the sick days accumulated during her maternity leave converted into cash. According to the complainant, she had accumulated 3.15 days of sick leave during her maternity leave.\n[20] First of all, the Tribunal will analyse the question concerning the calculation of the SMLB. Then, the Tribunal will examine the question of the sick leave.\nA. Calculation of the SMLB [21] It emerges from the evidence that the SMLB are given to regular employees who are eligible for employment insurance. The purpose of the SMLB, as set out in the school policies, is to [TRANSLATION] supplement employment insurance benefits during a temporary cessation of work caused solely by pregnancy. All the school's policies provide that the SMLB plan applies to [TRANSLATION] regular employees who become pregnant. Finally, all these policies contain the following statement:\nThe amount of the weekly benefits payable under the plan and the gross weekly employment insurance benefits correspond to 93% of the employee's usual remuneration.\n[22] In the complainant's view, the usual remuneration of a regular employee correspond to the provision of 200 days of work, the remuneration for which is extended over 26 pay periods. Again according to the complainant, in the case of a part-time employee, the remuneration is not extended over 26 pay periods. It is only the regular employees who, in order to ensure remuneration throughout the summer, agree to have their remuneration extended over 26 pay periods.\n[23] At the outset, the Tribunal finds that all the conditions governing the calculation of the SMLB are not expressly set out in the school policies. Besides the fact that all these policies state that the calculation of the SMLB corresponds to [TRANSLATION] 93% of the employee's usual remuneration, no indication is given as to whether this calculation must be divided by 20 or 26 weeks. However, all the school policies state that [TRANSLATION] the 1\/200-days calculation is used to determine the salary of part-time employees (May 2001 school policy) or to determine the salary of part-time or contract employees (May 2002 and March 2003 school policies). All the school policies acknowledge the suppletive nature of the Council's policies. In fact, these policies state:\nIn the event that there are organizational vacuums in this document, the General Policy of the Band Council shall have the force of law.\n[24] The November 2001 Council Policy provides the following for regular and casual employees:\nThe employee's remuneration is established on an annual basis reduced to a basis of two (2) weeks (or seventy (70) hours for full-time employees), by dividing the anticipated salary by a conversion factor of twenty-six (26).\n[25] Mr. Laberge, the representative of the respondent, wrote (Exhibit P-8) that the provision of the SMLB was discretionary. He repeated this point during his testimony. In the Tribunal's opinion, this statement has no impact on this case because the respondent agreed to pay the SMLB to the complainant.\n[26] The evidence shows that the representative of the respondent always considered the SMLB to be an accrued benefit of regular employees who were pregnant and that the compensation paid seemed to him to be [TRANSLATION] fair. The Tribunal notes that it does not have a duty to determine whether the respondent's decision to calculate the SMLB by dividing by 26 weeks is fair. The Tribunal must determine whether discrimination occurred. In order for this question to be answered in the affirmative, the complainant must establish a prima facie case that she was disadvantaged during her employment on a prohibited ground of discrimination, namely her pregnancy.\n[27] In this case, in order to determine whether the complainant was disadvantaged on a prohibited ground, a comparative analysis is required in order to ascertain whether the rule affects a person or group of persons differently from others to whom it may apply.8\n[28] Thus, the Tribunal must identify the group that is also affected by the same rule. The complainant submits that, as a regular employee, her situation must be compared with the group to which she belongs, that is the regular employees. In other words, according to the complainant, the following question must be asked: does the respondent, because of its method of calculating the SMLB, treat the complainant differently from the regular female employees who are not pregnant? In the complainant's view, the expression [TRANSLATION] usual remuneration used to calculate the SMLB must be compared with the definition of usual remuneration allowed and paid to regular employees who are not pregnant and who receive remuneration.\n[29] For its part, the respondent argues that the complainant's situation must be compared with that of an employee [TRANSLATION] who did not work. An employee is entitled to the residue (the overpayment deducted because of the extension of the remuneration over 26 weeks) only if he or she worked and solely for that part of the time that was worked. In the respondent's view, the complainant's situation must be likened to that of an employee on unpaid leave.\n[30] In Brooks, the group with which the complainants identified was all the employees covered by the employer's group insurance plan. As we noted earlier, this plan included selective coverage and excluded pregnant workers from weekly benefits in the case of loss of wages on account of illness and accident for a period of seventeen weeks. During these seventeen weeks, pregnant women could not receive any benefits even if they suffered from an illness quite unrelated to their pregnancy. The plan accordingly had the effect of treating pregnancy differently from other forms of inability to work linked to health problems. The Court stated:\nIncreasingly, employee benefit plans have become part of the terms and conditions of employment. Once an employer decides to provide an employee benefit package, exclusions from such schemes may not be made in a discriminatory fashion. Selective compensation of this nature would clearly amount to sex discrimination. Benefits available through employment must be disbursed in a non-discriminatory manner.9\n[31] In the instant case, the SMLB are a benefit intended exclusively for regular employees who are pregnant. Regular employees who are not pregnant are not subject to the rule of the SMLB. In Brooks, the rule excluding pregnant women was contained in a health insurance plan that applied to all the employees. The facts in this case are different.\n[32] In the judgment of the Tribunal, beyond the interpretation that may be given to the words [TRANSLATION] usual remuneration, it is necessary above all to determine whether, when the complainant receives the SMLB, she must be considered to be an employee on paid or unpaid leave. Only once this has been determined can the Tribunal determine whether the complainant may properly refer to the regular employees who are not pregnant and who receive remuneration as a comparison group.\n[33] A reading of all the school policies filed in evidence shows that the SMLB are described as benefits and not as salary or remuneration. Certainly, benefits are calculated on the [TRANSLATION] usual remuneration but this does not mean that they constitute remuneration or that they must be likened to salary or remuneration. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the SMLB are designed to make up for a lack of remuneration for maternity leave, but this does not mean that the SMLB can be described as remuneration.\n[34] Furthermore, all the school policies also use the words [TRANSLATION] maternity leave allowance to describe the SMLB. Once again, the word remuneration or salary is not used.\n[35] In Dumont-Ferlatte,10 the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal dismissed the claim of employees of the Public Service of Canada alleging discrimination on the basis of sex on the ground that annual leave and sick leave was not credited to them and that they were not paid monthly bilingual bonuses during their maternity leave. In that case, the complainants alleged that the SMLB received were remuneration. Consequently, according to the complainants, for the purpose of establishing the appropriate comparison group, they had to be regarded as being on paid maternity leave. The Tribunal found that the SMLB did not constitute remuneration and that whether or not there was discrimination had to be analysed by comparing the consequences attached to the different types of unpaid leave. The Tribunal stated:\nThe very essence of a contract of employment is a direct relationship between earnings or remuneration and the performance of work. When she is on maternity leave, however, a pregnant woman is not performing work for her employer and cannot receive remuneration.11\n(...)\nSince a pregnant woman is unable, by reason of her absence on maternity leave, to perform work for which she would receive remuneration, the maternity allowance paid by the employer serves to make good the unfavorable situation in which she finds herself and does not constitute remuneration.12\n[36] In the opinion of this Tribunal, that decision applies to the facts in the instant case. It should be noted that the decision in Dumont-Ferlatte was the subject of judicial review in the Federal Court of Canada Trial Division. Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer dismissed the application. In paragraph 46 of the judgment, she stated:\nThe evidence given before the Tribunal was that maternity leave is a form of leave without pay. Since no work is done because of maternity, the employee receives no pay. Accordingly, the Tribunal was correct to compare maternity leave with the other forms of leave without pay provided for in the collective agreement, including paternity leave without pay, adoption leave without pay, leave without pay for the care and nurturing of pre-school age children, leave without pay for relocation of spouse, leave without pay for personal needs, sick leave without pay, leave without pay for education and training, military leave without pay, leave without pay to participate in the activities of an international organization, leave without pay to run in an election and leave without pay for union activities.13\n[37] Thus, the Tribunal finds that the complainant must be considered to have been on unpaid leave. The complainant cannot be compared with regular employees who are not pregnant and are not on unpaid leave. This is not the appropriate comparison group.\n[38] In the instant case, it is also necessary to consider the fact that the complainant did not do any work. In Cramm v. Canadian National Railway Co.,14 the Human Rights Appeal Tribunal stated:\nIn our view, the reasoning in Dumont-Ferlatte is also more consistent with the essential nature of the employment contract. To reiterate: the employer's obligation to pay is conditional upon work being performed. There is no general obligation on employers to compensate employees who are not providing services.15\n[39] The decision in Cramm was the subject of an application for judicial review, which was dismissed. In that decision, Justice MacKay stated:\nThe Commission urged that the Review Tribunal erred by considering the nature of the employment contract in coming to the conclusion that there was no prima facie case of discrimination. That was done in assessing the purposes of ESIMA, an assessment essential in considering the purpose of employment related rules, in accord with the process established in Gibbs. In my opinion, the nature of the rule in question, based on the underlying principle of an employment contract that one is paid for service performed, is an essential element in assessing the purpose of the rule in question...16\n[40] The complainant did not receive SMLB from the respondent in consideration of any work that was done. The regular employees are not therefore in the same situation as the complainant, the reason being that their remuneration is consideration for work that is done. To be sure, a regular employee who leaves in the middle of the school year will be entitled to reimbursement of the amount that was deducted to ensure that the payment was extended over 26 weeks. However, the calculation of the excessive amounts deducted is in consideration of the work done, for which X remuneration was paid. In the instant case, the Tribunal may not compare the complainant's situation with that of the regular employees who were not pregnant and who did work.\n[41] Thus, the Tribunal finds that the complainant has not established a prima facie case showing that the respondent discriminated against her because of her pregnancy.\nB. Reimbursement of sick leave [42] Concerning this aspect of the complaint, the complainant considers that the respondent discriminated against her by refusing to reimburse her for the sick leave accumulated during her absence on maternity leave. The complainant relies on the May 2001 school policy. This policy provides as follows:\n22.1 An employee on maternity leave shall retain her days of sick leave and shall remain covered by the insurance plan in effect.\n[43] In the respondent's view, the May 2001 school policy submitted by the complainant does not apply. The respondent submits that the policy in effect at the time the complainant exercised her right to take maternity leave was the March 2003 school policy. Article 22.1 is no longer included in this or the earlier policy, namely the May 2002 school policy.\n[44] Consequently, the respondent no longer recognizes an employee on maternity leave as having the right to convert the sick leave she accumulates during her absence into cash.\n[45] In the complainant's view, it is the May 2001 school policy that applies since the respondent never communicated the March 2003 and May 2002 school policies to her.\n[46] This having been said, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is to determine whether, by refusing to reimburse her for the sick leave accumulated during her maternity leave, the respondent discriminated against the complainant. First, the Tribunal must ascertain whether there is a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[47] It emerges from the evidence that the respondent justified its refusal to reimburse the complainant for the accumulated sick leave because, in the respondent's view, the May 2001 school policy no longer applied (Exhibit P-11, p. 3). It is established that the complainant never received a copy of the May 2002 and March 2003 school policies. Assuming that the respondent was required to apply the May 2001 school policy to the complainant because it had not notified the complainant that it no longer applied, the Tribunal cannot conclude that there was a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[48] The respondent's refusal to apply the May 2001 school policy does not in itself create a prima facie case of discrimination against the complainant. To be sure, there was a misunderstanding between the parties as to whether the respondent's decision to apply a policy that was never communicated to the complainant was correct. However, the Tribunal cannot link this misunderstanding and the prohibited ground of discrimination that is pregnancy.\n[49] Despite what has been said above and assuming that the complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, the Tribunal considers that all the evidence adduced does not show that the respondent discriminated against the complainant. In his letter to the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Exhibit I-3), the representative of the respondent stated that a provision allowed them to amend a policy before the beginning of each school year. The May 2002 and March 2003 school policies contained such a provision. The May 2001 school policy stated the following: [TRANSLATION] This policy may be amended by the Council in office. The respondent accordingly reserved the right to amend the May 2001 school policy. It did so when it reviewed and amended this policy on two occasions. Consequently, the respondent's refusal to apply the May 2001 school policy is not a pretext and is a reasonable explanation.\n[50] Concerning the respondent's refusal to acknowledge that it was possible for a regular employee who was pregnant to convert the sick leave accumulated during her maternity leave into cash, the Tribunal analysed the testimony of the representative of the respondent and the letter he sent to the complainant (Exhibit P-8). From this evidence, the Tribunal understands that when the representative of the respondent wrote to the complainant (Exhibit P-8) and answered the questions of Jos\u00e9 Rondeau, counsel for the complainant, concerning the sick leave, he referred to the policy he felt was applicable, that is the March 2003 school policy. The reason why this March 2003 school policy no longer recognized this benefit lies in the fact that, according to the representative of the respondent, employees on maternity leave are considered to be on unpaid leave. Since they do not work, employees on unpaid leave cannot accumulate sick leave during their absence. In the Tribunal's judgment, the decision in Dumont-Ferlatte17 confirms the correctness of such a justification.\n[51] Certainly, the respondent could have maintained the benefit recognized in article 22.1 of the May 2001 school policy. However, the decision to remove this benefit and the reasons given in support of its removal constitute a reasonable explanation that was not a pretext.\n[52] Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the complainant did not establish a prima facie case of discrimination and that, if she had done so, the respondent gave a reasonable explanation that was not a pretext or contrary to the Act.\nV.

Grant Sinclair\n[1] In her motion dated July 24, 2006, the Complainant, Kathleen Moore, asked that her complaint be amended to add allegations of discrimination under ss. 10 and 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. As to the section 14.1 amendment, the Respondent's position is that it does not oppose but does not consent to this amendment. The facts alleged in support demonstrate that the criteria for such an amendment, as enunciated in many Tribunal rulings, are satisfied. Accordingly, the complaint is amended to add the allegations under s. 14.1 of the Act.\n[2] In opposing the s. 10 amendment request, the Respondent first argues that, under s. 51 of the Act, it is the Commission that is the guardian of the public interest. Only the Commission, and not an individual complainant, can put forward allegations of systemic discrimination under s. 10 and seek a systemic remedy under s. 53(2)(a) of the Act. The Commission has withdrawn from these proceedings and did not seek such an amendment.\n[3] The Respondent also relies on the Tribunal's ruling in Toth and Canadian Human Rights Commission v. the Kitchener Aero Avionics, 2005 CHRT 19, specifically the reasoning of the Tribunal in paragraph 37 of its decision. In this paragraph, the Tribunal noted that the remedies sought by the Complainant are personal and compensatory and do not engage the larger public interest.\n[4] In dealing with the public interest argument, it is not necessary to define public interest as found in s. 51 of the Act. It suffices to say that s. 51 says nothing about an individual complainant's standing to file a complaint alleging a systemic discriminatory practice. In fact, s. 40 of the Act expressly allows an individual or group of individuals to file a complaint with the Commission. This section does not preclude an individual systemic complaint.\n[5] Nor is there anything in s. 53(2)(a) of the Act which constrains the Tribunal in granting a systemic remedy where the complainant is an individual and not the Commission. When the Tribunal is constrained in awarding the full range of remedies under s. 53, it is expressly provided for in the Act. An example of this is s. 54(1).\n[6] Turning now to Toth, the Tribunal had to decide a res judicata motion, not a motion to add s. 10 to the complaint. In my opinion, the Tribunal's comments in paragraph 37 must be read in the context of the particular facts of that case and is distinguishable from the present case.\n[7] Even if Toth may be read as limiting a complainant to a personal and compensatory remedy, it conflicts with the Tribunal ruling in Aleta Gaucher and Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1.\n[8] In Gaucher, the Commission sought to amend a complaint to add a s. 10 allegation. The Tribunal concluded that no amendment was necessary, but granted the amendment to clarify, as it said, the legalities of the situation. The Tribunal reasoned (in paragraph 15) that s. 53(2)(a) of the Act does not distinguish between the private and the systemic aspects of a complaint and it is a mistake to draw a dichotomy between complaints under s. 7 and s. 10 of the Act.\n[9] I am not bound by the Toth decision and I prefer the Tribunal reasoning in Gaucher. It is a case that involves the same question as this case.\n[10] For these reasons, I have concluded that the Complainant in this case may, within the framework of her current complaint, allege that the Respondent has engaged in systemic discriminatory practices and may claim a systemic remedy. She can do this without amendment to her complaint. Of course, it is up to the Tribunal hearing the complaint to determine whether or not such allegations can be sustained and if so, whether a systemic remedy is the appropriate remedy in the circumstances.\n[11] I would like to note that the Complainant's motion and the submissions of both counsel have had very beneficial results. The Respondent has repeatedly claimed, and with justification, that it has no clear appreciation of the case that it has to meet.\n[12] In the materials submitted by the Complainant in support of her motion and in her Amended Statement of Particulars, the Complainant has now clearly defined the facts upon which she is relying; the issues that arise out of her complaint; and the remedies she seeks. This is all to the good and should allay the Respondent's concerns.\n[13] There were also some collateral matters raised at the hearing. The Complainant has asked the Respondent to provide further production, specifically as set out in paragraphs 51-56 of the Complainant's Amended Statement of Particulars. The Respondent will review these requests and advise the Complainant of its position by October 6, 2006.\n[14] Finally, the Tribunal has tentatively re-scheduled the hearing of the complaint to commence in Thunder Bay, in the week of April 2-5, 2007, continue in the week of April 10-13, and, if necessary, to resume on April 23, 2007.\nSigned by J.

FACTS A. Mr. Buffett's complaint [1] The Complainant, Terry Buffett, is a member of the Canadian Forces (CF). He holds the rank of Warrant Officer. He alleges that the CF denied him an employment benefit by refusing to grant him funding for a reproductive medical procedure (in vitro fertilization). He claims that this refusal constituted adverse differential treatment based on his disability (male factor infertility), his sex, and his family status, in breach of s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. He also alleges that the CF's refusal was made in furtherance of a discriminatory policy, contrary to s. 10 of the Act.\n[2] The CF, for its part, contends that discrimination was not a factor in its decision to refuse funding. The CF provides publicly funded health care coverage to its members only. The medical procedure in question would have to be performed on Mr. Buffett's wife, who is not a member of the CF. He is therefore not entitled to receive funding for this procedure under the CF's health plan.\n[3] For the reasons set out below, I find that Mr. Buffett's complaint is substantiated.\nB. Why did Mr. Buffett require funding for the reproductive procedure? [4] Mr. Buffett is 44 years of age. He enrolled in the CF in 1979. He has been married to his wife, Rhonda Buffett, since 1985. She is now 45 years old. The couple had problems conceiving, so they sought the assistance of professionals in the field of fertility. In 1995, Mr. Buffett was diagnosed with male factor infertility. He was found to have a low sperm count with below normal motility in the sperm. The morphology (i.e. the form and structure) of the sperm was also determined to be well below normal.\n[5] Mr. Buffett underwent a medical procedure known as varicocele embolization in July 1995 in an effort to improve the sperm quality. The procedure is intended to treat a dilated vein around the testicle, the presence of which may affect sperm parameters. Follow-up semen analyses of Mr. Buffett, however, showed only mild improvement in sperm motility, morphology and count. In February 1996, Dr. Mark Nigro, who is Mr. Buffett's urologist and an expert in male factor infertility, recommended the use of advanced reproductive technologies, namely in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), as the next logical step in the couple's efforts at conceiving a child.\nC. What are IVF and ICSI? [6] IVF is the process by which a woman's eggs are fertilized in a dish and then placed in her uterus. The first stage of the process (or cycle) involves the woman giving herself injections of a medication, over a period of 10 days, to stimulate her ovaries and mature several of her eggs and egg sacs (follicles). An ultrasound is conducted every 2 to 3 days to monitor the growth of the eggs in her ovaries. When at least three follicles of a certain size develop, the woman self-injects a drug that causes the eggs to advance to a final stage of maturation. Thirty-six hours later, the woman undergoes a procedure known as transvaginal egg recovery. The woman is sedated, and a needle is passed into the ovary. The eggs are removed from the follicles. The eggs are then combined with the sperm (comprised of about 6,500 individual sperm) in an incubated dish. They are allowed to join (fertilize) naturally. The eggs are checked daily and if fertilization occurs, a catheter is used to place the resulting embryos into the woman's uterus three to five days after the fertilization. If menstruation does not occur within 17 days thereafter, a pregnancy test is conducted.\n[7] When the sperm used contains too few normal, motile sperm, IVF has proven to have very little success, ranging from 4 to 6 percent. Dr. Nigro testified that reproductive endocrinologists do not recommend IVF alone where there are abnormalities in the sperm. In these cases, a combination of IVF and ICSI is the preferred course. In this procedure, normal-looking, active sperm are isolated from the sample provided by the man. Using a microscope and a delicate micromanipulation needle, one of these isolated sperm is injected directly into the egg. Thereafter, the same IVF process of incubation and transfer of embryos to the woman's body is employed.\n[8] Dr. Arthur Leader, a professor of obstetrics, gynaecology and medicine (endocrinology) at the University of Ottawa, testified as an expert in reproductive endocrinology and infertility. He explained that it takes a team of up to 30 people to conduct one cycle of IVF treatment. The cost is therefore not insignificant. Dr. Leader estimates the current cost for IVF at about $5,500-$6,000 per cycle, and an additional $1,100 to $1,300 per cycle if ICSI is also used. He noted that the cost in 1997, shortly after the procedure was first recommended to the Buffets, was about $3,000 per cycle of IVF and an additional $1,500 per cycle of IVF with ICSI. Dr. Nigro's estimates of current costs for the procedures were similar to Dr. Leader's ($6,000 per cycle of IVF and an additional $1,500 per cycle of IVF with ICSI).\n[9] Dr. Leader does not generally recommend more than three cycles of IVF or IVF with ICSI treatment for his female patients, who are on average 35 years of age. With women who are well into their 30's or older, research has shown that unless pregnancy is achieved within three attempts, it is unlikely the procedure will ever be successful.\n[10] According to Dr. Leader, with the introduction of ICSI, the pregnancy rate when using poor quality sperm has now reached the same level as that for standard IVF performed with normal quality sperm, about 30% per cycle.\n[11] A child is born in about 30% of cases where an embryo is implanted in the woman. This rate drops as the age of the woman, or the man who provides the sperm, increases, due to an increased risk of miscarriage, particularly after age 40. Dr. Leader indicated that IVF and IVF with ICSI are not recommended for women over 42. He testified that there are no recorded instances of women over age 43 undergoing a successful treatment.\nD. Do provincial health care plans fund IVF and IVF with ICSI treatments? [12] When Dr. Nigro made his recommendation for the IVF with ICSI treatment, Mr. Buffett was stationed at Canadian Forces Station Aldergrove in British Columbia. The Buffetts were therefore residing in that province at the time. In 1996, Mr. Buffett was transferred to the CF base in Gagetown, New Brunswick, where the couple took up new residence. The government-run health care plans of both British Columbia and New Brunswick did not pay for the cost of IVF treatments. In fact, none of Canada's provincial health plans have ever funded IVF treatments, with the sole exception of Ontario.\n[13] Until 1993, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) paid for the cost of IVF treatment for women, irrespective of the cause of the infertility necessitating its use. In 1993, Ontario de-listed IVF as an insured service except in situations where both of the woman's fallopian tubes were obstructed, known as bilateral fallopian tube obstruction.\n[14] No provincial plan has ever paid for the cost of IVF with ICSI. However, all provinces cover the cost of testing in relation to fertility issues.\n[15] Thus, any persons seeking IVF and IVF with ICSI treatments who reside outside Ontario, and any Ontarians seeking these treatments other than persons with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction, will be required to pay for these fertility procedures. Dr. Leader testified that the procedures are usually conducted in private clinics, of which there are 24 across the country.\nE. The CF's health care plan [16] Canada's system of publicly funded health insurance is, by virtue of the Constitution Act, 1867, a matter of provincial jurisdiction. The Government of Canada contributes, however, to the cost of providing health services in every province, subject to certain criteria and conditions, as set out in the Canada Health Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-6. One of these conditions is that any resident of a province shall be considered an insured person under that province's health plan, with the exception of certain designated classes of persons. Members of the Canadian Forces form one of these exempt classes of persons (s. 2). Accordingly, they do not receive health care coverage under any of Canada's provincial health care plans.\n[17] To ensure that its members are not deprived of publicly funded health care coverage, the CF has assumed the responsibility of providing health care to its members. According to Chapter 34 of the Queen's Regulations and Orders (QR&O), issued pursuant to s. 12(2) of the National Defence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. N-5, the CF must provide medical care, at public expense, to its members. The medical care provided encompasses medical and surgical treatment, diagnostic and investigative procedures, hospitalization, preventive medicine procedures, patient transportation, and the supply and maintenance of prosthetic appliances (art. 34.01 of the QR&O). In effect, the CF provides health care to its members on a scale similar to provincial health care plans. The scope of coverage under the CF's plan could be viewed as being even broader than that typically found under provincial plans. For instance, the CF provides full pharmaceutical coverage, as well as coverage for physiotherapy, social work and dental care. The plan is so comprehensive that some have described it as the 14th health services plan of Canada, after those of the ten provinces and three territories.\n[18] The Canadian Forces Health Services (CFHS) is a group operating within the CF as the designated provider of medical services to CF members. The CFHS has developed a large infrastructure for the delivery of services inside and outside Canada. The CFHS contains a core of uniformed medical professionals, including general physicians, specialists, nurses, pharmacists, administrators, social workers, medical assistants, and medical technicians. In addition, the CF employs a number of civilian medical experts on a contractual basis to provide care for its members.\n[19] Where it is necessary for a CF member to utilize the services of a civilian medical professional, the civilian health care provider submits an invoice to the CF for payment of the services provided. Thus, for instance, in Mr. Buffett's case, a CF physician employed at the Base Hospital located at Canadian Forces Base Chilliwack referred him to Dr. Nigro, who is a Vancouver-based specialist. Dr. Nigro is not employed by the CF. He billed the CF for his professional services, including the costs relating to Mr. Buffett's treatment and testing.\n[20] Brigadier-General Hillary Frances Jaeger testified at the hearing with respect to the CF's health care plan. She is the CF's Surgeon-General, with responsibilities that include looking after professional standards and ethics, assigning duties amongst medical staff, and developing clinical policy. She described her role as being analogous to that of a Chief of Medical Staff of a typical civilian hospital. She explained in her testimony that the CF's health plan has two principal goals. The first is to provide a degree of health care to CF members that is roughly comparable to that to which they would have been entitled were they not CF members. The second goal is to ensure that members are as operationally fit as they can be, in order to perform their duties at the level expected of them by the CF.\nF. Does the CF provide any health services to persons like Rhonda Buffett, who are family members of CF members? [21] The CF does not generally provide publicly funded health care to families of CF members. Pursuant to art. 34.23 of the QR&O, medical services may be provided to dependents of CF members (i.e. their spouses or children) in certain exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of an emergency, or where the dependents accompany the CF member to locations where adequate civilian medical facilities are unavailable, like Goose Bay, in Newfoundland and Labrador, for example. Given the relatively small size of that community and its geographic isolation, the dependents of CF members stationed there routinely receive health care from the CFHS. These family members are residents of Newfoundland and Labrador while living at the base, so the CF bills the cost of the health services provided to them directly to the province's health care plan.\n[22] Aside from these exceptional circumstances, dependents of CF members must access insured health services through the provincial government of the province in which they reside. Family members of CF members are, however, eligible for supplemental third party insurance coverage through the Public Service Health Care Plan (PSCHP). The PSHCP is an employer sponsored medical insurance plan that all CF members are eligible to join, and which offers additional coverage of medical services for their family members. The plan is funded through contributions from the employer and the CF Members. The plan provides additional partial insured coverage for services not covered under provincial health care plans, such as prescription drugs, dental work and eyeglasses. Mr. Buffett has purchased this coverage for Ms. Buffett.\nG. Does the CF's health care plan fund IVF or IVF with ICSI treatments for CF members? [23] Until 1997, the CF's health care plan did not fund IVF and IVF with ICSI treatments. This policy changed in September 1997. A female CF member stationed in Ontario had requested reimbursement for the cost of her IVF treatment, claiming that as a civilian residing in Ontario, she would have been entitled to have the procedure paid for at public expense. She argued that it was unfair for the CF's health care plan to have a policy that was more restrictive than that applied by the corresponding provincial health care plan, namely OHIP.\n[24] The CF member's funding request was initially turned down, so she filed a grievance, which was ultimately successful. The funding was awarded to her. Thereafter, the CF expanded its list of insured procedures to include IVF treatments. The CF takes several factors into account before expanding its list of insured services to add a particular health service. One of these factors consists of the availability of funding under provincial health plans for the service in question. As BGen. Jaeger explained, this is to ensure that members of the CF do not become disentitled to health services that would otherwise be available to them, merely because they happened to join the CF.\n[25] According to BGen. Jaeger, this factor was a principal reason for the CF's decision to add IVF treatment to its list of insured services. The grievance brought to the fore the fact that OHIP was already funding this treatment in certain specific circumstances (bilateral fallopian tube obstruction). The CF amended its policy to provide equal coverage to its members.\n[26] Details about this change in the CF's policy were made known to health care providers in the CF, by way of a message in writing that was circulated by the Chief of Health Services at National Defence Headquarters, on September 15, 1997. The message stated that IVF procedures were now authorized and could be approved at unit level if IVF had been recommended by a reproductive technology specialist. A maximum of three sessions would be funded, which accords with OHIP's policy as well. Interestingly, the message did not specify whether funding of the treatments would be restricted to patients with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction, as was the case under OHIP's post-1993 policy.\nH. What steps did Mr. Buffett take when he learned of the change in CF's policy? [27] Shortly after Dr. Nigro suggested, in February 1996, that the option of IVF treatment with ICSI be explored, Mr. Buffett met with a CF physician to discuss the matter. The CF physician informed Mr. Buffett that the CF's health plan did not provide any funding for this procedure. At the time, the Buffets were residing in British Columbia. Later that year, they moved to New Brunswick. Since the provincial health plans of both provinces did not fund the procedure, the couple could only have obtained it by paying for it themselves. They decided that they just could not afford the expense and resigned themselves to the likelihood that they would never have any biologically related children.\n[28] Their expectations changed dramatically, however, when one of Mr. Buffett's acquaintances, who was a CF medic serving at CFB Gagetown, forwarded to Mr. Buffett a copy of the message that National Defence Headquarters had circulated in September 1997, announcing the change in policy regarding funding for IVF treatments. With this news in hand, Mr. Buffett contacted a CF physician on the base and made a formal request for funding. The request was forwarded to the base surgeon, who refused to grant it. The grounds given for the refusal were that IVF is only provided in one province (i.e. Ontario), and that the funding was available only with respect to bilateral tubal obstruction.\n[29] On November 10, 1998, Mr. Buffett filed a grievance contesting this decision. He noted that the original message from National Defence Headquarters announcing the change in policy did not mention that coverage was restricted to patients with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction. He argued that this restriction was discriminatory, based on gender. Male CF members were being effectively denied benefits that female members were receiving, since men could not physiologically have tubal diseases.\n[30] In accordance with CF procedure, Mr. Buffett's grievance was reviewed and commented upon by his superior officers at various levels. The authority to grant the redress being sought, however, ultimately rested with the Chief of Defence Staff. Some of Mr. Buffett's superior officers who reviewed his grievance endorsed his claim. His commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel J.M. Duhamel wrote, on November 30, 1998, that Mr. Buffett's argument had merit, adding that basing eligibility for publicly funded IVF on a condition applicable solely to female soldiers amounts to excluding male soldiers on the basis of gender.\n[31] A similar position was adopted by BGen. D.W. Foster, Commander of Land Force Atlantic Area, in his subsequent review of the grievance. He found that Mr. Buffett's point of dual standards is well-taken, adding that he believed in all fairness that IVF should be offered to Mr. Buffett as it would to a female member's family.\n[32] Others disagreed. Lieutenant-General W.C. Leach, Chief of Land Staff, for instance, did not view the issue as being a matter of gender equality, but rather simply a medical reality that only women can have fallopian tube obstruction. In his opinion, the purpose of the CF policy of funding IVF for servicewomen was to address that condition and nothing else.\n[33] While the review of Mr. Buffett's grievance was progressing up through each of the various levels, a noteworthy development took place regarding the CF's health care policy. Until December of 1998, the only way to determine if a given medical procedure was covered by the CF's health plan was to consult the numerous messages that were sent from National Defence Headquarters, like the one circulated in September 1997 regarding IVF treatments. Some medical officers had taken to organizing the messages in binders, in order to assist them in making such determinations. To better enable CF members to understand the scope of the coverage to which they were entitled, the CF released its Spectrum of Care policy on December 21, 1998. The Spectrum of Care was essentially a compilation, in a single document, of the various health services decisions and messages issued over the years.\n[34] In the process of putting together the Spectrum of Care, the CF took the opportunity to clarify certain ambiguities regarding the services covered. BGen. Jaegar acknowledged in her evidence that there may have existed some ambiguity in the message that National Defence Headquarters had circulated in September 1997 setting out the restrictions associated with the funding of IVF treatments. Therefore, the Spectrum of Care now explicitly stated that funding for IVF treatments would only be provided,\nif the infertility was the result of fallopian tube obstruction, for a maximum of three cycles, and to serving members of the CF, not to their civilian dependents, spouses or partners.\nThese requirements had not been mentioned in the September 1997 message. BGen. Jaegar hastened to add in her evidence, however, that while the original message that was circulated may have lacked these details, one aspect of the policy was always clear: Pursuant to Chapter 34 of the QR&O, only serving CF members are entitled to CF's health care benefits. She pointed out that this is an order set down from the highest level (i.e. the QR&Os), which trumps all others.\n[35] In June 2000, Mr. Buffett's grievance was referred to the Canadian Forces Grievance Board (CFGB) to review and provide findings and recommendations to the Chief of Defence Staff, in accordance with art. 7.12 of the QR&O. The CFGB released its findings and recommendations on April 4, 2001. It recommended that the grievance be denied, noting that dependents of CF Members are not generally covered under the CF's health policy and that the refusal of Mr. Buffett's IVF funding request was in accordance with the policy. The CFGB found that the lack of access to IVF coverage for most members of groups other than those specified [in the policy] may be discriminatory under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. But the CFGB went on to find that the restricted access to funding in this area was justified as a reasonable limit, under s. 1 of the Charter.\n[36] On January 30, 2002, the Chief of Defence Staff, General R.R. Henault, issued his findings regarding Mr. Buffett's grievance. Gen. Henault stated that he concurred with the essence of the CFGB's findings and that therefore, he did not support Mr. Buffett's application for redress.\n[37] On May 23, 2002, Mr. Buffett filed his human rights complaint in which he alleged that he had been discriminated against, under s. 7 of the Act. He amended his complaint on February 3, 2004, to add the allegation that the CF had applied a discriminatory policy, within the meaning of s. 10 of the Act.\nII. ANALYSIS A. What must Mr. Buffett demonstrate to establish discrimination in this case? [38] Complainants in human rights cases must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28 (O'Malley)). In the present case, the Commission and the Complainant must establish that:\nin denying him funding for the IVF treatment, the CF differentiated adversely in relation to Mr. Buffett on a prohibited ground, in the course of his employment (s. 7), or in deciding not to fund this treatment, the CF established or pursued a policy or practice that deprived or tended to deprive Mr. Buffett or a class of individuals, of an employment opportunity on a prohibited ground (s. 10).\nFor the purposes of the Act, members of the CF are deemed to be employed by the Crown (s. 64).\n[39] Once the prima facie case is established, it is incumbent upon the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for the otherwise discriminatory practice (Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204 at para. 18). An employer's conduct will not be considered discriminatory if it can establish that its refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) (s. 15(1)(a) of the Act). For any practice to be considered a BFOR, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of the individual or class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost (s. 15(2) of the Act).\nB. Has a prima facie case of discrimination based on sex pursuant to s. 7 of the Act been established?\n(i) Mr. Buffett's and the Commission's position [40] According to Mr. Buffett and the Commission, it is clear that the CF's health care plan adversely differentiates against him and other men with male factor infertility who are members of the CF, on the basis of sex. The plan provides coverage for IVF treatments to its female members with bilateral obstruction of their fallopian tubes, a uniquely female form of infertility. At the same time, the plan denies coverage to Mr. Buffett, a male CF member with male factor infertility.\n[41] The Commission and Mr. Buffett submit that the medical services provided under the CF's health care plan constitute an employment benefit for CF members, which must be offered to all members in a substantively equal and non-discriminatory manner. As was stated by the Supreme Court in Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219 at para. 34, once an employer decides to provide an employee benefit package, it cannot make exclusions from such schemes in a discriminatory fashion.\n(ii) The CF's position [42] The CF contends that the benefit in question is, in fact, provided in a non-discriminatory fashion to its members. Since CF members are excluded from coverage under provincial and territorial health care plans, the CF has established its own program to provide publicly funded health care to its members only, not to their families. The CF does not have a legislative mandate to provide medical coverage for non-members and, pursuant to art. 34.23 of the QR&O, medical services may be provided to dependents (spouses and children) but only under certain exceptional circumstances, such as in emergencies or at remote locations. These services are eventually billed back to the non-members' provincial or territorial health care plans. Thus, they are not truly funded by the CF.\n[43] The CF points out that IVF and IVF with ICSI are medical procedures that enable a woman to become pregnant. Aside from the sperm that is provided by the male partner, the procedure solely involves the woman. OHIP (the only provincial health care plan that funds the procedure) bills the treatment against the woman's health insurance number, not the male partner's. In Mr. Buffett's case, when it became evident that IVF treatment with ICSI was the next available option for the couple, Mr. Buffett's urologist, Dr. Nigro, ceased dealing with the matter. Instead, Dr. Nigro advised the couple to consult with Ms. Buffett's reproductive endocrinologist about the possibility of obtaining IVF treatment with ICSI. Mr. Buffett acknowledged in his testimony that although he accompanied his wife on her visits to her endocrinologist, he was never that physician's patient.\n[44] Dr. Leader testified that before commencing treatments, he usually meets with both partners. He needs to be familiar with any allergies that the male partner may have. He must also test the man's semen. It could be infected, in which case he would have to prescribe treatment before proceeding any further. Dr. Leader referred to infertility as a couple problem. He noted, however, that despite the male partner's participation, it is ultimately only the woman's consent that is required before initiating the treatments.\n[45] The CF therefore argues that the evidence is clear: IVF treatment, with or without ICSI, is a medical service that is received exclusively by a woman. In the present case, the woman who would be receiving the medical service being sought by Mr. Buffett is his wife, who is not a member of the CF. As a non-member, she is not eligible under the CF's health care program for coverage of her treatment. The distinction being made in the provision of the medical service is based on whether or not the recipient is a member of the CF, not on the basis of his or her sex.\n(iii) A comparative analysis [46] The CF submits that in assessing whether a discriminatory practice has taken place, within the meaning of s. 7, a comparative analysis should be conducted, the outcome of which must demonstrate differential treatment compared to another relevant group.\n[47] I am prepared to accept that in the context of this complaint and the manner in which the allegations have been framed, conducting a comparison between relevant individuals or groups is helpful in determining whether a prima facie case of adverse differential treatment has been established. As the Federal Court of Appeal noted in Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), 2005 FCA 154 at paras. 23 et ss., the legal test for establishing a prima facie case of discrimination is flexible and will vary depending on the fact patterns of each case. In the present case, Mr. Buffett has alleged that the CF treated him differently than female CF members who have a form of female-factor infertility. Accordingly, a comparison between him and his female colleagues would be appropriate and instructive.\n[48] It is necessary to identify the appropriate comparator in order to be able to determine the existence of any differential treatment, as well as the grounds for the distinction (McAllister-Windsor v. Canada (Human Resources Development) (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. 48 at para. 40 (C.H.R.T.)). In defining the comparator group, one must take into account the purpose of the scheme that confers the benefit in issue (Battlefords and District Co-operative Ltd. v. Gibbs, 1996 S.C.R. 566 at para. 33).\n[49] According to the CF, the purpose of its health care plan is to provide medical care to CF members. The CF suggests that Mr. Buffett should be compared to female members who would be seeking fertility treatments for their non-member spouses or, in the alternative, to male and female members seeking treatment for their spouses with respect to non-fertility related conditions. In either case, the outcome of the comparison would be the same; the non-member spouses would not be entitled, under any circumstances, to receive publicly funded medical services from the CF. Regardless of the gender of the spouse, the nature of the condition, or the type of treatment sought, coverage for medical treatment of spouses is not permitted. Mr. Buffett was therefore not treated any differently under the health plan than any other CF members, male or female. The distinction in coverage is made on the basis of membership in the CF, which is not a prohibited ground under the Act.\n[50] The CF contends, in addition, that if any distinction is being made between men and women under its health care plan, it is a distinction based solely on biological differences between the two sexes. It is only a woman who is physically able to become pregnant. Therefore, providing funding to women only, for a treatment that causes pregnancy, cannot be discriminatory. Conversely, the CF health plan funds comparable fertility treatments for men in accordance with their physiological realities. An example from the present case would be the CF's funding of Mr. Buffett's varicocele embolization, which would have reversed his male factor infertility, had it been successful. The CF submits, therefore, that the limitation it has set on funding for IVF recognizes the biological reality that only women can receive the treatment and become pregnant. The policy is not, as a result, discriminatory.\n[51] I disagree. In my view, a distinction can be drawn between procedures that reverse infertility and procedures that induce or assist conception. Procedures that are intended to reverse a person's infertility are clearly medical procedures that are performed exclusively on that person. This would include, for instance, surgery to reconstruct a woman's obstructed fallopian tubes. According to Dr. Leader, this was a procedure that was opted for quite readily in the past, prior to the development of advanced reproductive technologies. The varicocele embolization procedure that Mr. Buffett underwent would constitute another example of these types of medical procedures.\n[52] IVF and ICSI, on the other hand, are entirely different in nature. These treatments do not reverse the patient's male or female factor infertility. Instead, the treatments offer the couple the opportunity to conceive and have a child that is biologically theirs, irrespective of who has the infertility problem. As Dr. Nigro stated in his evidence, you don't use IVF unless you want a baby. In my view, the CF has construed the facts of this case too narrowly. The CF takes the position that since nearly all aspects of the IVF and IVF with ICSI treatments involve the woman, they are medical procedures that only relate to her. But this fails to take into account the fact that assisted conception procedures are different from all other medical procedures, including procedures to reverse infertility, in that by biological necessity, two individuals must be involved.\n[53] The CF's health care policy is structured in such a way as to provide the female member who has a form of female factor infertility with a publicly funded service that will afford her the opportunity to have a child. Physiologically, this procedure can only be completed with the contribution of a person of the opposite gender. The CF funds the service for the female member, even if the opposite-gender contribution comes from a non-member of the CF. On the other hand, the CF does not provide the equal benefit to a male member with male factor infertility, merely because the contribution from the opposite-gender non-member is much more medically complex. And yet, the same physiological reality exists that conception can only occur with the participation of both partners.\n[54] This reality is a key factor in making an appropriate comparison in this case. The fact is that IVF is not merely a medical procedure that is being offered to female CF members. These women are being given a real opportunity to have a child. That is the essential purpose of this treatment. In my view, given this context, the proper comparative question to pose is, does the CF offer the same benefit to its male members with infertility problems that it is offering to its female members with infertility problems?\n[55] The answer is clearly no. It does not matter that the CF's original motivation for adding IVF treatment to its list of medical services for its female members who have a certain medical condition, was so as to ensure that the coverage provided under its health care plan was equal to that of a provincial scheme (in this case, OHIP). Considering the policy's true purpose and its effect, the result is that Mr. Buffett is denied a benefit that is at the same time being provided to female CF members, i.e. access to assisted conception by IVF. As such, the treatment is unequal.\n[56] The CF points out that since Mr. Buffett cannot benefit from the standard IVF procedure, he cannot claim to have received unequal treatment from the CF. While standard IVF will assist women with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction to become pregnant and have children, IVF alone would be of virtually no assistance to men like Mr. Buffett who have severe male factor infertility. The pregnancy rate in these instances is no higher than 6%. Dr. Nigro and Dr. Leader both testified that standard IVF is not recommended in such cases. Consequently, the CF contends that its female members with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction are not receiving a benefit that is being unfairly denied to male members. These men would not stand to gain any benefit from standard IVF treatment, so they are not being denied anything in effect.\n[57] Mr. Buffett indicated to the Tribunal at the hearing that he was willing to accept funding for standard IVF treatment for himself and his wife, even if it afforded them only a minimal possibility of achieving a pregnancy. In my view, however, this assertion does not help to advance the analysis of this case. While Mr. Buffett may be willing to accept any attempt made in the hope of having a child, the medical evidence before me is clear; IVF alone is medically impractical at achieving this result for a person with his condition. Both experts said that they would not recommend the treatment in Mr. Buffett's case. It would be a futile effort.\n[58] Mr. Buffett could only achieve the result he seeks through treatments of IVF with ICSI. According to the CF, if these treatments are to be funded, Mr. Buffett would in effect receive an additional benefit that is not available to any other CF members, whether male or female. Indeed, not a single publicly funded health plan in the country offers coverage for IVF with ICSI. If Mr. Buffett was successful in his claim, therefore, he would be obtaining coverage that is more than equal to that which is available to women CF members.\n[59] However, equal treatment does not always mean identical treatment (see Weatherall v. Canada (Attorney General), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 872). Occasionally, a different treatment may be called for in order to achieve substantive equality between the comparator groups. Dr. Leader's testimony is very instructive in this respect. He noted that until the ICSI technique was developed, there existed a wide gap in the effectiveness of IVF between cases of female factor and male factor infertility. With the introduction of ICSI, the pregnancy rates with respect to both forms of infertility were normalized to a level of about 30% per cycle.\n[60] Thus, in order for male CF members to receive a benefit that is equal to the benefit being offered to female members with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction, IVF treatments with ICSI would need to be made available to them. Of course, I am mindful of the increased costs associated with ICSI (ranging from $1,100 to $1,500, according to the expert witnesses). In my view, however, it is more appropriate to take these additional costs into account at a later stage, during the undue hardship analysis that is conducted in assessing CF's justification for its policy.\n[61] Counsel for the CF suggested in her final submissions that the inequality created by offering publicly funded IVF with ICSI treatments to male members is akin to providing them gold standard service that would be unavailable to female members. Women would also benefit from the addition of ICSI to their IVF treatments as the additional procedure would assure them of a pregnancy. With respect, I did not find any evidence to this effect anywhere on the record in this case. On the contrary, the only discussion regarding this matter came up in Dr. Leader's testimony, in which he indicated that ICSI levels the playing field, so to speak, between male and female factor infertility. He did not indicate that women would gain any benefit from having ICSI added to their standard IVF treatments, where the sperm used is normal.\n[62] To sum up, in my opinion, the Commission and Mr. Buffet have adduced evidence demonstrating that an adverse differentiation was made between Mr. Buffett and his female colleagues, on the basis of his sex. A prima facie case of discrimination has therefore been established.\nC. Does the CF have a reasonable explanation for its otherwise discriminatory practice? [63] As I mentioned earlier, once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation. In this particular case, the CF must demonstrate that its refusal to provide Mr. Buffett with the employment benefit at issue (funding for the IVF treatment with ICSI) was based on a BFOR (s. 15(1)(a) of the Act). To do so, the CF must establish that accommodating his needs or the needs of the class of individuals like him would impose undue hardship on the CF, considering health, safety and cost (s. 15(2) of the Act).\n[64] The Supreme Court has articulated a three-step approach to be followed in determining whether a BFOR has been established (see British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin); and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 (Grismer)). A respondent may justify the impugned standard by proving, on the balance of probabilities, that:\nThe respondent adopted the standard for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the job or function being performed;\nThe respondent adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate purpose or goal; The standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that purpose or goal. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, the respondent must demonstrate that it is impossible to accommodate the complainant or persons with the complainant's characteristics without incurring undue hardship. It is incumbent on the respondent to show that it considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation.\n(i) Did the CF adopt its policy for a purpose or goal rationally connected to the job or function being performed? [65] The CF submits that the standard or policy at issue in the present case is rationally connected to the goals and purposes of the CF's medical coverage under its health care plan. Its policy on fertility treatment was changed to include IVF coverage for female CF members with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction for the purpose of ensuring that members within the CF received the same level of care as non-members covered by provincial plans, namely OHIP.\n[66] I accept that the CF's policy was rationally connected to its goal of satisfying its obligations to provide publicly funded health care to its members that is equal to the level of health care available under Canada's provincial health care plans. The first step of the defence has been established.\n(ii) Did the CF adopt its standard in good faith? [67] I am satisfied that the CF adopted its policy in good faith. Its intention was to match the level of health services available under the provincial health plan in Ontario. The decision was taken following a successful grievance filed by a female CF member residing in Ontario. Rather than treat the grievance as specific only to that member's case, the CF opted to modify its policy and effectively extend the redress of that grievance to other members as well. In my opinion, these actions were clearly taken in good faith. The second step of the defence has been established.\n(iii) Is the standard reasonably necessary to accomplish its goal such that the CF cannot accommodate Mr. Buffett and other CF members with male factor infertility without incurring undue hardship? [68] The CF contends that the financial impact of changing the level of health coverage would be significant and would affect its ability to offer medical services to its members. Considering the cost involved, the CF submits that funding IVF treatments with ICSI would impose undue hardship on the CF.\n[69] Commodore Margaret Kavanagh is the Commander of the CFHS and Director General of Health Services. She testified that the CFHS receives its funding from the Department of National Defence. The sum provided in 2004-05 was $270 million of which approximately $193 million was spent on direct patient care or service delivery, which would include performing operations, buying health services from the civilian sector, and purchasing drugs. The remainder went to operational costs such as the training of staff, technology support, comptrollership, and other matters relating to overhead. The $270 million budget, however, excludes the cost of salaries for the CFHS's full-time health professionals and other staff. These costs are subsumed in other CF budgets. When all of the costs are put together, the CF's total budget for the delivery of medical care totals over $700 million.\n[70] Cmdre. Kavanagh testified that if the CFHS was required to fund IVF treatments or other procedures that cost a significant amount of money, the level of services available would be affected. She pointed out that the CFHS's funding is not a bottomless pit and consequently, some choices would have to be made on what could be funded. Medical treatments would not likely be removed from the list of available services for members, but training for health care professionals might have to be reduced. She added that even if the Department of National Defence increased the CFHS funding to cover the additional costs for IVF treatments, it would result in fewer funds being made available for the operational budgets of the CF.\n[71] In the CF's submission, the evidence before the Tribunal demonstrates that the change in policy being sought by the Commission and Mr. Buffett would impose a significant additional cost on the CF, which in turn would have a direct and detrimental impact on the services that the CF is able to provide. Tough decisions based on the resulting financial restraint would have to be made and would diminish other current areas of funding. According to the CF, this impact would cause it undue hardship.\na) The evidence of Major Weisgerber [72] But what evidence did the CF lead regarding the actual impact of such funding? Major Chris Weisgerber was called as a witness by the CF. Until recently, he was serving within the Health Services Delivery Directorate of CFHS, Primary Care Services Section. He prepared a report documenting the financial impact of policy changes that would extend coverage for IVF treatments to all CF members and their partners in all cases. He concluded that the initial cost to the CF of such a change would be as high as $180 million.\n[73] Before making his calculations, Maj. Weisgerber consulted an Internet website known as myfertility.ca, which stated that the cost for IVF in 2003 was between $6,000 and $8,000 per cycle including medications. The website apparently also indicated that infertility rates are estimated to be up to 15% for couples overall.\n[74] Based on these figures, Maj. Weisgerber proceeded with his calculation. He estimated the number of persons eligible to receive CF health care benefits at 50,000. This number is intended to encompass the substantial Reservist population that is constantly rotating on and off contracts with the CF. He testified that to try to figure out how many uniformed CF members at one point in time would qualify for fertility services would be very difficult to do. In his opinion, however, this estimate is reasonable and conservative.\nMaj. Weisgerber then performed the following calculation:\n50,000 eligible personnel x 15% infertility rate x $24,000 (3 IVF cycles @ $8,000\/cycle) = $180,000,000.\n[75] In cross-examination, Maj. Weisgerber acknowledged that his estimate was based on a worst-case scenario. I find that there are several significant flaws in Maj. Weisgerber's analysis, which in my view render the report of little value in determining the potential impact on CF of a change in the policy.\n[76] First of all, it is assumed that each IVF treatment will require three cycles. The medical expert evidence before me is clear, however, that there is a good possibility of a woman's becoming pregnant from her very first cycle of IVF treatment. The average rate of pregnancy per cycle of IVF is about 30%, according to Dr. Leader. Thus the cost per couple will probably turn out to be significantly less than the $24,000 proposed by Maj. Weisgerber. There is, in fact, some indication to this effect in a table that he incorporated in his report, which documents the professional fertility fees paid by the CF to treat its female members who were already eligible for standard IVF treatments and had received funding under the existing policy, between 2001 and 2005. The average cost per year to treat each person appears to have varied between $3,375 and $5,738. These sums are significantly lower than those employed by Maj. Weisgerber in his report. These figures do not include the cost of medications, ancillary investigation costs, travel costs, or work productivity costs, but in the case of non-member spouses, many of these items would be covered by their provincial health plans or their third party insurer (e.g. the PSHCP). It is not evident that any portion of the cost for these items would be borne by the CF, and certainly no evidence was led by the CF detailing what these additional items would cost to the CF.\n[77] In addition, Maj. Weisgerber relied on data that is not contemporaneous with the date of the alleged discriminatory practice. He assumed that the cost of each cycle of IVF treatment in 2003 would be $8,000, a figure that he found on an Internet website. Yet, Mr. Buffett's complaint relates to the CF's denial of his funding request that occurred five years earlier, in 1998. Dr. Leader's evidence was to the effect that in 1997, the cost per cycle of IVF treatment was about $3,000.\n[78] Furthermore, Maj. Weisgerber has assumed in his calculations that every couple with an infertility problem will opt for IVF treatment. It is unrealistic, however, to take it for granted that all persons with this condition will want to have a child, or one that is biologically related to them. For instance, not all women may be willing to undergo the treatment, even if it was fully funded by the health care plan. The procedure involves the woman self-injecting herself for days with medications that Dr. Leader characterized as very potent. The eggs must be physically removed from her and the embryos must be subsequently placed into her uterus with a catheter. Dr. Leader described this procedure as an emotional roller-coaster for the woman. He explained that there are certain physical risks involved with the procedure (e.g., an over stimulation of the ovaries; haemorrhaging, bacterial infections). The likelihood of these physical risks is fairly low, but the emotional risk to the patient can be significant. If she does not become pregnant after having made such a physical and emotional investment, it can be quite devastating psychologically for her, according to Dr. Leader. Given these risks and other considerations, it is far from certain that every woman with access to full public funding for this procedure will opt for it nonetheless.\n[79] In addition, as the evidence of both Dr. Nigro and Dr. Leader indicated, there are several options available to achieve pregnancy other than advanced reproductive procedures. For instance, some men may manage to resolve their infertility problems with varicocele embolization, which is already funded under the CF's health plan and provincial health plans. In other cases, where the sperm has relatively few abnormalities, a couple may successfully conceive a child through the use of artificial insemination, the cost of which is also covered by the CF's health plan and provincial health plans. Dr. Leader testified that some fertility problems can be treated with hormone treatments, administered to both men and women, or even through lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, cessation of smoking, and the elimination of certain occupational hazards.\n[80] Thus, it has not been established that every couple who experiences infertility will inevitably seek IVF treatments.\n[81] Maj. Weisgerber's estimate seems to also presuppose that every couple will request IVF treatments at once, within the first year of the change in policy. This is highly improbable. As Cmdre. Kavanagh testified, whenever the CFHS changes a policy, not every possible beneficiary of the change immediately claims the service. She stated quite candidly that I am not going to have to suddenly spend $180 million if we change this policy tomorrow. Indeed, when the CF changed its policy to include coverage of IVF treatments for women with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction, every female CF member with this condition did not immediately request the treatment. The table from Maj. Weisgerber's report indicates that a fairly consistent number of female CF members sought this coverage from year to year. Seven women received funded treatment in the 2001-2002 fiscal year, six women in 2002- 2003, two women in 2003-2004, and seven women in 2004-2005.\n[82] In addition, Maj. Weisgerber has assumed, for the purposes of his calculations, that the policy would be expanded to allow all members, male and female, who are having difficulty conceiving a child with their partners, to receive funding for IVF treatments. This would include women with infertility problems that are not due to bilateral fallopian tube obstruction. In the human rights complaint, however, Mr. Buffett did not impugn the lack of access to IVF in these circumstances. Rather, he only alleged that the CF had discriminated against him and other men like him who are affected by male factor infertility. This is the only issue for which he seeks redress.\n[83] Finally, as Maj. Weisgerber acknowledged in his evidence, his calculations were basically guesstimates. He added that in his opinion, no one could really estimate the costs reliably, given the variables and unpredictability of the ultimate utilization of the service. He stated that therefore, the actual cost of changing the policy could be higher or lower.\n[84] He nuanced his comments by pointing out that he had not placed too much emphasis in his report on the costs arising from a change in the policy. He focussed more on some of the other issues associated with expanding the policy. Yet, in terms of content, most of the report is devoted to analyzing the direct financial costs to the CF. There is some slight mention made elsewhere in the report of the other issues, with respect to the indirect impact and costs. These costs would include the possibility of additional expenses relating to the supplementary maternal health and neonatal services, due to the increased complication rate associated with IVF. Maj. Weisgerber acknowledged, however, that since in cases like Mr. Buffett's, it would be a non-CF member who would be receiving these services, the provincial and territorial health plans would incur these costs, not the CF.\n[85] He also expressed some concern in the report about the precedent that a change in policy would set for those who might demand coverage for additional couple related services from the CF, such as family counselling. Maj. Weisgerber did not elaborate any further on the magnitude of these possible additional costs to the CF.\n[86] Based on all of the foregoing, I do not find that Maj. Weisgerber's report provides any reliable indication of the additional costs associated with the change in policy regarding the funding of IVF by the CF and the extent of their impact, in the circumstances impugned by Mr. Buffett.\nb) The evidence of BGen. Jaegar [87] BGen. Jaegar, in her testimony, recognized that Maj. Weisgerber's figures were demonstrative of a worst-case scenario, in which it was assumed that everyone who was potentially infertile would seek IVF treatment at once. She therefore undertook to come up with a figure that would be as realistic...as you are likely to get.\n[88] She began by taking the number of CF members who were under the age of 45. As the medical experts who testified had indicated, IVF is not recommended for persons beyond their mid-40's. Brig. Gen Jaegar then multiplied that figure by the percentage of CF members who were married, which she claims is about 67%. The product from this calculation was about 39,000 people. She then multiplied this number by the expected percentage of married persons who have fertility problems. She did not indicate in her testimony what percentage she used other than to say it was between 10 and 15 percent. She testified that the product of this calculation was 5,000 persons, which would suggest that she made this calculation using 13% as the percentage of persons with fertility problems.\n[89] For the next phase of her calculations, she needed an estimate of the likely uptake rate for the newly available IVF treatment. To determine this figure, she consulted the data regarding the number of women who had sought IVF under the existing policy. At the time she made her calculations, of the 9,600 female members of the CF, she estimated that 5,900 would have been under age 45, as well as married (assuming a marriage rate of 67%). Using an infertility rate at the low end of the range (10%), she concluded that there are about 600 infertile women in the CF. She asserted that in the case of 10% of those women, the infertility problem was attributable to bilateral fallopian tube obstruction, although it was not made clear where she drew this figure from. She mentioned having consulted websites on the Internet. The result therefore would be that 10% of the 600 infertile women (i.e. 60 persons) would have been entitled to receive IVF treatment under the CF's existing Spectrum of Care.\n[90] Maj. Weisgerber's actual figures show, however, that over the four years from mid-2001 to mid-2005, only 24 women sought IVF treatment, or an average of 6 per year, which means that only 10% of eligible women sought the treatment each year.\n[91] Brig. Gen Jaegar therefore applied this same 10% figure to the number of eligible members, male and female, who would be entitled to receive the IVF infertility treatment, for themselves or their partners, under an expanded policy (i.e. 5,000 eligible persons x 10% = 500 persons). She then multiplied this figure by $24,000 (i.e. three cycles of IVF treatment x $8,000). The resulting overall annual cost of expanding the CF's policy on IVF treatment would be $12 million, which BGen. Jaegar opted to pare down to $10 million to reflect the fact that her figures were so rough.\n[92] While this figure may be more realistic than that put forth by Maj. Weisgerber, some significant errors are repeated in BGen. Jaegar's calculations as well. She relied again upon the $8,000 estimate per cycle, which reflects the supposed cost in 2003, five years after Mr. Buffett's funding request. BGen. Jaegar also assumed, as did Maj. Weisgerber, that three treatments of IVF would be required in every case. As I discussed earlier, this is not necessarily the case, and the statistics from previous IVF treatments funded by the CF show that the average cost per member treated was about $4,800, which works out to 20% of the $24,000 figure utilized in BGen. Jaegar's calculations. If one were to discount BGen. Jaegar's estimation of the total cost by the same percentage, the annual cost arising from the change in policy regarding IVF treatments would be around $2 million.\n[93] Admittedly, BGen. Jaegar's calculations did not factor in the additional cost of ICSI, which on the evidence of Dr. Nigro and Dr. Leader, comes in at up to $1,500 per cycle. However, even if we were to take BGen. Jaegar's approach and assume that three cycles would be required by each of the estimated 500 persons seeking coverage annually, the impact of adding the cost of ICSI would be an additional $2.25 million to the IVF cost of $10 million. But I believe this figure to be exaggerated. At the risk of repeating myself, it is unlikely that three treatments would be required in every case. Furthermore, ICSI will not necessarily be employed in every case. BGen. Jaegar formulated her calculations based on the same assumption regarding an expanded health care policy as Maj. Weisgerber, to the effect that the policy would be expanded with regard to all CF members, male and female. Under such an expanded policy, there may be instances where female CF members with forms of female factor infertility that did not entitle them to funded IVF treatments under the existing policy, will now seek out such funded treatments. In these cases, ICSI will not be required. According to the medical expert evidence in this case, ICSI is only called upon to supplement standard IVF treatment when the male partner presents with severe male factor infertility.\n[94] In addition, just as in the case of Maj. Weisgerber, BGen. Jaegar appears to subsume all forms of infertility into a single group, for which IVF will be a choice that will always be opted for. Yet, as I have already explained, there may be instances where although a CF member may become eligible under an expanded policy to receive IVF treatment, other options will be pursued to help resolve the infertility issues. Thus, the annual uptake may, in fact, be less than the 500 individuals estimated.\n[95] In my view, therefore, CF's cost estimates, whether based on Maj. Weisgerber's figures or those of BGen. Jaeger, are unreliable.\nc) Will the additional cost impose undue hardship? [96] As I have just indicated, I find Maj. Weisgerber's and BGen. Jaegar's estimates of the additional costs associated with an expansion of the policy to cover IVF treatments for Mr. Buffett and others like him unreliable and exaggerated. However, even if BGen. Jaegar's more conservative figures were as realistic as she claims, what evidence is there that it would be impossible to make this accommodation for the complainant and others like him without imposing undue hardship on the CF?\n[97] The CFHS spent $193 million on direct patient care in 2004-05. Of this amount, $15 million was spent on all mental health services, $2 million on orthopaedic care, and $22 million on all medications. With these sums in mind, BGen. Jaeger's $10 million estimate for the cost of expanding the IVF coverage, with an additional $2.25 million for ICSI treatments, would appear to be quite significant. The CF argued that this additional expense would have a direct and detrimental impact on the services it would be able to provide.\n[98] But would it be impossible for the CF to absorb this additional cost without incurring undue hardship? Cmdre. Kavanagh testified that while financial considerations are a factor in decisions regarding which medical services to cover under the plan, they are not the prime reason for the decisions. The members' health care needs and well-being are the most important factors. She noted that her budget has increased at a significant but steady rate over the last few years, on average 5 to 6 percent per year, which is consistent with health care inflation. The CFHS has managed to receive the additional funding to cover its increased costs because, according to Cmdre. Kavanagh, we have proven to the organization that we need more money.\n[99] The effect of the increased costs associated with an expanded IVF policy on the CF's overall budget was not demonstrated in the evidence. There was no clear evidence adduced of the CF's previous or current total overall budget. Cmdre. Kavanagh testified that she did not know the exact number but that it was in the billions. She was able to confirm that the CFHS's $270 million funding represents less than 10 per cent of the CF's total budget. More importantly, the CF did not lead any evidence with respect to its funding or budgets at the time when Mr. Buffett was refused coverage for the treatment in 1998, and it is impossible to reliably assess the impact at the time of any additional costs arising from an expanded range of health coverage.\n[100] In my view, the evidence does not establish that it is impossible for the CF to accommodate Mr. Buffett and other male CF members with his characteristics, without incurring undue hardship. BGen. Jaegar described the $10 million estimate of additional annual costs, a sum that I have determined to be exaggerated, as being not insignificant, compared to the CFHS's spending on other forms of services. That might be the case, but it was incumbent upon the CF to prove that the additional cost would be so high as to impose undue hardship on the CF. It failed to do so.\n[101] For all of these reasons, I find that the CF's refusal to grant Mr. Buffett funding for in vitro fertilization constituted adverse differentiation on the basis of sex, in the course of his employment. Mr. Buffett's complaint in this respect has been substantiated.\nD. Has a discriminatory practice based on disability been established, pursuant to s. 7? [102] Mr. Buffett's claim that his male factor infertility constitutes a disability was not challenged by the CF.\n[103] The Supreme Court, in Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montr\u00e9al City and Boisbriand (City), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665 at para. 79, noted that a handicap or disability, within the meaning of human rights legislation, may be the result of a physical limitation, an ailment, a social construct, a perceived limitation, or a combination of all of these.\n[104] In the present case, Dr. Leader testified that most people are hard-wired to want to have children. Infertility denies them this need. In his view, treating people's infertility is a necessary component of health care, adding that there is also a significant psychological impact on both the male and the female partner when they are unable to achieve pregnancy. Indeed, Mr. Buffett spoke in his testimony of how his infertility problem has so troubled him and his spouse emotionally, that they avoid interacting with colleagues and friends who have children. In cross-examination, Dr. Leader agreed with the proposition that infertility is an illness and a disability, pointing out that it has been so defined by the World Health Organization.\n[105] In light of the foregoing, I am satisfied that Mr. Buffett's infertility constitutes a disability within the meaning of the Act.\n[106] The reasoning that gives rise to a finding of discrimination on the basis of sex in this case, can apply equally to the claim of discrimination based on disability. The CF's policy has the effect of providing a benefit in the course of employment (i.e. funding for IVF treatments) to CF members with a form of disability that prevents them from conceiving a child (bilateral fallopian tube obstruction). At the same time, the same benefit is denied to CF members with a different form of the disability (male factor infertility). The proper comparative question to pose in this context does not differ greatly from that used in conducting the analysis of discrimination based on sex: Does the CF offer the same benefit to its members with male factor infertility that it offers to its members whose infertility is caused by another disability (bilateral fallopian tube obstruction)?\n[107] The answer to this question is also no. A prima facie case of adverse differential treatment between persons with different forms of disability has been established. The CF's submissions in favour of a reasonable non-discriminatory explanation for such a finding do not differ from those made in regard to the claim of discrimination on the basis of sex. There is no distinction to be drawn between the two grounds of discrimination, with respect to the CF's assertion that it would suffer undue hardship if required to expand its IVF funding policy. In effect, the CF presented and relied upon the same evidence and arguments with respect to the disability complaint as it did with respect to the allegations of discrimination on the basis of sex.\n[108] The CF's defence can therefore be considered in the same manner in both instances and my findings are similar as well. The same flaws in the evidence regarding the estimates of the cost of expanding the policy emerge in both cases and my finding is likewise the same: any additional expenses associated with an expanded IVF funding policy would not be excessive to the point of imposing undue hardship on the CF.\n[109] I therefore find that CF's refusal to provide funding to Mr. Buffett for IVF differentiated adversely against him on the basis of his disability. His complaint in this respect has been substantiated as well.\nE. Allegation of discrimination on the basis of family status [110] Neither the Commission nor Mr. Buffett made any significant submissions regarding this alleged ground of discrimination at the hearing, other than a general statement made by Commission counsel in closing arguments that the IVF funding policy was discriminatory on the basis of family status to a certain extent. I was not directed to any evidence that would support or relate to this allegation, and it would be a breach of fairness and natural justice for me to try to formulate arguments in support of this portion of the complaint and make findings thereon. The allegation of discrimination on the basis of family status has not been substantiated.\nF. The Section 10 complaint [111] Given my findings regarding the s. 7 complaint, I do not believe it is necessary to address the claim that the CF's policy that resulted in the denial of funding for IVF treatment, was also in breach of s. 10. The evidence adduced in this case has led to a finding of discrimination under s. 7. Where a complaint has been substantiated, the tribunal is authorized to issue remedial orders, including all of those being sought by the CHRC and Mr. Buffett in the present case, pursuant to s. 53 of the Act. One of the specific orders being sought in this case, requesting a change in the CF's IVF funding policy, can be made whether the complaint is substantiated under s. 7 or s. 10 (see Moore v. Canadian Grain Commission, 2006 CHRT 38 at paras. 5, 7-10; Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1 at paras. 15-16). I do not see the necessity, therefore, to address Mr. Buffett's allegation of discrimination pursuant to s. 10 of the Act.\n[112] I would note in passing, however, that a question could be raised about whether CF's denial of coverage for IVF treatments can be construed, pursuant to s. 10 of the Act, as a potential deprival of an employment opportunity or les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement, in the French version of the Act. This question was, however, not brought up or debated by the parties at the hearing into the complaint, and given my earlier findings, I do not believe that any s. 10 finding is required.\nG. What remedial orders are Mr. Buffett and the Commission seeking? (i) An order that the employment benefit be provided to Mr. Buffett [113] The Tribunal may, pursuant to s. 53(2)(b), order a respondent to make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that were denied the victim as a result of the practice. Accordingly, Mr. Buffett and the Commission request that the CF be ordered to provide him with funding for IVF treatments with ICSI for himself and his spouse, Rhonda Buffett.\n[114] The evidence of the medical experts who testified in this case suggested that IVF treatments may not be suitable for some patients. The age of both the man and the woman may be an important factor in the decision to prescribe these treatments. In the present case, Mr. and Ms. Buffett are both in their 40's. Keeping this in mind, any order from the Tribunal regarding the funding of such treatments should of course be conditional on the recommendations and advice of the couple's reproductive technology specialist. Consequently, if their specialist continues to recommend that Mr. and Ms. Buffett obtain IVF treatments with ICSI, and they opt to do so, the CF is ordered to fund these treatments, to a maximum of three cycles. The CF's obligation is to provide employment benefits to its employees in a substantively equal and non-discriminatory manner. Under the existing policy, women with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction are offered coverage for up to three cycles of IVF treatment. Mr. Buffett is entitled to an equal number of cycles of IVF treatment with ICSI.\n(ii) Compensation for pain and suffering - s. 53(2)(e) of the Act [115] Mr. Buffett testified that what he has experienced has taken an extreme toll on him. Of course, as the CF pointed out in final arguments, much of this toll was due to the simple fact that his infertility problems have prevented him and his wife from having children. He testified of the pain both of them have felt witnessing the joy that relatives and others around them were sharing with their children, a joy in which they were not able to partake. The CF argues that consequently, Mr. Buffett's pain and suffering is not linked to the CF's IVF funding practices, which I have determined to have been discriminatory, but rather to his own personal situation and fate.\n[116] Yet, the expert evidence would suggest that had the CF provided Mr. Buffett with the employment benefit of funding for the treatments that he had requested as early as 1998 (when he and his wife were still in their 30's), it is very possible they would have had children years ago. Had they undergone a successful treatment, the pain and suffering that he continues to experience would have ceased. Of course, it is not certain that the treatments would have yielded a successful pregnancy, but the possibility exists just the same.\n[117] In my view, Mr. Buffett is entitled to compensation for the pain and suffering that might have ceased had the CF not denied him funding in a discriminatory manner.\n[118] In addition, Mr. Buffett testified as to the emotional highs and lows that he experienced because of the contradictory decisions and opinions that he received as his grievance progressed through the ranks until it reached the Chief of Defence Staff. The happiness that Mr. Buffett enjoyed whenever he received endorsements for his position from a senior officer would later be completely displaced by utter sadness when the next reviewing officer would turn his request down.\n[119] Taking all of these circumstances into account, I order the CF to pay Mr. Buffett $7,500 in compensation for his pain and suffering.\n(iii) Interest [120] Interest is payable in respect of the monetary award made in this decision (s. 53(4) of the Act). The interest shall be calculated in accordance with Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure, and it shall run from the date of Mr. Buffett's initial grievance, November 10, 1998.\n(iv) An order that the CF cease its discriminatory practice [121] The Commission and Mr. Buffett have requested that the Tribunal order the CF to cease its discriminatory practice and take measures to redress the practice or prevent it from occurring in the future. The Commission seemed to suggest that the CF should be required to amend its policy so as to make funding available for IVF treatment for all its members on an indefinite basis.\n[122] In my view, such an order would be inappropriate. The CF has been found liable for having failed to provide an employment benefit to all its employees in a substantively equal and non-discriminatory manner. It is not for the Tribunal in this case to dictate which procedures the CF should be funding. However, for as long as the CF maintains its policy of funding IVF treatments for the benefit of any of its members who experience infertility, it must do so in a non-discriminatory fashion, in accordance with the findings in this decision.\n[123] With this understanding in mind, and pursuant to s. 53(2)(a), I order the CF to take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to amend its policy for the funding of IVF treatments, such that CF members with male factor infertility receive substantively equal benefits as either CF members with double fallopian tube obstruction, or all female CF members, as the case may be.\n(v) Sensitivity training [124] The Commission has requested an order to the effect that members of the CF who are responsible for the development and administration of its health care policy receive sensitivity training in respect of human rights law issues to the extent that they relate to the decisions that these individuals make. The Commission alluded specifically to the evidence before the Tribunal that at no time during the development of the policy for IVF funding nor during the development of the Spectrum of Care policy in general, did the CF seek the opinion of legal counsel. The Commission appeared to suggest that the CF's decision-making process in this regard failed to take into account the legal, and particularly human rights law, implications.\n[125] While it may be that the present dispute could have been avoided had the CF sought advice from legal counsel prior to adopting its IVF funding policy, I am not persuaded that this constitutes sufficient cause to order the sensitivity training that is being sought by the Commission. Undoubtedly, the CF and its staff will derive a good measure of understanding of the factors that should be taken into account when administering its health care policy, from the reasons of this decision alone. The Commission's request for sensitivity training is denied.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[1] The inquiry into Mr. Warman's complaint began on August 30, 2004. After 13 days of hearings into the evidence, final submissions from all parties were heard from February 23rd to February 25th, 2005. The parties were given additional time thereafter to address certain issues in writing, namely two court decisions that had just been released. Mr. Warman filed his additional submissions on March 2, 2005, and Mr. Kulbashian followed suit on March 21, 2005. The Commission opted not to send in any additional submissions. I would note that Mr. Kulbashian took this opportunity to make several additional arguments, which were unrelated to the court decisions to which he was supposed to limit his remarks.\n[2] The Tribunal thereafter took the case under advisement and is still considering its decision.\n[3] On January 3, 2006, some ten months after final oral arguments were completed, Mr. Kulbashian filed a motion to revisit a witness, which was basically a request to have Mr. Warman called to the stand again to be cross-examined by Mr. Kulbashian (Motion no. 1).\n[4] On January 4, 2006, Mr. Kulbashian filed a motion to exclude evidence against Tri-City Skins.com and Affordablespace.com from the judgment phase of the Tribunal process (Motion no. 2). In this motion, Mr. Kulbashian essentially argued that both of these respondents are not entities capable of being parties subject to a complaint under s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[5] On January 6, 2006, Mr. Kulbashian sent to the Tribunal some information about Mr. Warman and the Commission's witness, Terry Wilson, which actually consisted of supplemental documentary evidence that Mr. Kulbashian sought to introduce relating to their testimonies (Motion no. 3).\n[6] Another motion was filed on the same day, January 6, 2005 (Motion no. 4), although I think it should be more aptly characterized as additional arguments. They were to the effect that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to deal with any Internet messages that were allegedly not specifically set out in the complaint nor mentioned in the Commission investigator's report.\n[7] It seems copies of Motions 3 and 4 were not forwarded on by the Tribunal to the Commission and Mr. Warman, as has been the normal practice in this case. The Tribunal Registry is instructed to forward copies of these motions to the Commission and Mr. Warman forthwith.\n[8] On January 19, 2006, Mr. Kulbashian presented another motion, requesting that the evidence that had already been introduced at the hearing, relating to a copy of a computer's hard drive, now be excluded from this Tribunal process (Motion no. 5).\n[9] On January 20, 2006, the Commission and Mr. Warman filed their submissions in reply to Mr. Kulbashian's first two motions (of January 3 and 4, 2006). The Commission complained in its submissions of the manner in which Mr. Kulbashian has proceeded with his motions. The Commission alleges that this sequential filing of motions, which are in some ways repetitious of one another, constitutes an abuse of process. Just as Commission counsel was preparing to address one motion, another would be filed. The Commission asks the Tribunal to rule on the first two motions before compelling the Commission to devote additional effort addressing the subsequent motions.\n[10] On January 23, 2006, Mr. Kulbashian filed yet another motion, this time requesting that the Tribunal exclude evidence against the Respondent C.E.C.T. from the judgment phase of the Tribunal process (Motion no. 6). The submissions contained in this motion resemble those in Mr. Kubashian's earlier motion of January 4, 2006.\n[11] I agree with the Commission. Mr. Kulbashian has indeed inundated the other parties with a barrage of motions, at what is effectively the very last minute prior to the issuance of the decision on the merits into the complaint. In my view, the Tribunal's process is best served by the Tribunal issuing its findings on all of these motions immediately. I do not find it necessary to hear any further submissions regarding Mr. Kulbashian's motions.\nMotion no. 1 [12] In the case of Vermette v. CBC, (1994) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/89 (C.H.R.T.), aff'd (1996) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/139 (F.C.T.D.), the Tribunal addressed the issue of re-opening a hearing to adduce additional evidence. Relying on Sopinka's and Lederman's The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases, the Tribunal noted that, except in the case of fraud or surprise, the evidence that a party seeks to introduce must be newly discovered, and must be evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered during the trial. It must also be of such a character that it would have a determining factor in the result. Where the application to reopen is received prior to the decision being rendered, a broader discretion to reopen has been recognized.\n[13] In the present case, Mr. Kulbashian is not trying to adduce newly discovered evidence, as he himself acknowledged at page 2 of his motion:\nDuring the Tribunal hearing, the applicant attempted to question Richard Warman on his association with the ARA. The Commission and the witness objected, and the Tribunal ruled that there would be no cross-examination relating to his association with the ARA.\nMr. Kulbashian now wants to call Mr. Warman back to the witness stand to cross-examine him with regard to his involvement with the ARA group, which is in effect an attempt to re-introduce the same evidence. In so doing, Mr. Kulbashian is asking the Tribunal to re-visit its decision maintaining the other parties' objections to this line of questioning. I see no reason to do so. The respondents made their submissions regarding these objections when they sought to adduce the evidence at the hearing. The Tribunal considered their submissions and ruled. The ruling stands. Motion no. 1 is dismissed.\nMotion no. 2 [14] This motion strikes me more as an attempt to present additional arguments rather than a motion to exclude evidence. The fact of the matter is that this issue was already addressed by the parties during final submissions. I do not see anything fundamentally new in the way of argument in what Mr. Kulbashian has submitted in his motion. In any event, I would view any attempt to re-argue the case at this time as unfair and an abuse of process.\n[15] Final oral submissions were conducted over three days in February 2005. Mr. Kulbashian's argument lasted about one hour on the first day, took up the entirety of the following day, and continued into the final day for an additional fifty minutes. The co-respondent, Mr. Richardson, followed with his own arguments that ran for approximately one hour and twenty minutes.\n[16] In my view, Mr. Kulbashian had ample opportunity to present all of his arguments. Moreover, he took advantage of the occasion that the Tribunal afforded him and the other parties to file follow-up submissions in writing, regarding some recently court decisions. Instead of just commenting on those decisions, Mr. Kulbashian went on to write almost two single-spaced pages of additional final arguments, which had nothing to do with the decisions in question. In contrast, Mr. Warman kept himself within the guidelines set down by the Tribunal.\n[17] It is most unfair to the other parties for Mr. Kulbashian to return now, some ten months later, and attempt to re-argue his case, particularly since these arguments relate to issues that were already addressed or could reasonably have been raised during the three days' hearing on final submissions. Motion no. 2 is dismissed.\nMotion no. 3 [18] In fact, Mr. Kulbashian did not quite file a motion. Rather, he sent a series of documents to the Tribunal, asking that they be submitted to the Tribunal member who heard the case. I will nonetheless treat this as a motion to re-open the case in order to adduce new evidence.\n[19] Mr. Kulbashian states in his cover letter that the first set of documents consists of some posts made by Mr. Warman on a white supremacist forum on the Internet. Mr. Kulbashian alleges that the comments made in these posts violate s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Mr. Kulbashian does not indicate what the relevance is to the present case, nor do I perceive any. Referring back to the principles articulated in Vermette, supra, I do not see what determining factor this evidence would have in the result of this case. As I reminded both Mr. Kulbashian and Mr. Richardson repeatedly during the hearing, the matter at issue before me consists of the discriminatory practices that were allegedly conducted by the respondents, not by other persons.\n[20] The second set of attachments to Motion no. 3 relate to a complaint filed by Mr. Kulbashian with the New Westminster Police Service, which is the current employer of Commission witness, Terry Wilson. Mr. Kulbashian makes a series of allegations against Mr. Wilson in this complaint. I again fail to see any relevance in these documents, particularly since they do not contain any finding from any authority with regard to Mr. Wilson. There is only an acknowledgement from the Office of the Police Complaint Commission that the issues raised in Mr. Kulbashian's complaint can be characterized as Public Trust. As in the case of the first set of attachments, I do not see how this evidence would be a determining factor in the result of the present case.\n[21] Furthermore, I find it objectionable that Mr. Kulbashian has attempted through his correspondence with the Tribunal to deposit into the record evidence that did not come properly before the Tribunal at hearing. There is no indication that any of these documents were ever previously disclosed to the other parties, not to mention that the hearing into this case has been closed for over ten months.\n[22] Motion no. 3 is dismissed. The original correspondence from Mr. Kulbashian can remain in the Tribunal's official record, but the attachments in question will not be considered in my final disposition of the case.\nMotion no. 4 [23] Just as in Motion no. 2, Mr. Kulbashian is attempting to re-argue the case. As I indicated when addressing Motion no. 2, Mr. Kulbashian had more than ample opportunity ten months ago to address all of the issues put before the Tribunal. It would be unfair to all parties and an abuse of this Tribunal's process to permit him to re-argue his case at this late stage.\n[24] Motion no. 4 is dismissed.\nMotion no. 5 [25] This motion is again an attempt to re-visit evidence adduced during the hearing. This motion or objection could have been raised when the evidence in question was adduced at the hearing or, at the very least, could have been argued in final submissions. It is not now the time, at this extremely late stage of the inquiry process, for Mr. Kulbashian to try to go back and have evidence excluded.\n[26] Motion no. 5 is also dismissed.\nMotion no. 6 [27] This motion consists of additional arguments that closely resemble those made in motion no. 2. For the reasons already given with respect to Motion no. 2, Motion no. 6 is also dismissed.\n[28] Mr. Kulbashian has stated in footnotes to his motions that the reason for the late submission of his motions is due to his lack of legal experience. Over the course of the entire inquiry process, the Tribunal has attempted to extend to both unrepresented respondents a significant degree of accommodation on account of their legal inexperience. However, such accommodation cannot go so far as to render the process unfair and prejudicial to the other parties.\n[29] In light of my findings dismissing Mr. Kulbashian's six motions, the parties are released from filing any outstanding submissions regarding these motions that had been requested in previous correspondence from the Tribunal.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[1] In her Amended Statement of Particulars, dated June 15, 2006, the Complainant declared her intention to call Professor Patrica Monture as an expert witness in this case. She is to give evidence on discrimination in the context of the facts of this matter and in the context of her research and publications.\n[2] The Respondent objects to the Complainant adducing this evidence.\n[3] Prof. Monture is a member of the Sociology Department at the University of Saskatchewan. She outlines the substance of her proposed evidence in an expert report, which was prepared in the form of a three-page affidavit. In paragraphs 1 through 3 of the affidavit, she explains that her area of study is primarily in law and society, as well as constitutional law, including Aboriginal and Treaty rights, Aboriginal women, and criminology. She also sets out her related experience in the area.\n[4] I have reviewed the affidavit and agree with the Respondent that Prof. Monture's proposed evidence is either irrelevant, unnecessary to the Tribunal, or improperly gives evidence on the ultimate issue. The evidence should therefore be excluded.\nIrrelevant Evidence [5] The Supreme Court, in R. v. Mohan [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, described the criteria for the admissibility of expert evidence. The Court pointed out, at paragraph 18, that relevance is a threshold requirement for the admission of expert evidence, as it is with all other evidence.\n[6] In my view, a portion of Prof. Monture's evidence is clearly irrelevant, namely her opinion, found at paragraph 11 of her affidavit, to the effect that the Canadian Human Rights Commission's response to the complaint demonstrates a clear lack of understanding of Aboriginal women's experience, systemic discrimination and intersectionality.\n[7] The issue in this case is whether the evidence adduced establishes that the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice, in contravention of the Canadian Human Rights Act. I fail to see how the Commission's response to the complaint will be in any way relevant to this issue.\nUnnecessary Evidence [8] In Mohan, the Court also states, at paragraph 21, that an expert's function is to provide the judge and jury with a ready-made inference that the judge and jury, due to the technical nature of the facts, are unable to formulate. The Supreme Court went on to say that if, on the proven facts, a judge or jury can form their own conclusions without help, the experience of the expert is unnecessary.\n[9] In paragraphs 4 through 10 of the affidavit, Prof. Monture refers to literature in the area of discrimination and then purports to define the concepts of individual and systemic discrimination, as well as the intersectionality of discrimination on the basis of multiple proscribed grounds of discrimination. These concepts are matters that are regularly addressed by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in its decisions. The Tribunal's superior expertise regarding fact finding and adjudication in the human rights context has been judicially recognized (see e.g. R v. Mossop, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554).\n[10] In my view, this portion of Prof. Monture's proposed evidence falls squarely within the experience and knowledge of the Tribunal and is accordingly unnecessary.\nEvidence of the Ultimate Issue [11] In paragraph 8 of her affidavit, Prof. Monture states that in her opinion several of the incidents alleged by the complainant to have occurred while she was a member of the CF, constitute clear and obvious examples of individual discrimination. This is, in effect, her opinion on the ultimate issue that the Tribunal will be deciding in this case, i.e. whether the Complainant was the victim of a discriminatory practice.\n[12] As the Tribunal pointed out in Brooks v. Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 2004 CHRT 20, while the rule against providing an opinion on the ultimate issue has been relaxed in recent years, it must still be respected. Every adjudicative body has an obligation to reach its own conclusion on the fundamental issues in a case, without direction from the parties. In my view, this is particularly so with respect to human rights issues, regarding which the Tribunal has the above mentioned expertise and is therefore able to draw the very inferences being proposed by Prof. Monture in her report, without her help.\nConclusion [13] For all of these reasons, the proposed expert testimony of Prof. Monture and her affidavit are excluded from the evidence in this case.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Jensen Date: October 11, 2006 Citation: 2006 CHRT 41\n[1] This is a ruling regarding the venue for the hearing into the complaint brought against www.bcwhitepride.com by the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR). CRARR alleges that the Respondent, www.bcwhitepride.com, communicated hate messages over the Internet contrary to s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) and CRARR both submit that the hearing should be held either in Ottawa or in Montreal since they are located in those two cities and their two witnesses reside in Montreal and Ottawa.\n[3] Mr. Paul Fromm argued, on behalf of the Respondent, that the hearing should be held in Penticton, British Columbia. Mr. Fromm submitted that, although not a named Respondent, Mr. John Beck is the subject of a motion by the Commission to add him as a Respondent to the present complaint. Mr. Beck wishes to contest this motion. According to Mr. Fromm, Mr. Beck does not have the financial means to attend a hearing in Ottawa or Montreal. Mr. Fromm further argues that the Respondent\u2019s witness, Mr. Bernard Klatt, lives in the south Okanagan region of British Columbia. Moreover, the named Respondent, www.bcwhitepride.com, is or was ostensibly based in British Columbia.\n[4] It is the usual practice of the Tribunal to hold hearings in the place where the alleged discrimination occurred. However, in cases involving the alleged communication of hate messages over the Internet, it is difficult to determine exactly where the discrimination occurred. The Tribunal strives to accommodate the parties where it is appropriate to do so (Warman v. Canadian Heritage Alliance and Melissa Guille 2006 CHRT 17 at para 4).\n[5] In this case, there are two parties with two witnesses who would like the hearing to be in Ottawa or Montreal. On the other side, there is one party and one potential party with one witness (possibly two) who would like the hearing to take place in British Columbia. Thus, the competing demands are relatively equal on a numeric basis. However, I find that the balance of convenience favours the Respondent in this case.\n[6] For some reason, Mr. John Beck was not named as a Respondent before the complaint was referred to the Tribunal. The Commission has, however, provided notice that it will seek to have him added as a Respondent at the outset of the hearing. The Commission wants Mr. Beck to travel to Ottawa or Montreal so that it can attempt to have him added as a party. This does not seem fair. In my view, if the Commission wishes to add Mr. Beck as a party, then it must bring its motion to do so in Penticton, British Columbia.\n[7] Given that there is at least one other witness from that part of British Columbia and the Respondent is also from British Columbia, I think that it makes sense to hold the entire hearing in Penticton. Moreover, there is a plausible argument to be made that the Commission and the Complainant may well be in a better position than the Respondent and the potential Respondent to bear the costs of a hearing in a different venue.\n[8] Therefore, I direct that the hearing into this complaint be conducted in Penticton, British Columbia, or as close thereto as can be arranged by the Tribunal.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion presented by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requesting that the Tribunal order the Respondent, the Canadian Forces (the CF), to disclose material for which a claim of privilege has been asserted.\n[2] The motion is made in the context of a complaint filed by Ms. Micheline Montreuil. Ms. Montreuil considers herself to be a transgendered person. In her complaint, she alleges that the CF discriminated against her on the basis of her sex and perceived disability when they refused to allow her to enlist in the Forces in 1999.\n[3] During the Tribunal's case management process, the CF indicated that they intended to present expert medical evidence. The Tribunal directed the CF to provide the parties with a copy of the expert's report by April 24, 2006.\n[4] Three days before the report was due, the CF requested an extension of the deadline for filing the expert report. In his request for an extension, counsel for the CF indicated that he had recently been assigned to the file and that in discussions with the expert, Dr. Pierre Assalian, it was decided that the scope of the report needed to be broadened. It was also determined that Dr. Assalian should interview Ms. Montreuil.\n[5] The Tribunal granted the request for an extension and a new date of June 23, 2006 was set for the production of Dr. Assalian's report. The CF provided a copy of Dr. Assalian's report to the parties on June 22, 2006.\n[6] The Commission sought further disclosure from the CF of documents that were prepared by, or addressed to Dr. Assalian in conjunction with the expert report. The documents in question are the following:\nall reports, whether complete or preliminary, prepared by Dr. Pierre Assalian on or before April 24, 2 006; all communications, correspondence and\/or exchanges of any nature without exception between the Canadian Forces and Dr. Assalian that contributed to the formulation of the expert opinion; all other documents created by Dr. Assalian in the context of the present case.\n[7] The Respondent refused to provide the requested documents claiming that they were immune from disclosure by virtue of the right to professional secrecy.\n[8] The Commission then brought the present motion before the Tribunal. At the hearing on the motion, the Commission argued that the Tribunal should apply the common law rules regarding privilege against disclosure. According to these rules, the CF had waived its claim of privilege to the requested documents when it produced Dr. Assalian's report and stated that they would be calling him as a witness at the hearing.\n[9] The Respondent replied that, according to Quebec law, the CF did not waive its right to the confidentiality of the requested documents when it produced Dr. Assalian's Expert Report.\n[10] Section 50(4) of the Canadian Human Rights Act stipulates that the Tribunal may not admit or accept as evidence anything that would be inadmissible in a court by reason of any privilege under the law of evidence. We are not, however, at the stage in this process where the admissibility of evidence is being determined. We are at the disclosure stage of the inquiry process.\n[11] Rule 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure requires each party to serve and file a list of all documents in the party's possession for which privilege is claimed. The French version of Rule 6(1)(e) requires the parties to indicate the documents in their possession for which un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation is invoked. To be clear, I take the terms privilege (in English) and privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation (in French), as they are in the Rules, to include the concept of professional secrecy as that term is used in Quebec law.\n[12] Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure does not require the parties to produce the actual documents for which privilege is claimed. I am of the view that if a claim of privilege is challenged at the disclosure stage of the process, the Tribunal is not obliged to conclusively determine whether the claim of privilege is properly asserted or not. In circumstances such as the present case, where the issues are complex and where no evidence has been adduced with respect to the documents in question, it would not be prudent in my view, to make a definitive ruling on whether the documents are subject to a claim of privilege.\n[13] Privilege is a fundamental right which should not lightly be abrogated (Smith v. Jones, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 495 at para. 74). In Quebec, strong and generous protection is afforded to the right of professional secrecy (Foster Wheeler Power Co. v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 municipale de gestion et d'\u00e9limination des d\u00e9chets (SIGED) Inc., 2004 SCC 18 at para. 41).\n[14] Therefore, I think that it is preferable in the present circumstances to assess whether the Respondent has established a plausible argument that privilege attaches to the requested documents and that it has not been waived. If it is established that the documents in question are arguably privileged, then in my view, the Tribunal should not order the disclosure of the documents in question. It will then be up to the Tribunal member or panel hearing the case on the merits to make a conclusive determination, on the basis of the evidence and arguments presented at that time, as to whether the requested documents are in fact subject to a valid claim of privilege and, therefore, inadmissible pursuant to s. 50(4) of the Act.\n[15] The Complainant has raised the concern that if the documents are not disclosed prior to the hearing and she is successful in refuting the claim of privilege over the requested documents, she will lose the right to have these documents introduced into evidence by operation of Rule 9(3)(c) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. Rule 9(3) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure stipulates that (e)xcept with leave of the Panel a party shall not introduce a document into evidence at the hearing that has not previously been disclosed. According to my reading of this rule, the Tribunal has the authority to grant leave to the complainant to introduce documents into evidence even if they have not been disclosed prior to the hearing. Therefore, should the Tribunal decide that the claim of privilege is unfounded, it may order that the documents be disclosed and entered into evidence if it is appropriate to do so.\n[16] Is there a plausible argument to be made that privilege applies to the documents listed above and that it has not been waived? I think that the answer to this question is yes. I find that there is certain logic in the following arguments presented by counsel for the Respondent.\nSection 50(4) of the Canadian Human Rights Act does not stipulate which jurisdiction's laws of evidence are to be applied in interpreting the term privilege.\nBy operation of sections 2 and 40 of the Canada Evidence Act, the Tribunal is required to apply the law of evidence in force in the province of Quebec in the present case.\nIn Poulin v. Prat, [1994] R.D.J. 301, the Quebec Court of Appeal stated that according to Quebec law, calling an expert witness to testify does not constitute an implicit waiver of the immunity from disclosure of the notes, rough copies, drafts and other documents created by the expert in preparation for the drafting of the final report. Similarly, immunity from disclosure of the communications between the lawyer that retained the expert and the expert is not waived by calling the expert. Rather, a party may only be said to have waived the immunity with respect to the definitive opinion which forms the basis for the expert's testimony, as well as the factual sources upon which the expert drew in formulating his or her opinion.\nPoulin v. Prat has not been attenuated or modified by any subsequent decisions of the Quebec Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada. Therefore, by virtue of s. 40 of the Canada Evidence Act, Poulin v. Prat is binding upon the Tribunal.\nThe Respondent claims that the Commission has requested previous drafts of the expert's report, his notes and copies of correspondence between the expert and the lawyer that retained his services.\nThe Respondent asserts that according to Poulin v. Prat, all of these documents are immune from disclosure.\n[17] In my view, the plausibility of the Respondent's arguments on the issues is not significantly weakened by the arguments made by the Commission and the Complainant.\n[18] The Commission argued that the Tribunal should apply the common law principles regarding privilege as they were expressed by the B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver Community College v. Phillips, Barrat, (1987), 20 B.C.L.R. (2d) 289 and subsequently applied in the federal context by the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, in Canadian Council of Professional Engineers v. Memorial University of Newfoundland (1998), 159 F.T.R. 55. Vancouver Community College stands for the proposition that production from experts of documents going to substance or credibility may be required at trial when the expert is called. Assuming, however, that the common law recognizes the right to such documents at trial, there is no certainty whatsoever that such a right exists at the discovery or disclosure stage of the process (Canadian Council of Professional Engineers v. Memorial University of Newfoundland, supra, at para.1).\n[19] For these reasons, the Commission's motion for an Order requiring the Respondent to disclose the above-noted documents is denied, without prejudice to its right to raise the issue again at the hearing into the merits of the complaint.\n[20] It should be noted that my finding that the documents are arguably privileged does not mean that the documents are, in fact, privileged. It remains to be determined by the Member or panel hearing the case on the merits whether, on the basis of the evidence and arguments presented during the hearing, the requested documents are, in fact, subject to privilege and therefore, inadmissible pursuant to s. 50(4) of the CHRA.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling in response to a request by the Respondent, the Canadian Forces, for an order requiring the Complainant, Ms. Micheline Montreuil, to disclose certain documents.\n[2] The request is made in the context of a complaint filed by Ms. Montreuil. Ms. Montreuil considers herself to be a transgendered person. In her complaint, she alleges that the CF discriminated against her on the basis of her sex and perceived disability when they refused to allow her to enlist in the Forces in 1999.\n[3] The Respondent has requested the following documents:\nthe expert report of Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, dated March 18, 1998; the disability report of Dr. Jean Rodrigue, dated January 5, 1998 establishing the Complainant's inability to work from January 19, 1998 to August 19, 1998;\n[4] The Complainant states that Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9's expert report was produced in the context of a grievance that she filed against a former employer, the Coll\u00e8ge Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier-Garneau. The question in that case was whether Mr. Montreuil, as she was known at the time, was fit to consent to a settlement agreement that provided for his voluntary resignation from the Coll\u00e8ge. Mr. Montreuil maintained that he was unable to make a sound decision in that regard. He consulted with a psychiatrist, Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, who produced a report and testified on Mr. Montreuil's behalf at the arbitration. Excerpts of Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9's report appear in the Aribtrator's decision. In those excerpts, Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 makes reference to the fact that when Mr. Montreuil signed the agreement in December of 1997, he was in a state of significant distress having been confronted, for the first time in his life, with his double identity. It would appear that when he was referring to double identity Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 was referring to Mr. Montreuil's sexual identity.\n[5] The disability report by Dr. Rodrigue is purportedly a document that was submitted to an insurance company in support of an application for insurance coverage for the period from December 1997 to August 1998, during which Mr. Montreuil was unable to work due to the psychological difficulties referred to above.\n[6] In response to the Respondent's request for disclosure of the above-noted documents, Ms. Montreuil asserts that the requested documents are not relevant to the present proceedings and are subject to the right of professional secrecy. Therefore, they should not be disclosed.\n[7] I agree with the Respondent that the documents are arguably relevant to the present proceedings. Ms. Montreuil's fitness to serve in the Canadian Forces is in issue in this case. The requested documents relate to psychological difficulties that would appear to flow, at least in part, from issues regarding her sexual identity. The documents allegedly relate to the fact that as a result of these difficulties, Ms. Montreuil was unable to work for the better part of 1998. This was one year prior to her attempt to enlist in the Canadian Forces on June 30, 1999.\n[8] What is less clear, however, is whether these particular documents are subject to privilege or professional secrecy, as this term is employed in Quebec law. This point has not been properly addressed by the parties. Ms. Montreuil has alleged that the documents are subject to professional secrecy, but she has not made any argument with respect to this issue. The submissions of counsel for the Respondent and counsel for the Canadian Human Rights Commission deal principally with the issue of relevance. None of the parties have addressed the issues regarding privilege that arise in the context of this particular request.\n[9] Having regard to these considerations, the matter will be addressed at the hearing on the merits of the case which is due to commence on October 23, 2006.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] On Friday, October 13, 2006, the Tribunal received a request for an adjournment from the Complainant and the Commission in the present case. The reason for the request was that the Respondent had disclosed, on October 12, 2006, five volumes of documents. Counsel for the Commission and the Complainant vigorously objected to the late disclosure of such a large quantity of documents and stated that they would be unable to properly prepare their cases as a result. The Complainant asked that the hearing be postponed until December 4, 2006 and that new dates for the continuation of the hearing be fixed in 2007.\n[2] The Respondent objected to the request for the adjournment, stating that many of the documents were known to the parties and that they were exaggerating the amount of work that was required to review the documents.\n[3] This request is yet another in a series of pre-hearing requests made by the parties. As the Tribunal decided in previous rulings on disclosure in this case, the present request by the Commission and the Complainant is best left to the Member or Panel hearing the merits of the case. At that time, it may be clearer as to which documents the Respondent intends to rely upon, which documents are truly new in that they have not previously been disclosed, and which documents, if any, must be reviewed by the experts.\n[4] If prejudice is established, it may be that Rule 9(3) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure will apply. It may also be that the Tribunal will be able to find practical ways to accommodate the parties' concerns.

On September 13, 2006, the Tribunal received a letter from Mr. Paul Fromm, who during the hearing had acted, with the consent of the Tribunal, as a representative for the Respondent, Terry Tremaine. In this letter, Mr. Fromm requested that the case be re-opened to allow him to make a motion requesting that the complaint of Mr. Richard Warman be dismissed because of a poisoned environment and harassment on him, as representative of the Respondent, Terry Tremaine.\n[2] Submissions in opposition to Mr. Fromm's request were received from the Complainant and the Commission.\n[3] I will not deal with the allegations contained in Mr. Fromm's letter as they are not relevant to any of the issues raised in the complaint and furthermore the parties referred to in this letter were not parties to the complaint. If I was to re-open the case as requested, I would be dealing with a totally new issue concerning new parties. I also take notice of the fact that the Respondent, Terry Tremaine, did not address the Tribunal on this matter or indicate how these events might have affected his case. I must add though that even if he had brought this matter to my attention, there would have been no justification for a re-opening of the case on the basis of those allegations. I fail to see the connection between the allegations made by Mr. Fromm in his letter and the issues that I have to deal with in my decision.\n[4] For these reasons the request of Mr. Fromm's that the case be re-opened is denied.\n[5] In its Reply to Mr. Fromm's letter the Commission also sought remedies from the Tribunal. In particular it sought an Order that no further motions be introduced by the Respondent without obtaining the prior authorization from the Tribunal. Since there is no motion or evidence before the Tribunal, I see no reason to deal with this request at this time.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nOctober 17, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1104\/8505\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRichard Warman v.

Afternoon now.\nThe Registrar: Be seated.\nThe Chairperson: I am going to address the motion that was put before us this morning. And I have got it written out, so I will just read it.\nIn the within complaint, the complainant alleged that the respondents violated Section 13.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act on numerous grounds: religion, race, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation.\nThe respondent's representative has brought a motion this morning seeking an order that this member recuse herself by reason of a reasonable apprehension of bias.\nFirst, I will note that there is no evidence tendered in support of this motion. The respondent's representative includes in his motion numerous extracts of what purports to be media clippings taken from the internet. The evidence was not tendered or put forward in proper form.\nThe law is clear that the threshold is high because there is a presumption of neutrality.\nThe onus of demonstrating bias lies with the person alleging its existence, and an allegation must be supported by material evidence.\nHere, the respondent's representative elected not to tender such evidence. The respondent's application must fail for that reason, and I so find.\nFurther, however, and in the alternative, even if the material included in the respondent's statement of facts is taken at face value, I find that an allegation of bias has not been made out.\nFirst, there's been no suggestion made by the respondent's representative that this member has demonstrated any bias in the present hearing, two-and-a-half days of which have now concluded.\nFurther, there's been no suggestion of any direct interest or connection between this member and this case or the parties before the tribunal.\nThe respondent's representative instead relies on the media articles, which would suggest a number of things:\nFirst, that this member has represented clients who are members of minority groups enumerated in the Canadian Human Rights Act, including gay and lesbian clients; that this member has made public comments in support of minority groups enumerated in the Canadian Human Rights Act, including the rights of gays and lesbians; third, that the member herself may be a member of the minority group enumerated in the Canadian Human Rights Act and in particular, may be a lesbian; finally, that this member made a comment in relation to a private member's Bill considered by the Alberta Legislative Assembly.\nThe respondent's representative identified that, in particular, the following comment is particularly indicative of bias, and that is, People are allowed to have their private opinions, but they are not allowed to discriminate in a public sphere.\nSo first with respect to the law, and we've canvassed that this morning. The law with respect to an apprehension of bias addresses a concern that's central. It is central to the administration of justice that parties to an adjudication are entitled to a hearing by an adjudicator who is fair and who is impartial.\nThe tests for assessing allegations of bias or apprehension thereof have been set out clearly by the Courts.\nBut first, there's an important distinction to be drawn, and that is drawn in the cases between judicial neutrality and judicial impartiality. The former, judicial neutrality, is simply not possible. The latter, judicial impartiality, is critical to the fair administration of administrative process.\nJustices L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 and McLachlin in the decision of R v. RDS, 1997, 3 SCR, 484, discuss at length a very important, critical distinction between these two concepts, and I am turning to page 34 of that decision.\nI am going to read some of it, because it is particularly critical to this determination.\nMadam Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 and McLachlin identifies as follows: In order to apply the test -- and this is the test for an apprehension of bias -- it is necessary to distinguish between the impartiality which is required of all judges and the concept of judicial neutrality. The distinction which would draw that is reflected in the insightful words of Benjamin N. Cardozo in the Nature of the Judicial Process, at page 12 and 13 and 167, where he affirmed the importance of impartiality while at the same time recognizing the fallacy of judicial neutrality.\nMr. Cardozo is quoted as follows:\nThere is in each of us the stream of tendency, whether you choose to call it philosophy or not, which gives coherence and direction to thought and action. Judges cannot escape that current any more than other mortals. All their lives, forces which do not recognize and cannot name have been tugging at them \u2013 inherited instincts, traditional beliefs, acquired convictions -- and the resultant is an outlook on life, a conception of social needs. In this mental background, every problem finds its setting. We may try to see things as objectively as we please. Nonetheless, we can never see them with any eyes except our own. Deep below consciousness are other forces, the likes and dislikes, the predilections and the prejudices, the complex of instincts and emotions and habits and convictions, which make the person, whether he or she be litigant or judge.\nCardozo recognised that objectivity was an impossibility, because judges, like all other humans, operate from their own perspectives. As the Canadian Judicial Counsel noted in commentaries on judicial conduct, there is no human being who is not the product of every social experience, every process of education, and every human contact. What is possible and desirable is impartiality. And it is impartiality that is requirement of this proceeding. That this member has engaged in advocacy for human rights may lead one to conclude that she, like others, is not neutral. It does not, however, lead to the conclusion that she is impartial.\nAnd now we need to turn to the test, and the test for an apprehension of bias and the manner in which that is to be analysed, I am going to start, again, with the decision of .R v. RDS, and this is at page 12. And the test is that of an informed reasonable person. So the test is:\nWhat would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through, conclude? Would he or she think that it is more likely than not that the decision-maker, consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly?\nI am also instructed by the reasons of the Federal Court of Appeal in Z\u00fcndel at Paragraph 36 that:\nThe reasonable person must bean informed person with knowledge of all relevant circumstances, including the traditions of integrity and impartiality that form part of the background and apprised also of the fact that impartiality is one of the duties the judges swear to uphold. The threshold is high.\nThe onus of establishing an apprehension of bias is on the one alleging.\nAnd further in the Z\u00fcndel decision is they have referenced to an Ontario Court of Appeal decision in E.A. Manning Limited, and it is identified there that it must be presumed in the absence of any evidence to the contrary that the commissions will act fairly and impartially in discharging their adjudicative responsibilities and will consider particular facts and circumstances of each case.\nBefore we turn to the facts, the allegations in this particular application, we need to ask ourselves, Would these facts in each of them make a reasonable person believe that this member will not fairly and impartially consider all of the evidence and will not fairly and impartially apply the relevant law to the evidence as it is found?\nAnd we must consider the instructions from the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. RDS about the nature of that reasonable person. And at Paragraph 48, the reasonable person is a person who approaches the question of whether there exists a reasonable apprehension of bias with a complex and contextualized understanding of the issues in the case.\nThe reasonable person is cognisant of the social dynamics -- and I am paraphrasing with the word social -- social dynamics in a local community and is a member of the Canadian community and supportive of the principles of equality.\nThat having been said, let us turn to the facts alleged by the respondent's representative and ask whether this reasonable person, the reasonable person that Madam Justice L'Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 and McLachlin identified for us.\nWould this reasonable person think that the member would not, for reason of bias, be able to decide fairly and impartially the matter before the tribunal?\nFirst, there was a suggestion that this member may be a member of one of the five grounds upon which this complaint is brought. Is that a fact that would lead a reasonable person, our reasonable 1 person, to decide that there be an apprehension of bias?\nIn my view, this reasonable person would not conclude that a person's identity compromises their ability to consider this matter fairly and impartially. And, frankly, to find otherwise would be profoundly contrary to the principles of the quality paramount under this act, the Canadian Human Rights Act and, according to Madam Justices L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 and McLachlin, the very fabric of Canadian society.\nSecond, that the member may have represented clients who are members of minority groups protected under the Canadian Human Rights Act including gays and lesbians, would our reasonable person conclude bias from that fact?\nAnd it is hard -- I cannot see how that could possibly give rise to an apprehension of bias as adjudicators who either are or have been lawyers represent clients. The identity of those clients cannot reasonably be found to dictate, compromise, or express an adjudicator's ability to be impartial with respect to the facts in front of them.\nAnd I was particularly struck by Mr. Vigna's observation that criminal lawyers would have a very difficult time becoming judges at all if they were identified with their clients.\nThirdly, that the member made public comment in support of human rights, support of the rights of gays and lesbians in particular. And, again, this may go to neutrality. Again, there's an important distinction: This may go to neutrality, not to impartiality.\nAnd, further, the laws in this country, including the Canadian Human Rights Act itself, are expressly intended to foster the rights of minority groups. Comments consonant with this fundamental principle of Canadian society cannot, in my view, amount to a reasonable apprehension of bias.\nAnd, finally, with respect to the particular comment, People are allowed to have their private opinions, but they are not allowed to discriminate in a public sphere, that is a correct articulation of the laws of Canada as articulated in the Canadian Human Rights Act and in the Human Rights Act of other provinces in this country. And so, again, such a statement cannot give rise to an apprehension of bias.\nFor those reasons, the motion is denied.\nSigned by\nJulie Lloyd Tribunal Member\nEdmonton, Alberta May 25, 2006\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal Files: T1087\/6805 et T1088\/6905\nStyle of Cause: Richard Warman v.

Air Canada's position is that ACPA should be added as a respondent.\n[4] The Tribunal also received an application dated June 20, 2006, from Fly Past 60 Coalition, a group of pilots or former pilots of Air Canada, asking to be added as an interested party to the complaint.\n[5] The Commission consented to the application by the Fly Past 60 Coalition. Air Canada opposed it as did ACPA. ACPA did not feel in any way constrained in opposing the Coalition's application even though it has no status or standing to do so.\n[6] I have reviewed the two applications and the responses of the parties to the complaint. I have concluded that ACPA should be added as an interested party. It is a signatory to the collective agreement with Air Canada which contains provisions relating the mandatory retirement of Air Canada pilots. As such, it has an obvious interest in these proceedings.\n[7] I've also concluded that Fly Past 60 Coalition should be added as an interested party. In this regard, I refer to and adopt the reasoning of Commission counsel in his letter of July 12, 2006 setting out the reasons why the Commission supports the Coalition's application.\n[8] Both ACPA and the Fly Past 60 Coalition will be permitted to fully participate in the hearing of this complaint before the Tribunal, including the introduction of evidence and cross-examination of witnesses, to the extent that such participation is not duplicative of the evidence and submissions of the Commission, the Complainant or Air Canada.\n[9] The schedule for disclosure for the Complainant, the Commission and Air Canada will remain the same. The schedule for APCA and Coalition disclosure will be as set out in their applications.

Hadjis\n[1] The Respondent, Marc Lemire, has filed a motion requesting an order that the Complainant, Richard Warman, be added as a respondent in the present case.\n[2] According to Mr. Warman's human rights complaint, dated November 23, 2003, Mr. Lemire is the owner of an Internet website called freedomsite.org, on which one could allegedly view hate messages (i.e. material that is proscribed under s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act). Mr. Warman also alleges in the complaint that Mr. Lemire posted some of this material himself.\n[3] With the present motion, Mr. Lemire is in effect attempting to introduce his own human rights complaint against Mr. Warman. He is claiming that Mr. Warman wrote and posted hate messages of his own on the very same website, freedomsite.org. Mr. Lemire argues that Mr. Warman should therefore be added as an additional respondent in the present case.\nDoes the Tribunal have the authority to add a party to an existing inquiry? [4] Although the Act does not explicitly state that the Tribunal has the power to order the addition of a party to a proceeding before it, s. 48.9(2)(b) provides that the Chairperson of the Tribunal may make rules of procedure governing the addition of parties and interested persons to the proceedings.\n[5] In an oral ruling in Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission (October 2, 2002), Ottawa, T701\/0602 (C.H.R.T.), referred to in Brown v. National Capital Commission, 2003 CHRT 43 and in Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, section locale 5044 du SCFP v. Telus Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., 2003 CHRT 31 (Telus), then Tribunal Chairperson Mactavish observed how s. 48.9(2)(b) of the Act specifically contemplates the addition of both parties and interested persons to existing Tribunal inquiries. Given the wording of this provision, she concluded that Parliament's intention was to empower the Tribunal to add parties to an inquiry on motion where the Tribunal deems it appropriate.\n[6] Chairperson Mactavish issued a subsequent oral ruling in the same case, on October 3, 2002, in which she noted that the legislative context surrounding the Tribunal's discretionary power to add parties suggests that any such discretion should be exercised with caution. The addition of a party during the course of an inquiry may deprive the new respondent of the benefit of certain procedural protections. These would include the opportunity to persuade the Commission during its investigation process that it should refuse to deal with the complaint because, for instance, the complaint is without merit or it is based on acts or omissions that occurred more than one year before the receipt of the complaint (s. 41(1)(e)). Thus, the Tribunal found that although the legislative scheme permits the Tribunal to add a respondent, the situations under which this will be permitted are somewhat limited in view of the loss of procedural protections that could result from such an action.\n[7] The Tribunal in Telus, at para. 30, endorsed the cautious approach articulated in Desormeaux, and concluded that the forced addition of a new respondent would be appropriate where it is established that the presence of the new party is necessary to dispose of the complaint before the Tribunal and that it was not reasonably foreseeable, once the complaint was filed with the Commission, that the addition of a new respondent would be necessary to dispose of the complaint. As was noted in Brown, at para. 20, this is accepted as the state of the current law on the question.\nIs the addition of Mr. Warman as a respondent necessary to dispose of the complaint that is before the Tribunal? [8] Mr. Lemire has not convinced me that the addition of Mr. Warman as a respondent is necessary to dispose of the complaint that is before me at this time. The complaint alleges that Mr. Lemire is the registered owner of the freedomsite.org website and that he has discriminated against persons or groups of persons on prohibited grounds by repeatedly communicating hate messages, in his capacity as webmaster and owner of this Internet website, and through his own personal postings on the website.\n[9] In what way can the inclusion of Mr. Warman as an additional respondent assist in the disposition of this complaint? Mr. Lemire's only argument on this point would appear to be that Mr. Warman posted his alleged hate messages as a way to entrap persons like Mr. Lemire, against whom he has subsequently laid human rights complaints. I gather that Mr. Lemire's point is that by making these alleged postings on the website, Mr. Warman somehow enticed others to post hate messages of their own.\n[10] It appears to me that this argument is being presented as a defence to the allegations of discriminatory practices that have been made in the complaint. If there is any merit under the Act to such a defence, it would seem to me that it could be raised by a respondent whether or not the alleged inciter to commit the discriminatory practice is named as an additional respondent in the case.\n[11] Mr. Lemire claims to find support for his position in the Brown ruling, where the Tribunal allowed the addition of a third party to a complaint. However, the circumstances of the Brown case are very different from those of the present case. The complainant, Mr. Brown, was disabled. He had alleged that the National Capital Commission (NCC) had discriminated against him by failing to provide wheelchair access to a park in Ottawa that was within the responsibility of the NCC. He claimed that the only available access was via a long set of steps, known as the York Street Steps. During the course of the hearing, evidence was adduced suggesting that a possible solution to the problem was to provide public access to an elevator situated in a nearby building owned by the federal Department of Public Works and Government Services (Public Works). The Commission made a motion requesting that the Tribunal order the addition of Public Works as a co-respondent.\n[12] The Tribunal held that in the event that Mr. Brown's complaint was ultimately found to be substantiated, the addition of Public Works might be necessary in order to implement a viable solution to the problem arising from the York Street Steps. Given the evidence that the elevator in Public Works' building could provide the access needed to remedy the discriminatory practice, Public Works would have had an indispensable part to play in resolving any question of discrimination (Brown at para. 43). In the facts of the Brown case, therefore, the Tribunal faced the real possibility that without the added party's full participation in the case, the Tribunal would have been unable to order an effective remedy to the discriminatory practice.\n[13] The same cannot be said of the present case. It has not been demonstrated to me how the Tribunal's ability to issue effective remedial orders against Mr. Lemire under the Actwill be hampered by not adding Mr. Warman as a respondent in the present case, nor has it been demonstrated that the participation of Mr. Warman as a respondent is necessary or indispensable to the resolution of any question of discrimination raised in Mr. Warman's complaint.\n[14] If Mr. Lemire is of the view that Mr. Warman has contravened the Act, he is free to file his own human rights complaint with the Commission. The Tribunal is, however, seized at this time with a complaint filed by Mr. Warman against Mr. Lemire. The addition of Mr. Warman as a respondent is not necessary to dispose of the complaint. Mr. Lemire's motion is dismissed.\n[15] Finally, I note that a good portion of the parties' submissions on the motion dealt with the technical workings of the website and the alleged evidence of Mr. Warman's visits to the website's message board. Given my findings on the inappropriateness of adding Mr. Warman as a respondent in the present case, these questions need not be addressed at this time.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Grant Sinclair\n2006 CHRT 49 2006\/11\/15\n(i) Mowat - Ruling on legal expenses [1] In her complaint dated June 15, 1998, filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Donna Mowat alleged that the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) discriminated against her on the grounds of sex,\nby adversely differentiating against her in employment and refusing to continue her employment with the CAF, contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act; and by failing to provide her with a harassment free workplace contrary to s. 14 of the Act. Included in her harassment complaint is an allegation of sexual harassment.\n[2] Ms. Mowat also alleged retaliation under s. 14.1 of the Act. This allegation was heard as a preliminary motion and dismissed by the Tribunal.\n[3] In her Statement of Particulars filed with the Tribunal, Ms. Mowat claimed compensation of $430,685 (not including unspecified amounts for CPP contributions, CAF pension, mental suffering and punitive bad faith damages) and excluding legal costs.\n[4] The Tribunal found that Ms. Mowat's sexual harassment complaint was substantiated and awarded her $4,000 plus interest for pain and suffering. The Tribunal dismissed all of her other allegations of discrimination.\n[5] The hearing of Ms. Mowat's complaint consumed about 6 weeks of hearing time. The case consumed over 4,000 pages of transcript evidence. In addition, there were more than 200 exhibits filed with the Tribunal.\n[6] The Tribunal noted in its decision that, apart from Ms. Mowat's allegation of sexual harassment, the case was marked by a fundamental lack of precision in identifying the theory of her case. The Tribunal also noted that it would have been very helpful if she had particularized the facts upon which she was relying and had identified the nexus between these facts and the prohibited grounds of discrimination.\n[7] Clearly the great majority of the evidence and exhibits introduced by Ms. Mowat related to the allegations of adverse treatment in employment, failure of the CAF to continue to employ her and harassment (other than sexual harassment) all of which were all dismissed.\n[8] Ms. Mowat now seeks to be reimbursed for her legal expenses. There are three legal accounts submitted to the Tribunal by Feehely, Gastaldi, Ms. Mowat's counsel, covering the period of March 27, 2003 to October 24, 2005. These accounts total $196,313. Ms. Mowat also claims $800 for legal fees paid to Gahrns, Lalibert\u00e9 for legal services preceding her June 15, 1998 complaint.\n[9] Both parties made oral and written submissions to the Tribunal on the question of legal costs. Initially, Ms. Mowat claimed costs on a substantial indemnity basis, or alternatively, on a partial indemnity scale. In her submissions to the Tribunal, she advised that she did not expect 100%, or even 75% of her legal fees, but did expect to be awarded reasonable costs whether she was totally or partially successful.\n[10] CAF disputed the Tribunal's jurisdiction to award costs. If, however, the Tribunal did find jurisdiction, CAF argued that Ms. Mowat be denied any legal costs or that her costs be strictly limited. This is because Ms. Mowat was for the most part unsuccessful in her allegations. Further, the hearing was unnecessarily prolonged and complicated as a result of a lack of clear articulation of her complaints.\nJurisdiction of the Tribunal to Award Legal Costs [11] If the Tribunal has jurisdiction to award legal costs, this jurisdiction must be found in ss. 53(2)(c) or 53(2)(d) of the Act, whereby the Tribunal can order compensation . . . for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[12] There are five Federal Court decisions dealing with whether this Tribunal can order compensation for legal expenses under the Act. But there is no unanimity on this question. Chronologically the cases are as follows.\n[13] Canada (Attorney General) v. Thwaites, (1994) 3 F.C. 38 involved a claim under s. 53(2)(c) for reasonable costs of counsel including costs for actuarial services. The Court agreed with the Tribunal that the complainant should be given these costs. The ordinary meaning of expenses incurred should not be restricted. Nor need the terms costs\/costs of counsel be specifically identified in the legislation. The words of the Act should be given their ordinary meaning unless the context requires otherwise.\n[14] After Thwaites came Canada (Attorney General) v. Lambie, (1996), 124 F.T.R. 303. In Lambie, at issue was compensation under s. 53(2)(d) for leave and time spent by the complainant to develop and prepare his complaint. The Federal Court rejected the claim for compensation, saying that the word expense can only cover time spent in preparation in exceptional circumstances. There was no evidence that the leave and preparation time in this case was exceptional. Parliament could have easily included in the Act the jurisdiction to award costs, but did not do so.\n[15] The Federal Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Green (2000), 183 F.T.R. 161, came to essentially the same conclusion as it did in Lambie. The Tribunal had ordered the complainant be compensated for the costs of legal advice and there was evidence that the complainant had retained professional services to assist in the preparation of submissions to the CHRC for its deliberation in its decision-making process. The Court reasoned that s. 53(2)(d) makes no mention of legal costs and this indicates that Parliament did not intend the Tribunal to have the power to award legal costs.\n[16] In both Attorney General of Canada v. Stevenson, (2003), FCT 341 and Attorney General of Canada v. Brooks, (2006), FC 500, the Federal Court concluded the opposite, and agreed with Thwaites.\n[17] The complainant in Stevenson asked under s. 53(2)(c) for costs of counsel consulted with regard to the possibility of filing a complaint with the CHRC and for the costs of legal assistance for submissions made to the CHRC.\n[18] The Federal Court concluded that legal expenses incurred when a complainant consults a lawyer regarding the well-foundedness of his complaint are entirely justifiable. And counsel costs\/legal costs incurred for filing a complaint constitute expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[19] The absence of the term legal costs or costs of counsel in s. 53(2)(c) is not determinative. The language of the section is broad enough to include the power to award legal costs. As support for this position, the Court referred to s. 50(1) of the Act saying that it clearly contemplates that a complainant can retain counsel for direction and advice.\n[20] As for Lambie, Stevenson interpreted Lambie as deciding that the Tribunal does have jurisdiction to award legal costs, but only in exceptional cases. The leave and time compensated there did not amount to exceptional circumstances.\n[21] Dealing with Green, the Stevenson Court noted that there was no finding in that case whether there were any exceptional circumstances to justify the claim.\n[22] Also of importance in Stevenson is the Court's acknowledgement of the underlying policy considerations enunciated in the Tribunal decision in Nkwazi v. Correctional Services Canada, (2001) C.H.R.D. No. 29 (Q.L.).\n[23] There the Tribunal concluded that there are compelling policy considerations relating to access to the human rights adjudication process which favour the adoption of the Thwaites approach. Interpreting the term `expenses' in the narrow and restricted way that Lemieux J. did in Green, so as to deny victims of discriminatory practices the right to recover their reasonable legal expenses associated with the pursuit of their complaints would be contrary to the public policy underlying the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[24] In Brooks, the claim was under s. 53(2)(c) for legal costs relating to litigation before the Tribunal. In its decision, the Court referenced the extensive analysis of the case law undertaken by the Stevenson Court and agreed with Stevenson that there is no reason to restrict the ordinary meaning of any expenses incurred so as to exclude expenses of litigation, prosecution or other legal transaction.\n[25] The Court rejected the suggestion that Stevenson should be read as allowing only the legal costs leading up to legal action. The Tribunal can award not only those costs, but also costs for the ongoing legal expenses of litigation.\n[26] Again in Brooks, the Court referred to and in my view, endorsed, the policy considerations set out in the Brooks Tribunal decision. Namely, that the Tribunal has the obligation to protect the efficacy and integrity of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The entire purpose of the Act is to provide a meaningful remedy for those who have suffered discrimination. I do not see how this is possible, at least in a case where the Commission decides not to appear, without an award of costs...\nCONCLUSION ON JURISDICTION [27] The predominance of authority from the Federal Court (Thwaites, Stevenson and Brooks) is that the Tribunal has the power to award legal costs under s. 53(2) of the Act. Even Lambie, according to Stevenson, recognized that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to award legal costs in exceptional circumstances.\n[28] On the basis of these authorities, I conclude that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to award legal costs under s. 53(2)(c) of the Act.\n[29] But it is not only from these decisions that I reach this conclusion. I also rely on the policy considerations set out in the Tribunal's decisions in Nkwazi and Brooks that were specifically referred to by the Federal Court in Stevenson and Brooks. I agree that, absent the power in the Tribunal to award legal costs where a complaint of a discriminatory practice is substantiated, such a finding would amount to no more than a pyrrhic victory for the complainant. A result of this nature would frustrate the remedial provisions and purpose of the Act.\nWHAT IS A REASONABLE AWARD OF COSTS IN THIS CASE? [30] Section 53(2) requires that the legal costs must be incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice. In this case, the practice in question was the sexual harassment of Ms. Mowat by the CAF. The case law establishes that the Tribunal can award pre-hearing legal costs and costs for ongoing legal representation.\n[31] In determining the legal costs award, I have considered three sources: the description of the legal services set out in the legal accounts submitted for Ms. Mowat; the quantity of evidence and number of exhibits submitted at the hearing relating to the sexual harassment allegation, relative to the total evidence and exhibits for the dismissed allegations; and the Bill of Costs submitted by each party calculated on a party\/party basis.\n[32] I am mindful that the Tribunal in Brooks used as a guideline the Federal Court Rules on the assessment of costs, specifically Rule 400(3).\n[33] On the question of the assessment of costs (not the jurisdiction question) the Federal Court quashed the Tribunal's decision. The reason was that the Tribunal, having referenced the Federal Court Rules, failed to take into account written offers of settlement of the respondent which it is required under to do Rules 400(3) and 420(2).\n[34] However, I do not read anything in the Federal Court's decision in Brooks that requires the Tribunal to apply or even reference the Federal Court Rules when making an award of costs. I have not done so in this case.\n[35] On the basis of the sources referred to above and the parties' oral and written submissions, I award Ms. Mowat the amount of $47,000 for legal costs under s. 53(2)(c) of the Act.\n[36] Ms. Mowat asked for interest on the award of costs. Interest is not an expense under s. 53(2) of the Act. The Tribunal, under s. 53(4), has the discretion to make such an award and may do so to make whole the victim of a discriminatory practice. It is not clear from the evidence whether Ms. Mowat has paid any of the legal accounts which she has received (other than the $800 account from Gahrns, Lalibert\u00e9) or has paid any interest on outstanding legal accounts. Accordingly, Ms. Mowat's interest claim to the date of this decision is denied.\n[37] However, I do order that interest be paid on the costs award from the date of this decision to the date of payment of the award, calculated in accordance with Rule 9(12)(a) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure.\nSigned by\nJ.

The Discretionary Factors\nIV. ORDER\n[1] On September 27, 2000, Ken O'Connor filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) alleging that the Canadian National Railway Company (CN) had violated s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by discriminating against him in the course of his employment on the basis of his disability.\n[2] On October 4, 2004, the Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal for further inquiry. CN is now requesting that the Tribunal exercise its discretion to refuse to hear Mr. O'Connor's complaint on the basis that the matter has already been conclusively determined at a grievance arbitration. CN invokes the doctrines of issue estoppel and abuse of process on this motion.\nI. BACKGROUND [3] Mr. O'Connor began working for CN at Capreol, Ontario in April of 1980 as a Track Maintainer. In 1981, he suffered a lower back injury while at work. As a result of a serious reoccurrence of that injury in 1987, he subsequently underwent two back operations.\n[4] Mr. O'Connor was assessed by the then Workers' Compensation Board (now the Workers' Insurance and Safety Board (WSIB) and, in 1992, he was granted a 20% permanent partial disability pension (PPD pension). This pension carried with it the following permanent work restrictions:\nLifting of weights limited to 10 kilograms; No repetitive bending or twisting, especially against resistance; No strenuous pulling or pushing; Limited low level work; Opportunity to change positions as required.\n[5] Pursuant to an arrangement with the Workers' Compensation Board, CN paid the pension directly to Mr. O'Connor.\n[6] From 1990 to 1995, Mr. O'Connor was provided with upgrading and retraining at Cambrian College through WSIB's Vocational Rehabilitation Services. As a result of his retraining, Mr. O'Connor found employment, for a short time as an assistant in an addiction\/detoxification centre. According to Mr. O'Connor, however, he was unable to find full-time work in this area that was less physically demanding than the duties of his position with CN.\n[7] In July, 1997, Mr. O'Connor was told by his family physician that he was fit to return to work at CN without restrictions. Armed with a medical card attesting to his fitness, Mr. O'Connor requested that CN put him back to work. A Functional Analysis Evaluation completed in August, 1998, confirmed that there were no physical restrictions preventing Mr. O'Connor from returning to his previous position of track maintenance\/foreman on a full-time, full duty basis.\n[8] This is where a wrinkle appears in the case. At the time of his request, CN was still paying Mr. O'Connor a permanent partial disability pension (PPD pension) based upon WSIB's determination that he had permanent work restrictions. Apparently, as a result of a WSIB policy, these restrictions and the requirement that CN pay Mr. O'Connor a PPD pension could not be lifted under any circumstances.\n[9] In February 2000, CN's physician refused to recommend Mr. O'Connor's reinstatement for two reasons. Firstly, he expressed concern that a full return to work was incompatible with the permanent WSIB restrictions for which Mr. O'Connor continued to receive a pension. Secondly, CN's physician was concerned about the impact of the pain medication that Mr. O'Connor was taking on his ability to perform his work safely.\n[10] Based on the opinion of CN's company physician, CN refused to reinstate Mr. O'Connor into service. However, he was subsequently offered several positions which were deemed to be consistent with his WSIB restrictions. Mr. O'Connor did not accept these offers.\n[11] In September 2000, Mr. O'Connor filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that, in failing to reinstate him in his former position and to accommodate his disability, CN had discriminated against him.\n[12] Prior to the filing of his human rights complaint, Mr. O'Connor's union had filed a grievance against CN, citing CN's failure to accommodate Mr. O'Connor's disability and violations of the collective agreement. That grievance was heard on January 13, 2004 by Mr. Michel Picher of the Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration.\n[13] Mr. Picher subsequently rendered a decision in which he dismissed the grievance, stating that CN was justified in limiting the positions for which Mr. O'Connor was eligible to those that fit his WSIB restrictions. He also held that CN had discharged its duty to accommodate Mr. O'Connor.\n[14] On October 4, 2004 the Canadian Human Rights Commission referred Mr. O'Connor's complaint to the Tribunal. After some preliminary disclosure and exchange of documentation had taken place between the parties, CN brought a motion to have the complaint dismissed on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process.\nII. ISSUE [15] The sole issue to be determined in this motion is whether the complaint should be dismissed on the basis of the doctrines of res judicata or abuse of process.\n[16] For the reasons that follow, I find that both doctrines apply in the instant case. Moreover, I find that, in the circumstances of the case, there is no reason to exercise my discretion to refuse to apply the doctrines. Therefore, Mr. O'Connor's complaint against CN is dismissed.\nIII. ANALYSIS A. The Tribunal's Jurisdiction to Deal with the Motion [17] The Canadian Human Rights Commission argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to entertain CN's motion since the Commission has effectively ruled on this issue. CN's arguments regarding the doctrines of res judicata and abuse of process were squarely before the Commission when it decided to refer the complaint to the Tribunal. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot rule on the motion without sitting in review of the Commission's decision, a function which is within the exclusive purview of the Federal Court.\n[18] I disagree with the Commission's arguments in this regard. In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp. 2004 FC 81 at para.10 (Cremasco), the Federal Court (Trial Division) held that when the Tribunal rules on a res judicata motion, this does not constitute a review of the Commission's decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal. The issue on a res judicata motion is whether it would be an abuse of the Tribunal's process to rehear a matter that has been determined in another forum. That is quite a different matter from a motion asking the Tribunal to consider whether it was an abuse of the Commission's process to have referred a complaint that is, for example, out of time (International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Marine Section), Local 400 v. Oster, [2002] 2 F.C. 430 (T.D.)).\n[19] It is true that in the Cremasco case, the Court found that the question of abuse of process was not squarely before the Commission when it decided to refer the matter to the Tribunal. In my view, however, the Court's decision did not hinge on this issue. Rather, the key to the Court's decision in Cremasco is that the Tribunal, as master of its own process, has an obligation to ensure that its processes are not abused. If the circumstances of the case are such that it would be an abuse of process or contrary to the interests of justice for the case to be heard by the Tribunal, then the Tribunal may refuse to hear the case even if the Commission has referred it to the Tribunal.\nB. The Doctrine of Res Judicata [20] The doctrine of res judicata has two common rationales. The first is the need for finality. The second is that a party should not be vexed twice by the same cause (Cremasco v. Canada Post Corporation 2002\/09\/30 - Ruling No. 1, at para. 50, aff'd 2004 FCA 363).\n[21] As the Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly stated, the prompt, final and binding resolution of workplace disputes is of fundamental importance, both to the parties and to society as a whole (Parry Sound (District) Social Services Administration Board v. O.P.S.E.U., Local 324 2003 SCC 42, at para. 50).\n[22] However, there has also been some reluctance to apply the doctrine of issue estoppel to the determination of human rights complaints by tribunals such as this one. One of the primary concerns is that the dismissal of a complaint deprives the parties of the opportunity to have the merits of the case determined by a tribunal that specializes in the adjudication of human rights disputes (see, for example: Gohm v. Domtar Inc. (No. 1) (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/5968 at para. 43199 (Ont. Bd. Inq.); and Withler v. Canada (Attorney General) 2002 BCSC 820 at para. 42). Therefore, many have urged that caution and restraint be used in the application of the doctrine of res judicata to the adjudication of human rights complaints (Cremasco, supra, at para. 83, and Buffet v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) 2005 CHRT 16 at para. 40).\n[23] On two points, however, there is a clear consensus: the application of the doctrine is to be determined on a case-by-case basis, paying close attention to the particular facts of the case; and adjudicators have the discretion to refuse to apply the doctrine if doing so would work an injustice.\nC. The Two Branches of Res Judicata [24] There are two principal branches of the doctrine of res judicata. The first branch is known as issue estoppel. Issue estoppel applies where there are common issues in the two proceedings. The issues in question in the second proceeding must have been necessary to the decision in the first proceeding. Depending on the nature of the issue in respect of which the estoppel is being raised, issue estoppel may bar relitigation of only a discrete issue or it may bar the second action in its entirety (Hough v. Brunswick Centres Inc., (1997) 9 C.P.C. (4th) 111 (Ont. Gen. Div.) at paras. 24 and 25).\n[25] The second branch of res judicata is known as cause of action estoppel. In the present case, the parties have not argued that cause of action estoppel applies. Therefore, I will confine my analysis to the application of issue estoppel.\nD. Issue Estoppel: The Test [26] The two-part test for the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel is now well-known: (1) the criteria for issue estoppel must be met; and (2) if the criteria are met, the Tribunal must determine, based on certain discretionary factors, whether it is appropriate, in the circumstances, to apply the doctrine (Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc. [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460 at para. 33).\n[27] The criteria to be met for the application of issue estoppel are as follows:\nthe same questions are being decided in both proceedings; the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel is a final decision; and the parties, or their privies, are the same.\n(i) Same Questions in Both Proceedings [28] For this requirement to be met, the determination of the issue in the first litigation must have been necessary to the result (Minott v. O'Shanter Development Co. (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.) at para. 23). In other words, issue estoppel covers fundamental issues determined in the first proceeding, issues that were essential to the decision.\n[29] Mr. O'Connor argues that the arbitrator's decision was limited to the question of whether he was entitled to exercise his seniority to return to his original position at full wages. In Mr. O'Connor's view, the arbitrator did not deal with the central issue in his human rights complaint which is the following: Was the condition imposed by CN that Mr. O'Connor must be assigned to occupations within the WSIB restrictions a bona fide occupational requirement as contemplated by the Canadian Human Rights Act? Mr. O'Connor also argues that the arbitrator's conclusion with respect to the accommodation issue was not essential to his final decision and, therefore, cannot be subject to issue estoppel.\n[30] In my view, while the arbitrator may not have characterized the issues in the same way as Mr. O'Connor has done in this motion and he may not have used the same terminology that the Tribunal would use in analyzing the complaint, the arbitrator dealt with substantially the same issues that would arise during an inquiry by the Tribunal. As the Ontario Court of Appeal stated in Rasanen v. Rosemount Instruments Ltd. (1994), 112 D.L.R. (4th) 683 at p. 703, a different characterization of the issues and process for analyzing them does not necessarily mean different questions. (See also: Barter v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia 2003 BCHRT 9 at para. 45).\n[31] There were two principal issues that were raised during the arbitration proceedings: (1) whether Mr. O'Connor had been prevented from exercising his seniority rights under the Collective Agreement; and, (2) whether CN had failed to meet its legal duty under the Canadian Human Rights Act to accommodate Mr. O'Connor.\n[32] In his complaint, Mr. O'Connor states that CN discriminated against him on the basis of his disability by denying him the opportunity to return to his original position and by failing to accommodate him. Thus, with the exception of the reference to the collective agreement, the issues in both proceedings are framed in similar terms.\n[33] Were the specific issues that the arbitrator dealt with in arriving at his conclusion sufficiently similar to those that would be dealt with by the Tribunal to meet this part of the test? To answer that question, it is helpful to set out the issues that the Tribunal would consider in analyzing the complaint and then compare them to the issues addressed in the arbitrator's reasons.\n[34] In a hearing before this Tribunal, the onus would first fall upon Mr. O'Connor to establish a prima facie case that he was treated adversely by CN and that his disability, or perceived disability, was a factor in the adverse treatment. The burden would then shift to CN to lead credible evidence of a non-discriminatory explanation for its conduct. In that regard, one of the defenses that would be open to CN would be to prove that its actions were based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). To do this CN would be required to establish that:\nCN adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; CN adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate and work-related purpose; and, the standard was reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose in that it was impossible to accommodate employees sharing Mr. O'Connor's characteristics without imposing undue hardship on CN (B.C. (P.S.E.R.C.) v. B.C.G.S.E.U. [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin).\n[35] Section 15(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act provides that, in assessing undue hardship, the Tribunal will consider the health, safety and cost factors involved in the accommodation measures.\n[36] The Tribunal will also examine the extent to which the complainant cooperated with the employer's efforts to accommodate his disability. Generally speaking, employees are obligated to accept reasonable accommodation offers. Moreover, the employer's duty is discharged if a proposal that would be reasonable in all the circumstances is turned down (Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970 at para. 44).\n[37] Let us now look at how the arbitrator's decision jives with this analysis. The arbitrator began his reasons by acknowledging that there was a conflict between the medical evidence pointing to Mr. O'Connor's fitness to work without restrictions and the seemingly immutable WSIB restrictions. Thus, I think that the arbitrator tacitly acknowledged that either Mr. O'Connor was not disabled, but was being treated by CN as though he was disabled, or he was disabled and was being denied the right to return to his original position on that basis. I think it is clear from the arbitrator's reasons that he recognized that under either circumstance, CN had to justify its requirement that Mr. O'Connor be free from WSIB restrictions.\n[38] To that end, the arbitrator looked at the implications of refusing to accept the WSIB restrictions and simply placing Mr. O'Connor in his original position. He noted that if CN did this, it would still be required, in accordance with the WSIB award, to pay him his 20% PPD pension in addition to his full wages. The arbitrator noted, at one point in his decision, that CN had already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Mr. O'Connor in rehabilitation, retraining and disability benefits. Thus, in my view, it is implicit in the arbritator's decision that if Mr. O'Connor was not disabled, the employer had provided a good reason as to why he could not be placed in his original position: CN was bound by the WSIB decision and therefore, would be required to accommodate his restrictions and pay the PPD pension. It was unreasonable to expect the employer to pay both full wages and a PPD pension.\n[39] The arbitrator also considered the implications of accommodating Mr. O'Connor in his original position if he was, in fact, disabled as per the WSIB award. He noted that CN had understandable concerns that Mr. O'Connor might re-injure himself if he was returned to his original position. CN would then face the resulting costs of compensation for the re-injury. Furthermore, there was the issue of whether Mr. O'Connor's use of narcotics for pain relief would interfere with his ability to perform the functions of his work safely. Thus, the arbitrator concluded that it was not possible for CN to return Mr. O'Connor to his original position.\n[40] Finally, the arbitrator then looked at whether CN had discharged its obligation to accommodate Mr. O'Connor within his WSIB restrictions. He held that this was plainly not a case where the Company had acted in bad faith or sought to shirk its obligation to accommodate Mr. O'Connor in suitable employment. He noted that Mr. O'Connor had been offered two positions which were compatible with his work restrictions. However, Mr. O'Connor declined these positions because they were outside of Capreol, Ontario where he was living. Therefore, he found that Mr. O'Connor had not discharged his obligation under the law to participate in the accommodation process.\n[41] In my view, while the arbitrator did not explicitly mention the Meiorin test, the elements of the analysis and the findings that relate to each step in that test are all there in his reasons. The first part of the analysis is whether the requirement that Mr. O'Connor be free from the WSIB restrictions was rationally connected and necessary to the performance of the job. The arbitrator's conclusions regarding the safety and health implications of not following the WSIB restrictions would seem to address these issues. That is, the arbitrator recognized that CN had legitimate concerns that if it ignored the restrictions, there was a risk of re-injury. Moreover, there was the issue of the impact of pain medication on the safe performance of the job.\n[42] The second part of the test deals with whether CN could accommodate Mr. O'Connor in spite of the fact that he did not meet the requirement of being restriction-free. The arbitrator's conclusions with regard to the cost implications as well as the health and safety issues involved in returning Mr. O'Connor to his original position speak to the issue of accommodation to the point of undue hardship. In my view, it is implicit in the arbitrator's reasons that he thought it would create undue hardship for CN to accommodate Mr. O'Connor in his original position if he was still subject to the WSIB restrictions. This is the same issue that the Tribunal would be called upon to determine.\n[43] Moreover, the arbitrator's analysis of CN's efforts to accommodate Mr. O'Connor in positions that were within his WSIB restrictions involved a review of the factors that the Tribunal would consider. These include the existence of work in Mr. O'Connor's home location, the extent of Mr. O'Connor's participation in the process and the total cost of the accommodation efforts. The arbitrator's conclusion that Mr. O'Connor had not fulfilled his obligation to accept an offer of reasonable accommodation falls squarely within the analysis that would be undertaken by this Tribunal. Finally, the arbitrator's conclusion that CN had not failed its obligation to accommodate Mr. O'Connor directly deals with an issue that would arise in the Tribunal's inquiry into the complaint.\n[44] Therefore, in my view, it cannot be said that the arbitrator missed any of the essential issues in the human rights analysis. Neither can it be said that the issue of CN's accommodation of Mr. O'Connor was peripheral to the arbitrator's decision. In my view, the arbitrator's conclusion with regard to accommodation was integral to his decision.\n[45] For these reasons, I find that the issues in the arbitration proceeding were the same as those that would be examined in a hearing before the Tribunal. Therefore, the first requirement of the issue estoppel test has been met.\n(ii) Final Judicial Decision [46] It appears well settled that, for the purposes of the second element of the issue estoppel test, arbitration decisions constitute judicial decisions (see for example: Scotia Realty Ltd. And Olympia & York SP Corporation and Campeau Corporation (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 414; Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 22 at para. 28, aff'd 2005 FCA 311). Moreover, the arbitrator's decision is not under appeal and is, therefore, final. Accordingly, this aspect of the test is met.\n(iii) The Parties, or Their Privies, are the Same [47] In this case, like Smith, J. v. Canadian National Railway 2005 CHRT 22, the parties in the arbitration proceedings are clearly not the same as the parties before this Tribunal. However, when the parties to the proceedings are not the same, this aspect of the test may still be met if one party was the privy of another in the previous proceedings.\n[48] In order to be a privy, there must be a sufficient degree of common interest between the party and the privy to make it fair to bind the party to the determinations made in the previous proceedings. (Danyluk, supra, at para. 60). Decisions about whether there is a sufficient degree of mutual or common interest to say that one party was the privy of another must be made on a case-by-case basis (Smith, J. v. Canadian National Railway, supra, at para. 28).\n[49] In Smith v. CN, I stated that it is not possible to say that in all cases the union and the complainant are privies. Each fact situation must be examined on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the union and the complainant have sufficiently similar interests in the resolution of the dispute to find that they are privies of one another.\n[50] Unlike the Smith case, I find nothing on the record to indicate that the union and Mr. O'Connor had divergent interests in the resolution of the grievance. There is no suggestion that Mr. O'Connor's opportunity to advance his own interests was in any way fettered by the union's handling of his grievance. Similarly, there is no indication that he was denied the opportunity to provide evidence or make arguments on his own behalf. Thus, for the purposes of this aspect of the test, I find that the union and Mr. O'Connor were privies of one another.\n[51] However, this does not end the analysis. The Commission's participation in the proceedings must also be examined. The Commission was not a party to the grievance proceedings, but maintains that although it will not be appearing or presenting evidence or argument during the Tribunal hearing, it remains a party to the Tribunal's proceedings. Although the Commission made submissions on the present motion, they were limited to the issue of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n[52] Can it be said that the Commission was privy to the arbitration proceedings? To do so would require that I find that the union and the Commission are privies. In my view, this cannot be done. The requisite community of interest is simply not there. The role of the union in the arbitration proceedings is to represent the interests of the grievor and the members of the bargaining unit. The Commission's role in Tribunal proceedings is to represent the public interest. It is perhaps arguable, in light of the Commission's decision not to participate in the Tribunal hearing, that in some notional sense it was privy to the arbitration proceedings. In my view, however, this is a stretch.\n[53] I think that the better approach to take is a purposive one. As this Tribunal stated in Toth v. Kitchener Aero Avionics 2005 CHRT 19 at para. 16, the purpose of determining whether the Commission is a party in the context of an issue estoppel motion is largely to ensure that a party is not deprived of an opportunity to address the issues in the case. Given the Commission's stated intention not to participate in the hearing, I do not see how it could later assert that it was deprived of an opportunity to address the issues in the case. Therefore, in the present case, I find that for the purpose of determining whether issue estoppel applies, the Commission is not a party to the Tribunal proceedings.\n[54] In view of my conclusion that the union and Mr. O'Connor are privies, it follows that the parties or their privies are the same as those in the arbitration proceedings.\n[55] As a result of this analysis, I find that all three criteria for the application of issue estoppel have been fulfilled. However, in situations like the present and the one in Cremasco, where it is more difficult to say with certainty that the requirement of identity of parties has been met, the Supreme Court of Canada has indicated that it is appropriate to look to the doctrine of abuse of process.\nE. Abuse of Process [56] CN argues that if the Tribunal finds that the conditions for the application of issue estoppel have not been met, it should find that it would be an abuse of process to permit Mr. O'Connor to relitigate issues that were conclusively determined by the arbitrator.\n[57] In Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79 [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77 at para. 37, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the doctrine of abuse of process is appropriately used to preclude relitigation in circumstances where the strict requirements of issue estoppel (typically the privity\/mutuality requirements) have not been met, but where allowing the litigation to proceed would nonetheless violate principles such as judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration of justice.\n[58] The Federal Court has upheld this Tribunal's power to examine whether the doctrine of abuse of process applies to the particular facts of a case (Cremasco, at para. 41). The test for this doctrine was succinctly stated by the Tribunal in Cremasco at para. 81. The Tribunal must ask itself: Would it be fair to proceed? In Cremasco, the Tribunal explained that the public perceives the human rights process as an integral part of the justice system. Therefore, if the reputation of the larger system is to be preserved, one must consider whether, in the view of reasonable and informed but ordinary people, it would be fair to proceed with the complaint.\n[59] There is no indication on the record that the circumstances in this case have changed or that fresh evidence is now available that is relevant to the issue of Mr. O'Connor's accommodation. Nor is there any suggestion that the grievance arbitration was tainted by fraud, dishonesty or unfairness of any kind.\n[60] Therefore, in my view, a reasonable and informed person with an intuitive grasp of fair play would say that Mr. O'Connor has had his day in court, to use the vernacular. As this Tribunal stated in Cremasco at para. 96, it would be wrong to have a hearing, with all its accompanying inconvenience and expense, when the matter has been conclusively determined by the arbitrator.\nF. The Discretionary Factors [61] I have concluded that the criteria for both issue estoppel and abuse of process have been met. There remains, however, the question of whether I ought to exercise my discretion to refuse to apply the doctrines in the circumstances of the case. The discretionary factors that apply to prevent the doctrine of issue estoppel from operating in an unjust or unfair way are equally available to prevent the doctrine of abuse of process from achieving a similar undesirable result (City of Toronto at para. 53).\n[62] The Tribunal's discretion must be exercised in accordance with the particular facts of each case. The list of factors which may be taken into account is open-ended. In all cases, the objective is to ensure that the operation of issue estoppel promotes the orderly administration of justice, but not at the cost of real injustice in the particular case (Danyluk, at para. 63).\n[63] The following factors should be considered in the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion:\nthe wording of the statute; the purpose of the legislation; the availability of an appeal; the safeguards available to the parties in the administrative procedure; the expertise of the decision-maker; the circumstances giving rise to prior administrative proceedings; potential injustice.\n[64] The Canada Labour Code, which sets out the legislative scheme for adjudicating disputes in federally regulated workplaces, provides for the expeditious resolution of disputes (Canada Labour Code R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2, s. 57). The Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration was established to ensure that this goal is met. In the present case, it appears that the arbitrator had access to a number of procedural safeguards, such as the power to summon witnesses, administer oaths, hear evidence, order production, hear oral and written arguments and make preliminary rulings. It also appears that Mr. O'Connor was fully supported by his union. Mr. O'Connor has not raised any concerns with respect to the fairness of the proceedings.\n[65] Moreover, there is no question that the arbitrator is highly experienced and knowledgeable in the area of labour relations and human rights in Canada. He is also very familiar with the particular circumstances of the CN work environment. Although the arbitrator's decision is subject to a privative clause in the Canada Labour Code, parties may still apply to the Federal Court for a review of the arbitrator's decision if they believe that serious errors have been made (Canada Labour Code, s. 58). This was not done in the present case.\n[66] In my view, the circumstances of the case do not give rise to any concerns about potential injustice. Mr. O'Connor was given a fair hearing before an experienced arbitrator. Although he has raised concerns with regard to the arbitrator's interpretation of the applicable workers' compensation legislation, I see no evidence of any serious error that would lead to a miscarriage of justice.\n[67] Finally, at the time of the arbitration hearing, Mr. O'Connor was in receipt of a disability pension. He sought to return to his original position, with the result that he would have received full wages plus the disability pension. He failed to achieve this result. CN, however, continued to offer Mr. O'Connor work that fit within his WSIB restrictions.\n[68] According to his Statement of Particulars, Mr. O'Connor is currently employed by CN as a Flagman in Mimico, Ontario. In addition, he continues to receive a disability pension. The option remains for him to bid for his original position if he is successful in having his restrictions lifted.\n[69] On the basis of all of these considerations, I find that there are no compelling reasons to exercise my discretion to refuse to apply either the doctrine of issue estoppel or abuse of process.\nIV. ORDER [70] For these reasons, CN's motion is granted. Mr. O'Connor's complaint against Canadian National Railway is hereby dismissed.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

REMEDY\nAPPENDIX A\nI. WHAT IS THE COMPLAINT ABOUT? [1] This complaint is about whether Peter Kouba, using the pseudonyms proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian, communicated hate messages over the Internet, contrary to s. 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[2] On June 8, 2004, Richard Warman filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) alleging that from October 7, 2003 until June 2004 and ongoing, Peter Kouba communicated material on two Internet sites - www.stormfront.org (stormfront.org) and www.westerncanadaforus.com - that exposed First Nations people, East Asians, Pakistanis, Roma (also known as Gypsies) and other non-white people, as well as gays and lesbians and people of the Muslim, Hindu and Jewish faiths to hatred or contempt.\n[3] The Respondent denied that he communicated the messages. He alleged that the impugned messages were passed off as his own. He also alleged that he was not the kind of person who would communicate material that would expose a person to hatred or contempt.\n[4] In addition to presenting evidence of the alleged hate messages, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) and the Complainant led evidence relating to the identity of the person who communicated the messages.\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I find that the material presented during the hearing into this complaint violates s. 13 of the Act. I also find that it was the Respondent, Peter Kouba, using the pseudonyms proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian who communicated the impugned material over the Internet.\nII. WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT GAVE RISE TO THE COMPLAINT? [6] The Complainant testified that since the late 1990's he has had an interest in human rights, particularly in connection with the distribution of hate messages by those ascribing to white supremacist and neo-Nazi beliefs. This interest has led him to monitor the Internet for material that he regards as hate propaganda.\n[7] In the course of monitoring the Internet in 2003, the Complainant came across material on a website at www.stormfront.org that appeared to have been communicated by an individual living in Edmonton, Alberta. This individual was using the pseudonym proud18.\n[8] The Complainant testified that stormfront.org is an international website, based in the United States. It provides forums, which are sites on the Internet where people from around the world can communicate on-line about issues relating to white supremacy and neo-Nazi ideology. There are forums within stormfront.org that are dedicated to specific countries. The material communicated by proud18 was found on the Canadian forum of stormfront.org.\n[9] Within a forum, there is a list of threads or topics of discussion. The list is organized in chronological order with the thread containing the most recent message, which is also known as a posting, at the top of the list. The Complainant testified that any member of the public could read the postings within a thread on the Canadian forum of stormfront.org.\n[10] The Complainant stated that in the summer and fall of 2003, he became concerned about the material that was being posted on the Canadian forum of stormfront.org by proud18 for a number of reasons. First, the kind of language that was being used by this individual in relation to Aboriginal Canadians, the Jewish community, homosexuals and other minority groups was extremely negative and threatening. The responses on the forum to proud18's postings were calling for the genocide of some groups, such as homosexuals and the mentally disabled. Furthermore, there were indications in proud18's postings that the author was part of a group, known as Western Canada For Us (WCFU) that was planning neo-Nazi and white supremacist actions and events in the Alberta region.\n[11] The Complainant testified that in February 2004, it became evident that WCFU was also developing a website. In March 2004, the Complainant found the WCFU website on the Internet for the first time. On a page in the forum section of that website, the Complainant viewed what he considered to be hate messages directed towards gay and lesbian people. This material was posted by someone using the pseudonym WhiteEuroCanadian, who was designated as a moderator. The Complainant believed that WhiteEuroCanadian was the same individual who went by the moniker proud18 on the stormfront.org website. He believed that this individual was the Respondent, Peter Kouba. The Complainant testified that postings on the WCFU Forum could be viewed by anyone regardless of whether the person was a member of Western Canada For Us.\n[12] The Complainant expressed his concerns about the messages on stormfront.org and the WCFU websites to the Edmonton Police Hate Crimes Unit and then, in June 2004, he filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\nIII. WHO APPEARED AT THE HEARING? [13] The Commission fully participated at the hearing into the complaint and was represented by counsel. The Complainant also participated but was not represented by legal counsel, although it should be noted that he is a lawyer by profession.\n[14] The Respondent did not attend the first day of the hearing. At the outset of the hearing, an Affidavit of Service was filed indicating that he had been personally served with a Notice of the case conference on June 9, 2006 to discuss the upcoming hearing, a Notice of Venue indicating the exact location and dates of the hearing and a Tribunal letter outlining the procedure for the hearing. On that basis, I was satisfied that the Respondent had been provided with ample notice of the inquiry into the complaint as required by s. 50 of the Act. The hearing then proceeded on the first day in the Respondent's absence.\n[15] On the second day of the hearing, the Respondent appeared. He was not represented by counsel or an agent. The Respondent cross-examined the Complainant and made submissions in closing argument. He chose however, not to testify or to call any evidence on his own behalf.\nIV. WHAT QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS CASE? [16] The following three questions must be addressed in this case:\nCan the Tribunal consider material that post-dates the filing of the complaint? Is the material likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? Did the Respondent, Peter Kouba, communicate the material?\nA. Question 1 - Can the Tribunal consider material that post-dates the filing of the complaint? [17] The Complainant testified that he viewed the material on the stormfront.org and WCFU websites between October 9, 2003 and March 30, 2006. Material that post-dated the filing of the complaint in June 2004 was submitted as evidence of the ongoing violation of s. 13 as alleged in the complaint form. The complaint form, therefore, provided notice to the Respondent that material that was communicated after the date of the complaint would be tendered as evidence.\n[18] Prior to the first day of the hearing, the Commission attempted to disclose the post-complaint material to the Respondent by electronic mail, but received notification that the Respondent's e-mail system was unable to receive the material. The material was subsequently mailed to him and he was provided with a copy of the material when he arrived at the hearing on the second day.\n[19] Although the Respondent denied having communicated the post-complaint material, he did not object to its production on the basis that he had been given insufficient notice of the material. Given therefore, that the evidence relates to the ongoing nature of the alleged violations of the Act, and the fact that the Respondent had notice through the complaint form and the disclosure of the material that additional material would be presented during the hearing, I find that it is appropriate for the Tribunal to consider the evidence that post-dates the filing of the complaint.\nB. Question 2 - Is the Material Likely to Expose Members of the Targeted Groups to Hatred or Contempt? [20] Section 13 of the Act makes it a discriminatory practice for a person to communicate by means of the Internet, material that is likely to expose someone to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that he or she is identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[21] Hatred has been defined as a feeling of deep ill-will, an emotion that allows for no redeeming qualities in the person to whom it is directed. Contempt suggests looking down upon or treating as inferior the object of one's feelings (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892 at paras. 60 - 61). Material is likely to expose members of the targeted group to hatred or contempt if it is more likely than not to leave members of the targeted group vulnerable to extreme ill-will, or if it creates the conditions in which hatred and contempt are likely to flourish (Citron v. Zundel, (No. 4) (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/274 at para. 134).\n[22] An analysis of the growing body of s. 13 jurisprudence reveals that there are a number of hallmarks of material that is more likely than not to expose members of the targeted group to hatred or contempt. It may be useful at this point to provide a list of these hallmarks along with some examples from the case law to illustrate each point. The list is by no means exhaustive. It may, however, provide a useful context for the legal determination at hand.\n[23] After each hallmark is presented, a description and analysis of the material in the present case that displays this hallmark is provided. It should be noted that a significant number of postings were entered into evidence during the hearing. Many were too lengthy to reproduce in the body of this decision. Therefore, I have provided descriptions and short excerpts of the postings made by proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian in my analysis. Further detail and content of the messages are provided in Appendix A of this Decision.\n(i) The Hallmarks of Hate Messages (a) The targeted group is portrayed as a powerful menace that is taking control of the major institutions in society and depriving others of their livelihoods, safety, freedom of speech and general well-being\n[24] The powerful menace theme is a common theme in cases where people of the Jewish faith have been the target of hate messages. For example, in Citron v. Zundel, supra, the messages expounded the theory that Jewish people operate a secret conspiracy designed to extort money and amass tremendous power and control on a global level. In that case, Jewish people were said to have duped the world into believing that the Nazi Holocaust took place in order to extort billions of dollars from countries in reparation. Jews were branded as liars, swindlers, racketeers and extortionists. The Tribunal found that such messages created the conditions in which hatred and contempt toward Jewish people would flourish since they encouraged people to think of Jews as a group of liars, cheats, criminals and thugs (Zundel, supra, at para. 140).\n[25] The portrayal of the targeted group as a powerful menace can also be seen in Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc. (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/453, where the impugned messages warned readers that homosexuals have an agenda. That agenda was to have pedophilia legalized (Schnell, supra, at para. 36). Again, the implication is that without realizing it, the Canadian public was being tricked into allowing their children to be victimized. The Tribunal found that this created the conditions for hatred and contempt to flourish.\nDoes the Material in the Present Case Bear the Powerful Menace Hallmark?\n[26] Proud18's postings on stormfront.org about Aboriginal Canadians bear the powerful menace hallmark. They accuse the members of this group of extorting billions of dollars from Canadian taxpayers and claiming title to land that was never theirs. They warn readers not to fall into a guilt trap that has been set by Aboriginal people. For example, in a posting dated October 7, 2003, within a thread entitled If you don't like injuns, Then don't read this, proud 18 states:\nNow if you like the dream of the cartoon native Indian then do not read any further. It will show you how primitive these savages truly are.\nInjun Phil Fontaine is demanding close to $2 billion more a year for 600 1st. nation [600? That's the count Ottawa gives. One thing that puzzles me about this number is that 150 years ago there wasn't close to even half those numbers], These injuns are breaking away from their tribes and forming new ones. They then get a min, of a hundred million and so on ... Why should we have to pay these new off-tribes?\nOn top of the close to $8 Billion a year they get already for as they say Spent on native programs to fulfil treaty and constitutional obligations.\nWhat efen obligation?\nWe have over the years given them hundreds of BILLIONS of dollars\/ prime land \/ royalties \/ tax free living \/ lifetime welfare on top of their reserve money.\nAnd yet they live like savages. Maybe there are a few clean ones out there ... MAYBE.\nAnd another on top of these injuns keep beaking off about how much more money they want.\nBillions of dollars down the drain. Hell give ten WHITE educated people a billion dollars and watch empires begin to form. And these injuns keep whinning about the high cost of LYSOL. (sic throughout)\n[27] In a posting dated November 23, 2003, proud18 alleges that the extortion of money from White Canadians by Aboriginal Canadians has resulted in the demise of the Canadian health care and education systems.\n[28] Similarly, proud18's messages about Jewish people mirror the powerful menace image that is portrayed in other hate message cases. Jewish people are said to control the media, the education system and our governments, thereby putting the non-Jewish population in grave danger. Jewish control over these institutions is alleged to be the reason that individual rights are being suppressed. For example, in a posting dated November 23, 2003, within a thread entitled What will it take to motivate us? proud18 writes:\nWe all have our storys of how crapy it is where we live. We have less and less rights. Hell we are a endangered species. Whites by popullation are the biggest minority in the world. Jews have taken over our education, our media, our governments, etc. (sic throughout)\n[29] Like other messages bearing this hallmark, proud18's messages about Aboriginal Canadians and Jewish people attempt to generate feelings of outrage at being robbed and duped by a sinister group of people. In this way, the messages bearing this hallmark create the conditions for hatred of members of these groups to flourish.\n(b) The messages use true stories, news reports, pictures and references from purportedly reputable sources to make negative generalizations about the targeted group.\n[30] Messages that make use of allegedly true stories, news reports, pictures and references to apparently reputable sources in an attempt to lend an air of objectivity and truthfulness to the extremely negative characterization of the targeted group have been found to be likely to expose members of the targeted group to hatred and contempt. They encourage readers to accept, without question, gross generalizations and stereotypes about the targeted group.\n[31] For example, in Warman v.Winnicki 2006 CHRT 20, the Respondent made use of graphic photographic images of burned and dismembered people of African origin to convey his message that when an African person comes to live in Canada, he or she will inevitably bring violence and death. The Tribunal found that this increased the likelihood that members of the African community would be exposed to hatred or contempt since the images evoked strong feelings of revulsion and disgust (Warman v. Winnicki, supra, at para. 90).\n[32] In that same case, the respondent quoted from online news reports about crimes and events involving members of the targeted groups. The Tribunal found that the use of newspaper articles as evidence supporting the respondent's statements lent a certain appearance of legitimacy to his messages. This, the Tribunal held, enhanced the persuasiveness of the messages and increased the likelihood that the messages would expose members of the targeted group to hatred and contempt (Warman v. Winnicki, supra, at para. 82).\nDoes the material in the present case bear the true story hallmark?\n[33] Proud18 attempts to use true stories and news reports to justify the unfounded and racist generalization that most crime in Canada is committed by Aboriginal people. For example, in a posting dated February 11, 2004, proud18 recounts an allegedly true story reported in the news about an Aboriginal man whose murder sentence was reduced on appeal. Proud18 concludes as follows: ... if you are a injun you can get away with murder just because one is a injun. No wonder they commit most of the crime in Canada. They have the courts on their side and they act like it. Canada needs saving ASAP.\n[34] In another posting on stormfront.org dated November 30, 2003, proud18 starts a thread entitled Indians sought in murder of 70 year old. The posting recounts an allegedly true news story about the murder of a 70 year old woman in her home. Proud18 states:\nPolice are on the lookout for two injuns [so what else is new] who were seen running down the alley from her home. Now the doctors are scared to tell the 90 year old mother that her daughter was killed because they fear that she will die due to a broken heart. They only had each other in this world. (sic throughout)\n[35] Proud18 draws the following conclusions:\nIt happened in Edmonton, I find that the Prarie injun is the killer\/rapist type more then Ontario. But when it boils down to it they are all savages. (sic throughout)\n[36] Proud18 also makes use of apparently true news stories to convey a negative message about Black people. For example, in a posting dated November 30, 2003 within a thread entitled 2 black serial rapists of white women, proud18 recounts a story that was allegedly reported in the news, stating: two bald nigs have been raping women in the Clearview part of town. This leads proud18 to ask: How come the feds can say that most serial killers are white males but you can't even make it pubic that in Canada over 50% of the rapes are committed by blacks?\n[37] In a posting dated January 4, 2004 on stormfront.org, proud18 describes a media report about the serious injury and deaths that allegedly occurred during a gang fight involving people of the Hindu faith. According to the posting, the media report states that a White woman was involved with the gang and was also killed. In another posting on stormfront.org dated May 2, 2004, proud18 comments on a report in the media that a person of the Hindu faith had allegedly transmitted HIV\/AIDS to three women. Proud18 uses these news items to make the point that if White women associate with people of the Hindu faith, they are race traitors and deserve to die.\n[38] The use of allegedly true stories to justify extremely negative conclusions about members of the targeted groups is a powerful means of exposing them to hatred because it may seem to some readers that the conclusions are justified in light of the evidence provided by the stories and reports. The stories are often anecdotal in nature and devoid of any contextual details or background that might lessen the impact or weaken the inferences that are sought to be drawn.\n[39] In numerous postings, proud18 encourages readers to join him in sharing their negative stories and experiences with Aboriginal people on the forum, so that any white nationalists who might be harbouring positive feelings toward Aboriginal people might be disabused of such feelings. It would appear, therefore, that the goal of such communications is to expose members of the targeted group to hatred or contempt.\n(c) The targeted group is portrayed as preying upon children, the aged, the vulnerable, etc.\n[40] In Schnell, supra, the messages stated that gay and lesbian people lure children into pedophilia and homosexuality. Similarly, in Payzant et al. v. McAleer and Canadian Liberty Net, 26 C.H.R.R. D\/271, Aff'd 26 C.H.R.R. D\/280 (F.C.T.D.), the messages were presented in such a way as to establish an association between pedophilia and homosexuality. This set the stage for a message calling for the execution of homosexuals. The Tribunal found that the association between pedophilia and homosexuality primed the recipient of the messages with disgust towards homosexuals, thereby rendering it more likely that message recipients would find the execution of homosexuals to be not such a bad idea, maybe (Payzant et al, supra, at para. 38).\n[41] In Warman v. Kyburz, 2003 CHRT 18, the messages graphically described the filming of the sexual torture and rape of children for the purpose of producing pornography, and then made the claim that although not all consumers of child pornography are Jewish people, Jews are disproportionately represented among them (Warman v. Kyburz, supra, at paras. 25 and 26). The Tribunal found that such messages could only serve to foster hatred against Jewish people.\nDoes the material in the present case bear the predator hallmark?\n[42] Some of the material in this case bears the predator hallmark. In a posting dated December 1, 2003, proud18 portrays Black men as cannibals and head-hunters who have sex with animals; when they cannot do this, they resort to raping white women. Ominously, proud18 declares at the end of this posting that this [Black man] is what is moving in next door to you.\n[43] WhiteEuroCanadian's material on the WCFU website regarding gay and lesbian people also bears the predator hallmark. In a posting on that website dated March 9, 2004, WhiteEuroCanadian declares that homosexual people are not human beings, they are sexual perverts in the [same] category as pedophiles, bestiality, S&M, etc. It is because of this alleged tendency to prey on children that WhiteEuroCanadian states that he is opposed to homosexual people being daycare workers, babysitters, teachers, bosses, etc.\n[44] Like the material in other hate message cases that bears this hallmark, the material in the present case that characterizes the targeted groups as sexual predators plays on the intense fear that people have that children, women and vulnerable people will fall victim to the criminal and violent sexual impulses of the targeted groups. This makes it highly likely that members of the targeted groups will be exposed to deep feelings of hatred.\n(d) The targeted group is blamed for the current problems in society and the world\n[45] In Warman v. Alexan Kulbashian et al, 2006 CHRT 11, some of the messages blamed Jewish and Muslim people for the death, on September 11, 2001, of thousands of white folk in the World Trade Center in New York. The messages encouraged racialists to engage in violent acts against members of these groups. The Tribunal found that by equating all Jewish and Muslim people with the terrorists responsible for the 9\/11 attacks, the messages unquestionably exposed these people to hatred, contempt and real physical danger, as they suggested that all members of those communities would be legitimate targets of indiscriminate retributory violence (Warman v. Kulbashian, supra, at para. 55). The messages were also designed to tap into and exploit pre-existing feelings of anger and fear that were felt in Canada after the attacks.\n[46] Some of the messages in Taylor and the Western Guard Party v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Attorney General of Canada (1979), T.D. 1\/79, linked the integration of non-White races into Canadian society to the decline in the quality of health care services. The Tribunal noted that the persuasive effect of these messages was generated by the fact that they linked the race problem to a particular problem in the country which might have been adversely affecting the recipients of the messages. Similarly, in that case, hatred or contempt toward Jewish people was fostered by attributing to them the blame for unemployment, inflation and the encroaching Third World War, three of what were seen as the most pressing problems in the world at the time.\nDoes the material in the present case bear the cause of society's problems hallmark?\n[47] In proud18's postings on stormfront.org, the assertion is made that if Aboriginal people were not draining the Canadian economy of 10's of billions of dollars, the health care and education systems in Canada would be better. Proud18's postings also blame Jewish people, through their alleged control over the education system, the media and government, for robbing Canadians of their fundamental right to free speech. Similarly, in a posting dated November 30, 2003 entitled Muslim women break our laws on stormfront.org, proud18 asserts that because Muslim women are permitted to cover their faces in public, they are able to commit anonymous acts of terrorism like throwing grenades. In that posting, proud18 deplores the Canadian government for allowing the threat of terrorism in disguise into Canada.\n[48] These messages provide readers with scapegoats for the world's problems by providing an outlet for strong negative emotions; they tap into these emotions and divert them towards the targeted groups. In this way they foster and legitimize hatred toward members of the targeted groups.\n(e) The targeted group is portrayed as dangerous or violent by nature\n[49] In Warman v. Winnicki, supra, the Respondent made use of graphic photographic images of burned and dismembered people of African origin to convey his message that when any African person comes to live in Canada, he or she will inevitably bring violence and death. The Tribunal found that this increased the likelihood that members of the African community would be exposed to hatred or contempt since the images evoked strong feelings of revulsion and disgust (Warman v. Winnicki, supra, at para. 90).\nDoes the material in the present case bear the dangerous or violent by nature hallmark?\n[50] All of the groups targeted by the material in the present case are characterized, in one way or another, as dangerous or violent by nature. Aboriginal people are said to commit the majority of crime in Canada, while Black men are said to be responsible for 50% of all rapes (the other 50% allegedly being the fault of Aboriginal men). Asian people are portrayed as murdering gang members, Muslim people are characterized as terrorists and Jewish people are said to be taking control of Canadian society. On that basis, taking action against these groups is justified by proud18. Similarly, WhiteEuroCanadian characterizes homosexual people as pedophiles and argues that others should not be subjected to sexual divients (sic) like homosexuals.\n(f) The messages convey the idea that members of the targeted group are devoid of any redeeming qualities and are innately evil\n[51] In Warman v. Kyburz, supra, at para. 34, one of the messages portrayed Zionist Jews as having no redeeming qualities whatsoever because: being frauds, criminals, war mongers, pedophiles, anti-life and full of hate is part of them ... It is their nature. They will not and cannot change. The Tribunal found that when read in context, these messages tell the reader that Jewish people are innately devious, treacherous, and murderous. Not only do they want to kidnap, corrupt, and kill white children, their ultimate goal is to take over the world. (Warman v. Kyburz, supra, at para. 48). The Tribunal found that such messages served to foster hatred against Jewish people.\nDoes the material in the present case bear the no redeeming qualities hallmark?\n[52] All of the messages in the present case bear this hallmark in that they characterize the targeted groups in resoundingly negative terms and do not suggest, in any way, that the members might possess any redeeming qualities.\n[53] Proud18's postings regarding Aboriginal Canadians are particularly pointed in this regard. In a posting dated November 18, 2003, within a thread entitled Native Robbery proud 18 states: Sooner or later those Indians all break the law, its in their DNA to be bad. In another posting, proud18 rhetorically asks those who like these savages for an example of ONE benefit they have and one lousy contribution to society. Proud18 responds to the question in the following way: Just one instance that a injun is good, ... I can hear a pin drop in the forest with this defining (sic) silence.\n[54] In yet another posting dated October 11, 2003 within the thread entitled If you don't like Injuns, then don't read this proud18 writes:\nSo all you wn who love the injuns, keep passing this thread because you would see that your so called proud native is nothing but a waste of time and a drain on the rest of the population. Hell give them a whole province and those lazy s***** would die out in less then two generations without our handouts. (sic throughout)\n[55] Proud18's postings about Roma state that Roma are a fithy group of Hindus. According to proud18, they are thieves, murderers, pimps and molesters who were exiled from the Czech Republic and sent to Canada on the promise of free health care and education.\n[56] The messages in this case foster the attitude that members of the targeted groups are so devoid of any redeeming characteristics that extreme hatred or contempt toward them is entirely justified. Furthermore, they convey the idea that is hopeless to expect civilized, law-abiding or productive behaviour from the targeted groups and they ridicule any reader who might harbour even a partially open mind towards members of the groups.\n(g) The messages communicate the idea that nothing but the banishment, segregation or eradication of this group of people will save others from the harm being done by this group\n[57] In Nealy v. Johnston, (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, the messages claimed that non-white immigrants were pre-human and that they were allowed entry into Canada by the Jewish conspiracy in order to perpetrate the legalized racial genocide against the White race. The messages stated that the only solution was the forced deportation of non-white immigrants, or at the very least their segregation from the White population. The Tribunal found that such messages encouraged violence as a proactive means of defense against any who were seen as the enemies of racial purity (Nealy v. Johnston, supra, at para. 45668).\nDoes the material in the present case bear the hallmark of calling for banishment, segregation or eradication of the targeted group?\n[58] In a posting on stormfront.org dated February 27, 2004, proud18 suggests that Aboriginal Canadians should be given a one-way ticket to Asia and a case of Lysol \/ glue and they wont (sic) know where they are going. Proud18 concludes as follows: Then we could regain our rightful place as the first white Euro people on this continent.\n[59] In another posting, proud18 asserts that Aboriginal people should not be restricted to reserves but should be confined to ZOO's. In yet another, proud18 states [t]hese savages don't learn anything, unless its being a savage beast that should not be put among civilized people.\n[60] Similarly, proud18's postings about Black people assert that they [Blacks] should still be in the jungle and not among civilized people.\n[61] Such messages convey the idea that Black and Aboriginal people are so loathsome that White Canadians cannot and should not associate with them. Such messages provide fertile ground for the growth of hatred and contempt.\n(h) The targeted group is de-humanized through comparisons to and associations with animals, vermin, excrement, and other noxious substances.\n[62] In Warman v.Winnicki, supra, Black people were described as sub-human beings devoid of any intelligence. They were also called cockroaches and stupid nigger-apes. The Tribunal held that these kinds of descriptions are de-humanizing, degrading and highly likely to expose Black people and other non-White or non-Caucasian people to hatred and contempt (Warman v.Winnicki, supra, at para. 80).\n[63] Similarly, in Warman v. Kyburz, supra, at para. 49, the Tribunal stated that the use of terms such as sub-human and vermin to describe Jewish people could most certainly lead some readers to view Jews as being inferior beings, causing them to hold Jewish people in contempt.\nDoes the material in the present case bear the sub-human hallmark?\n[64] Proud18's messages about Aboriginal Canadians characterize them as primitive savages, subhumans, who don't even have one I.Q. point between the whole lot of them and who are of more value as fertilizer than as living human beings. Non-white immigrants are described as non-white scum that crawl here from all the garbage infested countrys (sic) and non-white people in general are described as mud. Jewish people are called stinking jews and Roma are called a filthy group of Hindus called Gypsies who sullied the streets of Europe and are now doing the same in Canada.\n[65] WhiteEuroCanadian states that homosexual people are not human beings, they are sexual perverts.\n[66] Such descriptions may lead readers to associate members of the targeted groups with waste, sub-human life forms and depravity. By denying the humanity of the targeted group members, they create the conditions for contempt to flourish.\n(i) Highly inflammatory and derogatory language is used in the messages to create a tone of extreme hatred and contempt\n[67] The use of epithets such as nig or nigger, mud, hebe, paki and others has been found to contribute to the likelihood that a message will expose the targeted groups to hatred or contempt (Warman v. Winnicki, supra, at para. 80). In Warman v. Kulbashian, supra, at paras. 44 - 45, the Tribunal found that the use of the term nigger, with its inherent connotation of slavery, segregation and racism, in and of itself displayed hatred and contempt toward Black people.\n[68] The messages in Warman v. Winnicki, supra, were riddled with profanity and a hysterical tone of rage. For example, in one message the respondent wrote the following:\nNIGGERS AND EAST INDIANS ARE SHIT!!!! GET OUT OF OUR CIVILIZATION YOU FUCKING MUDS!!!!\n[69] The level of vitriol, vulgarity and incendiary language contributed to the Tribunal's finding that the messages in that case were likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt.\nDoes the language that is used in the present material create a tone of extreme hatred or contempt?\n[70] Proud18's postings are riddled with epithets such as nig-nog, nig, paki, injun, and savages. In one message, proud18 states that he called some Aboriginal people injuns in a restaurant and was told by them that this was offensive. Proud18's response was allegedly that as long as Ottawa was giving White Canadians' money to Aboriginal people, proud18 would continue to call them injuns.\n[71] The tone created by such language and messages is one of profound disdain and disregard for the self-worth of the members of the targeted groups. The term savages harks back to the colonial days of North America when Aboriginal people were viewed by most Europeans as primitive human beings at best. The use of this deeply insulting term in full knowledge of the offense that it gives demonstrates the extent of proud18's desire to expose Aboriginal people to hatred or contempt.\n(j) The messages trivialize or celebrate past persecution or tragedy involving members of the targeted group\n[72] In Warman v. Kulbashian, supra, the Respondents made riddles and jokes about the Holocaust. The Tribunal found these riddles and jokes made cruel light of the genocide of Jews in Nazi concentration camps. The effect was to dehumanize members of the targeted group and to set a tone of denigration that would allow hatred and contempt to flourish.\nDoes the material in the present case bear the hallmark of trivializing or celebrating past tragedy?\n[73] Proud18 denies or trivializes the tragedy of the Holocaust by calling it a hoax, a lie perpetrated by Jewish people to extort money from non-Jewish people. Proud18's postings about Asian people celebrate the death and serious injury that allegedly occurred during a gang fight involving people of the Hindu faith. The posting dated January 4, 2004, entitled 2 dead, 4 injured. Yipee, describes the deaths and injuries of people of the Hindu faith as a joyful result. In another posting, proud18 comments on a report in the media that a person of the Hindu faith allegedly transmitted HIV\/AIDS to three women. Proud18's response to this news was: Serves the women right, screwing a hindu. Hope they get it and fast.\n[74] With respect to Aboriginal Canadians, proud18 writes: Personally I'm getting a bit tired every time I read about a injun tribe beating a white kid to death because they lost their land to our forefathers.\n[75] The trivialization and celebration of past tragedy in proud18's postings creates a climate of derision and contempt which makes it likely that members of the targeted groups will be exposed to these emotions.\n(k) Calls to take violent action against the targeted group\n[76] In Taylor , supra, at page 38, the Tribunal noted that the impugned messages contained aggressive overtones that escalated in their call for violence against members of Canadian minority groups. These calls for violence were premised on the previous messages that attempted to convince the recipients that White Canadians were under attack by these groups and had to fight back or risk becoming victims of racial genocide.\n[77] In Warman v. Winnicki, supra, at para. 101, the Tribunal held that calls for violent action against the targeted groups were not only likely to expose members of the groups to hatred and contempt, but worse, they sought to justify, motivate and legitimize violent action against members of the targeted groups.\nDo the messages in the present case bear the call for action hallmark of hate messages?\n[78] The messages communicated by proud18 ask readers on stormfront.org to communicate their negative experiences with Aboriginal people. The goal is to persuade readers not to harbour any sympathy for these red devils and to take action. Although proud18 does not specify what is meant by taking action, the following posting suggests that it might not be peaceful:\nThe violence by these scum injuns on innocent white people is getting out of control. We must do something soon to prevent further attacks on our race.\n[79] The call for violent action is echoed again in another posting by proud18:\nThe non-whites who pop out kids just to get more welfare money are the ones who should be castrated ...\n[80] Proud18 poses the following questions to the stormfront.org readers in an apparent effort to motivate them to take action:\nWhat I would like to ask of those that still are not too sure of what they want to do or if the 14 words is for them. What event would it take to have you cross that line and become a true white patriot?\nIf a black raped your spouce or child?\nIf you got beat up and mugged by a tribe of Indians?\nWhat would it take? Or is common sence and good judgement good enough for you to see that your race needs all hands on deck?\nAnd also at this time i'd like to ask some of those that have all ready seen the truth and decided the white race is worth fighting for, to share your story's with us. If you feel comfortable. (sic throughout)\n[81] The call for action is, in fact, found throughout proud18's postings in statements such as YOU FINALLY HAVE TO GET UP AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM. I find that the messages in this case bearing the call to action hallmark are highly inflammatory and provocative. They are likely to expose members of the targeted group not only to hatred and contempt but also to the possibility of violent action. While the call for action in proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian's messages is not always explicitly a call for violent action, there is a clear inference to be drawn that some kind of confrontation, resistance or opposition is being called for. The imperative urgency of these messages suppresses judgment and open-mindedness. It demonizes the targeted groups, thereby making them vulnerable to hatred or contempt.\n(ii) The Tribunal's Conclusion Regarding the Messages\n[82] The hallmarks or attributes of hate messages are what distinguish them from legitimate speech that is not subject to sanction under s. 13 of the Act. All of these attributes involve an attack on the inherent self-worth and dignity of the members of the targeted group. To paraphrase the words of Justice Muldoon of the Federal Court, material that bears the hallmarks of a hate message disparages and ridicules other people just for drawing breath, for living (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Liberty Net, [1992] 3 F.C. 155, at para. 56).\n[83] The messages in the present case bear many of the hallmarks of hate messages. They make use of allegedly true stories to justify the portrayal of members of the targeted group as dangerous and violent sub-humans who are worthy of nothing but the highest degree of contempt and hatred. They use racist epithets and slurs to create a tone of profound denigration and disgust. The messages advocate the exile or segregation of members of the targeted groups and exhort readers to take action to stop the evil menace created by these people.\n[84] For these reasons, I conclude that the material that was presented during the inquiry into this matter from both the stormfront.org and the WCFU websites is likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. Therefore, the messages examined above shall hereinafter be referred to as the hate messages.\nC. Question 3 - Did the Respondent, Peter Kouba, communicate the hate messages? [85] The Complainant and the Commission asserted that uncontroverted evidence presented during the hearing established that the Respondent, Peter Kouba, communicated the hate messages presented in this inquiry. The evidence adduced by the Commission consisted of testimony from Sergeant Stephen Camp from the Edmonton Police Force, a Witness Statement Form that was authored and signed by the Respondent, and evidence provided by the Complainant, Richard Warman.\n(i) The Evidence of Sergeant Stephen Camp\n[86] Sergeant Stephen Camp testified that he was a member of the Edmonton Police Service Hate Crimes Unit in 2003, when he began to monitor the Canadian forum on stormfront.org, a site he described as one of the primary sites for the propagation of hate. He noticed that there appeared to be a number of participants in the forum from Edmonton and other parts of Alberta. As a result, he began to monitor the activities and discussions of these individuals more closely. Sergeant Camp was particularly struck by the frequency of the postings made by one individual using the pseudonym proud18, who claimed to be from Edmonton. Sergeant Camp testified that he was concerned about the extreme nature of the hatred that was being expressed by this individual toward minority and Aboriginal communities in Edmonton.\n[87] Sergeant Camp witnessed on-line collaboration between proud18 and other members of the Canadian forum of stormfront.org to form an Alberta-based organization called Western Canada for Us, that would organize white supremacist political actions in Edmonton. As a result, Sergeant Camp stated that the Edmonton Hate Crimes Unit became concerned that proud18 and other members of WCFU would initiate violent action against minority and Aboriginal communities in Alberta. For that reason, the Edmonton Police designated proud18, and a number of other individuals identified with WCFU, as subjects of interest. Intensive investigative efforts were then made to discover the identities of these individuals.\n[88] Sergeant Camp testified that a number of investigative techniques were used to determine proud18's identity. First, proud18's postings revealed that this individual lived in Edmonton, was organizing rallies in Edmonton and was discussing the establishment of a Whites-only community in Alberta that was to be called Whiteville. Surveillance was conducted on the rallies and meetings that proud18 had helped to organize. One such rally was held in February 2004, at the Sandman Inn in Edmonton. There, an individual who was identified as Peter Kouba spoke about Whiteville and the strategy that would be used to get Whiteville started. Sergeant Camp testified that Peter Kouba's statements during the rally were consistent with the statements that proud18 had made on the stormfront.org discussion forum.\n[89] Sergeant Camp testified that the Police conducted computerized checks on the Motor Vehicle Registry and utilized other information sources such as the CPIC system (Canadian Police Information Centre) to trace proud18's identity. Sergeant Camp testified that through the Motor Vehicle Registry, the Police were able to match a picture with the name Peter Kouba. They were also able to verify that Peter Kouba was one of the people attending the white supremacist rallies and meetings organized by proud18 and others on the Canadian forum of stormfront.org.\n[90] Sergeant Camp testified that he continued to monitor the stormfront.org website on a daily basis to determine whether proud18 was, in fact, Peter Kouba. Sergeant Camp further testified that in the course of monitoring the Internet, he learned that proud18 and another individual using the pseudonym SS-88, were collaborating in the development of a website for WCFU. Police investigations revealed that SS-88 had assumed leadership of the WCFU as well as the principal development of the website. The investigation also led the Edmonton Police to strongly suspect that SS-88 was an individual by the name of Glenn Bahr.\n[91] In early March 2004, Sergeant Camp observed the WCFU website on the Internet for the first time. One of the moderators of the WCFU Forum was an individual using the pseudonym WhiteEuroCanadian.\n[92] He stated that within two weeks of monitoring the postings on stormfront.org and the WCFU website, it was obvious to him that a rift had developed between proud18 and other members of WCFU regarding the public image of the WCFU website. Sergeant Camp testified that he read postings on stormfront.org in which there was open disagreement between proud18 and other members of the forum about the use of neo-Nazi slogans and jargon on the WCFU website. Contrary to the views of SS-88 and other members of the forum, proud18 believed that the open espousal of neo-Nazi values on the WCFU website would turn the average person away from the cause of white nationalism.\n[93] Toward the middle of March 2004, proud 18's postings revealed that proud18 had been kicked off the WCFU website because he did not espouse the neo-Nazi values held by SS-88 and other members of the WCFU.\n[94] Sergeant Camp testified that he subsequently read a posting on the WCFU website by SS-88, the leader of the WCFU, that read: Due to differences between WCFU and WhiteEuroCanadian he is no longer here. Do not believe the lies that he is spreading. This led Sergeant Camp to believe that WhiteEuroCanadian and proud18 were the same individual and that they were the pseudonyms using by Peter Kouba.\n[95] Following up on these suspicions, Sergeant Camp decided to call Mr. Kouba on the telephone to ask him for a meeting in March 2004, to discuss the WCFU and Glenn Bahr. Sergeant Camp stated that the Edmonton Police were no longer interested in pursuing charges against Mr. Kouba since the Police had decided to concentrate their efforts on obtaining a conviction against Glenn Bahr, whom the Police believed to be the mastermind of the WCFU. Therefore, Sergeant Camp's purpose in meeting with Mr. Kouba was simply to obtain evidence from him against Glenn Bahr. Given the obvious rift that Sergeant Camp had observed develop between SS-88 and proud18 on the stormfront and WCFU websites, Sergeant Camp thought that it was likely that Peter Kouba, whom he believed to be proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian, would be willing to provide information about Glenn Bahr, whom he believed to be SS-88.\n[96] Sergeant Camp met with Peter Kouba on March 29, 2005. The conversation was wide-ranging and informal. Sergeant Camp stated that he confronted Mr. Kouba with the fact that, as proud18 on stormfront.org, he had said some very hateful and derogatory things about Jewish and Aboriginal people, as well as other minority groups. Sergeant Camp testified that Mr. Kouba responded by saying yes, but then adding that he made the postings not to promote hatred, but to promote white nationalism. Sergeant Camp stated that during the meeting, Mr. Kouba discussed his involvement in the stormfront.org forum as proud18.\n[97] During that same conversation of March 29, 2005, Sergeant Camp discussed Mr. Kouba's involvement as a moderator of the WCFU Forum using the pseudonym WhiteEuroCanadian. Sergeant Camp testified that Mr. Kouba did not deny that he went by the pseudonym WhiteEuroCanadian on the WCFU website. Moreover, Mr. Kouba elaborated on his theory of how the WCFU should be run and why white nationalists should not resort to neo-Nazi slogans and propaganda. He explained that he and Mr. Bahr had ideological differences regarding Mr. Bahr's beliefs in neo-Nazism and the fact that Mr. Kouba did not want white nationalism to be publicly associated with neo-Nazi ideals. He told Sergeant Camp that this was why WhiteEuroCanadian had been kicked out of the WCFU and off the website.\n[98] At the meeting on March 29, 2005, Peter Kouba drafted and signed a Witness Statement Form. This Statement, which was an account of the testimony that Mr. Kouba might give in a criminal trial against Glenn Bahr, was entered into evidence on the first day of the hearing into the present case. In this Statement, Peter Kouba wrote:\nA\/ I have no affiliation with Glenn Bahr or WCFU.\nb\/ When the WCFU came on line G.B. kicked me out and I was banned due to severe ideological differences. I was locked out of the WCFU site by G.B.\nc\/ I had no influence on the content's of the WCFU site. G.B. had total control of the site.\nd\/ I left and at the same time got kicked out of WCFU because G.B's Nazi idealogy and intent to make the WCFU site a hate site. (sic throughout)\n[99] At the hearing, the Respondent told the Tribunal that he was the author of this Witness Statement.\n(ii) The Evidence Presented by the Complainant and the Commission\n[100] Through the Complainant's testimony, the Commission tendered evidence consisting of copies of postings that were allegedly made by the Respondent, Peter Kouba, and other participants in the WCFU forum and stormfront.org Canadian forum. It was argued that the content of these postings was consistent with the statements made by the Respondent in his Witness Statement Form, and that they corroborated the testimony of Sergeant Camp that Peter Kouba, using the pseudonyms proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian, was the author of the hate messages in this complaint.\n[101] The postings are organized under the factual allegations that they are alleged to support. They are as follows:\nproud18 lives in Edmonton.\n[102] In a posting on stormfront.org dated October 19, 2003, proud18 states: I lived in cowtown for a few years but now live in Edmonchuck.\n[103] A posting dated November 24, 2003 on stormfront.org indicates that proud18's location is Edmonton.\n(b) proud18 worked with SS-88 to develop a website and an organization devoted to establishing Whiteville and supporting white nationalism.\n[104] In a posting on stormfront.org dated February 9, 2004, proud 18 states:\nWe have to come up with a $130 cnd. to build the Whiteville site and get it operational asap. ... I'm not going to beg for donations here [dont know if you can] but if anybody can help out in any way please contact me or SS-88. Thank you.

Get ahold of SS-88 to get the info on how to work on the site. thx\n(c) proud18 espouses a philosophy regarding white nationalism that is at odds with that of other members of the WCFU.\n[107] In a stormfront.org posting dated January 30, 2004, proud18 writes:\nI have even been told by a member here that whites cant be proud to be white UNLESS they accept at least some of the Nazi philosophy and beliefs. That comment alone is enough to drive away thousands of potential members.\nThere are many here that I know personally that have relatives\/friends\/spouces \/ co-workers etc. that are intiminated to join us here because they want to be able to be proud of their race, to help secure a bright future for our children, who are against immigration, who are against homs, to live among their own and help it's own communitys prosper etc.\nWe all agree [I hope] that we have many if not all these beliefs also. We also agree that we would welcome these white kin.\nSo why must we scare them off by giving them a big Seig Heil greeting? (sic throughout)\n(d) proud18 is expelled from the stormfront.org forum and WhiteEuroCanadian is expelled from WCFU by SS-88.\n[108] In a posting on Stormfront. org dated March 19, 2004, proud18 states:\nWell after working my ass off for over a year and a half on getting white folks to put aside their differences and work together I got SS-88 to move out here and help out.\nWell he helped out all right.\nBy backstabbing me and with a bunch of neo-nazi wannabees has staged a hostile takeover of wcfu and plans for Whiteville.\nI bleed for my race and this is how I got repaid.\nSo I'm out of wcfu since it lost its focus and has turned into a neo-nazi hang out.\n[109] On Friday, March 19, 2004, SS-88 posted the following message on the WCFU website within a thread entitled WhiteEuroCanadian is no longer here:\nDue to differences between WCFU and WhiteEuroCanadian he is no longer here.

Stop it! WCFU is a group! WE all have our input! I just took the initiative of getting it going. ...\n[114] The Complainant and the Commission asserted that the above-noted postings confirm that Peter Kouba was proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian.\n(iii) The Respondent's Explanation\n[115] In his Statement of Particulars and closing argument, the Respondent denied having communicated the hate messages on stormfront.org. He argued that his postings on stormfront.org had been subject to tampering. He stated that the Complainant had picked through the postings on the websites and presented only those that had been altered. The Complainant ignored the many posts where the Respondent asked why his postings and words were being changed by the website administrators.\n[116] In his Statement of Particulars, the Respondent stated that he would bring with him to the hearing copies of postings to prove his defense. The Respondent did not follow through on that promise. Furthermore, he did not testify or lead any evidence in support of his allegation that the impugned postings were altered, edited or tampered with in any way. As the Tribunal noted in Warman v. Kulbashian, supra, at para. 115, it is not sufficient for the Respondent to make out a defense of this nature by hints and innuendo during the course of the hearing. If he is alleging that he has been the victim of a set up, or that his messages have been tampered with, then it is incumbent upon Mr. Kouba to lead evidence in support of those allegations.\n[117] Mr. Kouba claimed that he had no way of proving that he did not communicate the messages, because his postings on both websites were removed after he was banned. Whether this was the case or not cannot be established since there was no evidence presented on the issue of the removal of the messages. However, there were other means by which Mr. Kouba could have provided evidence that he did not make the postings. For example, he could have testified under oath that he did not make the postings or explained how he learned of the tampering and what he did about it. He could also have called other members of the stormfront.org Canadian Forum or the WCFU to testify that they had observed that his postings had been changed. Mr. Kouba's claim that he was unable to defend himself against the complaint rings hollow in light of the options that were available to him.\n[118] The evidence of Sergeant Camp was that at no point during the conversation of March 29, 2005, did Mr. Kouba ever indicate that anyone had tampered with, edited or changed any of his postings on either the stormfront.org discussion forum or the WCFU website. Sergeant Camp further testified that the Edmonton Police's investigation of the members of the WCFU did not uncover any evidence that Mr. Kouba had complained to any of the WCFU members that his postings had been subject to tampering.\n[119] Based on the fact that the Respondent did not lead any evidence regarding the allegation that his postings on the stormfront.org website were tampered with, and the testimony provided by Sergeant Camp that the Respondent did not complain earlier about any kind of tampering, I find that this allegation has no substance.\n[120] The Respondent further argued, in his closing submissions, that there was no direct evidence that he was the communicator of the hate messages in this case. Direct evidence would involve testimony from a witness who actually saw the Respondent communicate the messages or a document that directly establishes that the Respondent communicated the messages. In cross-examination, the Complainant admitted that he did not have direct knowledge of whether the Respondent communicated the impugned material. The Complainant stated that his belief that this was the case was based on the circumstantial evidence that he had gathered over time.\n[121] It is not a requirement in law that facts in issue in a case be proved by direct evidence. In many cases, the facts may only be established through the proof of other facts (Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999), at p. 38). This is what is known as circumstantial evidence.\n[122] As has often been noted in human rights jurisprudence, discrimination is not a practice that one would expect to see displayed overtly (see for example: Morin v. Canada (Attorney General) 2005 CHRT 41 at para. 191). In fact, rarely are there cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is being practiced. The Tribunal therefore, is often required to consider all of the circumstances in determining if discrimination has occurred. An inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses.\n[123] As in many cases of discrimination, there is no direct evidence in this case that the Respondent communicated the hate messages. Therefore, in making a determination regarding the identity of proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian, the Tribunal must assess the circumstantial evidence that was presented.\n[124] During the hearing, the Respondent objected to the introduction of some of the evidence on the basis that it was irrelevant and was hearsay. He also argued, at the end of the hearing, that all of the evidence regarding the identity of the communicator of the hate messages was hearsay and should, therefore, be accorded very little weight. At the hearing, I ruled that the evidence regarding the Respondent's identity was relevant, and that section 50(3)(c) of the Act authorized the Tribunal to accept hearsay evidence. On that basis, the evidence was admitted.\n[125] The Tribunal is, however, mindful of the potential vulnerabilities of hearsay evidence. One such potential weakness is that the person who is said to have made the hearsay statements is not present at the hearing and therefore, his or her evidence cannot be tested. Another problem with hearsay evidence may be that its reliability and authenticity are not certain. The frailties of hearsay evidence may, however, be addressed by the weight that is accorded to it as the Tribunal makes its decision. The weight that is accorded to evidence also depends, to a large extent, upon its probative value, or the degree to which it tends to establish the facts in support of which it is presented.\n[126] Some of the hearsay evidence adduced by the Commission with regard to the Respondent's identity was not particularly reliable or probative and therefore, I have given it very little weight. For example, the Commission produced copies of postings on stormfront.org regarding the alleged participation of the Respondent in a radio call-in show. It was alleged that in one of these postings the Respondent, writing as proud18, responded to assertions by another member of the stormfront.org Forum that proud18 was Peter Kuda and that he had participated in the radio show. In the posting in question, proud18 admitted neither to being Peter Kuda nor to appearing on the radio station. Therefore, I find that the probative value of this evidence is weak, and I have accorded little weight to this evidence.\n[127] However, Sergeant Camp's testimony, the Witness Statement Form, and the postings on stormfront.org and the WCFU website presented in the previous section are highly probative and reliable. Hence, for the following reasons, I have accorded this evidence significant weight.\n[128] Sergeant Camp gave credible testimony about the basis for his conclusion that proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian were the pseudonyms used by the Respondent. I find Sergeant Camp's testimony with regard to the meeting of March 29, 2005, to be particularly salient. During the meeting, Sergeant Camp referred to proud18's postings on stormfront.org and WhiteEuroCanadian's postings on the WCFU website. Sergeant Camp's evidence was that Mr. Kouba did not deny having made those postings and indeed, attempted to justify them by saying that he made them not for the purpose of promoting hatred, but to promote white nationalism and white pride.\n[129] Mr. Kouba had the opportunity to challenge Sergeant Camps's evidence through cross-examination. He chose not to do so and in fact, was not in attendance on the day that Sergeant Camp testified. Moreover, he chose not to take the stand himself and provide his side of the story. Mr. Kouba can hardly then say, at the close of the hearing, that the truth of what Sergeant Camp reported about the meeting that took place on March 29, 2005 has not been tested and therefore, should not be given much weight. I find, therefore, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. Kouba made the statements as recounted by Sergeant Camp in his testimony.\n[130] During the hearing, the Respondent admitted that he authored the Witness Statement Form. Therefore, its authenticity is established. The Respondent argued, however, that the Witness Statement Form did not include an admission on his part that he was proud18 or WhiteEuroCanadian. I take the Respondent's point. However, the probative value of the Witness Statement Form lies in the fact that it establishes that Glenn Bahr expelled Peter Kouba from the WCFU because of ideological differences related to Bahr's espousal of neo-Nazi philosophy.\n[131] When the contents of the Witness Statement Form are compared to the postings made by proud18 on the stormfront.org website and by SS-88 on the WCFU website, to the statements made by Peter Kouba in his meeting with Sergeant Camp on March 27, 2005, a strong inference arises that Peter Kouba was the individual using the pseudonyms proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian to communicate the hate messages.\n[132] The postings indicate that proud18 lived in Edmonton and that he and SS-88 started a group by the name of Western Canada for Us. Shortly after WCFU mounted its website on the Internet, SS-88 expelled WhiteEuroCanadian from the WCFU website because of ideological differences. Proud18 complained about his expulsion from the WCFU website on the Stormfront discussion forum. This matches with the statements made by the respondent Peter Kouba in his Witness Statement Form.\n[133] Accordingly, I find that the postings that relate to the identity of proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian are corroborated by the Witness Statement Form. I have therefore, given them significant weight.\n[134] I have also accorded significant weight to the evidence of Sergeant Camp. He gave his testimony in a clear, convincing and forthright manner. Sergeant Camp's testimony was internally consistent as well as being consistent with the other evidence presented in this case.\n(iv) The Tribunal's Conclusion Regarding the Identity of the Communicator of the Hate Messages\n[135] The Canadian Human Rights Commission adduced credible evidence that supported its allegation that the Respondent, using the pseudonyms proud18 and WhiteEuroCanadian, communicated the hate messages over the Internet. The Respondent failed to provide an evidentiary defense to the case made out by the Commission. For the reasons stated above therefore, I find that the evidence in this case was sufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent, Peter Kouba communicated the hate messages in this case.\nV. REMEDY [136] Section 53(2) of the Act states that if the Tribunal finds that the complaint has been substantiated, the member may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice. Section 54(1) sets out the orders that may be made with respect to hate messages. It incorporates, by reference, certain orders that may be made under section 53 for other cases of discrimination.\n[137] The Commission and the Complainant have requested the following:\nan order that the Respondent cease the communication of messages like the ones that were the subject of the complaint; an order that the Respondent pay a penalty in the amount of $7,500.\n(1) An Order that the Respondent Cease the Discriminatory Practice\n[138] The Tribunal orders that the Respondent, Mr. Peter Kouba, cease the discriminatory practice of communicating over the Internet, material of the type that was found to violate s. 13(1) in the present case, or any other matter of a substantially similar content that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(2) Penalty\n[139] Section 54(1)(c) of the Act permits the Tribunal to order a respondent in a s. 13 complaint, where the complaint has been substantiated, to pay a penalty of up to $10,000. The Commission requested an Order that the Respondent be required to pay a penalty in the amount of $7,500 in this case.\n[140] In deciding whether to order the Respondent to pay a penalty in this case, Parliament has directed, under s. 54(1.1), that the Tribunal take the following factors into account:\nThe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice; The willfulness or intent of the person who engaged in the discriminatory practice; Any prior discriminatory practices that the person has engaged in; and The person's ability to pay the penalty.\n[141] I find that the numerous hate messages in this case that were communicated over a period of nearly three years were highly contemptuous and injurious. They portrayed members of the targeted groups as evil and criminal by nature. The especially troubling part about the Respondent's messages is not just that they were profoundly bigoted; they also willfully and intentionally exhorted readers to share their negative experiences with members of the targeted groups with other Forum readers. In so doing, the Respondent encouraged readers to participate in a campaign to convince the White world that members of the targeted groups are worthy of nothing but the highest degree of hatred and contempt. This active promotion of hatred and contempt towards members of the targeted groups is fundamentally at odds with the goal of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which is to promote a society in which all are free from discrimination and all are worthy of equal opportunity regardless of personal traits such as race, national or ethnic origin, colour, and sexual orientation.\n[142] There was, however, no information that the Respondent had engaged in any prior discriminatory practices.\n[143] Nevertheless, taking into account the nature, circumstances, gravity and intentional nature of the communication in the present case, the suggested penalty of $7,500 seems appropriate. The Respondent did not provide the Tribunal with any indication of his ability to pay the suggested penalty of $7,500. Therefore, in the absence of any such information from the Respondent, I find that there is no reason to reduce the penalty.\n[144] Taking all of these factors into account, I order the Respondent to pay a penalty in the amount of $7,500. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order, payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of the Respondent's being notified of this decision.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

How come the feds can say that most serial killers are white males but you cant even make it public that in Canada over 50% of the rapes are commited by blacks? Maybe then white women would avoid blacks.

Or is common sence and good judgement good enough for you to see that your race needs all hands on deck?\nAnd also at this time i'd like to ask some of those that have all ready seen the truth and decided the white race is worth fighting for , to share your story's with us. If you feel comfortable.\n(c) Posting date: November 30, 2003 Thread Title: 2 black serial rapists of white women Post #8\nIn response to a question asking what about the race of the victims of a number of alleged rapes, proud18 replies:\nAt least two were white. But it is now only 4 rapes, yesterday it was reported as 7 victims and possibly more of the ones that didn't report it. Serves the white women right for even talking to nig-nogs. But did you notice on the bottom of the story they put in a sentence about a teen getting raped by a White male in the city? That has nothing to do with the black serial rapists. But I guess the jew media had to point out that white males also commit rapes.

They took out ads saying the Government will pay for a one way ticket to Canada. I know they should of offered their homeland which is India. But the Gypsys left India so why go back and to what? This way they jumped at the chance for Canada. They talked about [in the ad] how in Canada they will get paid to stay at home and not work. Canada would give them FREE access to all health and education etc. Some of you may remember that. Soon after the Canadian government announced all Czech citizens must now apply for a visa [not the credit card]. They solved a lot of their problems. You know who they picked first? All the biggest theifs \/ murderes \/ molestors \/ pimps etc.\nPeople of the Muslim Faith\nThe following posting by proud18 regarding people of the Muslim faith was entered into evidence:\nThere is a law that prevents a person from wearing a mask. It is not enforced much but it is there. Muslim women wear their faces covered, is that not a crime then? You get 5 of them all masked and one throws a granede (sic).

Saturday in a nightclub in town there was a brawl between these two rival groups. The end and joyful result was 2 shot to death and 4 wounded. 2 of the 4 are in critical care. This is a great way to start the New Year. The dead include a white woman in her 20's that was with the Asian gang. Even though she was white I have no pity for this race traitor. She chose to be around them and now she died with them.

Jensen\n[1] The Canadian Human Rights Commission has requested that the Tribunal issue a subpoena duces tecum for Mr. John Beck in this matter. The Commission argues that Mr. Beck's evidence is required for the motion that will be presented at the outset of the hearing, to add him as a party.\n[2] Mr. Beck's agent, Mr. Paul Fromm, argues that it is inappropriate to order Mr. Beck to appear as a witness and to produce evidence that might establish his liability. In the event that the Tribunal rules that Mr. Beck should be added as a party, his right not to testify at the hearing would thereby be violated.\n[3] Section 5(1) of the Canada Evidence Act stipulates that no witness shall be excused from answering any question on the ground that the answer to the question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person. On the basis of this provision and comparable provisions in provincial legislation, it has been said that in general, all parties to civil proceedings are competent and compellable to give evidence at the instance of any of the other parties (Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999), at p. 704; see also: Ayotte v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) [1961] S.J. No. 111 (SKQB) ((Q.L.).\n[4] I find, therefore, that Mr. Beck is a compellable witness in the inquiry into the present complaint.\n[5] The Commission has requested that Mr. Beck bring with him all arguably relevant evidence relating to the websites www.bcwhitepride.com and www.bcwhitepride.org including: (1) all contract(s) with internet providers since 2004 to this day; (2) all emails he used to communicate on internet; (3) all information regarding body building competitions he was involved in as attested in the e-mails contained as exhibits as part of the already mentioned Motion to add parties to this complaint which was ruled upon to this day.\n[6] Mr. Fromm argues that the request for the above-noted documents is far too broad, amounts to a fishing expedition and includes irrelevant material such as the documentation concerning body building competitions.\n[7] Item one is sufficiently clear and not overly broad. The material is arguably relevant to the question of the identity of the communicator of the impugned messages. Therefore, if this material is in Mr. Beck's possession, he must bring it with him to the hearing.\n[8] Item two appears to cover all e-mail correspondence that Mr. Beck has ever had with anyone. This would be an overly broad request. However, when read in context, it would seem that what is requested is simply all e-mail correspondence associated with the aforementioned websites. Such material is arguably relevant. Mr. Beck must bring this material, if it is in his possession, with him to the hearing.\n[9] Item three allegedly relates to the identity of the communicator of the impugned messages and the individuals behind the Respondent website. In his Affidavit, sworn May 11, 2006, Mr. Shane Martinez deposed that Mr. Beck identified himself to Mr. Martinez as the co-founder of BC White Pride and the author of the material on the Respondent website. Mr. Martinez deposed that Mr. Beck also identified himself as a professional body builder.\n[10] The Commission has indicated that it will be calling Mr. Martinez to testify regarding the identity of the communicator of the messages and the issue of whether Mr. Beck should be added as a Respondent to the complaint. These are live issues in the present complaint. I find that material relating to Mr. Beck's involvement in the body building competitions referred to in the e-mails attached to Mr. Martinez's Affidavit is arguably relevant to these issues and therefore, Mr. Beck should bring this material with him to the hearing.\n[11] A subpoena duces tecum will be issued for Mr. Beck's attendance at the hearing into this matter.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

The Complaints [1] The complainant, Richard Warman, has filed a complaint alleging that in 2004, Glenn Bahr and Western Canada For Us (WCFU), communicated messages over the Internet that would likely expose Jews, First Nation Canadians, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, blacks, other non-whites and the mentally disabled to hatred and\/or contempt within the meaning of section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission fully participated at the hearing into the complaint and was represented by legal counsel. Mr. Warman and Mr. Bahr attended at the hearing and neither were represented by legal counsel, though it is noted that Mr. Warman is himself a lawyer. Mr. Bahr was represented by Mr. Paul Fromm. Mr. Fromm is not a lawyer. Mr. Bahr did not give evidence at the hearing.\n[3] The respondent, WCFU, did not appear at the hearing and was not represented by counsel. In an earlier written submission, Mr. Fromm alleged on behalf of WCFU that it was not a proper party to this complaint as it was neither a person nor a corporation. While this respondent did not appear at the hearing, I will deal with the substance of its position in these reasons.\nII. What Circumstances Gave Rise To The Complaints? [4] Mr. Warman alleged that in the early months of 2004 he became aware of a group called Western Canada For Us (WCFU). In March of 2004 WCFU established a webpage on the Internet. The complainant viewed the content of this website and believed that some of the content violated s. 13 of the CHRA. Mr. Warman alleged that he was able to determine that the Respondent, Glenn Bahr, was the leader of WCFU, and that this respondent was instrumental in first the creation and later the control of the website. Mr. Warman filed the present complaint in June of 2004.\nIII. What Questions Need To Be Addressed In This Case? [5] The following questions must be addressed in considering this complaint:\nA. What is the material that is alleged to violate s. 13 of the CHRA?\na.) The material available for download from the website:\nThe International Jew White Power The Turner Diaries\nb. Postings made to the discussion forum on the website\nThe Treaty Song posting The Homosexual posting #1 The Application posting The Homosexual posting #2\nB. Was the impugned material communicated in whole or in part by means of a telecommunications undertaking within the authority of Parliament?\nC. Was the material communicated repeatedly?\nD. Was this material likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason that such person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination?\nE. Did the Respondent, Glenn Bahr, communicate or cause to be communicated the impugned material?\nWas the person employing the monikers SS-88 and Glenn on the WCFU website Glenn Bahr? Did Glenn Bahr control the WCFU website? Did Glenn Bahr communicate, or cause to be communicated, the literature available for download on the website? Did Glenn Bahr communicate the two posts made by SS-88 on the WCFU website?\nF. Did the Respondent, WCFU, communicate, or cause to be communicated, the impugned material?\nPreliminary issue: Is WCFU a proper party to this complaint? Did WCFU communicate, or cause to be communicated, the literature available for download on the site? Did WCFU communicate, or cause to be communicated, the postings made on the discussion forum?\n[6] I find, for the reasons set out herein, that the material in question is of a quality that falls within the ambit of s. 13(1) of the CHRA. I find further that both Glenn Bahr and WCFU communicated the material or caused the material to be communicated as contemplated in that section. I find that the complaint is substantiated against both of the respondents.\nA. What is the material that is alleged to violate s. 13 of the CHRA? [7] Two snapshots of the WCFU website were introduced into evidence. The snapshots were copies of the entire website that had been downloaded onto computer discs. One snapshot was taken on March 31, 2004 and the other on May 7, 2004. The discs containing these snapshots were entered into evidence at the hearing. Most of the material alleged to fall within s. 13 of the CHRA was contained in these snapshots.\n[8] The homepage of the WCFU website contains a number of links that assist a viewer in navigating a site. When a link is selected by the viewer, he or she is quickly moved to the corresponding section of the website. Much of the impugned material was located in the Downloads section of the website.\n(i) The literature available for download from the website [9] The Downloads link lead to a menu of literature contained on the website. The material could be viewed on the website, printed, or downloaded by a person to their own computer. The complainant alleges that the following literature contained in this section of the website fell within the ambit of s. 13 of the CHRA.\n(a) The International Jew [10] The International Jew is a book written by Henry Ford and first published in the early 1920s. The thesis of this book is that Jewish people across the world are actively engaged in a global conspiracy to obtain control of the world\u2019s finances and the world\u2019s governments. The Jews are described in this book as being well on their way to global domination, controlling many industries in the United States and elsewhere, as well as controlling many of the world\u2019s governments, the entertainment industry and much of the world\u2019s news media.\n[11] This book describes how, by manipulating the industries they control, Jews create disruption aimed at weakening and ultimately destroying non-Jewish civilization, described as Christendom. Financial control is exercised to cause economic strife. The author states: the amount of our National debt is the measure of our enslavement to Jewish World Finance. Jewish control of liquor and tobacco industries allows the Jews to promote these commodities for the purpose of further weakening Christendom; control of the entertainment and other media is used to entice Christendom to debauchery and excess, thereby weakening its social and moral fabric.\n[12] According to the book\u2019s author, one of the strategies employed by the Jews to achieve their goal of world domination was to encourage the immigration of non-white persons into Christian society, and at the same time to promote the values of tolerance and liberalism. The Jews, the book states, use their control over the media to confuse citizens by extolling what the author describes as the poison of liberalism. Members of Christian society are tricked into embracing tolerance and liberal values and are made to feel guilt over racist thoughts or opinions. In the result these non-white immigrants, depicted as an inherently destructive force in Christian society, become empowered and entrenched.\n[13] Jewish people are described as unscrupulous, deceptive, dishonest and immoral. The author urges that Jews have engineered most of the world\u2019s ills, revel in them and rely on them as essential steps in their thirst for world domination. The solution to the Jewish problem is to eliminate Jews from Christian society.\n(b) White Power [14]White Power was written by George Lincoln Rockwell, the then leader of the American Nazi Party, and published in the mid-1960s. The thesis of this book is summarized in the following excerpt (page 88):\nThere you have the Jewish-Communist program in a nut shell - the USE of the backward, childish and savage Negro race to destroy the White Race, which stands between the Jews and their mad goal of domination from Israel. The Jews, comprising only a fraction of one percent of the world\u2019s people, are too few to produce their own mobs, and they are too un-fond of physical violence to provide any amount of their own muscle. They need vast numbers of peanut-brained, violent but robot-like troops. The Negro race is perfect for the needs of the Jews in fomenting their mutiny. But before the blacks can do the Jews and the Marxists any good, they must first be placed in position and conditioned.\n[15] This book, like the International Jew, discussed above, speaks of the Jewish program of encouraging tolerance and multiculturalism; a program designed to destroy the white race. The aim of this deception is to destroy the spirit of the elite White Race, filling members of the white race with guilt over any inclination toward racism. Non-white persons are assimilated into white society and empowered so that the Jews, . . . and their army of mongrels (will) overwhelm the White champion of civilization by sheer numbers.\n(c) The Turner Diaries [16]The Turner Diaries is a book written by William Luther Pierce, the leader of the National Alliance, a White Supremacist group with origins in the United States of America. This book, a work of fiction, presents the story of a white revolutionary named Earl Turner and his organization of white people, that wages a violent racial revolution in the United States in violent opposition to the Jews, and to what is described as the equality hoax perpetrated by the Jews. The struggle escalates to a global genocide, and leads to the extermination of all Jews, all non-whites and those whites who associate or sympathize with Jews or non-whites. The violence depicted in this work is horrific. Jews, described as Satan\u2019s spawn, are shot, stabbed, burned alive and hanged singly and in groups, as are other non-whites and race criminals - those who support or associate with non-white persons or groups.\n(ii) Postings made to the discussion forum on the website [17] The WCFU website contained a discussion forum that allowed individuals to post material on the site. The forum was organized into different topic threads, and people were invited to contribute comment or material to the threads. The complainant, Richard Warman, testified that while one had to be a registered member to contribute, membership could be obtained quickly and easily on the website by providing minimal information. The postings to the forums contained numerous typographical errors. What follows are verbatim transcriptions of the impugned postings with no editing for spelling or grammar.\n[18] The Complainant identified two postings alleged to come within s. 13 and alleged to have been made by the Respondent, Glenn Bahr.\n(a) The Treaty Song Posting [19] On March 18, 2004, SS-88, a pseudonym the complainant and the Commission allege to have been used by the respondent, Glenn Bahr, made a posting to the WCFU site titled The Treaty Song. This posting was not contained in either of the two snapshots of the website filed in evidence. This Tribunal heard evidence that the posting was discovered on the WCFU website on or about March 18, 2004, and downloaded. The posting, a copy of which was filed as an exhibit in the hearing, read in part as follows:\nWell I wish I had my treaty card in this land of equality, I wouldn\u2019t have to work I could party all night and sleep till after three. I\u2019d get a big fat squaw that could pop out kids at the rate of two a year. I\u2019d get a pretty good welfare cheque, play the VLTs and I\u2019d never run out of beer.\n. . .\nWell I wish I had a treaty card in this land of equality, cause if my house burned down or I just smashed it up, well I wouldn\u2019t frown I\u2019d get another one from whitey for free. I wouldn\u2019t have to work or go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have to pay not tax. I\u2019d just hold out my hand and say you stole my land and I\u2019d be riding on the gravy train!\nI sure wish I had a Treaty card.\n(b) Homosexual posting #1 [20] On March 10, 2004, SS-88 made a posting to a discussion thread on the WCFU website titled, Homosexuals. This posting was included in one of the two snapshots of the website filed as evidence in the hearing and read in part as follows:\nI believe no matter how or why you are a homosexual your life should be terminated. . . They should be terminated along with retards and any other degenerates that nature would do away with in the wild. What gives us the right to prolong a life that would have been terminated by nature.\n(c) The Application post [21] The complainant alleges that certain postings alleged to have been made by persons other than the respondent, Glenn Bahr to the WCFU discussion forum also fall within s. 13. The first was posted by a person using the pseudonym, TowerDB. This posting was not included in either of the webpage snapshots. The Tribunal heard evidence that the posting was discovered on the WCFU website on or about March 18, 2004 and downloaded. A copy of the posting was entered as an exhibit during the hearing and reads in part as follows:\nAPPLICATION TO BE A INDIAN\nDepartment of Indain & Unimportant Affairs\n. . .\nAddress (if living in automobile, give make, model and licence number)\nName of Mudder Name of Fudder\nAutomobile (Check One) __ Cadillac __ Buick __ Stationwagon\nIf Auto is financed, what is the repossession date?\nColor of car __ Blue __ Pink __ Multi __ Primer __ Other\nApproximate estimate of Income ____ Welfare ___ UIC ___ Theft ______ Beer bottles\nPlace of Birth __ Hospital __ Back Alley __ Ditch __ back of car\nTools or Machines you can opperate __ Crowbar __ Pinball __ Knife __ Bingo Dabber __ Match __ TV Remote __ Slot Machine __ Other\nCheck Illnesses you had the last year __ Vanilla Poisoning __ Alcohol Poisoning __Lung Burns (due to gasoline inhalation) __ Other\nNumber of Children __ 1St Wife __ 2nd Wife __ 3rd Wife __ Neighbor\u2019s Wife __ Shackups\n. . .\nHave you ever been arrested? __ Yes __ No If No, Explain.\nHow many refrigerators and junk cars are in your front yard: ____________\nOther than living for free and drinking all the taxpayers money away, what is your greatest goal in life besides nothing?\n(d) Homosexual posting #2 [22] A second posting was made by a person using the pseudonym WhiteEuroCanadian. This person contributed a posting to the discussion forum thread titled Homosexuals on March 9, 2004. The posting was included in the website snapshot and read in part as follows:\nThese are not human beings, they are sexual perverts in the same category as pedophiles, beastiality, S&M etc. Why in the world of descent morals must the majority of the population be subjected to sexual divients like homosexuals? It is a SEX thing. Why give them special status that normal Canadians enjoy? . . .\nB. Was the impugned material communicated in whole or in part by means of a telecommunications undertaking within the authority of Parliament? [23] S. 13 of the CHRA was amended in 2001 by the addition of s. 13(2), which reads as follows:\nFor greater certainty, subsection (1) applies in respect of a matter that is communicated by means of a computer or a group of interconnected computers, including the Internet, or any similar means of communication . . .\n[24] The amendment clarifies that section 13(1) applies to matters communicated by means of the Internet. I find that the impugned material communicated was communicated for the purposes of s. 13.\nC. Was the impugned material communicated repeatedly? [25] The CHRA requires in s. 13(1) that material be communicated repeatedly. Member Sinclair, in his decision in Schnell (supra) considered the meaning of this word for the purpose of the section. Member Sinclair found that the requirement of repetition in s. 13(1) suggests that the section is directed not at private communication, but rather at material intended for wider, public circulation (See also Warman v. Kyburz [2003], CHRT 18 at para.10).\n[26] While there was no evidence led about the number of persons who viewed each of the impugned communications, I note that the March 31, 2004 snapshot of the website indicates that on that date, a mere three weeks after the website had been established, the discussion forum had received 1,193 postings and the website identifies that 90 persons had registered as members on the site. The May 7, 2004 snapshot of the website indicates that membership had grown to 205 members, and that there had been 2,848 postings made to the website. Further, the material was available to the complainant and any person who accessed the website from their computer by means of the Internet. The website was not a private communication, but was intended for wider, public circulation. I find that the material on the website was communicated repeatedly.\nD. Was this material likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that such person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? [27] This Tribunal and the courts have canvassed thoroughly the proper interpretation of the words likely, expose, hatred and contempt.\n[28] S. 13(1) provides that to fall within the ambit of s. 13(1), material must be likely to expose a person to hatred or contempt. This means it is not necessary for a complainant to lead evidence that a person was actually moved to hatred or contempt by the communication of the material (Schnell, (supra) at para. 88, and see Nealy v. Johnston (supra), at para. 45657).\n[29] The word expose has also been considered by this Tribunal. In Nealy the Tribunal contrasted this word with the words of incite and promote, that are used in various sections of the Criminal Code (Nealy, supra, at para. 45657). Expose, the Tribunal found, is a more passive word than is incite or provoke and means leaving one unprotected, or to lay one open to danger, ridicule, or censure. Incite, on the other hand, has a more active connotation and means to stir up, while promote means to encourage or to support actively. It is clear that the legislature intended that s. 13(1) of the CHRA capture a wider range of expression than that contemplated in the Criminal Code. In another case, the Tribunal found that . . . if one is creating the right conditions for hatred to flourish, leaving the identifiable group open or vulnerable to ill-feelings or hostility, if one is putting them at risk of being hated . . . one then falls within the compass of s. 13(1). (Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Western Guard Party and John Ross Taylor, (July 20, 1979) (Can. Trib.; Leddy, Lederman and Volpini) [unreported], at page 29).\n[30] This Tribunal and the courts have also considered the proper interpretation of the words hatred and contempt. In a decision considering the constitutionality of s. 13(1), the Supreme Court of Canada observed a tension fundamental to the interpretation of the section. While human rights statutes, because of their nature as fundamental law, are to be accorded a generous and purposive interpretation, that purposive interpretation cannot extend so far as to permit the limitation of the freedom of expression guaranteed under s. 2(b), unless the limitation can be justified under s. 1 of the Charter (Taylor (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor [1990], 3 S.C.R. 892, at para. 59).\n[31] In upholding the constitutionality of the section, Dickson J. found that the objective of s. 13(1) of the CHRA is to protect the equality and dignity of all persons by reducing the incidence of harm causing expression. He found that an interpretation of the words hatred and contempt, if undertaken with a full understanding of this purpose, would be a reasonable limit on the freedom of expression. (Note: in Taylor, the Supreme Court of Canada was considering the constitutionality of s. 13(1) in the context of transmission of material by telephone. A more recent decision of this Tribunal found s. 13(1) to be a reasonable limit on the freedom of expression in respect of material communicated by means of the Internet. This decision relies heavily on Taylor, and repeats the definitions of hatred and contempt. (Citron v. Zundel, [2002], T.D. 1\/02.)\n[32] Dickson J. describes the profound harm visited on targets of messages of hatred. Referencing numerous studies on the effects of hate messages, Justice Dickson explains that hate propaganda can undermine the dignity and self-worth of target group members, and more generally contribute to disharmonious relations among various racial, cultural and religious groups, as a result eroding the tolerance and open-mindedness that must flourish in a multicultural society which is committed to the idea of equality. (Taylor, supra, at para. 41) The purpose of s. 13(1) is to prevent this harm.\n[33] The Supreme Court in Taylor adopts the interpretation of the words hatred and contempt that was provided by this tribunal in Nealy v. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450. The core meaning of hatred is described by that Tribunal as a set of emotions and feelings which involve extreme ill will toward another person or group of persons, an emotion that would admit no redeeming qualities for the individual or group. The core meaning of contempt is a set of emotions similarly extreme and which involve feelings of superiority over the individual or group, or that of feelings of the group\u2019s inferiority (Taylor, supra, at para. 60, Nealy, supra, at p. 928)\n[34] The terms hatred and contempt for the purpose of s. 13(1) refer to unusually strong and deep-felt emotions of detestation, calumny and vilification. (Taylor, supra, at para. 61).\n[35] Reviewing the impugned material, I find, for the following reasons, that each are likely to expose a person or group of persons, identifiable on a prohibited ground, to hatred or contempt as those words are interpreted in Nealy.\n[36] The International Jew posits a theory that the Jews are the engineers of the woes of the (non-Jewish) world and have a covert plan of global domination. Jews as a group are described as unscrupulous, deceptive, dishonest and immoral. The book advocates that the Jews must be removed from society. The thesis of this book and the description of the personal characteristics of Jewish persons is likely to evoke extreme ill will against Jewish persons.\n[37] The book White Power describes persons of African descent in the most contemptible of terms. Descriptors of backward, childish, savage, peanut-brained deny to this group of persons any redeeming qualities and express emotions of extreme ill will and vilification. Indeed, the words deny the very humanity of these persons (i.e. robot-like). The book also expresses extreme ill will against Jewish people, who are described as intent on destroying the white race.\n[38] The book, The Turner Diaries, describes in lurid fictional detail, the global genocide of Jews, other non-Whites, and those who would associate with them. This genocide is undertaken because of the equality hoax perpetrated by the Jews and designed, as described in the International Jew and White Power, to destroy the white race. While a fictional account, a reader cannot help but conclude that this book advocates for the genocide of these people on the basis of their membership in groups protected under the CHRA. The book constitutes a profound denial of the humanity of Jews and others. It expresses extreme ill will and denies any redeeming human quality to members of these groups.\n[39] I find that these three books made available for download on the WCFU website meet the test in Nealy. Each of them is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact of their membership in a group protected under s. 2 of the CHRA.\n[40] The posting, The Treaty Song suggests that aboriginal, or First Nation Canadians, are given licence to be, and are, non-contributing citizens. It goes further to suggest that these people do not work, are alcoholics, are on welfare, gamble excessively, destroy their own property, are sexually promiscuous and irresponsible. I find this posting is a sweeping and gross caricature of aboriginal Canadians. It is an expression of extreme ill will and of utter contempt.\n[41] The posting made by SS-88 to the discussion thread titled Homosexuals advocates for the termination of the very lives of homosexuals and retards. Advocating wholesale extermination of the members of these groups is a complete denial that members of these groups might have redeeming qualities and is an expression of extreme ill will.\n[42] The posting, Application to be a Indian, suggests that First Nations or aboriginal Canadians live in and are born in cars, that their sources of income are restricted to welfare, unemployment insurance, the proceeds of theft and bottle picking and that these persons are promiscuous, lazy, illiterate and violent. The portrayal of aboriginal Canadians in this posting is odious, evocative of extreme ill will and profound contempt.\n[43] The posting made by WhiteEuroCanadian to the discussion thread titled, Homosexuals denies that homosexuals are human beings. Such a denial, a rejection of the very humanity of persons belonging to this minority group, is an expression of extreme ill will, and is hatred and contempt for the purpose of s. 13(1).\n[44] The Respondent, Glenn Bahr, argued that the material identified in the complaint is a form of legitimate political expression and does not violate s. 13(1). I would paraphrase the observations of this Tribunal in Nealy and reply that the line between legitimate expression and illegitimate expression arises from the manner in which any political discourse is pursued. Whether or not material might be connected to a political or other opinion, and whether or not the material might arise from a deeply held belief of the communicator, the material will violate s. 13(1) where it exposes others to hatred or contempt on the basis of their membership in a group protected under the CHRA, and I find that the material considered in this decision does so.\nE. Did the Respondent, Glenn Bahr, communicate, or cause to be communicated, the impugned messages from the above noted sources by means of the Internet? [45] The complainant and the Commission allege that the respondent, Glenn Bahr, communicated some of the impugned material, or caused it to be communicated. The complainant and the Commission allege that this respondent communicated the literature contained in the Downloads part of the website and that he communicated the postings made by SS-88. It is alleged that Glenn Bahr, used the pseudonyms of SS-88 and Glenn on the WCFU website and further that he contributed the two postings made by SS-88. It is further alleged that Glenn Bahr, either alone or with others, controlled the WCFU website and therefore, either alone, or acting with others, communicated or caused to be communicated the impugned material contained in the Downloads section of the website.\n(i) Was the respondent, Glenn Bahr, the person posting messages on the WCFU website under the pseudonyms SS-88 and Glenn? [46] The complainant and the Commission allege that the person using the website user names or pseudonyms of SS-88 and Glenn on the WCFU website was the respondent, Glenn Bahr. I find for the following reasons that the person communicating the material under the pseudonyms SS-88 and Glenn was the respondent, Glenn Bahr.\n[47] Sergeant Steven Camp, of the Edmonton Police Service Hate Crimes Unit, testified at the hearing as a witness for the Commission. The Sergeant testified that he had conducted an investigation of the WCFU and Glenn Bahr during the time relevant to this complaint. It was the Sergeant who made the website snapshots discussed earlier and who downloaded the Application posting and the Treaty Song posting from the website. Sergeant Camp testified that as a result of his investigation of Mr. Bahr and the WCFU website, Glenn Bahr had been charged under section 319(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada, being the provision prohibiting the wilful promotion of hatred. At the time of the hearing of this complaint, there had not yet been a trial commenced in relation to the Criminal Code charge.\n[48] Sergeant Camp testified that as part of his work in the Hate Crimes Unit, he monitored Internet websites. Among the websites monitored by the Sergeant, were sites that in his opinion contained neo-Nazi and white nationalist content. The Sergeant testified that he monitored these sites looking for evidence of activity in Edmonton that might be of interest to the Unit. One such site is an American based website called stormfront.org. The Sergeant testified that this website has discussion forums designated for different countries, including Canada.\n[49] Sergeant Camp testified that he noticed, in the Canada forum, a series of discussions about the creation of a community in the Province of Alberta to be called Whiteville. One contributor to these discussions used the pseudonym SS-88. The Sergeant testified that in his experience, SS-88 is a common symbol in neo-Nazi culture. SS is a reference to the Schutztaffel Police force in Europe during the Nazi occupation, and 88 is a numerical code for HH, meaning Heil Hitler. The letter H is the 8th letter of the alphabet.\n[50] In February of 2004, SS-88 posted on stormfront.org, notice of a meeting of the WCFU that had been planned for Red Deer, Alberta. In that post, SS-88 advised that he had asked the Red Deer RCMP detachment to attend at the event to help keep the peace as there was a concern that members of the Anti-Racist Action Group (ARA) might attend the meeting and cause a disturbance. Sergeant Camp later confirmed with the Red Deer detachment that its officers had a discussion about this WCFU meeting in February of 2004 with a person identifying himself as Glenn Bahr.\n[51] Shortly after the meeting in Red Deer had been scheduled to take place, SS-88 made another posting to Stormfront.org. The posting was titled, Western Canada For Us (WCFU) \/ Posters of me in Red Deer. In the posting SS-88 describes that a poster about him had been circulated in Red Deer by the ARA. SS-88 described the poster in detail and noted that a photograph of him was attached to the poster. Sergeant Camp contacted the complainant, Richard Warman, and asked whether he could obtain a copy of this poster and the attached photograph. The Sergeant received copies from Mr. Warman, which copies were entered as evidence during the hearing. The poster had a very similar layout to that described in the posting made by SS-88, and had almost identical content. The photograph attached to the poster was of the respondent, Glenn Bahr.\n[52] On March 1, 2004, SS-88 posted on stormfront.org a posting titled Happy Birthday Paul Fromm. The posting reads: Happy birthday Paul!! You sure don\u2019t look 56, I would have guessed 30! Glenn\n[53] In January of 2004, SS-88 made a posting to a stormfront.org discussion forum titled Tattoos: I have an SS on my right pec, Blizkrieg across the top of my back. I have an iron cross with skull on my right arm and an eagle with a Maple Leaf in its wing on my left arm.\n[54] On May 7, 2004, Sergeant Camp executed a search warrant at the respondent, Mr. Bahr\u2019s home in relation to the Criminal Code charge laid against Mr. Bahr and described earlier. The Sergeant testified that while executing the search warrant, he asked Mr. Bahr to describe his tattoos. Mr. Bahr described that he had an SS symbol on his chest, the word Blizkrieg across his back, an eagle with a Canadian Flag and a skull with flames.\n[55] The Sergeant testified that during the execution of this search warrant, Mr. Bahr admitted that he was in charge of the WCFU website and undertook to shut the website down. The next day, being May 8, 2004, SS-88 posted to stormfront.org: There will be no meet. WCFU is now disbanded. Later that same day SS-88 posted to stormfront.org: Due to certain circumstances WCFU as an organization and website are finished permanently. On May 8, 2004 the WCFU website was removed from the Internet.\n[56] The complainant alleges that Glenn Bahr began to use the pseudonym Glenn on the WCFU in or about March of 2004. The evidence in support of this allegation follows.\n[57] In March of 2004 SS-88 posted to stormfront.org that he will shortly post pictures taken of a rally held in Edmonton, Alberta, in support of Ernst Zundel on the WCFU website. Shortly thereafter, Glenn posted the pictures of a rally in support of Ernst Zundel on the WCFU website. Pictures of another rally in support of Ernst Zundel held in Toronto were also posted on the WCFU website by Glenn.\n[58] In March of 2004, Glenn posted on the WCFU website: Next Sunday I\u2019ll be doing a radio interview with Peter Warren at 12 noon Alberta time on CKNW Corus Radio Network. A recording of an interview conducted during that show was introduced into evidence. The recording indicated that the interview guest was an individual named Glenn Bahr. The interview included a call-in segment. Listeners were invited to call in and ask questions or direct comments to Mr. Bahr. One caller suggested that Mr. Bahr was at the time using the pseudonym SS-88 on the WCFU website. Glenn Bahr responded, My name is Glenn on the WCFU website.\n[59] Sergeant Camp testified that the Edmonton Police Service Technological Crimes Section was instructed to complete a forensic analysis of Mr. Bahr\u2019s two computers. The Sergeant testified that he was advised that the person accessing one of these computers as Administrator also accessed the web based e-mail accounts of SS-88@hotmail.com and glennbahr@yahoo.ca. The person who accessed as the website as Administrator also accessed the administrative pages of the WCFU website forum as Glenn, and accessed the stormfront.org and other websites as users schadenfrog andSS-88. The Sergeant was further advised that the person accessing the second computer as Administrator also accessed the e-mail accounts of SS-88@hotmail.com and glennbahr@yahoo.ca; accessed the administrative pages of the WCFU website forum as SS-88 and the stormfront.org website as SS-88.\n[60] On the basis of this evidence, I find that the complainant and the Commission have made out a prima facie case that the person accessing the WCFU website as SS-88 and Glenn was the respondent, Glenn Bahr and that the person accessing the stormfront.org website as SS-88, was also this respondent.\n[61] The evidentiary burden lies with the complainant and the Commission to establish their case on a balance of probabilities. Where, however, a prima facie case has been made out in respect of an allegation, a respondent must provide a reasonable explanation, either that the conduct alleged did not occur or that the conduct did not constitute a discriminatory practice. (Warman v. Kulbashian (supra) at para. 114).\n[62] Mr. Bahr did not lead any evidence that would suggest that he did not use these pseudonyms. I find that the person accessing the WCFU and stormfront.org websites as SS-88 was the respondent, Glenn Bahr and further that Mr. Bahr was the person accessing the WCFU website as Glenn.\n(ii) Did Glenn Bahr have control over the WCFU website? [63] The complainant and the Commission allege that the respondent, Glenn Bahr, either alone or with others, had control of the WCFU website. In particular, they allege Glenn Bahr had control over the administration of the website and was able to control the content of the site. The evidence led to support this allegation is as follows.\n[64] Sergeant Camp testified that he reviewed a posting on stormfront.org dated December of 2003 made by SS-88 which read as follows: If you need a website done to promote your plan, I can offer you my services free of charge. Just e-mail me.\n[65] The Sergeant testified there was much discussion in early March of 2004 on the stormfront.org Canada discussion forum about the WCFU, and a website that was being created. The discussion included comments and suggestions about content for the site, and also included suggested changes to proposed content. As will be seen, these postings demonstrate clearly that SS-88, being the respondent, Glenn Bahr, took an active role in the creation of the website. A selection of the postings made to the stormfront.org website is as follows:\nOn March 3, 2004, SS-88 posted: I made some suggested changes to the site, and later that day, SS-88 posted: Thanx man for the help with proofreading the site. I will try and get that copy up tonight after work. Appreciate it! March 4, 2004, SS-88 posted: . . . I will program in the pics and add the content, and later that day, SS-88 posted: Thanx everyone but I have it under control. These things don\u2019t happen overnight. I\u2019m working on the site and it will be up soon. Be patient theres a lot involved in a big site. On March 8, 2004, SS-88 posted: Our website is now active. I\u2019m still adding content etc but please come stop by and take part. The posting has a link to www.wcfu.com, the WCFU website.\n[66] I find that the complainant and the Commission have made out a prima facie case that the respondent, Glenn Bahr, played a significant role in the creation of the WCFU website. The complainant and the Commission also allege that Mr. Bahr continued to have significant control over the website after its launch. The evidence led to support this allegation is as follows.\n[67] On the WCFU website, first SS-88, and later Glenn is identified as the head administrator. Further, SS-88, and then Glenn contributed material to the site on a regular basis. The material posted by SS-88 and Glenn included photographs of protest rallies, postings of newspaper articles on different subjects, and postings on the discussion forum.\n[68] Sergeant Camp testified that the EPS forensic analysis on the first computer seized during the execution of the search warrant disclosed that the person accessing the WCFU website as Glenn had administrative rights on the website and so was able to add, delete and modify the content of the site and to control its layout. This person also had administrative powers over the discussion forum and could control the content of postings by banning the use of certain words and could delete postings from the forum. The person also controlled the manner by which members were authenticated and could ban members from posting to the forum. The forensic analysis of the second computer disclosed that the person accessing the website as SS-88 had these same administrative rights.\n[69] During the radio interview discussed earlier, Glenn Bahr, in response to a question from a caller, acknowledged that he had banned some members from the discussion forum where he considered their participation to be problematic. Mr. Bahr was able to ensure that these banned members could not gain access to the discussion forum.\n[70] As mentioned earlier, Sergeant Camp testified that while he was executing the search warrant at Glenn Bahr\u2019s home in May of 2004, Mr. Bahr admitted that he controlled the website. He also undertook to shut the site down. The next day the WCFU website disappeared from the Internet.\n[71] On the basis of this evidence, I find that the complainant and the Commission have made out a prima facie case that the respondent, Glenn Bahr, was instrumental in creating the WCFU website, and that he had control of the website from its inception until the time the website was taken from the Internet. As no evidence was tendered by the respondent that would tend to counter this evidence, I find that Mr. Bahr controlled, himself, or in concert with others, the WCFU website.\n(iii) Did Glenn Bahr communicate, or cause to be communicated, the material available for download on the WCFU website? [72] While Mr. Bahr did not author the material contained on the Downloads portion of the website, s. 13(1) does not require authorship; just communication of the offending material. (See Warman v. Kyburz [2003] CHRT 18). I have found that Mr. Bahr had administrative control over the WCFU website, and I find for that reason that he, either alone or in concert with others, installed the material contained in the Downloads section, and that he did accordingly communicate or cause to be communicated that material.\n(iv) Did Glenn Bahr communicate the impugned postings as alleged? [73] The Complainant alleges that the respondent, Glenn Bahr made two postings to the WCFU website discussion forum: The Treaty Song, posted on March 18, 2004 and a posting contributed to a discussion thread titled Homosexuals made on March 10, 2004. Both of these postings were made by SS-88. I have found that SS-88 was Glenn Bahr\u2019s pseudonym on the WCFU website, and it is reasonable to conclude that, in the result, Mr. Bahr made the impugned postings. I find that a prima facie case has been made out that the respondent, Glenn Bahr made the impugned postings.\n[74] As mentioned earlier, the respondent, Glenn Bahr did not give evidence at the hearing. Through his representative however, Mr. Bahr denied making the postings, alleging that a third party gained unauthorized access to his WCFU website pseudonym and made the impugned postings. The evidence led by this respondent in support of this allegation is as follows.\n[75] An affidavit sworn by Kent Dahl, a Constable with the RCMP detachment in Red Deer, was filed in evidence. This affidavit states that Mr. Bahr attended at the detachment and filed a complaint on March 19, 2004. The Constable describes that Mr. Bahr reported receiving threatening e-mails and telephone calls. Mr. Bahr also reported that a poster had been distributed in Red Deer alleging that he was a white supremacist, causing him to lose his job and his apartment. The Constable deposes that Glenn Bahr was unwilling to allow the RCMP access to his computer for their investigation, and that he did not deliver to the RCMP copies of the e-mails he complained about. Constable Dahl deposed that as a result, the RCMP was unable to pursue this complaint. It is further deposed by the Constable that Mr. Bahr advised him in April of 2004 that he had moved to Edmonton and no longer wished to pursue the matter.\n[76] A transcript was prepared from an audio tape made of the interview Glenn Bahr gave to Constable Dahl at the time he made his complaint. The transcript confirms that the focus of Mr. Bahr\u2019s complaint was the distribution of the posters and the threatening phone calls and e-mails.\n[77] The transcript also discloses that in addition to the matters deposed to by Constable Dahl, Glenn Bahr reported that he was receiving what he described as fake e-mails. He described, for example, that he had received e-mails apparently written by a person known to him. He learned later that the e-mails were not written by the person known to him - they had been sent by a third party who had obtained unauthorized access to the e-mail account of his acquaintance. Mr. Bahr advised that he suspected a member or members of either or both of the ARA or the Communist party were involved. Mr. Bahr also reported that persons were breaking in to his MSN instant messaging account, and that of some of his acquaintances and were impersonating him and his friends during chat sessions.\n[78] Mr. Bahr did not report to the Constable that anyone had impersonated him in relation to postings made to discussion forums in general or to the WCFU website in particular. The mischief he complains about is limited to his receipt of fake e-mails and interference with MSN instant messaging accounts. None of the impugned material consist of e-mail messages or instant messages.\n[79] Mr. Bernard Klatt gave testimony on Mr. Bahr\u2019s behalf after being qualified as an expert on computer technology and the Internet. Mr. Klatt testified that it is possible for persons to take control of, or hack into the computer of another and described various methods that could be employed by the unscrupulous to take such control. For the most part, these methods required a hacker to trick a person to disclose his or her computer password. Documents describing different hacking methods used over the internet were entered as evidence in the hearing.\n[80] Mr. Klatt\u2019s evidence was that control of one\u2019s computer could be assumed by another. Mr. Klatt did not give evidence that would tend to demonstrate that Mr. Bahr\u2019s computer was in fact hacked, or that would tend to demonstrate that Mr. Bahr was the victim of any other unauthorized conduct. Mr. Klatt did not testify that an unauthorized user was impersonating Mr. Bahr on the WCFU discussion forum.\n[81] Does this evidence serve as a reasonable explanation of the evidence of the complainant and the Commission? Member Hadjis describes in Warman v. Kulbashian that where a prima facie case is made out, the Respondent must provide a reasonable explanation and further that the explanation must entail more than hints and innuendo.\n[82] I find that the evidence tendered by the Respondent does not constitute a reasonable explanation and does not tend to demonstrate that the conduct did not occur. Mr. Bahr did not, in his complaint to the Red Deer RCMP, complain that some person was impersonating him on the WCFU website discussion forum, making postings that were not his composition. His complaint of mischief regarding his computer were limited to the receipt of fake e-mails and that his MSN instant messaging account was hacked into. Further, Mr. Klatt\u2019s evidence was only that it is possible for a person to gain unauthorized access to the computer of another. He did not testify that any person did in fact gain such access to Mr. Bahr\u2019s computer at any time relevant to this complaint. This evidence is insufficient to displace the prima facie case made out by the complainant and the Respondent. I find on all of the evidence that the respondent, Mr. Bahr, made the postings as alleged by the complainant and the Commission.\nF. Did the Respondent, WCFU communicate, or cause to be communicated, the impugned material? (i) Preliminary Issue: Is the Respondent, WCFU, a group of persons for the purpose of s. 13(1)? [83] The respondent, WCFU, did not appear at the hearing. In earlier written submissions however, WCFU argued that it was not a person or a group of persons for the purpose of s. 13(1) and is accordingly not a proper party to this complaint. WCFU will be a group of persons for the purpose of s. 13(1) if there is, on the evidence, adequate indicia that it constitutes a group of people who have organized themselves under that name, regardless of whether the group has a formal legal status (see Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Western Guard Party and John Ross Taylor, (July 20, 1979) (Can. Trib.; Leddy, Lederman and Volpini) [unreported] at p. 41, see also Nealy v. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450 at para. 45641.\n[84] I find that WCFU was a group of persons within the meaning of s. 13 of the CHRA, capable of engaging in the discriminatory conduct alleged herein. In reaching this conclusion one need not go much further than the following posting made to the WCFU website in May of 2004, by Glenn, who I have found to be the respondent, Glenn Bahr:\nThe Alberta Chapter of WCFU is the head chapter of Western Canada For Us. This is where all of the decisions are made. They have representatives in Edmonton, Three Hills and Calgary. WCFU distributes most of the material and organizes most of our protests. WCFU Alberta holds monthly meetings where we discuss provincial and national issues and see what we can do to help out our fellow Euro-Canadians. The posting ends: Glenn Bahr, Alberta Chapter and WCFU President, Albertachapter@WCFU.com and solicits donations by mail to Ste. 306, 10654 Whyte Ave., Edmonton, AB.\n[85] From this posting to the WCFU website it is clear that this group has an organizational structure, it has Chapters, at least three representatives and a President. The group distributes material, holds regular meetings, organizes events, has a post office box, created a website and has articulated a mission of helping fellow Euro-Canadians.\n[86] Further, Sergeant Camp testified that in March of 2004, the Old Strathcona Community Police Station in Edmonton, Alberta called the Hate Crimes Unit and reported that they had received complaints that business cards had been distributed in the community. The business card was obtained by the Sergeant and was introduced into evidence. The card read: Glenn Bahr, Alberta Chapter and WCFU President, Alberta, Canada and contained two Internet addresses: www.wcfu.com and albertachapter@wcfu.com. This latter address also accessed the WCFU website.\n[87] Sergeant Camp also testified that he was contacted by the Leduc, Alberta RCMP detachment in early May of 2004. Officers from that detachment had received complaints about persons distributing pamphlets in the area. The officers forwarded the pamphlet to Sergeant Camp who introduced it as evidence at the hearing. The pamphlet had photographs of two Caucasian children and was entitled For their sakes. The bottom of the pamphlet had the name of and postal address for Western Canada For Us. The pamphlet also identified the website addresses of www.wcfu.com and albertachapter@wcfu.com.\n[88] The evidence also demonstrates that Glenn Bahr was the leader and founder of WCFU. In addition to the evidence described above, there is the radio interview described earlier. At the commencement of this interview, Glenn Bahr is introduced by the host as the president and founder of the Western Canada For Us group and as the head of the Alberta Chapter of the organization. Further, on April 27, 2004 Glenn posted a copy of a letter to the editor submitted to the Winnipeg Sun. The letter challenges an article published in that newspaper describing that a Manitoba chapter of the WCFU, described as a white supremacist group, was attempting to establish itself in Winnipeg. The letter is signed Glenn Bahr, President and Founder, WCFU Alberta Chapter.\n(ii) Did WCFU communicate the impugned material? [89] The respondent, WCFU, created and controlled a website. WCFU, by installing the website and its content, communicated or caused to be communicated that content, including the impugned material (see Warman v. Kulbashian [2006] CHRT 11).\n[90] In finding that WCFU communicated or caused to be communicated the impugned material, I am mindful of s. 13(3) of the CHRA which states that:\n. . . no owner or operator of a telecommunication undertaking communicates or causes to be communicated any matter described in subsection (1) by reason only that the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking owned or operated by that person are used by other persons for the transmission of that matter.\n[91] The purpose of this section is to absolve from liability persons who merely provide facilities for others to use. Such a person would not then be liable for the manner in which that facility was used. By installing the discussion forum on its website, the WCFU provided a facility designed to be used by whomever might wish to commence or contribute to a discussion. Some persons used this facility in a manner I have found to be likely to expose persons identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination to hatred or contempt. Should WCFU be found to be responsible for the comments posted to the discussion forum? Is s. 13(3) applicable to and does it afford a defence to WCFU in respect of that content? I find that the section does not apply on the facts of this case and does not afford a defence to WCFU.\n[92] Member Hadjis of this Tribunal noted that this section affords a defence to persons whose involvement is limited to ownership or operation of facilities in relation to messages communicated by reason only that the facilities were used. On the facts of that case the Member found that a respondent could not avail itself of s. 13(3) where its participation in the facility was not benign in its character. The member found that the respondent in that case provided web hosting services, but also that the respondent actively encouraged the communication of hate messages over its server. The member concluded that the respondent\u2019s participation with the facility was not benign in its nature and so could not avail itself of the defence provided in s. 13(1) (Warman v. Kulbashian [2006] CHRT 11 at para 119).\n[93] I agree with Member Hadjis\u2019 analysis and find in this case that the WCFU website was similarly not benign in its character. When viewed in its entirety, the site is clearly designed to provoke discussion that is likely to be hateful in nature. There are links to neo-Nazi and white supremacist sites, Nazi memorabilia and literature including the three works discussed in this decision. The website was designed to attract visitors who share the views expressed in this and other content of the website or who might be convinced to adopt such views. Hateful messages are a likely, if not inevitable, result of the manner in which this website is designed. Thus WCFU\u2019 conduct as an owner or operator of telecommunication facilities used by others was not benign and accordingly the defence contained in s. 13(3) has no application. I find that the WCFU communicated or caused to be communicated the impugned postings made to the discussion forum.\nIV. Remedies [94] The Commission and the complainant request that the Tribunal issue several orders pursuant to s. 54(1) of the CHRA.\nA. An order that the discriminatory practice cease (s. 54(1)(a)) [95] Section 54(1)(a) empowers the Tribunal to order a respondent to cease the discriminatory practice, and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or prevent it from occurring in the future.\n[96] Accordingly, I order the respondents, Glenn Bahr and Western Canada For Us, to cease and desist from communicating or causing to be communicated, by the means described in s. 13 of the CHRA, namely the Internet, any material of the type found in this decision to be likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that the person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nB. Penalty [97] The Tribunal may order a respondent who engaged in a discriminatory practice as set out in s. 13, to pay a penalty of up to $10,000.00 pursuant to s. 54(1)(c). The purpose of this section is not to compensate an individual complainant, but rather to reflect society\u2019s opprobrium for the respondent\u2019s conduct (Schnell, supra., at para 163 and see Warman v. Kyburz [2003], CHRT 18 at para. 94). Section 54 (1.1) spells out several factors that the Tribunal must take into account when deciding whether to make such an order:\n- the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice; - the wilfulness or intent of the respondent, any prior discriminatory practices, and the respondent\u2019s ability to pay the penalty.\n[98] While Mr. Bahr did not author the material found on the Downloads section of the website, I have found that he caused this material to be communicated. I have also found that Mr. Bahr made the Treaty Song posting and the first of the two postings made to the discussion forum thread titled Homosexuals. I find that the material was communicated wilfully by this Respondent.\n[99] Insofar as the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practices are concerned, I have found that Mr. Bahr repeatedly communicated or caused to be communicated, messages regarding Jewish people, homosexuals, the mentally disabled, blacks and other non-whites that were vicious and extreme in their characterization. The materials communicated expressed hatred and contempt in respect of members of these various groups and invited others to hold these persons in hatred and contempt. Some of the material considered in these reasons advocates for the extermination of Jewish people, homosexuals and persons suffering mental disabilities. This weighs heavily in favour of the assessment of a significant penalty.\n[100] No evidence was led to suggest that the respondent, Mr. Bahr, had engaged in any prior discriminatory practices. I understand that the charges laid against Mr. Bahr under s. 319(2) of the Criminal Code arose from the same or substantially the same material as was considered in this proceeding, and not to prior separate discriminatory conduct.\n[101] That the website was shut down by Mr. Bahr almost immediately after Sergeant Camp executed a search warrant at his apartment is a mitigating factor.\n[102] I heard no direct evidence of the details of Mr. Bahr\u2019s financial circumstances. I note however, that s. 50(3) of the CHRA authorizes the Tribunal to accept whatever evidence and other information that it sees fit, whether or not that evidence would be admissible in a court of law (see Warman v. Kyburz (supra) at para 98; Warman v. Kulbashian (supra) at para 149). Mr. Bahr, through his representative, made it clear that the costs of the hearing were onerous on this respondent. I find that Mr. Bahr is an individual of modest means and that his ability to pay is restricted.\n[103] While the seriousness of the section 13 breach would otherwise call for a fine at or near the maximum permissible under the legislation, being $10,000.00, these factors have persuaded the Tribunal that a somewhat reduced penalty is appropriate. I order Mr. Bahr to pay a penalty in the amount of $5,000.00. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of Mr. Bahr\u2019s being notified of this decision.\n[104] With regard to the respondent, Western Canada For Us, I find, for reasons set out above, that the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practices as well as the wilfulness of WCFU\u2019s conduct, weigh heavily in favour of the assessment of a significant penalty. As did the respondent, Glenn Bahr, WCFU communicated repeatedly material that was vicious and extreme.\n[105] I have no evidence of any prior discriminatory practices engaged in by WCFU. I note, however, that this group appears to have been established in or about March of 2004, shortly before the website was established. It is the content of the website that is the subject matter of this complaint. I find that this group did not engage in prior discriminatory practices.\n[106] I heard no evidence of this respondent\u2019s ability to pay, though I note that the evidence suggests that WCFU has now been disbanded.\n[107] In all of the circumstances, I order that WCFU pay a penalty in the amount of $5,000.00. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada.\n[108] While this respondent did not appear at the hearing, I have found that Glenn Bahr was the founder and leader of the organization. I therefore order that the penalty must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of the date when Mr. Bahr receives this decision.\nSigned by\nJulie Lloyd Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario December 1, 2006\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal Files: T1087\/6805 et T1088\/6905\nStyle of Cause: Richard Warman v.

Hadjis\n[1] The Canadian Human Rights Commission has made a motion containing essentially two requests for additional disclosure of documents and material that are allegedly in Mr. Lemire's possession.\nThe First Request [2] The first disclosure request is set out as follows:\nAll information within the possession of Marc Lemire without exception of entire contents of his website which he administers, as well as all the literature (books) referred to on this website and the entire website including all additions (such as information regarding the Commission's announced expert) to it since September 24, 1999 and up to date on the date of the hearing (sic throughout).\n[3] This paragraph can be broken down into two sections:\n(i) The ...entire contents of [Mr. Lemire's] website which he administers... from September 24, 1999 ... to ... the date of the hearing.\n[4] According to Mr. Warman's complaint, the matter that is alleged to be in violation of s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act is found on the website known as freedomsite.org, which includes the website's message board chat.freedomsite.org. The complaint alleges that Mr. Lemire is the registered owner of the website. The content of this website therefore clearly relates to a fact or issue in this case, within the meaning of Rule 6 (1)(d) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. Consequently, any documents that relate to this content, which are within Mr. Lemire's possession, are subject to disclosure, pursuant to this Rule. I take the term documents to include any text or other information stored or recorded in electronic format.\n[5] The complaint also states that the dates of the alleged discriminatory practices are 24 September 1999 and ongoing. Evidence relating to the ongoing nature of alleged violations of the Act that post-date a complaint can be considered by a Tribunal inquiring into the complaint (Warman v. Kouba, 2006 CHRT 50 at paras. 17-19).\n[6] Mr. Lemire is therefore ordered to disclose to the Commission and Mr. Warman, by December 15, 2006, any content of the above-noted website of which Mr. Lemire is still in possession, for the period commencing on September 24, 1999, and onwards.\n[7] The Commission indicated in its submissions that it is willing to receive all of this material in electronic format, on CD-ROM, thereby sparing Mr. Lemire from the necessity of making physical or hard copies of the material. Mr. Lemire may disclose the material in this manner if he so chooses.\n[8] In his own submissions, Mr. Lemire contends that the Commission already downloaded at least some of the website's content, in January 2004, and that the Commission did not disclose this downloaded material to him. He asks that a CD-ROM copy of this downloaded material be produced. In my view, this material relates to the issues and facts of this case and if it exists and is still in the Commission's possession, it must be disclosed to Mr. Lemire, by December 7, 2006. Thereafter, Mr. Lemire will only be required to disclose any of the website content that is not already present on this CD-ROM.\n(ii) ...all the literature (books) referred to on this website....\n[9] With respect to this request, the Commission is seeking disclosure of advertised literature sold on [the] website. The Commission contends that references on websites to external literature may indirectly expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act. This argument does not strike me as implausible. Much will depend, it would seem, on the specific circumstances of the case. The material is therefore arguably relevant to an issue in the case and consequently is subject to disclosure.\n[10] That said, there is nothing in the schedule attached to the Commission's submissions to indicate that any such external literature was in fact being sold on the website. Rather, it appears to be a list of titles of articles or books. All of the titles are underlined, which when visiting websites often means that by clicking the underlined word or phrase, one can be redirected to a new web page. This raises the possibility that some or all of the literature's content is available, through these links, on the website itself. Pursuant to the preceding disclosure order in this ruling, that material will be disclosed.\n[11] If, however, any of this literature is not available on the website itself, and Mr. Lemire is in possession of this material, he must disclose it to the Commission and the Complainant. The Commission recognizes, in its submissions, that making copies of this material could prove to be a very onerous and costly task for Mr. Lemire. The Commission therefore suggests that Mr. Lemire simply be required to make these documents available for viewing. This is a reasonable option. Mr. Lemire is therefore required to provide the material to his counsel, Ms. Kulaska, who will in turn make the documents available for viewing by the Commission and Mr. Warman. The parties are expected to cooperate with each other in this regard in order to ensure that this disclosure is completed by December 31, 2006.\nThe Second Request [12] The second disclosure request is set out as follows:\nAll materials, transcripts, statements, speeches from other hearings or from elsewhere that the Respondent has in his possession.\n[13] This disclosure request is not granted. As I mentioned in a previous decision regarding disclosure in this case (Warman v. Lemire, 2006 CHRT 32, at paras. 40-42), requests such as this, which are over-reaching and lacking in specificity, will be denied.\n[14] It appears from the Commission's submissions that its intent, in making this request, was to ensure that Mr. Lemire discloses all information and material related to all the issues and facts of this case. However, Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure already requires this level of disclosure from all parties. A specific order against one of the parties simply reiterating this requirement is therefore unnecessary.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

ANALYSIS\n(i) Expert report by Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9\n(ii) Certificate of Dr. Rodrigue\nIII. DECISION\n[1] The Tribunal is seized with a complaint in which it is alleged that the complainant, Micheline Montreuil, was discriminated against by the respondent, the Canadian Armed Forces, because of her sex and a perception of disability when they refused to allow her to enlist in the Forces in 1999.\n[2] On October 6, 2006, the Canadian Armed Forces presented a motion for the complainant to disclose two documents, the expert report by Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, dated March 18, 1999, and the disability certificate by Dr. Jean Rodrigue, dated January 5, 1998.\n[3] The complainant objected to the disclosure of these documents, claiming they were not relevant and were subject to confidentiality.\n[4] This motion was first referred to Karen Jensen for adjudication. In a decision rendered October 16, 2006, the latter referred the motion back to the member assigned to hear the complaint.\n[5] During the hearing of this motion, the Tribunal heard two witnesses, Dr. Pierre Assalian and the complainant, Micheline Montreuil.\nI. POSITION OF THE PARTIES A. Position of the Canadian Armed Forces [6] In its request for disclosure, the respondent is requiring the Tribunal to order that the complainant disclose the information regarding her medical condition that had not been sent in support of the complainant's enlistment application of July 13, 1999, and not disclosed to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, the Canadian Forces, and the Tribunal in the present proceedings. These documents consist of the medical expert report by Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, psychiatrist, dated March 18, 1998, and the disability report by Dr. Jean Rodrigue, dated January 5, 1998.\n[7] The Tribunal notes that no obligation is made under the disclosure rules to submit any particular documents to the Tribunal. Disclosure takes place between the parties to a complaint without the Tribunal being a party.\n[8] In its request, the respondent claims that the complainant wrongly did not disclose these two reports that, it claims, relate to the complainant's medical condition. It claims that the complainant did not respect the meaning and scope of the Tribunal's order, rendered November 28, 2005. We will get back to this.\n[9] The respondent claims that the medical information in the two documents described above have to do with the claimant's sex-change procedure and allow for the claimant's state of health to be assessed.\n[10] In its written arguments, the respondent claims that the medical documents in question are essential to understanding the complainant's complete medical history.\nB. Position of the complainant [11] In her written response to the respondent's request, the complainant states that the documents the respondent is seeking to have disclosed are not relevant to the case, that they are part of a labour relations file, and that they are subject to confidentiality.\n[12] Moreover, the complainant states that the medical expertise of Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 does not fall into the category of documents mentioned by my colleague, Karen Jensen, in her November 28, 2005, ruling.\nC. Position of the Canadian Human Rights Commission [13] The Commission's position can be found in a letter addressed to the Tribunal on October 12, 2006.\n[14] The Commission supports the complainant's position regarding her refusal to disclose the two documents described above because they are not relevant to the issues in question in this complaint. The Commission argues that the medical reports were prepared strictly for a grievance filed by the complainant against her former employer and affect only the validity of the consent the complainant gave regarding her resignation from Coll\u00e8ge Garneau, on December 4, 1997. For the Commission, the request for disclosure of these documents is a fishing expedition.\n[15] Moreover, the Commission states that the documents being requested cannot be used to support the Canadian Armed Forces decision to deny the complainant's enlistment application.\nII. ANALYSIS [16] At the outset, it is important to state that it is not the complainant's general medical condition that is at issue in this case, but her medical condition concerning her identity as a transgender or transsexual person. This was clearly established in the decision rendered by my colleague Jensen on November 28, 2005; a decision that, we must remember, addressed the medical information regarding the complainant held by Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9.\n[17] In her decision, my colleague Jensen defined the parameters for the disclosure of the medical documents related to this case. According to her, and I quote, ...only those medical files dealing with Ms. Montreuil's involvement in the sex-change process and her sexual identity are to be disclosed. Therefore, it is not the medical documents concerning the complainant's general medical state that are relevant in this case, but those concerning the sex-change and sexual identity of the complainant.\n[18] We will now look at the two documents for which the respondent is requesting disclosure.\n(i) Expert report by Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 [19] It must be mentioned here that the expert report by Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 has already been the subject of a request for disclosure in this case. In fact, the file and the evidence show that in September 2005, the respondent filed a motion for disclosure pertaining to three documents, i.e. the medical files of Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, Dr. Roland Tremblay and Dr. Martine Lehoux. At the time, the complainant objected to the disclosure of these files on the ground that they were not relevant to the allegation of discrimination the complainant made against the Canadian Armed Forces.\n[20] In her decision dated November 28, 2005, my colleague Jensen found, as we stated above, that only the medical files regarding Ms. Montreuil's sex-change and sexual identity were to be disclosed. She ordered, that the complete medical files of Micheline Montreuil (or Pierre Montreuil, as she was previously known)...from the following physicians be disclosed: Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, Dr. Roland Tremblay and Dr. Martine Lehoux. The decision by my colleague Jensen was made without her personally consulting the documents in question.\n[21] Moreover, Ms. Jensen stated in her decision that to protect Ms. Montreuil's right to confidentiality, the documents were to be transmitted to counsel for the Canadian Armed Forces and not to any other person without the Tribunal first giving consent and Ms. Montreuil being notified. She also indicated that the documents could be consulted by medical experts hired by the Canadian Forces, but only for the purposes of the present case and were not to be used for any purpose that was not related to the present case.\n[22] At the hearing of this motion, the parties reminded the Tribunal that it should not stray from Ms. Jensen's decision, which provided the guidelines for the debate over the medical documents that were to be disclosed by the complainant.\n[23] Today, the evidence shows that Ms. Montreuil did not consult Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 in the context of a sex-change process, but as an expert to assess whether her decision to resign, in the context of a grievance Ms. Montreuil filed following her resignation from Coll\u00e8ge Garneau on December 4, 1997, was a free and informed choice.\n[24] The evidence shows that the complainant did not consult Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 as an attending physician, but as an expert. This being said, regarding the order he received to communicate the complete medical file he had on the complainant to counsel for the Canadian Armed Forces, Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 informed then-counsel for the Canadian Armed Forces, Claude Morissette, on two occasions, that he no longer had possession of the expert report concerning the grievance filed by the complainant in 1998, because he did not keep files for more than five years. However, the evidence shows that the expert report, while no longer in Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9's possession, is in the possession of the complainant and third parties identified by the complainant at the hearing.\n[25] It must be noted that had it not been for Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9's practice to not keep his medical expertise files for more than five years, Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9, upon the Tribunal's order, would have communicated his March 1998 expert report to the respondent.\n[26] This being said, it is important, in light of the new facts revealed by the evidence, to determine whether this expert report by Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 meets the requirements for likelihood of relevance that governs the disclosure of documents in cases of complaints of discrimination based on the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[27] At the outset, it is important to note that we are not at a stage in these proceedings where the Tribunal is to assess the probative value of the document in terms of the allegation of discrimination made by the complainant, but the appearance or likelihood of the document's relevance in terms of the issues at bar.\n[28] The disclosure of the expert report to the respondent does not necessarily mean the document will be produced. If the respondent planned to file the document as evidence, the Tribunal would need to determine both its admissibility and its probative value, in terms of the allegation of discrimination submitted by the complainant.\n[29] There is no doubt that the complainant's condition as a transgender or transsexual person is an issue in question regarding the claim of discrimination, as is the issue of her sexual identity.\n[30] Therefore, insomuch as a document relates to these two elements, transgender or transsexual condition or sexual identity, the document acquires a likelihood of relevance.\n[31] It must be noted that part of the content of Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9's expert report, for which the respondent seeks disclosure, is known. In the excerpt of the arbitral sentence submitted in support of Dr. Assalian's affidavit, are the findings that appear in Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9's report. The findings report on the fact that, for the first time in her life, the complainant was confronted by her double identity.\n[32] Moreover, in the motion for judicial review of the arbitral sentence, there are many paragraphs on the testimony given by Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 before the arbitrator who rendered the arbitral sentence.\n[33] Thus, at paragraph 137, the applicant, the teacher's union of Coll\u00e8ge Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Garneau, claims that the arbitrator reported only a small part of the testimony given by Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9, the author of the expert report. In particular, at paragraph 137.3, the applicant stated that Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9, in his testimony, claimed that the complainant suffered from duality, anxiety and anguish.\n[34] At paragraph 137.7, the applicant alleges that the respondent, the Coll\u00e8ge, neglected to mention that Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 stated that the internal conflict of the complainant's personality between Pierre and Micheline meant that the complainant was unable to analyze all the aspects.\n[35] It seems that Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 addressed the issue of the complainant's dual personality and her internal personality conflict during his testimony regarding his expert report. The Tribunal is of the view that these are two other elements that are relevant to the case opposing the complainant and the respondent.\n[36] It is also important to note that it is not at this point in the proceedings that the Tribunal is to rule on the validity of the parties' opposing claims or on the admissibility or probative value of the expert report; the Tribunal must determine whether the expert report has a likelihood of relevance to the issues the Tribunal will be deciding.\n[37] The Tribunal therefore finds that the expert report by Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9 of March 18, 1998, must be disclosed to the respondent.\n[38] Before the Tribunal, the complainant argued that the report was confidential because it was medical in nature and was produced under the terms of an agreement that was also confidential.\n[39] As for the confidentiality of the report, the Tribunal intends on using the same disclosure conditions that appear in Karen Jensen's decision of November 28, 2005.\n[40] It must be stated here that the content of Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9's report has already been disclosed in a number of proceedings. The findings at which Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 arrived are even reproduced in the arbitral sentence.\n[41] That being said, given the special circumstances of this case, this is not a reason to no longer ensure the protection of the disclosed information regarding third parties that would have no reason to read the report.\n(ii) Certificate of Dr. Rodrigue [42] Now, regarding the certificate of Dr. Rodrigue in this case, the respondent claims that the document is relevant because it relates to the complainant's sex-change process and her sexual identity.\n[43] During her testimony, the complainant clearly stated the circumstances and the reasons for which the disability certificate was written by Dr. Rodrigue; reasons essentially related to the collective agreement that required such a document to be produced.\n[44] In his sentence, the arbitrator Morin, who read the disability certificate completed by Dr. Rodrigue, declared that he could not rely on this document as evidence of a genuine disability. His opinion was that the certificate, produced one month after the events, appeared to conform too closely to the calendar negotiated by the parties for the agreement reached between the complainant, her union, and the Coll\u00e8ge.\n[45] At paragraph 6 of his affidavit, Dr. Assalian states having read an excerpt from the arbitral sentence dated February 4, 2000, regarding the complainant, her union and the Coll\u00e8ge Garneau. At the hearing, Dr. Assalian admitted to not having read the decision and the arbitrator's reasons, as they appeared at Tab 4 of Exhibit RP-18 at pages 9 et seq.\n[46] In the Tribunal's opinion, these pages are important for deciding on the relevance of the disability certificate written by Dr. Rodrigue in the present motion. It is unfortunate that Dr. Assalian did not read them.\n[47] Upon analysis of the documents submitted, the Tribunal feels that there is no indication that the disability report written by Dr. Rodrigue contains any information whatsoever on the complainant's transgender or transsexual condition, her sex-change procedure or even on her sexual identity.\n[48] It is difficult to maintain that the excerpt from the arbitral sentence produced in support of Dr. Assalian's affidavit contains any element that relates to the complainant's transgender or transsexual condition.\n[49] The fact that the document was written by a general practitioner a few months before the complainant's application to enlist in the Canadian Armed Forces is not enough to establish a likelihood of relevance for the issues in question in the present case.\n[50] Hence, the Tribunal does not grant the respondent's application to order the complainant to disclose the disability certificate written by Dr. Rodrigue.\nIII. DECISION [51] As a result, the Tribunal orders the complainant to disclose forthwith the expert report of Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9 dated March 18, 1988, to the respondent party.\n[52] To protect the complainant's right to confidentiality, the expert report of Dr. Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9 shall be transmitted to counsel for the respondent. The report may be transmitted to medical experts hired by the respondent, solely for the purposes of the present case.\nPierre Deschamps\nQU\u00c9BEC, Quebec October 30, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1047\/2805\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMicheline Montreuil v.

None of the decisions it submitted deal with the exclusion of expert witnesses.\n[4] For the Commission, there is no reason to make this distinction; the only relevant one is that between a witness that is a party and one that is not.\n[5] The Commission notes that one of the expert reports that the respondent will produce was co-signed by three of the experts the respondent plans on calling to testify. It claims that if the respondent's witnesses are present during the cross-examination of one of the others, it will be prejudicial to its cross-examination.\n[6] The complainant agrees with the Commission's position regarding the exclusion of the respondent's expert witnesses.\n[7] The respondent objects to the exclusion of its expert witnesses during the hearing.\n[8] Among the decisions cited by the respondent in support of its position, is the decision by the Court of Appeal of Qu\u00e9bec, Montpetit v. L\u00e9ger [1999] J.Q. No. 1216. In this case, the trial judge had ordered the exclusion of the defendant's expert witnesses during the cross-examination of one of them by counsel for the applicant.\n[9] In its decision, the Court of Appeal was to make a very clear distinction between ordinary witnesses and expert witnesses, stating the opinion that, following the case law, excluding ordinary witnesses was the rule while excluding expert witnesses, even partially, was the exception that could only be legally justified in exceptional circumstances.\n[10] The Tribunal is of the view that the mere fact that the respondent's experts co-signed the joint report does not create exceptional circumstances that justify waiving the rule that expert witnesses can be present during a hearing.\n[11] As the Court of Appeal of Qu\u00e9bec stated in Montpetit v. L\u00e9ger, it is possible that the complainant and the Commission may suffer prejudice because of the presence of these experts during the cross-examination of one of them. However, as the Court of Appeal stated, [translation] the trial judge will be able to draw any adverse conclusions regarding their credibility, if applicable.\n[12] Hence, the Tribunal dismisses the Commission's motion. The respondent's expert witnesses may be present during all of the testimony by the complainant and the Commission's expert, as well as during the testimony of their expert colleagues when they are called as witnesses. The Commission's expert may also be present during the testimony of the complainant, as well as during the testimony of the respondent's expert witnesses.\nPierre Deschamps\nQU\u00c9BEC, Quebec\nNovember 2, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1047\/2805\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMicheline Montreuil v.

POSITION OF THE PARTIES\nA. The complainant\nB. The Canadian Human Rights Commission\nC. The respondent\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. Documents found on an Internet site\nB. Medical literature\nIII. CONCLUSION\nIV. ORDER\n[1] On October 11, 2006, the Human Rights Commission, hereinafter called the Commission, and the complainant received a series of six volumes of documents for a total of more than 1,500 pages from the Canadian Armed Forces, hereinafter, the respondent.\n[2] On October 13, 2006, the complainant and the Commission presented the Tribunal with a motion to adjourn the hearing that was to begin October 23, 2006, claiming the late disclosure of the documents described above.\n[3] My colleague, Karen Jensen, was first presented with the motion. In a decision rendered October 16, 2006, she referred the motion back to the member assigned to hear the complaint on merits.\n[4] On October 23, 2006, the date set for the hearing on the merits, the Tribunal heard the motion to adjourn as well as many other motions and requests by the parties.\n[5] The first nine days of the hearing on the merits were devoted to hearing the various motions and requests made by the parties.\n[6] The hearing was finally adjourned on November 2, 2006, to December 4, 2006, when the complainant was to present its evidence. This decision summarizes the reasons on which the Tribunal based its decision to adjourn the hearing to December 4, 2006.\nI. POSITION OF THE PARTIES A. The complainant [7] The complainant claims that many of the documents that were transmitted to her on October 11, 2006, are new, in that they were never brought to her attention during the disclosure of evidence process.\n[8] The complainant also claims that this is the first time she is seeing at least 95% of the volume on the Canadian Forces recruiting standards and the volume on the Canadian Armed Forces medical standards. The same goes for the scientific literature on transsexualism and the interpretation of MMPI-2 psychometric tests.\n[9] The complainant claims that by transmitting voluminous documentation that she is seeing for the first time at this stage in the proceedings, the respondent did not meet its ongoing obligation to disclose all documents relevant to the issues in question. According to the complainant, this documentation should have been transmitted before February 7, 2006. In short, the complainant claims that the disclosure of these documents is late.\nB. The Canadian Human Rights Commission [10] The Commission agrees with the complainant's position. For the Commission, this is a case of a massive, very late disclosure of documents. For the Commission, this massive, very late disclosure of documents the respondent plans on using as evidence causes a serious prejudice to the complainant and the Commission, that must read the documents in order to adequately prepare for the hearing.\n[11] The Commission claims it is false to claim, as counsel for the respondent did, that by transmitting six volumes of documentation on October 11, 2006, the respondent was only conforming to the Tribunal's order of September 18 and 22, 2006, and states that such a claim does not make sense. It claims that the Tribunal would not have authorized the disclosure of new documents one week and two days before the start of the hearing.\nC. The respondent [12] The respondent claims that the disclosure respects the February 7, 2006, order by Karen Jensen on all points, and that is was only conforming to the Tribunal's order dated September 18 and 21, 2006. It also claims that the disclosure was validly authorized by the Tribunal.\n[13] Counsel for the respondent feels that the documents submitted on October 11, 2006, do not constitute a late filing, and should not have taken the Commission and the complainant by surprise.\n[14] As for the documents on the recruitment and medical standards of the Canadian Armed Forces, the respondent points out that these documents are available on its Internet site. As for the medical literature, the respondent claims that the Commission's expert should have been aware of it.\n[15] At the hearing, counsel for the respondent stated that the documents transmitted to the complainant and the Commission on October 11, 2006 replaced the documents previously disclosed and were, in fact, the documentary basis to be used in support of its evidence.\nII. ANALYSIS [16] At the hearing of this motion, the Tribunal was able to examine the documents transmitted by the respondent to the Commission and the complainant on October 11, 2006. The documentation, distributed in six spiral notebooks, is, in fact, more than 1,500 pages. Many of the documents transmitted had not previously been disclosed.\n[17] In a given case, the disclosure to the opposing party of documents that are relevant to the issue in question that a party has in its possession and the production by a party of documentation it plans on submitting in support of its evidence are two very different things.\n[18] Disclosure refers to any document a party has in its possession that it feels is relevant to prove its case. The documents produced at the hearing by a party to prove its case are, in most cases, a selection of relevant documents from the documents already disclosed.\n[19] In this case, it cannot be claimed that the Tribunal authorized the disclosure of new documents less than 10 days before the start of the hearing. The reading of the transcript of the stenographer's notes regarding the hearings of September 18 and 21, 2006 does not allow for such a conclusion to be reached.\n[20] This being said, in a particular case, not only should a party not be taken by surprise, but that party must also be allowed to prepare adequately. This applies particularly to expert witnesses who are to inform the Tribunal of technical aspects that are beyond its field of legal knowledge.\n[21] Transmitting a significant volume of documents that had not previously been disclosed to a party a few days before the start of a hearing is a cause of prejudice to the party to whom the documents were transmitted; it could prevent the party from preparing adequately and prevent its expert witnesses from preparing adequately.\n[22] Among the documents transmitted to the complainant and the Commission on October 11, 2006, two series of documents warrant particular attention: the documents that can be found on the respondent's Internet site and the scientific literature produced.\nA. Documents found on an Internet site [23] The fact that documents are available and accessible on a party's Internet site, in this case, the respondent, should not be interpreted as implicit disclosure of their content to the opposing party.\n[24] It is the responsibility of the party that has documents on its Internet site to not only inform the opposing party of the documents it considers relevant to the issues in question but also to send it copies.\n[25] The volume of documents available today on so many Internet sites is such that it is not possible to have a party find out which documents on the Internet site of another party may be relevant to the issues in question in a particular case. This task is the responsibility of the party that has such a site.\nB. Medical literature [26] In a given case, it is important for an expert to have prior access to the relevant scientific documentation to which a party plans on referring, in order to properly inform the Tribunal of technical or scientific issues. To assume that an expert should be aware of all this documentation does not seem reasonable.\n[27] Therefore, the fact that medical literature is now available on the Internet does not exempt a party, that considers certain scientific articles relevant to the issues in question and plans on using them in support of its evidence, from disclosing these articles to the opposing party as soon as possible.\n[28] In this case, there seems to have been confusion or a misconception by the respondent between the disclosure of relevant documents relate to the case and the production of documents it intends to tender in evidence. This should not be prejudicial to the complainant and the Commission.\n[29] At the hearing on the motion, the complainant stated many times that she needs some time to read all the documentation transmitted by the respondent on October 11, 2006. The Tribunal set the date of November 24 for the filing of the reply by the complainant and the Commission to the respondent's statement of particulars.\n[30] In this case, the Tribunal considers that the complainant and the Commission had six weeks to examine the documentation submitted by the respondent. Of course, during this period, nine days were devoted to the hearing of various motions and requests.\n[31] This being said, as of November 2, 2006, the complainant and the Commission had a little more than three weeks to examine the documentation submitted by the respondent on October 11, 2006, and present a reply, which, given the circumstances in this case, would constitute a deadline that could not be considered a miscarriage of justice.\nIII. CONCLUSION [32] The Tribunal finds that the request for an adjournment by the complainant and the Commission was, in this case, fully justified, considering the scope and importance of the new documents sent to them on October 11, 2006.\n[33] Starting the hearing of witnesses on October 23, 2006, would, in this case, have caused serious prejudice to both the complainant and the Commission. They should have a sufficient period of time to examine the new documents that were sent to them by the respondent on October 11, 2006, and to prepare accordingly.\nIV. ORDER [34] For the above-mentioned reasons, the Tribunal allows in part the motion for adjournment presented by the complainant and the Commission, and orders the following:\nThe hearing of witnesses in this case is differed to December 4, 2006, when the complainant will begin its evidence;\nThe respondent shall send the complainant and the Commission any additions to its expert reports on or before November 10, 2006;\nThe Commission shall send the complainant and the respondent any additions to Dr. Beltrami's report on or before November 21, 2006, as well as all related documentation;\nThe Commission shall send the respondent and the complainant the result of the MMPI-2 test in Dr. Beltrami's possession on or by November 21, 2006, including the graph and responses to the questions;\nThe complainant and the Commission shall send the respondent their reply to the respondent's statement of particulars on or before November 24, 2006, as well as all related documentation.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario December 1, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1047\/2805\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMicheline Montreuil v.

Hadjis Date: December 6, 2006 Citation: 2006 CHRT 58\n[1] Mr. Lemire has made a motion seeking the dismissal of the complaint. He alleges that the Statements of Particulars of the Canadian Human Rights Commission and Mr. Warman do not set out material facts sufficient to allow him to give full answer and defence.\n[2] This is not my first decision regarding particulars in this case. On August 16, 2006, I issued a ruling ordering Mr. Warman and the Commission to identify the specific messages that they allege constitute hate messages, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act (Warman v. Lemire, 2006 CHRT 32). I noted, at paragraph 26 of the decision, that if the Commission and Mr. Warman take the position that each message found on each of the freedomsite.org website\u2019s pages constitutes a hate message, then they should indicate so explicitly.\n[3] Pursuant to this ruling, the Commission sent a letter to Mr. Lemire\u2019s legal counsel, on October 2, 2006, stating its position to the effect that all of the messages contained in the Freedom site disclosed to [Mr. Lemire] in paper copy and also on C-Rom [sic] version constitute hate messages contrary to s. 13 of the Act. The Commission added that while it will be arguing at the hearing that some postings on the website may be more explicit than others in constituting violations of s. 13, given that the website has only one common theme, the Commission will be asking the Tribunal for an order that the entire website be closed. The Commission added that it would therefore be relying on the evidence of the entire website\u2019s contents in order to enable the Tribunal to fully and completely assess the very nature of the website in its entirety, not just certain aspects of it.\n[4] Similarly, on October 2, 2006, Mr. Warman sent a letter detailing the evidence upon which he intended to rely, namely the entirety of the Freedomsite message board; all other examples identified in [Mr. Warman\u2019s] complaint; the entirety of the contents of jrbooksonline; and Mr. Lemire\u2019s posting of the Canadian Immigrant Poem to Stormfront.\n[5] Mr. Lemire claims that the details provided in the Commission\u2019s and Mr. Warman\u2019s responses are insufficient and are not in compliance with my previous ruling. According to Mr. Lemire, these circumstances render it impossible for him to mount a defence as he does not know the case against him so that he may defend against it.\n[6] I disagree. The Commission and Mr. Warman have now explicitly stated that in their opinion, the entire freedomsite.org website constitutes matter that is in violation of s. 13 of the Act. Prior to this particularization, the Commission and Mr. Warman had simply produced 133 pages of messages as part of their documentary disclosure, without specifying which of those messages they allege constitute hate messages under the Act. The Commission and Mr. Warman have now specified that they consider each of these messages to be in violation of s. 13. These are just their allegations. It is incumbent upon them to prove these allegations at the hearing.\n[7] Mr. Lemire seems to argue in his motion that all of the messages do not constitute hate messages under the Act, and that there is no justification for the issuance of a Tribunal order shutting down the website. The appropriate time for these arguments to be raised, however, is in final submissions. These arguments have no bearing on the issue of particulars.\n[8] Mr. Warman makes reference in his October 2nd letter to jrbooksonline and an alleged posting by Mr. Lemire on another website. Mr. Warman notes that this material was previously disclosed. Mr. Lemire claims that, as of the date of his motion, the Commission and Mr. Warman had not provided him with copies of the entire freedomsite.org website (its message board, in particular), nor of jrbooksonline, as part of their disclosure. Mr. Lemire argues that given the intention of Mr. Warman and the Commission to rely on evidence from the entire freedomsite.org and jrbooksonline websites, this omission constitutes a breach of the Commission\u2019s and Mr. Warman\u2019s duty to disclose. More importantly, it impairs Mr. Lemire\u2019s ability to mount a defence to the allegations made against him.\n[9] According to Rule 6 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, a party is only required to disclose documents in the party\u2019s possession that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief identified by any of the parties to the case. This duty to disclose does not preclude a party from alleging facts and issues which are supported by evidence adduced from documents in the possession of another party. Indeed, it is not uncommon in human rights cases for discriminatory practices to be established from evidence that was in the possession of the respondent and disclosed as part of the Tribunal\u2019s disclosure process (see for e.g. Montreuil v. National Bank of Canada, (2004), 48 C.H.R.R. 436 (C.H.R.T.)).\n[10] In the present case, if a website in question, such as freedomsite.org, is indeed owned by Mr. Lemire, as alleged by Mr. Warman, it strikes me as somewhat disingenuous for Mr. Lemire to argue that the Commission\u2019s failure to provide him copies of its content would constitute unfair treatment. It would seem to me that Mr. Lemire would be the person who is best placed to have knowledge of the website\u2019s content.\n[11] In any event, Rule 9 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure is available to address any question that may arise if a party tries to enter into evidence a document that was not previously disclosed.\n[12] Finally, I note that in his submissions, Mr. Lemire indicates that the jrbooksonline material consists of literally tens of thousands of pages. This, I suspect, is a reference to the literature that I ordered Mr. Lemire to allow the Commission and Mr. Warman to view in my most recent ruling, Warman v. Lemire, 2006 CHRT 53. To forestall the possibility of anyone being taken by surprise, I order the Commission and Mr. Warman to inform Mr. Lemire which portions of this literature they intend to specifically draw the Tribunal\u2019s attention to at the hearing. This notice must be provided to Mr. Lemire within one week following the viewing of the literature, as ordered in paragraph 11 of that decision.\n[13] For all the above reasons, Mr. Lemire\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

ORDER\n[1] Ms. Sandy Lipp (n\u00e9e Culic, hereinafter referred to as Ms. Lipp) began her employment with Canada Post in 1990 as a temporary employee. In 1993, she became a part-time postal clerk in Regina, Saskatchewan. From 1994 or 1995 on, Ms. Lipp experienced health problems that necessitated workplace accommodation.\n[2] Then, in 2001, Ms. Lipp was diagnosed with major depression and an anxiety disorder that was, to some extent, related to conflicts with her supervisor at Canada Post. She was off work for a number of months. During that time, Ms. Lipp became pregnant.\n[3] In the Fall of 2001, Ms. Lipp attempted to return to work, but was told by Canada Post that more medical information was needed before she could return. The Corporation was apparently concerned that Ms. Lipp had not sufficiently recovered from her depression and anxiety disorder to allow her to return to work. It was suspected that Ms. Lipp might be willing to disregard her psychological problems in order to log in the required number of hours to qualify for Employment Insurance during her maternity leave.\n[4] The Corporation was not satisfied with the information provided by Ms. Lipp's physician attesting to her fitness to return to work. Therefore, in November of 2001, Canada Post arranged for Ms. Lipp to attend a two-day independent medical examination (IME) with physicians in Winnipeg. Ms. Lipp indicated that she could not travel to Winnipeg for a number of reasons including difficulties with her pregnancy and a great fear of traveling.\n[5] Canada Post was prepared to fly Ms. Lipp to Winnipeg, to pay for a bus trip, or to rent a car and pay for Ms. Lipp and her boyfriend to attend the IME. However, Canada Post was not prepared to lift the requirement that she attend the IME in Winnipeg and warned Ms. Lipp that if she did not attend she would be placed on disciplinary leave without pay.\n[6] Ms. Lipp did not attend the IME on November 22 and 23, 2001. Consequently, she was placed on disciplinary leave without pay until such time as Canada Post received the results of an IME concerning her fitness to return to work.\n[7] Through her union, Ms. Lipp filed grievances on November 7 and December 19, 2001 asserting that Canada Post had violated the collective agreement by engaging in an unreasonable delay in returning her to the workplace and in putting her on disciplinary leave without pay.\n[8] On April 16, 2004, an arbitrator dismissed Ms. Lipp's grievances. The arbitrator held that Canada Post was justified in requiring Ms. Lipp to attend the IME in order to determine her fitness to return to work. Therefore, the arbitrator rejected the assertion that there had been unreasonable delay in returning her to work. With respect to the second grievance, the arbitrator held that given Ms. Lipp's defiant stance regarding the IME, the imposition of disciplinary leave without pay was justified.\n[9] On March 18, 2003, Ms. Lipp filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in which she alleged discrimination on the basis of sex (pregnancy) and disability (shoulder and neck injuries, fibromyalgia). The allegedly discriminatory conduct includes Canada Post's refusal to return Ms. Lipp to her former position in October 2001, the requirement that she attend an IME in Winnipeg, the way that the meeting with the Plant Manager was handled, the disciplinary action taken against her when she refused to attend the IME in Winnipeg, and other aspects of Canada Post's treatment of Ms. Lipp from October 2001 and ongoing.\n[10] The complaint was referred to the Tribunal on September 28, 2005. Canada Post subsequently brought a motion requesting that the complaint be dismissed on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata.\nI. ISSUE [11] The sole issue to be determined in this case is whether the doctrine of res judicata or abuse of process apply to the present complaint.\n[12] I find that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply in the circumstances of the present case. It is far from clear that the issues in the complaint have been determined by the arbitrator. For this reason also, it would not be an abuse of process for the Tribunal to hear the complaint. Therefore, this is not a case where it would be appropriate to dismiss the complaint on the basis of either doctrine.\nII. ANALYSIS Res Judicata\n[13] The doctrine of res judicata is a legal tool used to bring finality and closure to litigation. It is a means of ensuring that once a final decision has been rendered, the same issues between the same parties are not relitigated in another forum. (Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460)\n[14] However, caution and restraint must be used in the application of the doctrine of res judicata to the adjudication of human rights complaints, since the dismissal of a complaint results in a denial of the opportunity to be heard (Cremasco v. Canada Post Corporation 2002\/09\/30 - Ruling No. 1, at para. 83, aff'd 2004 FCA 363, and Buffet v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) 2005 CHRT 16 at para. 40). For this reason, it has been said that a complaint should only be dismissed on the basis of res judicata in the very clearest of circumstances (Cremasco, supra, at para. 106).\n[15] There are two principal branches of the doctrine. The first branch is known as issue estoppel. Issue estoppel applies where there are common issues in the two proceedings. Depending on the nature of the issue in respect of which the estoppel is being raised, issue estoppel may bar relitigation of only a discrete issue or it may bar the second action in its entirety (Hough v. Brunswick Centres Inc., (1997) 9 C.P.C. (4th) 111 (Ont. Gen. Div.) at paras. 24 and 25).\n[16] The second branch of res judicata is known as cause of action estoppel. In the present case, the parties have not argued that cause of action estoppel applies. Therefore, I will confine my analysis to the application of issue estoppel.\nA. Issue Estoppel: The Test [17] The two-part test for the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel is now well-known: (1) the criteria for issue estoppel must be met; and (2) if the criteria are met, the Tribunal must determine, based on certain discretionary factors, whether it is appropriate, in the circumstances, to apply the doctrine (Danyluk, supra, at para. 33).\n[18] The criteria to be met for the application of issue estoppel are as follows:\nthe same questions are being decided in both proceedings; the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel is a final decision; and the parties, or their privies, are the same.\n(i) Same Questions in Both Proceedings [19] For this requirement to be met, the determination of the issue in the first litigation must have been necessary to the result (Minott v. O'Shanter Development Co. (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 (O.C.A.) at para. 23). In other words, issue estoppel covers fundamental issues determined in the first proceeding, issues that were essential to the decision.\n[20] This aspect of the test requires careful analysis, in my view. While it is not necessary that the adjudicator employ the same methodology and terminology that would be used by the Tribunal, it must be clear that the adjudicator has dealt with the human rights issues in the case (Rasanen v. Rosemount Instruments Ltd. (1994), 112 D.L.R. (4th) 683 at p. 703). Human rights are quasi-constitutional rights. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that no one be denied the opportunity to ensure that these rights have been respected (Cremasco, supra, at para. 83, and Buffet, supra, at para. 40).\n[21] In her complaint, Ms. Lipp alleges that Canada Post has discriminated against her on the basis of disability (shoulder and neck injuries as well as fibromyalgia) and sex (pregnancy). Ms. Lipp alleges that the way that Canada Post handled the process of investigating her fitness to return to work was discriminatory; she was treated differently during this process because she was pregnant and\/or disabled.\n[22] In contrast, the two grievances which were the subject of the arbitration proceedings do not specifically allege discrimination. In her grievances, Ms. Lipp was asserting her right, pursuant to the collective agreement, to return to her modified duties once she had established that she was psychologically fit. Thus, the focus of the arbitration proceedings was different from the human rights complaint; Ms. Lipp's fitness to return to work and Canada Post's justification for demanding further proof of her fitness were the issues in the arbitration proceedings.\n[23] Canada Post argues that even though the arbitrator did not engage in a human rights analysis per se, nor did he mention the words discrimination or accommodation, his essential findings and conclusions are, nonetheless, determinative of the issues in Ms. Lipp's complaint.\n[24] What were the arbitrator's essential findings? The arbitrator found that Ms. Lipp's request to return to her former duties was probably more motivated by a desire to qualify for Employment Insurance than a true improvement in her psychological health. He held that Canada Post had a right to know whether Ms. Lipp was, in fact, fit to return to her former duties. Given Canada Post's lack of confidence in Ms. Lipp's physicians' reports, the arbitrator held that an IME was justified.\n[25] The arbitrator held that Canada Post was justified in requiring that Ms. Lipp attend the IME in Winnipeg. He noted that Canada Post's physician was of the view that the only option for an IME was in Winnipeg. He also noted that Canada Post had offered Ms. Lipp a number of travel alternatives.\n[26] The arbitrator implicitly found that the events which were alleged to be part of the delay were necessary steps in the process of obtaining the information that Canada Post needed. Therefore, he held that Canada Post did not engage in unnecessary delay in returning Ms. Lipp to her former position.\n[27] With regard to the second grievance, the arbitrator held that Ms. Lipp was warned that if she refused to attend the IME in Winnipeg she would be placed on disciplinary leave without pay. He stated that any vagueness in the letter to Ms. Lipp explaining why an IME was necessary was attributable to requirements designed to protect Ms. Lipp's privacy. Therefore, the arbitrator held that Canada Post was justified in placing Ms. Lipp on disciplinary leave without pay.\n[28] Are these conclusions and findings determinative of the issues that arise in Ms. Lipp's complaint? In a complaint of this nature, the Tribunal will consider whether Ms. Lipp was treated differently from other employees and whether this different treatment was based, at least in part, on the fact that she was disabled or pregnant or both. To succeed, a complainant need only show that the ground alleged was a factor in the respondent's conduct; it does not need to be the sole or overriding factor: Martin v. Carter Chevrolet Oldsmobile, 2001 BCHRT 37 at para. 21; Cooke v. Vancouver Island Aids Society (1999), 35 C.H.R.R. D\/56 at para. 52 (B.C.H.R.T.); and Holden v. Canadian National Railway (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para. 7 (F.C.A.).\n[29] The Tribunal will then examine whether Canada Post has provided a credible, non-discriminatory explanation for its conduct. The evidence will be looked at as a whole, not as discrete events in isolation of one another.\n[30] The Tribunal may also be called upon to determine whether a requirement results in adverse effect discrimination or indirect discrimination. If the effect of an apparently non-discriminatory requirement is to impose a heavier burden on an employee or to deprive an employee of a benefit by reason of their disability and\/or sex, then unless the requirement is a bona fide occupational requirement, it will be found to be discriminatory. The key factor in determining whether a requirement is a bona fide occupational requirement is whether the employer has accommodated the employee to the point of undue hardship. (See: British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 49; and Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General) [2002] 4 S.C.R. 429 at para. 120) Employee participation in the accommodation efforts is also an important factor in the Tribunal's analysis.\n[31] Can it be said that the arbitrator's decision addressed these issues either expressly or by necessary implication? For the following reasons, the answer to this question is no.\n[32] Firstly, the arbitrator did not examine whether Ms. Lipp was treated differently on the basis of her pregnancy and\/or disability. Although he found that Ms. Lipp was probably seeking to return to work because she was pregnant and needed the money, he stopped short of analyzing whether this fact, as well as Ms. Lipp's disabilities, might have influenced the way Canada Post handled the investigation of her return to work and the requirement that she attend an IME in Winnipeg. The arbitrator did not ask whether, looking at the whole process, Ms. Lipp was treated differently than other employees because, at least in part, she was disabled and pregnant. Indeed, the arbitrator was not asked to make a determination on this issue and it was not necessary to do so in order to decide whether Canada Post had engaged in undue delay in returning Ms. Lipp to her former position.\n[33] Can it be said that the arbitrator's conclusion that Canada Post did not engage in undue delay in returning Ms. Lipp to her former duties constitutes an implicit finding that Canada Post did not discriminate against Ms. Lipp? After all, in drawing this conclusion, the arbitrator explicitly rejected the union's argument that barrier after barrier had been erected to prevent Ms. Lipp's return to work. Is the rejection of this argument an implicit finding that Canada Post did not discriminate against Ms. Lipp? In my view, it is not possible to say this. The arbitrator clearly interpreted the events that occurred as steps in the process of trying to obtain more information about Ms. Lipp's psychological health. In light of that finding, the events were viewed as justifiable. However, this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the process or parts of it were not discriminatory.\n[34] In the human rights context, a complaint may be found to have merit even if discrimination is only one among a number of factors influencing the impugned conduct. Therefore, it is possible to argue that a desire to obtain more information may not have been the only factor influencing Canada Post's conduct toward Ms. Lipp; discrimination may also have played a role. In my view, there must be some indication in the arbitrator's reasons that he addressed this issue and rejected it before it can be said that the issue of discrimination had been conclusively determined. Otherwise, the possibility that discrimination played a role in the treatment of Ms. Lipp is still a live issue for the Tribunal to address during its inquiry into the complaint.\n[35] Furthermore, while the arbitrator found that Canada Post was justified, on the basis of the provisions of the collective agreement and the arbitral jurisprudence, in requiring further medical information, there is no indication that he considered whether the requirement resulted in indirect discrimination. In that regard, it might be argued that although, on the face of it, the requirement of traveling to Winnipeg for an IME makes sense for the reasons set out by the arbitrator, it is, nonetheless, discriminatory in its effect since it imposed a greater burden on Ms. Lipp than it would on other employees because she was pregnant. It does not appear that the arbitrator considered the possibility of adverse effect discrimination.\n[36] The next step in the human rights analysis would be to examine whether Canada Post had an obligation to accommodate Ms. Lipp's pregnancy and if so, whether it had done so to the point of undue hardship. There is no indication that the arbitrator examined whether, for example, in requiring that Ms. Lipp attend an IME in Winnipeg, Canada Post was required to accommodate Ms. Lipp's pregnancy. He noted that several travel alternatives had been proposed for attending the IME in Winnipeg and that the plant manager rejected the union's suggestion that the Winnipeg psychiatrist be flown into Regina. However, it is not clear whether these options were proposed as a way of dealing with Ms. Lipp's fear of traveling or her pregnancy-related difficulties. In my view, the arbitrator did not address the issue of accommodation either explicitly or by necessary implication.\n[37] Finally, Canada Post has argued that the arbitrator's finding that an IME was needed before the accommodation process could be engaged, is exactly the same issue that the Tribunal would face in the adjudication of Ms. Lipp's complaint. Indeed, Canada Post goes so far as to argue that had the arbitrator not found that an IME was warranted, he would have found that Canada Post had failed its obligation to accommodate Ms. Lipp. Therefore, the finding that the IME was justified precludes any analysis that the Tribunal might undertake.\n[38] I disagree. In her complaint, Ms. Lipp has not alleged that Canada Post failed to accommodate her depression and anxiety disorder. She has alleged discrimination on the basis of sex (pregnancy) and her shoulder, neck and fibromyalgia-related disabilities. As such, the arbitrator's finding that the IME was necessary does not preclude an analysis of whether the alleged discrimination occurred or not.\n[39] In my view, it is speculative to say that had the arbitrator found that the IME was not necessary, he would have found that Canada Post had failed its obligation to accommodate Ms. Lipp. There is no indication in the arbitrator's reasons, nor does it follow by necessary implication from his conclusions, that he would have made any finding at all with respect to the duty to accommodate Ms. Lipp. In her grievance, Ms. Lipp was asserting that she was fit to return to her modified duties. She was not claiming that she needed accommodation on the basis of her psychological problems. Had the arbitrator found that the IME was not justified, he would presumably have ordered that she be returned to her former duties and compensated for lost wages. I do not think it is possible, based on the arbitrator's analysis, to speculate on any other conclusions that he might have drawn.\n[40] For these reasons, I think that this is not a case where, although the terminology and methodology may be different, the human rights issues have been covered in some way by the arbitrator. In my view, the arbitrator was not called upon to determine whether Canada Post's conduct toward Ms. Lipp was discriminatory. The question was whether Canada Post had engaged in undue delay and whether the disciplinary action was justifiable. These are different questions from those that the Tribunal would be called upon to consider. Nor can it be said that any of the issues raised in Ms. Lipp's human rights complaint were decided by necessary implication in the arbitration. Therefore, this aspect of the test has not been met.\nIII. CONCLUSION regarding res judicata [41] The doctrine of res judicata will not apply unless all three criteria have been met. Therefore, given my finding that the first criterion has not been met, it is not necessary for me to consider the second and third elements of the test. Moreover, a consideration of the discretionary factors for the application of the doctrine is also unnecessary.\nA. Abuse of Process [42] Canada Post has also argued that it would be an abuse of process to allow the matter to be heard by this Tribunal since the arbitrator has conclusively determined the very issues that would be dealt with by the Tribunal. Canada Post states that Ms. Lipp is seeking to have the Tribunal reach a different conclusion from the one reached by the arbritrator and this is clearly an abuse of process.\n[43] However, for the reasons that I have provided above, a hearing before this Tribunal would not constitute a rehearing of the same issues that were determined by the arbritator. Therefore, I find that it would not be an abuse of process for the Tribunal to hear this complaint.\nIV.

The Complainant, Richard Warman, claims to have viewed the website on a computer in Ottawa, where he resides. Mr. Lemire lives somewhere in or near Oakville, Ontario, in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). His exact address was not disclosed by his legal counsel in her submissions. The freedomsite.org website has a postal address that is located in Toronto.\n[3] Thus, Mr. Lemire, a resident of the GTA, is alleged to have operated a website, which was also based in Toronto, through which hate messages were communicated. The nature of the Internet is such that the material could have been viewed from Ottawa or just about any other spot on the globe. In my view, however, the place most closely linked to the alleged discriminatory conduct is the GTA.\n[4] Mr. Warman suggested conducting the hearing at some point midway between Ottawa and Toronto, such as Kingston. I fail to see the logic in this proposal. At a distance of several hours from both Ottawa and Toronto, such a location would not be convenient to anyone and has no rational connection to the place where the alleged discrimination took place.\n[5] I find that the most appropriate venue for this case is Toronto. Mr. Warman submits that if the hearing is to be held in Toronto, he would prefer that the location chosen be situated in the downtown area. His travel expenses would be reduced since he has personal access to lower accommodation costs, and public transit is more readily available to him. This is a reasonable request in my opinion.\n[6] Mr. Lemire has expressed a preference for the Oakville\/Mississauga\/Etobicoke area, at the western end of the GTA. He needs to be able to pick up his child from day care. He also claims that he fears intimidation and harassment from certain groups if the hearing takes place in downtown Toronto. I am certain Mr. Lemire can be accommodated on both fronts. The hearing schedule could be adjusted to allow enough time for him to pick up his child, if needed. The parties can also rest assured that any disturbance or intimidation, inside or outside the hearing room, will not be tolerated by the Tribunal, and appropriate measures will be taken to deal with any problem that may arise.\n[7] Having considered all of the parties' submissions, I direct that the hearing into this complaint be conducted in central or downtown Toronto. The exact address is to be determined and will be communicated to the parties by the Tribunal at a later time.\nsigned by\nAthanasios Hadjis\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nFebruary 22, 2006\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1073\/5405\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRichard Warman v.

Hadjis\n[1] Several groups have applied to the Tribunal seeking leave to appear as interested parties at the inquiry into this complaint.\n[2] Richard Warman filed the complaint in November 2003. He alleged that the respondent, Marc Lemire, had communicated hate messages through an Internet website, contrary to s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Canadian Human Rights Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry on August 24, 2005.\n[3] On October 24, 2005, the Tribunal held a case management meeting by conference call with the parties. Mr. Lemire's counsel, Barbara Kulaszka, indicated during the meeting that she intended to present a preliminary motion regarding the constitutionality of s. 13 of the Act. The Tribunal set down dates for Ms. Kulaszka to file her motion and for the other parties to respond.\n[4] On November 29, 2005, Paul Fromm, acting for the Canadian Association for Free Expression Inc. (CAFE), sent a letter to the Tribunal seeking leave to obtain standing as an interested party making written and oral submissions in support of [Mr. Lemire's] motion.\n[5] On December 12 and 19, 2005, Douglas H. Christie communicated in writing with the Tribunal, on behalf of the Canadian Free Speech League (CFSL). He advised that the CFSL was seeking standing in the present case, as an interested party making written and oral submissions on the motion put forth by Marc Lemire regarding the constitutionality of s. 13 [and s. 54] of the Act.\n[6] On December 13, 2005, Marvin Kurz, solicitor for the League of Human Rights of B'Nai Brith Canada, writing on behalf of counsel for the Canadian Jewish Congress and the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies, advised the Tribunal that the three organizations (the B'Nai Brith Group) were seeking interested party status to jointly participate in opposing Mr. Lemire's motion regarding the constitutionality of s. 13 of the Act.\n[7] On December 19, 2005, the Tribunal directed that Mr. Lemire's motion would be dealt with in the course of the hearing into the complaint, and no longer as a preliminary matter.\n[8] All three groups seeking interested party status have informed the Tribunal that they still wish to participate in this case, but to varying degrees.\nCAFE [9] CAFE wishes to participate throughout the course of the hearing. Mr. Fromm indicated that CAFE seeks full participatory rights to make oral and written arguments, to present written evidence, to call [...] and cross-examine witnesses.\n[10] CAFE states that it is a non-profit organization, which is dedicated to promoting and maximising the guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly, under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Since this proceeding raises important issues regarding these values, CAFE contends that it can bring a unique expertise regarding the effects of the Act's hate message provisions on the Charter.\n[11] CAFE publishes a regular newsletter that explores threats to free speech, conducts meetings on free speech related issues, and makes representations to legislative bodies on these matters. Mr. Fromm claims that the organization has about 2,000 supporters and subscribers across Canada.\nThe B'Nai Brith Group [12] The members of the B'Nai Brith Group seek to be added as interested parties for the full proceeding, but undertake to limit their participation to the Charter issues. They also undertake to act jointly throughout the proceedings and file one set of submissions. They will coordinate their efforts with Mr. Warman and the Commission to ensure that there is no duplication in the evidence or submissions.\n[13] Mr. Kurz explains in his application that his clients are three major Canadian Jewish human rights organizations. He claims that they have an extensive history of participation as intervenors in Charter litigation regarding hate propaganda, free speech and the determination of reasonable limits of hate propaganda.\n[14] As representatives of a group of persons who have a long history of being subject to hatred and vilification, the three organizations making up the B'Nai Brith Group argue that they will bring to bear a unique experience and perspective, which will permit them to make helpful submissions that differ from those of the Commission and Mr. Warman.\nThe CFSL [15] The CFSL wishes to simply argue the constitutional issue regarding s. 13 of the Act. It does not propose to call or cross-examine any witnesses.\n[16] Mr. Christie claims that the CFSL exists to defend freedom of speech in Canada and to provide counsel and assistance to those who have had their free speech rights assailed by government. He has appeared as general counsel for the CFSL in a number of cases before courts and quasi-judicial tribunals, as an advocate for free speech. In his view, the CFSL's perspective and experience may be of assistance to the Tribunal in considering Mr. Lemire's motion.\n[17] Incidentally, on February 3, 2006, the Tribunal was informed that the Attorney General of Canada would be exercising the right, pursuant to s. 57 of the Federal Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, to participate and adduce evidence at the hearing, as well as to make submissions, in respect of the constitutional question.\nAnalysis [18] Section 50 of the Act gives the Tribunal wide discretion with respect to the granting of interested party status (Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service), [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 15 at para. 22 (C.H.R.T.) (QL)). The onus is on an applicant to demonstrate how its expertise would be of assistance in the determination of the issues before the Tribunal. Interested party status will not be granted if it does not add significantly to the legal positions of the parties representing a similar viewpoint (Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 14 at para. 6 (C.H.R.T.) (QL).\n[19] Based on the material and arguments presented, I am satisfied that all of the applicants can add significantly to the legal positions of the parties regarding the constitutionality of s. 13. It is obvious, however, that their interest in this case is limited to the constitutional question. None of the applicants sought to intervene in the case prior to this issue being raised by Ms. Kulaszka as a preliminary matter. The parties to the complaint had been instructed to address the question by written submissions. The Tribunal left the door open to the possibility of receiving oral submissions at a later time, if needed. For as long as it appeared that the question was going to be dealt with as a preliminary matter, the three applicants seemed satisfied to restrict their input to the constitutional issue only.\n[20] The applicants (the Canadian Association for Free Expression Inc., and the Canadian Free Speech League, as well as the group comprised jointly of the League of Human Rights of B'Nai Brith Canada, the Canadian Jewish Congress, and the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center of Holocaust Studies) are, therefore, granted interested party status in the present case, but solely with respect to the issue of the constitutionality of s. 13 and any related provisions of the Act.\n[21] The interested parties shall have the right to present evidence, cross-examine, and make submissions, relating to the constitutional issue only. They will not, however, be permitted to overlap or repeat the evidence, cross-examination, or submissions of Mr. Warman, the Commission, Mr. Lemire, or the Attorney General of Canada.\n[22] Ms. Kulaszka has raised certain concerns regarding the additional costs arising from the participation of additional parties (such as photocopying, faxing and courier costs). These matters can be addressed at the next case management meeting.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Sangha filed a complaint dated May 6, 2002 with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. He alleges that the respondent, the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board (Board) discriminated against him on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion and age by refusing to hire him for the Regulatory Officer (RO) position with the Board. He alleges that this refusal is contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nA. The Respondent Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board [2] The Board is a regulatory authority established under the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act. The primary function of the Board is to process applications for land use permits and water licences in those areas of the MacKenzie Valley in the Northwest Territories where land claim agreements have not yet been concluded, i.e. in unsettled land claim areas. The Board also processes transboundary land and water applications in the Mackenzie Valley where the application transcends the boundaries of more than one settlement area.\n[3] Some examples of activities that require a land use permit are the use of explosives greater that 50 kg; the use of vehicles greater than 5 tons; camp sites to be used for more than two hundred person days; fuel storage greater than two thousand liters; construction of buildings greater than one hundred square meters.\n[4] Activities that require a water licence include the use of water for gas and oil exploration, mining and milling, power facilities, agriculture, conservation and recreation.\nB. The Board's Advertisement for Four Regulatory Officers [5] On August 11, 2001, the Board placed an advertisement in the Vancouver Sun for four RO positions, at a salary range of $48,410 to $60,770. The position required:\nan undergraduate degree in science, environmental studies, ecology, resource management or a related field, with two years experience in a related environmental field; or a post secondary diploma in environmental management or a related field and three years experience; knowledge of environmental issues in Canada's North, especially relating to mining, and oil and gas developments; knowledge of the technology associated with the reduction of impacts caused by developments in a northern environment; operating knowledge of Microsoft Office software; experience working in remote locations; ability to write technical reports; a Class 5 drivers licence.\n[6] The RO position was for a term of three years, subject to a six month probationary period, with the possibility of a two year extension.\nC. The Functions and Responsibilities of a Regulatory Officer [7] The primary responsibility of a RO is to process land use permit and water licence applications. When the Board receives an application for a permit, it is assigned to an RO whose first task is to ensure that the application is complete. If not, the RO will contact the applicant and request further information. The RO refers to a checklist which is a step-by-step outline of the RO's duties when an application is received.\n[8] Once the application is complete, the RO sends it out for review. The Board has a distribution list of reviewers, which includes First Nations communities, the relevant Federal Government departments and departments of the Government of the North West Territories. The RO must ensure that all of the reviewers get copies of the application and have an opportunity to review and provide comments back to the RO.\n[9] After receiving the reviewers' comments, the RO synthesizes them into a staff report for consideration by the Board. The staff report includes the application details, comments of the reviewers and whether there is public concern or a potential harm for the environment.\n[10] If no concerns have been identified, the RO will so indicate in the staff report and draft the licence or permit for the Board's approval. The Board has a standard list of conditions and the relevant conditions are put in the licence. If there are concerns identified in the staff report, it is left to the Board for its decision.\n[11] ROs spend a great deal of time communicating with the applicants and the reviewers. This involves phoning, writing or emailing the applicant for more information or responding to applicants' inquiries as to the status of their application. There is a statutory time limit to review the application and issue the Board's decision. There is pressure on the RO to meet these timelines.\n[12] ROs often have to contact the reviewers numerous times, coaxing them to send in their comments so that the staff report can be prepared and sent to the Board for decision within the time period.\n[13] The ROs must have some, but not a lot, of knowledge of the technical issues in the application. More detailed technical expertise is available from the Senior RO or from outside consultants.\n[14] It is also important that an RO have some northern experience, such as understanding of the environmental issues in the north; northern living experience and some familiarity with First Nations communities.\nD. Screening the Applicants for Interview [15] The Board received 38 applications for the four RO positions. Of the 38 applicants, two had grade 12; six had diplomas; 22 with Bachelor degrees; six with Master's degrees; and two with Ph.D.s.\n[16] An Interview Committee was struck to review the applications received and decide which applicants the Board would interview. The Interview Committee consisted of Wanda Anderson, Manager of Finance and Administration; Karl Lauten, Manager of Regulatory Reviews; and Peter Lennie-Misgeld, Sr. Regulatory Officer. Each of them reviewed the applications and prepared a list of who they thought should be interviewed\n[17] The Interview Committee chose 12 applicants for interviews. It screened out all of the Grade 12 applicants; 71% of those with a diploma; 60% of those with a Bachelor's degree, and all of those with a post-graduate degree, except for Dr. Sangha. This suggests that the Board used educational credentials as screening criteria, both on the low side and on the high side.\n[18] Ms. Anderson did not select Dr. Sangha for an interview. She felt that, given his qualifications, he would likely become bored with the job fairly quickly. Karl Lauten did want to interview Dr. Sangha. He thought that Dr. Sangha might be a good fit for Technical Advisor, which position was vacant. But at that time, the Board had not considered filling the position. Mr. Lennie-Misgeld, who was the junior member on the Interview Committee, said that he deferred to Mr.Lauten in choosing Dr. Sangha to be interviewed.\n[19] Ms. Anderson testified that the Interview Committee had discussed this possibility. But she was clear in her evidence, which was not challenged, that Dr. Sangha was interviewed only for the RO position. The Technical Advisor position was never filled and was later eliminated.\n[20] Dr. Sangha testified that he was never told during the interview that he was being considered for Technical Advisor.\nE. The Interview Process [21] The interview was a structured interview in which a set of standard questions was put to each candidate interviewed. There were no questions asked by the interviewers relating to personal characteristics, such as, race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religion or age.\n[22] The questions focused on the skills of the potential candidate and the knowledge that the candidate had of the Board and its processes, the experience of the candidate, together with salary expectations and a starting date.\n[23] Each of the candidates was given a score by the interviewers. Interview notes were taken by all of the interviewers, which notes were filed at the hearing, except those of Mr. Lennie-Misgeld who had discarded all of his interview notes.\n[24] Of the twelve people interviewed for the RO position, four were offered a job. Two of those did not accept the offer and the Board made two more offers which were accepted.\n[25] Dr. Sangha was not made an offer. Ms. Anderson advised him by email on September 17, 2001 that the four RO positions had been offered to other candidates.\n(i) Profile of Dr. Sangha [26] Dr. Sangha's educational qualifications are: B.Sc., Agriculture (Punjab University, India, 1972); M.Sc., Landscape Planning (Technical University of Berlin, Germany 1983); Ph.D., Environmental Science (Technical University of Berlin, 1983); Certificate in Project Planning & Management (Technical University of Berlin, Germany 1989).\n[27] He is fluent in German, Punjabi, Hindi and English. He has co-authored two books and has written a number of research papers in the environmental field.\n[28] Dr. Sangha has a varied work experience. During the course of his studies in Germany, Dr. Sangha worked for the German Federal government as an environmental scientist dealing with various environmental issues.\n[29] In 1990, Dr. Sangha assumed the position of Associate Professor at Punjab Agricultural University and remained in that position until 1996 when he came to Canada with his family. He taught courses in ecology and urban environment; land use and resources conservation; watershed conservation and management plan; environmental and impact assessment.\n[30] When he arrived in Canada, Dr. Sangha believed that there were few opportunities for a new immigrant in a Canadian university. So he applied for jobs in the environmental sciences throughout Canada. He wanted to gain Canadian experience, which hopefully would get him a permanent position in his field.\n[31] He first worked as a voluntary worker with the Langley Environmental Partners Society, in Langley, B.C. This was a community based organization whose focus was watershed restoration. He prepared a plantation scheme for wetland restoration and conservation and worked there for about five months in 1997. He was not paid and did not work full time. He did it to gain experience.\n[32] For six months in 1997-1998, Dr. Sangha worked as a Senior Research Scientist with Kam Biotechnology Ltd in Surrey, B.C. Dr. Sangha worked on a waste water remediation project.\n[33] In 1998-1999, Dr. Sangha worked for the Fraser Valley Regional District in Chilliwack, B.C. as an Environmental Promotion and Educational Development Assistant, basically dealing with waste management plans. He was sponsored in this position by HRDC in a program designed to provide work experience to recent immigrants.\n[34] From March 1999 to June 2000, Dr. Sangha worked as a production manager for the N.A.T.S. Nursery Ltd.\n[35] At this point in time, Dr. Sangha applied for university positions and was offered the position of Assistant Professor, Environmental Studies, at St. Cloud State University, Minnesota. This was a contract position from September 2000 to May 2001. When the contract ended, Dr. Sangha applied for a tenured position, but the position was not filled for budgetary reasons.\n[36] When he returned from Minnesota, Dr. Sangha worked as a landscape gardener for residential properties in and around Vancouver. It was a labour-type of job; running the lawnmower, hoeing, weeding, tending the garden. He had been doing that for about a half year, when he was involved in a car accident and was quite seriously injured. He did not return to work at that job.\n[37] In March 2004, he started work as a bookkeeper with the Gill Electric Company in Vancouver and continues in that position.\n(ii) Profiles of the Six Candidates That Were Offered RO Positions. (iii) Stephen Mathyk [38] Stephen Mathyk has a Renewable Resource Management Diploma (Lethbridge Community College, 1998); Fish and Wildlife Technology Certificate (Lethbridge Community College, 1999); and a B.Sc. in Environmental Science (University of Lethbridge, 2001).\n[39] He has four years experience in operating in both an independent and team environment dealing with resource management and environmental policies. His experience includes dealing with multiple user groups, including environmental activists, special interests groups, First Nations and governmental bodies. He had experience in northern issues, remediation technologies and techniques, and drafting technical reports and applying and enforcing municipal, provincial and federal legislation.\n(iv) Adrian Paradis [40] Adrian Paradis has an Environmental Monitoring and Enforcement Diploma (Lakeland College, Alberta, 1995-1997). He attended the University of Alberta from 1997 to 1999 taking courses in Land Remediation, Reclamation and Conservation.\n[41] He worked as an Environmental Technologist for various companies between 1997 and 1998 and has worked as an Environmental Technician conducting Phase I, II, III, environmental site assessments. He has training in techniques of revegetation, reclamation and decommissioning techniques. He also has experience in dealing with regulatory bodies and landowners.\n(v) Allen Kogiak [42] Allen Kogiak has a diploma in Renewable Resource Technology (Aurora College, Fort Smith, NWT, 1994) and a PITS Certificate in Environmental Land Management (1997).\n[43] He has considerable experience working in the North, working as a Fisheries Management Technician in Hay River, NWT (1993-1994); a field worker for the Salt River First Nations, Fort Smith, NWT, doing research, mapping, conducting scientific research and liaising with the public and governments (1994-1995); working as a research management officer for DIAND, Inuvik, NWT, which involved working with municipal, territorial and federal government officials, First Nations, Community Leaders, consultants and industry executives to exchange and obtain information on legislation requirements, prepare reports, and maintain records and files (1995-2000). He also worked with the Dogrib Rae Band, Rae, NWT as a Colomac Mines Clean up Project Coordinator (March 2001-May 2001) and as a Site Superintendent Trainee at the Colomac Mine site at Tli Cho logistic, Yellowknife, NWT.\n(vi) Ethan Sawchuk [44] Ethan Sawchuk obtained a B.Sc. in Land use and Environment studies (University of Saskatchewan, 2000). He also has an advanced Certificate in Biology. He was a Land Management Officer with the Inuvialuit Land Administration where his responsibilities were to review and process land use development applications, consult and coordinate with industry representatives, government and aboriginal community organizations, undertake inspections, and produce reports.\n(vii) Latisha Heilman [45] Latisha Heilman has a B.Sc. in Environmental Biology (University of Alberta). She is trained in GIS (Geographical Information Systems). Her experience includes working as a field and lab assistant at the University of Alberta, in the Department of Biological Sciences. Her responsibilities included experimental design and setup, collection of data in the field, organizing and interpreting data, techniques of analysis, and providing written reports. She has no northern experience.\n(viii) Andrew Hammond [46] Andrew Hammond has a BA in Archeology\/Anthropology, and Native Studies (University of Saskatchewan, 1997). He has considerable experience working in Canada's north, including working as an Environmental Technician for BHP Diamonds Inc. in Yellowknife, NWT (1997-2001. He also worked on the Community Consultation database for the Tibbit to Contwoyto Lake Winter Road Joint Venture (1997-2001).\n[47] He was a Policy Analyst with the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs of the GNWT working in Yellowknife. Some of his responsibilities included editing and revising internal guidelines used in land claim negotiations.\n[48] From November 1993 to June 1994, he was a Research Policy Analyst at Aurora College in Iqaluit, NU, where he was part of a team conducting a five year corporate review of the Iqaluit campus.\n[49] From 1991 to 1992, he was a Research Analyst with the Department of Health, GNWT, Yellowknife, where he reviewed and evaluated the department's health position on the northern health, research and development programs. From 1990 to 1994, he also worked as a Science Administrator with the Science Institute of NWT, Yellowknife.\nF. Why the Six Candidates Were Offered a RO Position and Dr. Sangha Was Not. [50] Both Ms. Anderson and Mr. Lennie-Misgeld testified as to how the Interview Committee selected the six candidates for an offer. Mr. Lauten did not appear at the hearing. All of the candidates interviewed were given a numerical score representing each of the interviewer's assessment of how the applicant has answered the interview questions. The maximum score was 60.\n[51] Ms. Anderson rated Dr. Sangha 41\/60 based on her assessment of his answers to the questions. She rated no on her interview notes indicating that she would not make an offer to Dr. Sangha. She noted that Dr. Sangha could be overqualified, would be easily bored and would look for another job quickly. She also noted that Dr. Sangha was more of a policy person, that he was able to answer the questions well and he came across as very smart.\n[52] Ms. Anderson testified that during the interview, Dr. Sangha was not asked by any of the interviewers why he had applied for the RO position. Nor did they raise their concerns that he would find the job unchallenging or boring and would be likely to leave at the first opportunity.\n[53] Ms. Anderson said that Dr. Sangha had asked for a salary of $55,000. If he had been hired, Ms. Anderson said he would have been paid that amount.\n[54] Ms. Anderson scored Stephen Mathyk 48\/60. She wrote yes on her interview notes indicating that he should be made an offer. She felt that with his background, knowledge and his experience, he was a very good candidate. He had enforcement background and that experience would benefit the Board.\n[55] Ethan Sawchuk was working for the Inuvialuit Land Administration as a Regulatory Officer. This was particularly relevant to the work of the Board. Ms. Anderson rated him 45\/60. His education and his northern experience made him a very good candidate. Ms. Anderson's interview notes indicated Mr. Sawchuk had good technical knowledge relating to land use permits. He also had good policy understanding and first hand experience.\n[56] Ms. Anderson gave Allen Kogiak a score of 37\/60. Mr. Kogiak was working at the Colomac mine site in the NWT which was under remediation. Ms. Anderson thought that he had good knowledge of that mine site, its problems and what needed to be done in terms of remediation. He also had northern experience and had lived in the north. She indicated in her interview notes that he should be hired.\n[57] Adrian Paradis had two years education from the University of Alberta in Land Remediation, Reclamation and Conservation and had an Environmental Enforcement Diploma. He also had experience working in the oil fields of Alberta. Because there were a number of oil and gas projects coming on in the NWT, Ms. Anderson considered Mr. Paradis to be a good candidate for oil and gas issues. She indicated yes for hire in her notes and scored Mr. Paradis 45\/60 on the interview. He did not have any northern experience.\n[58] Because Allen Kogiak and Ethan Sawchuk did not accept the Board's offers, two further offers were made to Latisha Heilman and Andrew Hammond.\n[59] Ms. Anderson rated Ms. Heilman 36\/60 on the interview. She noted in her interview notes that Ms. Heilman had training in GIS and that land use planning was one of her main interests. She thought she would be a good candidate for the RO position because at the time there were no land use plans in place anywhere in any of the regions. It would be useful for the Board to have someone with that knowledge and training.\n[60] As for Andrew Hammond, Ms. Anderson gave him a score of 36\/60 on the interview. He had been working for at least three years for BHP Diamond's project in Yellowknife as an Environmental Technician. He had northern experience and had working knowledge of one of the important mine sites and how mines actually operate in the north. She also felt that it was very relevant that Mr. Hammond worked at the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs for the GNWT as a Policy Analyst in Yellowknife, and had experience in dealing with land claim negotiations and in particular dealing with First Nations and communities.\n[61] Karl Lauten, the Manager of Regulatory Operations in August\/September 2001, did not give evidence at the hearing of the complaint, but his notes of the interviews were put in evidence. Mr. Lauten rated Stephen Mathyk 48\/60. He rated Adrian Paradis 41\/60, Allen Kogiak 50\/60 and Ethan Sawchuk 47\/60. He rated Latisha Heilman and Andrew Hammond 46\/60 for the interviews.\n[62] Interestingly, Mr. Lauten rated Dr. Sangha the highest on the interview, scoring him 52\/60. He indicated that Dr. Sangha had lots of academic and work experience and made much effort to review the Board's website, the Act and Regulations. But he noted that Dr. Sangha had no northern experience.\n[63] Mr. Lennie-Misgeld testified as to why he thought the six candidates that were offered jobs were the best qualified. His views on the candidates are as follows:\n[64] Latisha Heilman's education and work experience were directly applicable to the work of an RO.\n[65] Stephen Mathyk had enforcement experience and the Board was looking to add additional capacity in terms of environmental enforcement.\n[66] Adrian Paradis had done some site assessments and also had experience in remediation of well sites. His experience would be useful to the Board for oil and gas applications.\n[67] Andrew Hammond had valuable experience working in the archeological field in the north. He had also worked for one of the diamond mines so he had some directive environmental field experience. His experience working with First Nations people and in the archeological field was relevant to the responsibilities of the RO liaising and working with First Nations and Community groups. Archeological and cultural views are very important to the people of the North. It is a primary concern to them when it comes to development applications.\n[68] Allen Kogiak had experience working as Resource Management Officer for DIAND. In that position, he was responsible for enforcing terms and conditions of land use permits which is one of the major functions of the Board. His experience on the enforcement side would also contribute to the Board's work. He had also worked at the Colomac mine site, an abandoned mine near Yellowknife, so he had a combination of enforcement experience as well as field experience in terms of remediation.\n[69] Ethan Sawchuk at the time was working for the Inuvaluit Land Administration as a Land Management Officer. The role of that agency is very similar to the work of the Board so he had directly applicable work experience.\n[70] As to Dr. Sangha, Mr. Lennie-Misgeld believed that he had the experience and the education. But the RO position is an entry level position in the environmental field. The work can be very repetitive and he believed that it would not sufficiently challenge Dr. Sangha's skillset. And there is little opportunity for promotion at the Board for ROs.\nG. Post-Interview Procedure [71] After the interviews were completed, the Interview Committee met and decided who would be made offers. They based their decision on the resumes, the interview notes, who they considered would be a good fit, and the knowledge and experience they could bring to the position. The interview scores were just one criterion and certainly not the deciding factor.\n[72] There was unanimous agreement amongst the Interview Committee that offers should be made to Stephen Mathyk, Adrian Paradis, Allen Kogiak, and Ethan Sawchuk as the best candidates. The next two ranked candidates were Latisha Heilman and Andrew Hammond.\n[73] As for Dr. Sangha, there was consensus in the Interview Committee not to offer him a position. Their view was that Dr. Sangha was overqualified for an RO. Because the position was an entry level position, they believed that he would be bored by the type of work required and was not a good fit for the position. The other candidates much better suited the job requirements.\n[74] Robert Wooley, the current Executive Director of the Board, (he joined the Board in October, 2001) gave evidence at the hearing. Although Mr. Wooley was not at the Board when the new RO's were hired, he testified that he had reviewed Dr. Sangha's resume and had spoken with the members of the Interview Board. He said that he was and continues to be impressed by Dr. Sangha's academic credentials. But he did not see how those credentials would serve him well as an RO. His credentials are far greater than what is required.\n[75] In forming this view, Mr. Wooley said that he relied on his experience as a senior manager for over 20 years, managing people with varying backgrounds. This experience indicates that someone with Dr. Sangha's qualifications would not be satisfied with the work environment, or with this level of job, and would not be happy for any length of time.\n[76] Mr. Wooley's assessment of the work of an RO was that it is a step above tedious. The job can have its interesting moments, but for the most part, it is a lot of the same thing, pushing paper, cajoling, phoning, faxing and assembling a stack of papers for the staff report.\nH. Staff Turnover [77] Mr. Wooley testified that when he came to the Board as the Executive Director, in October 2001, there was a lot of employee turnover. He believes that it has turned around somewhat, but there is still some turnover.\n[78] Mr. Wooley does not consider that to be such a bad thing. A lot of the staff are young and are career oriented. Working at the Board gives them exposure to a wide spectrum of industries and technologies. They get known by consulting groups, exploration companies and by government. Often when they have enough experience they will move to one of these organizations.\n[79] Others leave the Board for other reasons, such as spousal transfers, or they get tired of living in Yellowknife, tired of the dark and the cold during the winter. Some just want to go elsewhere. Employee turnover is an issue related to being located in Canada's north. That is one of the reasons the Board prefers northern experience.\n[80] According to Mr. Wooley the Board must be very careful to hire somebody with some assurance that they will stay for some time. It is expensive to bring them to the NWT. The Board pays their relocation expenses and also gives them ongoing training. A lot of money is expended, and if someone decides that the north is not where they want to be, then that money is wasted.\n[81] Expenses include around $10,000 to get someone to come to the NWT and they are also paid relocation expenses at the end of the term.\n[82] Ms. Anderson testified that staff turnover at the Board was about the same as for other agencies in the north. After a certain point in time, Board staff seeks to advance their careers. At the Board the only option is to look elsewhere, and most of the staff that left, did just that. Ms. Anderson regards staff turnover at the Board as a cost of doing business in the north.\n[83] On the question of turnover, there were six Regulatory Officers at the Board in October 2001. They were Elaine deBastien, Greg Smith, Janpeter Lennie-Misgeld, Darren Campbell, Emma Pike, and Lori Bruno. Lennie-Misgeld, deBastien and Pike all started in 2000. The others started later.\n[84] Darren Campbell left in September 2001 for personal reasons. His wife did not like living in Yellowknife.\n[85] Mr. Lennie-Misgeld moved up to Senior Regulatory Officer in August 2001.\n[86] Elaine deBastien left in 2002\/03. Her husband moved to Edmonton and she moved with him before her contract ended.\n[87] Greg Smith left in 2004. His wife got a job at the hospital in Sudbury, and he moved with her, before his three-year term ended.\n[88] Lori Bruno left for personal reasons as well. Her husband didn't like Yellowknife, so she got a job in Fort McMurray.\n[89] Emma Pike went to the federal government.\n[90] Andrew Hammond resigned before his term was finished because his wife, a medical doctor, got a job in Ontario.\n[91] Latisha Heilman was offered an extension, after her three year term, but she declined. She wanted to travel.\n[92] Adrian Paradis' and Stephen Mathyk's terms were extended for a further two years.\n[93] Thus, since 2001 the Board had almost a complete turnover of ROs over the following 4-5 years. With the departure of these Regulatory Officers, the Board has hired four more Regulatory officers; two were hired about a year and a half ago, and two were hired seven months ago. They were hired through an open competition which was posted on the Board's website. But Mr. Wooley was not sure if the positions were advertised in any major papers.\nI. Dr. Sangha's Reaction to Not Being Offered the Regulatory Officer Position - Pain & Suffering [94] After the interview, Dr. Sangha returned home positive that he would be offered the job. He told his family that the interview had gone well.\n[95] But when he received the email from Ms. Anderson advising that he would not be offered an RO position, he was very upset. Obtaining the position meant that he would be working within his profession and gaining some Canadian experience in the environmental field. It also meant very much economically. It was a good paying job and his family was planning to join him in Yellowknife.\n[96] Dr. Sangha also testified that he became depressed over not getting the job. He consulted his family doctor who prescribed anti-depression medication. His doctor advised him that the medication could have some negative effects. For this reason, he only took them occasionally and then eventually stopped using them.\nJ. Dr. Sangha's Efforts to Obtain Other Employment - Mitigation [97] Some time after his application was not accepted, Dr. Sangha started working as a landscaping gardener. He had to travel each day for one hour in the heavy traffic and was working outside in the rain and the wind. He was so tired from this work that he had no time or no energy to look for other jobs.\n[98] After a while, Dr. Sangha again began to look for jobs. He sent out about 15 resumes, had two or three interviews, but received no offers. He applied for jobs in government and in the private sector. Sometimes the jobs advertised were in his specialty, sometimes not. Even if not, he would still apply.\n[99] Dr. Sangha contacted St. Cloud State University to see if there was any opportunity and was told again that there was no opportunity.\n[100] Since he started working at Gill Electric, he has not applied for any other jobs.\n(i) Income Earned Since 2001 [101] Dr. Sangha filed a summary of his earnings and his tax returns. This shows earnings of $62, 701 from all sources.\n[102] Dr. Sangha also has an arrangement with Columbia State University whose website lists him as Professor, Occupational Safety and Health. This is an online university that offers courses online.\n[103] The website also shows that he has taught courses for Columbia State University, including, toxicology, waste management, pollution prevention, industrial hygiene and advanced air quality control. Dr. Sangha said that he does not teach students, but rather interacts with the students by email or by telephone.\n[104] He started with Columbia State University sometime in 2003. His evidence is that this is not a full-time position, that he is not paid a regular salary, but is paid an honorarium of between $300 and $600 per assignment. He continues to work for Columbia State University. He says that he does so to keep in touch academically.\nK. The Remedy for Dr. Sangha [105] Dr. Sangha asks for compensation for three years at a salary of $55,000, being his potential earnings as an RO. He also asks that the Tribunal order the Board to hire him as an RO at the next available opportunity.\n[106] He also claims compensation for pain and suffering in the mid-range, given the maximum of $20,000.\n[107] The Commission seeks a policy remedy that the Board work with the Commission to ensure that this type of discrimination does not occur in the future.\n[108] As to Dr. Sangha's request to be hired as an RO, Mr. Wooley testified that, future land claim settlements could result in a significant reduction in the Board's staff. With each land claim settlement, the Board's jurisdiction to issue land use permits and water licences would extend only to the remaining unsettled areas and transboundary applications.\n[109] The Board staff could shrink to a five or six-person office, including the Executive Director and Office Manager to deal with budgets and two or three ROs. He therefore resists Dr. Sangha's request to be hired as an RO.\n[110] On the question of whether an RO would be extended, Mr. Wooley said that it has been his policy to try to maintain a stable workforce. If an RO was a good employee and the Board was happy with their work, they could expect to be extended, usually for two more years. Unless the work of the Board is significantly reduced.\nL. Using Overqualification to Screen Job Applicants [111] The Commission and the complainant assert that decisions not to hire overqualified job applicants have an adverse effect on visible minority immigrants. Overqualification is an illegitimate criterion to use when applied to this particular group. It contains a number of assumptions about the group and their motivations that are not necessarily valid.\n[112] The Commission and the complainant also allege that a practice or policy of not hiring the overqualified amounts to age discrimination against older workers.\nM. The Expert Evidence of Dr. Jeffrey Reitz [113] The Commission and the complainant called Dr. Jeffrey Reitz to give expert opinion evidence on their behalf. Dr. Reitz is a Professor of Sociology, the Harney Professor of Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies and Director of the Graduate Collaborative Program in Ethnic and Pluralism Studies, at the University of Toronto.\n[114] He has 35 years of experience in sociological research and teaching on the general topics of race and ethnic relations, and immigration. Much of his research focuses on the employment of immigrants and visible minorities, and barriers to the employment success of minorities including discriminatory barriers. Dr. Reitz has published seven books and monographs, as well as numerous articles, book chapters and edited books that have examined these and related topics.\n[115] Dr. Reitz was qualified to give expert evidence in the area of race and ethnic relations and immigration issues as they relate to employment.\n[116] The global thesis of Dr. Reitz's evidence is that not hiring overqualified job applicants has an adverse impact specifically on visible minority immigrants. Overqualified job applicants are those whose education and experience significantly exceed the requirements specified as necessary for a particular job.\n[117] Dr. Reitz defines immigrants as foreign-born residents of Canada irrespective of their length of stay in Canada and whether or not they are citizens. Since the 1970's, the origins of the majority of immigrants to Canada are Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. Immigrants to Canada from these regions are considered to be racial or visible minorities in Canada.\n[118] Dr. Reitz has five supporting conclusions.\n(i) Educational Levels and Experience Levels of Immigrants and Visible Minorities [119] Conclusion One: Immigrants are, on average, more highly educated than native-born Canadians. Dr. Reitz points out that immigrants arriving in Canada since the 1970s, most of whom are considered to be visible minorities, possess high education levels and a substantial portion are qualified professionals. According to the 1996 Canadian census data, immigrants average 0.4 more years of education than native-born. And with more recent immigrants, the trend is upward so that the relative level of education of immigrants is closer to 0.6 years more.\n[120] The reason for this, says Dr. Reitz, is that the largest single number of immigrants to Canada are independent or economic immigrants, who are selected on the basis of a points-based system. According to Dr. Reitz, the 1996 Canada census showed that working age immigrants arriving in the most recent five year period had an average of 14 years of education and nearly 30 % had university degrees. Among later arriving immigrants, in 2000 for example, about 45 % had university degrees.\n(ii) Employment Barriers Affecting Immigrants and Visible Minorities [121] Conclusion Two: Visible minority immigrants face barriers to employment at their level of qualification. These barriers force highly qualified visible minority immigrants to seek lower skilled jobs.\n[122] Dr. Reitz' evidence is that the research identifies various types of barriers to equal opportunity for immigrants. These include discriminatory hiring practices based on race, immigrant status or origin; employers' unfamiliarity with foreign acquired education; lack of credit for non-Canadian work experience\/no Canadian work experience; licensing bodies' refusal to recognize foreign acquired education\/experience; and lack of social contacts useful in gaining labour market access.\n[123] Dr. Reitz refers to various studies and reports which show significant numbers of immigrants report difficulties in qualification recognition. Significant numbers (20%) of visible minorities perceive discrimination in employment.\n[124] Dr. Reitz also referred to comparative analyses (census and labour market surveys) of immigrants' earnings and the earnings of native-born Canadians, which reveal the following:\nimmigrants receive a significantly smaller earnings premium both for formal education and for work experience. visible minority immigrants earn significantly less than non-visible minority immigrants.\n[125] Earnings analysis provides an estimate as to how much immigrants would have earned by substituting important characteristics (work experience, education) into the earnings equations of Canadians.\n[126] This analysis shows that if immigrants were given full compensation (based on the data of Canadians) for their years of education and work experience (and no origin discount), immigrant earnings would increase by $15 billion. Further analysis suggests that $2.4 billion (16%) of that earning deficit is due to skill underutilization.\n(iii) Representation of Immigrants in Highly Skilled Occupations [127] Conclusion Three: As a result of barriers, immigrants are under-represented in highly skilled professional or managerial jobs, the knowledge occupations, and are over-represented in lower-skilled jobs, compared to Canadians with the same paper qualifications.\n[128] Dr. Reitz's evidence is that, often the qualification of immigrants performing low-skill jobs is considerably higher compared to Canadians doing the same job.\n[129] Dr. Reitz referred to studies that showed, for highly qualified individuals, immigrants are underrepresented in the knowledge occupations. Knowledge occupations are those where a high proportion of workers have university education (e.g. science, engineering, health, education and the professions). The 1996 census showed that, in the knowledge professions there were 35% of immigrant men with a Bachelors degree compared to 59% of Canadian men with similar qualifications; 59% of male immigrants with post-graduate degrees versus 79% of male Canadians.\n[130] For women, the discrepancy was even greater: 49% of post-graduate female immigrants compared to 78% female Canadians with post-graduate degrees.\n[131] From 1981 to 1996, the importance of the knowledge occupations and the skill levels of immigrants have increased. Yet the difference (vis-\u00e0-vis Canadians) in income level and representation has grown as well. Immigrant representation in the knowledge occupations has fallen in absolute terms from 1981 to 1996.\n[132] Dr. Reitz also pointed out that the analysis of the 1996 data also shows that for the knowledge occupations as a whole, immigrants have greater difficulty accessing managerial positions compared to professional positions.\n[133] Denied work in the knowledge occupations at their skill level, and experiencing greater educational competition in lower-level work, immigrants end up often in the least skilled occupations.\n[134] Recent studies (based on the 2001 census data) found that among recent immigrants with a university degree, and employed between 1999 and 2001, at least 25% have jobs requiring no more than a high school education. This is compared to 12% of Canadian university graduates in the same age group in the year 2001, an overrepresentation of visible minorities by a factor of more than 2.\n[135] In the older age group, 45 to 54, the proportion of visible minority university graduates working in low education jobs was 38%. The corresponding percentage for Canadian-born in the same age group, 10%, is an overrepresentation by a factor of almost 4.\n(iv) Why Immigrants Accept Work For Which They Are Overqualified. [136] Conclusion Four: Immigrants often accept work for which they are overqualified because they are denied employment at their level of qualification.\n[137] Dr Reitz's evidence is that immigrants come to Canada from countries in which economic opportunities are significantly less than in Canada. For the independent immigrant, improving economic opportunities is their prime motive for migration.\n[138] Their point of comparison is not the jobs held by comparatively qualified Canadians. It is the jobs held in their country of origin by comparatively qualified persons there. This comparison favours Canada, notwithstanding the barriers in Canada to equality of employment.\n[139] However, Dr. Reitz pointed out, even if they have plans to move ahead and overcome these barriers to higher levels of employment, they often may not be able to achieve this for various reasons. They can't finance the required education to move ahead or they can't afford to take time off work and jeopardize their children's educational future. In this latter respect, they may have a future orientation which puts a priority on a better life for the next generation.\n(v) Are Overqualified Workers Less Satisfactory? [140] Conclusion Five: There is no human resources principle regarding the hiring of overqualified workers.\n[141] Dr. Reitz`s evidence is that there is a great deal of folklore among practitioners on both sides of this question. Studies of overqualified workers support both positive and negative outcomes. The Hersch study (1995) suggests good performance, less training, more promotions, but higher turnover. Most labour force studies show that the overqualified have higher earnings than other workers within their occupations.\n[142] However, Dr. Reitz says, there do not appear to be any studies specifically focusing on immigrants. His position is that turnover results from opportunities. But, for immigrants, barriers eliminate these opportunities, with the result that the turnover problem may not be so acute for visible minority immigrants.\n[143] Dr. Reitz agrees that much of the statistical data that he relied upon for his analysis is self-reporting information. This would be a perception of what individuals believe their educational qualifications to be. He also agrees that there is no measurement to verify the educational equivalence of the self-reported information.\n[144] Dr. Reitz was asked about Canadian job applicants and whether they would not be equally impacted by a policy to not hire the overqualified as would be a visible minority immigrant.\n[145] His response was that anyone who does not get a job for which they are qualified is obviously going to be impacted. The question is who is most likely to be in that applicant pool? The evidence is that, for all of the reasons he has put forward, that person is likely a racial minority immigrant. So if you have a policy of not hiring the overqualified, that is the person who will be screened out.\nN. Older Workers - Age Discrimination [146] Dr. Reitz put the proposition that not hiring the overqualified has also been considered as a source of discrimination against older workers. Dr. Sangha is in this group. The argument is that older workers who experience job loss, but who wish to continue work, must apply for entry level employment because of lack of opportunities at their former level of employment and pay. However, because of their long experience and accomplishments, many employers are reluctant to hire them believing that they may be bored or lack commitment to a lower level position. Employers will rely on overqualification as the basis for rejecting the older candidates.\nO. The Board's Expert - Dr. Derek Chapman [147] Dr. Chapman is an Associate Professor in Industrial and Organizational Psychology at the University of Calgary. He teaches undergraduate courses in personnel selection and organizational behaviour. At the graduate level, he teaches a Ph.D. seminar in personnel selection, a Ph.D. seminar in recruiting and an advanced course on Industrial and Organizational psychology.\n[148] Dr. Chapman has a B.A. (Psychology and English, St Mary's University, 1989); and an MA \/Ph.D. (Industrial and Organizational Psychology, University of Waterloo, 2000). He has published extensively in refereed journals in the area of personnel selection, recruiting, and organizational psychology. This includes research on how people choose their jobs, and what factors lead to that decision, as well as research relating to person\/organization fit and employee turnover.\n[149] Dr. Chapman worked for six years as a personnel selection officer in the Department of National Defence. This involved interviewing job applicants, assessing their credentials, directing structured interviews, writing reports, and doing individual assessments on individuals for approximately 120 to 140 different types of occupations.\n[150] He has worked as an independent consultant for a number of organizations, assisting them in developing and validating their selection systems and recruiting operations, so that the systems operate to select the best people into the best jobs with the most appropriate fit.\n[151] Dr. Chapman was qualified as an expert in the area of personnel selection, recruiting, and organizational psychology, to address whether the selection methods used by the Board to evaluate candidates for the RO position were appropriate, including the decision not to hire Dr. Sangha. And whether the practice of an employer to exclude candidates on the basis of poor job fit, including overqualification, is a common method in the human resource field.\n[152] In preparing his expert testimony, Dr. Chapman reviewed all of the 38 applications received by the Board, including Dr. Sangha's. He also reviewed the job description and the job advertisement for the RO position.\nP. Personnel Selection Practices, Overqualified and Job Fit [153] Dr Chapman's overall opinion is that not selecting candidates for positions of employment on the basis of poor person\/job fit, including overqualification is a widely practiced human resource selection method. There is a great deal of data that suggests that there are negative outcomes for both people who are hired into positions for which they are overqualified, as well as negative outcomes for employers such as paying higher wages, turnover effects, reduced or poor employee attitudes and lower job performance.\n[154] Dr. Chapman defines personnel selection practices as being the procedures that organizations go through to try to hire the best fitting person for the job which they may have available. These procedures identify the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are required for a particular job and the goals of selection.\n[155] Dr. Chapman does not accept the proposition that, in the case of an overqualified person, an employer should look beyond the criterion of good person\/job fit and consider the personal circumstances of the candidate, i.e. what they can offer beyond their education and experience.\n[156] For Dr. Chapman, no one is overqualified in relation to candidate selection. An individual becomes overqualified only when they apply for a job for which their credentials exceed the requirements of the job.\n[157] Dr. Chapman prefers to use the concept of person\/job fit, meaning how well a person's skill sets mesh with the requirements of the job. In this context, overqualified refers to a poor fit between the individual and the job that they are applying for because their formal credentials exceed what is required for the job.\nQ. Pre-Screening the Overqualified [158] Dr. Chapman strongly disagreed with Dr. Reitz that there is no human resource principle regarding the hiring of overqualified workers. That there is only folklore on both sides of the issue.\n[159] On the contrary, screening candidates on the basis of overqualification is a well established human resources principle and practice. Personnel selection is an entire field devoted to trying to match people to their jobs.\n[160] It is an appropriate criterion for a number of reasons. For the most part, employers usually don't have time to sit down and talk to each person about their story and have them explain why they are applying, when it is apparent that their credentials are either far below or far above the levels that are required for the job.\n[161] In support of his position, Dr. Chapman referred to a 1992 study (Bills, The Mutability of Educational Credentials: How Employers Evaluate Highly Credentialed Job Candidates). This study looked at the extent to which employers were willing to interview job applicants whose credentials were very high relative to what the job required.\n[162] This study found that 72% of employers would not hire atypically credentialed candidates. This speaks to the prevalence of screening out applicants with these credentials at the pre-interview stage.\nR. Reasons for Screening Out the Overqualified [163] Dr. Chapman's evidence is that there are a number of consequences of hiring an individual who is a poor person\/job fit, both for the organization and for the individual who is hired. A 2000 study (Kristof-Brown, Consequences of Individual's Fit at Work) showed that there is a strong relationship between person\/job fit, job satisfaction and organizational commitment. An employee who fits well to the demands of the job is much less likely to indicate an intention to want to leave that job.\n[164] On the other hand, poor person\/job fit leads to an early voluntary turnover. This is a very important factor for the employer. This is so says Dr. Chapman, because hiring practices that likely result in high turnover, incur a huge cost to the organization. Typically, it costs about 30% of a person's salary to hire a person. This includes advertising costs; at a higher job level, headhunting fees; costs of flying people in for interviews and the cost of the interviewers' time to interview people.\n[165] There also can be high costs of training, having new employees learn the tasks associated with the job. There is always a period of time when people are not as productive as they can be because they are learning the job.\n[166] Dr. Chapman testified that there are selection and recruiting practices specifically designed to reduce the likelihood of turnover. Certainly hiring on the basis of job fit is one of the best practices to avoid turnover.\n[167] Dr. Chapman was asked whether sometimes an employer should consider not only an applicant's credentials, but also their personal circumstances. An applicant may be overqualified, but for personal reasons, would be more likely to perform better and more likely to stay in the job.\n[168] His response was that there sometimes could be a case made for people who have something more to offer. But the labour market works in such a way that people tend to gravitate towards the highest paying jobs they can get which match their skill sets.\n[169] You could make a case for someone who doesn't quite make the qualifications but brings something else to the organization. For example, the applicant has a diploma, not a degree, but has experience in remediation of oil and gas exploration, so the employer could stretch the fit criteria a bit on the low side.\n[170] But Dr. Chapman would not recommend doing it on the high side. The research suggests that one of the reasons that people with good credentials end up in good jobs is because they are blocked from lower level positions as overqualified. They are forced to stay in the job market until they find a more appropriate job for their background. That results in good outcomes for those people who remain in the job market long enough.\n[171] But on the facts of this case, why should the Board hire Dr. Sangha when there were 38 applicants, a number of whose credentials were more congruent with the RO job than Dr. Sangha's.\nS. Other Consequences of Hiring the Overqualified [172] Dr. Chapman identified other consequences for the employer of hiring someone who is overqualified. Employees who are hired and are a mismatch for their job often resent being there. They know that they can do more. They might be working for people who don't have the same level of skills, and yet they have to answer to these people. This can make it difficult to manage those individuals.\n[173] The data also suggests that job attitudes and performance is lower for people who are overqualified compared to those who are congruent for the job. Someone who is overqualified can do the job. But their attitude is such that they do not pay much attention to the work, thinking it is not very important, and is beneath them. They are not very challenged in those positions. They are not motivated to do a good job because they don't see it as being important work or something that is sufficiently up to their skills and knowledge.\n[174] Also, people with higher credentials often demand higher wages. That can result in higher costs for the employer if they are forced to hire people with credentials that are not needed for the job.\n[175] The research also shows negative mental health effects on people who are hired into underemployed positions, such as increased depression, increased mental anxiety. One study (Leanna and Feldman, 1995, Finding New Jobs after a Plant Closing) followed people who were unemployed versus underemployed. People who took jobs that didn't meet their skillset, versus those who remained unemployed and stayed in the job market had equal levels of anxiety and depression.\nT. Dr. Reitz's Use of Census and Labour Force Data [176] Dr. Chapman was critical of Dr. Reitz's reliance on Statistics Canada data. Census data is self-reporting data. It is a survey that is sent out to people with the expectation that they complete it correctly. But their response is their own understanding of the situation. There is no objective checking to see whether the credentials that are reported are, in fact, equivalent to what people say they are. As a consequence, says Dr. Chapman, you want to be cautious in interpreting these statistics and drawing conclusions from them. He would prefer not to do so without more on-the-ground research to see what is really driving these relationships.\nU. Barriers to Visible Minority Immigrants [177] Dr. Chapman was very clear that he did not consider it appropriate to hire immigrants who are overqualified for a particular position of employment. He would not make a distinction between immigrants and any other group. If there are barriers faced by immigrants to equal workplace opportunity, he advocates that these barriers be addressed rather than putting someone into a position for which they are overqualified.\n[178] To require employers to hire people into jobs that are incongruous with their abilities is not good skill utilization. Investing in systems that evaluate credentials or eliminating discriminatory barriers would be a much more effective way of dealing with this problem.\nV. His Assessment of the Board's Interview Method [179] Dr. Chapman testified that, broadly, there are two major types of interviews. Smaller organizations typically use unstructured interviews. This is where someone sits down with the applicant, goes over their resume and chats with them for a while. The questions can vary from candidate to candidate, depending on what topics come up. There is no list of questions. Different people might conduct the interview differently.\n[180] The second type is the structured interview where each candidate is asked the same job-related questions and their answers are scored. Because there are no informal conversations, every candidate is treated the same, the interview is more objective, and there is little opportunity for bias.\n[181] Dr. Chapman said that there are different types of scoring methods that can be used. Each individual question may be scored; or each interviewer gives an overall score at the end of the interview; or the scores of the interviewers may not be aggregated.\n[182] The scores among the interviewers may vary because of a severity bias or leniency bias, when an interviewer typically scores either lower or higher than his\/her colleagues. But as long as the rank order is the same, it is not a concern.\n[183] Dr. Chapman said that he was pleasantly surprised that the Board used a structured interview. Very few small organizations have the resources to do so. His assessment was the questions were well chosen, were job related, and did not relate to any of the protected grounds.\nW. Dr. Chapman's Assessment of Dr. Sangha [184] Dr. Chapman did his own assessment of whether Dr. Sangha would be a good fit for the RO position. He concluded that Dr. Sangha's qualifications were incongruous with the duties of the RO position. He was a successful academic at two universities. The first job in Canada on his resume indicates that he was a senior research scientist, which is consistent with what you might expect from someone with a Ph.D.\n[185] Other jobs that he stated on his resume indicate he was a manager in a nursery, so he was someone with management responsibilities. His most recent job in his area of expertise was as an assistant professor at a respected U.S. University.\n[186] Given that the RO position is essentially clerical in nature, there would be very little opportunity to utilize the skills and knowledge that Dr. Sangha acquired through his many years of education.\n[187] Dr. Chapman would have screened him out before the interview. To bring someone in with Dr. Sangha's background for the RO job just perpetuates underemployment in that individual.\n[188] In Dr. Chapman's opinion, to hire Dr. Sangha would have negative organizational outcomes with respect to lower performance on the job due to being bored, being unchallenged, as well as being a high turnover risk. Based on the information that he saw, Dr. Chapman was very surprised that Dr. Sangha was brought in for an interview.\n[189] Dr. Chapman also has some concerns relating to Dr. Sangha's employment history as it relates to turnover. He has a pattern of short-term employment, four different jobs over four years. This is normally indicative of a person being unhappy with their jobs and moving from place to place.\n[190] Dr. Chapman believes that although the Board agreed to interview Dr. Sangha, even though he was obviously overqualified, the Board, in the end, made the right decision not to hire Dr. Sangha.\nX. Has the Complainant Established a Prima Facie Case? [191] In a case before this Tribunal, the onus is on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made, and which if believed, is completed and sufficient for a decision in favor of the complainant, in the absence of an explanation from the respondent.\n[192] A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made, and which if believed, is complete and sufficient for a decision in favor of the complainant, in the absence of an explanation from the respondent. (Ontario (HRC) v. Etobicoke, [1982] I.S.C.R. 202; Ontario (HRC) and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd, [1985] 2 S.C.R., 563)\n[193] In Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 F.C.A. 204, the Federal Court of Appeal provided further guidance as to the approach to be taken by the Tribunal. The Court said that, the Tribunal should not take into account the Respondent's answer before deciding whether the complainant has established a prima facie case.\n[194] To establish a prima facie case on the facts of this case, I find that the complainant must show:\nthat the complainant possessed the basic qualifications for the job; that the complainant is a visible minority immigrant; that the complainant is overqualified vis-\u00e0-vis the job in question; that overqualified status was one of the reasons why the complainant was not hired; and that there is a correlation between visible minority immigrant status and overqualified status.\n[195] Clearly, the complainant satisfies (a), (b) and (c). As to (d), the Board concedes that one of the reasons why Dr. Sangha was not hired for the RO position was because he was deemed to be overqualified.\n[196] Thus it remains to be determined whether the complainant can satisfy (e).\nY. The Prima Facie Case for the Complainant [197] Dr. Reitz's testimony indicated that most immigrants to Canada in recent decades have been highly educated members of a visible minority. However, his statistics indicate that, despite comparable education levels to native-born Canadians, immigrants are under-represented in the knowledge occupations.\n[198] Moreover, studies indicate that immigrants earn substantially less than native-born Canadians having equivalent qualifications (education and work experience). A significant portion of this earnings deficit is attributable to the fact that many immigrants are not fully utilizing their acquired skills.\n[199] Dr. Reitz argues that there is a correlation between under-representation of immigrants in jobs at their highest level of qualification, and over representation in jobs where their qualifications exceed what is required. Because visible minority immigrants are disproportionately excluded from the higher rungs of the job market due to barriers to employment at this level, they seek employment at lower echelons where their qualifications exceed the job requirements.\n[200] Hence, the experience of applying for a job for which one is overqualified, or working in such a job, is disproportionately an immigrant experience. While many native-born Canadians may find themselves seeking or performing work for which they are overqualified, they are less prone to be in this situation because the native-born do not face the same widespread exclusion from jobs that utilize the full extent of their qualifications.\n[201] When an employer, such as the Board, adopts a rule against the hiring of overqualified candidates, it may appear to be neutral in that it applies equally to all overqualified candidates (immigrant and native-born). And yet it has a discriminatory effect upon overqualified immigrant candidates: it imposes, because of some special characteristic of the group, penalties or restrictive conditions not imposed on other members of the work force.\n[202] What penalties or restrictive conditions? Simply this: to the degree that native-born candidates who are rejected on the basis of over-qualification have the option of seeking work more suited to their resumes, this option is largely foreclosed for immigrants. They have already been excluded from suitable jobs and can reasonably expect this exclusion to continue indefinitely into the future. Thus, a policy or practice against the hiring of overqualified candidates affects them differently from others to whom it may also apply.\n[203] The evidence of Dr. Reitz establishes that there is a correlation between visible minority immigrant status and overqualified status. For this reason, I have concluded that the complainant has established a prima facie case that he was rejected on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nZ. Has the Board Answered the Prima Facie Case? [204] In answering this question, reference is first made to the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Holden v. CNR (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12; 112 N.R. 395 (F.C.A.). In this case, the complainant alleged that he had been discriminated against because of his age, by being forced to take early retirement. In dealing with the complaint, the Review Tribunal ruled that discrimination must be the basis for the imputed decision. The Federal Court of Appeal disagreed. It concluded that if discrimination is only one factor among other non-discriminatory factors, that is enough to find a contravention of the Act.\n[205] The Board conceded that the complainant's overqualified status played a significant role in its decision not to hire him. Thus for the Board to refute the prima facie case, it must refute the correlation between overqualified status and visible minority immigrant status.\n[206] Dr. Chapman was critical of Dr. Reitz's reliance on census and labour survey data because it is self-reporting information, being the perception or belief of those reporting. He pointed out that there is no objective checking to see whether the reported credentials are valid or equivalences. Dr. Chapman would be cautious in interpreting these statistics and drawing conclusions from them.\n[207] Dr. Chapman's critique is general. It does not nearly address the specific alleged deficiencies in Dr. Reitz's analysis. It was incumbent on the Board to prove: that Dr. Reitz' data on skill underutilization are inaccurate or no longer accurate; that visible minority immigrants do not make up a disproportionately large component of the overqualified population; that therefore they are no more likely to find themselves applying for a job for which they are overqualified than the native-born; and that on this basis there is no reason to believe that when an employer establishes a rule against hiring the overqualified, this rule has a greater impact on the visible minority immigrant candidate.\n[208] The Board did not do so. I find that the Board has not provided a sufficient answer to the complainant's prima facie case. Accordingly, I conclude that Dr. Sangha's complaint of discrimination under s. 7 of the Act is substantiated. Having found liability on the ground of national or ethnic origin, I do not need to decide whether Dr. Sangha was discriminated against on the basis of age.\nAA. What is the Appropriate Remedy? [209] The Commission asks that the respondent cease the practice of screening out visible minority immigrant candidates on the basis that they are overqualified for a particular job. The Commission and Dr. Sangha ask that he be hired for the next available RO job. They also request compensation for lost wages for a period of three years, being the three year term between September 2001 and September 2004, at $55,000\/year, grossed up for taxes. Lost wages should also take into account any loss of pension and other benefits associated with the position. Any income that Dr. Sangha earned during that period of time should be deducted from this award.\n[210] Dr. Sangha and the Commission also ask for $10,000 for pain and suffering plus interest on this amount at the Bank of Canada prime rate from the date of the complaint to the date of the payment.\n[211] Finally, the Commission asks for an order that the Board take measures in consultation with the Commission, to redress the discriminatory practice, or to prevent the same or similar practice from occurring in the future.\nII. THE AWARD [212] My assessment of the facts of this case and the witnesses from the Board suggests that it is unlikely that the Board would apply this practice in the future. The witnesses from the Board were open and forthcoming about how they were very affected by the allegations of discrimination, and in my view they have been very sensitized to issues facing visible minority immigrant job applicants. For this reason, I do not order that the Board take measures in consultation with the Commission to redress the discriminatory practice or to prevent it from occurring in the future.\n[213] I do order that, where a visible minority immigrant has been chosen for an interview for a position with the Board, that the Board cease using any policy or practice that would automatically disqualify such candidate for the reason that they are overqualified for the job. On the basis that they are overqualified for the job.\n[214] In this respect, the Board should not rely upon impressionistic markers that the overqualified are ill-suited for the job because they will become bored\/unmotivated or cause morale problems or quit prematurely. It is incumbent on the Board to make some inquiry into the candidate's motives for applying for the job, in order to obtain a more accurate prognosis of the candidate's behaviour if hired.\n[215] Turning now to the question of instatement and compensation for lost wages, in deciding this claim, I am guided by the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Attorney General) v. Morgan, [1992] 2 F.C. 401.\n[216] Morgan dealt with the issue of how to evaluate the compensation for loss of a job opportunity where there is a finding of discrimination by the Tribunal. The relevant part of the discussion is found in the reasons of Marceau J.A. In his reasons, Marceau J.A. says that the complainant is not required to prove that, but for the discrimination they would have certainly obtained the position. To establish damage does not require a probability. Rather, the test for loss of job is a mere possibility so long as it is a serious one. Of course, the uncertainty about whether a job could be denied is relevant to an assessment of the compensation. (p. 412)\n[217] For Dr. Sangha to succeed in his claim to instatement and for lost wages, he must cross the threshold of showing that there was not just a mere possibility of acquiring the job but a serious one. In my opinion, Dr. Sangha does not meet this threshold.\n[218] This is where the reasons put forward by the Board other than over-qualification became relevant. The Board's position is that the other candidates chosen for the RO position were more qualified, their qualifications were more congruent for the RO position, than those of Dr. Sangha. I agree. The evidence of the qualifications of the other candidates, as shown on their resumes, and the evidence of Ms. Anderson and Mr. Lennie-Misgeld clearly demonstrate this. I need not repeat this evidence. It is set out in great detail earlier in this decision.\n[219] For these reasons, I cannot endorse Dr. Sangha's request for instatement and compensation for lost wages.\n[220] As to Dr. Sangha's claim for pain and suffering, the evidence is that Dr. Sangha felt very positive when he returned home after the interview that he would be offered the position. When he was advised otherwise, he testified that he was very upset. He had been chosen to be interviewed when his qualifications were well known to the Board, yet he was rejected for the job in large part because he was over-qualified.\n[221] He became very depressed about not getting the job. He consulted his family doctor who prescribed anti-depressant medication which he took for some period of time. But he stopped taking it because his doctor advised that it could have some negative effects. He also said that he could not look for jobs because of his depression and because of his disappointment at not getting the RO job.\n[222] In closing argument, Dr. Sangha pointed out that one of the reasons he came to Canada was to provide a better life for himself, his family and his children. He has encountered many obstacles to getting a job in his profession even though he is highly credentialed from a well recognized Western European university. Like many new professional immigrants to Canada, he said he was considered overqualified by most of the employers that he applied to. He has not been able to provide a good quality of life for his family that is commensurate with his qualifications.\n[223] Taking this into account, he decided that he would accept a position that was within his area of expertise although it may not utilize all his skills. The job paid relatively well and would give him Canadian experience.\n[224] In deciding an amount for pain and suffering, it must be taken into account that the maximum amount of $20,000 is reserved for the most egregious of cases. This is not the situation here. The pain and suffering resulting in this case does not just stem from the actions of the Board. It also stems from the refusal of other potential employers to hire him at his skill level, and discriminatory barriers that affect visible minority immigrants.\n[225] Having considered all of the relevant facts in this case, I award Dr. Sangha the sum of $9,500 for pain and suffering.\n[226] I also award interest to be calculated in accordance with R. 9(12) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure. Interest should run from September 17, 2001, to the date of payment of the $9,500. The total of this amount plus interest shall not exceed $20,000.\n[227] Finally, Dr. Sangha estimated his out of pocket costs to be $200. The Board shall reimburse him for these costs.\nsigned by\nJ.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision rendue sans qu'une audience ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vue de faire rejeter une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre le Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations (le Mus\u00e9e). La plainte vise des all\u00e9gations faites par l'Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (AFPC) selon lesquelles le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois utilis\u00e9 par le Mus\u00e9e \u00e9tait sexiste et contraire aux articles 10 et 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[2] Le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la plainte parce que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a retir\u00e9 un rapport sur lequel \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal.\n[3] Le rapport en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Mme Lois Haignere de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Haignere Inc., une experte-conseil engag\u00e9e par la Commission au cours de l'enqu\u00eate effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte pour examiner la question de savoir si le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois du Mus\u00e9e \u00e9tait sexiste. Dans son rapport, Mme Haignere a conclu que le plan \u00e9tait probablement sexiste. L'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission a souscrit aux conclusions de Mme Haignere et a recommand\u00e9 qu'une demande soit faite afin que le Tribunal instruise la plainte. Le Mus\u00e9e et l'AFPC ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre au rapport de l'enqu\u00eateur.\n[4] Compte tenu de tous les documents dont elle disposait, notamment du rapport de l'enqu\u00eateur et du rapport de Mme Haignere, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal pour qu'il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une instruction. Le renvoi a eu lieu le 1er avril 2004.\n[5] En mai 2005, apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal eut entrepris une instruction et entendu des requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'affaire, la Commission a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal et les autres parties qu'elle n'appellerait pas Mme Haignere comme t\u00e9moin. \u00c0 ce moment, la Commission a de plus inform\u00e9 les parties qu'elle examinait la possibilit\u00e9 d'engager un autre expert.\n[6] Par la suite, la Commission a inform\u00e9 les parties et le Tribunal qu'elle avait engag\u00e9 Mme Nan Weiner pour qu'elle pr\u00e9pare un rapport. Un exemplaire de ce rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni aux parties. Dans ce rapport, Mme Weiner d\u00e9clare que bien qu'il y ait certains aspects sexistes dans le processus et le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois du Mus\u00e9e, ces aspects n'\u00e9taient probablement pas importants.\n[7] Le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas appeler Mme Haignere comme t\u00e9moin au cours de l'audience signifie que la Commission a dans les faits retir\u00e9 le rapport Haignere. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur ce rapport, le retrait du rapport constitue dans les faits un retrait de la plainte. Le Mus\u00e9e soutient que la Commission a le pouvoir, et en fait l'obligation, de retirer une plainte dans une situation comme celle en l'esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Mus\u00e9e demande avec insistance au Tribunal de conclure que lorsque la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas appeler Mme Haignere comme t\u00e9moin, elle a dans les faits exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir de retirer la plainte.\n[8] Subsidiairement, le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que le renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal est invalide. Le rapport Weiner n'\u00e9tablit pas de fa\u00e7on concluante que le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois du Mus\u00e9e comportait des aspects sexistes. Par cons\u00e9quent, le fondement de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal n'existe plus. Sans ce fondement, selon ce que pr\u00e9tend le Mus\u00e9e, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte est invalide et par cons\u00e9quent, par extension, le Tribunal n'a plus comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte.\nI. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [9] Les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate sont les suivantes :\nLa Commission a-t-elle retir\u00e9 le rapport Haignere et a-t-elle ainsi, dans les faits, retir\u00e9 la plainte? Les actions et les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des rapports ont-elles un effet sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'instruire la plainte?\n[10] Pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, j'estime que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces deux questions est non. Par cons\u00e9quent, je dois rejeter la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Mus\u00e9e.\nII. ANALYSE A. La Commission a-t-elle retir\u00e9 le rapport Haignere et a-t-elle ainsi, dans les faits, retir\u00e9 la plainte? [11] La pierre angulaire de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Mus\u00e9e en vue de faire rejeter la plainte est la pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle la Commission a retir\u00e9 le rapport Haignere. Toutefois, un examen du dossier ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucunement le retrait du rapport Haignere. Au cours d'une conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente affaire le 11 mai 2005, l'avocat de la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [traduction] la Commission n'appellera pas Lois Haignere comme t\u00e9moin. L'avocat de la Commission a de plus indiqu\u00e9 qu'il examinerait la possibilit\u00e9 d'appeler un autre expert comme t\u00e9moin lors de l'audience.\n[12] La Commission a par la suite engag\u00e9 Mme Nan Weiner pour qu'elle fournisse un rapport et t\u00e9moigne lors de l'audience. Le rapport de Mme Weiner a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9. La Commission a alors indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait l'intention d'appeler Mme Weiner pour t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 la place de Mme Haignere.\n[13] \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas appeler Mme Haignere comme t\u00e9moin au cours de l'audience ne constitue pas un retrait du rapport Haignere. Il s'agit simplement d'une d\u00e9cision prise par la Commission \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes qu'elle appellera et n'appellera pas comme t\u00e9moins lors de l'audience.\n[14] En tant que partie \u00e0 l'instruction, la Commission a le droit de rendre des d\u00e9cisions et d'adopter au cours de l'audience l'attitude qui, \u00e0 son avis, est la plus proche de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public (article 51 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne). De telles d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public sont \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion de la Commission. Cela inclut des d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la preuve que la Commission pr\u00e9sentera ou ne pr\u00e9sentera pas, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des arguments qu'elle pr\u00e9sentera et m\u00eame \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question de savoir si elle participera \u00e0 l'audience.\n[15] Il n'y a rien dans la Loi qui oblige la Commission, \u00e0 titre de partie \u00e0 l'instance devant le Tribunal, \u00e0 adopter des positions et \u00e0 rendre des d\u00e9cisions qui sont compatibles avec les conclusions de l'enqu\u00eateur ou avec d'autres rapports pr\u00e9par\u00e9s avant le renvoi de la plainte. L'instruction du Tribunal est une nouvelle proc\u00e9dure au cours de laquelle les parties sont libres d'adopter des positions et de rendre des d\u00e9cisions fond\u00e9es sur leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces positions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l'avance conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d'appeler Mme Weiner comme t\u00e9moin \u00e0 la place de Mme Haignere ne peut pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme un retrait implicite du rapport Haignere.\n[16] De plus, m\u00eame si on pouvait dire que le rapport Haignere a dans les faits \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 lorsque la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'appeler Mme Weiner comme t\u00e9moin \u00e0 la place de Mme Haignere, cela ne pourrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme signifiant que la Commission a retir\u00e9 la plainte.\n[17] La Commission n'a pas le pouvoir de retirer unilat\u00e9ralement une plainte une fois que le renvoi au Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9, et cela pour de nombreuses raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, le plaignant a un droit distinct de poursuivre la plainte ind\u00e9pendamment des actions prises par la Commission (voir la d\u00e9cision Premakumar c. Air Canada, [2002] D.C.D.P. no 17, au paragraphe 27 (TCDP), et la d\u00e9cision McKenzie Forest Products Inc. c. Ontario (Human Rights Commission) (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 150, au paragraphe 34 (C.A.)).\n[18] Comme le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9 c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant la G.R.C.), 2003 TCDP 32, au paragraphe 12, la plainte est celle de la plaignante, non celle de la Commission. Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame si la Commission d\u00e9cide de se retirer de l'instance, le plaignant a le droit de poursuivre l'audience et la d\u00e9cision de la Commission n'a pas d'effet sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Ainsi, les plaignants restent ma\u00eetres de l'exercice des droits qui leur sont garantis par la loi.\n[19] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la plaignante, l'AFPC, est clairement dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 poursuivre l'affaire ind\u00e9pendamment des actions et d\u00e9cisions de la Commission. L'AFPC d\u00e9clare qu'elle a engag\u00e9 un expert qui a analys\u00e9 le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois du Mus\u00e9e et qui a conclu qu'il y avait une preuve de l'existence d'aspects sexistes. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'AFPC insiste pour que le Tribunal remplisse son obligation pr\u00e9vue par le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi qui consiste \u00e0 donner aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations.\n[20] La r\u00e9ponse du Mus\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est que le pouvoir de la Commission de retirer la plainte est sujet au droit de l'AFPC de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate distincte pour \u00e9tablir son int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel \u00e0 poursuivre la plainte. Selon le Mus\u00e9e, si la plaignante peut s'opposer au retrait de la plainte en pr\u00e9sentant une requ\u00eate pour obtenir la permission du Tribunal de poursuivre la plainte, alors il n'y a pas d'incoh\u00e9rence entre l'obligation de la Commission de poursuivre l'examen initial des plaintes durant toute l'instruction et le droit de la plaignante d'\u00eatre entendue.\n[21] Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, le fait d'exiger que les plaignants pr\u00e9sentent une requ\u00eate pour d\u00e9fendre leur droit d'\u00eatre entendus par le Tribunal n'est clairement pas compatible avec les objectifs de la Loi. Une telle exigence imposerait un fardeau additionnel aux plaignants et pourrait tr\u00e8s bien avoir l'effet de les d\u00e9courager d'exercer leurs droits pr\u00e9vus par la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, les arguments du Mus\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s.\n[22] La deuxi\u00e8me raison pour laquelle la Commission n'a pas en fait une obligation de poursuivre l'examen initial des plaintes et de les retirer dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es apr\u00e8s le renvoi est que, apr\u00e8s le renvoi, il appartient au Tribunal, et non \u00e0 la Commission, de d\u00e9cider si la plainte est fond\u00e9e. Je conclus, comme l'a fait le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Premakumar, que l'analyse faite par la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario dans McKenzie Forest Products Inc. \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la fa\u00e7on dont sont trait\u00e9es les plaintes en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne dans le contexte ontarien est applicable dans la juridiction f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (d\u00e9cision Premakumar, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 27).\n[23] Une fois que la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer l'affaire au Tribunal pour qu'il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une instruction, son r\u00f4le de d\u00e9cideuse est termin\u00e9. Le Tribunal assume alors le pouvoir exclusif d'\u00e9tablir si la preuve appuie ou non la position du plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, apr\u00e8s que le renvoi a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9, la Commission ne peut pas r\u00e9examiner sa d\u00e9cision ni d\u00e9cider unilat\u00e9ralement de retirer la plainte parce que si elle agissait ainsi elle usurperait la fonction du Tribunal en tant qu'organisme juridictionnel dans le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne.\n[24] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, je refuse de suivre les remarques incidentes du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Kamani c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (1993), 23 C.H.R.R. D\/98, aux paragraphes 30 et 33, et dans la d\u00e9cision Sehmi c. Canada (VIA Rail), [1995] D.C.D.P. no 9, comme l'avocat du Mus\u00e9e me l'avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9. De plus, je ne suis pas d'avis que l'affaire Grover constitue une adh\u00e9sion par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 l'opinion selon laquelle la Commission a le pouvoir de retirer une plainte ou de r\u00e9examiner sa d\u00e9cision de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Grover, 2004 CF 704, au paragraphe 45). Il ressort clairement du contexte de cette affaire que lorsque la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a cit\u00e9 les commentaires faits par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Kamani, son but \u00e9tait de mettre en \u00e9vidence l'obligation de la Commission de faire avant le renvoi une enqu\u00eate soigneuse et approfondie.\n[25] En outre, je ne partage pas l'opinion du Mus\u00e9e selon laquelle l'affaire British Columbia (Police Complaint Commissioner) c. Vancouver (City) Police, 2003 BCSC 279, est applicable aux pr\u00e9sentes circonstances. Le contexte l\u00e9gislatif dans l'affaire de la Colombie-Britannique est diff\u00e9rent. Dans cette affaire, la cour a conclu que suivant la Police Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, ch. 367, le commissaire aux plaintes de la police \u00e9tait dans les faits le plaignant et, par cons\u00e9quent, avait le pouvoir de retirer unilat\u00e9ralement la plainte. La m\u00eame situation ne s'applique pas dans le contexte de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Suivant la Loi, le r\u00f4le de la Commission est clairement distinct de celui du plaignant. Le plaignant a le pouvoir de retirer unilat\u00e9ralement une plainte. Toutefois, la Commission n'a pas ce pouvoir.\nB. Les actions et les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des rapports ont-elles un effet sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'instruire la plainte? [26] \u00c0 mon avis, la communication du rapport Weiner apr\u00e8s le renvoi de la plainte n'a aucun effet que ce soit sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'instruire la plainte.\n[27] La Commission prend une d\u00e9cision de renvoyer une plainte au Tribunal sur le fondement des renseignements dont elle dispose au moment de la d\u00e9cision. Si une partie est d'avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est invalide, le seul recours est de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision. La Loi ne donne au Tribunal aucun pouvoir lui permettant de mettre en doute la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de lui renvoyer une plainte. Ce pouvoir fait partie du ressort exclusif de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. (International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Section maritime), Local 400 c. Oster, 2001 CFPI 1115, au paragraphe 29, et Tweten c. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., 2004 TCDP 8, au paragraphe 17.)\n[28] Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame si on pouvait dire que le rapport Weiner rempla\u00e7ait le rapport Haignere, le Tribunal ne pourrait pas rendre une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si une telle action rendrait invalide le renvoi. Le Tribunal est plut\u00f4t tenu de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'instruction de la plainte, sauf si une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est accueillie.\n[29] Le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que le pouvoir de la Commission pr\u00e9vu par la loi qui permet de demander une instruction est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 la plainte vis\u00e9e par le rapport (article 44 de la Loi). Par cons\u00e9quent, par extension, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte vis\u00e9e par le rapport. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le rapport dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire signifie dans les faits le rapport Haignere, et que la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas appeler comme t\u00e9moin l'auteure de ce rapport, le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour poursuivre l'affaire plus \u00e0 fond.\n[30] Les arguments du Mus\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard ne sont pas compatibles avec les d\u00e9clarations de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'arr\u00eat Bell Canada c. Syndicat canadien des communications, de l'\u00e9nergie et du papier, [1999] 1 C.F. 113, au paragraphe 37 (C.A.F.). Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour d'appel a statu\u00e9 que lorsqu'il instruit une plainte, le Tribunal n'est aucunement li\u00e9 par le rapport de l'enqu\u00eateur m\u00eame si la Commission adopte le rapport comme motifs de sa d\u00e9cision de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal. La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le Tribunal est un organisme autonome qui exerce ses fonctions juridictionnelles ind\u00e9pendamment de la Commission. Il s'ensuit que, m\u00eame si l'enqu\u00eateur a adopt\u00e9 le rapport Haignere et que la Commission s'est appuy\u00e9e sur ce rapport pour prendre sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal n'est pas li\u00e9 par ce rapport. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas appeler Mme Haignere comme t\u00e9moin au cours de l'audience n'a pas d'effet sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal.\n[31] J'estime que les motifs de la commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario dans l'affaire Shepherd c. Ontario Corp. 1110494 (2000), 38 C.H.R.R. D\/284, sont \u00e9clairants \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'effet qu'a un renvoi potentiellement invalide sur la comp\u00e9tence de la commission d'enqu\u00eate. Dans cette affaire, la Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne pr\u00e9tendait que, en raison d'une erreur proc\u00e9durale dans le processus de renvoi, sa d\u00e9cision de renvoyer la plainte \u00e9tait une nullit\u00e9. La commission d'enqu\u00eate refusait d'accepter cette pr\u00e9tention d\u00e9clarant que [traduction] le fait que la Commission d\u00e9crive son d\u00e9faut comme une nullit\u00e9 n'a pas pour effet de faire \u00e9chec \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence de la commission d'enqu\u00eate (Shepherd, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 13). La commission d'enqu\u00eate a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si elle mettait fin \u00e0 l'instruction et fermait le dossier dans cette affaire, cela aurait pour effet d'annuler l'obligation de tenir une audience \u00e0 laquelle elle \u00e9tait tenue par la loi (Shepherd, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 19).\n[32] \u00c0 mon avis, le m\u00eame raisonnement s'applique dans le contexte f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Une fois qu'un renvoi a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9, en l'absence de circonstances donnant lieu \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dures, la Loi requiert qu'il y ait une instruction de la plainte (voir le paragraphe 49(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et la d\u00e9cision Tweten, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 16). Il n'y a pas d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'il existe quelque circonstance donnant lieu \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dures dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, l'instruction de la plainte doit avoir lieu.\nIII. ORDONNANCE [34] Pour les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Mus\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nKaren A.

INTRODUCTION\nII. LES FAITS\nIII. LES PR\u00c9TENTIONS\nIV. L'ANALYSE\nV. LE DROIT\nVI. LA D\u00c9CISION\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision portant sur l'objection soulev\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 visant la pr\u00e9sentation par le plaignant d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du processus de s\u00e9lection ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Timothy Scott au poste de directeur, BMV.\nI. INTRODUCTION [2] L'intim\u00e9, Sant\u00e9 Canada, ci-apr\u00e8s nomm\u00e9 SC, s'oppose \u00e0 ce que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le plaignant dans la pr\u00e9sente instance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la nomination, en 1995, du Dr Timothy Scott au poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, ci-apr\u00e8s nomm\u00e9 le BMV. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que toute question se rapportant au processus de s\u00e9lection pour le poste de directeur du BMV a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure du Tribunal.\n[3] De plus, l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que toute question se rapportant \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Scott aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e au cours des audiences concernant la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra.\n[4] Au soutien de sa position, l'intim\u00e9 s'appuie sur la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e, sur la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e et sur l'abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[5] Quant \u00e0 lui, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qu'il veut mettre en preuve n'ont fait l'objet d'aucune d\u00e9cision par le Tribunal. Ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements se rapportent \u00e0 ce qui est survenu apr\u00e8s que des mesures correctives eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en application \u00e0 la fin de 1994 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du processus de s\u00e9lection se rapportant au poste de directeur, BMV.\n[6] Le Tribunal doit, pour statuer sur l'objection de l'intim\u00e9, d\u00e9crire les faits qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 l'objection de l'intim\u00e9.\nII. LES FAITS [7] Le 16 septembre 1992, le Dr Chopra a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Sa plainte a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Elle a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par une formation de trois membres instructeurs (la formation pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. Soberman) qui a rejet\u00e9 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le Dr Chopra.\n[8] Le dossier montre que, apr\u00e8s un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra a fait l'objet d'une deuxi\u00e8me audience devant le Tribunal. M. Hadjis fut d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de membre instructeur pour entendre l'affaire sur la base du dossier, auquel se sont ajout\u00e9s certains autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[9] Dans sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992, le Dr Chopra pr\u00e9tendait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 injustement en raison de la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle ses \u00e9valuations de rendement avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 1992. Il pr\u00e9tendait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 ainsi en raison de sa couleur, de sa race et de son origine nationale ou ethnique. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le Dr Chopra all\u00e9guait avoir fait l'objet de discrimination dans le processus de s\u00e9lection ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Claire Franklin au poste de directrice, Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments humains prescrits, ci-apr\u00e8s nomm\u00e9 le BMHP.\n[10] Au cours de l'audience pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. Hadjis, l'avocat de la Commission a mentionn\u00e9 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 1992. Un de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9tait la nomination, en d\u00e9cembre 1993, du Dr Timothy Scott au poste de directeur, BMV. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, selon ce qui ressort de la d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis, comme preuve de la discrimination continue \u00e0 SC (Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), [2001] D.C.D.P. no 20, au paragraphe 136, ci-apr\u00e8s nomm\u00e9e la d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis).\n[11] M\u00eame si cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement ne faisait pas partie des faits initiaux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra, M. Hadjis a trait\u00e9 du concours de d\u00e9cembre 1993 qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Scott (d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis, aux paragraphes 141 et suivants). Les faits ci-apr\u00e8s expos\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s par M. Hadjis.\n[12] En d\u00e9cembre 1993, SC a tenu un concours afin de doter le poste de directeur, BMV. Le Dr Chopra a pos\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 ce poste et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. Un autre individu, M. Casorso, qui avait \u00e9galement pos\u00e9 sa candidature, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi.\n[13] Le Dr Chopra et M. Casorso ont interjet\u00e9 appel de la nomination du Dr Scott au poste de directeur, BMV, aupr\u00e8s du Comit\u00e9 d'appel de la Commission de la fonction publique, ci-apr\u00e8s nomm\u00e9 le CACFP. L'appel du Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 alors que l'appel de M. Casorso a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le jury de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection n'avait pas correctement examin\u00e9 sa candidature en fonction des exigences d'exp\u00e9rience qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies par le minist\u00e8re pour ce poste.\n[14] \u00c0 la suite de la d\u00e9cision du CACFP, SC a pris des mesures correctives pour mettre en application la d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 d'appel dans l'affaire Casorso \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du processus de s\u00e9lection pour le poste de directeur, BMV.\n[15] Le crit\u00e8re exigeant une exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente dans la gestion d'un organisme scientifique, m\u00e9dical ou v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire dont les programmes sont polyvalents a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9. En outre, SC a ordonn\u00e9 que des candidats qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient aucune exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant d'un minist\u00e8re aupr\u00e8s d'organismes ext\u00e9rieurs ou aucune exp\u00e9rience en gestion devraient faire l'objet d'une nouvelle \u00e9valuation.\n[16] Par cons\u00e9quent, un nouveau concours a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu et \u00e0 la fin du processus, le 28 f\u00e9vrier 1995, la nomination du Dr Scott au poste de directeur, BMV, a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e, avec effet le 13 mars 1995.\nIII. LES PR\u00c9TENTIONS [17] L'avocat du plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu'apr\u00e8s la mise en application des mesures correctives, survenue apr\u00e8s que M. Casorso ait eu gain de cause, la candidature du Dr Chopra au poste de directeur, BMV, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e et, en fait, n'a aucunement \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en compte. Selon l'avocat du plaignant, ce fait appuyait la pr\u00e9tention du Dr Chopra selon laquelle il y avait eu de la discrimination exerc\u00e9e \u00e0 son endroit.\n[18] L'avocat du plaignant pr\u00e9tend en outre que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s la mise en application des mesures correctives sont des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s par M. Hadjis dans sa d\u00e9cision et qu'ils devraient ainsi faire partie des questions \u00e0 trancher par le Tribunal dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. L'avocat du plaignant, cependant, a reconnu que les conclusions de M. Hadjis \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du concours de 1993 pour le poste de directeur, BMV, devraient \u00eatre maintenues.\n[19] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend, au contraire, que la d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis traite de tous les aspects du concours de 1993 qui a conduit \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Scott au poste de directeur, BMV. Il se fonde sur la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e, sur la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e et sur l'abus de proc\u00e9dure pour appuyer sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle le Tribunal ne devrait pas entendre la preuve se rapportant \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Scott.\n[20] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend de plus que le Dr Chopra aurait pu se plaindre du fait que sa candidature n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en compte pour le deuxi\u00e8me concours tenu \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du poste de directeur, BMV, au cours des audiences portant sur sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992.\n[21] Premi\u00e8rement, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 souligne le fait que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par la formation pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. Soberman en septembre et en octobre 1995, longtemps apr\u00e8s la nomination du Dr. Scott au poste de directeur, BMV, en f\u00e9vrier 1995. Deuxi\u00e8mement, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que la question aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre pleinement d\u00e9battue devant M. Hadjis lorsque, en 1999 et 2000, il a entendu la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra.\n[22] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que le fait de permettre ou d'autoriser le d\u00e9bat de cette question, c'est-\u00e0-dire le fait que la candidature du Dr Chopra n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en compte lors du deuxi\u00e8me concours tenu \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du poste de directeur, BMV, constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nIV. L'ANALYSE [23] La premi\u00e8re audience tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra devant la formation pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. Soberman a eu lieu en septembre et en octobre 1995. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que toute question de discrimination se rapportant \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Scott aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre trait\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment.\n[24] Ce point de vue ne tient pas compte du fait que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e traiter des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus durant la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 1992, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ceux se rapportant \u00e0 la dotation du poste de directeur, BMHP, entre le mois de septembre 1990 et le printemps 1992 (d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis, au paragraphe 2). Ce n'est que durant l'audience pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. Hadjis, tenue du 17 mai 1999 au 11 d\u00e9cembre 2000, que la question du concours se rapportant \u00e0 la dotation du poste de directeur, BMV, en d\u00e9cembre 1993, a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e comme un fait additionnel devant \u00eatre examin\u00e9 par M. Hadjis.\n[25] Il importe de noter ici que, dans sa d\u00e9cision, M. Hadjis mentionne le fait qu'au cours des observations finales pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es lors de la nouvelle audition de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra, il y a eu un certain d\u00e9bat entre les avocats \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des param\u00e8tres de l'instruction de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'une grande partie de la preuve fournie par la Commission lors de la nouvelle audience portait sur des questions qui allaient au-del\u00e0 des questions abord\u00e9es express\u00e9ment dans la plainte (d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis, au paragraphe 254).\n[26] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail les observations de toutes les parties, y compris celles du Dr Chopra lui-m\u00eame, M. Hadjis a conclu qu'il pouvait appr\u00e9cier toute la preuve pour sa valeur \u00e0 titre de preuve circonstancielle fournie au soutien de l'aspect cl\u00e9 de la plainte, c'est-\u00e0-dire la dotation du poste de directeur du BMHP, au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 1992 (d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis, au paragraphe 254). Plus t\u00f4t dans sa d\u00e9cision, M. Hadjis avait \u00e9tabli que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus durant la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 1992 \u00e9taient les \u00e9v\u00e9nements au cur de la plainte du Dr Chopra (d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis, au paragraphe 82).\n[27] Il appert, par cons\u00e9quent, que c'est la dotation du poste de directeur BMHP qui \u00e9tait au cur de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra et que la preuve additionnelle qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e9tait de la preuve circonstancielle fournie au soutien de l'aspect cl\u00e9 de la plainte, c'est-\u00e0-dire la dotation du poste de directeur, BMHP. Il appert donc que le concours de 1993 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capital dans l'instance devant M. Hadjis (voir la d\u00e9cision Joss c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1999] A.C.F. no 1819 (QL) (1re inst.)).\n[28] Cela dit, le Tribunal ne peut cependant pas omettre de tenir compte du fait que M. Hadjis dans sa d\u00e9cision a effectivement tir\u00e9 des conclusions de fait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations de discrimination se rapportant \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus \u00e0 un moment autre que durant la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 1992, \u00e0 savoir la nomination du Dr Scott au poste de directeur, BMV.\n[29] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, M. Hadjis a conclu que le Dr Chopra n'avait pas fait l'objet d'un traitement qui l'avait d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 dans le cadre du concours de d\u00e9cembre 1993 visant \u00e0 doter le poste de directeur, BMV. M. Hadjis a, en outre, conclu qu'il n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni aucune preuve indiquant que le Dr Chopra avait, en fait, l'exp\u00e9rience requise pour traiter avec des organismes externes (d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis, au paragraphe 288). Sur cette base, M. Hadjis a conclu que le Dr. Chopra n'avait pas les comp\u00e9tences requises pour occuper le poste et qu'il n'y avait aucune preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[30] M\u00eame si on peut dire que ces conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es par M. Hadjis ne sont qu'accessoires \u00e0 la question fondamentale qu'il devait trancher, c'est-\u00e0-dire la dotation du poste de directeur, BMHP, je ne peux omettre d'en tenir compte.\n[31] Dans une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire se rapportant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance, M. Groarke, membre instructeur du Tribunal, a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que le d\u00e9faut all\u00e9gu\u00e9 d'avoir nomm\u00e9 le Dr Chopra au poste de directeur en 1993 avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l'objet d'un d\u00e9bat. Sur ce point, M. Groake a mentionn\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve se rapportant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus entre 1992 et 1994 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Hadjis et il a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que cette preuve, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission pour le compte du Dr Chopra, faisait clairement partie de la preuve du Dr Chopra.\n[32] M\u00eame si ces d\u00e9clarations peuvent \u00eatre exactes, je ne peux pas inf\u00e9rer de la d\u00e9cision de M. Groarke que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision rendue par le CACFP \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'appel de M. Casorso font partie de la d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis.\n[33] Le Tribunal conclut par cons\u00e9quent ce qui suit :\nLa p\u00e9riode trait\u00e9e par la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra \u00e9tait la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 1992, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment jusqu'au 16 septembre 1992, date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\nLa dotation du poste de directeur, BMHP, \u00e9tait au cur de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992.\nDes all\u00e9gations additionnelles de discrimination ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es au cours de la deuxi\u00e8me audience tenue par M. Hadjis \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992, notamment des all\u00e9gations de discrimination se rapportant au processus de s\u00e9lection de d\u00e9cembre 1993 qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la nomination du Dr Scott au poste de directeur, BMV.\nCes all\u00e9gations, m\u00eame si elles \u00e9taient accessoires et ne faisaient pas partie de la port\u00e9e de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992, ont amen\u00e9 M. Hadjis \u00e0 tirer certaines conclusions de fait.\nLe Tribunal ne peut pas omettre de tenir compte de ces conclusions, mais elles doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es dans le contexte de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 et de l'analyse effectu\u00e9e par M. Hadjis \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du concours de d\u00e9cembre 1993.\n[34] Dans son analyse de la preuve se rapportant au concours de 1993 (d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis, aux paragraphes 141 et 142), M. Hadjis a pris en compte seulement les faits se rapportant au concours initial. Il n'a pas trait\u00e9 des mesures correctives qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en application apr\u00e8s que M. Casorso eut gain de cause dans son appel. Il n'a pas trait\u00e9 non plus des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s la mise en application de ces mesures correctives ni de toute all\u00e9gation de discrimination se rapportant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont suivi la mise en application des mesures correctives.\n[35] Le Tribunal conclut, par cons\u00e9quent, que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s qu'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue la d\u00e9cision du CACFP en novembre 1994 n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en compte par M. Hadjis et que ce dernier n'a pas rendu une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Ses conclusions de fait se limitent au concours initial de 1993 et ne traitent pas de l'ensemble du processus se rapportant \u00e0 la dotation du poste de directeur, BMV.\n[36] Sur ce point, le Tribunal ne souscrit pas \u00e0 l'affirmation de l'intim\u00e9 selon laquelle les mesures correctives mises en application apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision Casorso sont incluses dans l'ensemble du processus de s\u00e9lection d'un directeur du BMV, processus qui a d\u00e9but\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 1993 et qui s'est termin\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 1995 par la confirmation du Dr Scott au poste de directeur, BMV.\nV. LE DROIT [37] Appliquant \u00e0 ces conclusions le droit en mati\u00e8re de chose jug\u00e9e et de pr\u00e9clusion d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e (voir l'arr\u00eat Angle c. Canada (Ministre du Revenu national), [1975] 2 R.C.S. 248, QL, \u00e0 la page 4), le Tribunal conclut ce qui suit :\nIl n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait au premier crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par Lord Guest dans Carl Zeiss Stiftung, comme mentionn\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Angle, c'est-\u00e0-dire au crit\u00e8re voulant que la m\u00eame question soulev\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente instance ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par un autre tribunal;\nles questions se rapportant \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de discrimination soulev\u00e9es apr\u00e8s que le CACFP eut rendu sa d\u00e9cision en novembre 1994 n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par M. Hadjis;\non ne peut pas inf\u00e9rer que ces questions sont incluses dans les conclusions de M. Hadjis \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du concours initial se rapportant \u00e0 la s\u00e9lection d'un directeur, BMV;\nil n'y a pas d'abus de proc\u00e9dure de la part du plaignant.\n[38] M\u00eame si j'avais tir\u00e9 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente, c'est-\u00e0-dire m\u00eame si j'avais conclu que les trois conditions d'application de la pr\u00e9clusion d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e \u00e9taient remplies, j'aurais refus\u00e9, en exer\u00e7ant mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire (arr\u00eat Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., [2001] 2 R.C.S. 460 (QL), au paragraphe 13), d'appliquer la pr\u00e9clusion d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e compte tenu du fait que le concours de 1993 et le concours subs\u00e9quent se rapportant \u00e0 la nomination du directeur, BMV, n'\u00e9taient pas au cur de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992 par le Dr Chopra, et du fait que le concours de 1993 a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en preuve, comme l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Hadjis dans sa d\u00e9cision, au soutien de l'aspect cl\u00e9 de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1992, c'est-\u00e0-dire la dotation du poste de directeur, BMHP, durant la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 1992 (d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis, au paragraphe 254).\nVI.

LA PLAINTE [1] Le plaignant, Richard Warman, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue que, en 2001 et 2002, les intim\u00e9s, Alexan Kulbashian et James Scott Richardson, ont communiqu\u00e9 sur Internet des messages susceptibles d'exposer des individus qui ne sont pas des chr\u00e9tiens, qui ne sont pas de race blanche ou qui sont des individus d'autres origines nationales ethniques, \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, en contravention de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Dans son formulaire de plainte, M. Warman a nomm\u00e9 trois autres intim\u00e9s, \u00e0 savoir : Tri-City Skins.com, Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (CECT) et Affordable Space.com.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission) a particip\u00e9 pleinement \u00e0 l'audience tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte et elle \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une avocate. Ni M. Warman ni les intim\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un avocat, bien qu'il faille noter que M. Warman est avocat. M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents lors de l'audience, mais ni l'un ni l'autre n'a choisi de t\u00e9moigner ou d'appeler des t\u00e9moins apr\u00e8s que la Commission et le plaignant eurent termin\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation de leur preuve. M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve certains documents au cours de leurs contre-interrogatoires des t\u00e9moins de la Commission.\n[3] Les trois autres intim\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s n'ont pas comparu officiellement lors de l'audience, m\u00eame si M. Warman et la Commission pr\u00e9tendent que M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson sont \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s \u00e0 ces intim\u00e9s. Je traiterai de cette question en temps utile, plus loin dans la d\u00e9cision.\nII. LES CIRCONSTANCES QUI ONT DONN\u00c9 LIEU \u00c0 LA PR\u00c9SENTE PLAINTE [4] M. Warman est un r\u00e9sident d'Ottawa. Il a manifest\u00e9 un int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les questions se rapportant aux droits de la personne au cours des 15 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es et il joue un r\u00f4le actif au sein de groupes contre le racisme. Il a pendant un certain temps travaill\u00e9 pour la Commission. Plus r\u00e9cemment, il a concentr\u00e9 son attention sur la propagande haineuse diffus\u00e9e sur Internet en surveillant les activit\u00e9s qu'ont sur Internet des groupes qu'il d\u00e9crit comme des groupes extr\u00e9mistes de droite et des groupes n\u00e9onazis.\n[5] En 2001, M. Warman a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 surveiller les sites Web de deux groupes, le groupe Tri-City Skins et le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, lesquels \u00e9taient soi-disant tous deux situ\u00e9s dans le sud-ouest de l'Ontario. Selon M. Warman, les sites Web de ces groupes \u00e9taient respectivement le Tri-cityskins.com et le wpcect.com (une abr\u00e9viation pour White Power - Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team). Apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 certaines recherches, M. Warman a de plus \u00e9tabli que ces deux sites Web \u00e9taient accessibles sur Internet par l'interm\u00e9diaire de services d'h\u00e9bergement Web fournis par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e, Affordable Space.com.. Il croyait de plus que M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson participaient tous deux \u00e0 l'exploitation des sites Tri-cityskins.com, wpcect.com et Affordable Space.com. Selon M. Warman, la documentation figurant sur les sites Web contrevenait \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi. Il a donc d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2002.\n[6] Les sites Web en cause n'\u00e9taient plus accessibles sur Internet au moment de l'audience tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte.\nIII. LES QUESTIONS QUI DOIVENT \u00caTRE TRAIT\u00c9ES DANS LA PR\u00c9SENTE AFFAIRE [7] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je dois traiter des questions suivantes :\nLa documentation transmise sur Internet est-elle une communication au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi? Quelle \u00e9tait la documentation figurant sur Internet qui, selon ce qu'all\u00e8gue M. Warman, contrevient \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi? Cette documentation \u00e9tait-elle susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite? M. Kulbashian ou M. Richardson, agissant seul ou agissant d'un commun accord l'un avec l'autre ou avec d'autres personnes, ont-ils communiqu\u00e9 ou fait communiquer cette documentation de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e? La plainte est-elle fond\u00e9e contre les autres intim\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s (Tri-City Skins.com, Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (CECT) et Affordable Space.com)?\n[8] Comme je l'explique dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j'estime que la documentation en cause constitue de la propagande haineuse au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi et que M. Richardson de m\u00eame que M. Kulbashian et sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Affordable Space.com, ont particip\u00e9 de diverses mani\u00e8res \u00e0 la communication de cette propagande. J'estime en outre que le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team est un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord qui \u00e9tait responsable de la transmission d'une certaine partie de cette propagande, contrevenant ainsi \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'article 13. Par contre, il n'existe aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant que tri-cityskins.com \u00e9tait autre chose qu'un nom de site Web. Ce n'est pas une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord au sens de l'article 13. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la plainte contre l'intim\u00e9 connu sous le nom de Tri-City Skins.com n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nA. Premi\u00e8re question - La documentation transmise sur Internet est-elle une communication au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi? [9] L'article 13 a initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 bien avant l'envahissante croissance mondiale d'Internet, et la disposition elle-m\u00eame ne mentionnait aucunement Internet. En 2001, cependant, le paragraphe 13(2) a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 par l'article 88 de la Loi antiterroriste, L.C. 2001, ch. 41, afin de pr\u00e9voir qu'il demeure entendu, que l'acte discriminatoire interdit s'\u00e9tendait \u00e0 l'utilisation d'un ordinateur, d'un ensemble d'ordinateurs connect\u00e9s ou reli\u00e9s les uns aux autres, notamment d'Internet. Cette modification est entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2001 (C.P. 2001-2425, TR\/2002-16, Gazette du Canada, Partie II, vol. 136, no 1).\n[10] M. Warman a vu sur Internet la documentation qui fait l'objet de sa plainte, en 2001 et 2002, avant et apr\u00e8s l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la modification de l'article 13. Cependant, comme le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18, 43 C.H.R.R D\/425 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 15, (Kyburz), il n'importe pas en fin de compte de savoir si les messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s avant que la Loi soit modifi\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a conclu que la version ant\u00e9rieure de l'article 13 s'appliquait aux communications Internet tant dans la d\u00e9cision Citron c. Z\u00fcndel (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/274 (T.C.D.P.), que dans la d\u00e9cision Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Meprizer Inc. et al. (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/453 (T.C.D.P.). \u00c0 mon avis, la question est maintenant r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. L'article 13 de la Loi s'applique \u00e0 l'utilisation d'Internet, que ce soit avant ou apr\u00e8s les modifications.\nB. La deuxi\u00e8me question - Quelle est la documentation figurant sur Internet qui, selon ce qui est all\u00e9gu\u00e9, contrevient \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi? (i) La documentation figurant sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com [11] La Commission a fourni des copies de pages Web tri-cityskins.com que M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir vues entre octobre 2001 et f\u00e9vrier 2002. L'adresse Internet de la page d'accueil \u00e9tait www.tri-cityskins.com. Une copie de la page d'accueil, imprim\u00e9e le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2002, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve.\n[12] Dans le haut de la page, il y a un message d'accueil qui \u00e9nonce ce qui suit : [traduction] Le site Web de Tri-City Skins est DE RETOUR. Il y a ensuite l'avertissement suivant : [traduction] Il y a dans ces pages des points de vue que de nombreuses personnes trouveront offensants. ON S'EN FOUT!!!. M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en cliquant sur le mot enter au bas de la page il a \u00e9t\u00e9 redirig\u00e9 \u00e0 la page principale. Un message dans le haut de la page principale disait ce qui suit : [traduction] Tri-City Skins - Bienvenue sur notre site Web officiel. Entre deux drapeaux canadiens, le mot Skinheads appara\u00eet, pr\u00e8s du haut. Sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche de la page il y a une colonne d'ic\u00f4nes (ou liens) qui dirigent le visiteur vers d'autres parties du site Web apr\u00e8s qu'il a cliqu\u00e9 sur l'un de ces liens. L'un de ces liens amenait dans une partie du site Web qui fournissait elle-m\u00eame des liens \u00e0 des Good Sites, qui incluaient les sites du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, des Skinheads de Toronto, d'Heritage Front et de la White Aryan Resistance. Il y a \u00e9galement un lien \u00e0 un site nomm\u00e9 www.whitesonly.net. L'ic\u00f4ne qui dirigeait vers ce site consistait en une corde avec un nud coulant \u00e0 chaque extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 avec la phrase : [traduction] Apportez votre n\u00e8gre... Nous avons la corde.\n[13] Une autre page sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com, qui \u00e9tait accessible en cliquant sur un lien sur la page principale, est intitul\u00e9e [traduction] [...] du mois. Cette page li\u00e9e pr\u00e9sente les chansons, les citations, les sites, les blagues et les photographies en vedette au cours du mois. La blague du mois en d\u00e9cembre 2001 \u00e9tait la suivante :\n[traduction]\nComment appelle-t-on 6 n\u00e8gres qui pendent d'un arbre?\nUn carillon d'Alabama.\n[14] La photographie du mois consistait en deux photographies : une photographie d'un homme portant une sorte de turban, accompagn\u00e9e de la description suivante : [traduction] C'est un sikh, et une autre photographie, cette fois celle d'un homme portant une barbe transportant un animal de la ferme, qui portait \u00e9galement une coiffure similaire, avec la description suivante : [traduction] C'est un musulman. Les deux photographies \u00e9taient suivies de la l\u00e9gende suivante :\n[traduction]\nVeuillez battre en cons\u00e9quence.\nPr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la fondation Ne battez pas un sikh.\n[15] Le site Web tri-cityskins.com contenait plusieurs pages consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 des blagues, intitul\u00e9es [traduction] Blagues de n\u00e8gres, Blagues de Juifs et Autres blagues ethniques. Toutes ces blagues \u00e9taient accessibles en cliquant sur le lien Joke Page \u00e0 partir de la page principale. La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des copies de pages qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vues et imprim\u00e9es par M. Warman le 13 octobre 2001. On trouve de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments affich\u00e9s sur ces pages. Les blagues qui suivent sont seulement quelques exemples des blagues qu'on trouve sur la page [traduction] Blagues de n\u00e8gres :\nTraduction]\nQ : Qu'est-ce qui a quatre pattes poilues et un bras noir?\nR. : Un pit-bull heureux.\nQ : Pourquoi les yeux d'un n\u00e8gre sont-ils rouges apr\u00e8s une relation sexuelle?\nR : \u00c0 cause du gaz incapacitant.\nQ : Qu'est-ce qui manque dans la file de sans emploi \u00e0 Harlem?\nR : Cent pieds de cha\u00eene et un encanteur.\nLa page de [traduction] Blagues de Juifs contient \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 25 \u00e9l\u00e9ments affich\u00e9s dont les premiers sont les suivants :\n[traduction]\nQ : Quelle est la meilleure chose qui est sortie d'Auschwitz?\nR : Un train vide.\nQ : Qu'est-ce que l'enfant allemand recevait pour No\u00ebl?\nR : Un G.I. Jew et un four easy bake.\nQ : Comment fait-on entrer 100 Juifs dans une Volkswagen?\nR : Deux \u00e0 l'avant, trois \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re et 95 dans le cendrier.\nQ : Quelle est la diff\u00e9rence entre un Juif et une tarte aux pommes?\nR : Une tarte aux pommes ne crie pas quand tu la mets dans le four.\nLa page [traduction] Autres blagues ethniques se rapporte \u00e0 des personnes de diverses ethnies. Les blagues suivantes sont un exemple :\n[traduction]\nQ : Quel est le jour le plus m\u00ealant sur une r\u00e9serve indienne?\nR : Le jour de la f\u00eate des p\u00e8res.\nQ : Pourquoi le Mexique n'a-t-il pas une bonne \u00e9quipe olympique?\nR : Quiconque peut courir, sauter ou nager est d\u00e9j\u00e0 aux \u00c9.-U.\nQ : Pourquoi les Pakistanais puent-ils?\nR : Pour que les aveugles les ha\u00efssent \u00e9galement.\n[16] Il y avait sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com une autre page qui \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9e pour annoncer des White Power, Racist, and Skinhead Shirts (chemises du White Power, des chemises \u00e0 messages racistes et des chemises Skinhead). Il y avait des instructions quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle ces chemises pouvaient \u00eatre command\u00e9es et les grandeurs disponibles \u00e9taient indiqu\u00e9es. Les chemises montr\u00e9es portaient \u00e0 l'avant des inscriptions dont : Aryan (Aryen), ACAB - ALL COPS ARE BASTARDS (tous les policiers sont des salauds), SKINHEADS et Aryan Women Unite (les femmes aryennes s'unissent).\n[17] On trouvait aussi sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com une page intitul\u00e9e HEROES AND WARRIORS OF OUR MOVEMENT (H\u00e9ros et guerriers de notre mouvement). Une copie de cette page imprim\u00e9e le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2001 contient, entre autres, des photographies d'Adolf Hitler, de Rudolf Hess et d'Ernst Z\u00fcndel. Dans les marges lat\u00e9rales, il y a le symbole nazi SS et une croix de fer avec un svastika au centre.\n[18] Il y a sur la page principale du site Web tri-cityskins.com un lien intitul\u00e9 Weekly A.D.V. Broadcast - updated (mise \u00e0 jour de la diffusion hebdomadaire A.D.V.). M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en cliquant sur l'ic\u00f4ne, on obtenait une page du site Web tri-cityskins.com sur laquelle figurait le texte de la diffusion hebdomadaire American Dissident Voices. Il a fourni des copies imprim\u00e9es des pages de cinq parutions de cette diffusion qui \u00e9taient affich\u00e9es sur la page Web, entre ao\u00fbt 2001 et f\u00e9vrier 2002. Chaque diffusion consistait en un article passablement long (8 \u00e0 13 pages) soi-disant r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par William Pierce qui, selon M. Warman, dirigeait la National Alliance, le plus grand groupe n\u00e9onazi aux \u00c9tats-Unis \u00e0 ce moment.\n[19] Dans une diffusion, M. Pierce informe les citoyens blancs d'Afrique du Sud que la [traduction] seule solution viable \u00e0 long terme pour [eux] consiste \u00e0 se d\u00e9barrasser de tous les Noirs et de tous ceux qui ne sont pas de race blanche. Ils devraient [traduction] les forcer \u00e0 partir, les st\u00e9riliser, les tuer - sinon [ils] perdront [leur] pays. Il affirme ensuite ce qui suit dans cet article :\n[traduction]\nSi nous voulons que notre race survive sur cette plan\u00e8te plus longtemps qu'une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration ou deux, alors nous devons remettre nos id\u00e9es en place et effacer de nos esprits la superstition chr\u00e9tienne et la propagande juive et faire face aux faits sans \u00eatre d\u00e9licats. Un fait est que nous devons avoir la possession exclusive de ces portions de cette plan\u00e8te qui constituent un habitat convenable pour nous. Un autre fait est que pour obtenir et maintenir cette possession exclusive, nous devons \u00eatre pr\u00eats \u00e0 tuer et \u00e0 annihiler tous les comp\u00e9titeurs. Un troisi\u00e8me fait est que le racisme est le cadeau de Dieu \u00e0 toute race qui veut survivre. Le racisme est sain et naturel et essentiel, et il serait beaucoup mieux que nous effacions de nos esprits le mensonge jud\u00e9o-chr\u00e9tien voulant que le racisme soit r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible et m\u00e9chant et vilain et primaire.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[20] Dans une autre diffusion, que M. Warman a vue et imprim\u00e9e le 13 octobre 2001, M. Pierce d\u00e9crit l'administration Clinton comme [traduction] le gouvernement le plus juif que l'Am\u00e9rique ait jamais eu, qu'il compare ensuite de la fa\u00e7on suivante avec l'administration de George W. Bush :\n[traduction]\nLes gens que le public voit sont des Gentils - d'une certaine sorte : un secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat mul\u00e2tre, un secr\u00e9taire de la D\u00e9fense gentil blanc, une Noire comme conseiller de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, un secr\u00e9taire du Tr\u00e9sor gentil blanc - et, sauf pour le pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9serve f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Alan Greenspan, ne sont pas des Juifs en vue. C'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il y a peu de Juifs en premi\u00e8re ligne, o\u00f9 on peut les voir. Mais les Juifs sont l\u00e0, tout comme dans le gouvernement Clinton, et ils travaillent dans les coulisses.\n[21] Dans une diffusion subs\u00e9quente que M. Warman a vue le 22 janvier 2002, intitul\u00e9e The Culture of Lies, M. Pierce rejette ce qu'il dit \u00eatre [traduction] le soi-disant Holocauste, et le [traduction] mythe central de six millions de Juifs innocents et sans reproche tu\u00e9s dans des fours \u00e0 gaz par les m\u00e9chants nazis. Il termine l'article en \u00e9crivant sur la question du contr\u00f4le des m\u00e9dias par les Juifs en Am\u00e9rique qui permet que [traduction] l'habitude de mentir pr\u00e9domine.\n[22] Une autre diffusion, dont M. Warman a pris connaissance le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2002, mentionnait le professeur de droit de l'Universit\u00e9 Harvard, Alan Dershowitz. M. Pierce a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nFondamentalement, il n'est pas un avocat ou un libertaire civil; il n'est pas un Am\u00e9ricain; il n'est m\u00eame pas un \u00eatre humain semblable. Alan Dershowitz est un Juif et cela dit tout.\n[23] L'article se poursuit en critiquant la position de M. Dershowitz, qui serait soi-disant pour l'utilisation de la torture par le gouvernement am\u00e9ricain pour obtenir des confessions \u00e0 la suite des attaques du 11 septembre, en d\u00e9clarant ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nMais je vous assure qu'en fin de compte, ce ne sont pas seulement les musulmans que Dershowitz et sa tribu ont en t\u00eate lorsqu'ils pr\u00e9conisent la torture; c'est vous et moi; c'est quiconque se met en travers du chemin de la supr\u00e9matie totale de la tribu.\n(ii) La documentation figurant sur le site Web wpcect.com a) La page Links (liens) [24] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal certains extraits du site Web wpcect.com, notamment une copie de la page Links, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 imprim\u00e9e le 18 janvier 2002. Le message qui appara\u00eet d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre de la page Links est : C.E.C.T., un acronyme pour le nom Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. \u00c0 la gauche de cette page, il y a un logo qui consiste en une moiti\u00e9 de feuille d'\u00e9rable et une moiti\u00e9 de croix celtique. Sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit de la page, il y a un autre logo, qui n'est que partiellement visible sur la copie imprim\u00e9e, mais qui ressemble \u00e0 une feuille d'\u00e9rable en surimpression sur un svastika.\n[25] Sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche de la page, il y a une colonne contenant les mots suivants : Start, News, Articles, Thoughts, Info, Flyers, Webhosting, Chapters, Newsletter, Contact et Links. M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que cette colonne se trouvait sur toutes les pages du site wpcect.com. En cliquant sur les mots, une page correspondante s'ouvrait. Par exemple, en cliquant sur le mot Links \u00e0 partir de n'importe quelle page sur le site Web, on arrivait \u00e0 la page Links qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve.\n[26] Plus bas au centre de cette page Links, il y a une s\u00e9rie d'ic\u00f4nes qui, lorsqu'on clique dessus, vous am\u00e8nent \u00e0 leurs sites Web. Ces sites li\u00e9s incluent le site tri-cityskins.com, le site de la White Aryan Resistance, de l'American Nazi Party, du National Skinhead Front (whitevictory.com) et le site hatecore88.com. M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le num\u00e9ro 88 est souvent utilis\u00e9 par des groupes n\u00e9onazis. La lettre H est la 8e lettre de l'alphabet et le num\u00e9ro 88 (signifiant HH) renvoie aux premi\u00e8res lettres des mots de la phrase Heil Hitler. Au-dessus de tous les ic\u00f4nes, il y a un titre qui explique que ces sites Web li\u00e9s sont des [traduction] Domaines que nous h\u00e9bergeons sans frais.\nb) La page Thoughts (r\u00e9flexions) [27] M. Warman a fourni une copie imprim\u00e9e d'un article intitul\u00e9 Intro to Racial Woes. Il avait ant\u00e9rieurement vu cet article en cliquant sur la l\u00e9gende identifi\u00e9e par le mot Thoughts qui se trouvait sur la colonne de gauche du site Web wpcect.com. Sur la copie imprim\u00e9e qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e lors de l'audience, la moiti\u00e9 de la date avait \u00e9t\u00e9 coup\u00e9e, mais M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait vu et imprim\u00e9 le texte le 13 octobre 2001. Le texte contient le passage suivant, qui se rapporte aux politiques en mati\u00e8re d'immigration au Canada :\n[traduction]\nPlus de 35 pour 100 des \u00e9trangers ill\u00e9gaux sont des individus qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s coupables d'actes criminels ou qui sont recherch\u00e9s pour de tels actes. Vous voyez, maintenant au Canada nous ne faisons pas de v\u00e9rifications quant aux ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de nos \u00e9ventuels citoyens qui pourraient \u00eatre admis. Pour une certaine raison \u00e9trange, nous les laissons simplement entrer au pays suivant le syst\u00e8me fond\u00e9 sur l'honneur. Nous leur donnons toutes les possibilit\u00e9s du monde et nous ne faisons simplement rien en esp\u00e9rant qu'aucun de ces rejets du tiers-monde ne commettra de crimes violents comme des viols, des meurtres et m\u00eame des actes de terrorisme. Non seulement les Noirs et les Asiatiques polluent-ils nos villes avec des gangs et de la drogue, mais de plus ils couchent avec nos femmes et font tout ce qu'ils peuvent pour s'assurer, au moyen de la procr\u00e9ation interraciale, que la race blanche n'existe pas. Ils sont suivis par des adolescents blancs qui \u00e0 cause des m\u00e9dias pensent que c'est g\u00e9nial d'\u00eatre un Noir. Ces wiggers (des jeunes blancs qui veulent \u00eatre noirs), que je nomme des tra\u00eetres \u00e0 notre race, ne savent aucunement qu'ils font simplement partie du plan qui a pour seul but d'exterminer la race blanche.\nLes m\u00e9dias juifs, qui contr\u00f4lent tout ce que nous voyons et entendons \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et \u00e0 la radio, dirigent cette guerre contre nous. Quand, en tant que race unie, apprendrons-nous notre le\u00e7on? En raison des r\u00e9cents \u00e9v\u00e9nements quant aux probl\u00e8mes terroristes du mill\u00e9naire, je ne pense pas que j'ai besoin de dire quoi que ce soit \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des ressortissants des Indes orientales. Ils sont d\u00e9go\u00fbtants et sont seulement mauvais pour un jeune pays comme le n\u00f4tre. Si nous continuons \u00e0 laisser tous ces \u00e9trangers entrer au Canada, ne soyez pas surpris si un jour le Canada n'est pas connu pour sa grande qualit\u00e9 de vie et sa beaut\u00e9, mais si plut\u00f4t il est connu comme un pays qui aide et assiste des criminels, et un endroit o\u00f9 les violeurs et les meurtriers peuvent se soustraire aux lois de leur propre pays. Attendez un instant. C'est ce qui se passe d\u00e9j\u00e0.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\nL'article se termine par la d\u00e9claration suivante :\n[traduction]\n[...] Qu'\u00eates-vous pr\u00eats \u00e0 faire pour votre pays et la fi\u00e8re race blanche? Moi, personnellement, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 aller \u00e0 fond et \u00e0 faire tout ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire que je fasse pour m'assurer que la race blanche domine, comme je suis certain que nous dominerons.\nLe texte est sign\u00e9 comme suit :\nWhite Pride Worldwide 14\/88\n-WHITE POWER CANADA: THE REICH WAY!\nc) Le bulletin d'information - Vinland Voice [28] Un autre des mots qu'on retrouve sur la colonne gauche du site Web wpcect.com est le mot Newsletter (bulletin d'information). M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu'il a cliqu\u00e9 sur ce mot, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 redirig\u00e9 sur un site Web appel\u00e9 le vinlandvoice.com. La premi\u00e8re page de ce site Web accueille le visiteur \u00e0 la page d'accueil du Vinland Voice, qui est d\u00e9crit comme un bulletin d'information qui vise \u00e0 [traduction] atteindre les Canadiens blancs et \u00e0 les informer des questions en litige dans leur collectivit\u00e9. Le texte continue en remerciant les partisans du Vinland Voice, puis se termine par l'expression RAHOWA. M. Warman a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que ce terme est utilis\u00e9 par les membres de groupes de supr\u00e9matie blanche pour se saluer entre eux. Il s'agit d'un acronyme pour l'expression Racial Holy War (guerre sainte raciale).\n[29] M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu'il a continu\u00e9 sa consultation du site Web vinlandvoice.com, il a trouv\u00e9 des bulletins d'information comportant plusieurs pages qui \u00e9taient apparemment publi\u00e9s hebdomadairement. La parution la plus ancienne du bulletin d'information Vinland Voice \u00e9tait dat\u00e9e du 30 ao\u00fbt 2001.\n[30] M. Warman a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsqu'il a d\u00e9couvert le site du Vinland Voice, il s'est inscrit en tant qu'abonn\u00e9 sous un pseudonyme, et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir par courrier \u00e9lectronique (courriel), hebdomadairement, les bulletins d'information. Il a adopt\u00e9 deux m\u00e9thodes pour compiler les documents qui, selon lui, contrevenaient \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi. Dans certains cas, il a coup\u00e9 le contenu des bulletins de l'endroit o\u00f9 ils se trouvaient sur le site Web vinlandvoice.com et il l'a coll\u00e9 dans un fichier de traitement de texte. Dans d'autres cas, il a simplement imprim\u00e9 les messages contenant les bulletins d'information qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s par courriel. Les exemplaires du bulletin d'information Vinland Voice qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s lors de l'audience \u00e9taient sous l'une ou l'autre de ces formes.\n[31] Je ne dispose d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve donnant \u00e0 penser que ces exemplaires \u00e9taient une repr\u00e9sentation inexacte des v\u00e9ritables bulletins d'information qui \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s sur Internet. Comme j'en traite plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, Terry Wilson, un enqu\u00eateur du service de police de London, en Ontario, a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir vu ces bulletins d'information sur Internet et les avoir re\u00e7us par courriel. Je suis convaincu que ces pi\u00e8ces sont une repr\u00e9sentation exacte des v\u00e9ritables bulletins d'information qui \u00e9taient affich\u00e9s sur le site Web vinlandvoice.com.\n[32] Chaque parution du Vinland Voice d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve contenait sur la premi\u00e8re page l'invitation suivante : [traduction] Allez consulter nos circulaires du CECT. Les bulletins d'information se terminaient tous avec lien au www.wpcect.com, c'est-\u00e0-dire au site Web du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. Dans certaines parutions, il y avait \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du lien le logo du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, soit la croix celtique combin\u00e9e avec la feuille d'\u00e9rable.\n[33] Les bulletins d'information \u00e9taient souvent un des articles d'autres sources, auxquels \u00e9taient ajout\u00e9s certains commentaires \u00e9ditoriaux. Par exemple, le bulletin d'information no 3, dat\u00e9 du 30 ao\u00fbt 2001, reproduisait ce qui semble \u00eatre un article d'un service de transmission se rapportant \u00e0 l'arrestation \u00e0 Toronto d'un individu qu'on croyait \u00eatre un membre d'un [traduction] groupe terroriste islamique ayant particip\u00e9 aux attentats \u00e0 la bombe d'ambassades am\u00e9ricaines. L'extrait \u00e9tait pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 du titre [traduction] Surprise, surprise, c'est pourquoi l'immigration DOIT cesser!\n[34] De plus, les bulletins d'information comportaient souvent des lettres et des commentaires exprimant du d\u00e9dain \u00e0 l'endroit des membres de l'Anti-Racist Action (ARA). M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il s'agit d'un groupe qui lutte contre le racisme, et qui a des sections locales partout en Am\u00e9rique du Nord, dont l'objet est de combattre les groupes n\u00e9onazis et les groupes racistes.\n[35] Les r\u00e9dacteurs du Vinland Voice ont \u00e9crit occasionnellement des articles se rapportant \u00e0 certaines de leurs exp\u00e9riences personnelles. Par exemple, il y a dans le bulletin d'information no 3 un article non sign\u00e9 qui d\u00e9crit ce qui s'est produit lors d'une f\u00eate d'anniversaire de [traduction] l'un des gars du TCS [Tri-City Skins], qui a semble-t-il eu lieu dans un bar \u00e0 Kitchener, en Ontario. Plusieurs paragraphes apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l'article, l'auteur \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\n[...] mon ami et moi \u00e9tions \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur avec quelques skinbyrds en train de parler et de fumer lorsqu'un n\u00e8gre imb\u00e9cile avec une face de singe est venu au bar avec un b\u00e2ton. C'est \u00e0 rire aux \u00e9clats : 1 n\u00e8gre et 1 b\u00e2ton contre 15 skins, c'est pour cela, et pour aucune autre raison que ce n\u00e8gre \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement stupide. Tout le reste des ordures des villes a choisi de rester de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rue. Juste comme nous \u00e9tions sur le point de nous approcher du n\u00e8gre pour lui montrer ce qu'il pouvait faire avec le b\u00e2ton, le propri\u00e9taire de ce respectable \u00e9tablissement s'en est m\u00eal\u00e9 et l'a d\u00e9sarm\u00e9, en nous avertissant que les policiers arrivaient par les escaliers. Il y en avait partout.\n[36] M. Warman a choisi de mettre en \u00e9vidence le bulletin d'information no 5 dans son t\u00e9moignage. Ce bulletin, dat\u00e9 du 14 septembre 2001, traitait longuement des attaques terroristes qui avaient eu lieu aux \u00c9.-U. trois jours plus t\u00f4t. Le titre de l'article d'ouverture \u00e9tait Editor's Voice. Le nom de l'auteur, \u00e0 la fin du texte, \u00e9tait WPCanada. Comme il en sera trait\u00e9 plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, M. Warman pr\u00e9tend que WPCanada signifie White Power Canada, et qu'il s'agit en fait d'un pseudonyme utilis\u00e9 par M. Richardson. L'article est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 comme suit :\n[traduction]\nHum! O\u00f9 commencer? J'en ai tellement \u00e0 dire et le bulletin d'information est d\u00e9j\u00e0 si volumineux. Alors, je vais essayer d'\u00eatre bref. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, vous verrez des opinions exprim\u00e9es par de nombreuses diff\u00e9rentes personnes et je ne dis pas d'un ton de d\u00e9fi que mon opinion est la bonne opinion, mais c'est la mienne et vous \u00eates maintenant pris pour la lire.\nS'il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu un temps pour se tenir debout et vous faire entendre, ce temps est maintenant. La guerre est ouverte et les gants sont jet\u00e9s. J'ai eu diff\u00e9rentes opinions depuis la trag\u00e9die survenue aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Mais, m\u00eame si ma col\u00e8re et mes opinions sont pass\u00e9es d'un extr\u00eame \u00e0 l'autre, je continue \u00e0 mettre l'accent sur une chose. De nombreux Blancs sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s tragiquement et, comme toujours, les Juifs y sont m\u00eal\u00e9s. Je n'aime pas que des Blancs innocents meurent pour rien et en particulier \u00e0 cause de ces sales Juifs.\nEt oui, je tiens \u00e9galement TOUS les musulmans personnellement responsables. M\u00eame le gouvernement am\u00e9ricain, pour avoir amen\u00e9 cette guerre sur le sol am\u00e9ricain en fournissant aux Juifs des armes pour d\u00e9truire les musulmans. C'est maintenant le temps de reprendre nos rues. Je d\u00e9clare mon propre acte de guerre. J'encourage tous les racistes et en particulier tous les membres du C.E.C.T. \u00e0 faire de m\u00eame. Il y a plusieurs cibles sur le sol canadien comme les bureaux de B'nai Brith, les temples du Mossad et quant \u00e0 moi tous les temples, \u00e9difices, maisons et m\u00eame les v\u00e9hicules juifs et arabes. Il n'y a pas de Juifs innocents en particulier en temps de guerre. Je vous demande de pleurer la perte de nombreux des n\u00f4tres qui ont p\u00e9ri \u00e0 New York et Washington et je veux que vous orientiez cette col\u00e8re et que vous l'utilisiez pour lutter contre nos ennemis.\nLe monde comme nous le connaissons a chang\u00e9; \u00e0 partir de maintenant tout ce que nous connaissons sera diff\u00e9rent. De nombreux autres Blancs mourront en combattant les musulmans et les Juifs. Peut-\u00eatre que ce sera la derni\u00e8re guerre? Je ne sais pas. Ce que je sais, c'est que nous ne devons jamais laisser cela nous arriver de nouveau. Nous devons faire appel \u00e0 nos gouvernements et arr\u00eater toute l'immigration en Am\u00e9rique du Nord. Nous devons expulser tous les Juifs, les musulmans, les Arabes et tous les autres groupes terroristes ou religieux connus. En leur permettant de vivre dans notre pays et de demander l'asile, nous leur permettons d'utiliser nos propres ressources (c'est-\u00e0-dire notre aide sociale ou nos dossiers publics, etc.) contre nous. Ce sont nos rues, c'est notre terre et le temps de combattre est MAINTENANT. C'est en fait notre RAHOWA! Unis nous vaincrons.\nWPCanada\nEn avant vers la victoire!\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[37] Plusieurs pages plus loin dans cette parution du bulletin d'information, un communiqu\u00e9 de presse de B'nai Brith Canada, dat\u00e9 du 11 septembre 2001, \u00e9tait reproduit. Le communiqu\u00e9 de presse condamnait les attaques du 11 septembre, de m\u00eame que les danses subs\u00e9quentes des Palestiniens qui avaient pr\u00e9tendument eu lieu dans les rues de Cisjordanie. Le commentaire \u00e9ditorial suivant a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 au-dessous de la reproduction du communiqu\u00e9 de presse :\n[traduction]\nVisiblement, les Juifs essaient de refiler la responsabilit\u00e9 et de diriger l'attention ailleurs. Bien, qu'ils aillent tous se faire foutre. Nous savons qui est responsable et ils VONT payer au nom de nos fr\u00e8res am\u00e9ricains. J'incite avec insistance tous les Canadiens qui sont le moindrement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s \u00e0 prendre des mesures contre B'nai Brith et toutes les autres organisations juives. Certains cocktails sont tr\u00e8s peu co\u00fbteux. MORT AU ZOG!\nM. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ZOG signifie Zionist Occupational Government. Quelques paragraphes plus loin le bulletin d'information \u00e9nonce ce qui suit : [traduction] AVERTISSEMENT DU DIRECTEUR DE LA SANT\u00c9 PUBLIQUE : Les Juifs sont dangereux pour les autres esp\u00e8ces.\n[38] Le bulletin d'information no 6, dat\u00e9 du 21 septembre 2001, poursuit sur le m\u00eame th\u00e8me des attaques du 11 septembre. Sur la premi\u00e8re page, il y a un article pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sous le titre Editor's Voice [traduction] (la voix de l'\u00e9diteur). L'auteur est apparemment WPCanada, dont le nom est imprim\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l'article. L'auteur \u00e9nonce la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle il aurait \u00e9crit le discours du pr\u00e9sident George W. Bush au congr\u00e8s am\u00e9ricain \u00e0 la suite des attaques :\n[traduction]\n[...] Aux responsables de la trag\u00e9die am\u00e9ricaine, je dis ce qui suit : Vous foutez-vous compl\u00e8tement de moi? Vos turbans enveloppent-ils de fa\u00e7on trop \u00e9troite vos t\u00eates? Avez-vous pass\u00e9 trop de temps sans vous laver? Ne savez-vous pas \u00e0 qui vous vous attaquez? [...]\nAvez-vous oubli\u00e9 l'histoire? Qu'est-il arriv\u00e9 aux derniers qui ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se foutre de nous? Rappelez-vous les petits salauds jaunes au Japon? Nous les avons gifl\u00e9s partout dans le Pacifique et nous en avons fait r\u00f4tir 2 millions sur leur propre terrain. C'est ce que nous en Am\u00e9rique nous appelons un barbecue de grande envergure. Avez-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu le Texas sur une carte? Vous \u00eates-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 pourquoi c'est si gros? C'est parce que nous le voulions ainsi. Les Mexicains ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 nous agacer avec l'Alamo et maintenant ils coupent nos gazons.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[39] La parution no 7 du Vinland Voice est dat\u00e9e du 28 septembre 2001. Le bulletin d'information commence par quatre courtes phrases, \u00e0 savoir :\n[traduction]\nLes Juifs sont responsables des politiques en mati\u00e8re d'immigration qui laissent les bombardiers arabes entrer au pays. Les Juifs sont responsables des politiques \u00e9trang\u00e8res qui font que les Arabes veulent nous attaquer. Les Juifs sont responsables de la dissimulation de ces faits dans leurs m\u00e9dias. En mettant fin au ZOG, on met fin au terrorisme.\nCe passage est suivi d'une phrase dans la m\u00eame forme que le serment d'all\u00e9geance am\u00e9ricain, \u00e0 savoir :\n[traduction]\nJe jure fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 au m\u00e9lange des races, des \u00c9tats-Juifs-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique, et au nouvel ordre mondial que ce pays repr\u00e9sente; un conglom\u00e9rat, sous le sionisme, avec la tyrannie et l'oppression pour tous.\n[40] Le bulletin d'information no 12, dat\u00e9 du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2001, contient un article de l'Editor's Voice qui critique les politiques d'Isra\u00ebl au Moyen-Orient. Mais, en traitant de la question, le r\u00e9dacteur en chef mentionne les Juifs en tant que des [traduction] conspirateurs de Rome et [traduction] tra\u00eetres envers le Christ. Il poursuit en \u00e9crivant qu'il appuie les attaques suicide contre les Isra\u00e9liens et avance l'id\u00e9e que [traduction] l'Angleterre aimerait peut-\u00eatre attribuer une portion de son propre territoire \u00e0 la peste sioniste. Il ajoute que lui, personnellement, [traduction] les mettrait dans des eaux chaudes, quelque part dans le Pacifique tropical.\n[41] Dans la m\u00eame parution du bulletin d'information, le r\u00e9dacteur \u00e9crit qu'il envoie un [traduction] gros bonjour \u00e0 M. Warman parce qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. Le r\u00e9dacteur s'identifie \u00e0 la fin des commentaires sous le nom de Totenkopf. Il renvoie apparemment \u00e0 une plainte initiale d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman aupr\u00e8s de la Commission en 2001, avant la pr\u00e9sente plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en f\u00e9vrier 2002. L'article dans le bulletin d'information contient l'adresse de la r\u00e9sidence de M. Warman. Le r\u00e9dacteur d\u00e9clare de plus ce qui suit : [traduction] nous remercions cet avocat juif et [traduction] nous donnons [\u00e0 M. Warman] 300 000 v\u00e9ritables raisons - et 5,7 millions de raisons invent\u00e9es - pour appuyer le [Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team]! Ce sera marrant! (It will be a gas!). Le message se termine par une derni\u00e8re note adress\u00e9e directement \u00e0 M. Warman :\n[traduction]\nRichard, nous t'avons ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 notre liste de cartes de No\u00ebl de cette ann\u00e9e. Qui sait, nous pourrions m\u00eame t'envoyer une indemnit\u00e9 de vacances pour l'indemnit\u00e9 que ta famille n'a pas re\u00e7ue pour son travail \u00e0 Auschwitz.\nC. Troisi\u00e8me question - La documentation est-elle susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite? [42] Il faut, pour traiter de cette question, examiner la signification des mots expose (exposer), hatred (haine) et contempt (m\u00e9pris). Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, de m\u00eame que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu la possibilit\u00e9 d'examiner le sens de ces termes dans des d\u00e9cisions. Le Tribunal, dans la d\u00e9cision Schnell, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 85 \u00e0 89, a fourni le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 suivant quant \u00e0 leurs conclusions :\nDans une premi\u00e8re affaire relative au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi, Taylor et le Western Guard Party c. la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, (1979), D.T. 1\/79, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a utilis\u00e9 le Oxford Dictionary comme source, d\u00e9finissant le mot hatred (haine) comme suit :\nactive dislike, detestation, enmity, ill will, malevolence (aversion active, d\u00e9testation, inimiti\u00e9, malice, malveillance).\net contempt (m\u00e9pris) comme :\nthe condition of being condemned or despised; dishonour or disgrace. (Le fait d'\u00eatre m\u00e9pris\u00e9 ou d\u00e9daign\u00e9; d\u00e9shonneur, disgr\u00e2ce).\nLe terme expose (exposer) est beaucoup plus passif que le terme incite (inciter) et d\u00e9montre que la personne qui transmet le message n'a pas l'intention de susciter une r\u00e9action violente chez la personne qui le re\u00e7oit. Plut\u00f4t, le terme exposer signifie laisser une personne sans protection; soumettre au ridicule, \u00e0 la censure ou au danger, cr\u00e9er des conditions propices \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, laissant le groupe identifiable expos\u00e9 \u00e0 la rancune ou \u00e0 l'hostilit\u00e9 ou le rendant susceptible d'\u00eatre ha\u00ef.\nLe Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dans l'affaire Nealy c. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, lorsqu'il a d\u00fb traiter une plainte en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi, a accept\u00e9 ces d\u00e9finitions et s'est pench\u00e9 sur le sens des termes haine et m\u00e9pris. Selon le Tribunal, la haine connote des sentiments comportant une malice extr\u00eame envers une autre personne ou un autre groupe de personnes. Quand on dit qu'on hait quelqu'un, c'est que l'on ne trouve aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te ses d\u00e9fauts. Le terme contempt (m\u00e9pris) sugg\u00e8re que l'on regarde quelqu'un de haut ou qu'on le traite comme s'il \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur. Cela refl\u00e8te la d\u00e9finition du dictionnaire de despise (d\u00e9daigner), dishonour (d\u00e9shonneur) ou disgrace (disgr\u00e2ce). Toutefois, la haine n'est pas directement li\u00e9e au m\u00e9pris. La haine dans certains cas peut \u00eatre le r\u00e9sultat de l'envie de qualit\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures comme l'intelligence, la richesse et le pouvoir, ce que le m\u00e9pris ne peut \u00eatre par d\u00e9finition.\nLe Tribunal dans l'affaire Nealy a aussi mentionn\u00e9 que l'utilisation du terme likely (susceptible) dans le paragraphe 13(1) signifie qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver que l'effet sera que les personnes qui entendent le message dirigeront leur haine ou leur m\u00e9pris contre d'autres. Il n'est pas non plus n\u00e9cessaire de prouver que, en fait, une personne a ainsi \u00e9t\u00e9 victime.\nL'affaire Taylor a fait l'objet d'un appel aupr\u00e8s de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892, la question principale \u00e9tant la constitutionnalit\u00e9 du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi relativement \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte. La Cour supr\u00eame, lorsqu'elle a conclu que le paragraphe 13(1) n'allait pas \u00e0 l'encontre de la Charte, a approuv\u00e9 les d\u00e9finitions des termes haine et m\u00e9pris utilis\u00e9s dans les affaires Taylor et Nealy. La Cour a conclu que le paragraphe 13(1) fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des \u00e9motions extr\u00eamement fortes et profondes de d\u00e9testation, de calomnie et de diffamation.\n(i) La documentation figurant sur le site tri-cityskins.com [43] J'estime que la documentation figurant sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com est susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes qui ne sont pas des chr\u00e9tiens ou qui ne sont pas de race blanche. Les personnes de race noire et les personnes de religion juive peuvent particuli\u00e8rement faire l'objet de ridicule, de malice ou d'hostilit\u00e9, cr\u00e9ant les conditions requises pour que s\u00e9visse contre eux la haine ou le m\u00e9pris.\n[44] Le pr\u00e9tendu humour qu'on retrouve dans les pages Jokes (blagues) et [...] Of the Month (du mois) expose sans l'ombre d'un doute ces groupes \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris. L'utilisation du terme [traduction] n\u00e8gre (nigger) dans ces [traduction] blagues, avec ses connotations quant \u00e0 l'esclavage, la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation et le racisme, d\u00e9montre en soi de la haine et du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes de race noire. Des remarques qui pr\u00e9sentent les Noirs comme des violeurs, des esclaves et de la nourriture pour des chiens m\u00e9chants d\u00e9notent des sentiments d'extr\u00eame malice contre eux. Ces blagues traitent manifestement les personnes de race noire avec d\u00e9dain et comme \u00eatres inf\u00e9rieurs. L'humour rabaisse la souffrance des Noirs et donne \u00e0 penser qu'ils n'ont aucune qualit\u00e9 rachetant leurs d\u00e9fauts.\n[45] Les devinettes qui traitent cruellement \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re du g\u00e9nocide des Juifs dans les camps de concentration nazis sont de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on humiliantes et empreintes de d\u00e9dain. D'autres groupes raciaux, religieux ou ethniques (les peuples autochtones, les latino-am\u00e9ricains, les habitants de l'Asie du Sud, les musulmans) ne sont pas non plus \u00e9pargn\u00e9s du d\u00e9nigrement. Ces d\u00e9clarations servent toutes \u00e0 d\u00e9shumaniser des personnes appartenant \u00e0 ces divers groupes.\n[46] Je dois mentionner que je n'ai extrait qu'une poign\u00e9e des blagues figurant sur le site Web. Les autres suivent toutes les m\u00eames th\u00e8mes et sont remplies de haine et de m\u00e9pris envers les groupes identifi\u00e9s.\n[47] L'extr\u00eame malice et l'extr\u00eame malveillance envers les personnes de race noire sont \u00e9galement r\u00e9pandues dans d'autres portions du site Web tri-cityskins.com. Dans ses articles, M. Pierce encourage les Sud-Africains \u00e0 [traduction] se d\u00e9barrasser de tous les Noirs et de tous ceux qui ne sont pas de race blanche et \u00e0 [traduction] les forcer \u00e0 partir, les st\u00e9riliser ou les tuer. Ses articles incitent ceux \u00e0 qui il s'adresse \u00e0 \u00eatre [traduction] pr\u00eats \u00e0 tuer et \u00e0 annihiler tous les comp\u00e9titeurs. De telles d\u00e9clarations (qui exhortent \u00e0 la mort, \u00e0 la st\u00e9rilisation ou \u00e0 l'expulsion de ceux qui ne sont pas de race blanche) d\u00e9notent une extr\u00eame malice et de la haine \u00e0 l'endroit des personnes qui ne sont pas de race blanche et donnent \u00e0 penser que les victimes de cette violence n'ont aucune qualit\u00e9 rachetant leurs d\u00e9fauts, ce qui par cons\u00e9quent les d\u00e9shumanise.\n[48] Les tentatives de M. Pierce visant \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter les Juifs comme des ennemis de l'\u00c9tat, [traduction] qui travaillent dans les coulisses et qui contr\u00f4lent les m\u00e9dias, servent \u00e0 nourrir et encourager \u00e0 leur endroit l'envie, la m\u00e9fiance ou le ressentiment, ce qui en retour engendre la haine contre eux. Ces messages haineux sont combin\u00e9s \u00e0 des signes de m\u00e9pris : [traduction] [Dershowitz] n'est m\u00eame pas un \u00eatre humain. [Il] est un Juif et cela dit tout. M. Pierce renforce son m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'endroit des Juifs et exhorte de plus \u00e0 la haine contre eux, en affirmant que Dershowitz et [traduction] sa tribu pr\u00e9conisent que la torture soit r\u00e9pandue pour tous les non-Juifs qui r\u00e9sistent \u00e0 la supr\u00e9matie juive.\n[49] Le site Web fait en sorte d'encourager le visiteur \u00e0 ressentir du m\u00e9pris envers ces groupes m\u00eame au moyen de ses liens vers d'autres sites Web. Il invite les visiteurs \u00e0 se rendre, en cliquant une seule fois sur la souris, sur le site du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (l'\u00e9quipe canadienne de purification ethnique). En prenant en compte les opinions exprim\u00e9es dans les articles de M. Pierce, il est assez facile de faire le lien entre le nom de ce groupe et un appel \u00e0 l'exclusion vigoureuse de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des personnes qui ne sont pas de race blanche. Un autre des sites Web li\u00e9s est le site whitesonly.net, qui a un logo qui revient sans honte sur le lynchage des personnes de race noire.\n[50] Je conclus, par cons\u00e9quent, que le site Web tri-cityskins.com contient des messages qui sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, du fait de leur race, de leur couleur, de leur religion ou de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, des personnes qui ne sont pas des chr\u00e9tiens (\u00e0 savoir des personnes de religion juive ou musulmane) ou qui ne sont pas des personnes de race blanche.\n(ii) La documentation figurant sur le site wpcect.com [51] J'ai tir\u00e9 la m\u00eame conclusion \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des messages figurant sur le site Web du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, le site wpcect.com, notamment dans les bulletins d'information Vinland Voice.\n[52] M. Kulbashian pr\u00e9tend que le contenu du Vinland Voice ne devrait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme faisant partie du site du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il se trouvait sur un site Web s\u00e9par\u00e9, le site vinlandvoice.com. Je ne partage pas cette opinion. Il importe peu que le contenu se trouve sur un site Web dont le site ne comporte pas l'abr\u00e9viation CECT. Il reste que lorsqu'ils cliquent sur l'ic\u00f4ne newsletter sur les pages Web du site wpcect.com, les visiteurs arrivent directement sur la page du Vinland Voice. Une fois sur cette page, on leur dit simplement qu'ils sont sur un site qui est exploit\u00e9 par le groupe CECT. Le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de nombreux bulletins d'information invite les visiteurs \u00e0 ce qui suit : [traduction] Allez consulter nos circulaires du CECT, et [traduction] Visitez le magasin du CECT. Sur la derni\u00e8re page de chaque parution, le lien au site wpcect.com est affich\u00e9 bien en vue. Je suis convaincu que la documentation figurant sur le site vinlandvoice.com fait partie int\u00e9grante de la documentation Internet du site wpcect.com.\n[53] L'article intitul\u00e9 Intro to Racial Woes sur la page Thoughts du site wpcect.com est truff\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarations d'extr\u00eame malice envers divers groupes ethniques, raciaux et religieux. On y accuse les Noirs et les Asiatiques de [traduction] polluer nos villes avec des gangs et de la drogue et de [traduction] coucher avec nos femmes. On y traite les ressortissants des Indes orientales de [traduction] d\u00e9go\u00fbtants et d'ind\u00e9sirables. On y repr\u00e9sente une fois de plus les Juifs comme des ennemis de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui [traduction] contr\u00f4lent tout ce qu'on voit et entend et qui m\u00e8nent une guerre contre [traduction] nous, c'est-\u00e0-dire la [traduction] race blanche. Ainsi, l'article a pour effet d'inspirer une crainte et un ressentiment extr\u00eame envers ces groupes, ce qui est susceptible de les exposer \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris.\n[54] Les m\u00eames th\u00e8mes font leur chemin dans les bulletins d'information. Le r\u00e9cit fait dans la parution no 3, par un individu non nomm\u00e9, de ses exploits se rapportant \u00e0 un Noir qui l'a affront\u00e9 dans un bar, est rempli d'\u00e9pith\u00e8tes comme [traduction] n\u00e8gre imb\u00e9cile avec une face de singe, stupide, et ordure, qui montrent un m\u00e9pris extr\u00eame envers les personnes de race noire.\n[55] Cependant, l'\u00e9ditorial de l'Editor's Voice du 14 septembre 2001 ne limitait pas sa cible \u00e0 ses attaques haineuses contre les personnes de race noire. \u00c0 peu pr\u00e8s tous les groupes dont les individus ne sont pas de race blanche et ne sont pas chr\u00e9tiens devenaient des victimes. Les [traduction] sales Juifs et les musulmans sont responsables de la mort, le 11 septembre 2001, de milliers d'[traduction] individus blancs, qui inspirera vraisemblablement de la haine contre ces groupes. L'article fait ensuite appel de fa\u00e7on irresponsable aux [traduction] racistes et aux membres du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des actes violents contre non seulement les \u00e9difices et les institutions des collectivit\u00e9s juives et arabes au Canada, mais aussi contre des individus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'y a [traduction] pas de Juifs innocents. Ces commentaires exposent de fa\u00e7on incontestable les membres de ces groupes \u00e0 de la haine, du m\u00e9pris et \u00e0 un r\u00e9el danger physique en donnant \u00e0 penser que toutes les manifestations des collectivit\u00e9s juives et arabes sont des cibles l\u00e9gitimes de violence punitive aveugle. Les commentaires transmettent \u00e9galement un message selon lequel ces groupes n'ont aucune qualit\u00e9 rachetant leurs d\u00e9fauts. L'auteur expose de plus les Juifs, les musulmans et les Arabes \u00e0 du m\u00e9pris en \u00e9tablissant une correspondance entre eux et les terroristes responsables des attaques du 11 septembre. Son appel \u00e0 l'expulsion de ces groupes laisse entendre qu'ils n'ont aucune qualit\u00e9 rachetant leurs d\u00e9fauts et qu'ils sont inaptes \u00e0 vivre dans [traduction] notre pays.\n[56] L'incitation \u00e0 la violence n'\u00e9tait pas limit\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9ditorial de l'Editor's Voice. Plus loin dans la m\u00eame parution, il y a un commentaire \u00e9ditorial qui encourage de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente des attaques au Cocktail Molotov contre des organisations juives. La collectivit\u00e9 juive au Canada est une fois de plus expos\u00e9e \u00e0 un danger en raison de ces commentaires haineux, qui sont plus loin dans le m\u00eame bulletin d'information renforc\u00e9s par la remarque narquoise selon laquelle [traduction] les Juifs sont dangereux pour les autres esp\u00e8ces, une d\u00e9claration d\u00e9shumanisante et m\u00e9prisante qui inspire de la haine contre eux.\n[57] On a choisi, dans la parution du 21 septembre 2001, de se moquer de la coiffure religieuse des musulmans, de banaliser la mort de millions de Japonais au cours de la Seconde Guerre mondiale et d'exacerber cette insulte en y ajoutant une \u00e9pith\u00e8te raciste malveillante ([traduction] salauds jaunes). Ces remarques irrespectueuses servent \u00e0 d\u00e9shumaniser ces groupes et les exposent ainsi au m\u00e9pris.\n[58] La parution suivante du bulletin d'information (du 28 septembre 2001) poursuivait sur le th\u00e8me consistant \u00e0 rejeter la responsabilit\u00e9 des actes terroristes r\u00e9cents sur le contr\u00f4le que les Juifs exercent pr\u00e9tendument sur les \u00c9tats-Unis, que le bulletin d\u00e9crivait comme les Jew-nited States of America (les \u00c9tats-Juifs-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique). Ces commentaires servent une fois de plus \u00e0 exposer des Juifs \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris en tentant de diriger vers eux l'horreur et la crainte ressenties par de nombreuses personnes \u00e0 la suite du 11 septembre.\n[59] M. Kulbashian a pr\u00e9tendu que ces remarques et d'autres remarques similaires faites dans le Vinland Voice constituaient un discours politique et n'\u00e9taient pas destin\u00e9es \u00e0 exposer des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. L'intention d'exercer de la discrimination, cependant, n'est pas une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 une conclusion de discrimination (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, aux pages 549 et 550; Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892, aux pages 931 \u00e0 934). En outre, le langage utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 13 est clair; ce sont les effets de la propagande qui ont retenu l'attention du l\u00e9gislateur. La question \u00e0 poser n'est pas celle de savoir si celui qui transmet le message a l'intention de communiquer de la haine ou du m\u00e9pris, mais celle de savoir si le message lui-m\u00eame est susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable. Si effectivement le contenu du bulletin d'information \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 exprimer une pr\u00e9tendue opinion politique, le message aurait pu \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 sans recourir au langage extr\u00e9miste et d\u00e9nigrant qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9pandu dans les diverses publications du bulletin d'information qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve (voir Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canadian Liberty Net, [1992] 3 C.F. 155, au paragraphe 57 (C.F. 1re inst.)).\n[60] On peut dire la m\u00eame chose de la critique faite par le r\u00e9dacteur en chef du Vinland Voice \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des politiques d'Isra\u00ebl expos\u00e9e dans le bulletin d'information no 12. Le r\u00e9dacteur a recours \u00e0 un langage d\u00e9nigrant contre les Juifs, les d\u00e9crivant de [traduction] peste sioniste. Cette description, tout comme la description selon laquelle ils sont des [traduction] tra\u00eetres envers le Christ, pourrait vraisemblablement inciter des chr\u00e9tiens et d'autres personnes \u00e0 ressentir de la haine et du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'endroit des Juifs. Cette inf\u00e9rence peut facilement \u00eatre tir\u00e9e lorsqu'on examine le contexte de cet article. Cet article avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, dans le m\u00eame bulletin d'information, d'une attaque contre M. Warman dans laquelle les victimes de l'Holocauste \u00e9taient cruellement ridiculis\u00e9es :\n[traduction]\n- Une indemnit\u00e9 de vacances... pour son travail \u00e0 Auschwitz;\n- Ce sera marrant (It will be a gas) - ce que j'interpr\u00e8te comme une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux chambres \u00e0 gaz utilis\u00e9es dans les camps de la mort nazis;\n- 300 000 v\u00e9ritables raisons et 5,7 millions de raisons invent\u00e9es - ce qui sert \u00e0 laisser entendre que l'Holocauste n'a pas eu lieu ou que le bilan des d\u00e9c\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 nettement exag\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\u00c0 mon avis, ces remarques ont pour effet d'exposer des Juifs \u00e0 des sentiments de d\u00e9dain et de m\u00e9pris.\n[61] Pour tous les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, je conclus que les messages figurant sur le site Web du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, sur le site wpcect.com et sur le site vinlandvoice.com, sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris, du fait de leur couleur, de leur religion ou de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, des personnes qui ne sont pas des chr\u00e9tiens et qui ne sont pas de race blanche. \u00c0 partir de maintenant, dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j'utiliserai l'expression messages de haine pour parler de la documentation de m\u00eame que des messages figurant sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com dont j'ai trait\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n[62] Selon le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi, la communication de propagande haineuse doit \u00eatre faite de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e pour qu'il s'agisse d'un acte discriminatoire. Je souligne que dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, M. Warman et M. Wilson n'ont eu aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 naviguer sur les sites Web en question, et \u00e0 recevoir r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement sur leur ordinateur des tranches successives de messages de haine au cours d'une p\u00e9riode de plusieurs mois. \u00c0 mon avis, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que toute personne qui utilisait Internet pouvait prendre connaissance de la propagande haineuse \u00e0 tout moment, cette propagande \u00e9tait effectivement faite de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e.\n(iii) Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Frances Henry [63] Lors de l'audience, la Commission a fait t\u00e9moigner Mme Frances Henry en tant qu'experte des questions de racisme et de propagande haineuse. \u00c0 mon avis, son rapport et son t\u00e9moignage consistaient essentiellement en son opinion sur la question ultime qui \u00e9tait soumise au Tribunal. Elle n'a fourni au Tribunal aucun point de vue significatif quant aux aspects st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9s ou raciaux des messages de haine et quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle ces aspects pourraient exposer des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, du moins certainement pas plus que ce que le Tribunal peut \u00e9valuer lui-m\u00eame ou peut recueillir dans l'ensemble de la jurisprudence se rapportant \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi. De plus, au cours de son contre-interrogatoire, elle a reconnu que ses \u00e9tudes portaient sur le racisme et sur la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle il se manifestait, et non particuli\u00e8rement sur le domaine de la propagande haineuse en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[64] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Henry n'a par cons\u00e9quent pas de port\u00e9e sur ma d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nD. Quatri\u00e8me question - M. Kulbashian ou M. Richardson, agissant seul ou agissant d'un commun accord l'un avec l'autre ou avec d'autres personnes, ont-ils de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e communiqu\u00e9 ou fait communiquer les messages de haine? (i) La preuve recueillie par M. Warman [65] M. Warman et la Commission pr\u00e9tendent que M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson ont communiqu\u00e9 de diverses fa\u00e7ons les messages de haine sur Internet. Cette pr\u00e9tention s'appuie sur la preuve recueillie par M. Warman, de m\u00eame que sur celle recueillie par le service de police de London. M. Warman pr\u00e9tend que M. Kulbashian, pour \u00e9viter d'\u00eatre identifi\u00e9, a utilis\u00e9 les pseudonymes Alex Krause et Totenkopf dans ses activit\u00e9s, et que M. Richardson utilisait les noms James Scott et WPCanada (une abr\u00e9viation pour White Power Canada).\n[66] Au cours de la surveillance des sites Web sur lesquels figurait les messages de haine, M. Warman a essay\u00e9 de conna\u00eetre l'identit\u00e9 de la personne ou des personnes qui exploitaient ces sites. Les sites Web \u00e9taient identifi\u00e9s par le nom de domaine (c'est-\u00e0-dire tri-cityskins.com, wpcect.com, vinlandvoice.com). Les noms de domaine doivent \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s d'un service d'enregistrement de nom de domaine. Selon M. Warman, l'un des plus importants de ces services est exploit\u00e9 par une entreprise connue sous le nom de register.com. Cette entreprise offre \u00e9galement un service en ligne, nomm\u00e9 une recherche Who-is, qui permet \u00e0 une personne de soumettre un nom de domaine d'un site Web et d'obtenir les noms de ses personnes-ressources. M. Warman a fait une telle recherche en octobre 2001, et a obtenu les r\u00e9sultats suivants :\nTri-cityskins.com :\nLe dossier se rapportant \u00e0 son nom de domaine a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 le 6 mars 2001. Le titulaire de cet enregistrement \u00e9tait inscrit comme Tri-City Skinheads, et l'adresse d\u00e9clar\u00e9e \u00e9tait le 14 Eighty-Eighth Avenue, Kitchener (Ontario) 5M4RTIES. Le nom donn\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de personne-ressource pour les questions techniques du site Web \u00e9tait Skinheads, Tri-City. M. Warman croit que ces renseignements sont clairement fictifs. Le nom de la rue est une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au num\u00e9ro 88, qui, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, signifie pr\u00e9tendument Heil Hitler. Le code postal imite le mot smarties. Le nom fourni \u00e0 titre de personne-ressource pour les questions d'administration du site Web est Public\/Press Relations - CECT, Totenkopf. M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le mot Totenkopf signifie [traduction] t\u00eate de mort en allemand, et est symbolis\u00e9 par une t\u00eate de mort. C'\u00e9tait le logo utilis\u00e9 par les divisions blind\u00e9es Panzers des Nazis SS durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale. L'adresse de la personne-ressource pour les questions d'administration est P.O. Box 1061, 31 Adelaide Street East, Toronto, Ontario. Le serveur du domaine mentionn\u00e9 est Affordable-Space.com.\nWpcect.com :\nLe dossier se rapportant \u00e0 ce nom de domaine de site Web a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2001, et venait juste d'\u00eatre mis \u00e0 jour le 3 octobre 2001 lorsque M. Warman a fait sa recherche Who-is. Le titulaire de l'enregistrement qui appara\u00eet est C.E.C.T., et son adresse inscrite est P.O. Box 1061, 31 Adelaide Street East, Toronto, qui est une adresse identique \u00e0 celle pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9e comme adresse de la personne-ressource pour les questions d'administration pour le site tri-cityskins.com, \u00e0 savoir Totenkopf. La personne-ressource qui est inscrite pour les questions d'administration, pour les questions techniques et pour la facturation pour le site Wpcect.com est la m\u00eame personne, \u00e0 savoir WPCANADA, Totenkopf, avec comme adresse la m\u00eame case postale pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9e. Le serveur du domaine du site Web qui est mentionn\u00e9 est \u00e9galement Affordable-Space.com.\n[67] M. Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve une copie papier d'une page du site Web wpcect.com, sur laquelle on d\u00e9clare que le [traduction] C.E.C.T. a enfin une case postale. Cette d\u00e9claration est sign\u00e9e Totenkopf, et l'adresse de la case postale est identique \u00e0 celle trouv\u00e9e lors des recherches Who-is pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9es. Dans la section [traduction] Personnes-ressources du site Web wpcect.com, il y a un tableau indiquant qu'on doit envoyer un message par courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 Totenkopf@wpcect.com pour [traduction] les relations publiques et les relations avec la presse, pour des renseignements sur l'organisation ou pour soumettre des conseils qui pourraient nous aider dans notre mission. Les courriels se rapportant [traduction] aux affaires internes et pour devenir membre si vous n'\u00eates pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 membre d'une organisation militant pour la race blanche devraient \u00eatre envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 WPCanada@wpcect.com. Les renseignements se rapportant \u00e0 la case postale du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team apparaissent \u00e9galement de nouveau sur cette page.\n[68] M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9galement fait une recherche Who-is \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du site Web Affordable Space.com. L'adresse de la personne-ressource pour les questions d'administration \u00e9tait la m\u00eame que celle pour les sites tri-cityskins.com et wpcect.com, \u00e0 savoir P.O. Box 1061, 31 Adelaide Street East, Toronto.\n[69] La recherche faite par M. Warman l'a de plus amen\u00e9 \u00e0 un site Web d'un festival de film \u00e9tudiant qui avait eu lieu en mai 2001. Sur leur site Web, les organisateurs du festival [traduction] remerciaient sp\u00e9cialement le [traduction] serveur d'h\u00e9bergement du site, Alexan Kulbashian. M. Warman a alors fait une recherche Who-is \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du site Web du festival, qui a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le serveur du domaine du site \u00e9tait affordable-space.com.\n[70] M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 sa connaissance, les serveurs de domaines sont utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 un niveau interm\u00e9diaire. Ils donnent la possibilit\u00e9 aux sites Web des titulaires de noms de domaines d'\u00eatre accessibles au public sur Internet. M. Warman ne semblait pas \u00eatre totalement s\u00fbr de cette explication et, sauf quant \u00e0 sa connaissance de base d'Internet en tant qu'utilisateur fr\u00e9quent, il ne pr\u00e9tendait pas \u00eatre un expert dans ce domaine et il n'a pas non plus fait un t\u00e9moignage en ce sens. Cependant, les intim\u00e9s n'ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve pour contredire M. Warman. De plus, il ressort de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente des documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par M. Warman qu'un serveur de domaine a un r\u00f4le important \u00e0 jouer dans l'exploitation d'un site Web, \u00e0 un point tel que l'identification du serveur de domaine justifie qu'il soit mentionn\u00e9 sur le registre Who-is. Il importe de mentionner que dans le cas de tri-cityskins.com et dans celui de wpcect.com, Affordable Space.com \u00e9tait leur serveur de domaine.\n[71] La recherche de M. Warman l'a \u00e9galement amen\u00e9 \u00e0 entrer le nom Alexan Kulbashian sur le moteur de recherche Google d'Internet, qui a balay\u00e9 Internet pour trouver tous les sites contenant ces mots cl\u00e9s. Les r\u00e9sultats de la recherche incluaient un site sur lequel \u00e9tait affich\u00e9 un curriculum vit\u00e6 d'une personne nomm\u00e9e Alexan Kulbashian. Les d\u00e9tails apparaissant dans ce curriculum vit\u00e6 sont compatibles avec les autres d\u00e9tails personnels se rapportant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, M. Kulbashian, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve. Je suis convaincu qu'il s'agit de son curriculum vit\u00e6.\n[72] La recherche de M. Warman a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en d\u00e9cembre 2002, mais le curriculum vit\u00e6 lui-m\u00eame ne porte aucune date. Le curriculum vit\u00e6 expose, sous le titre [traduction] Exp\u00e9rience, la participation de M. Kulbashian, \u00e0 partir de 1999, \u00e0 Affordable Space.com, qui est d\u00e9crit comme une entreprise qui h\u00e9berge, cr\u00e9e et fournit du soutien technique \u00e0 des sites Web. Le curriculum vit\u00e6 \u00e9nonce qu'Affordable Space.com a d\u00e9but\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de projet priv\u00e9 qui s'est ensuite transform\u00e9 en une entreprise qui h\u00e9berge plus de mille comptes et l'auteur ajoute ce qui suit : [traduction] en ce moment je travaille \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration d'un service de soutien technique 24 heures par jour et 7 jours par semaine pour l'entreprise.\n[73] En se fondant sur tous les renseignements qu'il a recueillis et assembl\u00e9s, M. Warman croit que M. Kulbashian participait \u00e0 la fourniture de services d'h\u00e9bergement de sites Web, au moyen d'une entreprise connue sous le nom d'Affordable Space.com, et que wpcect.com de m\u00eame que tri-cityskins.com faisaient partie des sites Web h\u00e9berg\u00e9s par M. Kulbashian. M. Warman pr\u00e9tend que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont suffisants pour \u00e9tablir un lien entre M. Kulbashian et les messages de haine.\n(ii) La preuve recueillie par le service de police de London [74] La Commission s'appuie sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve recueillis au cours d'une enqu\u00eate criminelle pour \u00e9tablir un autre lien entre M. Kulbashian et les messages de haine. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, selon ce qui est all\u00e9gu\u00e9, \u00e9tablissent de plus le lien avec M. Richardson. La Commission a appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin Terry Wilson, qui travaillait en tant qu'enqu\u00eateur pour le service de police de London (Ontario), durant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle M. Warman avait pris connaissance des messages de haine sur Internet. M. Wilson travaillait au sein de l'unit\u00e9 des crimes motiv\u00e9s par la haine et ses enqu\u00eates incluaient la surveillance des sites Web et des services d'\u00e9changes en ligne (aussi connus comme la messagerie instantan\u00e9e), o\u00f9 les gens communiquent directement en ligne les uns avec les autres au moyen d'Internet. Il \u00e9tait au courant que certains des sites Web qu'il surveillait appartenaient \u00e0 des organisations situ\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9gion de London-Kitchener-Waterloo.\n[75] M. Wilson a adopt\u00e9 un pseudonyme et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 participer \u00e0 certains des dialogues en ligne qu'il surveillait. Un des participants au service de dialogue en ligne exploit\u00e9 par le site Web tri-cityskins.com utilisait le nom de coxswain24wpcanada. M. Wilson a engag\u00e9 des \u00e9changes par courriel avec cet individu, qui l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il se trouvait \u00e0 London, en Ontario, et qu'il faisait partie d'une organisation, le Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, qui avait plusieurs membres \u00e0 London. M. Wilson a \u00e9crit que lui aussi voulait devenir membre. Le 22 ao\u00fbt 2001, M. Wilson a re\u00e7u par courriel une r\u00e9ponse l'informant qu'il y aurait une r\u00e9union le m\u00eame soir. L'exp\u00e9diteur du courriel lui a donn\u00e9 son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 London et a sign\u00e9 le message du nom de James.\n[76] En v\u00e9rifiant o\u00f9 se trouvait l'endroit associ\u00e9 au num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, M. Wilson a remarqu\u00e9 que l'adresse correspondait \u00e0 celle d'un ensemble d'habitations o\u00f9 un g\u00e9rant de l'\u00e9difice avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la police en all\u00e9guant que quelqu'un avait maquill\u00e9 les corridors et les ascenseurs de l'\u00e9difice avec des autocollants portant des messages racistes. M. Wilson a rencontr\u00e9 le g\u00e9rant de l'\u00e9difice qui a fourni le bail des lieux o\u00f9 le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9. Le bail mentionnait deux colocataires : James S. Richardson et une femme, dont l'identit\u00e9 n'a pas besoin d'\u00eatre r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Le g\u00e9rant de l'\u00e9difice a dit qu'ils r\u00e9sidaient \u00e0 cet endroit depuis novembre 2000.\n[77] Un peu apr\u00e8s avoir commenc\u00e9 ses \u00e9changes par courriel avec l'individu nomm\u00e9 James, l'adresse de courriel de M. Wilson a d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la liste d'envoi du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, qui a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui envoyer les bulletins d'information Vinland Voice par courriel. Lorsque M. Wilson a pris connaissance de la parution du 14 septembre 2001 de ce bulletin d'information (qui comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli contient une partie des messages de haine en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire), il a entrepris une enqu\u00eate criminelle distincte quant \u00e0 ce qu'il percevait \u00eatre des menaces de mort qui y \u00e9taient contenues.\n[78] M. Wilson a obtenu un mandat de perquisition pour l'appartement en question et il a ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 ce mandat le 28 septembre 2001. M. Richardson \u00e9tait dans l'appartement lorsque les policiers sont entr\u00e9s et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d'avoir prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des menaces contre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les personnes et d'avoir conseill\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 des actes criminels de meurtre ou de dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[79] M. Wilson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir trouv\u00e9 sur les lieux un grand drapeau avec l'embl\u00e8me du svastika nazi. Il y avait \u00e9galement un blouson de style aviateur avec pi\u00e8ce rapport\u00e9e \u00e9tiquet\u00e9e Tri-City Skins sur un c\u00f4t\u00e9. Sur l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du blouson, il y avait une pi\u00e8ce rapport\u00e9e avec le logo consistant en une moiti\u00e9 de croix celtique et une moiti\u00e9 de feuille d'\u00e9rable, qui \u00e9tait associ\u00e9 au groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, comme cela \u00e9tait montr\u00e9 sur le site wpcect.com. M. Wilson a \u00e9galement trouv\u00e9 des feuilles perfor\u00e9es qui sont utilis\u00e9es pour imprimer des cartes professionnelles \u00e0 l'aide d'une imprimante d'ordinateur. Les cartes avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 imprim\u00e9es. Au centre de chaque carte il y avait inscrit : Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team! In partnership with the National Skinhead Front. Dans le coin inf\u00e9rieur, le nom WPCanada apparaissait, suivi des mots Recruiting Director. Les cartes n'avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tach\u00e9es le long de leurs perforations, donnant \u00e0 penser que peut-\u00eatre elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 imprim\u00e9es sur les lieux.\n[80] Un policier, analyste en mati\u00e8re criminelle, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en preuve \u00e9lectronique a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la fouille. Il a saisi un ordinateur trouv\u00e9 dans l'appartement, et une fois de retour au poste de police, il a fait une copie exacte du disque dur de l'ordinateur et en a examin\u00e9 le contenu. Parmi les r\u00e9pertoires trouv\u00e9s sur le disque dur, il y avait un r\u00e9pertoire qui contenait les journaux des sessions d'\u00e9changes en ligne auxquelles avait particip\u00e9 l'utilisateur de l'ordinateur. Ces journaux \u00e9taient organis\u00e9s en dossiers qui portaient le nom du participant qui avait entam\u00e9 une session particuli\u00e8re de dialogue en ligne. Les journaux sont faits d'une mani\u00e8re similaire \u00e0 celle d'un sc\u00e9nario d'une pi\u00e8ce. Lorsque les participants dialoguent en ligne, leur nom appara\u00eet en premier suivi de la d\u00e9claration qu'ils ont \u00e9crite. Toutes les personnes qui prennent part \u00e0 la discussion en ligne peuvent voir les commentaires de chaque participant.\n[81] L'un des journaux contenus sur l'ordinateur saisi \u00e9tait au nom de #wpcanada. Parmi les participants \u00e0 la discussion dans ce journal, il y a un individu qui utilise le nom WPCanada. Au cours d'une session qui a eu lieu \u00e0 2 h, le 4 septembre 2001, WPCanada dit qu'il met fin \u00e0 la communication et qu'il va se coucher. Une des autres participantes, nomm\u00e9e DeadGrl, r\u00e9pond qu'elle [traduction] fait un signe de la main \u00e0 James et dit bye bye. Dans une autre session, le nom de Sheila Copps, qui est une ancienne d\u00e9put\u00e9e d'Hamilton, est mentionn\u00e9. WPCanada ajoute ensuite qu'[traduction] elle est de ma ville. M. Wilson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir vu le permis de conduire de M. Richardson au moment de l'arrestation. L'adresse apparaissant sur le permis est \u00e0 Hamilton. Les documents se rapportant \u00e0 la mise en libert\u00e9 de M. Richardson apr\u00e8s l'arrestation montrent qu'il \u00e9tait tenu de r\u00e9sider \u00e0 la m\u00eame adresse \u00e0 Hamilton que celle indiqu\u00e9e sur son permis de conduire.\n[82] Au cours d'une autre session de dialogue en ligne, le journal montre que WPCanada \u00e9crit le mot away, qui est utilis\u00e9 lors des discussions en ligne pour indiquer qu'une personne s'est absent\u00e9e de la session. Environ une heure plus tard, un individu utilisant le nom Totenkopf joint la session et \u00e9crit : [traduction] James, r\u00e9veille-toi. Personne ne r\u00e9pond, alors Totenkopf \u00e9crit ensuite : [traduction] D'accord... alors va dormir. Au cours d'un autre \u00e9change, un participant appel\u00e9 TankTCS informe WPCanada qu'il a [traduction] une chemise nazie pour toi James. WPCanada r\u00e9pond OK. La m\u00eame conversation continue plus tard. TankTCS demande : [traduction] James, lesquelles [chemises] veux-tu?. WPCanada r\u00e9pond : [traduction] Je les veux noires.\n[83] Le 13 septembre 2001, TankTCS entre dans la session en \u00e9crivant : [traduction] James... comment vas-tu? WPCanada r\u00e9pond en \u00e9crivant qu'il se dispute avec sa femme et mentionne le m\u00eame pr\u00e9nom que celui de la femme dont le pr\u00e9nom est mentionn\u00e9 comme colocataire de l'appartement de London o\u00f9 M. Richardson a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9. WPCanada \u00e9crit ensuite qu'il est [traduction] juste en train de finir le Voice, et il ajoute que c'est un gros (biggie). La Commission souligne que l'article du Vinland Voice qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arrestation de M. Richardson \u00e9tait sur Internet le lendemain, le 14 septembre 2001. Cet article de l'Editor's Voice \u00e9tait sign\u00e9 WPCanada.\n[84] Il y a plusieurs autres messages affich\u00e9s sur les journaux des dialogues en ligne o\u00f9 des participants mentionnent le nom de James lorsqu'ils renvoient \u00e0 WPCanada.\n[85] Dans une autre session, WPCanada discute avec un individu qui utilise le nom de Bones2001, du bulletin d'information du site wpcect.com. WPCanada lui dit qu'il devrait [traduction] \u00e9crire un article pour nous, et sugg\u00e8re que s'il veut recevoir le bulletin d'information par courriel, il devrait envoyer un message \u00e0 cect@wpcect.com, et il lui dit : [traduction] je vais te mettre en contact.\n[86] Un des autres journaux de dialogues en ligne porte le nom Ihatejews (je hais les juifs). La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un extrait d'une session qui a eu lieu vers 1 h 30, le 14 septembre 2001. Un participant \u00e0 cette session explique qu'il vient juste de lire le bulletin d'information du CECT que [traduction] tu as publi\u00e9 quelques jours avant et qu'il l'a vraiment aim\u00e9. WPCanada r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ce commentaire en disant : [traduction] Attends de voir demain [...] une d\u00e9claration de guerre par le CECT contre B'nai Brith, les Juifs, les musulmans. M. Warman souligne que cela refl\u00e8te le contenu actuel de l'article du Vinland Voice qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 le 14 septembre 2001. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que ce dialogue en ligne a effectivement eu lieu la nuit avant la publication du bulletin d'information, M. Warman croit que le fait que WPCanada connaissait d'avance son contenu d\u00e9montre qu'il a d\u00fb en \u00eatre l'auteur.\n[87] Chose int\u00e9ressante, parmi les divers dossiers trouv\u00e9s dans l'ordinateur saisi dans l'appartement de London, il y avait un fichier de traitement de texte intitul\u00e9 vv5. Une copie du fichier a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite lors de l'audience. Il s'agissait du texte complet de la parution du 14 septembre 2001 du Vinland Voice (bulletin d'information no 5) que M. Warman et M. Wilson avaient re\u00e7u par courriel et avait vu sur le site Web du Vinland Voice. Les dossiers de l'ordinateur d\u00e9montraient que ce fichier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re fois le 14 septembre 2001, \u00e0 3 h 45. Ce fait appuie l'inf\u00e9rence selon laquelle M. Richardson avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en possession de cette parution du bulletin d'information avant sa distribution, et qu'il avait particip\u00e9 directement \u00e0 sa communication subs\u00e9quente sur Internet.\n[88] Les divers journaux des dialogues en ligne comprennent de nombreux messages affich\u00e9s par WPCanada qui montrent clairement sa participation active \u00e0 la production du bulletin d'information Vinland Voice :\n[traduction]\n- Nous avons un bulletin d'information hebdomadaire appel\u00e9 le Vinland Voice;\n- J'\u00e9tais en train de finir le Vinland Voice;\n- [...] finissais la page Web pour le Vinland Voice, un journal hebdomadaire de supr\u00e9matie blanche que je fais;\n- J'\u00e9tais juste en train de finir la page d'accueil du Vinland Voice.\n[89] En examinant les journaux, M. Wilson a remarqu\u00e9 que lorsque des personnes se joignaient \u00e0 un dialogue en ligne sur Internet, un code \u00e9tait inscrit sur le journal, un code qui contenait le nom du fournisseur de service Internet (FSI) au moyen duquel ces personnes \u00e9taient capables d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 Internet. Le FSI de WPCanada \u00e9tait une entreprise nomm\u00e9e Execulink. M. Wilson a obtenu un mandat et a saisi les dossiers d'Execulink qui se rapportaient \u00e0 ces \u00e9changes en ligne. Lorsque WPCanada a joint une session de dialogue en ligne au cours de la soir\u00e9e du 13 septembre 2001, un code d'Execulink a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 sur le journal des dialogues en ligne de #wpcanada. Execulink a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Wilson que ce code se rapportait \u00e0 une adresse de protocole Internet qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9e \u00e0 un de ses clients dont le nom d'utilisateur \u00e9tait Cox88. Les dossiers d'Execulink montraient de plus que le nom r\u00e9el de ce client \u00e9tait James Richardson. Les coordonn\u00e9es qu'il avait fournies \u00e0 Execulink montraient que son adresse \u00e9tait l'appartement \u00e0 London o\u00f9 M. Wilson avait trouv\u00e9 et arr\u00eat\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9, M. Richardson, le 28 septembre 2001.\n[90] En prenant en compte toutes ces circonstances, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je suis convaincu que la personne utilisant le pseudonyme WPCanada \u00e9tait en fait l'intim\u00e9, James Richardson, et que M. Richardson participait activement \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction et la production du bulletin d'information Vinland Voice. Je suis en outre convaincu que, avant son arrestation, M. Richardson \u00e9tait l'individu \u00e0 l'origine des articles, des commentaires \u00e9ditoriaux et des autres messages qui \u00e9taient affich\u00e9s sur le site Web du Vinland Voice sous le pseudonyme WPCanada ou de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en tant que r\u00e9dacteur en chef du bulletin d'information. En particulier, je suis convaincu que M. Richardson, en tant que r\u00e9dacteur en chef du Vinland Voice, a affich\u00e9 sur le site Web le r\u00e9cit de la f\u00eate du Tri-City Skins qui a eu lieu \u00e0 Kitchener. Je suis \u00e9galement convaincu qu'il a \u00e9crit l'article du 14 septembre 2001 se rapportant aux attaques terroristes am\u00e9ricaines, l'appel \u00e0 l'utilisation de certains cocktails contre des organisations juives et l'avertissement du directeur de la sant\u00e9 publique \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des Juifs.\n[91] Chose int\u00e9ressante, dans la premi\u00e8re parution du Vinland Voice \u00e0 la suite de l'arrestation de M. Richardson (la parution dat\u00e9e du 6 octobre 2001), WPCanada n'appara\u00eet plus comme r\u00e9dacteur en chef du Vinland Voice. Dans cette parution et dans les diverses autres parutions de d\u00e9cembre 2001 \u00e0 janvier 2002 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve, les articles du r\u00e9dacteur en chef sont sign\u00e9s Totenkopf ou \u00e0 l'occasion Alex Krause. Comme je l'explique ci-apr\u00e8s, je suis convaincu que ces noms sont en fait des pseudonymes utilis\u00e9s par M. Kulbashian. \u00c0 mon avis, le changement de paternit\u00e9 putative qui est survenu apr\u00e8s l'arrestation de M. Richardson le 28 septembre 2001 \u00e9tablit plus solidement la participation de ce dernier \u00e0 la production du bulletin d'information jusqu'\u00e0 ce moment.\n(iii) Le lien entre M. Richardson et M. Kulbashian [92] Durant l'arrestation de M. Richardson dans l'appartement de London, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 parler \u00e0 son avocat par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 les menottes aux mains, mais il a dit \u00e0 M. Wilson que le num\u00e9ro de l'avocat \u00e9tait en m\u00e9moire sur la composition abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. M. Wilson a press\u00e9 le bouton indiqu\u00e9 sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et il a plac\u00e9 le combin\u00e9 sur l'oreille de M. Richardson. D\u00e8s que l'interlocuteur a r\u00e9pondu, M. Richardson a cri\u00e9 dans le combin\u00e9 : [traduction] D\u00e9barrasse-toi de toute la merde. M. Wilson, constatant que M. Richardson l'avait tromp\u00e9 en lui faisant appeler quelqu'un d'autre que son avocat, a imm\u00e9diatement repos\u00e9 le combin\u00e9. Un peu plus tard, le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone a sonn\u00e9. M. Wilson a r\u00e9pondu. L'interlocuteur a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Wilson qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'appareil, et ensuite, apr\u00e8s avoir utilis\u00e9 un langage grossier, a raccroch\u00e9.\n[93] M. Wilson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu'il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son bureau plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0, il a re\u00e7u un appel d'un individu qui a dit \u00eatre Alex Krause. L'interlocuteur a dit que c'\u00e9tait lui qui avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t \u00e0 l'appartement de London. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait un membre du Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team et du Tri-City Skins, et il a dit avec insistance que la cause criminelle contre M. Richardson \u00e9tait sans fondement.\n[94] L'arrestation de M. Richardson est devenue un sujet principal dans la parution du 6 octobre 2001 du bulletin d'information Vinland Voice. Dans l'article Editor's Voice, dont l'auteur mentionn\u00e9 est Totenkopf, le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de M. Wilson \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 et on incitait [traduction] tout partisan \u00e0 lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner et \u00e0 exprimer son d\u00e9go\u00fbt quant \u00e0 l'arrestation de M. Richardson. Il y avait dans l'article une autre remarque visant personnellement M. Wilson et qui faisait mention de sa famille.\n[95] Croyant manifestement que la personne \u00e0 qui M. Richardson avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au cours de son arrestation avait un lien avec l'article en question, un coll\u00e8gue de M. Wilson du service de police de London a appel\u00e9 au m\u00eame num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pour se plaindre de l'article. Un individu nomm\u00e9 Alex a r\u00e9pondu et s'est engag\u00e9, apr\u00e8s certaines discussions avec le policier, \u00e0 retirer l'article du bulletin d'information. M. Wilson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que plus tard le m\u00eame jour, la portion de l'article se rapportant \u00e0 lui avait effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9e du bulletin d'information.\n[96] Apr\u00e8s avoir approfondi l'enqu\u00eate, M. Wilson a appris que le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone que M. Richardson avait appel\u00e9 au cours de l'arrestation \u00e9tait inscrit au nom de M. Kulbashian, avec une adresse \u00e0 North York dans la r\u00e9gion de Toronto. Des recherches quant aux ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de M. Kulbashian ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 de l'information d\u00e9montrant qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 pour une accusation de voies de fait li\u00e9e au racisme. M. Wilson a communiqu\u00e9 avec la police de Toronto et il a obtenu la photographie d'identification prise lors de l'arrestation. Elle d\u00e9montrait qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, M. Kulbashian portait au bras un tatouage d'un svastika entour\u00e9 des mots White Power, de m\u00eame qu'un tatouage d'une t\u00eate de mort, que M. Wilson a reconnu comme une t\u00eate de mort de l'\u00e9poque nazie.\n[97] L'enqu\u00eate de M. Wilson l'a amen\u00e9 en fin de compte \u00e0 conclure que Totenkopf et Alex Krause \u00e9taient des pseudonymes pour M. Kulbashian, et qu'il avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la publication des articles parus dans le Vinland Voice le 14 septembre 2001. M. Wilson a par la suite demand\u00e9 et obtenu des mandats pour l'arrestation de M. Kulbashian (pour des accusations similaires \u00e0 celles port\u00e9es contre M. Richardson) et pour la fouille de sa r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 la maison de ses parents \u00e0 North York. Les mandats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s le 30 janvier 2002. Au cours de la fouille, des t-shirts avec des logos mentionnant le mouvement skinhead ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s dans sa chambre, de m\u00eame que plusieurs cartes professionnelles. Une des cartes indiquait CECT, Totenkopf, Public\/Press Relations. On a \u00e9galement trouv\u00e9 un carnet de notes contenant de nombreux griffonnages de svastikas, de noeuds coulants avec les mots [traduction] pendez-les haut, de m\u00eame que Heil Hitler, niggers, et Aryan Power. Le pr\u00e9nom de M. Kulbashian, Alexan, avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit, mais la lettre X avait une forme qui ressemblait \u00e0 un svastika l\u00e9g\u00e8rement mal form\u00e9.\n[98] M. Kulbashian a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduit au bureau principal du service de police de London, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 par M. Wilson. L'entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e sur vid\u00e9ocassette et une transcription de l'entrevue a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par le personnel de secr\u00e9tariat de la division criminelle du service de police de London. Des extraits de la transcription ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve lors de l'audience. M. Wilson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la transcription refl\u00e9tait exactement les d\u00e9clarations enregistr\u00e9es sur vid\u00e9ocassette. Aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour mettre en doute l'exactitude de la transcription. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, apr\u00e8s que le plaignant et la Commission ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur preuve, les intim\u00e9s ont choisi de ne pas d\u00e9poser de preuve.\n[99] Au cours de l'entrevue avec les policiers, M. Kulbashian a expliqu\u00e9 qu'Affordable Space.com \u00e9tait son serveur et qu'il avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 exploiter cette entreprise deux ans avant son arrestation. Il a d\u00e9crit la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle il a fourni de l'espace sur son serveur au groupe Tri-City Skins et \u00e0 d'autres groupes, notamment au National Skinhead Front et au Canadian National Skinhead Front. Ces groupes utilisaient l'espace pour exploiter leur domaine Web en \u00e9change de frais mensuels de 10 $. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait membre du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'offrir sans frais de l'espace pour le domaine Web de ce groupe. Le site Web du Vinland Voice \u00e9tait \u00e9galement h\u00e9berg\u00e9 sur son serveur.\n[100] M. Kulbashian a dit \u00e0 M. Wilson que parmi les 80 sites Web qu'il h\u00e9bergeait sur son serveur environ 20 \u00e9taient des sites racistes. M. Kulbashian a soulign\u00e9 qu'il ne visitait pas et ne regardait pas tous les sites qui avaient choisi d'utiliser son serveur et qu'Affordable Space.com n'\u00e9tait pas organis\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 servir seulement des sites racistes. Cette entreprise visait \u00e0 offrir de l'espace Web \u00e0 un prix abordable. Cependant, il a \u00e9galement reconnu qu'il ne vendrait jamais de l'espace \u00e0 des groupes affili\u00e9s au groupe Anti-Racist Action. S'il avait appris qu'une telle organisation avait lou\u00e9 de l'espace sur son serveur, il aurait exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir de la retirer de son serveur et il aurait rembours\u00e9 les frais pay\u00e9s.\n[101] Chose int\u00e9ressante, dans un dialogue en ligne qui a eu lieu le 6 septembre 2001, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 sur le journal au nom de fdajews trouv\u00e9 sur l'ordinateur saisi dans l'appartement de London, un participant nomm\u00e9 fdajews demande \u00e0 wpcanada (M. Richardson) pourquoi Alex donnait \u00e0 [traduction] tous ces gens de l'espace Web, des cases postales et ainsi de suite. M. Richardson r\u00e9pond qu'il [traduction] d\u00e9pense beaucoup de son propre argent \u00e0 donner de l'espace Web, ajoutant que : [traduction] nous sommes le meilleur site d'h\u00e9bergement Web de notre mouvement et que c'est au moyen de donations et de d\u00e9vouement que le service est fourni.\n[102] M. Kulbashian a dit \u00e0 M. Wilson, au cours de l'entrevue avec les policiers, qu'il exploitait ses services d'h\u00e9bergement Web par un serveur qui \u00e9tait physiquement situ\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Il faisait cela en partie parce que c'\u00e9tait moins co\u00fbteux et plus avantageux d'un point de vue technique, mais \u00e9galement parce que c'\u00e9tait un moyen d'\u00e9viter d'\u00eatre soumis \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait au courant d'une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal qui avait entra\u00een\u00e9 la fermeture d'un serveur canadien. Il a par cons\u00e9quent [traduction] estim\u00e9 qu'en [traduction] branchant le serveur aux \u00c9tats, il n'aurait pas \u00e0 [traduction] suivre la loi canadienne quant \u00e0 ce que je fais avec mon serveur.\n[103] M. Kulbashian a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 au cours de son entrevue avec les policiers qu'il avait con\u00e7u le mod\u00e8le du site Web du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (wpcect.com). Pour cette raison, on pouvait voir son logo, qui consistait en une t\u00eate de mort avec au-dessous le mot Totenkopf, sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche des pages du site Web. Quant aux documents qui \u00e9taient affich\u00e9s sur le site et le bulletin d'information Vinland Voice, il a reconnu qu'il \u00e9tait l'auteur de tous les documents sign\u00e9s Alex Krause, et d'au moins une portion de ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 Totenkopf. Tous les messages envoy\u00e9s par courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 l'adresse totenkopf @wpcect.com \u00e9taient redirig\u00e9s vers lui.\n[104] Il importe de souligner que sur la page d'accueil du site vinlandvoice.com, le site Web o\u00f9 on peut voir les bulletins d'information, il y a un message remerciant [traduction] Totenkopf, notre administrateur de site entre autres, pour [traduction] son aide et pour son [traduction] soutien continu.\n[105] En fin de compte, le procureur de la Couronne a apparemment d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de retirer les accusations criminelles contre M. Richardson et M. Kulbashian avant le proc\u00e8s. Selon M. Wilson, la Couronne a conclu qu'on ne s'attendait raisonnablement pas \u00e0 obtenir des d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 quant aux accusations port\u00e9es contre eux.\n(iv) Des articles sur M. Richardson et M. Kulbashian dans la presse \u00e9crite [106] Des articles de plusieurs journaux et magazines du sud-ouest de l'Ontario ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve. L'un d'eux a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 le 20 septembre 2001, par The Kitchener-Waterloo Record, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par le journaliste Brian Caldwell. Il rapportait son entrevue avec deux [traduction] tenants de la supr\u00e9matie blanche nomm\u00e9s James Scott, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 27 ans, et Alex Krause, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 20 ans. Par comparaison, au moment de la publication de l'article, M. Richardson \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 27 ans et M. Kulbashian devait atteindre l'\u00e2ge de 20 ans deux mois plus tard, selon les dates de naissance qui apparaissaient sur les pi\u00e8ces se rapportant \u00e0 leurs arrestations.\n[107] Le 3 octobre 2001, le m\u00eame journaliste a \u00e9crit dans The Record un article exposant les d\u00e9tails de l'arrestation de M. Richardson. Le journaliste a de plus fait un compte rendu de son entrevue avec Alex Krause, de Toronto, qui pr\u00e9tendait que lui et M. Richardson \u00e9taient les seuls membres officiels du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, qu'ils ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour avoir un [traduction] r\u00e9seau d'information pour les tenants de la supr\u00e9matie blanche au pays.\n[108] L'entrevue du 20 septembre 2001 avec Brian Caldwell est devenue un sujet de discussion sur les journaux des dialogues en ligne trouv\u00e9s dans l'ordinateur saisi \u00e0 l'appartement de London. On peut voir sur le journal au nom de #wpcanada que M. Richardson (\u00e9galement connu sous le nom de WPCanada) dit \u00e0 un autre participant que Brian Caldwell avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison de sa m\u00e8re pour faire une entrevue avec lui. Il \u00e9crit par la suite qu'Alex et lui ont eu une entrevue de 45 minutes avec le journaliste.\n[109] Dans un autre article, publi\u00e9 le 29 novembre 2001, dans le Now Magazine de Toronto, il y avait une entrevue avec un individu utilisant le nom Alex Krause. L'article \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9 Skinheads on the March - Attacks in Kitchener have Anti-racists Worried (les Skinheads en Marche - Des attaques \u00e0 Kitchener inqui\u00e8tent les anti-racistes). Dans le r\u00e9cit, Krause \u00e9tait d\u00e9crit comme un membre qui [traduction] exploite le serveur que [traduction] Tri-City Skins et d'autres utilisent pour exploiter leurs sites Web.\n[110] Bien que je sois conscient que les rapports que font les journalistes quant aux d\u00e9clarations faites par d'autres personnes doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s avec beaucoup de circonspection, je suis \u00e9galement conscient du pouvoir qu'a le Tribunal suivant le paragraphe 50(3) d'accepter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire. C'est un principe qui s'appliquerait \u00e9galement, d'ailleurs, aux admissions et d\u00e9clarations contre int\u00e9r\u00eat faites par M. Kulbashian dans la transcription de l'entrevue avec les policiers. Le lien entre les renseignements contenus dans des r\u00e9cits de la presse d'une part et les journaux des dialogues en ligne d'autre part appuie davantage la pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle M. Richardson et M. Kulbashian avaient des liens \u00e9troits avec les sites Web sur lesquels les messages de haine ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s.\n(v) Les conclusions du Tribunal \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Richardson et de M. Kulbashian [111] En prenant en compte toute la preuve, j'ai tir\u00e9 les conclusions suivantes \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Richardson et de M. Kulbashian et du degr\u00e9 de leur participation \u00e0 la communication de messages de haine :\nM. Richardson et M. Kulbashian \u00e9taient membres du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. M. Kulbashian exploitait une entreprise, sous le nom d'Affordable Space.com, qui fournissait des services d'h\u00e9bergement Web \u00e0 des sites Web qui incluaient les sites tri-cityskins.com, wpcect.com et vinlandvoice.com. M. Richardson et M. Kulbashian contribuaient au contenu affich\u00e9 sur le site Web du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, soit le bulletin d'information Vinland Voice, sous les pseudonymes WPCanada et James Scott (M. Richardson), de m\u00eame que sous ceux de Totenkopf et Alex Krause (M. Kulbashian). M. Richardson \u00e9tait l'auteur de l'article du 14 septembre 2001, un article se rapportant aux attaques terroristes du 11 septembre 2001, qui, selon ce que j'ai conclu, est l'une des communications comportant des messages de haine. Il ressort de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente des journaux des dialogues en ligne qu'il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le texte de l'article et qu'il l'a affich\u00e9 sur le site Web. M. Richardson, en tant que r\u00e9dacteur en chef du Vinland Voice jusqu'\u00e0 son arrestation le 28 septembre 2001, a affich\u00e9 les commentaires \u00e9ditoriaux contenus dans le bulletin d'information qui, selon ce que j'ai conclu, faisaient partie des messages de haine en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. qui, selon ce que j'ai conclu, font partie des messages de haine en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Il n'y a pas suffisamment d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve permettant de d\u00e9montrer que l'un ou l'autre de M. Richardson ou de M. Kulbashian a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction ou a autrement collabor\u00e9 \u00e0 la documentation affich\u00e9e sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com. Toutefois, M. Kulbashian \u00e9tait au courant que des personnes ou des groupes de personnes agissant d'un commun accord utilisaient ses services Web pour faire de la propagande contrevenant \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, qui incluait des documents affich\u00e9s sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com. Un quart des sites Web h\u00e9berg\u00e9s par M. Kulbashian sur son serveur \u00e9taient, comme il l'a reconnu, de nature [traduction] raciste. M. Kulbashian a admis au cours de l'entrevue enregistr\u00e9e par les policiers qu'il avait de fa\u00e7on intentionnelle utilis\u00e9 un serveur situ\u00e9 physiquement aux \u00c9tats-Unis dans un effort d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 visant \u00e0 \u00e9viter d'\u00eatre soumis \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. de la Loi, un propri\u00e9taire ou un exploitant d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication utilis\u00e9e pour faire de la propagande haineuse ne contrevient pas \u00e0 la Loi du seul fait que des tiers ont utilis\u00e9 ses installations pour communiquer les documents. M. Kulbashian ne peut pas b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cette exception. En plus du fait que j'ai conclu qu'il participait activement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration du contenu affich\u00e9 sur Internet dans le bulletin d'information du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, la preuve d\u00e9montre qu'il encourageait d'autres groupes, qu'il d\u00e9crivait lui-m\u00eame de groupes [traduction] racistes, \u00e0 utiliser ses services. Je suis convaincu qu'il savait exactement quel type de documents ces organisations afficheraient sur Internet, notamment les portions de messages de haine contenues sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com h\u00e9berg\u00e9 par son entreprise, Affordable Space.com. Il appert qu'il a m\u00eame permis \u00e0 ces sites Web de partager la case postale d'Affordable Space.com. M. Kulbashian ne peut par cons\u00e9quent pas pr\u00e9tendre que les messages de haine \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s sur son serveur du seul fait qu'il se trouvait \u00e0 en \u00eatre le propri\u00e9taire. Au contraire, il a favoris\u00e9 et encourag\u00e9 l'utilisation de son serveur pour la communication des messages de haine par ces groupes.\n[112] Je conclus par cons\u00e9quent que M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson, individuellement et agissant d'un commun accord, ont utilis\u00e9 ou fait utiliser de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e Internet pour aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base de leur religion, de leur race ou de leur origine nationale ou ethnique. La plainte suivant l'article 13, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman contre M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson, est fond\u00e9e.\n[113] Lors de leurs contre-interrogatoires des t\u00e9moins de la Commission, M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson ont avanc\u00e9 de temps \u00e0 autre qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9s \u00e0 tort et que, en fait, d'autres individus avaient particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la construction de ces sites Web et au maintien de ces sites. Ni l'un ni l'autre, cependant, n'a choisi de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au soutien de ce qu'il avan\u00e7ait.\n[114] De fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente, il appartient en fin de compte au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9montrer le bien-fond\u00e9 de leur plainte, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Mais, une fois que la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie prima facie, il appartient \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication raisonnable pour d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n'a pas eu lieu comme elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ou que le comportement \u00e9tait d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre exempt de discrimination.\n[115] Il ressort clairement de l'analyse que j'ai effectu\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la preuve, qu'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie contre M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson. Ont-ils fourni une explication raisonnable? Les deux hommes ont mentionn\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de l'audience qu'ils avaient h\u00e2te de pr\u00e9senter leurs versions des faits au moment o\u00f9 ils auraient la possibilit\u00e9 de le faire. Toutefois, lorsque cette possibilit\u00e9 est finalement arriv\u00e9e, ils ont choisi de ne pas pr\u00e9senter d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Le Tribunal ne peut pas faire le point sur de simples suggestions ou insinuations qui ont pu \u00eatre lanc\u00e9es au moyen de questions suggestives formul\u00e9es au cours de leurs contre-interrogatoires des t\u00e9moins de la Commission, s'il n'y a pas en fin de compte d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour soutenir ces affirmations. Ce n'est pas une explication raisonnable.\nE. Cinqui\u00e8me question - La plainte est-elle fond\u00e9e contre les autres intim\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s (Affordable Space.com, Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (CECT) et Tri-City Skins.com)? (i) Affordable Space.com [116] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que M. Kulbashian exploitait, sous le nom d'Affordable Space.com, une entreprise qui offre des services d'h\u00e9bergement de sites Web dont les sites tri-cityskins.com, wpcect.com, et vinlandvoice.com. La preuve n'\u00e9tablit pas clairement si M. Kulbashian exploitait cette entreprise \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire unique, sous la forme d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou sous une autre forme, mais il y avait une certaine indication montrant qu'apr\u00e8s son arrestation, M. Kulbashian a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 l'exploitation d'Affordable Space.com \u00e0 une tierce partie. Toutefois, ind\u00e9pendamment de la forme juridique pr\u00e9cise de l'entreprise, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure qu'il s'agissait d'une personne au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi, capable de se livrer \u00e0 un comportement discriminatoire vis\u00e9 \u00e0 cet article.\n[117] Affordable Space.com n'a pas comparu officiellement lors de l'audience, mais a-t-elle eu un avis suffisant relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance? La preuve, qui va du curriculum vit\u00e6 de M. Kulbashian et de sa d\u00e9claration lors de son entrevue avec les policiers \u00e0 sa participation au site Web du festival du film, \u00e9tablit de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente qu'il \u00e9tait l'exploitant principal - voire le seul - d'Affordable Space.com. M. Kulbashian n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer que son r\u00f4le au sein de l'entreprise \u00e9tait d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre diff\u00e9rent du portrait bross\u00e9 par la Commission et le plaignant. M. Kulbashian \u00e9tait au courant de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Affordable Space.com, et compte tenu de son r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 dans cette entreprise, je suis convaincu qu'Affordable Space.com a eu un avis suffisant relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[118] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu'Affordable Space.com fournissait les services Web qui permettaient la diffusion de messages de haine sur Internet, je conclus qu'Affordable Space.com a fait en sorte que les messages de haine soient communiqu\u00e9s au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi.\n[119] De plus, je ne crois pas qu'Affordable Space.com exploitait une entreprise de communication qui pourrait profiter de l'exception pr\u00e9vue par le paragraphe 13(3). Compte tenu du r\u00f4le majeur que jouait M. Kulbashian dans l'exploitation d'Affordable Space.com, et de la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle il s'adonnait \u00e0 la communication de messages de haine et l'encourageait au moyen de son serveur, Affordable Space.com ne peut pas pr\u00e9tendre que la propagande \u00e9tait faite du seul fait que des tiers ont utilis\u00e9 ses installations. La plainte contre Affordable Space.com est fond\u00e9e.\n(ii) Le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team [120] Je suis convaincu selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qu'une organisation appel\u00e9e Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team existait au moment o\u00f9 M. Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte. Des pages des sites Web wpcect.com et vinlandvoice.com faisaient allusion \u00e0 l'existence du groupe. M. Kulbashian a reconnu au cours de son entrevue avec les policiers qu'il \u00e9tait m\u00eal\u00e9 au groupe, comme l'a fait M. Richardson dans les journaux des dialogues en ligne.\n[121] Tout comme dans le cas d'Affordable Space.com, le Tribunal ne dispose d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant que ce groupe de personnes ait quelque existence l\u00e9gale officielle. Toutefois, comme le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, ce fait change peu les choses. Un groupe de personnes qui acceptent un programme politique et social commun et qui consid\u00e8rent qu'elles font partie d'une institution ou d'un mouvement peut constituer un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord aux fins de l'article 13. J'estime que cette d\u00e9finition est applicable au groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team.\n[122] Le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, m\u00eame s'il n'a pas officiellement comparu lors de l'audience, a-t-il eu un avis suffisant relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance? M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson \u00e9taient des membres principaux du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, comme le confirment l'entrevue avec les policiers, les discussions not\u00e9es sur le journal des dialogues en ligne et les cartes professionnelles saisies lors de leurs arrestations.\n[123] En tant que cointim\u00e9s dans la plainte, M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson \u00e9taient \u00e9videmment personnellement au courant de la plainte contre le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. Je suis par cons\u00e9quent convaincu que le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team a eu un avis suffisant quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[124] Une partie importante des messages de haine \u00e9tait affich\u00e9e sur les sites Web du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team (wpcect.com et vinlandvoice.com). Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires en utilisant ou en faisant utiliser Internet pour communiquer ces messages de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e. La plainte contre le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team est fond\u00e9e.\n(iii) Tri-city Skins.com [125] Le Tribunal ne dispose d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant que Tri-city Skins.com - ou plus exactement tri-cityskins.com - \u00e9tait autre chose qu'un nom de domaine d'un site Web. Ce site \u00e9tait soi-disant utilis\u00e9 par le groupe Tri-City Skins, qui selon M. Warman et M. Wilson, \u00e9tait un groupe de personnes situ\u00e9es dans le sud de l'Ontario. Cependant, le groupe Tri-City Skins n'\u00e9tait pas nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 et je ne dispose d'aucune preuve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa structure.\n[126] La situation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tri-cityskins.com est diff\u00e9rente de celle d'Affordable Space.com. Malgr\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence de la terminaison .com dans son nom, la preuve d\u00e9montre qu'Affordable Space.com est un nom d'une entreprise exploit\u00e9e par M. Kulbashian. En revanche, selon la preuve dont je dispose, tri-cityskins.com n'est qu'un nom de site Web.\n[127] Dans ses observations finales, la Commission semblait pr\u00e9tendre qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le nom du site Web est suffisamment similaire \u00e0 celui du groupe, le Tribunal devrait rendre une d\u00e9cision contre le groupe Tri-City Skins. Je ne partage pas cette opinion. Il serait injuste et inappropri\u00e9 que le Tribunal rende des d\u00e9cisions d\u00e9favorables contre des groupes ou des personnes qui ne sont pas nomm\u00e9s \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9s dans une plainte. Un domaine Web a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9. Seulement une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord peut faire l'objet d'une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9clarant qu'il y a eu de la discrimination suivant l'article 13. \u00c0 mon avis, un domaine Web n'est pas une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, au sens de cette disposition.\n[128] M\u00eame si j'acceptais la proposition de la Commission selon laquelle la d\u00e9signation dans la plainte de Tri-CitySkins.com me permet de rendre une d\u00e9cision contre le groupe Tri-City Skins, cela ne changerait rien \u00e0 ma d\u00e9cision. Rien n'indique que le groupe Tri-City Skins ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u un avis de la pr\u00e9sente instance m\u00eame sous le couvert de Tri-City Skins.com. Selon les renseignements fournis par la Commission, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Richardson et \u00e0 M. Kulbashian de la correspondance pour Tri-City Skins.com, notamment les avis d'audience. Le bureau de poste a retourn\u00e9 les avis. Dans le cas de M. Richardson, il \u00e9tait simplement mentionn\u00e9 sur l'enveloppe qu'elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e. L'enveloppe de M. Kulbashian est revenue avec une mention disant qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e et qu'elle devait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9diteur. Ni l'un ni l'autre n'a accept\u00e9 de recevoir une signification au nom du groupe et ils n'ont pas reconnu \u00eatre en mesure de le faire.\n[129] M. Richardson a admis \u00eatre membre du groupe Tri-City Skins au cours de ses observations finales lors de l'audience, mais je n'ai aucune preuve qu'il ait eu une participation autre \u00e0 ce groupe, notamment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du site Web tri-cityskins.com. Les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve liant M. Kulbashian au groupe sont un article de journal et ce dont M. Wilson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 se rappeler quant \u00e0 un commentaire fait par M. Kulbashian au cours d'une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique initiale, avant son arrestation. Bien qu'il soit vrai que l'adresse postale de Tri-Cityskins.com soit la m\u00eame que celle de l'entreprise de M. Kulbashian, Affordable Space.com, la preuve provenant des journaux des dialogues en ligne et de l'entrevue avec les policiers d\u00e9montre que M. Kulbashian permettait \u00e0 ses autres clients racistes d'utiliser \u00e9galement sa case postale.\n[130] J'estime que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne sont pas suffisants pour \u00e9tablir entre M. Kulbashian et le groupe Tri-City Skins un lien autre que celui de simple membre comme M. Richardson, au mieux. Dans de telles circonstances, je ne pense pas que l'avis envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 de simples membres d'un groupe peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme un avis officiel au groupe. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que la pr\u00e9sence de M. Richardson et de M. Kulbashian lors des conf\u00e9rences pr\u00e9paratoires de gestion de cas pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'audience et lors des audiences elles-m\u00eames \u00e9tablit clairement qu'ils ont eu un avis suffisant quant \u00e0 l'instance contre eux personnellement, je ne peux pas inclure leur connaissance \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans celle du groupe Tri-City Skins.\n[131] Si j'acceptais la proposition de la Commission, cela signifierait que Tri-City Skins serait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de partie \u00e0 la plainte aux \u00e9tapes finales de l'instruction, apr\u00e8s que toute la preuve ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie. Cela serait injuste et constituerait un manquement \u00e0 la justice naturelle.\n[132] Pour tous les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, la plainte contre l'intim\u00e9 Tri-city Skins.com n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nIV. LES REDRESSEMENTS [133] La Commission et M. Warman demandent que le Tribunal rende plusieurs ordonnances suivant le paragraphe 54(1) de la Loi.\nA. Une ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant qu'il soit mis fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire (alin\u00e9a 54(1)a)) [134] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) donne au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ordonner \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables.\n[135] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 M. Kulbashian et \u00e0 M. Richardson, ainsi qu'\u00e0 Affordable Space.com et qu'au groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, de cesser d'utiliser ou de faire utiliser un moyen d\u00e9crit \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, \u00e0 savoir Internet, pour aborder des questions du type de celles contenues dans les messages de haine susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des motifs de distinction illicite.\nB. Une ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (alin\u00e9a 54(1)b)) [136] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) pr\u00e9voit que lorsqu'une victime est identifi\u00e9e dans la communication constituant l'acte discriminatoire, le Tribunal peut ordonner le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, d'un montant maximal de 20 000 $, si le Tribunal en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte pos\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 est un acte discriminatoire qui est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Le plaignant demande cette indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 10 000 $, de M. Kulbashian et du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team.\n[137] Le plaignant \u00e9tait express\u00e9ment nomm\u00e9 dans le bulletin d'information no 12 du Vinland Voice du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2001. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que l'auteur de l'article en question \u00e9tait M. Kulbashian. L'article affichait l'adresse de la r\u00e9sidence de M. Warman et remerciait [traduction] cet avocat juif. M. Warman n'est apparemment pas juif, mais de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente l'auteur le percevait ainsi. L'article continuait en faisant des commentaires cruels sur les victimes de l'Holocauste, notamment sur celles qui, selon ce que supposait l'auteur, \u00e9taient des parents de M. Warman.\n[138] L'attaque \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s personnelle et M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle le pr\u00e9occupait un peu \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux meurtres de victimes de l'Holocauste et l'affichage de son adresse r\u00e9sidentielle dans le bulletin d'information. Il interpr\u00e9tait l'allusion \u00e0 la mort de Juifs dans le pass\u00e9 comme une menace directe \u00e0 sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9. \u00c0 mon avis, et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 mes conclusions ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du bulletin d'information no 12 du Vinland Voice, cette attaque \u00e9tait susceptible de l'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris en tant que personne identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite. Il n'importe pas de savoir si M. Warman est en fait un Juif. Une personne per\u00e7ue comme ayant les caract\u00e9ristiques de quelqu'un qui est vis\u00e9 par l'un des motifs de distinction illicite peut faire l'objet de discrimination m\u00eame si elle n'a pas dans les faits ces caract\u00e9ristiques (School District No. 44 (North Vancouver) c. Jubran, 2005 BCCA 201, au paragraphe 41, autorisation d'appel \u00e0 la C.S.C. refus\u00e9e; voir \u00e9galement Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665). Dans ce contexte, M. Warman est \u00e0 mon avis une victime des messages de haine constituant l'acte discriminatoire.\n[139] Ces d\u00e9clarations \u00e9taient incontestablement des attaques d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9es contre M. Warman, mais je remarque que c'est la seule occasion o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment identifi\u00e9 dans les messages de haine. Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, j'ordonne \u00e0 M. Kulbashian de payer \u00e0 M. Warman une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 5 000 $ suivant l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) de la Loi.\n[140] Quant au redressement demand\u00e9 contre le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team, j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que ce groupe \u00e9tait responsable de la publication du bulletin d'information Vinland Voice, dans lequel figurait l'attaque contre M. Warman. Toutefois, dans l'Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions conjoint d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par la Commission et le plaignant avant l'audience, il n'y avait pas d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale suivant l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) incluse dans la liste des redressements demand\u00e9s contre le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. Cette demande de redressement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois au cours des observations finales. \u00c0 mon avis, compte tenu du manque d'empressement \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter cette demande, il serait inappropri\u00e9 de rendre une ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale par cet intim\u00e9.\nC. Des int\u00e9r\u00eats [141] J'ordonne \u00e0 M. Kulbashian de payer de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat simple sur l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale calcul\u00e9 sur une base annuelle au taux bancaire (s\u00e9rie mensuelle) \u00e9tabli par la Banque du Canada. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat devra courir \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte jusqu'\u00e0 la date du paiement.\nD. Une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire [142] Le Tribunal peut imposer \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 qui s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 13 une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire pouvant atteindre 10 000 $ suivant l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c). Le paragraphe 54(1.1) \u00e9nonce plusieurs facteurs dont le Tribunal doit tenir compte avant de rendre une ordonnance \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il doit tenir compte :\nde la nature et de la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que des circonstances l'entourant; de la nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte, des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de l'intim\u00e9 et de sa capacit\u00e9 de payer. La Commission a demand\u00e9 que la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire maximale soit impos\u00e9e \u00e0 chacun des intim\u00e9s.\n(i) M. Kulbashian [143] La Commission et M. Warman n'ont pas \u00e9tabli que M. Kulbashian participait \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction ou au montage de la propagande haineuse figurant sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com. En fait, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il avait contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 quelque partie des messages de haine figurant sur le site Web wpcect.com ou dans le bulletin d'information Vinland Voice, avant l'arrestation de M. Richardson. Cependant, j'ai conclu que M. Kulbashian a contribu\u00e9 par la suite au contenu du bulletin d'information en r\u00e9digeant plusieurs messages, notamment le message visant directement M. Warman personnellement.\n[144] D'autre part, tous les messages de haine (notamment ceux sur le site Web tri-cityskins.com \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s sur Internet par la participation directe de M. Kulbashian, en tant que fournisseur d'un h\u00e9bergement Web et de services techniques y reli\u00e9s. M\u00eame si sa participation n'incluait pas la r\u00e9daction de la majorit\u00e9 des messages de haine, je suis convaincu qu'il a fait communiquer tous les messages de haine, et qu'il l'a fait de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[145] M. Kulbashian a pr\u00e9tendu que sa sanction p\u00e9cuniaire devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duite compte tenu du comportement qu'il a adopt\u00e9 apr\u00e8s qu'il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la nature de la documentation affich\u00e9e. Ainsi, lorsque le coll\u00e8gue policier de M. Wilson a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Kulbashian pour se plaindre de l'article paru dans le bulletin d'information qui nommait personnellement M.Wilson, M. Kulbashian a fait enlever du site Web la mention dans les heures qui ont suivi. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, M. Kulbashian conteste le fait que M. Wilson, M. Warman et la Commission ne l'ont pas inform\u00e9, avant de d\u00e9poser des accusations criminelles contre lui ou de d\u00e9poser une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, qu'il y avait de la documentation r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible figurant sur le site Web. M. Kulbashian pr\u00e9tend qu'il \u00e9tait trop occup\u00e9 pour v\u00e9rifier la documentation affich\u00e9e sur Internet par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son serveur Web. Il pr\u00e9tend que si on l'avait avis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une plainte concernant les messages de haine, il aurait fait retirer la documentation affich\u00e9e sur Internet aussi rapidement qu'il l'a fait pour l'article du Vinland Voice sur M. Wilson.\n[146] Cependant, cette pr\u00e9tention suppose une fausse na\u00efvet\u00e9 de la part de M. Kulbashian. Il savait qu'un bon nombre de ses clients \u00e9taient racistes. Ils partageaient la m\u00eame case postale que son entreprise, Affordable Space.com. Il \u00e9tait un membre cl\u00e9 du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. Il a reconnu avoir con\u00e7u le mod\u00e8le de son site Web wpcect.com. De plus, M. Kulbashian a \u00e9crit des articles et des commentaires dans son bulletin d'information, le Vinland Voice. \u00c0 lui seul, le nom de ce groupe aurait d\u00fb \u00e9veiller son attention sur la possibilit\u00e9 que les messages affich\u00e9s sur le site Web puissent contrevenir \u00e0 la Loi. De plus, en tant que membre en r\u00e8gle du groupe Tri-City Skins, il \u00e9tait vraisemblablement familier avec le site Web de l'organisation. En fait, il \u00e9tait si conscient de la probabilit\u00e9 que ses clients affichent de la propagande haineuse que l'une des raisons pour lesquelles il a choisi d'utiliser un serveur \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du Canada \u00e9tait de se soustraire \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi.\n[147] Par cons\u00e9quent, c'est de la na\u00efvet\u00e9 pour M. Kulbashian de se pr\u00e9senter aujourd'hui devant le Tribunal et de feindre l'ignorance quant \u00e0 la nature des documents qui \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s au moyen des services d'h\u00e9bergement Web qu'il offrait. Ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de d\u00e9montre au contraire qu'il \u00e9tait au courant du contenu des documents, et qu'il a consciemment et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment donn\u00e9 le moyen de les diffuser. Il s'agit d'un comportement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 au sens de la Loi.\n[148] \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de l'existence d'ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires, m\u00eame s'il y avait une certaine mention dans la preuve qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 pour des voies de fait qui avaient soi-disant un lien avec la haine, je n'ai pas suffisamment de renseignements me permettant de tirer quelque conclusion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[149] La Commission n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la capacit\u00e9 de payer de M. Kulbashian. Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le Tribunal a sembl\u00e9 accepter la proposition selon laquelle il peut appartenir \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer sa capacit\u00e9 de payer la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire. Cependant, dans cette affaire, le Tribunal a pris en compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n'avaient pas fait l'objet d'une d\u00e9claration sous serment ni d'un contre-interrogatoire. Effectivement, le paragraphe 50(3) de la Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 accepter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements par d\u00e9claration sous serment ou par tout autre moyen, selon ce qu'il estime indiqu\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, m\u00eame si M. Kulbashian n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9, il est ressorti, au cours de l'audience, qu'il est un \u00e9tudiant coll\u00e9gial dans la mi-vingtaine qui vit chez ses parents. Il \u00e9l\u00e8ve seul un jeune enfant. Bien que les renseignements disponibles ne soient pas concluants, je crois que les ressources financi\u00e8res de M. Kulbashian sont passablement limit\u00e9es et que sa capacit\u00e9 de payer est par cons\u00e9quent restreinte.\n[150] En prenant tous ces facteurs en compte, j'impose \u00e0 M. Kulbashian une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 1 000 $. Le paiement de la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire devra \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 au moyen d'un ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 ou d'un mandat payable au Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, et doit \u00eatre re\u00e7u au Tribunal dans les 120 jours suivant la notification de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision \u00e0 M. Kulbashian.\n(ii) M. Richardson [151] Il n'y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant que M. Richardson avait un lien avec le site Web tri-cityskins.com. Cependant, j'ai conclu que, jusqu'\u00e0 son arrestation, il participait directement \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction, au montage et \u00e0 l'affichage des messages de haine dans le bulletin d'information du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. La communication de ces messages de haine \u00e9tait de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. Je ne dispose d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'il a des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires.\n[152] Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni officiellement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la capacit\u00e9 de M. Richardson d'effectuer le paiement d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire, mais compte tenu des renseignements glan\u00e9s au cours de l'audience, je suis convaincu qu'il a des ressources financi\u00e8res tr\u00e8s modestes. Il a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il a un [traduction] revenu fixe en raison d'une incapacit\u00e9 non d\u00e9voil\u00e9e. Lorsque le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de tenir une portion de l'audience \u00e0 Ottawa, M. Richardson a \u00e9tabli clairement qu'il n'avait pas les ressources lui permettant de payer les d\u00e9penses de voyage et de logement. Il avait besoin de l'aide d'un parent pour son transport de la maison familiale \u00e0 Hamilton au lieu de l'audience \u00e0 Oakville. Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, j'impose \u00e0 M. Richardson une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 1 000 $. Le paiement de la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire devra \u00eatre fait par ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 ou mandat payable au Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, et doit \u00eatre re\u00e7u par le Tribunal dans les 120 jours suivant la notification de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision \u00e0 M. Richardson.\n(iii) Le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team [153] \u00c0 mon avis, bien que les messages de haine affich\u00e9s sur les sites Web du groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team \u00e9tait passablement moins grave que celle figurant sur le site tri-cityskins.com, ces messages exposaient tout de m\u00eame des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. Ces messages \u00e9taient affich\u00e9s d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment sur Internet, une m\u00e9thode permettant qu'elle soit diffus\u00e9e au plus grand nombre possible de destinataires.\n[154] Je n'ai pas de preuve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question de savoir si le groupe connu sous le nom de Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team s'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 livr\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9 \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires. Je n'ai pas non plus d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa capacit\u00e9 de payer. Dans toutes les circonstances, j'impose au groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team le paiement d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 3 000 $. Le paiement de la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire devra \u00eatre fait par ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 ou un mandat payable au Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Le groupe Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team n'a pas officiellement comparu lors de l'audience, bien que j'aie conclu que M. Kulbashian et M. Richardson \u00e9taient des membres cl\u00e9s de ce groupe. J'ordonne par cons\u00e9quent que le paiement de la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire soit fait au Tribunal dans les 120 jours suivant la date de r\u00e9ception par l'un ou l'autre de M. Kulbashian ou de M. Richardson de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, selon la premi\u00e8re date de r\u00e9ception.\n(iv) Affordable Space.com [155] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu'Affordable Space.com \u00e9tait l'entreprise par laquelle M. Kulbashian fournissait ses services d'h\u00e9bergement Web aux sites Web qui diffusaient les messages de haine, cette entreprise contrevient \u00e0 la Loi dans la m\u00eame mesure que le fait M. Kulbashian. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 imputer le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 du comportement de M. Kulbashian \u00e0 celui de l'entreprise qu'il exploitait. Je ne connais pas la capacit\u00e9 que peut avoir l'entreprise Affordable Space.com de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire et je ne sais pas non plus si elle a des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires.\n[156] Compte tenu de toutes ces circonstances, j'impose \u00e0 Affordable Space.com une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 3 000 $. Le paiement de la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire sera effectu\u00e9 par ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 ou par mandat payable au Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. J'ordonne que le paiement de la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire soit effectu\u00e9 au Tribunal dans les 120 jours suivant la date \u00e0 laquelle M. Kulbashian recevra la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] L'intim\u00e9e, Melissa Guille, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal une requ\u00eate par laquelle elle demande que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l'organisme Canadian Heritage Alliance soit rejet\u00e9e.\n[2] Les parties ont des points de vue tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour qu'il s'agisse d'une personne ou d'un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord suivant le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cette disposition de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait pour une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord d'utiliser une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication pour communiquer des messages susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes identifiables sur la base des motifs de distinction.\n[3] Mme Guille pr\u00e9tend que l'organisme Canadian Heritage Alliance, pour \u00eatre correctement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9, doit \u00eatre un \u00eatre humain vivant ou une soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Toutefois, selon Mme Guille, l'organisme Canadian Heritage Alliance n'est l'un ni l'autre. Cet organisme n'est rien d'autre qu'un site Web que Mme Guille exploite, par elle-m\u00eame, en tant qu'un service \u00e0 des auteurs dissidents.\n[4] Le plaignant et la Commission pr\u00e9tendent que, selon la jurisprudence sur cette question, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'un organisme soit incorpor\u00e9 pour \u00eatre correctement vis\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de partie dans une plainte en vertu de l'article 13. Il existe plut\u00f4t d'autres indices qui sont utilis\u00e9s pour identifier un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord aux fins de l'article 13, par exemple : un nom de groupe, un symbole, du papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate et la question de savoir si le groupe a des administrateurs ou des dirigeants. Le plaignant et la Commission pr\u00e9tendent qu'il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que l'organisme Canadian Heritage Alliance est plus qu'une simple pr\u00e9sence sur Internet. Ils pr\u00e9tendent qu'il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que l'organisme Canadian Heritage Alliance satisfait \u00e0 la plupart des crit\u00e8res pour \u00eatre un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord suivant le paragraphe 13(1).\n[5] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit au soutien de sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Mme Guille a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'affidavit du plaignant. Il y a des diff\u00e9rences fondamentales entre les deux affidavits. Aucun des deux d\u00e9posants n'a subi un contre-interrogatoire.\n[6] Ind\u00e9pendamment de ce que peut \u00eatre la d\u00e9finition de l'expression un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, la jurisprudence \u00e9tablit clairement que les d\u00e9cisions portant sur cette question doivent \u00eatre rendues au cas par cas et doivent \u00eatre appuy\u00e9es sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve appropri\u00e9s.\n[7] \u00c0 mon avis, la question de savoir si l'organisme Canadian Heritage Alliance est un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord pour communiquer les messages contest\u00e9s sera trait\u00e9e plus ad\u00e9quatement lorsque l'audience \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte aura \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue. \u00c0 ce moment, le Tribunal aura l'avantage d'avoir \u00e0 sa disposition un dossier de preuve complet sur lequel il pourra fonder sa d\u00e9cision.\n[8] En outre, il faut noter que la question soulev\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate n'est pas seulement celle de savoir si l'organisme Canadian Heritage Alliance \u00e9tait un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, mais plut\u00f4t celle de savoir si cet organisme \u00e9tait un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord pour communiquer les messages contest\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, une instruction portant sur la question de savoir si l'organisme Canadian Heritage Alliance est correctement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte comprendra probablement un examen d'autres aspects de la plainte, par exemple la communication des messages contest\u00e9s qui sera trait\u00e9e au cours de l'audience \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte.\n[9] Lors de l'audience, il incombera au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs d'une violation du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi, notamment la question de savoir si un groupe de personnes agissant sous le nom de Canadian Heritage Alliance ont agi d'un commun accord pour communiquer les messages contest\u00e9s. Mme Guille aura ensuite la possibilit\u00e9 de contester la preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et de contester la d\u00e9finition de l'expression un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord pour communiquer.\n[10] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, j'ai conclu que la question de savoir si l'organisme Canadian Heritage Alliance est correctement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e apr\u00e8s qu'aura \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue une audience compl\u00e8te \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte.\n[11] La requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Guille est rejet\u00e9e sans qu'il soit port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 son droit de soulever de nouveau la question lors de l'audience \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte.\nKaren A.

Paul Groarke\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Lors d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, Mme la juge Hansen a renvoy\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente affaire au Tribunal afin qu'il traite de toutes les d\u00e9penses admissibles. Les parties n'ont pas pu s'entendre quant \u00e0 deux r\u00e9clamations.\n[2] J'\u00e9tais au d\u00e9part pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que ces r\u00e9clamations \u00e9taient de nouvelles r\u00e9clamations ne m'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement soumises. Toutefois, M. Gordon m'a convaincu qu'il ne s'agit pas de nouvelles r\u00e9clamations. L'instance n'avait simplement pas encore atteint l'\u00e9tape \u00e0 laquelle une liste des d\u00e9penses peut \u00eatre correctement \u00e9tablie.\n[3] La premi\u00e8re r\u00e9clamation concerne les consultations initiales de Mme Brown avec M. Finding. L'intim\u00e9e conteste cette r\u00e9clamation en all\u00e9guant que la d\u00e9cision de la juge Hansen \u00e9tablit clairement que le Tribunal n'a pas le pouvoir d'adjuger des d\u00e9pens pour des services juridiques fournis par une personne qui n'est pas avocat. En r\u00e9ponse, M. Gordon soutient que les consultations initiales sont vis\u00e9es par une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des frais juridiques.\n[4] Le probl\u00e8me est que l'exception s'applique aux frais juridiques qui, selon la d\u00e9cision de la juge Hansen, ne peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s que s'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s \u00e0 un avocat. Pour le moment, je ne peux que pr\u00e9sumer que ce sont des services juridiques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par M. Finding. Il s'ensuit que ses frais ne peuvent pas \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s. Si M. Finding a fourni une autre sorte de services, il devra pr\u00e9senter un affidavit exposant la nature de ces services. Cet affidavit pourrait faire l'objet d'un contre-interrogatoire.\n[5] Le deuxi\u00e8me point se rapporte \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation de frais juridiques. Cette r\u00e9clamation concerne les frais juridiques factur\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante par M. Gordon pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations portant sur la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Je partage l'opinion de M. Gordon selon laquelle je suis li\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision que j'ai rendue ant\u00e9rieurement dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire dans laquelle j'ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'adjuger des d\u00e9pens pour des frais juridiques.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9e a n\u00e9anmoins pr\u00e9tendu que toute r\u00e9clamation de frais juridiques doit suivre le tarif de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. J'ai suivi la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans la d\u00e9cision Brooks c. Minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans, 2005 TCDP 26 (2005-07-12), principalement parce que cette d\u00e9cision traitait d'une r\u00e9clamation complexe \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un montant \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[7] Le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par M. Gordon est relativement peu \u00e9lev\u00e9. Cependant, le fait important est que ce montant est contest\u00e9. Je partage l'opinion de l'intim\u00e9e selon laquelle le tarif devrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 dans les cas o\u00f9 la r\u00e9clamation est contest\u00e9e. La solution de rechange consiste \u00e0 adopter une d\u00e9marche ad hoc qui est plus d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9e et moins en harmonie avec le droit dans ce domaine.\n[8] L'objet du tarif de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est de fournir un cadre m\u00e9thodique, fond\u00e9 sur des principes, suivant lequel des r\u00e9clamations contest\u00e9es peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es. Les dispositions du tarif sont conformes \u00e0 la jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et offrent une d\u00e9marche m\u00fbrement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie qui aiderait quiconque \u00e0 \u00e9tablir quels sont les d\u00e9pens appropri\u00e9s. Je pense que ce serait une erreur de ne pas en tenir compte.\n[9] Je demande par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 M. Gordon de pr\u00e9senter un m\u00e9moire de frais conforme au tarif de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ainsi qu'une lettre justifiant sa r\u00e9clamation. Ces documents devraient \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal au plus tard le 27 mars. L'intim\u00e9e aura jusqu'au 7 avril pour pr\u00e9senter sa r\u00e9ponse. La plaignante aura ensuite jusqu'au 14 avril pour pr\u00e9senter toute autre observation. Dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 M. Gordon souhaiterait pr\u00e9senter un affidavit sign\u00e9 par M. Finding, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 lui fournir un accommodement \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en modifiant les dates \u00e9tablies.\nM.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Dans une plainte dat\u00e9e du 8 juin 2004, M. Richard Warman a pr\u00e9tendu que les intim\u00e9s M. Glenn Bahr et Western Canada for Us, ont viol\u00e9 l'alin\u00e9a 12a) et le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP) en transmettant et en publiant des messages haineux. L'audience de cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 23 mai 2006.\n[2] M Bahr a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant que l'audience de cette cause soit ajourn\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'une d\u00e9cision soit rendue dans Warman c. Marc Lemire (T1073\/5405). Dans cette derni\u00e8re cause, laquelle a \u00e9galement trait \u00e0 de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es violations du paragraphe 13(1) de la LCDP, l'intim\u00e9 a contest\u00e9 la constitutionalit\u00e9 des articles 13 et 54 de la LCDP.\n[3] Le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2005, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans Warman c. Lemire que la contestation constitutionnelle sera trait\u00e9e au cours de l'audience de la plainte et qu'elle ne sera pas trait\u00e9e comme une question pr\u00e9liminaire. Le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2006, le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 le statut de personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 un certain nombre d'organismes afin de permettre \u00e0 ceux-ci de faire part de leurs observations sur la question constitutionnelle (Warman c. Lemire, D\u00e9cision 2006 TCDP 8). Les dates d'audience dans cette cause n'ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es.\n[4] M. Bahr a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il entendait \u00e9galement contester la constitutionalit\u00e9 du paragraphe 13(1) et de l'article 54 de la LCDP. Toutefois, il n'a pas encore signifi\u00e9 d'avis de question constitutionnelle comme l'exige les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[5] M. Bahr pr\u00e9tend qu'attendre que la contestation constitutionnelle soulev\u00e9e dans Lemire soit d'abord r\u00e9gl\u00e9e constituerait une meilleure utilisation des ressources. En outre, il pr\u00e9tend que les questions soulev\u00e9es dans sa plainte sont maintenant sans objet. Le site Web de Western Canada For Us a vraisemblablement \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 en mai 2004 et n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9activ\u00e9. Dans le cadre de ses conditions de libert\u00e9 sous caution d\u00e9coulant d'une accusation port\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 319 du Code criminel, il est interdit \u00e0 M. Bahr d'utiliser l'Internet de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que, non seulement le mat\u00e9riel pr\u00e9tendument offensant n'est plus accessible au public, mais qu'il y a tr\u00e8s peu de risque pour que du nouveau mat\u00e9riel soit affich\u00e9 dans l'avenir.\n[6] Le plaignant et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne s'opposent fermement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Ils pr\u00e9tendent que le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP exige que le Tribunal instruise les plaintes de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Ils pr\u00e9tendent de plus que le Tribunal doit tenir une instruction en pr\u00e9sumant que la loi est valide, et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'un tribunal conclue le contraire.\n[7] Dans L\u00e9ger c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, 26 novembre 1999 (TCDP); demande de sursis rejet\u00e9e [2000] A.C.F. 243 (1re inst.), ce Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que l'exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'accorder un ajournement est r\u00e9gi par les r\u00e8gles de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de la justice naturelle ainsi que par l'\u00e9conomie de la LCDP, laquelle loi privil\u00e9gie la r\u00e9solution rapide des plaintes de discrimination. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada a clairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le public a un int\u00e9r\u00eat consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne statue de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive (Bell Canada c. Syndicat canadien des communications de l'\u00e9nergie et du papier (1997), 127 F.T.R. 44, au paragraphe 44).\n[8] Les arguments de M. Bahr concernant l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et la justice naturelle semblent \u00eatre que les co\u00fbts entra\u00een\u00e9s par une contestation constitutionnelle dans la pr\u00e9sente cause seraient prohibitifs. M. Bahr pr\u00e9tend qu'il sera tr\u00e8s d\u00e9savantag\u00e9 s'il doit rassembler les ressources pour d\u00e9battre cette question compte tenu de ce qui l'attend dans les cours criminelles. M. Bahr pr\u00e9tend, par cons\u00e9quent, qu'on devrait lui permettre d'attendre qu'une d\u00e9cision soit rendue dans Warman c. Lemire avant qu'il ne fasse entendre sa cause.\n[9] Je comprends la situation de M. Bahr. Toutefois, sa requ\u00eate, telle qu'elle est actuellement formul\u00e9e, pose un certain nombre de probl\u00e8mes. Premi\u00e8rement, \u00e0 proprement parl\u00e9, la d\u00e9cision que rendra le Tribunal dans la cause Lemire ne liera pas le Tribunal dans la pr\u00e9sente cause (Donald Lange, The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada, 2i\u00e8me \u00e9dition, Toronto : 2004, p. 423). Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 moins que la question constitutionnelle soumise dans Warman c. Lemire ne se rende jusqu'en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou jusque devant une cour de juridiction plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e, le membre du Tribunal dans la pr\u00e9sente cause doit entendre et d\u00e9cider sur le fond les questions en litige, notamment la question constitutionnelle. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'ajournement de la cause jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le Tribunal rende une d\u00e9cision dans Warman c. Lemire ne procure aucune \u00e9conomie particuli\u00e8re.\n[10] Il s'ensuit qu'il n'existe aucune garantie que la d\u00e9cision que rendra le Tribunal dans Warman c. Lemire procurera \u00e0 M. Bahr ce dont il recherche. Ce n'est seulement que si une d\u00e9cision est rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou par la Cour supr\u00eame quant \u00e0 la question constitutionnelle que le Tribunal sera li\u00e9 par le r\u00e9sultat et que d'autres contestations de la loi devant le Tribunal seront sans objet. Selon moi, l'ajournement de la pr\u00e9sente cause jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la cause Warman c. Lemire ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive retarderait la tenue de l'audience au-del\u00e0 de ce qui est acceptable en vertu de la Loi.\n[11] Pour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate de M. Bahr demandant que l'audience de la pr\u00e9sente cause soit ajourn\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'une d\u00e9cision soit rendue dans Warman c. Marc Lemire est rejet\u00e9e.\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\n[1] Le 24 novembre 2003, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre M. Craig Harrison dans laquelle il pr\u00e9tendait que M. Harrison avait transmis des messages haineux par Internet, et ce, en contravention du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L'audience de cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 3, 4 et 5 avril 2006.\n[2] Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 que l'audience soit ajourn\u00e9e pendant environ quatre \u00e0 six semaines. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne appuie cette requ\u00eate. Le motif de cette requ\u00eate est que M. Harrison nie \u00eatre la personne qui a transmis les messages contest\u00e9s sur Internet. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission et le plaignant ont tous les deux l'intention de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'audience des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui auront trait \u00e0 la question de l'identit\u00e9 de la personne qui a affich\u00e9 les messages contest\u00e9s. Ils d\u00e9clarent qu'ils ont fait de leur mieux pour obtenir ces renseignements le plus rapidement possible mais qu'ils ont r\u00e9cemment r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'ils ont besoin d'une p\u00e9riode suppl\u00e9mentaire d'environ quatre \u00e0 six semaines afin de les obtenir.\n[3] M. Warman a l'intention de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fournis dans le cadre d'un proc\u00e8s criminel mettant en cause M. Harrison. Il affirme que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montreront que l'intim\u00e9 est la personne qui a transmis les messages. Lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas qui a eu lieu le 16 mars 2006 afin que l'on discute de la requ\u00eate du plaignant, M. Warman a mentionn\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fournis au proc\u00e8s fourniront vraisemblablement des renseignements additionnels comme l'adresse de protocole Internet de l'ordinateur utilis\u00e9 pour transmettre les messages en question. Ces renseignements, selon le plaignant, aideront le Tribunal \u00e0 conna\u00eetre l'identit\u00e9 de la personne qui a transmis les messages.\n[4] La Commission, pour sa part, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Bell Sympatico de founir des renseignements concernant l'identit\u00e9 de l'utilisateur de l'adresse de courriel qui accompagnait les messages qui font l'objet de la plainte. On s'attend \u00e0 ce que ces renseignements fassent \u00e9galement la lumi\u00e8re sur la question de l'utilisation qui peut \u00eatre faite de l'adresse de courriel d'une autre personne. Cela, affirme-t-on, est pertinent quant \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 de la personne qui a transmis les messages en cause.\n[5] L'intim\u00e9 s'oppose fermement \u00e0 l'ajournement. Il pr\u00e9tend que la Commission et le plaignant savent d\u00e9j\u00e0 depuis un certain temps que sa d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'encontre de la plainte est une d\u00e9fense d'erreur d'identit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils ont eu amplement le temps d'obtenir les renseignements dont ils avaient besoin avant le d\u00e9but de la tenue de l'audience le 3 avril. Les parties s'\u00e9taient toutes entendues quant aux dates du 3, 4 et avril 2006 et, compte tenu de cela, M. Harrison a pris des dispositions pour prendre cong\u00e9. Il ne peut plus changer ces dates.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend de plus que les renseignements demand\u00e9s ne permettront pas d'\u00e9tablir qu'il est la personne qui a transmis les messages. Enfin, M. Harrison pr\u00e9tend qu'il a encouru des frais importants dans le cadre du processus du traitement de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Il en a assez et il veut que l'affaire soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e le plus rapidement possible.\n[7] J'ai une certaine sympathie pour les arguments de l'intim\u00e9. Il semble que la Commission et le plaignant savent d\u00e9j\u00e0 depuis un certain temps que l'intim\u00e9 nie avoir transmis les messages contest\u00e9s. M. Harrison a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c'est ce qu'il pr\u00e9tend depuis l'enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, dat\u00e9 du 13 janvier 2006, M. Harrison a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il n'a pas affich\u00e9 les messages qui font l'objet de la plainte.\n[8] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Harrison, la Commission a demand\u00e9 des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de M. Harrison qu'il n'a pas transmis les messages. La Commission a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon les renseignements additionnels qu'elle recevra de l'intim\u00e9, elle fera peut-\u00eatre appel \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin expert en informatique ou en sites Web.\n[9] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 4 f\u00e9vrier 2006, l'intim\u00e9 a fourni d'autres d\u00e9tails quant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9fense. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son ordinateur ne fonctionnait pas et se trouvait \u00e0 l'atelier de r\u00e9paration lorsque les messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que d'autres personnes avaient acc\u00e8s \u00e0 son ordinateur.\n[10] Dans son avis de requ\u00eate, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait re\u00e7u les pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires de l'intim\u00e9 le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2006. Lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas visant \u00e0 discuter de la requ\u00eate, M. Warman a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait demand\u00e9 les renseignements imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires de l'intim\u00e9. En raison d'un arri\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le traitement des demandes \u00e0 l'agence qui fournit les renseignements que M. Warman a demand\u00e9s, celui-ci ne pourra pas obtenir lesdits renseignements avant quatre \u00e0 six semaines.\n[11] L'avocat de la Commission a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Bell Sympatico le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2006 afin d'obtenir les renseignements susmentionn\u00e9s. Il a r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par Bell Sympatico qu'il lui faudra attendre de trois \u00e0 quatre semaines avant d'obtenir les renseignements demand\u00e9s.\n[12] Je ne comprends pas pourquoi la Commission et M. Warman ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de poursuivre leurs demandes d'information \u00e0 partir des renseignements fournis dans le premier expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions que l'intim\u00e9 a fourni en janvier 2006. Il ressort clairement de ce document que M. Harrison nie avoir affich\u00e9 les messages au motif qu'ils \u00e9taient incompatibles avec ses valeurs et avec ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents familiaux et au motif qu'il n'avait pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'ordinateur \u00e0 partir duquel les messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente. Je dois dire que je n'ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s satisfaite de l'explication fournie par la Commission et le plaignant lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas.\n[13] Quoiqu'il en soit, je reconnais que les renseignements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9s par la Commission et le plaignant on trait \u00e0 une question qui est primordiale dans la pr\u00e9sente cause - l'identit\u00e9 de la personne qui a affich\u00e9 les messages contest\u00e9s. J'accepte \u00e9galement les d\u00e9clarations de la Commission et de M. Warman qu'il n'y a aucune fa\u00e7on d'obtenir ces renseignements avant le 3 avril 2006, date \u00e0 laquelle l'audience doit commencer. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu que si la demande d'ajournement est rejet\u00e9e la Commission et le plaignant n'auront pas la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter convenablement leur point de vue.\n[14] Pour d\u00e9cider s'il accordera un ajournement, le Tribunal doit prendre en consid\u00e9ration d'une part l'objectif qui consiste \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne en temps opportun et d'autre part l'obligation de faire preuve d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers toutes les parties et de leur donner la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur point de vue (L\u00e9ger c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, le 26 novembre 1999 (TCDP); demande de sursis rejet\u00e9e [2000] A.C.F. 243 (1re inst.)). Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, M. Warman et la Commission demandent un ajournement relativement court afin de pouvoir pr\u00e9senter leur point de vue. Comme on peut le comprendre, M. Harrison sera peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9\u00e7u par l'ajournement, mais la possibilit\u00e9 qui lui est donn\u00e9 de se d\u00e9fendre contre la plainte n'est pas retard\u00e9e ind\u00fbment.\n[15] Pour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate d'ajournement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant est accord\u00e9e. Le greffe du Tribunal a ordre de communiquer avec les parties afin d'organiser une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence visant \u00e0 fixer de nouvelles dates d'audience.\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] J'ai eu la possibilit\u00e9 d'examiner les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les parties sur la question du lieu de l'audience \u00e0 \u00eatre tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[2] La plainte se rapporte \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles les intim\u00e9es, Mme Melissa Guille et la Canadian Heritage Alliance, ont utilis\u00e9 un site Internet pour faire de la propagande haineuse en contravention du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le plaignant, M. Richard Warman, soutient qu'il a visionn\u00e9 le site Web sur un ordinateur \u00e0 Ottawa, o\u00f9 il r\u00e9side. Mme Guille affirme que l'endroit o\u00f9 se trouvait son ordinateur au moment des communications all\u00e9gu\u00e9es \u00e9tait Kitchener ou London, en Ontario.\n[3] Le plaignant demande que la plainte soit entendue \u00e0 Ottawa. \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, il demande que l'affaire soit entendue \u00e0 Toronto. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne adopte la m\u00eame position que celle du plaignant. Mme Guille demande que l'affaire soit entendue \u00e0 Kitchener ou \u00e0 London. \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, elle demande que l'affaire soit entendue \u00e0 Toronto.\n[4] Selon sa pratique habituelle, le Tribunal tient des audiences \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e. Il ne s'agit cependant pas d'une r\u00e8gle stricte et le Tribunal s'efforce de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des parties lorsqu'il est appropri\u00e9 de le faire (Baumbach c. Deer Lake Education Authority, 2004 TCDP 13).\n[5] Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 7, le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 que dans des cas se rapportant \u00e0 l'utilisation d'Internet pour la communication all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de propagande haineuse, comme dans le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce, il est difficile d'\u00e9tablir l'endroit o\u00f9 la discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 soi-disant exerc\u00e9e. A-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 les messages de propagande ont \u00e9t\u00e9 visionn\u00e9s sur l'ordinateur du plaignant? A-t-elle plut\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 se trouve l'ordinateur de l'intim\u00e9 o\u00f9 la propagande a \u00e9t\u00e9 soi-disant communiqu\u00e9e?\n[6] Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Lemire, le Tribunal a conclu que l'endroit ayant le lien le plus \u00e9troit avec le comportement discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e9tait la grande r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9sidait. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9pondu aux besoins des deux parties \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du lieu o\u00f9 serait tenue l'audience dans la grande r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine.\n[7] On peut soutenir que l'endroit le plus \u00e9troitement associ\u00e9 au comportement discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est la r\u00e9gion de London. Le plaignant, cependant, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il subirait des difficult\u00e9s graves s'il \u00e9tait tenu de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une audience dans la r\u00e9gion de London. Bien qu'une audience \u00e0 Toronto entra\u00eene tout de m\u00eame certaines difficult\u00e9s, ces difficult\u00e9s seront moins lourdes. Dans ses observations, Mme Guille a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que m\u00eame si elle pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait que l'audience ait lieu \u00e0 London ou \u00e0 Kitchener, elle accepterait qu'elle ait plut\u00f4t lieu \u00e0 Toronto.\n[8] Les t\u00e9moins et les parties dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire viennent d'Ottawa et de la r\u00e9gion de London, et il est possible qu'un expert, qui n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi, soit appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin.\n[9] Compte tenu des facteurs pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9s, je suis d'avis que la meilleure fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des parties et des t\u00e9moins dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est de tenir l'audience \u00e0 Toronto. L'intim\u00e9e et le plaignant ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 tous deux qu'ils subiraient des difficult\u00e9s importantes si l'audience \u00e9tait tenue au lieu que pr\u00e9f\u00e8re l'autre partie et ils ont propos\u00e9 tous deux que Toronto soit le lieu \u00e9tabli pour remplacer le lieu que chacun pr\u00e9f\u00e8re. La Commission est d'avis que Toronto est un lieu de remplacement acceptable.\n[10] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne que l'audience \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte soit tenue \u00e0 Toronto.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision traite de deux demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9, M. Glenn Bahr, en vue d'obtenir des documents qui sont pr\u00e9tendument pertinents quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui et contre un autre intim\u00e9.\n[2] La plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Richard Warman, se rapporte \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles les intim\u00e9s, M. Glenn Bahr et Western Canada For Us, ont utilis\u00e9 un site Internet pour faire de la propagande haineuse en contravention du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[3] L'intim\u00e9, M. Bahr, a demand\u00e9 que le plaignant communique les documents suivants :\nles notes d'allocution du plaignant intitul\u00e9es Maximum Disruption: Stopping Neo-Nazis by (Almost) Any Means Necessary utilis\u00e9es pour le discours qu'il a prononc\u00e9 lors d'une conf\u00e9rence anim\u00e9e par un groupe nomm\u00e9 l'Anti-Racist Action; la contribution apport\u00e9e par le plaignant au document intitul\u00e9 2005 Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par B'Nai Brith; le contrat du plaignant avec B'Nai Brith se rapportant au document pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9 et \u00e0 d'autres documents; d'autres documents \u00e9crits par M. Warman pour B'Nai Brith.\n[4] L'intim\u00e9, M. Bahr, affirme qu'on peut soutenir que ces documents sont pertinents parce qu'ils peuvent d\u00e9montrer que le plaignant manifeste \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Bahr une animosit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re qui entachera l'instance. Il affirme de plus que les documents sont pertinents quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Warman. L'intim\u00e9, M. Bahr, entend soutenir que la plainte de M. Warman a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de mauvaise foi et qu'elle fait partie d'une campagne visant \u00e0 porter pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ceux qui ont des opinions auxquelles il s'oppose. Finalement, l'intim\u00e9, M. Bahr, soutient que le fait que les notes d'allocution aient \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es et admises en preuve dans l'affaire Warman c. Winnicki (T1021\/0205) donne fortement \u00e0 penser qu'elles sont pertinentes quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[5] Le plaignant et la Commission pr\u00e9tendent qu'on ne peut pas soutenir que les documents sont pertinents \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'ils ne se rapportent pas \u00e0 une question en litige dans la plainte. Dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, le plaignant ne tente pas d'obtenir des redressements pour lui-m\u00eame. Les questions \u00e0 trancher, par cons\u00e9quent, se limitent \u00e0 savoir si les intim\u00e9s ont utilis\u00e9 Internet de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e pour faire de la propagande haineuse et, dans l'affirmative, quel serait le redressement appropri\u00e9. On ne peut pas soutenir que les documents demand\u00e9s sont pertinents quant \u00e0 ces questions.\n[6] J'estime que l'intim\u00e9, M. Bahr, n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'on pouvait soutenir que les documents demand\u00e9s \u00e9taient pertinents quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Bien que le seuil quant \u00e0 la pertinence soit peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 et que la tendance qui se dessine maintenant favorise une communication de documents plus \u00e9tendue que moins \u00e9tendue, il doit n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre \u00e9tabli un lien entre les questions \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer et les documents demand\u00e9s.\n[7] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape lorsque l'on tranche la question de savoir si on peut soutenir qu'un document est pertinent consiste \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les faits qui sont en litige dans l'affaire. La question \u00e0 poser est la suivante : Quels sont les faits \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer pour \u00e9tablir la cause ou se d\u00e9fendre devant le Tribunal? La question de fait essentielle \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est celle de savoir si les intim\u00e9s, agissant individuellement ou d'un commun accord, ont utilis\u00e9 Internet de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e pour communiquer des messages susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des motifs de distinction illicite.\n[8] L'intim\u00e9, M. Bahr, a pr\u00e9tendu que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant est pertinente quant aux raisons qui ont motiv\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter la plainte. Cependant, \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tape de l'instance, les raisons qui ont motiv\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter la plainte ne sont pas en cause. C'est la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne qui a le pouvoir, suivant l'alin\u00e9a 41(1)d), de rejeter une plainte si elle estime qu'elle est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi. Si la Commission n'exerce pas son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pr\u00e9vu par cette disposition et renvoie plut\u00f4t la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction, l'intim\u00e9 peut pr\u00e9senter une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Cependant, le Tribunal n'a pas le pouvoir d'exercer un contr\u00f4le \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal (International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Section maritime), section locale 400 c. Oster, 2001 CFPI 1115, au paragraphe 29). Une fois que la plainte lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e, le Tribunal est tenu suivant le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi d'instruire la plainte.\n[9] Ainsi, les raisons qui ont motiv\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter la plainte ne sont pas une question pertinente \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de l'instance. En outre, le fait que les notes d'allocution aient \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es dans l'affaire Warman c. Winnicki ne signifie pas que les m\u00eames documents doivent \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La question de la pertinence des documents doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e au cas par cas, compte tenu des questions soulev\u00e9es dans chaque affaire. Dans l'affaire Warman c. Winnicki, le plaignant all\u00e9guait que l'intim\u00e9 avait exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles. Le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e9galement une demande d'indemnit\u00e9 personnelle suivant l'article 53 de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, les questions de fait \u00e0 trancher dans l'affaire Warman c. Winnicki \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rentes de celles \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9tabli la pertinence de la question de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[10] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, je refuse d'ordonner la communication des documents pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s. Je note, toutefois, ce que le plaignant a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 dans ses observations, \u00e0 savoir que certains des documents demand\u00e9s sont disponibles sur Internet. Bien qu'il soit apparemment interdit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, en vertu de ses conditions de mise en libert\u00e9 dans une affaire criminelle, d'utiliser Internet, son repr\u00e9sentant a acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet. Par cons\u00e9quent, certains des documents demand\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre obtenus sans l'intervention du Tribunal.\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision concernant la production de documents par des tierces parties. La plainte comporte des all\u00e9gations que l'intim\u00e9, M. Craig Harrison, aurait transmis des messages haineux sur Internet, et ce, en contravention du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[2] Le plaignant, Richard Warman, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate dans laquelle il demande que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 une personne qui n'est pas partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte, M. Marc Lemire, de produire des documents ayant trait aux pseudonymes qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le plaignant affirme que ces renseignements sont pertinents et essentiels \u00e0 la preuve relative \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 de la personne qui a transmis les messages qui violeraient le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi.\n[3] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que, en vertu des paragraphes 50(2) et 50(3) de la Loi, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'ordonner \u00e0 des personnes qui ne sont pas parties \u00e0 l'instance de produire des documents. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette opinion.\n[4] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi exige que le Tribunal tienne une instruction sur les plaintes qui lui sont renvoy\u00e9es par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Le paragraphe 50(2) accorde au Tribunal le pouvoir de trancher les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi. Le paragraphe 50(3) accorde au Tribunal des pouvoirs additionnels pour lui permettre de tenir une instruction approfondie. L'alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) accorde notamment au Tribunal le pouvoir d'assigner et de contraindre les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, \u00e0 d\u00e9poser verbalement ou par \u00e9crit et \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces qu'il juge indispensables \u00e0 l'examen complet de la plainte. L'alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) permet au Tribunal de recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire. Ces dispositions ne donnent pas au Tribunal le pouvoir d'obliger des personnes qui ne sont pas t\u00e9moins ou parties \u00e0 l'instance \u00e0 produire des documents. Le nom de M. Lemire ne figure pas dans la liste des t\u00e9moins en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[5] Le plaignant invoque la d\u00e9cision Metcalf c. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 882 and others (no 7) 2005 BCHRT 165 pour justifier l'affirmation que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'ordonner \u00e0 des tierces parties de produire des documents. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette opinion. Metcalfe (no 7) est une d\u00e9cision du British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. Ce Tribunal est r\u00e9gi par des lois tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes. Le British Columbia Human Rights Code a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment modifi\u00e9 par l'ajout d'une disposition de la Administrative Tribunal Act, S.B.C. 2004, ch. 45 qui conf\u00e8re express\u00e9ment au British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal le pouvoir d'ordonner \u00e0 des tierces parties de produire des documents. Le Tribunal, dans Metcalfe (no 7), a soulign\u00e9 que, avant que cette modification ne soit apport\u00e9e, il n'avait pas le pouvoir d'ordonner \u00e0 des tierces parties de produire des documents et que c'\u00e9tait pour cette raison qu'il avait refus\u00e9 d'ordonner la production de documents.\n[6] Selon moi, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne n'a pas le pouvoir d'ordonner \u00e0 des tierces parties qui ne sont pas t\u00e9moins de produire des documents. Pour ce motif, je refuse d'ordonner la production des documents demand\u00e9e par le plaignant dans sa requ\u00eate.\nKaren A.

Grant Sinclair\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] L'intim\u00e9e, la Banque Royale du Canada (BRC) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal pour lui demander de radier la nouvelle all\u00e9gation de discrimination qu'a faite la plaignante en rapport avec le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996.\n[2] Les motifs de la requ\u00eate sont les suivants : la plaignante et la Commission ont r\u00e9cemment fait valoir un nouveau motif de discrimination qui ne faisait pas partie de la plainte initiale, la BRC n'a pas eu l'occasion de soulever l'objection que la nouvelle all\u00e9gation est inopportune, et, le fait de soulever la nouvelle all\u00e9gation de discrimination \u00e0 ce moment-ci viole les r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle et pr\u00e9judicie grandement la BRC.\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9plique que le Tribunal d\u00e9cline comp\u00e9tence d'entendre la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e, ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, d\u00e9clare que la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e et qu'il r\u00e9serve le droit de l'intim\u00e9e de plaider la requ\u00eate \u00e0 la fin de l'audience sur un dossier de preuve complet.\n[4] La plainte mentionn\u00e9e dans les requ\u00eates est celle d'Yvonne Sugimoto, une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 la retraite de la BRC. Sa plainte est dat\u00e9e du 9 d\u00e9cembre 2002.\n[5] La plaignante pr\u00e9tend que la BRC a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de 700 autres employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin qui sont actuellement \u00e0 l'emploi de la BRC, et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'anciens employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin, en les traitant d'une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente et d\u00e9favorable en raison de leur sexe, et ce, en contravention des articles 7, 10 et 21 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). La question en litige a trait \u00e0 leur droit \u00e0 une pension.\n[6] La plaignante fait \u00e9tat, d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, de l'\u00e9volution du r\u00e9gime de retraite de la BRC entre 1970 et 2001, notamment des modifications aux crit\u00e8res de participation ainsi que des autres modifications apport\u00e9es au r\u00e9gime.\n[7] Sur le plan des all\u00e9gations de discrimination, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend que la modification apport\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime par la r\u00e9ouverture de septembre 2001est discriminatoire car la BRC a choisi de donner un avantage aux employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin, n\u00e9s entre f\u00e9vrier 1950 et avril 1953, en leur permettant de prendre leur retraite avec pension compl\u00e8te \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 56 ans. Les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin qui occupent des postes semblables ne peuvent prendre leur retraite avec pension compl\u00e8te qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 61 ans et 10 mois.\n[8] La gen\u00e8se de la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e se trouve dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 25 mai 2005 qu'elle a adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission ainsi qu'\u00e0 la plaignante. Dans sa lettre, la BRC mentionnait ce qui suit : [Traduction] Nous avons appris que la Commission et (ou) la plaignante pr\u00e9tendent que le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996 offert aux employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin de la banque, dont fait notamment partie la plaignante, \u00e9tait discriminatoire et contrevenait aux dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La BRC, dans sa lettre, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 la plaignante de pr\u00e9ciser leur position. La BRC ne mentionnait pas dans sa lettre \u00e0 quel moment et de quelle mani\u00e8re le renseignement susmentionn\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 son attention.\n[9] La pr\u00e9cision apport\u00e9e par la Commission, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e le 30 mai 2005, \u00e9tait que la conjugaison de la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 et du rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996 a eu un effet d\u00e9favorable sur les femmes. Cet effet d\u00e9favorable constitue en soi de la discrimination au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP.\n[10] Le 31 mai 2005, la plaignante a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle a toujours pr\u00e9tendu que le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996 ainsi que la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 sont des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui sont intimement li\u00e9s et qui ne peuvent pas \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9s. C'est la conjugaison de ces deux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui a eu un effet d\u00e9favorable sur les femmes, en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. La plaignante a ajout\u00e9 que, elle-m\u00eame et d'autres femmes, auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre admissibles au choix offert en 2001 quant au r\u00e9gime de retraite.\n[11] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par la BRC le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1970. Elle est n\u00e9e le 4 octobre 1951. Lorsqu'elle s'est jointe \u00e0 la BRC, elle avait 18 ans et 4 mois. En 1970, l'\u00e2ge d'admissibilit\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime \u00e9tait de 21 ans pour les hommes et de 24 ans pour les femmes.\n[12] Le 1er mai 1974, la BRC a modifi\u00e9 le r\u00e9gime. L'\u00e2ge d'admissibilit\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 30 ans, tant pour les hommes que pour les femmes. Le r\u00e9gime a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 afin d'offrir un choix sans cotisation. Ce choix permettait aux employ\u00e9s qui cotisait au r\u00e9gime, mais qui n'avaient pas encore atteint l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans, de continuer \u00e0 cotiser ou de surseoir \u00e0 leur cotisation jusqu'\u00e0 qu'ils aient atteint l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans. La plaignante ne s'est pas vu offrir ce choix de suspension de cotisation au r\u00e9gime. Elle ne cotisait pas au r\u00e9gime en date du 1er mai 1974. Elle n'avait pas 24 ans.\n[13] Le 1er septembre 1980, le r\u00e9gime a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 une fois de plus et l'\u00e2ge d'admissibilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 la date la plus rapproch\u00e9e entre l'\u00e2ge de 25 ans ou 5 ann\u00e9es d'emploi continu \u00e0 la BRC. \u00c0 la date susmentionn\u00e9e, la plaignante \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de la BRC depuis plus de 10 ans et \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9e de 28 ans et 9 mois. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 cotiser au r\u00e9gime \u00e0 compter du 1er mars 1980.\n[14] En 1996, la BRC, afin de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 pass\u00e9e dans les prestations de retraite, a offert aux femmes qui avaient travaill\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on continue pour la BRC depuis le 1er mai 1974, et qui avaient entre 21 et 24 ans le 1er mai 1974, une occasion unique de racheter jusqu'\u00e0 trois ann\u00e9es de cotisation au r\u00e9gime. C'est ce qu'on a appel\u00e9 le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service de 1996 bas\u00e9 sur le sexe.\n[15] La plaignante s'est pr\u00e9value de ce choix et le 29 janvier 1996 elle a rachet\u00e9 19 mois de cotisation au r\u00e9gime de retraite moyennant le paiement d'une somme de 4 834 $. La plaignante s'est vu attribuer le 1er ao\u00fbt 1978 comme date pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de cotisation au r\u00e9gime.\n[16] Le 12 juillet 1996, la plaignante a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la BRC pour la f\u00e9liciter quant \u00e0 sa tentative d'\u00e9limination de la diff\u00e9rence de traitement entre les sexes. Elle a toutefois soulign\u00e9, dans sa lettre, que le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe n'avait pas \u00e9limin\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence de traitement entre les sexes qui existait dans le r\u00e9gime entre le 1er mai 1974 et le 1er mars 1980. Le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe a r\u00e9duit de 19 mois l'\u00e9cart de traitement entre les sexes, mais il existait toujours un \u00e9cart de 72 mois quant \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge et quant \u00e0 l'emploi entre les hommes et les femmes qui occupaient des postes semblables \u00e0 la BRC.\n[17] La plaignante a conclu sa lettre en demandant \u00e0 la BRC quels \u00e9taient les efforts qu'elle d\u00e9ployait afin d'\u00e9liminer cet \u00e9cart dans les prestations de retraite.\n[18] La BRC a r\u00e9pondu aux questions de la plaignante le 17 septembre 1996. Dans sa lettre, la BRC a soulign\u00e9 qu'elle avait examin\u00e9, lorsqu'elle a \u00e9labor\u00e9 le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996, la possibilit\u00e9 de permettre aux employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin de racheter des ann\u00e9es de service apr\u00e8s le 1er mai 1974 jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans. La BRC a toutefois conclu qu'il serait injuste d'agir de la sorte pour les autres employ\u00e9s qui ont cotis\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime depuis le 1er mai 1974 et qui ont choisi de surseoir \u00e0 leur cotisation jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans.\n[19] La plaignante n'a pris aucune autre mesure \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque en rapport avec ses pr\u00e9occupations.\n[20] Dans les ann\u00e9es 90, la BRC a conclu que la modification du 1er mai 1974 peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme comportant un troisi\u00e8me choix. En vertu de ce troisi\u00e8me choix, un employ\u00e9 de la BRC, de sexe masculin ou de sexe f\u00e9minin, \u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de 30 ans le 1er mai 1974, qui cotisait au r\u00e9gime, pouvait continuer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime sans cotiser, et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il atteigne l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, le 26 septembre 2001, la BRC a offert \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 son emploi sans interruption depuis le 1er mai 1974, et qui avaient choisi de surseoir \u00e0 leur cotisation au r\u00e9gime jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans, le choix de recevoir un service non cotisant \u00e9gal \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode comprise entre la date de la suspension et la date o\u00f9 ils ont atteint l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans (jusqu'\u00e0 un maximum de 70 mois).\n[22] C'est la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 qui, selon la plaignante, est discriminatoire. Elle pr\u00e9tend qu'elle accorde une prestation de retraite importante aux employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin de la BRC, n\u00e9s entre f\u00e9vrier 1950 et avril 1953, qui ont travaill\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ininterrompue et que cette prestation n'est pas accord\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin de la BRC n\u00e9es entre ces dates et ayant \u00e0 leur actif la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de travail ininterrompu.\nLA D\u00c9CISION [23] Selon moi, la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9 est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. Elle devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e dans le contexte d'une preuve compl\u00e8te apr\u00e8s qu'une audience au fond de la plainte ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue. J'affirme cela pour un certain nombre de raisons.\n[24] Premi\u00e8rement, on ne pr\u00e9tend aucunement dans la plainte que le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996 \u00e9tait discriminatoire en soi. Ni la Commission, ni la plaignante, dans leurs pr\u00e9cisions, ne pr\u00e9tendent que le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996 est discriminatoire en soi.\n[25] Pour la Commission, c'est le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996 conjugu\u00e9 avec la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 qui sont discriminatoires. Pour la plaignante, ces deux modifications apport\u00e9es au r\u00e9gime sont intimement li\u00e9es et c'est la conjugaison de celles-ci qui est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e source de discrimination. Selon moi, les positions de la Commission et de la plaignante sur cette question exigent des pr\u00e9cisions additionnelles.\n[26] Deuxi\u00e8mement, et tout aussi pertinent, l'affirmation de la plaignante qu'elle a toujours pr\u00e9tendu que les modifications de 1996 et de 2001 \u00e9taient intimement li\u00e9es. Le raisonnement est qu'aucune nouvelle all\u00e9gation de discrimination n'est soulev\u00e9e. La question de savoir si c'est le cas dans les faits et la question de savoir si l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate par les parties \u00e0 l'audience de la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e et doivent \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9es.\n[27] Troisi\u00e8mement, le processus normal de gestion de cas du Tribunal n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 achev\u00e9e. En vertu de ce processus, les parties doivent proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la divulgation. La divulgation comprend le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des documents pertinents, la divulgation des t\u00e9moignages et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[28] L'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions s'apparente \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration et \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense dans une instance civile. L'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission et de la plaignante expose en d\u00e9tails les faits invoqu\u00e9s par ces deux parties, les questions en litige soulev\u00e9es ainsi que le redressement demand\u00e9. L'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l'intim\u00e9e constituerait sa r\u00e9ponse comme c'est le cas de toute d\u00e9fense. Toute divulgation a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue en attendant l'issu de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[29] L'intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal de radier la nouvelle all\u00e9gation de discrimination avant qu'une plaidoirie ne soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9e; l'all\u00e9gation n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e que dans la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre les avocats des parties.\n[30] En outre, selon le redressement demand\u00e9 par la Commission et la plaignante, il ne sera peut-\u00eatre pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996 est discriminatoire.\n[31] Il est toutefois possible que l'on me demande de rendre une d\u00e9cision de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9liminaire qui tranchera la plainte sur le fond sans qu'une audience en bonne et due forme ne soit tenue. Il ne convient pas que le Tribunal rende une telle d\u00e9cision dans les circonstances susmentionn\u00e9es.\n[32] Par cons\u00e9quent, je r\u00e9serve ma d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e et quant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la Commission jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'un dossier de preuve complet soit \u00e9tabli dans le cadre d'une audience.\n[33] Cette d\u00e9cision ne pr\u00e9judicie pas les droits de l'intim\u00e9e et de la Commission de d\u00e9battre leur requ\u00eates respectives, sur un dossier complet, dans le cadre de leurs observations finales.\nJ.

LES PLAINTES [1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision concernant deux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par M. Richard Warman contre M. Tomasz Winnicki. La premi\u00e8re plainte porte sur la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e diffusion de messages haineux en contravention du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). La deuxi\u00e8me plainte porte sur des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles ou de menaces de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de l'intim\u00e9 en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[2] J'ai entendu les deux plaintes conjointement en juillet et d\u00e9cembre 2005. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a pleinement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Le plaignant, un avocat, s'est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame. L'intim\u00e9 s'est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame lors de la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d'audience, puis, par la suite, il s'est fait repr\u00e9senter par une avocate. L'intim\u00e9 a choisi de ne pas t\u00e9moigner.\nII. QUELLES SONT LES CIRCONSTANCES QUI ONT DONN\u00c9 NAISSANCE AUX PR\u00c9SENTES PLAINTES? [3] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, il y a 15 ans environ, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'int\u00e9resser \u00e0 la question de la propagande haineuse. Il a commenc\u00e9 par surveiller les activit\u00e9s, au Canada, de groupes organis\u00e9s et de personnes qu'il soup\u00e7onnait de diffuser des messages haineux.\n[4] Au cours de ses activit\u00e9s de surveillance, le plaignant a d\u00e9couvert des documents Internet qui \u00e9taient apparemment affich\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9, M. Tomasz Winnicki. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, selon lui, ces documents contrevenaient au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, lequel a trait \u00e0 la propagande haineuse, car ils \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer les Juifs \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. Par cons\u00e9quent, le 7 septembre 2003, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Il a joint, \u00e0 sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1), des documents qu'il avait t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9s d'Internet, lesquels documents auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9.\n[5] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a par la suite d\u00e9couvert d'autres messages sur Internet qui, selon lui, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 en repr\u00e9sailles contre lui parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Le plaignant a alors d\u00e9pos\u00e9, aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles dat\u00e9e du 1er juin 2004 dans laquelle il a pr\u00e9tendu que l'intim\u00e9 avait viol\u00e9 l'article 14.1 de la Loi. Le plaignant a joint les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s messages de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 14.1.\n[6] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a par la suite d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer les deux plaintes au Tribunal afin que celui-ci les examine d'une mani\u00e8re plus approfondie. Apr\u00e8s que la Commission eut renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes au Tribunal, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a trouv\u00e9 d'autres documents sur Internet qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9. On croyait que ces documents \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris pour des motifs fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique et la couleur. Par cons\u00e9quent, le 20 mai 2005, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal l'autorisation de modifier la premi\u00e8re plainte afin d'y ajouter les motifs suppl\u00e9mentaires de la race, de l'origine nationale ou ethnique et de la couleur. L'intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u signification de la requ\u00eate ainsi que des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts dans Internet.\n[7] Le 11 juillet 2005, j'ai accueilli la demande de la Commission quant \u00e0 la modification de la plainte qu'elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) au motif que l'objet de la plainte initiale n'\u00e9tait pas modifi\u00e9 par l'ajout des nouveaux motifs; il n'\u00e9tait fait mention d'aucun autre acte discriminatoire. J'ai \u00e9galement estim\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 avait obtenu un avis suffisant pour qu'il puisse se d\u00e9fendre ad\u00e9quatement contre la plainte modifi\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e pour y inclure les motifs additionnels et de nouveaux documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 joints \u00e0 la plainte modifi\u00e9e.\n[8] Apr\u00e8s que la modification fut apport\u00e9e, mais avant la tenue de l'audience, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait d\u00e9couvert d'autres documents qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur Internet par l'intim\u00e9. L'existence de ces documents a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 avant la tenue de l'audience et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que ces documents constituaient des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels de la violation continue par l'intim\u00e9 du paragraphe 13(1) et de l'article 14.1 (par souci de commodit\u00e9, tous les documents d\u00e9couverts sur Internet apr\u00e8s que la plainte fut renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, notamment les documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 joints \u00e0 la plainte modifi\u00e9e, seront appel\u00e9s \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi).\n[9] Le 27 juillet 2005, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, une requ\u00eate en injonction interlocutoire contre l'intim\u00e9 en attendant qu'une d\u00e9cision finale soit rendue par le Tribunal. Le 4 octobre 2005, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accueilli la requ\u00eate de la Commission et, par cons\u00e9quent, entre cette date et la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, il fut interdit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de diffuser, par Internet, des messages du genre de ceux qui figurent dans les documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Winnicki 2005 CF 1493).\n[10] Le plaignant et la Commission ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de cesser de diffuser des messages du genre de ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s avec les plaintes. Ils ont \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral que le plaignant aurait subi par suite des repr\u00e9sailles. Ils ont \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale et le remboursement des frais engag\u00e9s par le plaignant pour assister \u00e0 l'audience.\n[11] L'intim\u00e9, par l'entremise de son avocate, a avou\u00e9 avoir diffus\u00e9 les messages qui ont fait l'objet des plaintes initiales d\u00e9pos\u00e9es le 7 septembre 2003 et le 1er juin 2004. L'intim\u00e9 s'est toutefois oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'examen par le Tribunal de tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve post\u00e9rieur au renvoi au motif qu'il ne fait pas partie de la plainte initiale. L'intim\u00e9 a ni\u00e9 que l'un ou l'autre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve exposait les membres d'un groupe identifiable \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. Il a \u00e9galement ni\u00e9 avoir exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant parce que celui-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre lui. Enfin, l'intim\u00e9 a contest\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re opportun des recours demand\u00e9s par le plaignant et la Commission.\nIII. QUELLES SONT LES QUESTIONS QUI DOIVENT \u00caTRE EXAMIN\u00c9ES EN L'ESP\u00c8CE? [12] En l'esp\u00e8ce, je dois examiner les questions suivantes :\nLe Tribunal est-il autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 se prononcer quant \u00e0 des documents qui ne figurent pas dans la plainte initiale? Quelles sont les sources des documents qui violent cens\u00e9ment le paragraphe 13(1)? L'intim\u00e9 a-t-il diffus\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e sur Internet les messages contest\u00e9s? Les documents sont-ils susceptibles d'exposer des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris parce que celles-ci sont identifiables sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite? L'intim\u00e9 a-t-il exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant apr\u00e8s que celui-ci eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne?\n[13] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j'ai conclu que l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, diffus\u00e9, au moyen d'Internet, des messages qui sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes de confession juive, des personnes d'origine africaine, des personnes de race noire ainsi que d'autres personnes n'appartenant pas \u00e0 la race blanche. J'ai \u00e9galement conclu que l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant parce que celui-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que les deux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre l'intim\u00e9 sont justifi\u00e9es.\nA. Premi\u00e8re question - Le Tribunal est-il autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 se prononcer quant \u00e0 des documents qui ne figurent pas dans la plainte initiale? [14] Bien que l'intim\u00e9 ne se soit pas oppos\u00e9 lorsque, durant l'audience, la Commission a introduit les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi, celui-ci, \u00e0 la fin de l'audience, a pr\u00e9tendu que le Tribunal ne pouvait pas examiner ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve car ils constituaient essentiellement le fondement de nouvelles plaintes qui auraient d\u00fb d'abord \u00eatre soumises \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[15] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cet argument, et ce, pour un certain nombre de raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, l'intim\u00e9 cherche essentiellement \u00e0 remettre en cause la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte initiale d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1). La requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie sur le fondement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui de cette requ\u00eate. En d\u00e9cidant qu'il convenait de modifier la plainte initiale, la question de savoir si ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve constituaient le fondement d'une nouvelle plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive. \u00c0 la suite de cette d\u00e9cision, des extraits des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9s dans les pr\u00e9cisions sur la plainte modifi\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, on ne saurait maintenant pr\u00e9tendre que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont constitu\u00e9 le fondement de la modification constituent, en fait, le fondement d'une nouvelle plainte. Il s'agirait l\u00e0 d'une tentative de remise en cause de la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte. Cela \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure et ne sera pas autoris\u00e9 (Cremasco c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes 2002\/09\/30 - D\u00e9cision no 1, par. 77, conf. par 2004 CAF 363).\n[16] Deuxi\u00e8mement, en ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s apr\u00e8s la modification de la plainte, je crois qu'ils peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s \u00e0 juste titre par le Tribunal. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne constituent pas le fondement d'une nouvelle plainte ou d'une nouvelle s\u00e9rie de plaintes et sont pertinents quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si l'intim\u00e9 s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une violation continue de l'article 14.1 et du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. La plainte modifi\u00e9e d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment la possibilit\u00e9 que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels de la violation du paragraphe 13(1) soient apport\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'ajout des mots et par la suite dans la date du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 acte discriminatoire.\n[17] Dans LeBlanc c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (1992), 18 C.H.R.R. D\/57, le Tribunal a discut\u00e9 d'une objection analogue \u00e0 celle soulev\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce par l'intim\u00e9. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle avait l'intention de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve quant \u00e0 d'autres incidents de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s dans le formulaire de plainte. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 s'est oppos\u00e9. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9taient admissibles parce que le formulaire de plainte renvoyait \u00e0 des incidents de discrimination qui se poursuivaient toujours et que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve semblaient constituer le prolongement de la plainte. En outre, le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Commission et le plaignant n'\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessairement limit\u00e9s aux all\u00e9gations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la plainte elle-m\u00eame. La question essentielle consiste \u00e0 savoir s'il serait juste d'accepter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. S'il n'y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve surprise et que l'intim\u00e9 sait que la plainte a trait \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e8nements en cours, alors il est difficile pour l'intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9tendre qu'il subit un pr\u00e9judice.\n[18] En l'esp\u00e8ce, rien ne prouve que l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris par surprise par l'introduction des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Ils lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s avant la tenue de l'audience et, comme il est mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, le formulaire de plainte modifi\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) mentionnait que la plainte avait trait \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements en cours. Enfin, la demande d'injonction interlocutoire adress\u00e9e par la Commission \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale indiquait clairement \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 que la Commission s'opposait \u00e0 la diffusion continue de documents \u00e0 laquelle il se livrait. Il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que cette diffusion violait le paragraphe 13(1).\n[19] Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans le formulaire de plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 14.1 que la plainte avait trait \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements en cours. Toutefois, j'estime que, dans le contexte de la diffusion continue qui se d\u00e9roulait avant la tenue de l'audience et que, dans le contexte des requ\u00eates qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal et \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, cela n'est pas important. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonnant que l'intim\u00e9 soit surpris du fait que tous les messages qu'on a d\u00e9couverts sur Internet et qu'on a estim\u00e9s comme constituant des repr\u00e9sailles puissent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve \u00e0 l'audience.\n[20] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de se livrer \u00e0 une tentative de conciliation et de la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9agir devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne quant aux messages post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi. Cet argument est mal fond\u00e9. Les messages post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi sont de la m\u00eame nature que ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la Commission dans le cadre des plaintes initiales. L'intim\u00e9 aurait eu la possibilit\u00e9 de se livrer \u00e0 une tentative de conciliation et la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9agir quant aux messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis dans le cadre de la plainte initiale. Il est peu probable que les documents additionnels auraient fait une quelconque diff\u00e9rence quant aux tentatives de conciliation et de r\u00e8glement.\n[21] La pr\u00e9sente cause est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente de la cause Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) (1991), F.T.R. 47 (Pitawanakwat) qui est invoqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui de son argument que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi. La d\u00e9cision Pitawanakwat a trait \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission de renvoyer au Tribunal, environ quatre ans apr\u00e8s la signification de la plainte initiale, une plainte modifi\u00e9e qui comprend une nouvelle all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif diff\u00e9rent. Cette cause ne traite pas de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'accepter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi.\n[22] Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont trait \u00e0 la question du caract\u00e8re continu des violations et compte tenu du fait que l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment avis\u00e9 et qu'il a eu l'occasion d'analyser les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi, j'estime que le Tribunal a le droit d'examiner les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi.\nB. Deuxi\u00e8me question - Quelles sont les sources des documents qui violent cens\u00e9ment le paragraphe 13(1)? [23] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les messages contest\u00e9s proviennent essentiellement de trois sources : le livre des visiteurs de la Northern Alliance, le site Web de l'intim\u00e9 et le Vanguard News Network. La plus grande partie des messages contest\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts dans le groupe de discussion du VNN. Toutefois, un certain nombre de messages proviennent du livre des visiteurs de la Northern Alliance et un certain nombre proviennent du site Web de l'intim\u00e9.\n(i) Le livre des visiteurs de la Northern Alliance [24] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait vu des documents dans un site Web appel\u00e9 Northern Alliance. Il a t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 ces documents qui, selon lui, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 et les a joints \u00e0 la plainte initiale qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) le 3 septembre 2003. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la Northern Alliance \u00e9tait un groupe dont le si\u00e8ge social se trouvait \u00e0 London (Ontario) et qui affichait un livre des visiteurs sur Internet o\u00f9 les gens pouvaient faire des commentaires en ligne sur divers sujets. Le livre des visiteurs \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 d'une s\u00e9rie de commentaires qui se suivaient les uns apr\u00e8s les autres, sans ordre pr\u00e9cis. Le titre en caract\u00e8res d'affiche qui figurait au haut du livre des visiteurs \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nNorthern Alliance\nLa nouvelle voix de la majorit\u00e9 canadienne\n[25] Deux inscriptions faites par l'intim\u00e9 dans le livre des visiteurs de la Northern Alliance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises dans le cadre de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, \u00e0 sa connaissance, au moment o\u00f9 se d\u00e9roulait l'audience, le livre des visiteurs de la Northern Alliance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9.\n(ii) Le site Web Winnicki [26] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lorsqu'il a examin\u00e9 le livre des visiteurs de la Northern Alliance, il a cliqu\u00e9 sur le lien qui figurait dans les commentaires de l'intim\u00e9 et cela l'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 l'adresse Internet suivante : W3.sympatico.ca\/tom.winnicki. Dans ce site Web, il a d\u00e9couvert de nombreuses images graphiques ainsi que des d\u00e9clarations comme [Traduction] R\u00c9VOLUTION BLANCHE [...] \u00c7A APPROCHE [...] ET C'EST GIGANTESQUE [...] Figuraient \u00e9galement dans ce site Web des liens menant \u00e0 d'autres sites Web dans lesquels on fournissait cens\u00e9ment une histoire objective. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, selon lui, les documents figurant dans le site Web qui se trouvait \u00e0 l'adresse WW3.sympatico.ca\/tom.winnicki avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9. Le plaignant a t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 ces documents le 3 septembre 2003 et les a joints \u00e0 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne dans laquelle il pr\u00e9tendait que la diffusion de ces documents violait le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi.\n[27] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lorsqu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en septembre 2003, il a fait part \u00e0 Bell Sympatico de ses inqui\u00e9tudes concernant le site Web de l'intim\u00e9. Bell Sympatico lui a laiss\u00e9 croire que, au bout du compte, il fermerait le site Web WW3.sympatico.ca\/tom.winnicki.\n(iii) Le Vanguard News Network [28] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a effectu\u00e9 une recherche sur Internet quant au nom Tom Winnicki. Un des r\u00e9sultats qu'il a obtenus lors de cette recherche l'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 un site Web appel\u00e9 Vanguard News Network. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, \u00e0 sa connaissance, le Vanguard News Network (VNN) \u00e9tait un site Web qui \u00e9tait inscrit aux \u00c9tats-Unis et qui \u00e9tait contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par des personnes qui vivaient aux \u00c9tats-Unis. On retrouvait, notamment, dans ce site Web, des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de nouvelles pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es selon un point de vue n\u00e9onazi. Selon le plaignant, figurait \u00e9galement dans ce site Web un groupe de discussion dans lequel les gens pouvaient discuter d'un certain nombre de questions.\n[29] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, d\u00e8s qu'il a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la page principale du VNN, un certain nombre de choix se sont offerts \u00e0 lui. Un de ces choix \u00e9tait le groupe de discussion du VNN. Lorsqu'il a cliqu\u00e9 sur l'ic\u00f4ne du groupe de discussion du VNN, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre page sur le site Web o\u00f9 une autre s\u00e9rie de choix appel\u00e9s fils de discussion \u00e9taient offerts. Selon le plaignant, les fils de discussion sont des sujets de discussion qui sont lanc\u00e9s par des membres du VNN. Les membres du groupe de discussion peuvent afficher (ou diffuser) des messages accessibles au public qui se suivent les uns apr\u00e8s les autres dans le cadre d'un fil ou d'un sujet de discussion donn\u00e9. L'expression Vient tout juste d'arriver introduit un nouveau fil ou nouveau sujet de discussion. Il existe d'autres fils de discussion qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans les cat\u00e9gories figurant dans le groupe de discussion.\n[30] Selon le plaignant, il \u00e9tait relativement simple de devenir membre du groupe de discussion. On n'avait qu'\u00e0 fournir une adresse \u00e9lectronique valide et \u00e0 remplir un formulaire d'inscription.\nC. Troisi\u00e8me question - L'intim\u00e9 a-t-il diffus\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e sur Internet les messages contest\u00e9s provenant des sources susmentionn\u00e9es? (i) Qui a diffus\u00e9 les documents contest\u00e9s? [31] Par l'entremise de son avocat, l'intim\u00e9 a admis avoir diffus\u00e9 les messages figurant dans les plaintes initiales qui ont fait l'objet d'une enqu\u00eate de la part de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et qui ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises au Tribunal. Ces messages comprenaient ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts par le plaignant sur le site Web de la Northern Alliance et sur le site Web Winnicki, ainsi que certains messages provenant du groupe de discussion du VNN.\n[32] Toutefois, on ne savait pas si l'aveu de l'intim\u00e9 qu'il avait diffus\u00e9 les messages contest\u00e9s valait pour les documents post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi. J'ai donc examin\u00e9 ces documents et j'ai conclu, pour les motifs qui suivent, que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait, en fait, la personne qui a diffus\u00e9 les documents post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve durant l'instruction de la pr\u00e9sente cause.\n[33] Dans les messages qui faisaient partie des plaintes initiales, l'intim\u00e9 utilisait parfois le pseudonyme Thexder 3D et parfois le nom Tom Winnicki. Lorsque le pseudonyme \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9, il \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9 de l'image d'un robot.\n[34] La personne qui a diffus\u00e9 les messages post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi mentionne parfois son nom comme \u00e9tant Thexder 3D, parfois comme \u00e9tant Tomasz Winnicki. Dans l'un de ces messages, Tomasz Winnicki a corrig\u00e9 une faute d'orthographe de son pseudonyme en d\u00e9clarant ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nC'est Thexder et non pas Thexter, mais cela n'a pas beaucoup d'importance. \u00c0 partir de maintenant, servez-vous de mon v\u00e9ritable nom, c'est-\u00e0-dire Tomasz Winnicki. En polonais, Tomasz est l'\u00e9quivalant officiel de Tom, alors vous pouvez m'appeler comme \u00e7a.\n[35] Par cons\u00e9quent, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'intim\u00e9, qui se faisait appeler Tom Winnicki et Tomasz Winnicki, et qui utilisait le pseudonyme Thexder 3D accompagn\u00e9 de l'image d'un robot, \u00e9tait la personne qui a diffus\u00e9 les documents post\u00e9rieurs au renvoi.\n(ii) (ii) L'intim\u00e9 a-t-il diffus\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s documents discriminatoires? [36] Dans Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/453, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que l'utilisation de l'expression de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e qui figure au paragraphe 13(1) donne \u00e0 penser que le paragraphe 13(1) vise, non pas les communications priv\u00e9es avec des amis, mais plut\u00f4t une s\u00e9rie de messages qui repr\u00e9sentent un plan public de grande \u00e9chelle pour la diffusion de certaines id\u00e9es ou opinions, con\u00e7ues pour convertir des membres du public (Schnell, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 129).\n[37] La d\u00e9claration de mission du Vanguard News Network, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve durant l'audience, mentionne que le VNN est un groupe d'[Traduction] \u00e9crivains d\u00e9go\u00fbt\u00e9s et m\u00e9contents qui se sont rassembl\u00e9s en vue de [Traduction] reprendre aux Juifs l'esprit am\u00e9ricain. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est manifeste que les messages affich\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 dans ce groupe de discussion faisaient partie d'un plan de grande \u00e9chelle pour la diffusion de certaines opinions, con\u00e7ues pour convertir des membres du public.\n[38] Il y a eu divergence d'opinions entre le plaignant et le t\u00e9moin de l'intim\u00e9, M. Paul Fromm, quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si les messages figurant dans le groupe de discussion du VNN \u00e9taient accessibles au public. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que tous les messages pouvaient \u00eatre consult\u00e9s par les membres du public sans que ceux-ci ne soient membres du groupe de discussion du VNN. M. Fromm, en revanche, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'un certain nombre de messages n'\u00e9taient pas accessibles au public; il fallait \u00eatre membre afin de pouvoir les consulter.\n[39] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Fromm \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9branl\u00e9 lors du contre-interrogatoire. Durant l'audience, \u00e0 l'aide de l'ordinateur de l'agent du greffe du Tribunal, le plaignant a guid\u00e9 M. Fromm dans les \u00e9tapes \u00e0 franchir pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 un certain nombre de messages affich\u00e9s dans un fil de discussion du groupe de discussion du VNN. M. Fromm a avou\u00e9 que, au cours de cet exercice, il a pu acc\u00e9der directement au site Web gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'adresse Internet www.vnnforum.com et il a pu consulter de nombreuses pages du groupe de discussion sans qu'il ait eu besoin de prouver qu'il \u00e9tait membre du groupe de discussion. Compte tenu de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, je conclus que le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant concernant l'acc\u00e8s du public aux messages de l'intim\u00e9 est plus cr\u00e9dible que celui de M. Fromm. J'accepte \u00e9galement le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant que les messages affich\u00e9s dans le groupe de discussion du VNN sont demeur\u00e9s accessibles au public au moins jusqu'au premier jour de l'audience, c'est-\u00e0-dire le 8 ao\u00fbt 2005.\n[40] De m\u00eame, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve susmentionn\u00e9s concernant le livre des visiteurs de la Northern Alliance et le site Web de Winnicki donnent \u00e0 penser que les messages affich\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 sur ces sites Web ne constituaient pas des communications priv\u00e9es avec des amis. Ils \u00e9taient affich\u00e9s pour diffusion \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle et \u00e9taient accessibles au public (jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les sites ferment) gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'utilisation d'un moteur de recherche Internet ou directement en tapant l'adresse Internet sur un ordinateur.\n[41] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que l'intim\u00e9 a affich\u00e9 sur Internet, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, tous les messages contest\u00e9s.\nD. Quatri\u00e8me question - Les documents sont-ils susceptibles d'exposer des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris parce que celles-ci sont identifiables sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite? (i) Le droit [42] Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question susmentionn\u00e9e, le Tribunal s'inspire des d\u00e9finitions des mots haine, m\u00e9pris, exposer et susceptibles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es dans les d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada et la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\n[43] Dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a adopt\u00e9 la d\u00e9finition du Tribunal des mots haine et m\u00e9pris (Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 60; Nealy c. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, p. D\/6469; Taylor et le Western Guard Party c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (1979), D.T. 1\/79 (ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans Taylor). Le mot haine est d\u00e9fini comme aversion active, d\u00e9testation, inimiti\u00e9, malice et malveillance. Cela signifie, en effet, que l'on ne trouve aucune qualit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'objet de sa d\u00e9testation. C'est un mot, toutefois, qui ne comporte pas n\u00e9cessairement le processus mental de regarder de haut une ou des personnes. Il est fort possible de ha\u00efr quelqu'un que l'on estime sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 soi en intelligence, en richesse ou en pouvoir.\n[44] Le mot m\u00e9pris, par contre, est un terme qui sugg\u00e8re le processus mental consistant \u00e0 regarder quelqu'un de haut ou \u00e0 le traiter comme inf\u00e9rieur. Cela refl\u00e8te la d\u00e9finition du dictionnaire des mots d\u00e9daign\u00e9, d\u00e9shonneur ou disgr\u00e2ce (Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 60)\n[45] Le verbe exposer signifie : laisser une personne ou une chose sans protection; laisser sans abri ou d\u00e9fense; soumettre au danger, au ridicule, \u00e0 la censure (la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, p. 29). Dans Taylor, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que le verbe exposer est plus passif que le verbe inciter. Ceci sugg\u00e8re qu'un effort continu ou intentionnel de l'individu qui transmet le message n'est pas envisag\u00e9. De m\u00eame, l'utilisation du verbe exposer au paragraphe 13(1) indique que l'on n'a pas l'intention de susciter une r\u00e9action violente chez la personne qui re\u00e7oit le message. En d'autres termes, selon le Tribunal, si un individu cr\u00e9e les conditions propices \u00e0 la haine, laisse le groupe identifiable expos\u00e9 \u00e0 la rancune ou \u00e0 l'hostilit\u00e9, s'il le place dans une situation o\u00f9 il risque d'\u00eatre ha\u00ef, o\u00f9 la haine ou le m\u00e9pris sont in\u00e9vitables, alors cet individu tombe sous le coup du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi (p. 29).\n[46] Le Tribunal, dans Nealy c. Johnston, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'utilisation du mot susceptible au paragraphe 13(1) signifie qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de produire une preuve qu'un individu ou un groupe particulier a pris les messages au s\u00e9rieux et a en fait dirig\u00e9 sa haine ou son m\u00e9pris contre d'autres personnes. Il n'est pas non plus n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer que quelqu'un est en fait devenu victime de tels actes. \u00c0 l'oppos\u00e9 des autres dispositions de la Loi portant sur la discrimination, le paragraphe 13(1) pr\u00e9voit la responsabilit\u00e9 lorsqu'il existe un effet discriminatoire non prouv\u00e9 ou non prouvable (Nealy c. Johnston, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 45697). Le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il n'existe aucun moyen facile d'acc\u00e8s pour \u00e9valuer le nombre de personnes expos\u00e9es aux messages ainsi que les r\u00e9percussions que ces derniers peuvent avoir eues sur ces personnes. Selon le Tribunal, ces consid\u00e9rations justifient l'extension de la responsabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 13(1) aux cas o\u00f9 il n'y a aucun effet discriminatoire r\u00e9el non prouv\u00e9 ou non prouvable.\n[47] L'intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause a contest\u00e9 l'interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 13(1) faite par le Tribunal dans Nealy c. Johnston, en pr\u00e9tendant que la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour supr\u00eame dans Taylor n'a pas souscrit \u00e0 cette interpr\u00e9tation. L'intim\u00e9 a fond\u00e9 son argument sur les d\u00e9clarations faites par le juge en chef Dickson, au nom de la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour supr\u00eame, dans cette cause. Au paragraphe 60, le juge en chef Dickson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n\u00c0 mon avis, il n'y a aucune incompatibilit\u00e9 entre le fait de donner au paragraphe 13(1) une interpr\u00e9tation qui le rend efficace et la protection de la libert\u00e9 d'expression garantie par l'al. 2b), pourvu que l'interpr\u00e9tation des mots haine et m\u00e9pris repose sur la pleine conscience que l'objectif du Parlement est de prot\u00e9ger l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 et la dignit\u00e9 de tous les individus par la r\u00e9duction des manifestations de l'expression pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[48] L'intim\u00e9 a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 cette d\u00e9claration ainsi que d'autres d\u00e9clarations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par la majorit\u00e9 des juges dans Taylor quant \u00e0 l'importance de mettre l'accent sur les effets de la discrimination, comme signifiant que le paragraphe 13(1) exige la preuve que les documents contest\u00e9s ont caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice.\n[49] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'intim\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la majorit\u00e9 des juges dans Taylor. En outre, elle ne cadre pas avec le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. Selon le paragraphe 13(1), constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait de diffuser des messages qui sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable [...]. La disposition ne mentionne pas que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait de diffuser des messages qui ont pour effet de susciter chez les autres de la haine et du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du groupe cible.\n[50] Comme la majorit\u00e9 des juges l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Taylor, les messages constituant de la propagande haineuse, de par leur nature m\u00eame, causent des pr\u00e9judices de deux mani\u00e8res importantes. Premi\u00e8rement, ils portent atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'estime de soi des membres du groupe cible et, deuxi\u00e8mement, ils minent la tol\u00e9rance et l'ouverture d'esprit qui doivent fleurir dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 multiculturelle vou\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. Cette d\u00e9claration repose sur de nombreuses \u00e9tudes et rapports qui font \u00e9tat du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par les messages haineux (Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 41). Rien ne laisse croire que la conclusion de la majorit\u00e9 des juges quant au pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par les messages haineux ne valait que pour les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[51] Par cons\u00e9quent, les messages qui sont vis\u00e9s par la d\u00e9finition de propagande haineuse qui figure au paragraphe 13(1) causent un pr\u00e9judice. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver l'existence d'un pr\u00e9judice. Le point essentiel est qu'il faut s'assurer que seuls sont vis\u00e9s par le paragraphe 13(1) les messages qui sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres du groupe cible \u00e0 des \u00e9motions exceptionnellement fortes et profondes de d\u00e9testation, se traduisant par des calomnies et de la diffamation.\nLa possibilit\u00e9 d'exposition \u00e0 des pr\u00e9judices\n[52] Comment doit-on \u00e9valuer la possibilit\u00e9 d'exposition \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris? Suffit-il que le Tribunal n'examine que les messages, puis tire une conclusion, en se fondant sur le libell\u00e9, le ton et la pr\u00e9sentation des messages pour d\u00e9cider s'ils sont susceptibles d'exposer des membres du ou des groupes cibles \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris? Ou doit-il exister d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui aident le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si les messages sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres des groupes cibles \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris?\n[53] Dans Citron c. Zundel, (no 4) (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/274, par. 141, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, bien que les t\u00e9moignages des experts furent utiles, c'\u00e9tait le langage utilis\u00e9 dans les documents proprement dits qui a persuad\u00e9 le Tribunal que ceux-ci contrevenaient au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. De m\u00eame, dans Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage des experts donnait \u00e0 penser que les messages \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer les Juifs \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris, mais le Tribunal a conclu qu'il ne faisait aucun doute que les messages eux-m\u00eames \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer les Juifs \u00e0 la haine (Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 43).\n[54] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que la possibilit\u00e9 d'exposition \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris ne devrait pas \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e en fonction des impressions subjectives du Tribunal quant aux documents, ni en fonction de l'\u00e9valuation du Tribunal quant \u00e0 l'incidence possible des messages sur la personne la plus malveillante ou la plus sans coeur comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans Nealy c. Johnston. Au contraire, l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que l'\u00e9valuation devrait \u00eatre faite en tenant compte de la r\u00e9action probable du public canadien.\n[55] La r\u00e9action probable du public canadien \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des messages contest\u00e9s est \u00e9tablie en comparant les messages contest\u00e9s aux messages de m\u00eame nature qui sont transmis sur Internet et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard desquels les r\u00e9actions du public canadien sont connues. L'intim\u00e9 a qualifi\u00e9 ces derniers messages de messages tol\u00e9r\u00e9s. Pour les motifs qui suivent, je ne souscris pas au qualificatif tol\u00e9r\u00e9s, mais par souci de commodit\u00e9, je vais continuer \u00e0 utiliser le qualificatif que l'intim\u00e9 a donn\u00e9 aux messages.\nLes messages tol\u00e9r\u00e9s\n[56] Lors de l'audience, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve compos\u00e9s de passages de la Bible, du Coran, du Marchand de Venise de William Shakespeare, des Aventures de Huckleberry Finn de Mark Twain, de Mein Kampf d'Adolph Hitler, de paroles de musique rap contemporaine disponible sur Internet ainsi que d'autres documents \u00e9crits disponibles en ligne. Ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s comme exemples de documents qui sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les membres d'un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite. Par exemple, dans Le marchand de Venise, Shakespeare d\u00e9crit Shylock, un pr\u00eateur d'argent juif, comme \u00e9tant un chien de Juif. Dans le L\u00e9vitique de la Bible, l'homosexualit\u00e9 est d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant une abomination et les homosexuels sont d\u00e9crits comme \u00e9tant des transgresseurs ignorants qui devraient \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s. La musique rap qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite en preuve d\u00e9crit l'homme blanc comme \u00e9tant le diable et recommande l'ex\u00e9cution des hommes blancs parce qu'ils ne [Traduction] sont pas dignes de vivre avec l'homme noir, le premier homme qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9.\n[57] L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que ces messages \u00e9taient d'une nature comparable \u00e0 celle des messages contest\u00e9s. Elle a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve non contredits d\u00e9montraient que le public canadien n'avait manifest\u00e9 aucune haine ou m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des groupes cibles \u00e0 la suite de ces messages qui, selon l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9, ont sans aucun doute plus d'influence et qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'une diffusion beaucoup plus vaste que les messages contest\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que le public canadien est peu susceptible de manifester de la haine et du m\u00e9pris par suite des messages contest\u00e9s.\n[58] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve non contredits semblent \u00eatre des d\u00e9clarations faites par l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 lors de ses conclusions finales. En voici un exemple :\n[Traduction]\nEn ce qui concerne l'orientation sexuelle, l'opposition v\u00e9h\u00e9mente de la part de l'\u00e9glise catholique \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'homosexualit\u00e9 est actuelle, bien connue, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, existe depuis longtemps et est subventionn\u00e9e par le gouvernement gr\u00e2ce au r\u00e9gime fiscal avantageux dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie l'\u00e9glise. Il est cependant bien connu que l'an dernier, malgr\u00e9 qu'il fut minoritaire, le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire adopter une loi qui l\u00e9galise les mariages entre conjoints de m\u00eame sexe. Le public canadien s'est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 peu susceptible d'\u00eatre inspir\u00e9 par ce message qui pr\u00eache la haine et le m\u00e9pris envers les homosexuels, malgr\u00e9 qu'il fut diffus\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e.\n[59] L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 a de plus fait valoir que le fait que Son excellence la Gouverneure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, Mme Micha\u00eblle Jean, est une femme de race noire et que des mariages multiconfessionnels ont lieu constitue une preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire non contredite que les messages tol\u00e9r\u00e9s n'ont engendr\u00e9 aucune haine ou m\u00e9pris envers les groupes cibles.\n[60] Cette approche comporte un certain nombre de lacunes. Premi\u00e8rement, je ne trouve aucun fondement \u00e0 l'affirmation de l'intim\u00e9 que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve non contredits d\u00e9montrent que le public canadien n'a pas r\u00e9agi avec haine ou m\u00e9pris \u00e0 la suite des messages tol\u00e9r\u00e9s. Par exemple, le fait que la Gouverneure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada soit une femme de race noire, ne prouve en rien que les messages tol\u00e9r\u00e9s qui discr\u00e9ditent les Noirs n'ont pas eu pour cons\u00e9quence que certaines personnes se sont mises \u00e0 ha\u00efr ou \u00e0 m\u00e9priser les Noirs. Le fait qu'il existe des mariages interconfessionnels ne prouve pas que les messages qui encouragent l'annihilation des Juifs n'ont pas eu pour cons\u00e9quence que certaines personnes se sont mises \u00e0 ha\u00efr et \u00e0 m\u00e9priser les Juifs.\n[61] Deuxi\u00e8mement, ce qui est peut-\u00eatre plus important, la question de savoir si oui ou non les Canadiens se sont mis \u00e0 \u00e9prouver de la haine ou du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 la suite de la diffusion desdits messages tol\u00e9r\u00e9s n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec mon \u00e9valuation des messages de l'intim\u00e9. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le plaignant prouve que les messages de l'intim\u00e9, encore moins les autres messages d\u00e9couverts sur Internet, ont eu pour cons\u00e9quence que d'autres personnes se sont mises \u00e0 ha\u00efr ou \u00e0 m\u00e9priser les groupes cibles. Il s'agit de d\u00e9cider si les messages de l'intim\u00e9 sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres des groupes cibles \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n[62] Si l'argument de l'intim\u00e9 est qu'il n'existe aucune preuve que les messages tol\u00e9r\u00e9s ont expos\u00e9 les membres des groupes cibles \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, j'exprime \u00e0 nouveau mon d\u00e9saccord. Le fait que le mariage entre personnes du m\u00eame sexe ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galis\u00e9 dans certains ressorts ne d\u00e9montre pas qu'il est peu probable que les messages tol\u00e9r\u00e9s qui encouragent la violence contre les homosexuels exposent ces derniers \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je fais remarquer que le passage de la Bible qui mentionne qu'un homme qui couche avec un autre homme doit \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9, conjugu\u00e9 avec un symbole homophobe, a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 par la commission d'enqu\u00eate de la Saskatchewan comme exposant les homosexuels \u00e0 la haine (Hellquist c. Owens (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/197, conf. par 2002 SKQB 506, en appel devant la Cour d'appel de la Saskatchewan). Par cons\u00e9quent, on ne peut pr\u00e9tendre qu'il n'existe aucune preuve que les messages tol\u00e9r\u00e9s ont expos\u00e9 des membres du groupe cible \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n[63] Dans notre culture, nous pouvons \u00eatre expos\u00e9s, fr\u00e9quemment, \u00e0 des messages qui v\u00e9hiculent la haine. Toutefois, la possibilit\u00e9 qu'un message exposera des personnes \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris ne s'att\u00e9nue pas parce qu'il y a de nombreux autres messages semblables qui circulent dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. L'objectif qui consiste \u00e0 promouvoir l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires n'est pas favoris\u00e9 par l'importation d'une norme qui pose en fait la question suivante : En comparaison des nombreux messages qui sont v\u00e9hicul\u00e9s dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui sont susceptibles d'exposer des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, ces messages sont-ils \u00e0 ce point mauvais?.\n[64] Pour ces motifs, en d\u00e9cidant si les messages contest\u00e9s sont susceptibles d'exposer des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, je ne peux accorder aucune importance au fait qu'il circule de tr\u00e8s nombreux messages qui auraient pr\u00e9tendument un effet similaire. Au contraire, je dois concentrer mon attention sur la question de savoir s'il est raisonnable de conclure, compte tenu du langage, du ton, de la pr\u00e9sentation et du libell\u00e9 des messages contest\u00e9s, que ceux-ci auraient pu exposer des membres des groupes cibles \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris.\n[65] De plus, comme l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Taylor, tant et aussi longtemps que le Tribunal continue de ne sanctionner que les messages qui sont susceptibles d'exposer des membres des groupes cibles \u00e0 des \u00e9motions exceptionnellement fortes et profondes de haine et de m\u00e9pris, il y a peu de risque que l'opinion subjective du Tribunal entra\u00eene l'interdiction des messages qui ne sont qu'offensants. Le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement garder \u00e0 l'esprit que le but du paragraphe 13(1) est l'interdiction de messages \u00e0 caract\u00e8re haineux qui, par leur nature m\u00eame, cr\u00e9ent un pr\u00e9judice. L'objet du paragraphe 13(1) n'est pas de vider Internet de son contenu vulgaire, d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able et offensant.\n(ii) Les messages contest\u00e9s Le livre des visiteurs de la Northern Alliance\n[66] Dans un message dat\u00e9 du 12 juillet 2003 figurant dans le livre des visiteurs de la Northern Alliance, l'intim\u00e9 fait part de son d\u00e9go\u00fbt pour les Noirs et les Juifs. Il a trait\u00e9 les Noirs de n\u00e8gres et les a d\u00e9crits comme \u00e9tant intellectuellement inf\u00e9rieurs aux Blancs. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'aimait pas les Noirs en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Les motifs qu'il a donn\u00e9s sont que les Noirs sont des personnes violentes et stupides. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les Juifs [Traduction] avaient infest\u00e9 notre monde de Noirs et que, par cons\u00e9quent, on devrait obliger les Juifs \u00e0 vivre avec les Noirs en Isra\u00ebl. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que les Juifs contr\u00f4laient les m\u00e9dias et que c'\u00e9tait pour cette raison que des personnes comme Einstein avaient re\u00e7u beaucoup plus de reconnaissance que les inventeurs qui n'\u00e9taient pas Juifs. L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement fait part de son admiration pour les Japonais et pour leur culture. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les Japonais connaissent tr\u00e8s bien les diff\u00e9rentes races et qu'ils ont des lois tr\u00e8s s\u00e9v\u00e8res en mati\u00e8re d'immigration. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Il sera int\u00e9ressant de voir comment ils traiteront le probl\u00e8me juif.\n[67] Dans ce message, l'intim\u00e9 tente de l\u00e9gitimer une attitude de m\u00e9pris et de haine pour les Noirs en les d\u00e9crivant comme \u00e9tant intellectuellement inf\u00e9rieurs, violents et stupides, bref, comme \u00e9tant des personnes d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de qualit\u00e9s. Il \u00e9labore dans ce message une th\u00e9orie qui critique les Juifs pour avoir amen\u00e9 les Noirs dans la civilisation blanche et qui les accuse de se vanter de cr\u00e9er les nouvelles inventions. Le message encourage la croyance que les Noirs et les Juifs ruinent la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. Il est donc susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris les membres de ces groupes.\nLe site Web Winnicki\n[68] Sur le site Web qui se trouve \u00e0 l'adresse WWW3.sympatico.ca\/tom.winnicki, le plaignant a d\u00e9couvert une image ou un poster graphique sur lequel figuraient des swastikas, un robot et de nombreuses autres images sur lesquelles \u00e9taient inscrits les mots suivants :\n[Traduction]\nLA R\u00c9VOLUTION BLANCHE APPROCHE [...] ET ELLE EST GIGANTESQUE\n[69] Puis, la phrase suivante, \u00e9crite en petits caract\u00e8res, figurait en dessous de l'image de robot :\n[Traduction]\nL' HOLOCANULAR D\u00c9MYSTIFI\u00c9. POUR DE L'HISTOIRE IMPARTIALE, ALLEZ \u00c0 L'ADRESSE SUIVANTE : WWW.ihr.org. SI VOUS VOULEZ DES NOUVELLES POUR LES BLANCS, OUBLIEZ CNN. ALLEZ \u00c0 L'ADRESSE SUIVANTE : WWW.GOVNN.COM\n[70] Au bas du poster, en lettres majuscules et en caract\u00e8re gras, figurait le message suivant :\n[Traduction]\nNOUS ALLONS VOUS AVOIR SALES JUIFS, VOUS ET VOS CHIENS SERVILES.\n[71] Ce message comprend un certain nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui sont susceptibles d'exposer les Juifs \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. Premi\u00e8rement, il qualifie l'Holocauste d'Holocanular. Cette expression inspire le m\u00e9pris et l'inimiti\u00e9 envers les Juifs en donnant \u00e0 penser que l'assassinat collectif de millions de Juifs durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale ne s'est pas produit et n'\u00e9tait qu'un canular. Deuxi\u00e8mement, ce message comprend manifestement des menaces de pr\u00e9judice et de l'inimiti\u00e9 envers les Juifs. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que le message est susceptible d'exposer les Juifs \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\nLe Vanguard News Network\nLes Noirs et les autres peuples qui ne sont pas de race blanche\n[72] Ce qui suit sont des exemples de certains messages affich\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 dans le groupe de discussion du VNN concernant les Noirs et les autres peuples qui ne sont pas de race blanche.\n[73] Dans un message intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Les ghettos de Toronto se d\u00e9placent vers les banlieues figurant dans le groupe de discussion du VNN, l'intim\u00e9 fait des commentaires sur un article paru dans le National Post au d\u00e9but de 2004 concernant l'augmentation de la pauvret\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto. Il cite des parties de l'article qui font \u00e9tat que les quartiers plus pauvres qui \u00e9taient autrefois confin\u00e9s au centre-ville s'\u00e9tendent maintenant aux banlieues comme North York et Scarborough. L'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare ce qui suit entre parenth\u00e8ses :\n[Traduction]\nCe que ces idiots sont en train de nous dire, c'est que North York et Scarborough sont infest\u00e9s de n\u00e8gres paresseux, sauvages et sans aucune valeur ainsi que d'autres d\u00e9chets de race non identifi\u00e9e. Les membres de ma famille ont mis moins d'une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 devenir des membres productifs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. Combien de temps faut-il \u00e0 une peau couleur merde du tiers monde pour devenir un membre productif d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 blanche? Une \u00e9ternit\u00e9, en effet. Sur la CBC communiste on attend parler de ces entrepreneurs asiatiques qui r\u00e9ussissent dans la terre promise - le Canada. \u00c9videmment, la CBC communiste ne tient compte que de quelques arbres et oublie le reste de la for\u00eat. Pour chacun de ces hommes d'affaires \u00e0 la peau couleur merde dont les entreprises sont contamin\u00e9es par l'argent des contribuables blancs, il y des milliers de d\u00e9chets sans valeur.\n[74] Dans un autre message figurant dans le m\u00eame fil de discussion et portant le titre [Toronto] Les ghettos de Toronto se d\u00e9placent vers les banlieues, l'intim\u00e9 fait des commentaires sur un article diff\u00e9rent qui traite de la question des logements abordables. Il cite l'extrait suivant tir\u00e9 de l'article : [Traduction] Comment cela peut-il se produire dans une ville comme celle-ci? soupira Connie Richards, alors qu'elle faisait sa lessive \u00e0 la buanderie Wash & Fold \u00e0 Back Creek, un quartier figurant parmi ceux qui \u00e9taient mentionn\u00e9s dans le rapport. L'intim\u00e9 a affich\u00e9 le message suivant en r\u00e9action \u00e0 cette citation :\n[Traduction]\nComment? COMMENT?! Allez vous faire foutre les n\u00e8gres? D\u00e9sol\u00e9, je ne devrais pas bl\u00e2mer les n\u00e8gres pour ce qu'ils sont. Je voulais plut\u00f4t dire : Allez vous faire foutre les Juifs - destructeurs de pays, vous avez inond\u00e9 notre pays de ces gens. H\u00e9 Connie, prends ton sale linge de n\u00e8gre, mets tes petits n\u00e8gres ill\u00e9gitimes dans ta valise (dix ou autant que tu en as) et fous le camp de notre civilisation blanche. Je suis m\u00eame pr\u00eat \u00e0 te payer un billet de premi\u00e8re classe pour l'Afrique, qu'est-ce que tu en penses?\n[75] On retrouve d'autres commentaires semblables apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9claration.\n[76] Dans un message affich\u00e9 dans le groupe de discussion du VNN en rapport avec un article relatif au meurtre d'une femme et portant le titre [Traduction] H\u00e9, la Polonaise [...] pourquoi ne te trouves-tu pas un copain polonais?, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLes femmes polonaises doivent \u00eatre de sales idiotes. J'ai tellement entendu d'histoires \u00e0 propos de ces putes (pour ne parler que de celles-l\u00e0) qui fr\u00e9quentent des n\u00e8gres et d'autres d\u00e9chets et qui baisent avec eux, c'est vraiment d\u00e9gueulasse. Cette pute qui se m\u00eale avec les autres races a eu ce qu'elle m\u00e9ritait.\n[77] L'intim\u00e9 a lanc\u00e9 un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Une autre fusillade audacieuse \u00e0 Toronto la multiculturelle. Le fil de discussion comprend un certain nombre de liens URL menant \u00e0 de nouvelles histoires. L'intim\u00e9 va d'un lien \u00e0 l'autre et fait des commentaires. Il pr\u00e9sume que c'est une personne de race noire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e dans la fusillade \u00e0 Toronto. Voici ce qu'il dit :\n[Traduction]\nJe parie 1 000 $ que c'est un n\u00e8gre ou quelque chose de semblable de couleur merde [...] eee, c'est-\u00e0-dire un \u00eatre inf\u00e9rieur. Les n\u00e8gres sont-ils vraiment de si mauvais tireurs? Je veux dire, il tirait sur une voiture alors qu'il se trouvait \u00e0 faible distance et, malgr\u00e9 cela, il a atteint deux passants. Con de n\u00e8gre. Comment aimez-vous Toronto la multiculturelle? C'est bon? Et Brad Love, un Canadien qui travaille dur qui a vu sa ville transform\u00e9e en merde en quelques d\u00e9cennies est actuellement en prison parce qu'il a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 des d\u00e9put\u00e9s des lettres tout \u00e0 fait l\u00e9gales (c'est-\u00e0-dire des lettres ne comprenant aucune menace) dans lesquelles il d\u00e9non\u00e7ait l'immigration de gens de couleur. Je veux qu'on me redonne mon pays.\n[78] Puis, il poursuit en d\u00e9clarant ce qui suit : [Traduction] Une peau couleur merde agresse une femme sexuellement (une blanche je pr\u00e9sume). Il mentionne un lien vers une autre histoire figurant dans un site Web appel\u00e9 pulse 24, puis il d\u00e9clare ce qui suit : [Traduction] Les peaux couleur merde transforment n'importe quoi en merde, tout ce qu'ils touchent ou tout ce qu'ils approchent. Il mentionne un autre lien URL et conclut en adressant le message suivant aux Noirs :\n[Traduction]\nMessage \u00e0 vous tous les gens de couleur : Allez-vous en (si vous \u00eates ici), tenez-vous \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart de ma ville et n'y remettez plus les pieds. Ne vous en approchez m\u00eame pas, bande de destructeurs de civilisation. Allez \u00e0 Toronto la multiculturelle [...] mieux encore, retournez en Afrique.\n[79] L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement vis\u00e9 les personnes d'origine indienne en d\u00e9clarant ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLES N\u00c8GRES ET LES INDIENS SONT DES MERDEUX!!!! FOUTEZ LE CAMP DE NOTRE CIVILISATION, BANDE DE D\u00c9CHETS!!!!\"\n[80] Dans les messages susmentionn\u00e9s, l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9crit les Noirs et les autres personnes qui n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 la race blanche, particuli\u00e8rement les immigrants, comme \u00e9tant des criminels dot\u00e9s de quotients intellectuels inf\u00e9rieurs. Il parle \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de ces gens comme \u00e9tant des excr\u00e9ments humains et des d\u00e9chets. Il d\u00e9crit les Noirs comme \u00e9tant pire que des [Traduction] b\u00e2tards menteurs, violents et voleurs. L'intim\u00e9 traite les Noirs des noms suivants : n\u00e8gres, n\u00e8gres inf\u00e9rieurs, sales inf\u00e9rieurs, sales d\u00e9chets, sales coquerelles, alias sales n\u00e8gres. Ces expressions et ces qualificatifs sont d\u00e9shumanisants, d\u00e9gradants et sont tr\u00e8s susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris les Noirs ainsi que les autres personnes qui n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 la race blanche.\n[81] Le message qui ressort clairement de l'ensemble des messages de l'intim\u00e9 concernant les Noirs, les Indiens et les autres personnes qui n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 la race blanche est que ceux-ci sont \u00e0 ce point d\u00e9testables, violents et stupides qu'ils doivent \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9s du Canada ou s\u00e9par\u00e9s de la population blanche. Ils n'ont aucune qualit\u00e9 et sont tellement dangereux qu'il est justifi\u00e9 de les ha\u00efr intens\u00e9ment.\n[82] J'estime que l'intim\u00e9 ne fait pas seulement qu'exprimer bruyamment ses \u00e9motions; il supplie les visiteurs du site Web de penser comme lui. Il tente de convertir les gens \u00e0 ses opinions. Cela est attest\u00e9 par le fait qu'il a \u00e9crit les mots suivants sur tous les messages qu'il a affich\u00e9s : [Traduction] JOIGNEZ-VOUS \u00c0 NOUS, JE VOIS DE LA PASSION DANS VOS YEUX. L'utilisation par l'intim\u00e9 d'articles de journaux comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tayant ses d\u00e9clarations donne un certain air de l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 ainsi qu'un air de commentaire social \u00e0 ses messages. Selon moi, il est possible que certaines personnes seront convaincues par ces messages. J'estime que le fonds et la forme des messages concernant les Noirs et les autres peuples qui ne sont pas de race blanche cr\u00e9aient une possibilit\u00e9 que des membres de ces groupes soient expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris.\n[83] Un des messages les plus troublants que l'intim\u00e9 a affich\u00e9s figure dans le fil de discussion du Vanguard News Network intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] La manifestation du 15 mai \u00e0 Topeka - Serez-vous pr\u00e9sents?. Selon le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant, les participants \u00e0 ce groupe de discussion discutaient d'une contre-manifestation qui allait avoir lieu aux \u00c9tats-Unis en vue d'exprimer leur d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration de l'anniversaire de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame des Etats-Unis dans Brown c. Topeka Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). Cette d\u00e9cision a men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'abolition de la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation raciale dans les \u00e9coles am\u00e9ricaines.\n[84] Dans le message qu'il a affich\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de son pseudonyme Thexder 3D, l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comment on lui a refus\u00e9 l'entr\u00e9e aux \u00c9tats-Unis alors qu'il voulait se rendre \u00e0 la contre-manifestation de Topeka. \u00c0 la fin de sa description, l'intim\u00e9 adresse un plaidoyer passionn\u00e9 au groupe de discussion des lecteurs afin que ceux-ci impriment son signe, lequel est joint \u00e0 son message et [Traduction] le tiennent bien haut pour que le monde puisse le voir au rassemblement. Il d\u00e9clare ce qui suit : [Traduction] J'aimerais bien voir les t\u00eates que feront ces n\u00e8gres et ces d\u00e9chets lorsqu'ils verront mon signe \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision.\n[85] Le signe joint au message affich\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 est compos\u00e9 de deux pages. La premi\u00e8re page consiste en un montage de quatre photos sur lesquelles du texte a \u00e9t\u00e9 imprim\u00e9, et la deuxi\u00e8me page consiste en du texte. Trois des quatre photos figurant sur la premi\u00e8re page montre sous diff\u00e9rents angles le cadavre d'un Noir. Dans chacune des trois photos, il semble que la cervelle de l'homme d\u00e9borde de son cr\u00e2ne d\u00e9fonc\u00e9. Les parties internes du cou de l'homme sont \u00e9galement visibles \u00e0 travers une coupure dans la r\u00e9gion du cou. La quatri\u00e8me photo montre un Noir vivant qui est en train de sourire et qui soutient la t\u00eate de ce qui semble \u00eatre un Noir mort ou inconscient (peut-\u00eatre le m\u00eame homme qui figure sur les trois autres photos).\n[86] Les mots suivants sont inscrits sur la photo du Noir vivant qui soutient la t\u00eate du Noir mort ou inconscient (du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'image) : [Traduction] Nous sommes fiers de c\u00e9l\u00e9bwer la culture afwicaine, \u00e0 www.govnn.com. Puis, dans le coin inf\u00e9rieur gauche, on peut lire les mots Monrovia (Lib\u00e9ria). Autour du p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre du montage des quatre photos, on peut lire ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLES JUIFS ONT PRODUIT LE ZIMBABWE, VOULEZ-VOUS L'AFRIQUE ICI?

Dans un message qu'il a affich\u00e9 dans un fil de discussion et qui portait le titre [Traduction] Couper des mains, lapider, tirer des enfants en bas d'un passage sup\u00e9rieur surplombant une autoroute achaland\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9 pose la question suivante \u00e0 ces lecteurs : [Traduction] Qu'est-ce qui s'en vient Toronto? Ceci?. Il a ensuite affich\u00e9 une photo d'un groupe de Noirs parmi lesquels certaines personnes tiennent les jambes d'un homme ou d'un gar\u00e7on noir manifestement mort et dont le corps semble calcin\u00e9. Les mots suivants sont inscrits au-dessus de la photo : [Traduction] En Afrique, cette bande de lynchage a fait br\u00fbler cette personne et a tra\u00een\u00e9 son corps dans les rues, et ce, apr\u00e8s l'avoir battue de fa\u00e7on insens\u00e9e. Cette image horrifiante ainsi que l'invitation \u00e0 se demander si cela pourrait arriver \u00e0 Toronto sont suivies par le logotype de l'intim\u00e9 : SUIVEZ-NOUS, JE VOIS DE LA PASSION DANS VOS YEUX.\n[90] Plus que les mots, les images captent de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9sistible l'attention des gens. Les photos transmettent et d\u00e9forment un sens d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s puissante. Bien qu'il ne fasse aucun doute que certaines personnes trouveront tellement d\u00e9go\u00fbtantes les images figurant dans les documents de l'intim\u00e9 qu'elles s'en d\u00e9tourneront imm\u00e9diatement, d'autres personnes agiront comme des automobilistes qui ralentissent sur l'autoroute pour voir s'il n'y a pas une personne qui saigne abondamment suite \u00e0 un accident routier. Les messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits sur les photos ont un effet plus puissant, selon moi, lorsqu'ils sont conjugu\u00e9s avec les fortes impressions que l'on ressent naturellement lorsque l'on voit des corps br\u00fbl\u00e9s et \u00e9ventr\u00e9s. Ils donnent l'impression que, dans la culture africaine, commettre des atrocit\u00e9s contre d'autres \u00eatres humains est un comportement normal et que de tels \u00e9v\u00e9nements pourraient se produire au Canada. Le message est clair : les Noirs constituent une menace dangereuse, meurtri\u00e8re et ils ne m\u00e9ritent rien de plus que le plus grand d\u00e9go\u00fbt et le plus grand m\u00e9pris. En outre, j'estime que l'utilisation de l'imagerie photographique conjugu\u00e9e avec des mots incendiaires inscrits sur les images ajoute encore plus de virulence \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris auquel les Noirs pourraient \u00eatre expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la suite des messages.\n[91] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que les messages portant sur les Noirs et les autres peuples qui ne sont pas de race blanche ainsi que sur les personnes d'origine africaine qui figuraient dans le groupe de discussion du VNN et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve au cours de l'audience sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres de ces groupes \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris.\nLes Juifs\n[92] L'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9crit les Juifs d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s vulgaire et tr\u00e8s hostile. Son th\u00e8me fondamental est que les Juifs sont des gens d\u00e9go\u00fbtants et m\u00e9chants qui sont r\u00e9solus \u00e0 d\u00e9truire la civilisation blanche europ\u00e9enne. Ses messages exhortent les Canadiens de race blanche \u00e0 adopter sa croyance que les Juifs contr\u00f4lent les m\u00e9dias et le gouvernement et qu'ils ont invent\u00e9 ou exag\u00e9r\u00e9 l'Holocauste afin d'extorquer des sommes d'argent aux gouvernements et aux institutions partout dans le monde. Par exemple, dans un message qu'il a affich\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 conteste une d\u00e9claration faite par un membre d'un organisme national juif concernant l'article 319 du Code criminel, lequel porte sur les crimes haineux. Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les Juifs appartiennent \u00e0 une race \u00e9trang\u00e8re d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de toute valeur, l'intim\u00e9 pose une s\u00e9rie de questions qui visent manifestement \u00e0 obtenir la r\u00e9ponse que les Juifs tentent de manipuler les lois canadiennes. L'intim\u00e9 pose la question suivante :\n[Traduction]\nQu'en pensez-vous Canadiens de race blanche? Les Juifs devraient-ils avoir le droit de s'exprimer ou d'avoir une quelconque influence, directe ou indirecte, quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration des lois dans notre pays? Avez-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu l'expression tol\u00e9rance z\u00e9ro? Savez-vous qui l'a utilis\u00e9e? Savez-vous pourquoi? Savez-vous que, \u00e0 un moment ou \u00e0 un autre, les Juifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9s, en grand nombre, de la plupart des pays europ\u00e9ens? Dans certains cas, plus d'une fois. Pourquoi croyez-vous que cela est arriv\u00e9? Croyez-vous que nous devrions adopter des lois pour accorder plus de libert\u00e9 aux citoyens ou pour diminuer leur libert\u00e9? Que tentent de faire les Juifs? Pourquoi, pourquoi, pourquoi, nom d'un chien [...] pourquoi?\nPendant que je le peux encore [...]\nALLEZ VOUS FAIRE FOUTRE LES JUIFS!\nSALES HEEBES ([Traduction] youpins)\nSALES KIKES (youpins)\nSALES YIDS (youpins)\nSALES ZHIDS (youpins)\nSALES SHEENIES (youpins)\nSALES JUIFS!!! (n'y-a-t-il pas de meilleur mot pour d\u00e9crire les Juifs?)\n[Nom d'un chien! Je veux des lettres encore plus grosses! \u2639]\n[93] Selon moi, la raison pour laquelle le message susmentionn\u00e9 est susceptible d'exposer les Juifs \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris ne r\u00e9side pas uniquement dans le langage offensant utilis\u00e9 envers les Juifs, mais \u00e9galement parce qu'il est tr\u00e8s susceptible de r\u00e9pandre l'id\u00e9e que les Juifs cr\u00e9ent des lois comme l'article 319 du Code criminel dans le but de d\u00e9truire le monde des Canadiens de race blanche. Il cr\u00e9e l'impression que les Juifs constituent une dangereuse menace pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[94] Dans un autre message qu'il a affich\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 fait part de son opinion que l'Holocauste est un canular visant \u00e0 extorquer des billions de dollars \u00e0 des pays comme l'Allemagne. Il d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nEt qu'est-ce que c'est que toute cette merde que j'ai entendue concernant les abat-jour et le savon dans mon cours d'histoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole secondaire? Je cherche toujours des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s sur la mani\u00e8re qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e pour transformer un Juif en pain ou en savon. Ils \u00e9taient et sont toujours des gens tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9atifs, donc, s'il avait exist\u00e9 une mani\u00e8re, je suis certain qu'ils l'auraient trouv\u00e9e. S'ils ont vraiment transform\u00e9 des cadavres de Juifs en savon, j'aimerais qu'on me montre comment ils ont fait.\n[95] La banalisation et le d\u00e9ni de l'existence de l'Holocauste sont susceptibles de provoquer de nombreuses r\u00e9actions chez les gens. Pour ceux qui ont v\u00e9cu l'Holocauste, ils peuvent g\u00e9n\u00e9rer chez eux un sentiment de rage et de d\u00e9sespoir provoqu\u00e9 par le fait qu'on nie l'existence d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements qu'ils ont v\u00e9cus. Chez d'autres, l'all\u00e9gation que l'Holocauste est un canular peut tr\u00e8s bien g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un \u00e9tat de col\u00e8re extr\u00eame car ils auront le sentiment que le monde a \u00e9t\u00e9 roul\u00e9 et vol\u00e9 par les Juifs. Cette situation m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la col\u00e8re et \u00e0 un profond ressentiment envers les Juifs.\n[96] L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement utilis\u00e9 des photos pour v\u00e9hiculer son sentiment de haine envers les Juifs. Par exemple, dans le message qu'il a diffus\u00e9 dans le site Web du VNN, il a affich\u00e9 la photo de quatre filles sur laquelle \u00e9taient inscrits en grosses lettres les mots qui suivent :\n[Traduction]\nLes Juifs d\u00e9testent la beaut\u00e9 et la noblesse europ\u00e9enne. Toutes ces filles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 brutalement assassin\u00e9es par de sauvages Juifs communistes. Nous allons vous avoir, b\u00e2tards de Juifs et vous vivrez l'enfer.\nASSASSIN\u00c9ES PAR LES JUIFS.\n[97] Le contraste entre l'innocence et la beaut\u00e9 de la photo des quatre filles et l'all\u00e9gation de meurtre est tr\u00e8s puissant. Peu de choses provoquent autant de haine que des all\u00e9gations de meurtre sauvage d'enfants innocents. Il s'agit essentiellement d'un poster qui encourage la vengeance envers les Juifs.\n[98] En effets, dans l'un des messages qu'il a affich\u00e9s, l'intim\u00e9 fait part de sa col\u00e8re en rapport avec une d\u00e9claration selon laquelle les travailleurs \u00e9trangers volent des emplois aux Am\u00e9ricains. Il d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\n\u00c0 quand le bain de sang? Je suis relativement ais\u00e9, j'occupe un emploi stable \u00e0 temps plein, j'ai peu de d\u00e9penses, je paie toutes mes factures en temps sans grandes difficult\u00e9s, toutefois, je m'en fais pour tous ces Am\u00e9ricains, Canadiens et Europ\u00e9ens de race blanche qui perdent leur vie sur l'ordre du GOZ. \u00c7a ne me d\u00e9rangerait pas que la guerre sainte raciale commence d\u00e8s demain.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[99] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, au sein du mouvement n\u00e9onazi, l'expression guerre sainte raciale (sous forme abr\u00e9g\u00e9e Rahowa (Racial Holy War)), telle qu'elle est utilis\u00e9e, renvoie \u00e0 une guerre raciale apocalyptique. On croit que, \u00e0 un certain moment dans l'avenir, tous les Blancs seront oblig\u00e9s d'\u00e9liminer toutes les autres races afin de pr\u00e9server ce qui est per\u00e7u comme \u00e9tant leur supr\u00e9matie. GOZ est l'acronyme de gouvernement de l'Ordre sioniste, lequel renvoie \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie que les Juifs contr\u00f4lent les gouvernements de tous les pays du monde.\n[100] Dans le message susmentionn\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 tient manifestement les Juifs responsables du ch\u00f4mage et donne \u00e0 penser que le massacre de toutes les personnes qui ne sont pas de race blanche constituerait la solution qui s'impose. La conclusion que les Juifs sont responsables du ch\u00f4mage et de la pauvret\u00e9, selon moi, est susceptible d'exposer ceux-ci \u00e0 une malice extr\u00eame qui pourrait se traduire par des actes de violence.\nConclusion : les messages constituent de la propagande haineuse\n[101] Je conclus que les messages affich\u00e9s dans le livre des visiteurs de la Northern Alliance, dans le site Web Winnicki, dans le groupe de discussion du site Web VNN sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris les Juifs, les Noirs, les autres personnes qui ne sont pas de race blanche et les personnes d'origine africaine. Je fonde cette affirmation sur les conclusions suivantes : les messages d\u00e9crivent les membres du groupe cible comme \u00e9tant des d\u00e9chets inf\u00e9rieurs qui ne m\u00e9ritent rien de plus que le plus grand d\u00e9go\u00fbt et le plus grand m\u00e9pris; ils v\u00e9hiculent l'id\u00e9e que les membres des groupes cibles sont dangereux, m\u00e9chants et constituent une menace pour les Canadiens de race blanche; ils expriment une haine virulente envers les membres des groupes cibles en des termes violents et mena\u00e7ants; ils exhortent les autres \u00e0 adopter la m\u00eame position que l'intim\u00e9; ils tentent de justifier, de persuader et de l\u00e9gitimer les actes de violence commis contre des membres des groupes cibles. Il en r\u00e9sulte que les groupes cibles peuvent tr\u00e8s facilement \u00eatre victime de haine, de m\u00e9pris, voir m\u00eame de violence, \u00e0 la suite de la diffusion de ces messages.\n[102] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que les messages n'\u00e9taient pas susceptibles d'exposer les membres des groupes cibles \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris car quiconque navigue sur Internet serait pr\u00e9venu de la teneur des messages par la nature des banni\u00e8res figurant sur les cadres du VNN. Les banni\u00e8res du VNN annoncent le message qui suit : [Traduction] R\u00e9volution blanche dossiers Panzerfaust et parfois : [Traduction] Radio White fait pr\u00e9sentement jouer Semeur de haine - La bataille n'est pas encore termin\u00e9e, le Semeur de haine est encore l\u00e0. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon l'intim\u00e9, les gens ont le choix de lire ou de ne pas lire les messages.\n[103] Dans Taylor, le m\u00eame choix s'offrait aux personnes qui appelaient au service de messages t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques afin de recevoir les messages qui, selon ce qu'on a jug\u00e9 dans cet arr\u00eat, violaient le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. Le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 qu'il importait peu que les gens acc\u00e8dent aux messages de leur plein gr\u00e9, tout en sachant \u00e0 quoi s'attendre. Cela n'avait aucune incidence sur le fait que les messages \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer les membres des groupes cibles \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. De m\u00eame, je conclus que le fait que les banni\u00e8res constituaient une certaine forme d'avertissement quant au contenu du site Web ne soustrait pas les messages \u00e0 la port\u00e9e du paragraphe 13(1). Que des personnes d\u00e9couvrent involontairement les messages ou que d'autres personnes les aient recherch\u00e9s activement, il y a, selon moi, une forte possibilit\u00e9 que les messages exposent les membres des groupes cibles \u00e0 une haine virulente et au m\u00e9pris.\n[104] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que, en diffusant de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, par Internet, les messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve dans l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l'intim\u00e9 a viol\u00e9 le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi.\nLes messages dans lesquels il est express\u00e9ment fait mention du plaignant\n[105] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve huit messages dans lesquels il est express\u00e9ment fait mention du plaignant. Dans ces messages, le plaignant est d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un Juif, un pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 Juif, un inf\u00e2me Juif acide et on laisse entendre qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne parce que, comme tous les Juifs, il veut obtenir des sommes d'argent. On a pr\u00e9tendu que, dans le contexte des autres messages de l'intim\u00e9 qui \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer les Juifs \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, la mention expresse du plaignant comme Juif exposait ce dernier \u00e0 cette m\u00eame haine ou \u00e0 ce m\u00eame m\u00e9pris.\n[106] Les messages dans lesquels il est express\u00e9ment fait mention du plaignant sont ainsi libell\u00e9s :\n(1) Le premier message a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 dans un fil de discussion ou sujet de discussion du groupe de discussion du VNN et \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] La r\u00e9surgence haineuse de l'antis\u00e9mitisme. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que ce fil de discussion a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 le 17 janvier 2004. L'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit dans ce message :\n[Traduction]\n[...] Les Juifs deviennent \u00e0 chaque jour de plus en plus cingl\u00e9s \u00e0 tenter de voir comment on pourrait censurer Internet. Moi-m\u00eame, j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de cette tentative lorsque Bell Sympatico a c\u00e9d\u00e9 aux pressions des Juifs, gr\u00e2ce au Juif Richard Warman qui travaille pour la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (laquelle assassine les hommes blancs). Les salauds n'ont pas que supprim\u00e9 la page offensante (m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que j'eus modifi\u00e9 le mot interdit Juifs pour le mot Sionistes), ils ont \u00e9galement supprim\u00e9 toute ma programmation ainsi que tout mon art 3D. Tant et aussi longtemps que les mensonges des Juifs continuent de circuler, les Juifs continueront de r\u00e9colter des milliards et des milliards de dollars en indemnit\u00e9s, il est donc tr\u00e8s important pour les Juifs de censurer notre Internet, des sites comme Zundelsite, VNN, ainsi que d'autres sites, mais h\u00e9las [...] TROP TARD SALES JUIFS STUPIDES, VOUS (ADL, SPLC JDL, CJC et autres) AVEZ \u00c9CHOU\u00c9!

Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 parier que ceux-ci avaient notamment comme objectif la d\u00e9nonciation des Juifs.\n(2) Dans un autre message, lequel fut diffus\u00e9 le 13 mars 2004 dans un fil de discussion du groupe de discussion du VNN et \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Les Am\u00e9ricains ne sont pas humains, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nJ'ai moi-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 rep\u00e9r\u00e9 par le radar juif lorsqu'un ignoble Juif acide, Richard Warman (celui-ci affirme ne pas \u00eatre Juif), a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre moi \u00e0 la CCDP (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (ou plut\u00f4t la Commission d'assassinat des hommes blancs)). C'\u00e9tait surtout en raison de certaines remarques que j'ai faites dans le livre des invit\u00e9s de la Northern Alliance, laquelle n'existe plus, ainsi qu'en raison d'une photo des filles du Tsar (ainsi que d'autres) que j'ai fait circuler dans le Net.

Dans ce message, l'intim\u00e9 renvoie \u00e0 un article qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par Randy Richmond et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 dans le London Free Press le 18 ao\u00fbt 2004. L'article du London Free Press faisait mention du fait que la police avait entrepris une enqu\u00eate criminelle sur les activit\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9. L'article faisait mention de d\u00e9clarations provenant d'un certain nombre de sources, notamment du plaignant, dans lesquels celles-ci faisaient part de leurs opinions concernant les messages contest\u00e9s.\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cet article de journal, l'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nPourquoi suis-je menac\u00e9 par la police, par quatre organismes europ\u00e9ens anti-Blancs (lesquels sont ironiquement financ\u00e9s par des Europ\u00e9ens blancs) et peut-\u00eatre par un avocat juif pour avoir fait cela? Pourquoi la police ne fait-elle pas plut\u00f4t son travail qui consiste \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne blanche et \u00e0 renvoyer les n\u00e8gres dans leur habitat naturel [...] l'Afrique?\n\u00c0 nouveau, le 24 ao\u00fbt 2004, l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLe nom Warman \u00e9quivaut-t-il au mot Juif?

Cette cause portait sur des all\u00e9gations de violation du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi en raison de propagande haineuse. Dans cette cause, comme en l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant demandait \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 personnellement cibl\u00e9. Le fil de discussion \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] La fonction JOG s'en prend aux h\u00f4tes Web. L'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare ce qui suit dans ce message :\n[Traduction]\nAvez-vous vu, ces sales vauriens d'avocats demandent 80 000 $ en [...] indemnit\u00e9s.ALLEZ, PAYEZ!!!

C'est ce qu'il fait aux gens. Le salaud navigue sur Internet et recherche les sites qui sont tant soi peut pro-Europ\u00e9ens blancs et s'il trouve quelque chose d'un peu offensant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de nos minorit\u00e9s privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es au Canada, il d\u00e9pose une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, laquelle d\u00e9teste les Blancs). Lorsque la cause est port\u00e9e devant un tribunal, il esp\u00e8re que l'accus\u00e9 abandonnera. Apr\u00e8s cela, il l'emm\u00e8ne devant la Cour des petites cr\u00e9ances et le poursuit pour un montant de 9999,99 $, juste en de\u00e7a du montant limite de 10 000 $ de telle sorte que la cause rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour des petites cr\u00e9ances (la limite est peut-\u00eatre de 5 000 $, auquel cas il le poursuit pour un montant de 4 999,99 $). Lorsqu'il gagne, il obtient l'argent et voil\u00e0 comment, selon moi, il gagne sa vie. Il obtient probablement une grande aide financi\u00e8re de la part de ses copains JUIFS du CJC (Congr\u00e8s juif canadien), lequel obtient gratuitement des millions de dollars gr\u00e2ce au GOZ canadien, financ\u00e9 par les contribuables canadiens de race blanche.

L'intim\u00e9 a affich\u00e9 de nouveau, sous le titre, des documents \u00e9manant d'une tierce partie qui qualifiait le plaignant de [Traduction] militant professionnel contre la libert\u00e9 de parole et de [Traduction] censeur.\n(7) Le 29 octobre 2004, l'intim\u00e9 a lanc\u00e9 un fil de discussion portant le titre suivant : [Traduction] Richard Warman recommence. VA TE FAIRE FOUTRE POLICIER DE LA PENS\u00c9E.\n(8) En mai 2005, l'intim\u00e9 a diffus\u00e9 un certain nombre de messages dans un fil de discussion qui portait le titre [Traduction] Les Juifs et les anti-Europ\u00e9ens blancs lancent une nouvelle attaque contre un combattant pour la libert\u00e9 de race blanche. La majorit\u00e9 des messages de l'intim\u00e9 figurant dans ce fil de discussion avaient trait \u00e0 une lettre ouverte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9e publiquement par un certain nombre de groupes et par un certain nombre de personnes, notamment le plaignant, et dans laquelle on demandait \u00e0 la police et au gouvernement de prendre des mesures contre l'intim\u00e9. Dans l'un des messages figurant dans ce fil de discussion, l'intim\u00e9 fournit une liste de ce qu'il all\u00e8gue \u00eatre des plaintes r\u00e9centes en mati\u00e8re de droit de la personne contre ce qu'il appelle [Traduction] des activistes nationalistes et des pro-Blancs du Canada. La plainte contre l'intim\u00e9 qui a donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance figurait au premier rang sur cette liste.\n[107] Dans un autre message figurant dans le fil de discussion susmentionn\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9crit le titre suivant en grosses lettres majuscules et en caract\u00e8re gras : [Traduction] MES ENNEMIS. \u00c0 la suite de ce titre, l'intim\u00e9 a affich\u00e9 les photos de trois personnes dont l'une \u00e9tait le plaignant. Sur le front de chacune de ces trois personnes figurait une \u00e9toile de David. Puis l'une des inscriptions suivantes figurait au bas des photos : [Traduction] Fort probablement un Juif, Possiblement un Juif et Juif honoraire. Le plaignant \u00e9tait d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant Possiblement un Juif.\n[108] Dans tous les messages susmentionn\u00e9s, sauf un, le plaignant est qualifi\u00e9 de m\u00e9chant Juif acide, d'homme soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 d'\u00eatre Juif, de M. Vermine ou tout simplement de Juif et il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que, comme tous les autres Juifs (selon l'intim\u00e9) le plaignant extorque de l'argent aux Canadiens de race blanche et suppriment la libert\u00e9 d'expression.\n[109] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, en fait, il n'est pas Juif. Toutefois, je partage l'opinion des autres membres du Tribunal qu'il importe peu que M. Warman soit Juif ou non. Une personne qui est per\u00e7ue comme ayant les caract\u00e9ristiques d'une personne vis\u00e9e par l'un des motifs de distinction illicite peut \u00eatre victime de discrimination, m\u00eame si elle n'a pas vraiment ces caract\u00e9ristiques (School District no 44 (North Vancouver) c. Jubran, 2005 BCCA 201, paragraphe 41, autorisation de pourvoi devant la C.S.C. refus\u00e9; voir \u00e9galement Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (ville), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665). Dans ce contexte, le plaignant, selon moi, appartenait \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite.\n[110] Le ton des messages est tr\u00e8s hostile et tr\u00e8s mena\u00e7ant. Les messages v\u00e9hiculent la nette impression que le plaignant, en tant que Juif pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, est un \u00eatre m\u00e9prisable qui ne m\u00e9rite rien de plus que le plus grand m\u00e9pris. L'all\u00e9gation que les activit\u00e9s du plaignant s'inscrivent dans le contexte d'un complot juif international visant \u00e0 extorquer de l'argent aux non-Juifs est susceptible, selon moi, d'exposer le plaignant, ainsi que les Juifs, \u00e0 de profonds sentiments de col\u00e8re, de ressentiment et de haine.\n[111] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que les messages dans lesquels il est express\u00e9ment fait mention du plaignant violent le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi.\nE. La cinqui\u00e8me question - L'intim\u00e9 a-t-il exerc\u00e9 ou menac\u00e9 d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant? [112] Selon l'article 14.1 de la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait d'exercer ou de menacer d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e d'un acte discriminatoire ou contre la personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Cette disposition de la Loi est importante parce que, sans elle, de nombreuses personnes h\u00e9siteraient \u00e0 se plaindre de discrimination par crainte de repr\u00e9sailles. Elle garantit aux plaignants ainsi qu'aux victimes pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es de discrimination que, si on exerce des repr\u00e9sailles contre eux ou s'ils font l'objet de menaces parce qu'ils ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, la situation sera corrig\u00e9e. L'article 14.1 peut \u00e9galement avoir pour effet de dissuader les personnes qui exerceraient ou menaceraient d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre une personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, et ce, afin de la punir ou de l'obliger \u00e0 retirer sa plainte.\n[113] Quel genre de conduite constitue des repr\u00e9sailles ou des menaces de repr\u00e9sailles au sens de l'article 14.1? Voici un certain nombre d'exemples de conduites qui, selon le Tribunal, violent l'article 14.1 :\n[114] envoyer une lettre \u00e0 l'employeur du plaignant en vue de le faire cong\u00e9dier (Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 73);\n- adresser des menaces de mort au plaignant (Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 74);\n- menacer de ruiner la carri\u00e8re ainsi que la vie du plaignant (Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 75);\n- refuser de renouveler un contrat de travail (dans Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel) [2001] D.C.D.P. no 1, par. 233, le Tribunal a conclu que cet acte constituait une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles mais a conclu que l'acte avait eu lieu avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur des dispositions relatives aux repr\u00e9sailles);\n- publier des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes sur le plaignant (Bressette c. Conseil de Bande de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Kettle et Stony Point 2004 TCDP 40, par. 58)\n- annuler la nomination du plaignant comme d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 une assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale annuelle (Bressette c. Conseil de Bande de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Kettle et Stony Point 2004 TCDP 40, par. 60)\n[115] Est-il n\u00e9cessaire de prouver que l'intim\u00e9 tentait de faire du tort au plaignant ou \u00e0 la victime afin de prouver qu'il y a eu repr\u00e9sailles? Un certain nombre de membres du Tribunal estiment que, dans les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de repr\u00e9sailles, on doit prouver l'intention (voir, par exemple : Roger Virk c. Bell Canada (Ontario) 2005 TCDP 2, par. 156). D'autres membres ont conclu que, si un plaignant a per\u00e7u raisonnablement que la conduite reproch\u00e9e de l'intim\u00e9 constituait des repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, cela pourrait \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles ind\u00e9pendamment de toute intention prouv\u00e9e de l'intim\u00e9 (voir, par exemple : Wong c. Banque Royale du Canada [2001] D.C.D.P. no 11 (Q.L.), par. 222; Bressette c. Conseil de Bande de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Kettle et Stony Point, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 49). Toutefois, il faut d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure la perception du plaignant est raisonnable. Les intim\u00e9s ne devraient pas \u00eatre tenus responsables de l'angoisse ou des r\u00e9actions exag\u00e9r\u00e9es des plaignants.\n[116] Je suis enclin \u00e0 souscrire au raisonnement suivi dans Wong et Bressette. Selon moi, ce raisonnement est conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration faite par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, selon laquelle la Loi est de nature r\u00e9paratrice et non pas de nature punitive et que, par cons\u00e9quent, les motifs ou les intentions des auteurs d'actes discriminatoires ne constituent pas une des pr\u00e9occupations majeures du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[117] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que les m\u00eames huit messages dans lesquels l'intim\u00e9 a express\u00e9ment fait mention du plaignant et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s contraires au paragraphe 13(1), sont \u00e9galement contraires \u00e0 l'article 14.1 de la Loi. Bien qu'il soit possible que la m\u00eame conduite sera jug\u00e9e contraire \u00e0 plus d'une disposition de la Loi, la question qui se pose alors est de savoir si, dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, il est raisonnable d'accorder une double indemnisation pour la m\u00eame conduite. Je traiterai de cette question plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 la section intitul\u00e9e Les redressements.\n[118] \u00c0 la pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tape de l'analyse, il faut d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant a per\u00e7u raisonnablement que les messages contest\u00e9s constituaient des repr\u00e9sailles ou des menaces de repr\u00e9sailles parce qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre l'intim\u00e9.\n[119] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, les messages d\u00e9crivaient le plaignant en termes tr\u00e8s injurieux. Dans tous les messages affich\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9s, sauf un, le plaignant est d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un Juif, un inf\u00e2me Juif acide ou un pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 Juif. Je conclus que les messages \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s mena\u00e7ants. Le dernier message dans lequel une \u00e9toile de David est imprim\u00e9e sur une photo du plaignant est particuli\u00e8rement troublant. Cela fait incontestablement penser \u00e0 une cible.\n[120] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tellement angoiss\u00e9 par le dernier message affich\u00e9 qu'il a communiqu\u00e9 avec la police afin de d\u00e9cider si des accusations d'avoir prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des menaces pourraient \u00eatre port\u00e9es contre l'intim\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement consult\u00e9 un avocat concernant la possibilit\u00e9 de demander l'\u00e9mission d'un engagement de ne pas troubler l'ordre public contre l'intim\u00e9. Dans le contexte des autres messages de l'intim\u00e9 encourageant l'annihilation des Juifs, j'estime que les messages pouvaient raisonnablement \u00eatre per\u00e7us comme \u00e9tant des repr\u00e9sailles ou des menaces de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[121] Il faut d\u00e9cider si les messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s en repr\u00e9sailles contre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre l'intim\u00e9.\n[122] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'il existait depuis longtemps de l'animosit\u00e9 entre le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9. Il ressort clairement de la preuve que le plaignant a pris un certain nombre de mesures contre l'intim\u00e9 en vue de l'emp\u00eacher d'utiliser Internet pour diffuser des messages haineux. En ao\u00fbt et septembre 2003, le plaignant s'est plaint au fournisseur de services Internet de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 propos du site Web de ce dernier. Par la suite, le site Web de l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9.\n[123] Le 7 septembre 2003, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre l'intim\u00e9. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cette plainte, il a pris d'autres mesures contre l'intim\u00e9, notamment les mesures suivantes : il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la police de London \u00e0 propos des messages Internet de l'intim\u00e9, il a particip\u00e9 avec un certain nombre d'autres organismes \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction d'une lettre ouverte demandant que l'on prenne des mesures contre l'intim\u00e9, il a communiqu\u00e9 des renseignements \u00e0 un journaliste du London Free Press \u00e0 propos de l'intim\u00e9 et il a prononc\u00e9 un discours lors d'une conf\u00e9rence \u00e0 Toronto apr\u00e8s laquelle on a discut\u00e9 du cas de l'intim\u00e9.\n[124] L'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait manifestement en col\u00e8re contre le plaignant parce que celui-ci avait pris ces mesures contre lui et contre d'autres nationalistes Blancs. Il a v\u00e9hicul\u00e9 sa col\u00e8re dans la s\u00e9rie de messages susmentionn\u00e9s qu'il a affich\u00e9s dans le groupe de discussion du VNN. Tous ces messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Toutefois, il n'est pas fait mention dans tous ces messages de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l'intim\u00e9.\n[125] Dans la d\u00e9cision Bressette, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsqu'il existe depuis longtemps un conflit entre le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9, il peut \u00eatre difficile de d\u00e9terminer si certains incidents se sont tout simplement produits en raison du conflit persistant ou en raison de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (Bressette, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 52). Le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 dans cette cause une approche qui, selon moi, convient en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[126] Le membre du Tribunal dans Bressette a d'abord d\u00e9cid\u00e9 s'il pouvait accepter, prima facie, que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne constituait \u00e0 tout le moins un des facteurs qui avaient eu une incidence sur la diff\u00e9rence de traitement dont le plaignant avait fait l'objet. Apr\u00e8s qu'il eut conclu qu'il pouvait accepter cette affirmation, il incombait alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication cr\u00e9dible quant \u00e0 ce traitement.\n[127] Bien que ce n'est pas dans tous les messages qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait mention de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne du plaignant contre l'intim\u00e9, je crois qu'il est raisonnable de percevoir que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte constituait \u00e0 tout le moins un des facteurs qui a influenc\u00e9 la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 envers le plaignant. Les messages ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Dans au moins trois des messages affich\u00e9s, il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment fait mention de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre l'intim\u00e9 ou de l'utilisation par le plaignant du processus en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne pour extorquer de l'argent \u00e0 des personnes comme l'intim\u00e9.\n[128] Manifestement, d'autres mesures prises par le plaignant ont mis l'intim\u00e9 en col\u00e8re et ont pu jouer un r\u00f4le dans la diffusion par l'intim\u00e9 de messages de menace concernant le plaignant. Toutefois, l'intim\u00e9, qui a d'ailleurs choisi de ne pas t\u00e9moigner, n'a fourni absolument aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui permettrait d'\u00e9carter la conclusion que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre lui constituait \u00e0 tout le moins un des facteurs qui a eu une incidence sur sa d\u00e9cision d'afficher les messages.\nLa conclusion concernant les repr\u00e9sailles\n[129] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que les messages susmentionn\u00e9s constituent des repr\u00e9sailles ou des menaces de repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant parce que celui-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, et ce, en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la Loi.\nIV. LES REDRESSEMENTS [130] L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 plusieurs arguments g\u00e9n\u00e9raux concernant les redressements qui m\u00e9ritent d'\u00eatre discut\u00e9s. Premi\u00e8rement, l'avocate a pr\u00e9tendu qu'ordonner le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 et d'une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 ne conviendraient pas en l'esp\u00e8ce car l'ordonnance d'interdiction a \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul recours qui a fait l'objet d'un examen constitutionnel de la part de la Cour supr\u00eame dans Taylor. Par cons\u00e9quent, tout autre redressement est incertain au point de vue constitutionnel. Cet argument ne tient pas compte du fait que, dans Schnell, le Tribunal a conclu que les dispositions relatives \u00e0 la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans les modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi apr\u00e8s l'arr\u00eat Taylor ne rendaient pas le paragraphe 13(1) inconstitutionnel. De plus, pour les motifs que j'invoquerai \u00e0 la section qui traite des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c), je crois que le Tribunal ne peut pas refuser d'appliquer la loi pour des raisons d'incertitude constitutionnelle.\n[131] Le deuxi\u00e8me argument de l'intim\u00e9 est que la fa\u00e7on dont s'est conduit le plaignant milite contre l'attribution d'une indemnit\u00e9 ou d'une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, l'avocate a pr\u00e9tendu que la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que, non seulement le plaignant a encourag\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 violer la Loi, mais qu'il a \u00e9galement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la violation de la Loi et \u00e0 la violation de l'injonction \u00e9mise par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L'avocate a de plus pr\u00e9tendu que le plaignant s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s violentes et \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s criminelles. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu que la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance contre l'intim\u00e9 aurait pour effet de tol\u00e9rer la conduite du plaignant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et que, par cons\u00e9quent, aucune ordonnance ne devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9e.\n[132] L'intim\u00e9 est libre de poursuivre dans le forum appropri\u00e9 toute cause d'action qu'il pourrait avoir quant \u00e0 la conduite du plaignant. Toutefois, mon examen de la preuve se limite \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si cette preuve a une incidence sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant en ce qui concerne le pr\u00e9judice moral dont il a souffert \u00e0 la suite de la diffusion des messages de repr\u00e9sailles. Au-del\u00e0 de cette question, la preuve n'a aucune pertinence.\n[133] Bien qu'il soit courant de traiter des redressements quant \u00e0 la violation de la disposition relative \u00e0 la propagande haineuse avant de traiter des repr\u00e9sailles, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renverser cet ordre, et ce, comme il appara\u00eetra plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, pour des raisons de coh\u00e9rence logique.\nA. Les repr\u00e9sailles - L'article 14.1 [134] L'article 14.1 pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre une personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. L'article 53 autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9livrer certaines ordonnances contre une personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire. Le paragraphe 53(2) pr\u00e9voit une vaste gamme d'ordonnances qui peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9es par le Tribunal.\n[135] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission et le plaignant ont demand\u00e9 que les ordonnances suivantes soient d\u00e9livr\u00e9es :\nUne ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de cesser d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant parce que celui-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre lui; Une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de verser au plaignant une somme de 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral; Une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de verser au plaignant une somme de 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale; Une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9dommager le plaignant quant aux frais qu'il a engag\u00e9s en rapport avec l'audience et qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assum\u00e9s par la Commission.\n(i) L'ordonnance d'interdiction [136] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance d'interdiction lui enverrait un message inappropri\u00e9. Elle lui transmettrait l'id\u00e9e que, dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne, il est interdit d'avoir des pens\u00e9es d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables. Cette affirmation est erron\u00e9e. Il est permis de transmettre publiquement des messages d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables tant et aussi longtemps qu'ils ne violent pas la loi. En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'intim\u00e9 a viol\u00e9 l'article 14.1 de la Loi en exer\u00e7ant des repr\u00e9sailles ou en mena\u00e7ant d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant au moyen de messages Internet. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il a fait cela jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'audience de la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne commence. On ne doit pas permettre qu'une telle conduite ill\u00e9gale se poursuive.\n[137] Par cons\u00e9quent, en conformit\u00e9 avec l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi, il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de cesser d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant parce qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Cette ordonnance vaut pour les actes de repr\u00e9sailles, notamment pour la diffusion, dans le groupe de discussion du VNN ou ailleurs sur Internet, de messages qui sont similaires aux documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve durant l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de cesser imm\u00e9diatement d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles d\u00e8s qu'il prendra connaissance de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\n(ii) L'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral [138] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) permet au Tribunal d'ordonner que l'intim\u00e9 indemnise la victime jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral dont elle a souffert par suite de l'acte discriminatoire.\n[139] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, dans le contexte du d\u00e9sir exprim\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 de voir le monde se d\u00e9barrasser des Juifs et, sachant ce qu'il sait sur la Seconde Guerre mondiale, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 angoiss\u00e9 par les renvois r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s qu'on a fait \u00e0 lui en tant que Juif. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 angoiss\u00e9 parce que les messages \u00e9taient affich\u00e9s dans un groupe de discussion n\u00e9onazi assez important. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y a souvent eu de la violence au sein du mouvement n\u00e9onazi et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il craignait de se faire agresser.\n[140] Cette crainte a augment\u00e9 lorsqu'il a vu sa photo avec l'\u00e9toile de David imprim\u00e9e sur son front. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le fait que l'on ait imprim\u00e9 l'\u00e9toile de David sur son front lui a donn\u00e9 l'impression qu'une cible avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e sur son front. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a communiqu\u00e9 avec la police afin de d\u00e9cider si des accusations d'avoir prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des menaces pourraient \u00eatre port\u00e9es contre l'intim\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement consult\u00e9 un avocat quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de demander l'\u00e9mission d'un engagement de ne pas troubler l'ordre public contre l'intim\u00e9.\n[141] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce point angoiss\u00e9 qu'il conviendrait qu'on lui accorde une indemnit\u00e9 de 20 000 $. Il s'agit du montant maximum permis par l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi.\n[142] L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu qu'on ne devait pas croire le plaignant lorsqu'il affirme dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e0 la suite de la diffusion des messages de repr\u00e9sailles. L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 a soumis un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui, selon elle, discr\u00e9dite le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[143] L'avocate a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que, selon elle, il ressortait de la preuve que la conduite du plaignant dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce point r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible qu'il ne conviendrait pas d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Cet argument va toutefois \u00e0 l'encontre des d\u00e9clarations faites par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Pitawanakwat c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) [1994] 3 C.F. 298. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, la Cour a affirm\u00e9 que refuser une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral en raison de la conduite du plaignant \u00e9quivaut en fait \u00e0 tol\u00e9rer la discrimination pour un motif de discrimination illicite chaque fois que le comportement du plaignant est loin d'\u00eatre exemplaire.\n[144] Par cons\u00e9quent, mon examen de la preuve qui suit se limite strictement \u00e0 son incidence sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant lorsqu'il pr\u00e9tend avoir souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\nLa preuve quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue du pr\u00e9judice moral souffert par le plaignant\n[145] La preuve quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant comprenait les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants : une d\u00e9claration par le plaignant contre M. Paul Fromm pour libelle, deux enregistrements vid\u00e9o concernant la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e participation du plaignant \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s violentes, des notes provenant d'un discours que le plaignant a fait \u00e0 la r\u00e9union annuelle de l'ARA; des articles de journaux concernant le plaignant \u00e9crits par M. Randy Richmond et publi\u00e9s dans le London Free Press, des messages que le plaignant a \u00e9crits puis affich\u00e9s dans le groupe de discussion du VNN.\n[146] J'ai permis que la preuve soit admise parce qu'elle \u00e9tait pertinente quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si le plaignant a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e0 la suite des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es contre lui par l'intim\u00e9. Toutefois, j'ai pris en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ma d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 l'importance que j'accorderais \u00e0 la preuve jusqu'au moment de rendre ma d\u00e9cision, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu l'ensemble de la cause.\nL'action en libelle et l'article du London Free Press \u00e9crit par Randy Richmond\n[147] L'intim\u00e9 a soumis une d\u00e9claration d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant la Cour de justice de l'Ontario par le plaignant dans laquelle celui-ci mentionne qu'il poursuit M. Paul Fromm pour de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es d\u00e9clarations calomnieuses et diffamatoires que celui-ci aurait faites. L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement produit un article de journal paru le 31 mars 2005 dans le London Free Press dans lequel un certain nombre de ces pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es d\u00e9clarations diffamatoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduites. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, M. Fromm aurait notamment qualifi\u00e9 le plaignant de [Traduction] grand pr\u00eatre de la censure. Ce qualificatif a \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduit dans l'article de M. Richmond paru dans le Free Press. Le plaignant a admis qu'il a fourni \u00e0 M. Richmond un certain nombre des citations que ce dernier a reproduites dans son article.\n[148] On a pr\u00e9tendu que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrait que l'on ne doit pas croire le plaignant lorsqu'il affirme qu'il a souffert parce que, d'une part, il a poursuivi M. Fromm pour des d\u00e9clarations que celui-ci aurait fait sur lui et, d'autre part, il a offert ces m\u00eames d\u00e9clarations \u00e0 M. Richmond et ne s'est pas plaint lorsqu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduites dans l'article du London Free Press.\n[149] J'accorde peu d'importance \u00e0 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. Premi\u00e8rement, il ne prouve pas que le plaignant n'a souffert d'aucun pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e0 la suite des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es remarques diffamatoires. Deuxi\u00e8mement, les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es d\u00e9clarations diffamatoires sont diff\u00e9rentes des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s messages de repr\u00e9sailles dont il est question en l'esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne serait pas raisonnable que, dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, je tire des conclusions quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9action du plaignant aux messages de repr\u00e9sailles en me fondant sur les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es d\u00e9clarations diffamatoires dont il est question dans l'autre cause.\n[150] Les notes d'allocution du plaignant pour un discours intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Perturbation maximum : Barrer la route aux n\u00e9onazis par (presque) tous les moyens n\u00e9cessaires et l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o de la couverture de la manifestation Zundel par la CBC\n[151] Une copie des notes d'allocution du plaignant quant \u00e0 un expos\u00e9 qu'il a fait le 6 juillet 2005 lors de la r\u00e9union annuelle d'un groupe appel\u00e9 Anti-Racist Action (ARA) a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve. Le discours du plaignant \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9 : Perturbation maximum : Barrer la route aux n\u00e9onazis par (presque) tous les moyens n\u00e9cessaires. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'est pas membre de l'ARA. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 par le groupe \u00e0 prononcer le discours en question et que celui-ci \u00e9tait semblable \u00e0 ceux qu'il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 prononc\u00e9s lors d'autres \u00e9v\u00e9nements.\n[152] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 qu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans son discours ce qu'il a appel\u00e9 une [Traduction] strat\u00e9gie d'attaque tous azimuts contre les activit\u00e9s n\u00e9onazies au Canada. Cette strat\u00e9gie consiste \u00e0 travailler avec la police, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ainsi qu'avec d'autres organismes afin de cr\u00e9er une perturbation maximum au sein de ce qui constitue, selon le plaignant, le mouvement n\u00e9onazi au Canada. Le plaignant a analys\u00e9 trois cas diff\u00e9rents dont il s'est occup\u00e9 et il a fait ressortir l'effet qu'avait eu la strat\u00e9gie d'attaque tous azimuts.\n[153] Les notes du plaignant mentionnent qu'il se sert de la strat\u00e9gie de la perturbation maximum lorsqu'elle constitue la strat\u00e9gie la plus utile ou lorsqu'il estime tout simplement qu'elle constitue la strat\u00e9gie la plus amusante. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans ses notes que s'il estimait qu'une personne \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement aga\u00e7ante, il faisait monter son nom d'un cran sur sa liste.\n[154] En contre-interrogatoire, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que c'\u00e9tait pour faire de l'humour qu'il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son discours qu'il avait tir\u00e9 du plaisir de la strat\u00e9gie de la perturbation maximum et qu'il faisait monter sur la liste les noms des personnes qu'il estimait aga\u00e7antes. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, comme tout le monde, il \u00e9prouvait un certain plaisir \u00e0 faire du travail utile, mais que le travail qui consiste \u00e0 emp\u00eacher les nationalistes Blancs de faire de la propagande haineuse sur Internet avait occasionn\u00e9, \u00e0 lui et \u00e0 sa famille, de graves ennuis.\n[155] Le cas de l'intim\u00e9 est l'un des trois cas discut\u00e9s par le plaignant dans son discours. Le cas d'Ernst Zundel en fut un autre. Dans le contexte de sa discussion du cas Zundel, le plaignant a exprim\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 de graves incidents qui se sont produits alors que des lettres pi\u00e9g\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Zundel et que son bunker a \u00e9t\u00e9 gravement endommag\u00e9 par un pyromane.\n[156] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il voulait montrer une photo de l'intim\u00e9 durant son discours. Toutefois, le mat\u00e9riel n\u00e9cessaire pour projeter la photo n'\u00e9tait pas disponible et, par cons\u00e9quent, il n'a pas pu la montrer.\n[157] Durant l'audience, j'ai visionn\u00e9 un enregistrement vid\u00e9o d'une \u00e9mission de la CBC montrant une confrontation physique qui a eu lieu entre les membres de l'ARA et les pro-Zundel lors d'une manifestation visant \u00e0 appuyer M. Zundel en septembre 2004. Dans son discours \u00e0 l'ARA, le plaignant a soulign\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la manifestation d'appui \u00e0 Zundel et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d'une infraction criminelle car on avait trouv\u00e9 des armes dans son automobile lors de cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit dans son discours : [Traduction] La manifestation \u00e0 laquelle ils se rendaient \u00e9taient une manifestation \u00e0 laquelle Anti-Racist Action Toronto serait \u00e9videmment pr\u00e9sente afin de voir \u00e0 ce qu'il y ait une opposition \u00e0 l'appui populaire de l'une des pires personnes qui nient l'existence de l'Holocauste.\n[158] J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que ces remarques indiquent que le plaignant approuvait tacitement la violence qui a \u00e9clat\u00e9 lors de la manifestation d'appui \u00e0 Zundel. Je ne vois aucune raison de conclure de la sorte. Le plaignant ne fait aucune mention dans son discours de la confrontation physique qui a eu lieu entre les deux groupes. Le fait qu'il n'ait pas mentionn\u00e9 la confrontation n'indique pas, selon moi, qu'il approuve la violence qui a \u00e9clat\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la manifestation. Par ailleurs, selon moi, que le plaignant ait oui ou non approuv\u00e9 les tactiques de l'ARA ainsi que sa pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e tendance \u00e0 la violence n'est pas pertinent quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si celui-ci a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e0 la suite des messages de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[159] Toutefois, j'estime que les notes d'allocution du plaignant r\u00e9v\u00e8lent une certaine fermet\u00e9 d'esprit, voir m\u00eame un go\u00fbt pour les affrontements. Sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 tirer du plaisir de sa strat\u00e9gie de perturbation maximum et de l'utiliser pour s'occuper des personnes qu'ils estiment aga\u00e7antes, r\u00e9v\u00e8le un degr\u00e9 d'indiff\u00e9rence au pr\u00e9judice moral dont peuvent souffrir un certain nombre de victimes \u00e0 la suite de mesures de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[160] J'estime \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que le plaignant voulait montrer une photo de l'intim\u00e9 aux membres de l'ARA et le traiter de [Traduction] t\u00eate d\u00e9gueulasse quelques mois seulement apr\u00e8s que l'intim\u00e9 eut affich\u00e9 une photo de lui sur Internet. La nature et le ton de cette r\u00e9action r\u00e9v\u00e8lent une tol\u00e9rance qui n'est pas compatible avec sa pr\u00e9tention d'avoir beaucoup souffert \u00e0 la suite de la diffusion des messages de repr\u00e9sailles de l'intim\u00e9.\n[161] Je conclus, toutefois, qu'il faut accorder peu d'importance \u00e0 l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o de la confrontation entre les membres de l'ARA et les partisans de Zundel. Le plaignant n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la confrontation et, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9, je ne vois rien dans la preuve qui indique que le plaignant a approuv\u00e9 la violence qui a \u00e9clat\u00e9 lors de la manifestation. Je maintiens la d\u00e9cision que j'ai rendue durant l'audience \u00e0 savoir que la question de savoir si l'ARA est un organisme violent ou non n'est pas une question pertinente \u00e0 l'instruction.\nL'enregistrement vid\u00e9o se rapportant \u00e0 David Icke\n[162] On a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 durant l'audience un enregistrement vid\u00e9o concernant la participation du plaignant \u00e0 des actes commis contre une personne du nom de David Icke qui se trouvait \u00e0 Vancouver il y a un certain nombre d'ann\u00e9es dans le cadre d'une tourn\u00e9e de conf\u00e9rences. M. Icke, qui a \u00e9crit un livre dans lequel il est question d'une th\u00e9orie de complot, \u00e9tait apparemment consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par certaines personnes comme \u00e9tant un promoteur de l'antis\u00e9mitisme.\n[163] L'enregistrement vid\u00e9o, en grande partie, traite des activit\u00e9s et des croyances de M. Icke. Toutefois, \u00e0 un certain moment dans l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o, on peut voir le plaignant en train de boire une bi\u00e8re et de discuter d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement en compagnie d'un certain nombre de personnes dans une librairie de Vancouver o\u00f9 M. Icke devait se rendre pour signer son livre. Bien que cela ne soit pas tout \u00e0 fait clair, il semblerait que le plaignant aurait propos\u00e9 que l'on tire une tarte au visage de M. Icke lors de la s\u00e9ance de signature du livre. On peut voir dans l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o que la tarte fut \u00e9ventuellement tir\u00e9e au visage de M. Icke.\n[164] J'accorde peu d'importance \u00e0 l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o. Il montre des incidents qui se sont produits en mars 2000. Ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s bien avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Toutefois, il \u00e9taye un peu la conclusion que le plaignant poss\u00e8de un esprit combatif qui peut le rendre indiff\u00e9rent \u00e0 des comportements mena\u00e7ants.\nLa participation du plaignant au groupe de discussion du VNN et sa collaboration avec les journalistes\n[165] Le plaignant a particip\u00e9 au groupe de discussion du VNN sous le pseudonyme Axetogrind. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a fait cela afin de surveiller ce site Web. Pour ce faire, il s'est fait passer pour une personne qui \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e par les id\u00e9es ou qui appuyait les id\u00e9es qui \u00e9taient exprim\u00e9es dans le groupe de discussion. Il posait des questions du genre : [Traduction] Alors, vous allez nous faire attendre?. Et parfois, il faisait part de son accord avec des remarques faites dans le groupe de discussion. En contre-interrogatoire, on a demand\u00e9 au plaignant s'il tentait, par ses questions, d'attirer davantage d'ennuis \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait pos\u00e9 les questions afin d'obtenir des \u00e9claircissements sur des questions que l'intim\u00e9 avait soulev\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le plaignant a affich\u00e9 32 messages dans le groupe de discussion du VNN.\n[166] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a fourni aux journalistes des extraits des messages de l'intim\u00e9.\n[167] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que le fait que le plaignant ait particip\u00e9 au groupe de discussion du VNN et qu'il ait fourni des extraits de messages aux journalistes d\u00e9montre que le plaignant n'est pas particuli\u00e8rement sensible aux genres de remarques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sur son compte dans les messages de repr\u00e9sailles. Cela est discutable. Je crois que m\u00eame la personne la plus aguerrie peut souffrir psychologiquement lorsque les \u00e9changes entre deux adversaires se transforment en attaques. Toutefois, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui se passe chez d'autres victimes de mesures de repr\u00e9sailles, la preuve que le plaignant a particip\u00e9 au groupe de discussion du VNN et qu'il a remis \u00e0 un journaliste des extraits de messages, conjugu\u00e9e avec la preuve que le plaignant a fait campagne contre les messages haineux, donne \u00e0 penser qu'un certain d\u00e9tachement \u00e9motif et qu'une certaine insensibilit\u00e9 aient pu appara\u00eetre chez le plaignant.\nLa conclusion concernant le pr\u00e9judice moral souffert par le plaignant\n[168] Je crois que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris d'angoisse lorsqu'il a lu les messages le d\u00e9crivant comme un inf\u00e2me Juif acide un pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 juif et ainsi de suite. Dans le contexte de l'animosit\u00e9 clairement exprim\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 envers les Juifs, on peut comprendre que le plaignant soit angoiss\u00e9. Toutefois, je ne suis pas convaincu que le degr\u00e9 d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il a souffert justifie l'attribution de l'indemnit\u00e9 maximum pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e).\n[169] Selon la preuve, le plaignant poss\u00e8de une grande exp\u00e9rience et il est tr\u00e8s engag\u00e9 dans les activit\u00e9s organis\u00e9es visant \u00e0 combattre la propagande haineuse. En effet, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 parler \u00e0 un certain nombre d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements publics en raison de son expertise dans ce domaine. Une personne qui participe \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s de cette nature doit s'attendre \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement confront\u00e9e \u00e0 des propos injurieux ainsi qu'\u00e0 des comportements mena\u00e7ants. N\u00e9anmoins, il existe toujours une limite et lorsqu'elle est franchie, la situation devient subitement beaucoup plus grave. L'intim\u00e9 a-t-il franchi cette limite lorsqu'il a affich\u00e9 une photo du plaignant avec une \u00e9toile de David imprim\u00e9e sur son front en guise de cible?\n[170] Le probl\u00e8me que pose la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant d'avoir beaucoup souffert est qu'un mois ou deux apr\u00e8s que sa photo fut affich\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de d\u00e9clarer publiquement, dans un discours prononc\u00e9 devant l'ARA, qu'il utilisait sa strat\u00e9gie de perturbation maximum, laquelle comprenait le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne lorsqu'il croit qu'il s'agit de la strat\u00e9gie la plus utile ou lorsqu'il estime que c'est ce qui sera le plus amusant. Il a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 qu'il d\u00e9pose des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre les n\u00e9onazis en commen\u00e7ant par les pires contrevenants, et s'il estime que des personnes sont particuli\u00e8rement aga\u00e7antes, il monte leur nom d'un cran sur la liste.\n[171] Il me semble que le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9 ont quelque peu crois\u00e9 le fer et que cela n'a pas sembl\u00e9 avoir paralys\u00e9 le plaignant de peur. En effet, bien qu'il ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la photo de lui qui fut affich\u00e9 dans Internet, le plaignant voulait par la suite montrer publiquement la photo de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence de l'ARA, et dans son discours il a trait\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 de t\u00eate d\u00e9gueulasse. Ce genre de comportement ne donne pas \u00e0 penser qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9. Au contraire, ce comportement donne \u00e0 penser qu'il faisait preuve d'une attitude plut\u00f4t cavali\u00e8re, voir m\u00eame qu'il se moquait des activit\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9. Je souscris \u00e0 l'opinion de l'intim\u00e9 que cela rend plut\u00f4t invraisemblable la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant qu'il a tellement souffert qu'il serait justifi\u00e9 de lui accorder une indemnit\u00e9 de l'ordre de 20 000,00 $.\n[172] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que bien que le plaignant a probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 pris d'une certaine angoisse quant aux messages de repr\u00e9sailles, il semble \u00eatre un homme tr\u00e8s fort qui est plut\u00f4t insensible aux menaces et aux insultes. Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, je crois qu'il serait appropri\u00e9 d'accorder au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 de 500 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\n(iii) L'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [173] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[174] Je conclus que l'intim\u00e9 voulait exercer des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou qu'il a agi sans se soucier des cons\u00e9quences qui pourraient d\u00e9couler de l'affichage des messages concernant le plaignant.\n[175] Deux messages prouvent notamment que l'intim\u00e9 a intentionnellement exerc\u00e9 ou a menac\u00e9 d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant parce que celui-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre lui. Dans le message qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 le 13 mars 2004, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rep\u00e9r\u00e9 par le radar juif lorsqu'un inf\u00e2me Juif acide - Richard Warman (celui-ci affirme ne pas \u00eatre Juif) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre lui.\n[176] Le deuxi\u00e8me message est celui que l'intim\u00e9 a diffus\u00e9 en mai 2005 et dans lequel il a affich\u00e9, sous le titre Mes ennemis, la photo du plaignant avec l'\u00e9toile de David blasonn\u00e9e sur le front de ce dernier. Dans ce m\u00eame fil de discussion, l'intim\u00e9 a fourni un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ou une liste des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9s contre les Nationalistes blancs et il a inscrit au premier rang sur cette liste la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui. Le fait que les mots Mes ennemis furent affich\u00e9s pr\u00e8s de la liste des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne peut nous amener \u00e0 conclure que l'affichage des ennemis constituait des repr\u00e9sailles ou une menace de repr\u00e9sailles quant \u00e0 la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[177] Compte tenu de la preuve susmentionn\u00e9e, on peut raisonnablement conclure que les autres messages dans lesquels l'intim\u00e9 parle du plaignant en termes p\u00e9joratifs et mena\u00e7ants faisaient partie d'une campagne intentionnelle orchestr\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 dans le but d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant. Bien qu'il y ait d'autres raisons qui auraient pu amener l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 cibler le plaignant, rien n'indique qu'il ciblait le plaignant avant que la plainte ne fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que c'est le d\u00e9p\u00f4t par le plaignant de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 le facteur important qui a amen\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui.\n[178] Afin de fixer le montant appropri\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3), le Tribunal porte son attention sur le comportement de l'intim\u00e9 et non pas sur l'effet qu'a eu son comportement sur le plaignant (voir par exemple : Milano c. Triple K. Transport Ltd. 2003 TCDP 30; Woiden c. Lynn [2002] D.C.D.P. no 18 (Q.L.); Bressette c. Conseil de Bande de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Kettle et Stony Point, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e; Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e). Les effets de la conduite sont pris en compte lorsqu'une indemnit\u00e9 est accord\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi.\n[179] L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que le mot indemnit\u00e9 s'entend d'une indemnit\u00e9 pour une perte, m\u00eame s'il s'agit d'une perte intangible. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut tenir compte de l'importance du pr\u00e9judice qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9 au plaignant par les mesures de repr\u00e9sailles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es contre lui lorsque l'on fixe le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3).\n[180] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette opinion. Selon moi, le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 53(3) indique clairement que le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 est ordonn\u00e9 lorsque la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Rien dans le paragraphe 53(3) n'indique qu'il faut prouver que la victime a souffert un pr\u00e9judice afin d'ordonner le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9. La disposition figurant au paragraphe 53(3) quant au paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 pour des actes discriminatoires d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s est distincte de la disposition figurant \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), laquelle pr\u00e9voit le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Le paragraphe 53(3) ne fait aucune mention du paragraphe 53(2). Par cons\u00e9quent, selon moi, le paragraphe 53(3) vise le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 pour une conduite discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e sans \u00e9gard aux effets qu'elle peut avoir sur le plaignant. Les effets du comportement de l'intim\u00e9 sont pris en compte lorsque le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 est ordonn\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi.\n[181] Compte tenu du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 du comportement discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9 et compte tenu, notamment, de l'utilisation \u00e9hont\u00e9e qu'il a faite de la photo du plaignant montrant celui-ci avec ce qui semblait \u00eatre une cible sur son front, je suis d'avis qu'il convient d'accorder un montant de 5 000 $ au titre de l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\n(iv) Les frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience [182] La Commission a demand\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 verse une indemnit\u00e9 raisonnable au plaignant au titre des frais de d\u00e9placement, de repas et de logement engag\u00e9s par le plaignant afin de pouvoir assister \u00e0 l'audience. La Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le lieu de l'audience ne se trouvait pas \u00e0 une distance raisonnable du lieu de r\u00e9sidence du plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant a engag\u00e9 des frais qu'il n'aurait pas engag\u00e9s s'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'une pratique discriminatoire. La Commission a pay\u00e9 une partie de ces frais parce que le plaignant a comparu comme t\u00e9moin pour la Commission. Toutefois, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que, en conformit\u00e9 avec l'objectif de remettre l'intim\u00e9 dans son \u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieur, l'intim\u00e9 devrait rembourser au plaignant la partie de ses frais de d\u00e9placement, de repas et de logement qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fray\u00e9s par la Commission. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en vue d'\u00e9tablir le montant de ces frais.\n[183] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) pr\u00e9voit que, si la plainte est fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal peut ordonner que la victime soit indemnis\u00e9e quant aux d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire. Le pouvoir d'ordonner le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par cette disposition, comme dans le cas de toutes les ordonnances rendues en vertu du paragraphe 53, est discr\u00e9tionnaire. Il est vrai que le Tribunal est guid\u00e9 par le principe de remise de la victime dans son \u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieur lorsqu'il exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9paration. Toutefois, ce ne sont pas tous les frais engag\u00e9s en rapport avec l'audition d'une cause par un tribunal qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s suffisamment li\u00e9s \u00e0 la pratique discriminatoire pour permettre qu'ils soient vis\u00e9s par l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c). Par exemple, dans Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Lambie, (1996), 124 F.T.R. 303 (C.F. 1re inst.), paragraphe 41, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que le mot d\u00e9pense n'est pas assez large pour couvrir le temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration pour une audience sauf dans des circonstances exceptionnelles.\n[184] Il n'est pas du tout certain que les d\u00e9penses de d\u00e9placement, de repas et de logement sont le genre de d\u00e9penses qui sont vis\u00e9es par l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c). En effet, l'avocate de la Commission a admis qu'elle n'avait trouv\u00e9 aucune jurisprudence quant \u00e0 l'attribution de ce genre d'indemnit\u00e9. Contrairement \u00e0 la situation dans Brown c. G.R.C., 2004 TCDP 30, les d\u00e9penses en l'esp\u00e8ce ne sont pas directement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation d'une cause devant le Tribunal; elles ne sont pas directement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de la cause elle-m\u00eame. En outre, selon moi, il n'y a rien d'exceptionnel quant aux circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce qui justifierait d'ordonner le remboursement des frais de d\u00e9placement, de repas et de logement.\n[185] Le plaignant, lequel a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il est avocat, s'est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 l'audience. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, dont le r\u00f4le consiste \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par deux avocats. Bien que ce ne soit pas toujours le cas, dans la pr\u00e9sente instruction, les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la Commission correspondaient \u00e0 ceux du plaignant. En effet, la Commission a appel\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et, par cons\u00e9quent, selon l'avocate de la Commission, elle a pu payer certains des frais que le plaignant a engag\u00e9s en raison de sa participation \u00e0 l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[186] Pour ces motifs, je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il conviendrait d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de rembourser au plaignant ses frais de d\u00e9placement, de repas et de logement. Par cons\u00e9quent, je refuse de rendre l'ordonnance demand\u00e9e par la Commission en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c).\n(v) Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [187] Le paragraphe 53(4) autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur le montant accord\u00e9 en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s en conformit\u00e9 avec le paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats commenceront \u00e0 courir \u00e0 compter de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision jusqu'\u00e0 la date de paiement. Toutefois, en aucun cas, la somme totale payable en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), y compris les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne devra exc\u00e9der 20 000 $ : H\u00e9bert c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), (1993), 23 C.H.R.R. D\/ 107 (C.F. 1re inst.). Il en va de m\u00eame pour la somme pay\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 53(3).\nB. La propagande haineuse - l'article 13 [188] L'article 54 \u00e9num\u00e8re les ordonnances qui peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9es en rapport avec la propagande haineuse. Il comprend, par renvoi, certaines ordonnances qui peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 53 quant \u00e0 d'autres cas de discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, une ordonnance peut \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9e en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) et comprendre, entre autres mesures, une ordonnance que la personne mette fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire. De plus, l'article 54 permet que soit d\u00e9livr\u00e9e l'ordonnance pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3) pour indemniser une victime dont on a fait express\u00e9ment mention dans les messages discriminatoires. Enfin, l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) pr\u00e9voit l'imposition d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire d'au plus 10 000 $.\n[189] La Commission et le plaignant ont demand\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLa d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de cesser de transmettre des messages comme ceux qui ont fait l'objet d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 13; La d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de verser au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 20 000 $. la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de 10 000 $.\n(i) L'ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir [190] L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir produirait des effets ind\u00e9sirables. Elle enverrait le message qu'on ne peut pas avoir des pens\u00e9es d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables au Canada et elle peut, en fait, favoriser l'expression de ces pens\u00e9es par d'autres moyens qui sont moins pacifiques que les messages diffus\u00e9s sur Internet. Enfin, la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir ne servirait qu'\u00e0 isoler davantage l'intim\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne.\n[191] Je ne puis souscrire \u00e0 cette opinion. L'intim\u00e9 est libre d'exprimer ses pens\u00e9es et ses id\u00e9es, m\u00eames si elles sont tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables, pourvu qu'elles ne violent pas la loi. L'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas t\u00e9moigner durant l'audience. Toutefois, bien qu'il se soit repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame au d\u00e9but de l'audience et durant le processus de gestion de l'instance, il m'a donn\u00e9 l'impression d'\u00eatre un homme respectueux, raisonnable et direct. Il ne s'est pas conduit d'une mani\u00e8re belliqueuse. Il a tent\u00e9 de faire valoir son point de vue d'une mani\u00e8re mesur\u00e9e. Il est \u00e0 souhaiter que, \u00e0 l'avenir, l'intim\u00e9 fasse preuve du m\u00eame sang-froid et du m\u00eame respect dans les communications qu'il aura par Internet avec le reste du monde.\n[192] Il importe \u00e9galement de souligner que, en d\u00e9cidant si je dois d\u00e9livrer une ordonnance d'interdiction, l'effet possible de cette ordonnance sur l'intim\u00e9 n'est pas le seul facteur dont je dois tenir compte. Je dois \u00e9galement tenir compte de l'effet probable de la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance d'interdiction sur les autres membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne comme ceux qui sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris par suite des messages diffus\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l'a soulign\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Taylor, le processus consistant \u00e0 entendre une plainte port\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) et, si la plainte est fond\u00e9e, \u00e0 rendre une ordonnance d'interdit, rappelle aux Canadiens notre engagement fondamental envers l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances et l'\u00e9limination de l'intol\u00e9rance raciale et religieuse (Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 53). Par cons\u00e9quent, selon moi, la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance d'interdiction est tout \u00e0 fait appropri\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[193] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, M. Tomasz Winnicki, de mettre fin \u00e0 sa pratique discriminatoire qui consiste \u00e0 transmettre par les moyens d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, \u00e0 savoir Internet, des documents du genre de ceux qui, en l'esp\u00e8ce, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s contraires au paragraphe 13(1), ou tout autre document dont la teneur est essentiellement semblable et qui serait susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite.\n(ii) L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) - l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [194] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9livrer l'ordonnance pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3), avec ou sans int\u00e9r\u00eats, pour indemniser la victime identifi\u00e9e dans la communication constituant l'acte discriminatoire. Le paragraphe 53(3) mentionne que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[195] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que les huit messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s contraires \u00e0 l'article 14.1 constituaient \u00e9galement des violations au paragraphe 13(1). J'ai souscris \u00e0 cette opinion et j'ai conclu que ces m\u00eames messages violaient les deux dispositions de la Loi. J'ai accord\u00e9 au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) ainsi qu'une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) compte tenu du fait que l'acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[196] La Commission a ensuite pr\u00e9tendu que le plaignant avait \u00e9galement droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) en rapport avec cette m\u00eame s\u00e9rie de huit messages. Selon la Commission, il \u00e9tait manifeste au vu des huit messages dans lesquels l'intim\u00e9 fait express\u00e9ment mention du plaignant que c'est exactement ce qu'il voulait faire. La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que l'attribution d'une indemnit\u00e9 de 20 000 $ serait appropri\u00e9e compte tenu du caract\u00e8re manifestement intentionnel du comportement de l'intim\u00e9.\n[197] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu qu'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) ainsi qu'en vertu du paragraphe 53(3), pour les m\u00eames messages, \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une double indemnisation. Je souscris \u00e0 cette opinion.\n[198] Dans Kyburz, lorsqu'il a \u00e9valu\u00e9 s'il conviendrait d'ordonner le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, le Tribunal a pris soin de ne pas tenir compte des messages qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s contraires \u00e0 l'article 14.1 de la Loi. Il a peut-\u00eatre fait cela afin d'\u00e9viter la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il y ait double indemnisation.\n[199] Toutefois, en l'esp\u00e8ce, il ne semble pas logique, afin de concevoir une r\u00e9paration, de diss\u00e9quer la s\u00e9rie de huit messages dans lesquels l'intim\u00e9 a express\u00e9ment fait mention du plaignant et a menac\u00e9 ce dernier. Les messages faisaient partie d'un comportement continu qui violait l'article 14.1 ainsi que le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. Ils ont manifestement \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de mesures que le plaignant a prises contre l'intim\u00e9, notamment en r\u00e9ponse au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Ils faisaient partie d'une lutte qui se d\u00e9roulait entre les deux hommes et devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans un contexte global.\n[200] J'ai accord\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) en rapport avec le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9 lorsqu'il a exerc\u00e9 ou menac\u00e9 d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant. Selon moi, il ne conviendrait pas d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 additionnelle en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) pour la m\u00eame s\u00e9rie de messages en rapport avec le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 du comportement de l'intim\u00e9. En effet, je ne crois pas que l'on puisse faire de distinction utile entre l'acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 lorsqu'il a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant et l'acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 lorsqu'il a express\u00e9ment fait mention du plaignant dans la m\u00eame s\u00e9rie de messages.\n[201] Dans Chopra c. Canada (P.G.) 2006 CF 9 (appel en instance : A-52-06), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un corollaire du principe du r\u00e9tablissement de la victime dans son \u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieur est que la victime ne devrait pas \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on excessive. Les indemnit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui sont accord\u00e9es ne devraient pas \u00eatre des indemnit\u00e9s irr\u00e9alistes ou des gains fortuits. Un tel r\u00e9sultat porterait atteinte \u00e0 l'objet de la Loi qui est fortement orient\u00e9 vers la justice sociale (Chopra, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 42).\n[202] Selon moi, accorder une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) pour l'acte qui a trait \u00e0 la m\u00eame s\u00e9rie de messages \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard duquel une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) aurait pour effet d'indemniser le plaignant de fa\u00e7on excessive.\n[203] Pour ces motifs, je refuse d'ordonner que l'intim\u00e9 verse une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b).\n(iii) La p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 [204] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) de la Loi permet au Tribunal d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 dans une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 13, lorsque cela est justifi\u00e9, de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire d'au plus 10 000 $. La Commission a demand\u00e9 que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de 10 000 $ car, selon elle, les messages en l'esp\u00e8ce comptent parmi les messages les plus d\u00e9prav\u00e9s et les plus haineux qu'elle a vus. En outre, une semaine avant que l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente cause ne commence, l'intim\u00e9 diffusait toujours des messages sur Internet.\n[205] L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Warman 2005 TCDP 36 apporte une certaine incertitude quant \u00e0 la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c). Bien que l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 ait mentionn\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 ne contestait pas la constitutionalit\u00e9 de la disposition, elle a pr\u00e9tendu que le Tribunal devrait tenir compte de l'incertitude constitutionnelle cr\u00e9\u00e9e par Warman c. Warman lorsqu'il d\u00e9cidera s'il doit ordonner le paiement d'une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9.\n[206] Je rejette cet argument. Une disposition l\u00e9gislative est valide tant qu'elle n'est pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9e invalide. Selon moi, l'incertitude constitutionnelle n'existe pas. Le Tribunal ne peut pas refuser d'appliquer la loi parce qu'il craint qu'elle puisse \u00eatre invalide. Il ne peut refuser d'appliquer la loi que lorsque celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e invalide, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve et des arguments, et apr\u00e8s que les procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux furent d\u00fbment avis\u00e9s. Cela n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en l'esp\u00e8ce. En outre, je souligne que dans Schnell, le Tribunal a conclu que les modifications \u00e0 la Loi par lesquelles on a ajout\u00e9 les dispositions relatives \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale aux r\u00e9parations d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues par la Loi ne rendaient pas l'article 13 inconstitutionnel.\n[207] Pour d\u00e9cider s'il ordonnera \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9, le Tribunal devra tenir compte des facteurs suivants qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article 54(1.1) par le l\u00e9gislateur :\n(1) La nature et la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que les circonstances l'entourant; (2) La nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte; (3) Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de son auteur; (4) La capacit\u00e9 de payer de l'auteur.\n[208] J'estime que les messages \u00e9taient d\u00e9prav\u00e9s et d\u00e9shumanisants. Selon moi, on peut conclure, en se fondant uniquement sur le libell\u00e9 des messages, que l'intim\u00e9 voulait exposer les membres des groupes cibles \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris et qu'il voulait rallier les gens \u00e0 ses opinions. L'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 l'expulsion forc\u00e9e des personnes qui ne sont pas de race blanche, il a menac\u00e9 de commettre des actes de violence contre les cibles de sa haine et il a appuy\u00e9 avec enthousiaste l'id\u00e9e d'une guerre sainte raciale au cours de laquelle tous les hommes qui n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 la race blanche p\u00e9riraient. Il a utilis\u00e9 des images photographiques particuli\u00e8rement horribles pour mobiliser ses lecteurs et pour diffuser ses messages de haine avec beaucoup plus de force.\n[209] L'intim\u00e9 a clairement diffus\u00e9 ses messages avec une indiff\u00e9rence d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e quant aux cons\u00e9quences possibles de ses actes. Il s'est servi d'Internet, un moyen de communication puissant et omnipr\u00e9sent dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, pour perp\u00e9trer ses actes. Toutefois, rien ne prouve que l'intim\u00e9 poss\u00e8de des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires.\n[210] L'intim\u00e9 a choisi de ne pas t\u00e9moigner dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne poss\u00e8de aucun renseignement quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de payer, si ce n'est un message dans lequel il d\u00e9clare qu'il est relativement ais\u00e9, qu'il occupe un emploi stable, qu'il a peu de d\u00e9penses, qu'ils payent sans difficult\u00e9s toutes ses factures en temps. Il se peut que l'intim\u00e9 ne soit plus relativement ais\u00e9. Toutefois, en l'absence de preuve de la part de l'intim\u00e9, je conclus qu'il n'y a aucune raison de r\u00e9duire la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 parce que celui-ci serait incapable de la payer.\n[211] Compte tenu de l'ensemble de ces facteurs, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de 6 000 $. Le paiement de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 devra \u00eatre fait par ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 ou par mandat poste \u00e0 l'ordre du Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, et doit \u00eatre re\u00e7u par le Tribunal dans les 120 jours suivant la date \u00e0 laquelle l'intim\u00e9 aura \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nKaren A.

Grant Sinclair\n[TRADUCTION]\n(i) La d\u00e9cision Ennis\n[1] Le plaignant, John Ennis, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte dat\u00e9e du 11 juillet 2002 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Il pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9e, la Premi\u00e8re nation de Tobique, a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, en contravention de l'article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) car elle a augment\u00e9 de 5 p. 100 les taux d'aide social de base, et ce, sans augmenter les taux d'assurance invalidit\u00e9 de base des membres de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Tobique.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal d'ordonner que l'article 67 de la LCDP s'applique, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la plainte.\n[3] Les taux d'aide sociale de base ont \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9s \u00e0 la suite d'une r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande dat\u00e9e du 23 mai 2000. L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que le versement de prestations d'aide sociale aux membres de la bande est autoris\u00e9 par les articles 66 et 69 de la Loi sur les Indiens. De plus, la bande doit verser des prestations d'aide sociale en conformit\u00e9 avec le First Nations Social Development Manual for Malisset at Tobique.\n[4] En vertu du paragraphe 66(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien, avec le consentement du conseil d'une bande, peut autoriser et ordonner la d\u00e9pense de sommes d'argent du compte de revenu \u00e0 toute fin qui, d'apr\u00e8s lui, favorisera le progr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et le bien-\u00eatre de la bande ou d'un de ses membres.\n[5] Le paragraphe 66(2) autorise le ministre \u00e0 d\u00e9penser l'argent du compte de revenu de la bande en vue d'aider les Indiens malades, invalides, \u00e2g\u00e9s ou indigents de la bande.\n[6] Le paragraphe 69(1) pr\u00e9voit que le gouverneur en conseil peut, par d\u00e9cret, permettre \u00e0 une bande de contr\u00f4ler, administrer et d\u00e9penser la totalit\u00e9 ou une partie de l'argent de son compte de revenu.\n[7] Dans sa requ\u00eate, l'intim\u00e9e affirme tout simplement que les articles 66 et 69 de la Loi sur les Indiens constituent le fondement juridique qui permet au conseil de bande de verser des prestations d'aide sociale.\n[8] L'intim\u00e9e n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve que le conseil de bande a consenti \u00e0 ces versements, ni que le ministre les a autoris\u00e9s ou ordonn\u00e9s comme l'exige l'article 66.\n[9] Le paragraphe 66(2) autorise le ministre, et non pas la bande, \u00e0 d\u00e9penser l'argent du compte de revenu de la bande.\n[10] L'intim\u00e9e n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve que, comme l'autorise l'article 69, le gouverneur en conseil a permis par d\u00e9cret \u00e0 la bande d'administrer l'argent de son compte de revenu.\n[11] L'article 67 de la LCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9 dans un certain nombre de causes. La premi\u00e8re cause est Desjarlais c. Piapot Band No. 75, [1989] 3 F.C. 605, 12 C.H.R.R. D\/466 (C.A.). Dans cette cause, une bande a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 son administratrice apr\u00e8s que le conseil de bande eut adopt\u00e9 une motion \u00e0 cet effet. La motion, d\u00e9crite comme un vote de non-confiance en la plaignante, \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur des plaintes relatives \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de la plaignante. La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission all\u00e9guant qu'elle avait fait l'objet d'une distinction illicite fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge.\n[12] En bout de ligne, la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, laquelle a rejet\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e que l'article 67 de la LCDP s'appliquait.\n[13] Lorsqu'elle a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l'article 67, la Cour a jug\u00e9 que les mots [. . .] or any provisions made under or pursuant to that Act (et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi) s'\u00e9tendent \u00e0 toutes les d\u00e9cisions prises par un conseil de bande en vertu d'un article pr\u00e9cis de la Loi sur les Indiens. La Cour a cependant conclu qu'un vote de non-confiance contre un employ\u00e9 de la bande n'\u00e9tait pas express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9 par la Loi sur les Indiens. L'article 67 ne s'appliquait donc pas.\n[14] La cause suivante dans la jurisprudence pertinente est Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (MAINC), (1995), 25 C.H.R.R. D\/386) (Prince). L'article 115 de la Loi sur les Indiens autorise le ministre des Affaires indiennes \u00e0 \u00e9laborer des politiques quant au financement permettant aux enfants autochtones de fr\u00e9quenter un pensionnat. Le ministre a adopt\u00e9 une politique exigeant que les enfants autochtones fr\u00e9quentent l'\u00e9cole la plus proche de leur r\u00e9sidence. La fille de la plaignante fr\u00e9quentait une \u00e9cole confessionnelle \u00e9loign\u00e9e de la maison et s'est vu refuser l'aide gouvernementale.\n[15] Le Tribunal s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 incomp\u00e9tent car il a jug\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de financement du ministre \u00e9tait une d\u00e9cision prise en vertu de l'article 115 de la Loi sur les Indiens, et que, donc, l'article 67 de la LCDP s'appliquait. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans le cadre d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, a souscrit \u00e0 l'opinion du Tribunal.\n[16] Dans la d\u00e9cision Bande indienne de Shubenacadie c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1998] 2 C.F. 198; conf. par (2000), 37 C.H.R.R. D\/466 (C.A.F.), un conjoint non indien, qui vivait sur une r\u00e9serve avec l'autorisation du conseil de bande, s'est vu refuser des prestations d'aide sociale. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral avait conclu un contrat avec la bande quant \u00e0 l'administration du programme d'aide sociale destin\u00e9 aux membres de la bande. Les lignes directrices quant \u00e0 l'administration de l'entente pr\u00e9voyaient express\u00e9ment qu'un conjoint non indien qui r\u00e9side l\u00e9galement sur la r\u00e9serve \u00e9tait admissible aux prestations.\n[17] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de l'affaire et elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision du conseil de bande de refuser de verser des prestations n'\u00e9tait pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l'article 67 de la LCDP. La Cour a soulign\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision du conseil de bande n'\u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur aucune disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[18] De plus, l'article 67 de la LCDP ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme exon\u00e9rant toutes les d\u00e9cisions du conseil de bande, mais plut\u00f4t comme n'exon\u00e9rant que les d\u00e9cisions autoris\u00e9es par la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[19] L'intim\u00e9e a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, laquelle a rejet\u00e9 l'appel. Dans ses motifs confirmant la d\u00e9cision du tribunal d'instance inf\u00e9rieure, la Cour d'appel a examin\u00e9 l'historique des ententes en mati\u00e8re d'aide sociale conclues entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les Premi\u00e8res nations.\n[20] La Cour a soulign\u00e9 que, en 1996, le l\u00e9gislateur a adopt\u00e9 le R\u00e9gime d'assistance publique au Canada (RAPC), lequel pr\u00e9voyait l'instauration de programmes du maintien du revenu et de partage des co\u00fbts entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les provinces. En vertu de la partie II du RAPC, le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien peut conclure des ententes de partage des co\u00fbts pour \u00e9tendre les prestations d'aide sociale provinciale aux Indiens r\u00e9sidant dans une r\u00e9serve. Jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant, aucune province n'a sign\u00e9 l'entente pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la partie II.\n[21] Hormis le RAPC, le l\u00e9gislateur n'a adopt\u00e9 aucune loi qui traite express\u00e9ment de la prestation de l'aide sociale aux Indiens r\u00e9sidant dans les r\u00e9serves. Toutefois, en 1964, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a instaur\u00e9 une politique qui autorise le MAINC \u00e0 fournir de l'aide social aux Premi\u00e8res nations. Il s'agit du fondement juridique des programmes d'aide sociale et il figure dans la D\u00e9lib\u00e9ration no 627879 du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e le 16 juillet 1964.\n[22] Dans ses motifs, la Cour a notamment renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un document intitul\u00e9 Background of the Development of the Social Assistance Program (Ce document figure \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'annexe 1 du First Nations Manual de l'intim\u00e9e).\n[23] Selon le document Background, la D\u00e9lib\u00e9ration no 627879 du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor autorisait le MAINC \u00e0 adopter les taux d'aide sociale provinciale et municipale ainsi que leurs modalit\u00e9s dans le cadre de l'administration des programmes d'aide sociale des Premi\u00e8res nations. Le document Background confirme qu'il n'existe aucune loi pr\u00e9cise qui traite des programmes d'aide sociale des Premi\u00e8res nations.\n[24] L'intim\u00e9e n'a soumis au Tribunal aucune entente ou aucun contrat conclu entre le MAINC et la Nation Maliseet \u00e0 Tobique quant au financement de son programme d'aide sociale (probablement que cette entente existe). Au lieu de cela, l'intim\u00e9e a soulign\u00e9 que le Tobique First Nations Development Manual autorise l'adoption de la motion du conseil de bande du 23 mai 2000. Selon moi, rien dans le Manual n'autorise le conseil de bande \u00e0 adopter une telle motion. Le Manual \u00e9num\u00e8re plut\u00f4t les lignes directrices et les proc\u00e9dures que doit suivre la bande pour administrer le programme de d\u00e9veloppement social. M\u00eame si elle peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant le fondement de la motion du 23 mai 2000, la motion n'est pas une disposition prise en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[25] Dans Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Conseil de la Bande Gordon, [2001] 1 C.F. 124 (C.A.), la plaignante, une Indienne inscrite qui vivait sur la r\u00e9serve de la bande de Gordon avec son \u00e9poux non indien, a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui attribue une nouvelle habitation sur la r\u00e9serve. Sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le conseil de bande. Elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission all\u00e9guant qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de son sexe et de son \u00e9tat matrimonial.\n[26] L'intim\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 l'article 67 de la LCDP et le Tribunal a conclu qu'il n'avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la cause. Le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision du conseil de bande de ne pas attribuer une habitation \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e9tait express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9e par l'article 20 de la Loi sur les Indiens. L'article 20 mentionne qu'un Indien n'est l\u00e9galement en possession d'une terre dans une r\u00e9serve que si, avec l'approbation du ministre, possession de la terre lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par le conseil de la bande.\n[27] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a souscris \u00e0 l'opinion du Tribunal. Dans ses motifs, la Cour a affirm\u00e9, \u00e0 l'instar du Tribunal, que l'article 67 de la LCDP doit s'interpr\u00e9ter restrictivement parce qu'il restreint l'\u00e9tendue de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour a invoqu\u00e9 l'arr\u00eat Zurich Insurance Company c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [1992] 2 R.C.S. 321, page 339, dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a accord\u00e9 au Code des droits de la personne de l'Ontario un statut quasi constitutionnel, de telle sorte que les exceptions \u00e0 une telle loi doivent s'interpr\u00e9ter restrictivement.\n[28] Essentiellement, la Cour a accept\u00e9 que l'article 20 conf\u00e8re non seulement le pouvoir d'attribuer une habitation, mais \u00e9galement, d'une fa\u00e7on n\u00e9cessairement implicite, le pouvoir de ne pas attribuer d'habitation.\n[29] Les deux causes les plus r\u00e9centes qui portent sur l'article 67 sont Bernard c. Conseil scolaire de Waycobah Board, (1999) 36 C.H.R.R. D\/51 (T.C.D.P.) et Bressette c. Conseil de Bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stoney Point (no 1) 2003 TCDP 41. Dans Bernard, la plaignante, une membre de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Waycobah, travaillait comme secr\u00e9taire dans une \u00e9cole. L'intim\u00e9 a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison de la mani\u00e8re dont elle s'\u00e9tait conduite \u00e0 deux ou trois occasions. Selon le Conseil scolaire, cette conduite avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par une d\u00e9ficience mentale. La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission une plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience.\n[30] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que l'article 114 de la Loi sur les Indiens, lequel autorise le ministre \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, diriger et entretenir des \u00e9coles pour les enfants indiens, autorisait le Conseil scolaire \u00e0 prendre la d\u00e9cision qu'il a prise.\n[31] Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 cet argument. Il a affirm\u00e9 que, bien que le paragraphe 114(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens autorisait le ministre \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, diriger et entretenir des \u00e9coles pour les enfants indiens, il \u00e9tait difficile d'\u00e9tablir un lien r\u00e9el entre ce paragraphe de la Loi sur les Indiens et la d\u00e9cision du conseil scolaire de Waycobah de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi de la plaignante.\n[32] Dans Bressette c. Conseil de Bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stoney Point, il \u00e9tait question d'un Indien inscrit membre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Kettle et Stoney Point qui a pos\u00e9 sa candidature, et ce, sans succ\u00e8s, pour le poste d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles. Celui-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne car il pr\u00e9tendait ne pas avoir obtenu le poste en raison de sa situation familiale.\n[33] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9e par les articles 69, 81 et 83 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Les articles 81 et 83 autorisent les conseils de bande \u00e0 prendre des r\u00e8glements pour les fins mentionn\u00e9es dans ces articles.\n[34] Toutefois, en derni\u00e8re analyse, l'intim\u00e9 a invoqu\u00e9 deux r\u00e8glements adopt\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, lesquels, en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, traitent de la gestion, du contr\u00f4le et de l'affectation des revenus des bandes.\n[35] Le Tribunal a conclu que la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9 comportait \u00e0 la fois un aspect de dotation en personnel et \u00e0 la fois un aspect financier. Mais l'objet principal de la d\u00e9cision du conseil de bande \u00e9tait de remplir le poste d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles. La Loi sur les Indiens ne comprend aucune disposition pr\u00e9cise qui traite de la dotation en personnel dans une bande. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'article 67 ne s'appliquait pas.\n[36] Selon moi, le m\u00eame raisonnement s'applique en l'esp\u00e8ce. La motion du conseil de bande du 23 mai 2000 \u00e9tait une d\u00e9cision qui avait trait \u00e0 l'allocation de fonds d'aide sociale aux membres de la bande qui vivent sur la r\u00e9serve. La d\u00e9pense de sommes d'argent du compte de revenu n'a fait que d\u00e9couler de cette d\u00e9cision.\nConclusion\n[37] Voici ce qui ressort de l'analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de de la Loi sur les Indiens, des d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal ainsi que des d\u00e9cisions de la Cour :\nL'article 67 de la LCDP doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite, car il constitue une exception aux lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne; L'objet pr\u00e9dominant de la motion du conseil de bande du 23 mai 2000 \u00e9tait le versement de prestations d'aide sociale aux membres de la bande vivant sur la r\u00e9serve; Rien dans la Loi sur les Indiens n'autorise un conseil de bande \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions en rapport avec la prestation d'aide sociale aux membres d'une bande qui vivent sur une r\u00e9serve. Le fondement juridique est la D\u00e9lib\u00e9ration no 627879 du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor; Parmi les causes portant sur l'application de l'article 67 de la LCDP, il n'y en a que deux o\u00f9 l'on a conclu que la d\u00e9cision du conseil de bande n'\u00e9tait pas soumise au contr\u00f4le en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Dans ces deux causes, la d\u00e9cision du conseil de bande \u00e9tait \u00e9tay\u00e9e par une disposition pr\u00e9cise de la Loi sur les Indiens; Dans les autres causes, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pu mentionner aucune disposition pr\u00e9cise de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9tayant la d\u00e9cision sur laquelle portait la plainte; Dans aucune des causes cit\u00e9es o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision du conseil de bande comportait la d\u00e9pense de sommes d'argent appartenant \u00e0 la bande, le Tribunal ou la Cour a conclu que la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e par les articles 66 ou 69 de la Loi sur les Indiens; En fait, sauf dans le cas de la d\u00e9cision Bressette, aucun intim\u00e9 n'a pr\u00e9tendu que ces d\u00e9cisions \u00e9taient ou pouvaient \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9es par les articles 66 ou 69; Rien ne prouve que les conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'exercice du pouvoir accord\u00e9 par les articles 66 et 69 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites; Les articles 66 et 69 sont d'ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et ils ne doivent pas l'emporter sur le contr\u00f4le en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, compte tenu de la directive judiciaire que l'article 67 de la LCDP doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re restrictive.\n[38] Pour l'ensemble de ces motifs, la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nJ.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Glenn Bahr en vue d'obtenir un ajournement de l'audience qui doit \u00eatre tenue dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u00e0 compter du 23 mai 2006. La plainte se rapporte \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles M. Bahr et le groupe Western Canada for Us ont fait de la propagande haineuse sur Internet, en contravention de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] M. Bahr a de plus fait l'objet d'une accusation suivant le paragraphe 319(2) du Code criminel, une disposition qui traite de l'acte qui consiste \u00e0 fomenter volontairement la haine. L'audience pr\u00e9liminaire quant \u00e0 cette accusation a commenc\u00e9 en janvier 2006 et doit reprendre en octobre 2006 \u00e0 Edmonton, en Alberta. Une interdiction de publication a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e dans l'instance \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[3] Le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Bahr pr\u00e9tend que si la pr\u00e9sente instruction n'est pas ajourn\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'une d\u00e9cision soit rendue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle contre M. Bahr, son droit d'obtenir un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable dans la poursuite au criminel sera enfreint. La publicit\u00e9 entourant les audiences du Tribunal portera un rude coup \u00e0 l'objectif vis\u00e9 par l'interdiction de publication dans l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle qui consiste \u00e0 s'assurer que les \u00e9ventuels jur\u00e9s ne feront pas preuve de partialit\u00e9 du fait de ce qu'ils auront lu dans les m\u00e9dias \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'affaire. De plus, le repr\u00e9sentant pr\u00e9tend que le t\u00e9moignage que M. Bahr pourrait rendre au cours de l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte pourrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 contre lui dans le proc\u00e8s au criminel.\n[4] De plus, il pr\u00e9tend qu'il sera enfreint au droit de M. Bahr d'obtenir une audience \u00e9quitable dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. M. Bahr a d'abord d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qu'il avait l'intention de t\u00e9moigner pour son propre compte. Il a par la suite modifi\u00e9 cet expos\u00e9 afin de mentionner que pour pr\u00e9server son droit de garder le silence, il n'avait aucun autre choix que de refuser de t\u00e9moigner au cours de l'instance en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, il affirme qu'il sera incapable de se d\u00e9fendre de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la plainte suivant l'article 13. Cela constitue, selon ce qu'il pr\u00e9tend, un manquement clair aux r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle.\n[5] Le plaignant, M. Richard Warman, pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal a le pouvoir, suivant le paragraphe 52(1) de la Loi, de rendre une ordonnance quant \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 lorsque cela est n\u00e9cessaire pour s'assurer que les objectifs vis\u00e9s par l'interdiction de publication prononc\u00e9e dans l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle ne sont pas mis en p\u00e9ril. De plus, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que M. Bahr n'est pas tenu de t\u00e9moigner ou de s'incriminer au cours de l'audition de la plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 13. Il est libre de choisir la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle il participera \u00e0 l'audience et l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus ne sera pas touch\u00e9e par son choix. Selon le plaignant, un ajournement de la pr\u00e9sente instance entra\u00eenerait un retard de l'audience pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Cela serait contraire \u00e0 l'objectif visant \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les plaintes sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la justice naturelle.\n[6] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne reprend les pr\u00e9tentions du plaignant et ajoute que M. Bahr n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures de protection qui peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour s'assurer que son droit d'obtenir un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable dans la poursuite au criminel et une audience \u00e9quitable devant le Tribunal seront insuffisantes ou inefficaces.\n[7] Dans la d\u00e9cision Baltruweit c. SCRS, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'a pas le pouvoir de surseoir \u00e0 sa propre instance (Baltruweit c. SCRS, 2004 TCDP 14, au paragraphe 12). Cependant, en tant que ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal a un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour accorder un ajournement. Dans l'exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, le Tribunal doit \u00e9tablir si un ajournement est n\u00e9cessaire afin de respecter les principes de justice naturelle (Baltruweit, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 17). Autrement dit, la question est celle de savoir s'il serait \u00e9quitable pour les parties de poursuivre l'audience comme cela \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu.\n[8] Il n'est aucunement inhabituel que les m\u00eames situations de fait donnent lieu \u00e0 une instance administrative devant un tribunal comme le Tribunal en l'esp\u00e8ce et \u00e0 une instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle ou quasi criminelle se rapportant aux m\u00eames parties et \u00e0 des questions de fait et de droit similaires. (Voir par exemple Seth c. Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration), [1993] 3 C.F. 348 (C.A.F.); Spagucci's Ltd. c. Alberta (Gaming Commission) (1997), 55 Alta. L.R. (3d) 173 (C.R. Alberta); et Willock c. British Columbia (Superintendant of Motor Vehicles), 2000 BCSC 772 (C.S. de C.-B.)). Souvent, dans des situations comme celle en l'esp\u00e8ce, une des parties exprimera la pr\u00e9occupation, comme M. Bahr a fait dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, qu'il sera port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 la protection contre l'auto-incrimination et \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 des instances si on permet que les deux instances aient lieu en m\u00eame temps.\n[9] La protection contre l'auto-incrimination ench\u00e2ss\u00e9e dans la Constitution est fond\u00e9e sur le principe selon lequel l'\u00c9tat n'est pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 mobiliser des individus contre eux-m\u00eames. L'\u00c9tat doit plut\u00f4t avoir l'obligation positive de prouver l'accusation en recourant \u00e0 d'autres sources ou seulement en obtenant la coop\u00e9ration \u00e9clair\u00e9e et volontaire de l'accus\u00e9 (Phillips et al. c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Commission d'enqu\u00eate sur la trag\u00e9die de la mine Westray), ([1995] 2 R.C.S. 97, au paragraphe 80). Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu'un accus\u00e9 est forc\u00e9 de t\u00e9moigner en dehors d'une cour de justice criminelle, le tribunal doit s'efforcer de cerner dans quelle mesure les principes mentionn\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre compromis par cet ordre de t\u00e9moigner.\n[10] Cependant, les cours ont clairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fait qu'un individu soit partie de fa\u00e7on simultan\u00e9e dans une instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle et dans une instance en mati\u00e8re civile ne compromet pas n\u00e9cessairement l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l'une ou l'autre des instances ou son droit \u00e0 la protection contre l'auto-incrimination (Phillips et al., pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 165). Pour cette raison, il ne suffit pas pour la partie qui demande un ajournement dans l'instance en mati\u00e8re civile de simplement all\u00e9guer que la simultan\u00e9it\u00e9 des instances portera atteinte au droit d'obtenir une audience \u00e9quitable et au droit \u00e0 la protection contre l'auto-incrimination. Plut\u00f4t, il appartient \u00e0 la partie qui demande l'ajournement de d\u00e9montrer ce qui suit : (1) l'instance en mati\u00e8re civile forcera la partie \u00e0 rompre son silence et (2) la contrainte \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner causera un pr\u00e9judice pr\u00e9cis, dont l'importance rend les circonstances si extraordinaires ou exceptionnelles qu'un ajournement est justifi\u00e9 (Nash c. Ontario (1995), 27 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A. de l'Ont.); C.B. c. Caughell (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 741 (Cour div. de l'Ont.); Spagucci, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 10; Seth c. Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 17 et 18).\n[11] Je ne vois aucune raison pour laquelle le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment ne devrait pas \u00eatre suivi dans le contexte de l'instance devant le Tribunal.\nI. L'audience du Tribunal contraindra-t-elle M. Bahr \u00e0 rompre son silence? [12] M. Bahr a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'a aucun autre choix que de refuser de t\u00e9moigner lors des audiences du Tribunal afin de pr\u00e9server son droit de garder le silence. Cependant, le droit de garder le silence et le droit \u00e0 la protection contre l'auto-incrimination sont menac\u00e9s seulement lorsqu'une personne est contrainte de divulguer des renseignements qui l'incriminent. Il n'est pas port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 ces droits dans le contexte d'une communication volontaire : (R. c. Van Haarlem (1991), 135 N.R. 379 (C.A. de C.-B.), \u00e0 la page 386; confirm\u00e9 par [1992] 1 R.C.S. 982.). Un individu est-il contraint de t\u00e9moigner dans le contexte d'une instance administrative lorsqu'il appert que c'est la seule fa\u00e7on de se d\u00e9fendre avec succ\u00e8s?\n[13] Les cours de justice ont fait une distinction entre des situations dans lesquelles un individu croit qu'il est strat\u00e9giquement n\u00e9cessaire pour lui de t\u00e9moigner et dans lesquelles un individu est contraint par la loi de t\u00e9moigner. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les cours de justice ont statu\u00e9 que lorsqu'un individu a le choix de se pr\u00e9senter lors d'une audience administrative pour fournir des renseignements et qu'il le fait afin de pr\u00e9senter des renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa cause, cela n'\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 \u00eatre contraint de donner des renseignements (voir par exemple : Spagucci's Ltd, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 8; Willock c. British Columbia (Superintendant of Motor Vehicles), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 14; White c. Nova Scotia (Registrar of Motor Vehicles) (1996), 20 M.V.R. (3d) 192 (C.S. de N.-\u00c9.), au paragraphe 35; d\u00e9cision contraire : Williams c. Superintendent of Insurance (N.-\u00c9.) (1993), 125 N.S.R. (2d) 323)). Ainsi, la jurisprudence donne \u00e0 penser que lorsqu'un individu n'est pas tenu par la loi de t\u00e9moigner dans le contexte d'une instance administrative, mais plut\u00f4t qu'il est en mesure de faire un choix \u00e9clair\u00e9 quant \u00e0 savoir s'il t\u00e9moignera, il n'est pas port\u00e9 atteinte au droit de garder le silence et au droit \u00e0 la protection contre l'auto-incrimination.\n[14] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, M. Bahr, m\u00eame s'il n'estime pas qu'il a le choix de t\u00e9moigner ou non lors de l'audience du Tribunal, a en fait un choix. La loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas que M. Bahr est tenu de t\u00e9moigner. En outre, il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie des services d'un conseiller juridique qui le repr\u00e9sente dans l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle et des services d'une personne qui l'assiste \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des questions pr\u00e9liminaires se rapportant \u00e0 l'instance devant le Tribunal. M. Bahr est, par cons\u00e9quent, en mesure de faire un choix \u00e9clair\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa participation \u00e0 l'instance devant le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne sera pas port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 son droit de garder le silence et \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la protection contre l'auto-incrimination du fait que le Tribunal instruit la plainte.\nII. M. Bahr s'est-il acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu'il existe dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire des circonstances extraordinaires qui justifient qu'un ajournement soit accord\u00e9? [15] Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration) c. Lundgren, [1993] 1 C.F. 187 (1re inst.), au paragraphe 14, M. le juge Dub\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : Je ne connais pas de principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au Canada \u00e0 l'effet que l'existence de proc\u00e9dures civiles et criminelles en cour en m\u00eame temps impliquant les m\u00eames personnes et les m\u00eames faits constitue automatiquement un motif valable justifiant l'ajournement des proc\u00e9dures au civil. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que seules des circonstances extraordinaires, alors que les proc\u00e9dures civiles pourraient causer un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de l'accus\u00e9 au criminel, justifieraient l'ajournement de la proc\u00e9dure civile.\n[16] Il appartient \u00e0 la partie qui demande l'ajournement d'\u00e9tablir de fa\u00e7on concluante l'existence d'un tel pr\u00e9judice; une simple all\u00e9gation ne sera pas suffisante. De plus, m\u00eame l'\u00e9ventuelle communication lors de l'instance en mati\u00e8re civile de la nature de la d\u00e9fense de l'accus\u00e9 ou d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve constituant de l'auto-incrimination ne constitue pas n\u00e9cessairement des circonstances extraordinaires justifiant l'ajournement de l'instance en mati\u00e8re civile (Nash, Falloncrest Financial Corporation et al c. Ontario (1995), 27 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A. de l'Ont.).\n[17] Pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s expos\u00e9s, j'estime que M. Bahr n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'il existe dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire des circonstances extraordinaires qui justifient l'ajournement de l'instance devant le Tribunal.\n[18] Comme je l'ai pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment d\u00e9clar\u00e9, M. Bahr a le choix de t\u00e9moigner ou non lors de l'audience du Tribunal. S'il choisit de t\u00e9moigner, il existe en droit de nombreuses mesures de protection qui peuvent tr\u00e8s bien \u00eatre \u00e0 sa disposition lors de l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle afin de s'assurer que son droit d'obtenir une audience \u00e9quitable et son droit \u00e0 la protection contre l'auto-incrimination soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Si M. Bahr se trouve dans une situation dans laquelle o\u00f9, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de t\u00e9moigner lors de l'audience du Tribunal, on lui pose une question qui peut \u00e9ventuellement l'incriminer, il peut tr\u00e8s bien invoquer la protection de l'article 13 de la Charte et du paragraphe 5(2) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada lors de l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle.\n[19] L'article 5 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada permet \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin de s'opposer \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une question s'il croit que la r\u00e9ponse pourrait tendre \u00e0 l'incriminer. Le t\u00e9moin sera quand m\u00eame tenu de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question, mais sa r\u00e9ponse qui pourrait potentiellement l'incriminer est en retour prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la loi qui interdit l'utilisation des r\u00e9ponses dans toute autre proc\u00e9dure exerc\u00e9e contre le t\u00e9moin (R. c. No\u00ebl, 2002 CSC 67, au paragraphe 25).\n[20] L'article 13 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s prot\u00e8ge \u00e9galement un t\u00e9moin contre l'utilisation d'un t\u00e9moignage incriminant dans une autre proc\u00e9dure exerc\u00e9e contre lui. Suivant l'article 13, contrairement \u00e0 la situation qui existe suivant l'article 5 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, le t\u00e9moin n'a pas \u00e0 s'opposer au moment o\u00f9 il donne le t\u00e9moignage initial. La protection est automatiquement accord\u00e9e \u00e0 un accus\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si le t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait - ou si on croyait qu'il l'\u00e9tait - de nature incriminante au moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 (R. c. No\u00ebl, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 32).\n[21] La protection pr\u00e9vue par l'article 13 de la Charte et le paragraphe 5(2) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada est \u00e0 la disposition d'un t\u00e9moin qu'il choisisse de t\u00e9moigner ou qu'il soit contraint de le faire (R. c. No\u00ebl, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 25). Il appartient \u00e9videmment au tribunal p\u00e9nal de trancher la question de savoir si un t\u00e9moignage donn\u00e9 au cours d'une instance devant le Tribunal devrait \u00eatre exclu compte tenu de l'article 13 de la Charte ou du paragraphe 5(2) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada. M. Bahr n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 pourquoi ces protections seraient insuffisantes ou inappropri\u00e9es.\n[22] M. Bahr a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que le fait de continuer l'instruction du Tribunal portera un rude coup \u00e0 l'interdiction de publication ordonn\u00e9e dans l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'instance du Tribunal occasionnera la publicit\u00e9 que l'interdiction de publication vise \u00e0 \u00e9liminer. Compte tenu de la similarit\u00e9 de la nature des infractions au Code criminel et \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9es, il pr\u00e9tend que la publicit\u00e9 entourant l'instance devant le Tribunal peut tr\u00e8s bien menacer l'impartialit\u00e9 d'\u00e9ventuels jur\u00e9s lors de son proc\u00e8s au criminel. Cela, \u00e0 son tour, menacera le droit de M. Bahr d'obtenir un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable dans la poursuite au criminel.\n[23] Il y a de nombreuses r\u00e9ponses aux pr\u00e9tentions pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9es. Tout d'abord, les pr\u00e9tentions de M. Bahr sont pour le moment des hypoth\u00e8ses. La question de savoir si M. Bahr t\u00e9moignera lors de l'audience du Tribunal et celle de savoir s'il choisira d'\u00eatre entendu par un juge et un jury \u00e0 son proc\u00e8s au criminel ne sont pas des questions claires. Nous ne savons pas non plus quelle sera la nature de la publicit\u00e9 entourant l'instance devant le Tribunal. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment cette sorte d'incertitude que les juges de la Cour supr\u00eame qui formaient les juges minoritaires dans l'arr\u00eat Phillips ont estim\u00e9 \u00eatre insuffisante pour justifier que soit tir\u00e9e une conclusion selon laquelle le droit de tous les accus\u00e9s d'obtenir un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable dans cette affaire \u00e9tait compromis.\n[24] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne conf\u00e8re le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance d'interdiction de publication ou une ordonnance quant \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es. L'alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut prendre toute mesure et rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l'instruction s'il est convaincu qu'il existe un risque s\u00e9rieux que la divulgation de questions portera atteinte \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es et que cela l'emporte sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l'instruction soit publique. L'alin\u00e9a 52(1)d) permet que soient rendues des ordonnance quant \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 s'il y a une possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger. Le Tribunal a rendu une ordonnance d'interdiction de publication suivant l'article 52 de la Loi dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es : Day c. MDN et M. Hortie, 2003 TCDP 12.\n[25] M. Bahr, par son repr\u00e9sentant, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'opposerait vivement \u00e0 une interdiction de publication dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que le public au Canada ne devrait pas \u00eatre priv\u00e9 de l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des renseignements se rapportant \u00e0 d'\u00e9ventuelles restrictions \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression par l'utilisation du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. Bien que cela ne ressorte pas clairement des pr\u00e9tentions de la Commission, il semblerait que la Commission sugg\u00e8re que soit prononc\u00e9e une interdiction de publication dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Ce point n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement d\u00e9battu. Par cons\u00e9quent, je laisse aux parties le soin de d\u00e9cider si elles doivent demander une ordonnance suivant le paragraphe 52(1) de la Loi. Il suffit aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision de mentionner que, si c'\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de le faire, le Tribunal a le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance quant \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 qui pourrait inclure une interdiction de publication.\n[26] Dans Seth, M. le juge D\u00e9cary a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces circonstances extraordinaires ou exceptionnelles qui justifieraient de suspendre l'instance en mati\u00e8re civile incluraient des situations dans lesquelles il \u00e9tait clair que l'instance en mati\u00e8re civile n'avait pas d'autre objet que de r\u00e9unir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l'appui d'une accusation ou de faciliter l'engagement de poursuites criminelles contre le t\u00e9moin. Lorsque l'instance est si d\u00e9pourvue de toute fin publique l\u00e9gitime et si d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment con\u00e7ue pour faciliter l'engagement de poursuites contre le t\u00e9moin qu'il serait injuste de permettre qu'elle continue, alors l'ajournement serait clairement justifi\u00e9 (Seth, supra, au paragraphe 18).\n[27] Ce n'est clairement pas le cas dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. L'article 2 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00e9tablit la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9limination de la discrimination. Suivant l'article 48.9 de la Loi, le Tribunal a le mandat d'instruire les plaintes de discrimination sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. L'objet de l'audience, qui doit commencer le 23 mai 2006, est d'ex\u00e9cuter le mandat du Tribunal pr\u00e9vu par la loi. Le mandat n'est pas con\u00e7u de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 faciliter les poursuites contre M. Bahr.\n[28] En outre, la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce n'est pas une affaire comme l'affaire Pearson c. R, [1999] A.C.F. no 1298 (Q.L.), dans laquelle la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision par laquelle un protonotaire a prononc\u00e9 un sursis dans une affaire civile alors qu'il y avait en cours une instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle. Le plaignant dans cette affaire \u00e9tait l'accus\u00e9 dans le proc\u00e8s au criminel. La proc\u00e9dure civile se rapportait \u00e0 des dommages que le plaignant r\u00e9clamait \u00e0 la Couronne qui l'aurait soi-disant priv\u00e9 d'un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable dans l'affaire criminelle. La Couronne demandait une suspension de l'instance en mati\u00e8re civile en all\u00e9guant que la question de savoir si le proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait \u00e9quitable avait d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant la cour criminelle et devrait, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e devant cette cour. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a souscrit \u00e0 cette opinion et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la proc\u00e9dure civile \u00e9tait essentiellement la r\u00e9ciproque des moyens de d\u00e9fense invoqu\u00e9s par le plaignant dans la poursuite au criminel.\n[29] Ce n'est pas le cas dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne n'est clairement pas une proc\u00e9dure contre la Couronne et elle n'est pas non plus la r\u00e9ciproque des moyens de d\u00e9fense invoqu\u00e9s par M. Bahr dans l'affaire en mati\u00e8re criminelle. En outre, m\u00eame s'il se peut que l'instance devant le Tribunal et celle en mati\u00e8re criminelle se rapportent \u00e0 des questions de fait similaires, il n'y a pas de lien de droit entre les deux instances. Dans l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle, la Couronne est tenue de prouver, hors de tout doute raisonnable, que M. Bahr a foment\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment et publiquement la haine contre un groupe identifiable. Dans l'instance devant le Tribunal, il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, que M. Bahr et le groupe Western Canada for Us a expos\u00e9 \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction. Il s'agit l\u00e0 de questions de droit tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes qui doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es selon des crit\u00e8res de preuve diff\u00e9rents. En outre, la preuve dans l'un des cas ne conduit pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 la preuve dans l'autre cas. Par exemple, un acquittement dans une instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle ne conduirait pas n\u00e9cessairement au succ\u00e8s des moyens de d\u00e9fense invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 13. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, une conclusion selon laquelle le bien-fond\u00e9 d'une plainte suivant l'article 13 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli ne conduirait pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 dans l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle. Finalement, \u00e0 l'exception de M. Bahr, les parties dans les deux instances ne sont pas les m\u00eames. Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, je suis d'avis que l'affaire Pearson n'est pas applicable dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances.\n[30] M. Bahr a exprim\u00e9 une pr\u00e9occupation du fait que l'enqu\u00eateur principal de la police dans l'affaire en mati\u00e8re criminelle sera pr\u00e9sent lors de l'audience du Tribunal et t\u00e9moignera pour la Commission et le plaignant. La pr\u00e9sence de cet individu lors de l'audience peut servir \u00e0 renforcer la cause de la Couronne contre M. Bahr. Cette situation, selon ce que M. Bahr insinue, constitue une circonstance exceptionnelle qui justifie un ajournement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'instance.\n[31] Je ne peux souscrire \u00e0 cette opinion. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses instances dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es. Le Tribunal peut en outre ordonner que les t\u00e9moins soient exclus de l'audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, les pr\u00e9occupations de M. Bahr \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sence de t\u00e9moins qui pourraient entendre son t\u00e9moignage pourraient \u00eatre apais\u00e9es par l'exercice ad\u00e9quat des pouvoirs que la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal.\n[32] Finalement, il faut noter que la demande de M. Bahr est essentiellement une demande visant \u00e0 obtenir un ajournement de l'instance devant le Tribunal pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'on ne sait pas quand l'affaire criminelle sera en fin de compte tranch\u00e9e. En outre, comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9, l'issue du proc\u00e8s au criminel ne sera pas n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9terminante quant \u00e0 l'issue de l'instance devant le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, apr\u00e8s ce qui pourrait \u00eatre un long d\u00e9lai pour finalement trancher l'affaire en mati\u00e8re criminelle, les parties seraient ensuite expos\u00e9es \u00e0 la perspective de pr\u00e9senter et de d\u00e9fendre une affaire potentiellement de nombreuses ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s qu'ait eu lieu la pr\u00e9tendue violation de la Loi. Non seulement cette situation irait \u00e0 l'encontre de l'objet consistant \u00e0 r\u00e9gler de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive la plainte, mais de plus il ne serait dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat d'aucune des parties de retarder la r\u00e9solution de la pr\u00e9sente affaire pendant une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nIII. Conclusion : Le fait de poursuivre l'audience \u00e0 la date pr\u00e9vue ne portera pas atteinte aux principes de justice naturelle [33] Pour les motifs suivants, je conclus que le fait de poursuivre l'audience du Tribunal \u00e0 la date pr\u00e9vue ne portera pas atteinte aux principes de justice naturelle :\nM. Bahr est en mesure de faire un choix \u00e9clair\u00e9 quant \u00e0 savoir s'il t\u00e9moignera ou non au cours de l'audience du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte suivant l'article 13 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui. Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait de poursuivre l'audience du Tribunal ne portera pas atteinte \u00e0 son droit de garder le silence et \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la protection contre l'auto-incrimination. S'il choisit de t\u00e9moigner, il peut invoquer la protection de l'article 13 de la Charte et le paragraphe 5(2) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada dans l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle subs\u00e9quente. L'une ou l'autre des parties peut demander au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance suivant l'article 52 de la Loi afin d'assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l'audience. Une demande peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e afin que les t\u00e9moins soient exclus de l'audience. L'objet de l'audience du Tribunal est de fournir de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive la r\u00e9solution de la plainte suivant l'article 13 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Bahr et le groupe Western Canada for Us. Rien n'indique que l'objet de la pr\u00e9sente instance consiste \u00e0 recueillir de M. Bahr des renseignements en vue d'obtenir une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 dans l'instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle. Les instances n'ont entre elles aucun lien faisant en sorte qu'il serait logique d'ajourner une des instances jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'autre soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. M. Bahr n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'il existe dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire des circonstances extraordinaires au point qu'un ajournement de l'instance soit n\u00e9cessaire.\n[34] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Bahr en vue d'obtenir un ajournement de l'instruction du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte suivant l'article 13 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Bahr et le groupe Western Canada for Us est rejet\u00e9e.\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision concernant une requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 deux plaintes qui doivent \u00eatre entendues ensemble le 23 mai 2006. Les intim\u00e9s, M. Glenn Bahr et Western Canada for Us (WCFU), ont demand\u00e9 que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Western Canada for Us (WCFU) soit rejet\u00e9e. Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans les deux plaintes que WCFU et Glenn Bahr ont diffus\u00e9 des messages haineux sur Internet, et ce, en contravention de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[2] Par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son repr\u00e9sentant, M. Bahr a pr\u00e9tendu que WCFU n'est ni un \u00eatre humain vivant, ni une soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il s'agit d'un site Internet. Il a de plus pr\u00e9tendu que, selon la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation, un intim\u00e9 dans une instance fond\u00e9e sur l'article 13 de la Loi doit \u00eatre, soit un \u00eatre humain, soit une soci\u00e9t\u00e9. \u00c0 l'appui de sa requ\u00eate, le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Bahr a produit le rapport d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne qui semble indiquer que l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission a cru que WCFU \u00e9tait le site Web qui se trouve \u00e0 l'adresse Internet suivante : www.westerncanadaforus.com.\n[3] Le plaignant, M. Richard Warman, a pr\u00e9tendu que le fait que l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission ait identifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tort l'intim\u00e9 WCFU comme \u00e9tant un site Web, n'a aucune importance \u00e0 ce stade-ci des proc\u00e9dures. En cas de diff\u00e9rends relatifs \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de la Commission, le recours appropri\u00e9 est le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[4] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Warman c. Guille et Canadian Heritage Alliance 2006 TCDP 12, s'applique en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans Warman c. Guille et Canadian Heritage Alliance, j'ai affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [...] la question de savoir si l'organisme Canadian Heritage Alliance est un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord pour communiquer les messages contest\u00e9s sera trait\u00e9e plus ad\u00e9quatement lorsque l'audience \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte aura \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue. \u00c0 ce moment, le Tribunal aura l'avantage d'avoir \u00e0 sa disposition un dossier de preuve complet sur lequel il pourra fonder sa d\u00e9cision.\n[5] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 13 de la Loi contre des groupes de personnes non dot\u00e9s de la personnalit\u00e9 morale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es car un certain nombre ou un ensemble d'indices pr\u00e9cis permettant de les identifier comme groupe \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents.\n[6] L'intitul\u00e9 figurant sur le formulaire de plainte ainsi que sur la lettre de renvoi de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne indique que c'est contre M. Glenn Bahr et Western Canada for Us que les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es, et non pas contre M. Glenn Bahr et www.westerncanadaforus.com. La question de savoir si Western Canada for Us est un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord pour diffuser des messages sur Internet au sens du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e. Pour les motifs que j'ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Warman c. Guille, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision qui doit \u00eatre prise sur le fondement d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve appropri\u00e9s. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve vers\u00e9s au dossier jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent ne permettent pas de prendre une telle d\u00e9cision.\n[7] Bien que l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Western Canada for Us est un site Web, M. Bahr, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, d\u00e9crit Western Canada for Us comme \u00e9tant [Traduction] un groupe ayant ses assises en Alberta et faisant la promotion de la r\u00e9forme de l'immigration et de la libert\u00e9 de parole. Selon l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Bahr, Western Canada for Us a organis\u00e9 des r\u00e9unions et des manifestations. Par cons\u00e9quent, il semble qu'on ne s'entende pas quant \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 de Western Canada for Us et quant \u00e0 la nature des activit\u00e9s auxquelles cet organisme a particip\u00e9. Le moment opportun pour r\u00e9gler ces questions est durant l'audience car on peut faire t\u00e9moigner sous serment et contre-interroger.\n[8] Par cons\u00e9quent, le rejet de la plainte contre Western Canada for Us demand\u00e9 par M. Bahr est rejet\u00e9 sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son droit de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau sa demande lors de l'audience sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte.\nKaren A.

Les d\u00e9pens\nG. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats\nH. La d\u00e9claration de comp\u00e9tence par le Tribunal\n[1] Le plaignant, Jean-Raymond Audet, pr\u00e9tend que son employeur, la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (CN), a refus\u00e9 de continuer de l'employer et ne lui a pas fourni de mesures d'accommodement apr\u00e8s qu'il eut subi une crise \u00e9pileptique le 10 septembre 2002. Il soutient que le CN a par cons\u00e9quent exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 son endroit du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] M. Audet et le CN ont particip\u00e9 tous deux \u00e0 l'audience et ils \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par des avocats. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience, la Commission a conclu avec les autres parties une entente portant sur les [traduction] questions de politiques en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire quant \u00e0 l'application des lignes directrices m\u00e9dicales de l'Association des chemins de fer du Canada. Les d\u00e9tails de l'entente n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s au Tribunal.\n[3] Pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, j'ai conclu que le CN a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Audet en refusant dans les faits de continuer de l'employer, en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, sans un motif justifiable suivant la Loi, et que la plainte de M. Audet est par cons\u00e9quent fond\u00e9e.\nI. LES FAITS AYANT DONN\u00c9 LIEU \u00c0 LA PLAINTE DE M. AUDET A. Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail de M. Audet au CN [4] M. Audet est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 47 ans et il r\u00e9side \u00e0 Sudbury. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au CN en mai 1988. En juillet 1989, M. Audet travaillait \u00e0 titre de serre-frein, en poste au terminal du CN \u00e0 Capreol, tout pr\u00e8s de Sudbury. Une \u00e9quipe de train typique de trois personnes se compose du conducteur de locomotive, du chef de train et du serre-frein qui assiste le chef de train. Les t\u00e2ches du serre-frein incluent l'aiguillage des voies ferr\u00e9es pour le d\u00e9placement des wagons d'un train et l'aide au triage des divers wagons.\n[5] En ao\u00fbt 1989, M. Audet a eu une crise convulsive \u00e0 une seule reprise alors qu'il \u00e9tait au travail. Il a re\u00e7u un diagnostic d'\u00e9pilepsie partielle complexe, \u00e9galement connue sous le nom d'\u00e9pilepsie du lobe temporale. En raison de cette crise, M. Audet prend des m\u00e9dicaments contre les convulsions depuis ce moment.\n[6] \u00c0 la suite de la crise convulsive, le CN a relev\u00e9 M. Audet de ses fonctions. M. Audet a re\u00e7u des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 court terme, puis des prestations d'assurance-emploi pendant qu'il \u00e9tait sans emploi. En 1992, le CN a r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 M. Audet au travail dans un poste de triage au terminal MacMillan du CN \u00e0 Toronto.\n[7] En 1995, M. Audet s'est bless\u00e9 au dos alors qu'il \u00e9tait au travail. Il a re\u00e7u des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 de temps en temps \u00e0 des travaux l\u00e9gers. En raison de sa blessure, la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l'assurance contre les accidents de travail (CSPAAT) de l'Ontario a impos\u00e9 plusieurs restrictions de travail, et a notamment exig\u00e9 qu'il ne travaille pas pendant des p\u00e9riodes prolong\u00e9es, qu'il l\u00e8ve le moins possible des objets lourds et qu'il \u00e9vite des mouvements r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs du dos.\n[8] En 1997, le m\u00e9decin chef du CN a \u00e9tabli certaines restrictions se rapportant \u00e0 l'\u00e9pilepsie de M. Audet qui devaient \u00eatre respect\u00e9es pour qu'il puisse reprendre un travail de serre-frein sur la voie ferr\u00e9e principale. Le m\u00e9decin chef a fait remarquer que M. Audet n'avait pas eu de crise convulsive depuis plus de cinq ans et il a conclu que la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il subisse de nouveau des crises convulsives \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t mince. Les restrictions pr\u00e9voyaient que M. Audet ne devait pas travailler seul et qu'il devait toujours avoir un contact visuel ou un contact par radio avec un membre de l'\u00e9quipe. Les membres de son \u00e9quipe devaient \u00eatre inform\u00e9s de la faible possibilit\u00e9 qu'il subisse soudainement une d\u00e9faillance. Toutes les r\u00e8gles se rapportant aux p\u00e9riodes de repos devaient \u00eatre strictement respect\u00e9es. M. Audet ne pouvait pas faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, sauf en cas d'urgence.\nB. La crise convulsive subie par M. Audet le 10 septembre 2002 [9] Compte tenu de la lettre du m\u00e9decin chef qui \u00e9non\u00e7ait les restrictions applicables \u00e0 M. Audet, ce dernier a pu reprendre le travail \u00e0 titre de serre-frein en poste \u00e0 Capreol, en 1998. Sur certains trains, lorsque les \u00e9quipes n'\u00e9taient compos\u00e9es que de deux personnes, il travaillait en tant que chef de train, un poste pour lequel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 en 1992.\n[10] Compte tenu de son rang relativement peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 sur la liste d'anciennet\u00e9 des serre-freins et des chefs de train du CN en poste \u00e0 Capreol, M. Audet a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 sur le tableau de remplacement. Par cons\u00e9quent, on l'appelait pour pourvoir des postes lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 permanent \u00e9tait absent ou lorsque aucun des employ\u00e9s permanents n'avait choisi de travailler sur un quart de travail donn\u00e9. Ainsi, lorsque le CN avait besoin des services d'un serre-frein ou d'un chef de train pour un trajet, M. Audet et les autres employ\u00e9s figurant sur le tableau de remplacement recevaient par rotation un appel et \u00e9taient invit\u00e9s \u00e0 effectuer le trajet. M. Audet \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 selon le nombre d'heures travaill\u00e9es ou selon les milles parcourus, d\u00e9pendamment des circonstances.\n[11] M. Audet pr\u00e9tend que dans l'ensemble il n'y avait pas suffisamment de personnel \u00e0 Capreol en 2002, de sorte qu'on lui a demand\u00e9 de travailler un nombre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'heures que jamais auparavant. Il soutient que la charge de travail l'a mis \u00e0 rude \u00e9preuve et qu'\u00e0 la fin de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 il \u00e9tait passablement fatigu\u00e9.\n[12] Le matin du 10 septembre 2002, il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 Capreol apr\u00e8s avoir particip\u00e9 au cours de la nuit au retour d'un train en provenance de Hornepayne, en Ontario. Il est mont\u00e9 dans son v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 la fin de son quart de travail et il se dirigeait chez lui pour se reposer. Il s'\u00e9tait inscrit en repos pour 24 heures. En se rendant \u00e0 la maison, il a senti ce qu'il d\u00e9crit \u00eatre comme une aura et il a imm\u00e9diatement constat\u00e9 qu'une crise convulsive \u00e9tait imminente. Il a rang\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la route. Il a eu une crise convulsive, mais il ne s'en souvient pas. Il se rappelle s'\u00eatre r\u00e9veill\u00e9 dans une ambulance. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduit \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, mais il a obtenu son cong\u00e9 plusieurs heures plus tard.\n[13] M. Audet s'est rendu chez lui. Il n'a pas inform\u00e9 le CN de l'incident. Au cours de la soir\u00e9e du lendemain, le 11 septembre 2002, le r\u00e9partiteur du CN lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour qu'il se pr\u00e9sente au travail pour effectuer un trajet disponible, comme c'\u00e9tait la pratique habituelle. M. Audet a demand\u00e9, en pr\u00e9tendant qu'il ne se sentait pas bien, s'il pouvait \u00eatre exempt\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter au travail. Le r\u00e9partiteur a r\u00e9pondu que sans une note d'un m\u00e9decin son absence ne pourrait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un cong\u00e9 de maladie. M. Audet a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas une telle note en sa possession, il estimait qu'il n'avait aucun autre choix que de se pr\u00e9senter au travail comme on lui demandait de le faire. Il a fait son trajet de train cette nuit-l\u00e0 et il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 Capreol le lendemain, le 12 septembre 2002.\n[14] Le superviseur de M. Audet, Gerald Nadon, qui occupait le poste de coordinateur de trains, a confirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le CN consid\u00e9rait [traduction] d\u00e9favorablement toute demande de cong\u00e9 de maladie faite \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute au r\u00e9partiteur par des employ\u00e9s auxquels on demandait de se pr\u00e9senter au travail. Le coordinateur de trains de l'employ\u00e9 menait habituellement par la suite une enqu\u00eate afin de savoir pourquoi l'employ\u00e9 avait dit \u00eatre malade. Le CN s'attend \u00e0 ce que les employ\u00e9s l'informent le plus t\u00f4t possible du fait qu'ils ne sont pas disponibles pour travailler en raison de maladie. Des notifications faites tardivement entra\u00eenent des probl\u00e8mes de logistique pour le CN et causent ensuite des retards de trains.\n[15] Pendant que M. Audet faisait son trajet de nuit, M. Nadon a entendu parler de la crise convulsive que M. Audet avait eue par les employ\u00e9s du CN \u00e0 Capreol. M. Nadon a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Audet de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 son bureau d\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 Capreol. Lorsque M. Nadon lui a demand\u00e9 directement si la rumeur \u00e9tait vraie, M. Audet a confirm\u00e9 qu'il avait effectivement eu une crise convulsive. M. Audet a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors de l'audience qu'il avait l'intention d'informer le CN du fait qu'il avait eu une crise convulsive, mais qu'il voulait le faire seulement apr\u00e8s avoir d'abord eu la possibilit\u00e9 de subir un examen par son m\u00e9decin de famille et son neurologue.\nC. Le CN rel\u00e8ve M. Audet de ses fonctions [16] M. Nadon a inform\u00e9 les services de sant\u00e9 au travail du CN (OHS) de la crise convulsive de M. Audet. La t\u00e2che des services de sant\u00e9 au travail du CN consiste \u00e0 \u00e9tablir et \u00e0 suivre toutes les politiques en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et d'aptitude au travail. L'aspect m\u00e9dical des fonctions des services de sant\u00e9 au travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 une entreprise ext\u00e9rieure, Medisys. Les renseignements fournis par M. Nadon ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s par l'\u00e9quipe de professionnels de la sant\u00e9 de Medisys qui \u00e0 son tour a envoy\u00e9 un message au bureau de la gestion des \u00e9quipes par lequel il lui enjoignait de relever imm\u00e9diatement M. Audet de ses fonctions et de ne pas l'affecter \u00e0 du travail sur d'autres trajets, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme inapte \u00e0 occuper son poste.\n[17] La d\u00e9cision de Medisys \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur les Lignes directrices m\u00e9dicales relatives \u00e0 l'emploi dans un poste classifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire d'un individu souffrant d'\u00e9pilepsie ou d'une autre forme de crise convulsive adopt\u00e9es par l'Association des chemins de fer du Canada (les lignes directrices de l'ACFC). Selon le R\u00e8glement concernant les postes essentiels \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire de Transport Canada, \u00e9labor\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 20 de la Loi sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire, L.R. 1985, ch. 32 (4e suppl.), un poste essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est d\u00e9fini comme un poste directement reli\u00e9 \u00e0 la marche des trains sur une voie principale ou dans le service de manoeuvre, ou un poste reli\u00e9 au contr\u00f4le de la circulation ferroviaire. Le CN consid\u00e8re que les serre-freins et les chefs de train font partie de cette cat\u00e9gorie.\n[18] Le R\u00e8glement m\u00e9dical des chemins de fer pour les employ\u00e9s occupant des postes classifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire (le R\u00e8glement m\u00e9dical des chemins de fer), \u00e9galement \u00e9labor\u00e9 par Transport Canada en vertu de l'article 20 de la Loi sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire, exige que les employeurs \u00e9valuent l'aptitude m\u00e9dicale au travail des personnes qui occupent des postes classifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire. Le m\u00e9decin chef d'une compagnie ferroviaire peut, s'il estime lors d'une \u00e9valuation individuelle de l'aptitude m\u00e9dicale au travail qu'une personne constitue une menace \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'exploitation ferroviaire, interdire \u00e0 cette personne d'occuper un poste classifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire ou la soumettre \u00e0 d'autres restrictions lui interdisant d'accomplir certaines t\u00e2ches des postes classifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire (r\u00e8gle 6.1).\n[19] Les lignes directrices de l'ACFC r\u00e9affirment le principe auquel souscrit le R\u00e8glement m\u00e9dical des chemins de fer de Transport Canada selon lequel les employ\u00e9s qui occupent des postes classifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire doivent poss\u00e9der les aptitudes physiques et mentales pour r\u00e9pondre aux exigences de leur t\u00e2che. Elles soulignent le fait que toute perturbation au niveau du rendement attribuable \u00e0 un trouble m\u00e9dical pourrait menacer la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s et de la population, et causer des dommages aux biens et \u00e0 l'environnement. La section 4 des lignes directrices de l'ACFC \u00e9nonce une s\u00e9rie de crit\u00e8res \u00e0 prendre en compte lors de l'\u00e9valuation de l'aptitude m\u00e9dicale au travail. Dans le cas d'une personne qui a re\u00e7u un diagnostic d'\u00e9pilepsie qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e avec des m\u00e9dicaments contre l'\u00e9pilepsie, les crit\u00e8res pr\u00e9cisent que la personne ne doit pas avoir subi de crises \u00e9pileptiques pendant une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans. De plus, des s\u00e9ries d'\u00e9lectroenc\u00e9phalogrammes (EEG) effectu\u00e9s au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode doivent d\u00e9montrer que la personne n'a aucune activit\u00e9 \u00e9pileptiforme.\n[20] Apr\u00e8s avoir appris que M. Audet avait subi une crise convulsive en septembre 2002, et en se fondant sur les crit\u00e8res pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9s, le CN a imm\u00e9diatement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il serait relev\u00e9 de tout poste classifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire et que ce retrait serait en vigueur pendant la p\u00e9riode d'\u00e9valuation de cinq ans. Il a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions de serre-frein et chef de train pour une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans.\n[21] En octobre 2005, lorsque le Tribunal a tenu l'audience \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Audet, ce dernier n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 au travail par le CN, que ce soit pour un poste classifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou non. Il a re\u00e7u des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de juin 2005. Le CN n'a pas officiellement cong\u00e9di\u00e9 M. Audet.\n[22] M. Audet a subi trois autres crises convulsives apr\u00e8s celle du 10 septembre 2002, (une en juin, une en septembre et une en novembre 2003). Apr\u00e8s la derni\u00e8re de ces crises convulsives, ses m\u00e9dicaments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s et il n'a pas eu de crises convulsives depuis ce moment.\nD. Les relations de M. Audet avec le CN apr\u00e8s qu'il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions [23] M. Audet a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions, il a eu des rapports fr\u00e9quents avec Medisys. Il a sign\u00e9 un formulaire autorisant Medisys \u00e0 consulter ses dossiers d'h\u00f4pital. Le 1er novembre 2002, son neurologue a rempli un formulaire, d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par l'Association des chemins de fers du Canada, se rapportant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de l'\u00e9pilepsie ou d'une crise \u00e9pileptique isol\u00e9e subie par une personne qui occupe un poste classifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire. Le formulaire est essentiellement un rapport m\u00e9dical. M. Audet a transmis le formulaire \u00e0 Medisys.\n[24] Environ une semaine apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions, M. Audet a pris contact avec son repr\u00e9sentant syndical des Travailleurs unis des transports (TUT), Glenn King, pour signaler la crise convulsive qu'il avait eue et pour examiner la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle il pourrait obtenir un accommodement quant \u00e0 son emploi. M. Audet a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions, il se rendait encore r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement aux installations de Capreol et demandait aux membres du personnel de gestion du CN sur place s'ils pouvaient lui fournir un accommodement en lui donnant un autre poste. Une des personnes auxquelles il parlait \u00e9tait Brian Gillies, un coordinateur de trains aux installations de Capreol. M. Audet pr\u00e9tend que M. Gillies lui a conseill\u00e9 de prendre contact avec les bureaux de gestion du CN \u00e0 Toronto pour s'informer des possibilit\u00e9s d'obtenir un accommodement. M. Audet a suivi sa suggestion et a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au bureau de Toronto \u00e0 plusieurs reprises entre 2002 et 2005. On lui disait toujours que quelqu'un examinerait sa situation et le rappellerait pour discuter de son cas. Personne ne l'a jamais fait.\n[25] Apr\u00e8s le 12 septembre 2002, M. Nadon n'a jamais reparl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Audet quant \u00e0 son emploi ou quant \u00e0 quelque accommodement. Selon M. Nadon, il ne lui appartenait pas d'entreprendre des discussions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il s'agissait d'une t\u00e2che relevant du service des ressources humaines du CN et du bureau de gestion du risque du CN.\n[26] M. Audet a fr\u00e9quemment communiqu\u00e9 par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec June Sheppard, une infirmi\u00e8re autoris\u00e9e travaillant chez Medisys, qui s'occupait du dossier de M. Audet. M. Audet l'a inform\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, y compris des trois crises convulsives qu'il avait subies en 2003. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il lui demandait souvent ce qui pouvait \u00eatre fait en vue de lui fournir un accommodement. Elle disait toujours qu'elle examinerait la question, mais il n'a jamais re\u00e7u de renseignements quant \u00e0 l'issue des d\u00e9marches qu'elle faisait.\n[27] Les mois passaient et M. Audet pr\u00e9tend que puisqu'il n'avait re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse du CN il a, le 21 ao\u00fbt 2003, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne dans laquelle il all\u00e9guait ne pas avoir obtenu un accommodement.\nE. Le CN invite M. Audet \u00e0 subir des tests pour un poste de coordinateur du transport intermodal - en d\u00e9cembre 2003 [28] Selon M. Audet, ce n'est qu'en d\u00e9cembre 2003, presque quatre mois apr\u00e8s qu'il eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, qu'il a re\u00e7u pour la premi\u00e8re fois des nouvelles du CN \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un accommodement. Richard Theberge, qui \u00e9tait l'agent de gestion du risque du CN pour la r\u00e9gion nord de l'Ontario, a pris contact avec M. Audet lui demandant de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une entrevue et de faire un test pour un poste bilingue de coordinateur du transport intermodal aux installations MacMillan \u00e0 Toronto. M. Audet n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement consult\u00e9 quant \u00e0 ce poste. On ne lui avait jamais demand\u00e9 s'il pensait \u00eatre apte \u00e0 occuper ce poste. N\u00e9anmoins, comme M. Theberge a mentionn\u00e9 dans une note de service de suivi \u00e0 M. King, M. Audet semblait avoir h\u00e2te de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'entrevue et de faire les tests.\n[29] M. Audet s'est rendu \u00e0 Toronto pour subir une entrevue et pour faire des tests. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'on lui a fait subir un test d'aptitude g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui contenait ce qu'il d\u00e9crit comme des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'aspect [traduction] administratif ou de secr\u00e9tariat. Par exemple, ses habilet\u00e9s en dactylographie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9es. M. Audet n'avait aucune exp\u00e9rience de travail dans des postes requ\u00e9rant de telles habilet\u00e9s. Il a eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 faire les tests, mais pas seulement parce qu'ils se rapportaient \u00e0 des domaines dans lesquels il n'avait pas d'exp\u00e9rience et d'habilet\u00e9s. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il avait ce jour-l\u00e0 des maux de t\u00eate et de la pression pr\u00e8s des yeux. Il avait des probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 se concentrer sur les questions, m\u00eame s'il pouvait dire que certaines de ces questions \u00e9taient simples. Ses mains tremblaient.\n[30] Les r\u00e9sultats de ses tests \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s faibles, se situant entre les premier et cinqui\u00e8me centiles. Le r\u00e9sultat minimal requis pour ce type de poste \u00e9tait le 25e centile. On ne lui a par cons\u00e9quent pas offert le poste. La personne qui faisait passer le test a \u00e9crit dans son rapport de suivi au service des ressources humaines du CN que M. Audet avait \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises au cours du test fait des commentaires selon lesquels il sentait que les m\u00e9dicaments qu'il prenait \u00e0 ce moment avaient un effet sur son rendement.\n[31] Peu apr\u00e8s les tests, un autre neurologue a pris la rel\u00e8ve aupr\u00e8s de M. Audet quant \u00e0 son traitement et il a imm\u00e9diatement chang\u00e9 le dosage des m\u00e9dicaments qu'il prenait. Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2004, le neurologue a \u00e9crit une note, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise \u00e0 Medisys, dans laquelle il \u00e9non\u00e7ait que les difficult\u00e9s subies par M. Audet au cours des tests avaient un lien avec les m\u00e9dicaments qu'il prenait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Le neurologue demandait avec insistance au CN d'examiner la possibilit\u00e9 de faire passer de nouveau le test \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ces difficult\u00e9s \u00e9taient maintenant [traduction] r\u00e9gl\u00e9es. M. Audet a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le CN n'a r\u00e9agi d'aucune fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la note. M. Audet n'a re\u00e7u aucune offre de subir d'autres tests avant mai 2005, environ cinq mois apr\u00e8s que la Commission eut renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal la plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne.\nF. Le CN offre \u00e0 M. Audet un poste de commis au mouvement des trains - en juillet 2004 [32] Le 19 juillet 2004, M. Theberge a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Audet une lettre par laquelle il lui offrait un poste de commis au mouvement des trains (CMT) \u00e0 l'\u00e9difice administratif au triage MacMillan. M. Theberge mentionnait que l'emploi lui \u00e9tait offert suivant le Programme de gestion des limitations fonctionnelles du CN. Le poste comportait du travail s\u00e9dentaire, travail qui serait supervis\u00e9 par l'\u00e9quipe du programme de retour au travail, compos\u00e9e d'infirmi\u00e8res et de m\u00e9decins de Medisys, de m\u00eame que de kin\u00e9siologues. Une description des exigences physiques et des conditions de travail se rapportant \u00e0 ce poste \u00e9tait jointe \u00e0 la lettre. Cette description mentionnait qu'un CMT peut passer jusqu'\u00e0 trois heures par quart de travail \u00e0 conduire un v\u00e9hicule.\n[33] Le 21 juillet 2004, M. Audet a r\u00e9pondu par \u00e9crit \u00e0 la lettre de M. Theberge. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas de permis de conduire valide \u00e0 ce moment. \u00c0 la suite de la crise convulsive subie par M. Audet en novembre 2003, le minist\u00e8re des Transports de l'Ontario avait suspendu son permis de conduire, suivant l'avis de son neurologue. Il n'\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 obtenir de nouveau son permis avant le d\u00e9but de 2005. M. Audet a ajout\u00e9 dans sa r\u00e9ponse qu'il esp\u00e9rait que M. Theberge [traduction] puisse tenir compte de ces facteurs. M. Audet terminait sa lettre en fournissant son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et en demandant \u00e0 M. Theberge de prendre contact avec lui s'il avait des questions.\n[34] M. Audet a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'a pas re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa lettre, et qu'il a donc appel\u00e9 M. Theberge. Ils se sont parl\u00e9 le 4 octobre 2004. Selon M. Audet, M. Theberge a pr\u00e9tendu, au cours de leur conversation, que le CN avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exigence quant au permis de conduire dans le cas de M. Audet et que M. Audet en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 auparavant inform\u00e9. M. Audet a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Theberge qu'au contraire on ne l'avait jamais inform\u00e9 d'une telle renonciation. M. Audet a alors demand\u00e9, si effectivement l'exigence de d\u00e9tenir un permis conduire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lev\u00e9e, si le poste \u00e9tait toujours disponible. M. Theberge a r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne l'\u00e9tait pas.\nG. Le CN invite M. Audet \u00e0 subir des tests pour un travail de bureau - en mai 2005 [35] Le CN n'a pas pris de nouveau contact avec M. Audet quant \u00e0 des possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi avant mai 2005. Le CN l'a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 se rendre de nouveau au triage MacMillan \u00e0 Toronto pour subir des tests. Suzanne Fusco, la directrice des ressources humaines pour l'Est du Canada, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait simplement de [traduction] tests pour du travail de bureau, qui ne se rapportaient \u00e0 aucun poste en particulier. Les tests ont eu lieu le 25 mai 2005 et, selon M. Audet, ils portaient principalement sur des habilet\u00e9s en secr\u00e9tariat, encore plus que la premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie de tests subis en d\u00e9cembre 2003. Il y avait de nouveau une \u00e9valuation des habilet\u00e9s en dactylographie et de nombreuses portions des tests \u00e9taient \u00e0 temps fixes. Plusieurs semaines plus tard, M. Audet a re\u00e7u un appel d'un repr\u00e9sentant du CN l'informant qu'il avait eu un pi\u00e8tre r\u00e9sultat aux tests, sans lui donner d'autres d\u00e9tails. Aucun rapport de suivi ne lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni.\nH. Le CN offre \u00e0 M. Audet un poste de contrema\u00eetre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en vertu de la r\u00e8gle 42 - le 13 octobre 2005 [36] Le 13 octobre 2005, seulement quatre jours avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience tenue par le Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte, l'avocat du CN a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avocat de M. Audet une lettre \u00e9non\u00e7ant qu'il y avait au CN un poste disponible qui pourrait constituer un accommodement quant \u00e0 ses diverses restrictions. Le poste \u00e9tait un poste de contrema\u00eetre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en vertu de la r\u00e8gle 42, et le lieu de travail devait \u00eatre la grande r\u00e9gion de Toronto et le district des Grands Lacs. Il serait n\u00e9cessaire que M. Audet fasse certains tests avant qu'il puisse obtenir le poste.\n[37] Le 14 octobre 2005, l'avocat de M. Audet a r\u00e9pondu que le poste n'\u00e9tait [traduction] pas satisfaisant. Le lieu de travail \u00e9tait loin de son terminal d'attache \u00e0 Capreol, et le salaire pour ce poste \u00e9tait consid\u00e9rablement moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que le salaire qu'il recevait auparavant. Il y avait de plus certaines pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des heures et des t\u00e2ches du poste qui pouvaient contrevenir aux restrictions de M. Audet \u00e9tablies par le m\u00e9decin chef du CN en 1997. En outre, il s'agissait d'un poste relevant d'une autre unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation, qui \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un autre syndicat que les TUT. La possibilit\u00e9 que M. Audet puisse conserver ses droits d'anciennet\u00e9 d\u00e9pendrait de la coop\u00e9ration du nouveau syndicat. L'avocat de M. Audet a soulign\u00e9 que son client avait une attente raisonnable selon laquelle le CN ferait de plus grands efforts pour lui fournir un accommodement quant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience. Il a de plus soulign\u00e9 que M. Audet ne refusait pas cat\u00e9goriquement l'offre d'emploi.\n[38] \u00c0 la fin de l'audience, M. Audet n'avait pas encore rejet\u00e9 officiellement l'offre, mais au cours des observations finales, l'avocat de M. Audet a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 ses r\u00e9serves pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du poste qui \u00e9tait offert.\nII. CE QUI DOIT \u00caTRE D\u00c9MONTR\u00c9 POUR \u00c9TABLIR L'EXISTENCE DE DISCRIMINATION DANS LA PR\u00c9SENTE AFFAIRE [39] Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait de refuser de continuer d'employer un individu du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience (articles 3 et 7 de la Loi). Une d\u00e9ficience est d\u00e9finie \u00e0 l'article 25 de la Loi comme une d\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu'elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e. Cette d\u00e9finition a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme signifiant tout handicap physique ou mental qui occasionne une limitation fonctionnelle ou qui est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la perception d'un handicap (voir l'arr\u00eat Desormeaux c. La Corporation de la Ville d'Ottawa, 2005 CAF3 11, au paragraphe 15). Le CN per\u00e7oit incontestablement l'\u00e9pilepsie de M. Audet, qui a occasionn\u00e9 ses crises convulsives, comme une limitation \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d'occuper un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Je suis par cons\u00e9quent convaincu que son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 constitue une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[40] Le comportement de l'employeur ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme discriminatoire s'il peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que son refus \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tout emploi d\u00e9coule d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (EPJ) (le paragraphe 15(1) de la Loi). Il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli, pour qu'un acte soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une EPJ, que le fait de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituerait pour la personne qui doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces besoins une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\n[41] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (arr\u00eat Meiorin), la m\u00e9thode devant \u00eatre suivie pour \u00e9tablir s'il existe une EPJ. Le plaignant a le fardeau initial d'\u00e9tablir que la norme ou la politique adopt\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 est prima facie discriminatoire.\n[42] Une fois que l'existence de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie prima facie, l'intim\u00e9 peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e en \u00e9tablissant ce qui suit, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s:\nL'intim\u00e9 a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause; l'intim\u00e9 a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, l'intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il est impossible de composer avec le plaignant sans que l'intim\u00e9 subisse une contrainte excessive. Il appartient \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer qu'il a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d'accommodement (Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 (arr\u00eat Grismer)).\nA. La preuve prima facie [43] Bien que le CN n'ait jamais officiellement cong\u00e9di\u00e9 M. Audet, il a incontestablement relev\u00e9 M. Audet de son poste de serre-frein ou de chef de train imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir appris qu'il avait subi une crise convulsive le 10 septembre 2002. Le CN a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de tenir M. Audet \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart de son poste pendant une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans, p\u00e9riode apr\u00e8s laquelle il pouvait reprendre son poste dans la mesure o\u00f9 il n'avait pas subi d'autres crises convulsives. Le CN ne l'a affect\u00e9 \u00e0 aucun autre poste ni \u00e0 aucune autre t\u00e2ches dans l'intervalle.\n[44] Je suis convaincu que M. Audet a \u00e9tabli prima facie que le CN a effectivement refus\u00e9 de continuer de l'employer du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience. Il appartient par cons\u00e9quent au CN d'\u00e9tablir que son refus d'employer M. Audet \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9.\nB. La justification du CN [45] Le CN pr\u00e9tend que le norme adopt\u00e9e et le comportement qui s'en est suivi \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9s. Compte tenu des restrictions importantes impos\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Audet sur le plan m\u00e9dical, qui incluaient non seulement celles se rapportant \u00e0 son \u00e9pilepsie, mais \u00e9galement celles se rapportant \u00e0 sa blessure au dos, le CN pr\u00e9tend qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de lui fournir un accommodement individuel sans que cela constitue une contrainte excessive.\nC. L'application du crit\u00e8re de l'arr\u00eat Meoirin (i) La norme adopt\u00e9e par le CN a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause? [46] Le CN estime que les postes de serre-frein et de chef de train sont des postes qualifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Les travailleurs qui occupent ces postes participent directement \u00e0 la manuvre des trains. Comme le mentionnent les lignes directrices de l'ACFC, si le rendement des personnes qui occupent des postes qualifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est perturb\u00e9 en raison d'un trouble m\u00e9dical, cela pourrait provoquer un incident qui mettrait en danger la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s et de la population et causer des dommages aux biens et \u00e0 l'environnement. Les individus qui occupent de tels postes qualifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 doivent par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre aptes sur le plan m\u00e9dical \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter leurs fonctions.\n[47] Le CN a appliqu\u00e9 une norme qu'il a tir\u00e9e des lignes directrices de l'ACFC selon laquelle, dans des cas comme celui de M. Audet o\u00f9 l'\u00e9pilepsie est trait\u00e9e au moyen de m\u00e9dicaments contre l'\u00e9pilepsie, un employ\u00e9 sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme apte sur le plan m\u00e9dical \u00e0 exercer un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 s'il n'a eu aucune crise convulsive pendant une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans. L'employ\u00e9 est sujet \u00e0 une surveillance continue de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\n[48] \u00c0 mon avis, il y a un lien rationnel \u00e9vident entre d'une part le but qui consiste \u00e0 \u00e9viter les incidents qui mettraient en danger la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s et de la population et causeraient des dommages aux biens et \u00e0 l'environnement, et d'autre part l'ex\u00e9cution des emplois de serre-frein et de chef de train. L'exploitation s\u00e9curitaire du syst\u00e8me ferroviaire pr\u00e9occupe de fa\u00e7on certaine le CN. La pr\u00e9vention d'un incident qui pourrait mettre en danger la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s et de la population est rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de tels postes qualifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n(ii) Le CN a-t-il adopt\u00e9 la norme en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but? [49] Je suis convaincu que le CN a adopt\u00e9 cette norme de bonne foi, en croyant qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer l'exploitation s\u00e9curitaire de son syst\u00e8me ferroviaire.\n(iii) A-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il est impossible de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet sans que cela constitue une contrainte excessive pour le CN? [50] Pour d\u00e9montrer qu'une norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire (la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin), un employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il est impossible de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 certains employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le plaignant sans s'imposer une contrainte excessive.\na) M. Audet a-t-il fait l'objet d'une \u00e9valuation individuelle? [51] La Cour supr\u00eame, dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, au paragraphe 64, conseille aux cours de justice et aux tribunaux administratifs de tenir compte des diverses mani\u00e8res dont il est possible de composer avec les capacit\u00e9s d'un individu. Un employeur devrait se renseigner sur la possibilit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter le travail de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res tout en r\u00e9alisant l'objet l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi que vise l'employeur. Les aptitudes, les capacit\u00e9s et l'apport potentiel du plaignant et de ceux qui sont dans la m\u00eame situation que lui doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9s autant qu'il est possible de le faire.\n[52] Ces facteurs sont de plus refl\u00e9t\u00e9s dans les lignes directrices de l'ACFC elles-m\u00eames. La section 4 des lignes directrices de l'ACFC pr\u00e9voit le crit\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral applicable \u00e0 l'aptitude m\u00e9dicale dans des cas d'\u00e9pilepsie, mais le paragraphe 6 pr\u00e9cise que l'employeur ne devrait pas conclure qu'un individu n'est pas apte au travail sans avoir d'abord effectu\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation individuelle \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du poste particulier de l'individu :\n6. \u00c9valuation individuelle\nL'aptitude \u00e0 occuper un poste sp\u00e9cifique des personnes atteintes d'\u00e9pilepsie et de celles ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes d'autres formes de crises convulsives devra \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e individuellement. La nature des t\u00e2ches et des responsabilit\u00e9s associ\u00e9es aux postes classifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ferroviaire devra \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9e soigneusement avant de prendre une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive concernant l'aptitude au travail des personnes qui d\u00e9sirent les occuper.\n[53] Quels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le CN pour \u00e9valuer individuellement M. Audet quant \u00e0 son aptitude \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 titre de serre-frein ou de chef de train? Rien ne d\u00e9montre que le CN a tent\u00e9 de faire une telle \u00e9valuation avant le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2003, presque quatre mois apr\u00e8s que M. Audet eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, et exactement 15 mois apr\u00e8s qu'il eut subi sa crise convulsive. Ce jour-l\u00e0, le Dr Claude Lapierre, le m\u00e9decin chef du CN, a \u00e9crit au Dr Guy R\u00e9millard, un neurologue de Montr\u00e9al, une lettre par laquelle il lui demandait son [traduction] avis professionnel sur la nature des troubles \u00e9pileptiques dont [M. Audet] souffrait et la recommandation [du Dr R\u00e9millard] \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son aptitude \u00e0 occuper un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[54] Le Dr R\u00e9millard n'a pas rencontr\u00e9 ou examin\u00e9 M. Audet personnellement, et on ne lui a pas non plus demand\u00e9 de le faire. Jackie Anderson, une infirmi\u00e8re dans l'\u00e9quipe Medisys du CN, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le [traduction] protocole normal consiste \u00e0 faire un [traduction] examen sur dossier de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d'un employ\u00e9 qui souffre d'\u00e9pilepsie. L'\u00e9valuation est faite sur le fondement des renseignements fournis par les m\u00e9decins et les sp\u00e9cialistes qui traitent l'employ\u00e9. Mme Anderson a ajout\u00e9 que l'\u00e9valuation est habituellement faite en consultation avec le m\u00e9decin chef du CN. Dans certains cas complexes comme celui de M. Audet, on demande l'avis d'un sp\u00e9cialiste quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 afin d'\u00e9tablir si l'\u00e9valuation de Medisys est correcte.\n[55] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le dossier, le Dr R\u00e9millard a discut\u00e9 de la question avec le Dr Lapierre, qui \u00e0 son tour a expos\u00e9 le contenu de leur conversation dans un message de suivi envoy\u00e9 par courriel \u00e0 Mme Sheppard chez Medisys. Apparemment, la question de savoir si la crise convulsive de M. Audet avait \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e par le manque de sommeil associ\u00e9 aux exigences de son poste \u00e9tait au cur des discussions des deux m\u00e9decins. Les lignes directrices de l'ACFC pr\u00e9voient que lorsque la crise convulsive est provoqu\u00e9e, l'employ\u00e9 peut \u00eatre jug\u00e9 apte \u00e0 occuper un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u00e8s qu'un an s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis la crise convulsive. Selon le Dr R\u00e9millard, la crise convulsive de M. Audet n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e par un manque de sommeil, mais \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t survenue comme une r\u00e9currence de son \u00e9pilepsie. Par cons\u00e9quent, en tant que personne qui souffre d'\u00e9pilepsie qui a subi une crise convulsive, M. Audet n'\u00e9tait pas apte \u00e0 occuper un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pendant une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans, compte tenu de la section 4 des lignes directrices de l'ACFC.\n[56] Cependant, il n'y a pas de preuve quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si le Dr Lapierre ou le Dr R\u00e9millard avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tudi\u00e9 soigneusement la nature des t\u00e2ches et des responsabilit\u00e9s associ\u00e9es au poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qu'occupait M. Audet, comme le pr\u00e9voyait le paragraphe 6 des lignes directrices de l'ACFC. Plut\u00f4t, en se fondant sur la conclusion selon laquelle la crise convulsive n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e, le Dr Lapierre estimait apparemment qu'aucune autre enqu\u00eate n'\u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e et il a retourn\u00e9 le dossier de M. Audet \u00e0 Medisys.\n[57] Je ne suis pas convaincu, selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, que le CN ait fait quelque effort pour \u00e9valuer individuellement M. Audet en vue d'\u00e9tablir si son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 l'emp\u00eachait d'ex\u00e9cuter ses t\u00e2ches et ses responsabilit\u00e9s dans ses postes de serre-frein et de chef de train. Le CN semblait se concentrer sur la question de savoir s'il \u00e9tait responsable d'avoir provoqu\u00e9 la crise convulsive de M. Audet en raison de la charge de travail qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e au cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2002. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il est tr\u00e8s r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que l'un des derniers commentaires faits par le Dr Lapierre dans son message envoy\u00e9 par courriel soit que [traduction] M. Audet a tr\u00e8s peu de chances de convaincre quelque tribunal qu' il avait seulement subi une crise convulsive provoqu\u00e9e. Aucune mention ne porte sur la question de savoir si M. Audet, en tant qu'individu, pourrait toujours de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire exercer ses fonctions et si non, comment il pourrait obtenir un accommodement \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[58] En plus de vouloir \u00e9tablir s'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que M. Audet soit relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions pour une p\u00e9riode d'un an ou de cinq ans, il peut y avoir une autre raison pour laquelle l'attention du CN portait sur la question de savoir si la crise convulsive avait \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e par sa charge de travail. Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s quant \u00e0 une longue dispute qui existait \u00e0 ce moment entre le CN et le syndicat des TUT \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la charge de travail du personnel roulant, y compris des serre-freins et des chefs de train. Le d\u00e9bat portait principalement sur le droit des employ\u00e9s de s'inscrire en repos apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 leur trajet. Le syndicat des TUT avait adopt\u00e9 la position selon laquelle l'employeur avait soumis ses employ\u00e9s \u00e0 des pressions afin qu'ils n'exercent pas compl\u00e8tement leur droit, en ayant pour objectif de les rendre disponibles plus rapidement pour effectuer un autre trajet. L'employeur ne partageait pas cette opinion et il pr\u00e9tendait qu'il essayait simplement d'\u00e9viter que certains employ\u00e9s s'inscrivent en repos de fa\u00e7on abusive et excessive. Je soup\u00e7onne que ces questions en suspens ont pu influencer le CN quant aux positions qu'il a adopt\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite de la crise convulsive subie par M. Audet et peuvent aident \u00e0 expliquer pourquoi le CN semblait \u00eatre si pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 de s'assurer qu'il n'avait pas provoqu\u00e9 la crise convulsive plut\u00f4t que de se concentrer \u00e0 fournir un accommodement \u00e0 son employ\u00e9.\n[59] Peu importe quels ont pu \u00eatre les motifs du CN, le fait est qu'il n'y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'une \u00e9valuation individuelle de M. Audet a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e afin d'\u00e9tablir son aptitude \u00e0 occuper un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il m'appert qu'une fois que le CN a appris que M. Audet avait subi une crise \u00e9pileptique, il a appliqu\u00e9 les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 la section 4 des lignes directrices de l'ACFC d'une mani\u00e8re habituelle et m\u00e9canique, sans aucun examen de sa situation individuelle ou de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Le CN a simplement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que M. Audet ne pourrait pas occuper un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pendant une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans, sans aucun autre examen de son aptitude individuelle \u00e0 occuper son poste.\n[60] Le CN pr\u00e9tend qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9valuer l'aptitude individuelle de M. Audet. La nature des t\u00e2ches d'un serre-frein et d'un chef de train est telle que toute personne qui subit une crise \u00e9pileptique, comme M. Audet, est imm\u00e9diatement m\u00e9dicalement inapte \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter ces t\u00e2ches qualifi\u00e9es comme essentielles pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[61] Cet argument ne me convainc pas. Le fait de permettre \u00e0 un employeur d'invoquer des opinions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des d\u00e9ficiences de ses employ\u00e9s qu'il per\u00e7oit d'une certaine fa\u00e7on comme \u00e9videntes en elles-m\u00eames, donnerait \u00e0 l'employeur une justification trop facile \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un comportement qui pourrait autrement \u00eatre discriminatoire. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame a mentionn\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Grismer, au paragraphe 19, la raison pour laquelle l'accommodement doit \u00eatre incorpor\u00e9 dans une norme vise \u00e0 s'assurer que chacun est \u00e9valu\u00e9 selon ses propres capacit\u00e9s personnelles plut\u00f4t qu'en fonction des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es caract\u00e9ristiques d'un groupe qui sont souvent fond\u00e9es sur un parti pris et des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s de longue date. Une \u00e9valuation individuelle de l'employ\u00e9 est par cons\u00e9quent une \u00e9tape essentielle dans le processus d'accommodement (voir l'arr\u00eat Grismer, aux paragraphes 22 et 30; et l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, au paragraphe 65).\nb) L'employeur a-t-il envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d'accommodement? [62] M\u00eame si l'opinion du CN quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'effectuer une \u00e9valuation individuelle dans le cas de M. Audet \u00e9tait une opinion valable, la question qui devrait toutefois toujours \u00eatre trait\u00e9e est celle de savoir si le CN, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli que M. Audet \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicalement inapte \u00e0 occuper son poste, a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement tous les autres moyens possibles d'accommodement qu'il pouvait lui offrir. \u00c0 mon avis, le CN n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'il a satisfait \u00e0 cette exigence.\n[63] M. Audet a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lui et M. King avaient demand\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises au CN de coop\u00e9rer avec M. Audet afin de trouver une certaine forme d'accommodement qui lui permettrait de recommencer \u00e0 travailler au CN. Ces tentatives \u00e9taient effectivement inscrites dans le registre que Mme Sheppard gardait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce qui se passait dans le dossier de M. Audet tenu chez Medisys. D\u00e8s le 17 septembre 2002, Mme Sheppard a not\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Audet, qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du [traduction] d\u00e9nouement futur de son affaire et de sa [traduction] capacit\u00e9 de travailler. Il y a plusieurs mentions des conversations de Mme Sheppard avec M. King \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses tentatives de prendre contact avec le CN pour trouver une certaine forme d'accommodement pour M. Audet. Mme Anderson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait examin\u00e9 les notes dans le dossier de M. Audet et elle a reconnu qu'il avait [traduction] manifestement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Sheppard \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un accommodement quant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[64] Comment le CN a-t-il r\u00e9agi \u00e0 ces demandes? Quels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en vue de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet? Le CN a \u00e9tabli certaines directives qui doivent \u00eatre suivies lorsqu'il s'agit de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s qui ont des besoins sp\u00e9ciaux (les directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement), dont des extraits se trouvent \u00e0 l'onglet 31 de la pi\u00e8ce C-1. Les directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement pr\u00e9voient que lorsque les superviseurs et les gestionnaires de l'employ\u00e9 sont conscients des besoins d'accommodement de l'employ\u00e9, ils ont la responsabilit\u00e9 d'entamer la proc\u00e9dure d'accommodement, m\u00eame si l'employ\u00e9 n'a pas fait une demande \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (paragraphe 7.12.3). Les gestionnaires et les superviseurs du CN \u00e9taient de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente conscients du besoin d'accommodement de M. Audet; ce sont les gestionnaires et les superviseurs qui l'ont d'abord relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions parce que, selon eux, sa d\u00e9ficience le rendait inapte \u00e0 occuper un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[65] Quelles sont les proc\u00e9dures entam\u00e9es par le CN en vue d'offrir un accommodement? Le paragraphe 7.12.4 des directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement pr\u00e9voit que la [traduction] premi\u00e8re chose que l'employeur doit faire est de rencontrer l'employ\u00e9 et de lui permettre d'exposer le probl\u00e8me ou le besoin. Le repr\u00e9sentant de l'employeur devrait poser \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 des questions afin de comprendre compl\u00e8tement la demande, et les deux personnes devraient alors ensemble discuter des solutions possibles.\n[66] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Audet \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'est pas contest\u00e9. Aucun repr\u00e9sentant du CN ne l'a rencontr\u00e9, \u00e0 aucun moment, encore moins \u00e0 titre de [traduction] premi\u00e8re chose qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, pour discuter de sa d\u00e9ficience, pour poser des questions ou pour discuter de solutions possibles. M. Audet a tent\u00e9 d'obtenir du CN tous les renseignements et toute l'aide possible, mais sans succ\u00e8s. M. Nadon, apr\u00e8s qu'il eut relev\u00e9 M. Audet de ses fonctions, ne lui a plus jamais reparl\u00e9 de son emploi ou de quelque forme d'accommodement. Un autre coordinateur de trains, M. Gillies, a dirig\u00e9 M. Audet au bureau du CN \u00e0 Toronto pour ce qui est de ses demandes. Le bureau de Toronto a promis de rappeler M. Audet, mais ne l'a pas fait.\n[67] En fait, il n'y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve donnant \u00e0 penser que le CN ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 discut\u00e9 avec M. Audet des possibilit\u00e9s quant \u00e0 un accommodement \u00e0 un moment ou un autre avant qu'il d\u00e9pose sa plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne en ao\u00fbt 2003. Environ quatre mois apr\u00e8s que la plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, l'agent de gestion du risque, M. Theberge, a finalement pris contact avec M. Audet, mais non pas pour lui demander ses commentaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa d\u00e9ficience ou pour discuter de solutions possibles, conform\u00e9ment aux directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement. M. Theberge a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Audet pour lui pr\u00e9senter une seule possibilit\u00e9 - se rendre \u00e0 Toronto pour subir une entrevue et pour faire des tests quant \u00e0 un poste en particulier. Il n'y a eu aucune discussion avec M. Audet sur la question de savoir s'il avait les habilet\u00e9s requises pour occuper un poste d'employ\u00e9 de bureau, par exemple un poste de coordinateur \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition.\n[68] M\u00eame s'il s'agissait de la premi\u00e8re offre d'accommodement \u00e0 \u00eatre en fait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Audet, le CN a-t-il au moins examin\u00e9 d'autres possibilit\u00e9s d'accommodement avant ce moment sans que M. Audet en ait eu connaissance? La preuve montre que les efforts du CN, m\u00eame \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, \u00e9taient au mieux minimaux.\n[69] Mme Anderson, chef d'\u00e9quipe chez Medisys, a expliqu\u00e9 que ce n'\u00e9tait pas la responsabilit\u00e9 de Medisys de trouver un poste pour fournir un accommodement aux employ\u00e9s du CN qui souffraient d'une d\u00e9ficience. Le r\u00f4le de l'\u00e9quipe de Medisys \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard consiste simplement \u00e0 prendre contact avec le service des ressources humaines du CN, avec l'agent de gestion du risque et avec les superviseurs de l'employ\u00e9 pour faire une demande afin que l'employ\u00e9 obtienne un accommodement quant \u00e0 un emploi.\n[70] Comme j'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, Mme Sheppard, qui s'occupait du dossier de M. Audet chez Medisys, gardait un registre dans lequel \u00e9tait consign\u00e9 ce qui se passait dans son dossier. Mme Sheppard n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors de l'audience. Ses premi\u00e8res inscriptions dans le registre apr\u00e8s que M. Audet eut \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions se rapportent aux divers documents et autres renseignements recueillis \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de m\u00eame qu'aux traitements et m\u00e9dicaments qu'il recevait. Le CN reconna\u00eet que M. Audet a toujours fourni sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 Medisys tous les documents demand\u00e9s, de type m\u00e9dical et d'autres types.\n[71] Le registre de Mme Sheppard consigne de nombreuses communications avec le CN, faites \u00e0 l'initiative de M. Audet, de M. King et d'elle-m\u00eame, au cours desquelles des demandes d'accommodement \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Les demandes n'ont donn\u00e9 en fin de compte aucun r\u00e9sultat.\n[72] Le 13 novembre 2002, Mme Sheppard a \u00e9crit dans son registre des notes portant sur une discussion qu'elle avait eue avec un agent de gestion du risque \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de trouver un poste de remplacement pour M. Audet, compte tenu du fait qu'il ne pouvait occuper un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pendant une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans. Le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2002, elle a consign\u00e9 dans son registre qu'elle avait envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 l'agent de gestion du risque, dans lequel elle lui rappelait la restriction de M. Audet selon laquelle il ne pouvait occuper un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et demandait qu'il v\u00e9rifie [traduction] s'il y avait quelque accommodement possible.\n[73] Le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2003, Mme Sheppard a apparemment parl\u00e9 du cas de M. Audet \u00e0 un expert principal de La Great West, compagnie d'assurance-vie, le fournisseur de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du CN. Mme Sheppard a not\u00e9 que l'expert s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre contact avec le CN et \u00e0 demander s'il y avait un poste qui ne serait pas qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 que pourrait occuper M. Audet.\n[74] Quelques jours plus tard, Mme Sheppard a fait elle-m\u00eame un effort semblable. Elle a inscrit dans son registre qu'elle avait envoy\u00e9 un courriel au service des ressources humaines, \u00e0 l'agent de gestion du risque, au directeur du service de sant\u00e9 au travail et au superviseur imm\u00e9diat de M. Audet, les avisant des restrictions de M. Audet et de l'\u00e9tat actuel des prestations. Elle leur a demand\u00e9 de lui fournir des commentaires quant \u00e0 [traduction] toute offre d'emploi possible. Rien dans le registre de Mme Sheppard n'indique si l'un d'eux a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette demande et aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni lors de l'audience.\n[75] Le 14 mars 2003, M. Audet a apparemment t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Sheppard. Elle a consign\u00e9 dans son registre qu'elle lui avait conseill\u00e9 de demander directement au CN s'il y avait des postes qui n'\u00e9taient pas qualifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qu'il aurait pu occuper. Le lendemain, le 15 mars 2003, Mme Sheppard a not\u00e9 qu'elle avait eu une discussion avec M. King, le repr\u00e9sentant des TUT, qui lui a dit qu'il essaierait d'aider M. Audet \u00e0 obtenir un poste pouvant servir d'accommodement [traduction] quelque part au CN.\n[76] Cependant, il est clair qu'en date du 30 juillet 2003 la question de l'accommodement n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. Mme Sheppard a \u00e9crit qu'elle avait [traduction] discut\u00e9 de nouveau avec M. King de la question de l'accommodement \u00e0 offrir \u00e0 M. Audet. M. King a dit qu'il discuterait de la question avec l'agent de gestion du risque.\n[77] Les r\u00e9sultats n'ont de toute \u00e9vidence pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fructueux. Le 15 septembre 2003, Mme Sheppard a \u00e9crit qu'elle avait parl\u00e9 de nouveau \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 M. King quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 que le CN offre un accommodement, en ajoutant qu'il n'y avait [traduction] pas eu de r\u00e9ponse de la part de la compagnie.\n[78] Le 10 novembre 2003, Mme Sheppard a \u00e9crit qu'elle avait parl\u00e9 de nouveau \u00e0 M. King, qui lui a dit qu'il essayait de prendre contact avec M. Theberge, l'agent de gestion du risque, quant \u00e0 un accommodement possible pour M. Audet.\n[79] Le 18 novembre 2003, Mme Sheppard a re\u00e7u par courriel un message de Paul Bourque, le directeur des ressources humaines dans la r\u00e9gion de M. Audet. Le message avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs autres personnes, y compris \u00e0 M. Theberge, \u00e0 M. Nadon, et \u00e0 la coordonnatrice des indemnit\u00e9s des accidents du travail, Louise Smolska. M. Bourque les informait que M. Audet avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Afin de pr\u00e9parer une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la Commission, M. Bourque leur demandait de fournir tout renseignement se rapportant aux efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s depuis le 11 septembre 2002 en vue de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet et en particulier de mentionner tout emploi qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 comme accommodement.\n[80] La r\u00e9ponse de Mme Smolska au message envoy\u00e9 par courriel par M. Bourque a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e lors de l'audience. Elle disait qu'[traduction] aucun emploi n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 par son groupe. Il n'y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'il y avait eu des r\u00e9ponses des autres personnes qui avaient re\u00e7u par courriel le message de M. Bourque.\n[81] Le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2003, M. Bourque a envoy\u00e9 par courriel un message \u00e0 plusieurs personnes au CN, qui avaient un lien avec le cas de M. Audet, les avisant qu'on avait trouv\u00e9 deux postes (coordinateur \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition et commis au mouvement des trains) qui \u00e9taient appropri\u00e9s pour une personne soumise \u00e0 des restrictions. M. Bourque a demand\u00e9 que des dispositions soient prises afin que M. Audet subisse des tests quant \u00e0 ces postes. Rien n'indique que M. Audet et M. King aient \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9s d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre avant que cette d\u00e9cision soit prise. Les tests mentionn\u00e9s dans le message envoy\u00e9 par courriel \u00e9taient les tests subis par M. Audet \u00e0 Toronto en d\u00e9cembre 2003, pour lesquels il n'a pas obtenu une note de passage en raison en partie, selon ce qu'il pr\u00e9tend, du dosage de ses m\u00e9dicaments \u00e0 ce moment.\n[82] Le 13 avril 2004, Mme Sheppard a envoy\u00e9 par courriel un message \u00e0 M. Theberge et \u00e0 d'autres personnes pour leur transmettre ce que M. Audet lui avait communiqu\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir que son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 \u00e9tait stable et qu'il serait capable de mieux r\u00e9ussir des tests. Mme Sheppard demandait s'il y avait une possibilit\u00e9 de lui offrir un accommodement quant \u00e0 un poste qui n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. M. Theberge a simplement r\u00e9pondu que [traduction] quant \u00e0 tout autre poste, il n'y rien de disponible \u00e0 Capreol.\n[83] Quel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve y a-t-il quant aux tentatives faites par le CN, si tentative il y a eu, pour trouver du travail \u00e0 M. Audet \u00e0 son terminal d'attache \u00e0 Capreol? M. Nadon a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne connaissait pas l'exigence contenue dans les directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement du CN selon laquelle les gestionnaires de l'employ\u00e9 devaient le rencontrer afin de discuter du probl\u00e8me et des solutions possibles. M. Nadon a reconnu qu'aucune rencontre de cette sorte n'a eu lieu. Selon M. Nadon, offrir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet \u00e9tait la responsabilit\u00e9 du service des ressources humaines et du bureau de la gestion du risque.\n[84] M. Nadon se rappelait qu'on avait communiqu\u00e9 avec lui pour [traduction] voir si nous avions du travail ou un poste disponible pour [M. Audet] et nous n'avions rien dans notre service. Il a ajout\u00e9 que Medisys et le service des ressources humaines avaient communiqu\u00e9 avec lui pour voir si [traduction] nous avions des t\u00e2ches pouvant constituer un accommodement pour M. Audet. Compte tenu des restrictions qui emp\u00eachaient M. Audet d'occuper des postes qualifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, M. Nadon a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Nous savions que nous ne pouvions pas modifier le poste [de serre-frein ou de chef de train] pour lui offrir un accommodement. Cela \u00e9tait \u00e9vident. Il n'a pas envisag\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de fournir \u00e0 M. Audet une formation qui lui permettrait d'obtenir des comp\u00e9tences pour occuper des postes pour lesquels il n'avait pas encore les comp\u00e9tences. Il n'a pas envisag\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de regrouper des t\u00e2ches de plusieurs postes pour cr\u00e9er un nouveau poste pour offrir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet. M. Nadon a reconnu qu'en somme son r\u00f4le \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'accommodement devant \u00eatre offert \u00e0 M. Audet consistait \u00e0 [traduction] tenir les yeux ouverts pour tout poste \u00e0 pourvoir \u00e0 Capreol qui respecterait les restrictions impos\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Audet.\n[85] Le r\u00f4le limit\u00e9 de M. Nadon quant \u00e0 l'accommodement offert \u00e0 M. Audet soul\u00e8ve une question additionnelle. Dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour a fait allusion \u00e0 l'utilit\u00e9 en pratique, lorsque l'analyse en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement est effectu\u00e9e, d'examiner le caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e par l'employeur pour \u00e9valuer la question de l'accommodement (voir l'arr\u00eat Meorin, au paragraphe 37).\n[86] La preuve appuie la pr\u00e9tention de M. Audet selon laquelle le CN a m\u00eame omis de respecter les proc\u00e9dures expos\u00e9es dans ses propres directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement et, de ce fait, a omis de lui offrir un accommodement sur le plan proc\u00e9dural. Par exemple, ni M. Nadon ni qui que ce soit d'autre au CN n'ont rencontr\u00e9 M. Audet pour discuter de sa d\u00e9ficience et pour examiner des solutions possibles, comme les directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement le pr\u00e9voient.\n[87] Les directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement \u00e9noncent de plus qu'il est [traduction] extr\u00eamement important de conserver des notes quant \u00e0 ces rencontres avec un employ\u00e9, quant aux diverses solutions propos\u00e9es et quant aux arguments utilis\u00e9s pour accepter ou rejeter chaque possibilit\u00e9. Il n'y a \u00e9videmment pas de notes quant \u00e0 des rencontres avec M. Audet \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'aucune rencontre n'a eu lieu. Le CN n'a pas, cependant, produit de dossiers satisfaisants \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de solutions qu'il a pu analyser \u00e0 l'interne et rejet\u00e9 par lui-m\u00eame, sans la participation de M. Audet.\n[88] Mme Fusco a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve un Bulletin de l'Ing\u00e9nierie, dat\u00e9 du 17 octobre 2005. Ce bulletin consiste en une liste qui \u00e9nonce les postes qui \u00e9taient disponibles dans la r\u00e9gion des Grands Lacs en Ontario, au moment de l'audience. M. Audet soutient qu'il aurait pu obtenir un accommodement dans un poste de signaleur qui \u00e9tait disponible \u00e0 ce moment. Le CN pr\u00e9tend qu'aucun des postes figurant sur la liste n'\u00e9tait appropri\u00e9 pour M. Audet. Par exemple, le poste de signaleur comporte r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires qui auraient constitu\u00e9 une violation des restrictions qui lui \u00e9taient impos\u00e9es.\n[89] Il importe toutefois de mentionner que le CN n'a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucun Bulletin de l'Ing\u00e9nierie ni aucun autre rapport similaire couvrant la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 octobre 2005. Il n'y a en preuve aucun document d\u00e9montrant qu'apr\u00e8s que M. Audet eut \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions, le CN a examin\u00e9 et analys\u00e9 d'autres postes que les postes de commis au mouvement des trains et de coordinateur \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition. En outre, m\u00eame si d'autres postes ont en fait \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s durant cette p\u00e9riode, aucun dossier exposant les raisons pour lesquelles ils ont en fin de compte \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit.\n[90] Les directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement du CN \u00e9noncent qu'une des fa\u00e7ons suivant lesquelles l'employeur peut fournir un accommodement \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s souffrant d'une d\u00e9ficience [traduction] sans cr\u00e9er de contrainte excessive, consiste \u00e0 leur donner une [traduction] formation sp\u00e9ciale [...] pour r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le travail. Le CN n'a jamais offert \u00e0 M. Audet la possibilit\u00e9 de suivre une nouvelle formation. Mme Fusco pr\u00e9tend que le CN aurait offert \u00e0 M. Audet une formation pour le poste \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition s'il avait r\u00e9ussi l'\u00e9tape initiale des tests. Mais j'ai conclu que les tests portaient principalement sur des habilet\u00e9s de travail de bureau qu'il ne poss\u00e9dait manifestement pas. Il avait besoin d'une formation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces habilet\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e9valu\u00e9es, qui \u00e0 leur tour lui auraient donn\u00e9 une meilleure possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9ussir les tests de qualification pour les postes de remplacement. Mme Fusco a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que le syndicat qui repr\u00e9sentait les employ\u00e9s des postes \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition ne se serait pas oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que M. Audet obtienne une formation avant de faire les tests.\n[91] \u00c0 mon avis, il s'agit l\u00e0 de seulement quelques exemples qui d\u00e9montrent la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle le CN a omis de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet sur le plan proc\u00e9dural, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il a m\u00eame omis de respecter les dispositions de base expos\u00e9es dans les propres directives du CN quant \u00e0 l'accommodement.\n[92] Par cons\u00e9quent, dans l'ensemble, quels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les efforts d'accommodement d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le CN au cours de la p\u00e9riode de trois ans, entre le moment o\u00f9 la crise convulsive est survenue le 10 septembre 2002 et le d\u00e9but de l'audience le 17 octobre 2005? Le CN a fait en tout quatre propositions quant \u00e0 l'accommodement \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 M. Audet \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa d\u00e9ficience, \u00e0 savoir :\nD\u00e9cembre 2003 - Une invitation \u00e0 faire un test qui permettrait \u00e0 M. Audet de se qualifier pour le poste de coordinateur du transport intermodal au triage MacMillan \u00e0 Toronto. Juillet 2004 - Une offre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un poste de commis au mouvement des trains au triage MacMillan \u00e0 Toronto. Mai 2005 - Une invitation \u00e0 subir des tests pour un travail de bureau. Octobre 2005 - Une offre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un poste de contrema\u00eetre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en vertu de la r\u00e8gle 42 au triage MacMillan \u00e0 Toronto.\n[93] Ces efforts d\u00e9montrent-ils que le CN a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d'accommodement? \u00c0 mon avis, la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est n\u00e9gative.\n[94] Le CN a appel\u00e9 Mme Fusco pour t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des efforts qu'il a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en vue de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet. Au cours de son interrogatoire principal, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le CN avait examin\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement \u00e0 compter de septembre 2002 tous les postes vacants qui auraient pu \u00eatre appropri\u00e9s. Cependant, lors du contre-interrogatoire, elle a confirm\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune tentative visant \u00e0 lui fournir un accommodement avant 2004 et qu'elle ne pouvait donc vraiment pas t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tout effort d'accommodement d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement. Elle a de plus reconnu qu'elle n'avait pas tenu de dossiers ou consign\u00e9 de notes quant aux efforts d'accommodement auxquels elle avait effectivement particip\u00e9. M. Nadon, comme je l'ai pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas fait de v\u00e9ritables tentatives en vue de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet autre que simplement [traduction] tenir les yeux ouverts pour des postes vacants. Selon M. Nadon, il appartenait au service des ressources humaines et \u00e0 l'agent de gestion du risque de prendre des dispositions pour fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet.\n[95] Le CN n'a pas envisag\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d'offrir \u00e0 M. Audet une formation pour lui permettre de se qualifier pour d'autres postes. Il n'y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant que le CN a envisag\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de regrouper nombre des t\u00e2ches d'un poste pour augmenter les possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi de M. Audet.\n[96] Toutefois, le CN pr\u00e9tend encore qu'entre 2002 et 2005, les postes qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts \u00e9taient les seuls emplois que M. Audet aurait pu occuper, compte tenu de ses restrictions, qui incluaient les restrictions impos\u00e9es de la CSPAAT se rapportant \u00e0 sa blessure au dos de 1995.\n[97] Aussi r\u00e9cemment qu'en juillet 2005, cependant, le syndicat des TUT a propos\u00e9 au CN de nombreux postes pour lesquels M. Audet \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 et qui \u00e9taient compatibles avec les restrictions de la CSPAAT de m\u00eame qu'avec les restrictions se rapportant \u00e0 son \u00e9pilepsie. Ces postes incluaient les postes d'auxiliaire et de surveillant pour les incendies et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Le CN a pr\u00e9tendu lors de l'audience que ces postes n'\u00e9taient plus disponibles lorsque le syndicat des TUT les a propos\u00e9s. Le CN n'a pas, cependant, expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi ils n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts \u00e0 M. Audet lorsqu'ils \u00e9taient disponibles.\n[98] Un des autres postes propos\u00e9s par le syndicat des TUT en 2005 \u00e9tait un poste de coordinateur de la circulation. Mme Fusco a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Audet ne pouvait pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 ce poste parce que ce poste \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Toutefois, elle a reconnu que le CN n'a pas examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de modifier les t\u00e2ches de ce poste afin qu'il soit compatible avec les restrictions de M. Audet. Elle a reconnu que le CN a dans le pass\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des postes qualifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 afin de fournir un accommodement quant aux restrictions d'un employ\u00e9.\n[99] Un employ\u00e9 en particulier avait re\u00e7u un diagnostic d'\u00e9pilepsie alors qu'il occupait au CN un poste de chef de train qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, tout comme M. Audet. Comme forme d'accommodement, le CN l'a affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de contr\u00f4leur de la circulation ferroviaire qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au terminal de Capreol. Ses t\u00e2ches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es afin de lui fournir un accommodement. Les contr\u00f4leurs de la circulation ferroviaire appartiennent \u00e0 la m\u00eame unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation des TUT que M. Audet.\n[100] \u00c0 mon avis, il est \u00e9vident que dans le cas de M. Audet, le CN a omis d'examiner de nombreuses formes possibles d'accommodement. En outre, il est manifeste que le peu de recherche que le CN a effectu\u00e9 n'a commenc\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s que M. Audet eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne en ao\u00fbt 2003. Avant ce moment, il n'y avait essentiellement pas eu d'efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en vue de lui fournir un accommodement.\n[101] L'avocat du CN a avanc\u00e9 dans ses observations finales que le retard du CN \u00e0 entreprendre des efforts en vue de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 l'incertitude se rapportant \u00e0 la nature de sa d\u00e9ficience. Jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'on obtienne l'opinion du Dr Lapierre, la question de savoir si M. Audet avait eu une crise convulsive provoqu\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas claire.\n[102] Cependant, cette incertitude n'est pas la question en cause. Que la crise convulsive ait \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e ou non, il reste qu'en date du 12 septembre 2002, le CN a relev\u00e9 M. Audet de ses fonctions en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. \u00c0 partir de ce moment, le CN avait l'obligation de s\u00e9rieusement chercher des fa\u00e7ons de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 son employ\u00e9. Il n'\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9 qu'il y ait un retard \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Si le CN avait besoin de conna\u00eetre les r\u00e9percussions de l'\u00e9pilepsie et de la crise convulsive de M. Audet, il aurait pu commencer par au moins rencontrer M. Audet et discuter avec lui de sa situation. M. Audet avait fourni son dossier m\u00e9dical \u00e0 Medisys. Le CN avait plus que suffisamment de renseignements pour entreprendre ses efforts en vue de fournir un accommodement. De plus, la restriction de base impos\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Audet \u00e9tait qu'il n'occupe pas des postes qualifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Le CN aurait facilement pu commencer \u00e0 chercher un poste qui n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 que M. Audet aurait pu occuper. Cependant, il n'y a pas d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'il y ait eu de telles tentatives avant d\u00e9cembre 2003.\nc) Le fait de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet aurait-il constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive pour le CN? [103] Bien que j'aie conclu que le CN n'avait pas examin\u00e9 plusieurs possibilit\u00e9s qui auraient fourni un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet, le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit qu'un employeur peut n\u00e9anmoins justifier son refus d'employer un individu en d\u00e9montrant que le fait de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de l'individu constituerait pour lui une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Le CN pr\u00e9tendait que les pr\u00e9occupations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 emp\u00eachaient M. Audet d'occuper des postes qualifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. En tenant pour acquis que ces pr\u00e9occupations \u00e9taient valables, sur quoi le CN fonde-t-il sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle le fait de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet, d'une mani\u00e8re qui ne le placerait pas dans un poste qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, constituerait une contrainte excessive? Comment le fait de regrouper plusieurs t\u00e2ches de postes qui n'\u00e9taient pas qualifi\u00e9s comme essentiels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en un seul poste ou comment le fait d'offrir une nouvelle formation \u00e0 M. Audet, par exemple, constituerait-il pour le CN une contrainte excessive, du fait du seul facteur encore applicable suivant le paragraphe 15(2), \u00e0 savoir les co\u00fbts?\n[104] Je ne dispose d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant aux co\u00fbts qui r\u00e9sulteraient du fait de fournir ces formes d'accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet. Mme Fusco a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que dans le cas de M. Audet, l'argent ou les co\u00fbts ne constituaient pas pour le CN un obstacle pour lui fournir un accommodement. M. Audet a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve un r\u00e9cit de la Presse canadienne dat\u00e9 du 21 juillet 2005, du journal North Bay Nugget, qui rapportait que les profits du CN au cours des premiers six mois de 2005 avaient [traduction] fait un bond pour atteindre 715 $ millions, alors qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 de 536 $ millions pour la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode en 2004. Les revenus du CN au cours de la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 de 2005 \u00e9taient de 3,54 $ milliards. On cite une d\u00e9claration du pr\u00e9sident du CN qui a dit ce qui suit : [traduction] Nos employ\u00e9s ont un excellent rendement et nous nous attendons \u00e0 continuer \u00e0 donner des profits importants aux actionnaires.\n[105] Dans l'arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 489, au paragraphe 62, la Cour supr\u00eame a soulign\u00e9 que l'importance de l'exploitation de l'employeur peut jouer sur l'\u00e9valuation de ce qui repr\u00e9sente un co\u00fbt excessif. Le CN est assur\u00e9ment un employeur important. Mme Fusco a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Medisys \u00e0 elle seule s'occupe de 5 000 employ\u00e9s du CN. Le CN a mis en place une infrastructure interne pour traiter des besoins particuliers de ses employ\u00e9s. Des directives officielles \u00e9tablissant la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle on peut r\u00e9pondre aux besoins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es. Mme Fusco a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en tout temps Medisys intervient activement dans jusqu'\u00e0 dix pour cent des dossiers de ces 5 000 employ\u00e9s.\n[106] Il appartient au CN de d\u00e9montrer d'une mani\u00e8re r\u00e9elle et concr\u00e8te de quelle fa\u00e7on les co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s au fait de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet constitueraient pour lui une contrainte excessive. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans l'arr\u00eat Grismer au paragraphe 41, a reconnu que dans certaines circonstances, le co\u00fbt excessif peut justifier le refus de composer avec les personnes atteintes de d\u00e9ficience. Une preuve, constitu\u00e9e d'impressions, d'une augmentation des d\u00e9penses ne suffit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas. La Cour supr\u00eame a donn\u00e9 un avertissement selon lequel il faut se garder de ne pas accorder suffisamment d'importance \u00e0 l'accommodement de la personne handicap\u00e9e, parce qu'il serait beaucoup trop facile d'invoquer l'augmentation des co\u00fbts pour justifier un refus d'accorder un traitement \u00e9gal aux personnes handicap\u00e9es.\n[107] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, on n'avait essentiellement pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve, constitu\u00e9e d'impressions ou d'un autre type, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s au fait de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet et des cons\u00e9quences pour le CN et son exploitation. Le CN n'a pas, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e9tabli que le fait de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet constituerait pour lui une contrainte excessive.\nd) M. Audet a-t-il entrav\u00e9 les efforts d'accommodement d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le CN? [108] Le CN pr\u00e9tend qu'il a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 tous les efforts raisonnables en vue de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Audet et que c'est la propre inflexibilit\u00e9 de ce dernier qui a emp\u00each\u00e9 qu'une solution soit trouv\u00e9e. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans l'arr\u00eat Renaud c. Central Okanagan School District No. 23, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, aux paragraphes 43 et 44, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un plaignant a l'obligation de faciliter la recherche d'un compromis. Ainsi, pour d\u00e9terminer si l'obligation d'accommodement a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie, il faut examiner la conduite du plaignant. Lorsque l'employeur fait une proposition qui est raisonnable et qui, si elle \u00e9tait mise en uvre, remplirait l'obligation d'accommodement, le plaignant est tenu d'en faciliter la mise en uvre. Si l'omission du plaignant de prendre des mesures raisonnables est \u00e0 l'origine de l'\u00e9chec de la proposition, la plainte sera rejet\u00e9e.\n[109] Quels aspects de la conduite de M. Audet d\u00e9montreraient qu'il est \u00e0 l'origine de l'\u00e9chec de la proposition raisonnable?\n1. La r\u00e9action de M. Audet \u00e0 l'offre, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en juillet 2004, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un poste de commis au mouvement des trains [110] On a accord\u00e9 beaucoup d'importance \u00e0 la r\u00e9action de M. Audet \u00e0 l'offre du CN de juillet 2004 quant \u00e0 un poste de commis au mouvement des trains, au triage MacMillan \u00e0 Toronto. Le CN pr\u00e9tend qu'il s'agissait d'une proposition raisonnable que M. Audet aurait d\u00fb accepter. Mais M. Audet a-t-il effectivement refus\u00e9 l'offre? Il n'a pas dit qu'il la refusait dans sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 21 juillet 2004 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Theberge. M. Audet a simplement communiqu\u00e9 le fait qu'il n'avait pas de permis de conduire. Le document exposant les exigences physiques et les conditions de travail pour le poste de commis au mouvement des trains, que M. Theberge avait envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Audet, \u00e9non\u00e7ait clairement que le poste comportait du travail [traduction] dans un v\u00e9hicule (conduite). Les conditions du milieu pour le poste stipulaient que [traduction] selon les t\u00e2ches, [l'employ\u00e9] peut passer jusqu'\u00e0 3 heures [par quart de travail de 8 heures] \u00e0 conduire un v\u00e9hicule dans le triage.\n[111] \u00c0 mon avis, il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait raisonnable que M. Audet, apr\u00e8s avoir vu ces conditions de travail se rapportant au poste propos\u00e9, ait inform\u00e9 le CN quant \u00e0 un emp\u00eachement l\u00e9gal d'ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches de l'emploi. Il ne s'agissait pas d'un manque de coop\u00e9ration de sa part. Au contraire, le fait qu'il communique ce renseignement au CN servait \u00e0 s'assurer qu'on ne perde pas de temps \u00e0 lui offrir un poste qu'il ne pouvait l\u00e9galement pas ex\u00e9cuter. Qu'est-ce que cela aurait donn\u00e9 que M. Audet accepte le poste, sachant qu'il lui manquait une des qualifications n\u00e9cessaires?\n[112] Le CN semblait sugg\u00e9rer qu'il avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exigence d'un permis de conduire dans le cas de M. Audet, mais il n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve au soutien de sa pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Plut\u00f4t, c'est M. Audet lui-m\u00eame qui a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Theberge avait fait cette d\u00e9claration au cours d'une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec lui en octobre 2004. M. Audet nie qu'on lui ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, avant cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique d'octobre 2004, alors qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 trop tard, que l'exigence quant \u00e0 la conduite d'un v\u00e9hicule avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lev\u00e9e dans son cas. Son t\u00e9moignage n'est pas contredit. M. Theberge n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'appuie sa d\u00e9claration \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[113] Si le CN avait effectivement eu l'intention de renoncer \u00e0 l'exigence quant \u00e0 la conduite d'un v\u00e9hicule, pourquoi M. Theberge n'a-t-il pas simplement r\u00e9pondu par \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Audet pour l'informer qu'il se trompait? Dans sa lettre, M. Audet avait, apr\u00e8s tout, invit\u00e9 M. Theberge \u00e0 prendre contact avec lui pour toute question. M. Audet avait m\u00eame fourni son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. M. Theberge n'a m\u00eame pas eu la courtoisie d'appeler M. Audet. Je n'estime pas que la r\u00e9action de M. Audet \u00e0 l'offre d'emploi de juillet 2004 soit \u00e0 l'origine de l'\u00e9chec de la proposition. En fait, l'\u00e9chec de la proposition est d\u00fb au fait qu'elle \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9e comme forme d'accommodement, et \u00e0 l'omission du CN d'avoir r\u00e9pondu et trait\u00e9 la pr\u00e9occupation soulev\u00e9e par M. Audet dans sa lettre et d'en avoir trait\u00e9.\n2. La pr\u00e9tendue omission du syndicat des TUT d'avoir facilit\u00e9 l'accommodement [114] Le CN pr\u00e9tendait \u00e9galement dans ses observations finales que, dans le cas de M. Audet, le syndicat des TUT avait entrav\u00e9 la mise en uvre de l'accommodement. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait mention des cinq propositions du syndicat avanc\u00e9es en juillet 2005 en vue d'un accommodement. Le CN pr\u00e9tend que le syndicat n'a fait aucune proposition similaire avant ce moment, et que son omission de le faire d\u00e9montre d'une certaine fa\u00e7on que le syndicat (et par extension M. Audet) ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation de rechercher un accommodement.\n[115] Cet argument est de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente fond\u00e9 sur une compr\u00e9hension erron\u00e9e de l'arr\u00eat Renaud. La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 passablement claire \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L'obligation qui incombe au plaignant de faire sa part ne signifie pas que le plaignant a l'obligation d'\u00eatre \u00e0 l'origine d'une solution. L'employeur est celui qui est le plus en mesure d'\u00e9tablir la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle le plaignant peut obtenir un accommodement sans que cela constitue une contrainte excessive quant \u00e0 l'exploitation de l'entreprise de l'employeur. Ce n'est qu'une fois qu'un employeur a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une proposition raisonnable que le plaignant est tenu de faciliter sa mise en uvre (arr\u00eat Renaud, au paragraphe 44).\n[116] Comment le syndicat des TUT et M. Audet peuvent-ils \u00eatre accus\u00e9s de ne pas s'\u00eatre acquitt\u00e9s de leur obligation de faciliter les propositions d'accommodement alors que le CN n'a pas avanc\u00e9 une seule proposition d'accommodement avant d\u00e9cembre 2003, et n'a pas formellement fait une seule offre d'emploi avant juillet 2004, presque deux ans apr\u00e8s qu'il a relev\u00e9 M. Audet de ses fonctions? J'estime qu'il est fallacieux de la part du CN de sugg\u00e9rer que M. Audet et le syndicat des TUT ont d'une certaine fa\u00e7on tard\u00e9 \u00e0 traiter de l'accommodement. La preuve d\u00e9montre clairement d'une part que M. Audet et M. King imploraient le CN d'entamer le processus visant \u00e0 fournir un accommodement depuis 2002 et que le CN d'autre part n'a eu de r\u00e9action ou pris quelque initiative que ce soit que bien apr\u00e8s que M. Audet ait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne.\n3. La r\u00e9action de M. Audet \u00e0 l'offre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un poste de contrema\u00eetre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en vertu de la r\u00e8gle 42 [117] Bien que le CN ait pu omettre de traiter de la question de l'accommodement pendant une longue p\u00e9riode, peut-on quand m\u00eame pr\u00e9tendre que la d\u00e9cision de M. Audet de ne pas imm\u00e9diatement accepter l'offre la plus r\u00e9cente du CN (contrema\u00eetre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en vertu de la r\u00e8gle 42), faite le 13 octobre 2005, constitue un manquement quant \u00e0 son obligation de faciliter la recherche d'un accommodement?\n[118] Tout d'abord, je ne suis pas certain que cette offre jette une lumi\u00e8re sur la question de savoir si le CN a fourni \u00e0 M. Audet un accommodement au point de constituer une contrainte excessive. Il m'appara\u00eet que cette offre d'emploi devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9crite de fa\u00e7on plus appropri\u00e9e comme une offre de r\u00e8glement, puisqu'elle est survenue seulement quelques jours avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le dernier jour d'audience, M. Audet n'avait pas encore officiellement rejet\u00e9 l'offre. De plus, \u00e0 mon avis, les pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par M. Audet ne sont pas d\u00e9raisonnables. Par exemple, l'offre du CN n'\u00e9tablissait pas tout \u00e0 fait clairement si les conditions de travail du poste respectaient les restrictions de travail de M. Audet. Effectivement, le CN lui-m\u00eame n'a pu confirmer que lors de la toute derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d'audience que le poste \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 ses restrictions de travail.\n[119] La r\u00e9action de M. Audet \u00e0 l'offre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un poste de contrema\u00eetre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 42 ne r\u00e9v\u00e9lait pas \u00e0 mon avis qu'il avait entrav\u00e9 les efforts d'accommodement du CN.\nIII. LA CONCLUSION DE DISCRIMINATION [120] Pour tous les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, je conclus que M. Audet a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi. Le CN n'a pas \u00e9tabli que son refus de continuer d'employer M. Audet d\u00e9coule d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es, suivant l'article 15 de la Loi. La plainte de M. Audet est par cons\u00e9quent fond\u00e9e.\nIV. LES REDRESSEMENTS SOLLICIT\u00c9S PAR M. AUDET A. Une ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant que le CN r\u00e9vise sa politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement [121] M. Audet sollicite une ordonnance, suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi, pr\u00e9voyant que le CN prenne des mesures, en consultation avec la Commission, pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 son omission d'avoir correctement fourni un accommodement \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s, comme sa propre affaire le d\u00e9montrait. M. Audet reconna\u00eet que le CN a une politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement, c'est-\u00e0-dire des directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement, et qu'il peut en fait s'agir d'une bonne politique, mais il pr\u00e9tend qu'elle n'est manifestement pas appliqu\u00e9e ou mise en uvre correctement.\n[122] J'ai renvoy\u00e9 dans ma d\u00e9cision aux directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement et j'ai \u00e9tabli que les personnes qui sont charg\u00e9es au CN de leur mise en uvre ont effectivement omis de les suivre dans le cas de M. Audet. \u00c0 mon avis, la demande de M. Audet est justifi\u00e9e.\n[123] J'ordonne par cons\u00e9quent au CN de prendre des mesures, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, afin de revoir sa politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement et de s'assurer que les individus et les groupes charg\u00e9s de sa mise en uvre la respectent.\nB. Le retour au travail [124] M. Audet sollicite une ordonnance, suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi, pr\u00e9voyant que le CN le replace dans son poste de serre-frein et chef de train, et apporte les modifications n\u00e9cessaires aux t\u00e2ches de ce poste afin de lui permettre d'ex\u00e9cuter son travail d'une fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire et conforme aux restrictions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es. Il y a des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve selon lesquels d'autres employ\u00e9s dans des situations similaires ont obtenu un accommodement, en particulier un employ\u00e9 de Capreol atteint d'\u00e9pilepsie qui avait obtenu un accommodement par une modification apport\u00e9e aux t\u00e2ches dans son poste qui \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 comme essentiel pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[125] Apr\u00e8s avoir appris que M. Audet avait subi une crise convulsive en septembre 2002, le CN a appliqu\u00e9 automatiquement les lignes directrices de l'ACFC et a relev\u00e9 M. Audet de ses fonctions sans \u00e9valuer son aptitude physique et mentale \u00e0 occuper son poste particulier, comme le pr\u00e9voyaient les lignes directrices de l'ACFC et les directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement du CN. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi \u00e9nonce que le Tribunal, lorsqu'il juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut ordonner \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 d'accorder \u00e0 la victime de l'acte discriminatoire, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte l'a priv\u00e9e.\n[126] Afin de fournir ce redressement dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, M. Audet doit d'abord \u00eatre replac\u00e9 dans son poste. J'ordonne par cons\u00e9quent au CN de replacer M. Audet dans son poste de serre-frein et chef de train, au terminal de Capreol. J'ordonne de plus au CN de coop\u00e9rer pleinement avec M. Audet et son syndicat, les TUT, lors de l'\u00e9valuation individuelle dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 au moment en cause, afin d'\u00e9tablir lesquelles de ses t\u00e2ches, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, devaient \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es pour s'assurer qu'il soit apte \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter son emploi de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire et sans risques pour lui-m\u00eame, pour autrui et sans causer des dommages aux biens et \u00e0 l'environnement.\n[127] Si M. Audet, le CN et le syndicat des TUT \u00e9tablissent qu'il ne peut obtenir un accommodement de cette mani\u00e8re, j'ordonne au CN de coop\u00e9rer pleinement avec M. Audet et le syndicat des TUT pour qu'il puisse obtenir un accommodement, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, dans un autre poste \u00e0 Capreol. Dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il est \u00e9tabli qu'il n'y a aucun tel poste disponible \u00e0 Capreol, alors j'ordonne au CN, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, de coop\u00e9rer avec M. Audet et le syndicat des TUT afin de chercher un accommodement quant \u00e0 un poste appropri\u00e9, ailleurs qu'\u00e0 Capreol.\n[128] \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de tous ces efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en vue de fournir un accommodement, la priorit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre ax\u00e9e sur des postes qui font partie de la m\u00eame unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation que celle de M. Audet.\nC. L'indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire [129] J'ordonne au CN d'indemniser M. Audet, suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, pour toutes les pertes de salaire et d'avantages qu'il a subies depuis que le CN l'a relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions le 12 septembre 2002. Les parties se sont engag\u00e9es lors de l'audience \u00e0 entreprendre des discussions en vue de conclure une entente \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du calcul du montant de cette indemnit\u00e9, dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le Tribunal rendrait une telle ordonnance. Les parties prendront en compte tous les facteurs pertinents, comme les prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 re\u00e7ues par M. Audet au cours de cette p\u00e9riode et tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats applicables sur les sommes lui \u00e9tant dues.\n[130] M. Audet a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des efforts qu'il a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s depuis 2002 pour trouver d'autre travail, pendant qu'il attendait que le CN lui fournisse un accommodement. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il a fait des [traduction] centaines de demandes d'emploi et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u en entrevue \u00e0 des [traduction] douzaines de reprises. On lui demande souvent lors de ces entrevues pourquoi le CN l'a relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions. Lorsqu'il d\u00e9voile que c'est en raison d'une crise \u00e9pileptique, les employeurs le remercient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d'avoir manifest\u00e9 de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour l'emploi qu'ils cherchent \u00e0 pourvoir, mais choisissent de ne pas l'employer. Plus t\u00f4t dans sa carri\u00e8re, M. Audet a obtenu les comp\u00e9tences requises pour travailler en Ontario comme infirmier auxiliaire autoris\u00e9 et comme assistant en soins m\u00e9dicaux d'urgence. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que malgr\u00e9 ces certifications, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de trouver du travail \u00e0 quelque endroit dans la r\u00e9gion de Sudbury.\n[131] \u00c0 mon avis, les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par M. Audet en vue d'att\u00e9nuer ses dommages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 raisonnables, en particulier si on tient compte du fait que le CN ne l'a jamais officiellement cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait raisonnable qu'il s'attende \u00e0 ce que le CN, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses propres directives et politiques, fasse une proposition en vue de lui fournir un accommodement \u00e0 un certain moment apr\u00e8s l'avoir relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions.\n[132] Je donne par cons\u00e9quent aux parties la directive de tenir pour acquis, lors de leurs discussions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du calcul des pertes de salaire et d'avantages subies par M. Audet, que ce dernier s'est acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation d'att\u00e9nuer ses dommages.\nD. L'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral - l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi [133] M. Audet a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'impact \u00e9motionnel qu'il a ressenti du fait que le CN l'avait relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions et du fait que le CN avait omis de lui fournir un accommodement. Son \u00e9pouse, qui est une infirmi\u00e8re autoris\u00e9e, est devenue le soutien financier principal de la famille. Apr\u00e8s que M. Audet eut cess\u00e9 de recevoir des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 occuper un travail \u00e0 plein temps, un travail qui comportait des quarts de travail de douze heures. La famille de M. Audet et de son \u00e9pouse est compos\u00e9e de deux enfants d'\u00e2ge mineur et d'une ni\u00e8ce \u00e2g\u00e9e de 16 ans dont ils s'occupent. La pression que l'\u00e9pouse de M. Audet subissait du fait d'avoir \u00e0 assurer le soutien financier de la famille par elle-m\u00eame a mis leur mariage [traduction] \u00e0 rude \u00e9preuve. Il a eu besoin de suivre des s\u00e9ances avec un [traduction] conseiller. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du fait qu'il ressentait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que le CN eut refus\u00e9 de lui donner du travail. Cela a diminu\u00e9 son estime de lui et l'a fait sentir comme un [traduction] moins que rien. En prenant en compte toutes ces circonstances, j'ordonne au CN de payer \u00e0 M. Audet une indemnit\u00e9 de 10 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\n[134] M. Audet pr\u00e9tend que la crise convulsive qu'il a subie le 10 septembre 2002 a \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e par une charge de travail excessive, pour laquelle il bl\u00e2me le CN. L'avocat de M. Audet pr\u00e9tendait que l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral devrait \u00eatre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e afin que ce facteur soit pris en compte. Je ne partage pas son opinion.\n[135] D'abord, je ne comprends pas pourquoi le pr\u00e9judice moral subi par M. Audet devrait \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente, selon que la crise convulsive a \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e ou non. Il m'appara\u00eet que l'\u00e9valuation objective d'un pr\u00e9judice moral ne devrait pas \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e du fait du caract\u00e8re soi-disant r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible du comportement de l'intim\u00e9.\n[136] En outre, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, je ne suis pas convaincu, compte tenu de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lors de l'audience, que la crise convulsive a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e. Aucun expert m\u00e9dical n'a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, mais des photocopies de rapports pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par divers m\u00e9decins, qui concluaient tant\u00f4t que la crise avait \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e, tant\u00f4t que la crise n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies par M. Audet et le CN. Il importe de noter que bien que la pression de la charge de travail semble avoir oblig\u00e9 M. Audet \u00e0 prendre un cong\u00e9 de 96 heures en juin 2002, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que la charge de travail dans les mois qui ont suivi a \u00e9t\u00e9 exceptionnelle. En outre, le Dr Remillard et le Dr Lapierre ont mentionn\u00e9 que les trois crises convulsives subies par M. Audet de 9 \u00e0 14 mois apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions sembleraient du moins jeter un certain doute quant \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle la crise convulsive a \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e. En prenant en compte tous ces facteurs, je ne suis pas convaincu que la crise convulsive survenue le 10 septembre 2002 a \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e.\nE. L'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale - le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi [137] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ \u00e0 une victime d'un acte discriminatoire si l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. L'avocat de M. Audet a pr\u00e9tendu que le CN a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] compl\u00e8tement inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Il a mentionn\u00e9 le manque [traduction] incroyable de communication entre les divers services, l'[traduction] absence totale de direction, et l'omission d'avoir fait participer M. Audet et le syndicat des TUT au processus d'accommodement, comme le d\u00e9montre la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui de la pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il a en outre mentionn\u00e9 le fait que la CN a attendu quinze mois avant de d\u00e9ployer quelque effort pour lui fournir un accommodement et que, au cours d'une p\u00e9riode de trois ans, seulement deux offres d'emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. M. Audet n'avait pas les comp\u00e9tences requises quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re offre d'emploi, pour un poste de commis au mouvement des trains, parce qu'il n'avait pas de permis de conduire. La deuxi\u00e8me offre d'emploi a essentiellement \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e par le CN au cours de l'audience. M. Audet demande qu'il soit ordonn\u00e9 que le CN paie l'indemnit\u00e9 maximale pr\u00e9vue suivant ce paragraphe.\n[138] Je partage l'opinion selon laquelle le comportement du CN dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Il est clair que le CN \u00e9tait au fait de son obligation de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s souffrant d'une d\u00e9ficience. Le CN a adopt\u00e9 une politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement sous la forme des directives quant \u00e0 l'accommodement qui \u00e9noncent les proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 suivre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tout employ\u00e9 qui a des besoins sp\u00e9ciaux qui requi\u00e8rent un accommodement. Toutefois, les personnes qui au CN \u00e9taient charg\u00e9es de la gestion du cas de M. Audet n'ont pas tenu compte des responsabilit\u00e9s qui leur incombaient suivant la politique et n'ont pas fait d'efforts en vue de lui fournir un accommodement pendant des mois et des mois, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que finalement il ait forc\u00e9 le CN \u00e0 agir en d\u00e9posant sa plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Le CN, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 que son comportement faisait l'objet d'un examen suivant la Loi, a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 des efforts d'accommodement qui \u00e9taient toujours, au mieux, de maigres efforts. Cette ligne de conduite \u00e9tait, \u00e0 mon avis, inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[139] Dans les circonstances, j'ordonne au CN de payer \u00e0 M. Audet une indemnit\u00e9 de 10 000 $, suivant le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\nF. Les d\u00e9pens [140] M. Audet demande que ses d\u00e9pens lui soient adjug\u00e9s, sur la base avocat-client ou subsidiairement selon l'\u00e9chelle de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il fonde principalement sa demande sur les conclusions tir\u00e9es par le Tribunal dans deux d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes, \u00e0 savoir : Brown c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 24, et Brooks c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans), 2005 TCDP 14. Les deux d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vue d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Au moment de l'audience \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'avait pas encore rendu un jugement dans l'une ou l'autre de ces affaires.\n[141] Apr\u00e8s la fin de l'audience, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Brown, le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2005 (2005 CF 1683), et plus r\u00e9cemment dans l'affaire Brooks, le 21 avril 2006 (2006 CF 500). Dans les deux cas, la Cour a annul\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal.\n[142] L'avocat de M. Audet a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9, au cours de ses observations finales, que la d\u00e9cision se rapportant \u00e0 la question des d\u00e9pens soit report\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les contr\u00f4les judiciaires des d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal aient \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9s. \u00c0 mon avis, c'est l\u00e0 une fa\u00e7on judicieuse d'agir. Compte tenu de l'issue des contr\u00f4les judiciaires, des observations additionnelles des parties seront accept\u00e9es avec plaisir. Afin de r\u00e9duire les d\u00e9lais, j'ai rendu ma d\u00e9cision, dans la mesure du possible. Les parties sont invit\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal, \u00e0 leur convenance, toute observation de suivi. Comme je le mentionne ci-apr\u00e8s, je demeure saisi de l'affaire pour traiter de toutes les questions de redressement qui pourront survenir par la suite, y compris de la question des d\u00e9pens ou frais.\n[143] Entre-temps, comme l'avocat de M. Audet avait \u00e9galement sugg\u00e9r\u00e9, la demande \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des d\u00e9pens pourrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de sujet de discussion entre les parties, comme le calcul des pertes de salaire et d'avantages.\nG. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [144] L'int\u00e9r\u00eat est payable \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision (paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi).

Introduction [1] Dans la plainte dont je suis saisi, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la Commission de la capitale nationale (CCN) a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Bob Brown en lui refusant [Traduction] l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services en ne prenant aucune mesure d\u2019accommodement pour composer avec sa d\u00e9ficience (personne en fauteuil roulant), et ce, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). La pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination se poursuit toujours.\n[2] Le service auquel il est fait allusion dans la plainte sont les marches de la rue York, lesquelles sont situ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intersection de la rue York et de la promenade Sussex, \u00e0 Ottawa. Les travaux de construction des marches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 achev\u00e9s en 1999. M. Brown pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elles ne sont pas accessibles. M. Brown et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (CCDP) pr\u00e9tendent que les personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches ne peuvent pas se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019avenue Mackenzie, laquelle est situ\u00e9e au sommet des marches, \u00e0 partir de la promenade Sussex, laquelle est situ\u00e9e au bas des marches.\n[3] On est all\u00e9 examiner le site au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. J\u2019ai annex\u00e9 un plan des rues ainsi qu\u2019un certain nombre de photos afin de permettre aux lecteurs de mieux comprendre le lieu g\u00e9ographique ainsi que la pr\u00e9sentation des marches. Il y a un croisement en T \u00e0 la promenade Sussex : la rue York se termine par un escalier abrupt qui peut \u00eatre emprunt\u00e9 par les personnes qui sont capables de monter les marches pour se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019avenue Mackenzie et au parc Major. La tour de la Paix et l\u2019aiguille de la biblioth\u00e8que du Parlement sont visibles depuis la rue York. Un observateur peut voir les \u00e9cluses du canal Rideau qui descendent vers la rivi\u00e8re Outaouais et peut \u00e9galement voir la Colline parlementaire, laquelle est situ\u00e9e de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019un ravin. Les hauteurs de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 sont impressionnantes.\n[4] L\u2019une des raisons pour laquelle les gens peuvent vouloir emprunter les marches est qu\u2019il y a un belv\u00e9d\u00e8re dans le parc Major. J\u2019affirme cela parce que la situation a \u00e9volu\u00e9 depuis la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte et que les arguments du plaignant et de la Commission reposent maintenant principalement sur l\u2019utilisation du parc. Les pr\u00e9cisions initiales mentionnent que les marches constituent [Traduction] une voie de passage entre les \u00e9difices du Parlement et le march\u00e9 By. Cette situation a pu changer car un autre escalier ainsi qu\u2019un ascenseur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construits un peu plus loin sur la rue, sur le site Daly, pr\u00e8s des marches de la rue York. Selon certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, ces installations permettraient de se rendre plus facilement de la Colline parlementaire au march\u00e9 By.\n[5] Je dois \u00e9galement dire quelque chose \u00e0 propos de la Commission de la capitale nationale. La CCN est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat dont le mandat est pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi sur la capitale nationale. Cette loi donne \u00e0 la CCN la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019am\u00e9nagement, de la conservation et de l\u2019embellissement de la r\u00e9gion de la capitale nationale. La preuve indique que les marches de la rue York sont situ\u00e9es sur un terrain appartenant \u00e0 la Couronne, mais administr\u00e9 par la CCN. La CCN est responsable de la construction et de l\u2019entretien des marches.\n[6] La CCN est responsable du secteur et a insist\u00e9 pour qu\u2019un ascenseur soit install\u00e9 sur le site Daly, lequel est situ\u00e9 un peu plus bas sur la promenade Sussex. Le v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9bat entre les parties consiste \u00e0 savoir si ce genre d\u2019accommodement est suffisant. M. Brown et la CCDP affirment que non. Ils sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter qu\u2019on installe un ascenseur juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du site; mais pr\u00e9tendent que l\u2019ascenseur du site Daly est situ\u00e9 trop loin. Ils pr\u00e9tendent \u00e9galement que le d\u00e9faut de fournir un acc\u00e8s aux marches constitue un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Brown et des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\n[7] L\u2019audition de la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9e par une demande de la part de la CCDP d\u2019ajouter Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada (Travaux publics) comme partie. Cette demande a d\u00e9coul\u00e9 du fait que M. Rapson, l\u2019expert appel\u00e9 par la CCDP, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le puits d\u2019ascenseur situ\u00e9 dans l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 bureaux adjacent aux marches pourrait servir d\u2019acc\u00e8s. Cet immeuble \u00e0 bureaux est connu sous le nom d\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Il est actuellement occup\u00e9 par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada en vertu d\u2019un permis d\u2019occupation accord\u00e9 par Travaux publics, lequel s\u2019occupe de l\u2019entretien, de la gestion et de la surveillance de l\u2019\u00e9difice pour le compte de l\u2019\u00c9tat. La demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie.\n[8] La pr\u00e9sente cause soul\u00e8ve de nombreuses questions juridiques qui ont trait aux responsabilit\u00e9s de la CCN et de certaines autres entit\u00e9s publiques dans le domaine de l\u2019accommodement. Il doit exister de nombreux sites o\u00f9 des probl\u00e8mes semblables se posent. La pr\u00e9sente cause soul\u00e8ve \u00e9galement une question plus \u00e9troite quant \u00e0 l\u2019obligation des intim\u00e9s, comme la CCN, de consulter les personnes qui ont besoin d\u2019accommodement. Bien que cela m\u00e8ne \u00e0 une discussion de questions plus vastes, chaque cause est un cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je me suis donc limit\u00e9 aux faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause.\n[9] La d\u00e9cision qui suit porte essentiellement sur la question de la responsabilit\u00e9. J\u2019ai convenu que je ne traiterais des diff\u00e9rentes mesures d\u2019accommodement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9es en rapport avec les marches de la rue York que si cela devenait n\u00e9cessaire.\nII. Les faits A. Les t\u00e9moignages du plaignant et de la CCDP (i) Bob Brown [10] M. Brown est t\u00e9trapl\u00e9gique depuis 1972. Il aime faire des choses par lui\u2011m\u00eame et tire fiert\u00e9 de son ind\u00e9pendance. M. Brown vit actuellement sur la rue Murray, \u00e0 trois p\u00e2t\u00e9s de maisons des marches de la rue York. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il aime se rendre au parc Major.\n[11] D\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, M. Brown a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que de nombreux festivals ont lieu au parc Major. Il a toutefois chang\u00e9 son point de vue lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9e a corrig\u00e9 cette affirmation.\n[Traduction]\nM. Harnden : Si je me souviens bien, vous avez soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait important que vous puissiez avoir acc\u00e8s au parc pour pouvoir assister \u00e0 des festivals. Retirez\u2011vous ce que vous avez dit en ce qui concerne la raison principale pour laquelle vous d\u00e9sirez avoir acc\u00e8s au parc?\nR. Non, ce que je dis c\u2019est que ce n\u2019est pas seulement pour assister \u00e0 des festivals. Les gens se rendent au parc pour assister \u00e0 des festivals, mais parfois ils s\u2019y rendent en revenant du march\u00e9. C\u2019est tout simplement un beau parc o\u00f9 on peut aller. Vous montez et le parc surplombe la rivi\u00e8re des Outaouais. C\u2019est un site historique. Il y a des bancs. Les gens s\u2019y rendent comme \u00e7a le soir, juste pour le plaisir de se trouver dans un espace vert.\nM. Brown a plus tard affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un bel endroit pour aller regarder le coucher du soleil.\n[12] Les \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la plainte sont toutefois de nature plus politique. En 1998, lorsque les marches \u00e9taient en construction, M. Brown \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 consultatif sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 de la ville d\u2019Ottawa. Bien que la CCN ne soit pas soumise au processus de planification municipal parce qu\u2019elle rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la proposition de construction des marches a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention du Comit\u00e9 consultatif. Le Comit\u00e9 a discut\u00e9 de la proposition et a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait lieu de s\u2019inqui\u00e9ter.\n[13] En tant que pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9, M. Brown a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 M. Jim Watson, le maire de la ville d\u2019Ottawa \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de cette lettre commence par la phrase suivante : [Traduction] Nous, les membres du Comit\u00e9, pr\u00e9tendent \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 que la conception des nouvelles marches est tout \u00e0 fait inacceptable car elle comporte les m\u00eames obstacles architecturaux que nous tentons d\u2019\u00e9liminer depuis des d\u00e9cennies. Le Comit\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 au maire d\u2019organiser une rencontre avec M. Beaudry, le pr\u00e9sident de la CCN, pour r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me du manque d\u2019acc\u00e8s au site.\n[14] M. Brown croyait que le maire avait \u00e9crit \u00e0 la CCN, comme il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9, et il a demand\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019une rencontre. Il semble toutefois que la CCN n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u cette lettre et la preuve dont je suis saisi donne \u00e0 penser que la lettre n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e. La question des marches est n\u00e9anmoins devenue une controverse publique, en partie en raison d\u2019une lettre que M. Brown a envoy\u00e9e au Ottawa Citizen.\n[15] L\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine est situ\u00e9e juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des marches, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord du quadrilat\u00e8re. Le Comit\u00e9 a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 une personne \u00e0 l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine dans laquelle il mentionnait que les marches qu\u2019on projetait de construire ne respecteraient pas les exigences de l\u2019Americans with Disabilities Act. L\u2019ambassade d\u00e9frayait apparemment le co\u00fbt de la conception des marches. L\u2019agent d\u2019administration de l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine a r\u00e9pondu que c\u2019\u00e9tait la CCN qui poss\u00e9dait la comp\u00e9tence ultime de d\u00e9cider ce qui serait construit sur le site. La seule pr\u00e9occupation de l\u2019ambassade \u00e9tait que le style des marches se marie bien avec le style de l\u2019ambassade.\n[16] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la controverse, la CCN a organis\u00e9, le 17 mars 1999, une rencontre avec le comit\u00e9 sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 des Ressources communautaires pour personne ayant un handicap afin de discuter de la situation. La r\u00e9union fut tenue \u00e0 huis clos. Il y a eu d\u00e9saccord entre les parties quant \u00e0 savoir si le comit\u00e9 sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait l\u2019organisme qu\u2019il convenait de consulter. On a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brown la permission d\u2019assister \u00e0 la r\u00e9union \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019il ne discute pas du contenu de la r\u00e9union avec le Comit\u00e9 consultatif sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e2illonn\u00e9.\n[17] M. Brown a affirm\u00e9 que la CCN s\u2019\u00e9tait servie de la r\u00e9union pour expliquer ses plans quant au site Daly, lesquels plans visaient \u00e0 fournir un acc\u00e8s entre la promenade Sussex et l\u2019avenue MacKenzie. Cela ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux pr\u00e9occupations de M. Brown. Il a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il n'allait nulle part et il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte le 31 ao\u00fbt 1999. Cela s\u2019est pass\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que les marches furent construites. La CCDP a fait une enqu\u00eate qui a dur\u00e9 tr\u00e8s longtemps.\n[18] Les parties ont tenu de longues discussions et la CCN a \u00e9ventuellement tenu une autre r\u00e9union le 23 juillet 2002 afin de discuter des solutions de rechange. Les participants \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union comprenaient des repr\u00e9sentants du Comit\u00e9 consultatif de la ville d\u2019Ottawa. M. Brown n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9. Selon lui, la CCN avait pris sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but et ne d\u00e9sirait examiner rien d\u2019autre que la solution du site Daly. Selon lui, la r\u00e9union n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019une mise en sc\u00e8ne.\n[19] Malgr\u00e9 ses efforts, la CCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de r\u00e9gler la question et la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. La position de M. Brown et de la CCDP lors de l\u2019audience \u00e9tait relativement simple. Les marches de la rue York ne sont pas accessibles. Elles ne comportent aucune mesure d\u2019accommodement. Une personne en fauteuil roulant qui se trouve au bas des marches ne dispose d\u2019aucun moyen pour les monter. Cette situation est discriminatoire. Le site Daly constitue un parcours de rechange dans le secteur mais il ne permet pas d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux marches.\n[20] M. Brown dispose de deux choix lorsqu\u2019il se trouve au bas des marches. Il peut tourner \u00e0 droite et emprunter le long chemin qui fait le tour de l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine, ce qui l\u2019emm\u00e8ne au coin nord\u2011est du parc. Il peut tourner \u00e0 gauche et emprunter le site Daly. Dans l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre direction, la distance constitue un probl\u00e8me. La pente est particuli\u00e8rement difficile \u00e0 monter pour une personne qui utilise un fauteuil roulant \u00e0 commande manuelle.\n[21] La plainte fondamentale de M. Brown est toutefois plus simple. Il s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation du site Daly parce que cela oblige les personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches \u00e0 se rendre ailleurs. Cela a pour effet de s\u00e9parer les gens.\n[Traduction]\nM. Brown : Mon principal probl\u00e8me est que, en raison de la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation, le degr\u00e9 d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas \u00e9gal. Je dois me s\u00e9parer des gens avec qui je d\u00e9ambule pour me rendre \u00e0 l\u2019autre niveau, au sommet [\u2026]\nMon plus grand probl\u00e8me est la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation.\nM. Brown affirme qu\u2019il devrait avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de se rendre au sommet des marches \u00e0 partir du bas des marches. Le site devrait \u00eatre dot\u00e9 d\u2019une mesure d\u2019accommodement.\n[22] M. Brown a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le retard occasionn\u00e9 par l\u2019utilisation des autres parcours fait en sorte que la personne qui l\u2019attend au sommet des marches se lasse d\u2019attendre et s\u2019en va.\n[Traduction]\nSi je d\u00e9ambule, par exemple, avec des personnes, la nature humaine \u00e9tant ce qu\u2019elle est \u2013 monter, par exemple, la rue York \u2013 la nature humaine \u00e9tant ce qu\u2019elle est, d\u2019ordinaire les autres personnes empruntent le chemin le plus facile, ou le chemin le plus court. La plupart du temps, elles pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent monter les marches et je dois me rendre \u00e0 un autre endroit pour aller ensuite les rejoindre au sommet des marches.\nJe me trouve donc exclu de mon groupe. On me fait sentir que je suis diff\u00e9rent et je me sens vraiment diff\u00e9rent d\u2019avoir \u00e0 faire cela.\nN\u2019importe quelle personne qui accompagne M. Brown se sentirait d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9e de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re.\n[23] Ce probl\u00e8me soul\u00e8ve une question de dignit\u00e9.\n[Traduction]\nM. Brown : J\u2019estime que je devrais jouir de la m\u00eame possibilit\u00e9 que les autres citoyens d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s au m\u00eame endroit \u2013 au m\u00eame site, ou \u00e0 un endroit tr\u00e8s proche -- avoisinant \u2013 comme mesure d\u2019accommodement raisonnable. Selon moi, le fait de devoir se rendre \u00e0 un autre endroit ne constitue pas une mesure d\u2019accommodement raisonnable.\nSi je me trouve avec d\u2019autres personnes, cela porte atteinte \u00e0 ma dignit\u00e9. On me donne le sentiment que je suis un citoyen de seconde classe parce que je ne peux pas me servir de la m\u00eame installation que les autres citoyens canadiens.\nNous sommes dans la capitale nationale du Canada. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un endroit symbolique.\nM. Brown estime que la situation actuelle est discriminatoire. Ses inqui\u00e9tudes s\u2019\u00e9tendent \u00e9galement aux personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es, aux personnes qui transportent des enfants dans des poussettes et \u00e0 quiconque \u00e9prouve de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 monter les marches.\n[24] La solution propos\u00e9e par M. Brown est simple. Il estime qu\u2019on devrait installer un ascenseur au bas des marches. Si cette solution n\u2019est pas possible, il croit que l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du site serait une solution acceptable, dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019ascenseur est visible \u00e0 partir du bas des marches. M. Brown \u00e9tait donc dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019utiliser l\u2019ascenseur qui est situ\u00e9 sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught.\n(ii) David Lloyd Rapson [25] David Lloyd Rapson a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 par la Commission comme t\u00e9moin expert en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 et de conception universelle. Ses services ont initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus en octobre 2000 et il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner un certain nombre de solutions de rechange. L\u2019une de ces solutions \u00e9tait la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser d\u2019autres lieux.\n[26] M. Rapson poss\u00e8de des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re d\u2019urbanisme. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la technologie de l\u2019architecture et il a re\u00e7u une formation en \u00e9valuation de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. Il poss\u00e8de une grande exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement. Il a fait du travail de comit\u00e9 pour l\u2019Association canadienne de normalisation et a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction d\u2019un manuel portant sur les meilleures pratiques en mati\u00e8re de conception universelle.\n[27] M. Rapson a travaill\u00e9 comme directeur adjoint \u00e0 la Universal Design Institute de l\u2019universit\u00e9 du Manitoba. Il a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 un comit\u00e9 consultatif sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 pour la ville de Winnipeg et il a dirig\u00e9 une \u00e9quipe compos\u00e9e de quinze personnes dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019une v\u00e9rification en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 au centre\u2011ville de Winnipeg. Je devrais \u00e9galement mentionner que M. Rapson s\u2019est cass\u00e9 les reins en 1993, et qu\u2019il \u00e9prouve certains probl\u00e8mes avec ses jambes. Il se sert d\u2019une cane et, par cons\u00e9quent, son opinion d\u2019expert repose sur certaines de ses exp\u00e9riences personnelles.\n[28] M. Rapson a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que beaucoup de travail a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fait afin d\u2019\u00e9laborer un ensemble de crit\u00e8res qui peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s dans le cadre des \u00e9valuations en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. On assiste \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mergence d\u2019une discipline dans le domaine de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. Cette discipline comprend toute une s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019ordre physique, psychologique, sociologique et d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Un certain nombre de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ont trait au processus qui est utilis\u00e9 dans la planification, la conception et la construction de sites accessibles.\n[29] Les crit\u00e8res fondamentaux utilis\u00e9s dans le cadre de ces \u00e9valuations en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 se trouvent dans les principes de la conception universelle. M. Rapson a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 ces crit\u00e8res comme \u00e9tant des lignes directrices, malgr\u00e9 que cette expression semble un peu trop stricte. Ces crit\u00e8res sont plut\u00f4t l\u2019affirmation d\u2019un id\u00e9al et ils sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement invoqu\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de planification, de conception et d\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019environnements physiques libres d\u2019obstacles. Le mot obstacle d\u00e9signe toute chose qui peut emp\u00eacher une personne d\u2019utiliser un environnement physique. J\u2019ai annex\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019annexe B, la formulation qu\u2019a faite M. Rapson des principes de la conception universelle.\n[30] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Rapson a fait une distinction entre accessibilit\u00e9 et conception universelle.\n[Traduction]\nR. L\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 d\u00e9pend des r\u00e8gles ou des crit\u00e8res qui \u00e9tablissent un niveau minimum de conception n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\nPar exemple, la majorit\u00e9 des codes du b\u00e2timent \u2013 le code national du b\u00e2timent, le code du b\u00e2timent de l\u2019Ontario, le code du b\u00e2timent du Manitoba \u2013 mentionnent d\u2019ordinaire les exigences minimales. Il s\u2019agit du minimum en mati\u00e8re de conception. La conception universelle est plus un art et une pratique de la conception visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du plus grand nombre de personnes pendant la dur\u00e9e de leur vie.\nLes principes de la conception universelle pr\u00e9voient le cadre plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans lequel des questions pr\u00e9cises d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es.\n[31] La question de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 comporte un volet juridique et un volet technique. M. Rapson a d\u00e9crit sa t\u00e2che en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n[Traduction]\nR. Il y avait deux questions fondamentales : une opinion d\u2019expert quant \u00e0 savoir comment le lieu pouvait \u00eatre rendu plus accessible aux personnes en fauteuil roulant; poss\u00e9der suffisamment de renseignements pour permettre \u00e0 la CCDP de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a satisfait \u00e0 son obligation juridique de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des personnes en fauteuil roulant sans subir de contrainte excessive.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me question pose une difficult\u00e9. La question sous\u2011jacente, \u00e0 tout le moins, consiste \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a satisfait \u00e0 son obligation de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience pr\u00e9vue dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le Tribunal doit se prononcer sur cette question. Ce serait une erreur que d\u2019accepter les opinions de M. Rapson comme \u00e9tant des opinions juridiques.\n[32] M. Rapson avait droit, en tant qu\u2019expert en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 et de conception universelle, de parler de l\u2019aspect technique de la question. Il n\u2019y a pas grand chose que l\u2019on puisse dire dans ce contexte. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 le fait que les marches, telles qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 initialement construites, ne sont pas accessibles. Elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ues dans le respect des principes de la conception universelle et ne satisfont pas aux normes actuelles. La question en litige consiste \u00e0 savoir si la CCN a corrig\u00e9 la situation.\n[33] Selon M. Rapson, les marches de la rue York ne respectent pas les principes de la conception universelle. Selon lui, les marches ne sont pas accessibles. L\u2019ascenseur du site Daly ne corrige pas la situation. D\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, j\u2019ai accept\u00e9 l\u2019opinion de M. Rapson sur ces questions. J\u2019ai estim\u00e9 que son t\u00e9moignage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi et mesur\u00e9. Il a compris qu\u2019il fallait faire des compromis raisonnables.\n(a) Les rapports de M. Rapson [34] M. Rapson a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 deux rapports. Le premier rapport est dat\u00e9 du 14 juin 2001 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9 par le fait que M. Rapson n\u2019avait re\u00e7u aucun financement pour visiter le site. Je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une erreur de jugement de la part de la CCDP, laquelle prenait vraiment un risque en demandant \u00e0 M. Rapson de r\u00e9diger un rapport sans proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen physique du site. J\u2019accepte n\u00e9anmoins que les lacunes qui figuraient dans le rapport initial ont \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9es avant la tenue de l\u2019audience.\n[35] M. Rapson avait en sa possession une s\u00e9rie de photographies qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises sur le site. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 des coll\u00e8gues d\u2019inspecter le site pour lui. Il a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 diverses personnes et [Traduction] a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir le plus de renseignements possible. C\u2019est gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 de l\u2019\u00e9change de courrier, \u00e0 des plans de site et \u00e0 d\u2019autres documents qu\u2019il a pu recueillir des renseignements.\n[36] Le premier rapport conclut que la conception des marches viole trois des principes directeurs de la conception universelle : l\u2019utilisation \u00e9quitable, l\u2019utilisation souple et un faible effort physique \u00e0 faire. La conception des marches enfreint les principes de la conception universelle. Les parcours de rechange \u00e9taient [Traduction] tr\u00e8s longs. Il y a \u00e9galement eu des probl\u00e8mes avec le [Traduction] processus de consultation adopt\u00e9 en 1994.\n[37] M. Rapson a n\u00e9anmoins reconnu que le site posait de nombreux probl\u00e8mes. La pente \u00e9tait trop abrupte pour permettre la construction d\u2019une rampe utilisable et la construction d\u2019un [Traduction] syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9vation ext\u00e9rieur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas opportune. Il a par cons\u00e9quent propos\u00e9 sa propre solution de rechange. M. Rapson croyait que la solution [Traduction] \u00e9vidente consistait \u00e0 utiliser l\u2019ascenseur situ\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught, lequel \u00e9difice est situ\u00e9 juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des marches. Il a estim\u00e9 que le processus de consultation que la CCN avait tenu avec les occupants de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assez englobant. Je souscris \u00e0 cette conclusion.\n[38] Le deuxi\u00e8me rapport \u00e9manant de M. Rapson est essentiellement une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une \u00e9tude d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 universelle pr\u00e9par\u00e9e pour le compte de l\u2019intim\u00e9e par Robertson Martin en juillet 2002. Il comprend les conclusions d\u00e9finitives de M. Rapson. Il existe un certain nombre de diff\u00e9rences entre les deux rapports, mais je crois qu\u2019il est plus important de concentrer notre attention sur le t\u00e9moignage de M. Rapson, lequel suivait les grandes lignes du deuxi\u00e8me rapport.\n[39] M. Rapson a fait des enqu\u00eates additionnelles apr\u00e8s avoir produit son deuxi\u00e8me rapport et apr\u00e8s \u00eatre all\u00e9 inspecter les marches \u00e0 trois ou quatre reprises. Il a mesur\u00e9 le temps qu'il en prenait pour effectuer les divers parcours autour des marches. Selon lui, le parcours permettant de se rendre au sommet des marches, en passant par le site Daly, ou le parcours qui fait le tour de l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine prenaient environ de six \u00e0 huit minutes.\n[40] M. Rapson a \u00e9galement observ\u00e9 la circulation pi\u00e9tonni\u00e8re.\n[Traduction]\nM. Rapson : Il y avait un flux continu de personnes qui montaient et descendaient les marches.\nJ\u2019ai compt\u00e9 pendant huit minutes et mon compte s\u2019est \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 85 personnes, ou quelque chose comme \u00e7a, de diff\u00e9rents \u00e2ges, de diff\u00e9rentes tailles \u2013 des familles, des personnes seules.\nJ\u2019ai vu une famille avec une poussette dans laquelle \u00e9tait assis un jeune enfant, et la poussette faisait des bonds en descendant.\nJ\u2019ai vu un certain nombre de scooters circuler au bas des marches.\nIl y avait une jeune famille, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, avec une poussette, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas capable de monter les marches et qui a d\u00fb faire le tour. Ce fut la m\u00eame chose pour une personne \u00e2g\u00e9e qui se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait en fauteuil roulant pouss\u00e9 par une personne.\nQ. Vous avez mentionn\u00e9 que des personnes \u00e9taient incapables de monter les marches. Ont\u2011elles tent\u00e9 de --\nR. Elles tentaient de trouver une fa\u00e7on de monter pour se rendre au parc. Elles se trouvaient en bas, au March\u00e9 By.\nLa question est tout simplement que les marches repr\u00e9sentent un obstacle pour un grand nombre de personnes.\n[41] M. Rapson a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019on aurait tort d\u2019examiner le site uniquement du point de vue d\u2019une personne qui se d\u00e9place en fauteuil roulant. Selon lui, il faut pendre en compte le cas de toute personne qui est incapable de monter l\u2019escalier. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de solution parfaite. La solution qui convient le mieux aux besoins d\u2019un utilisateur peut ne pas r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019un autre utilisateur.\n(b) Les conclusions de M. Rapson [42] La principale conclusion de M. Rapson \u00e9tait que la conception initiale des marches de la rue York contrevient aux principes de la conception universelle. Les marches ne sont pas accessibles. Les parcours de rechange sont tr\u00e8s longs. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019une question de remise \u00e0 niveau d\u2019une conception inad\u00e9quate. Cela pose toujours probl\u00e8me.\n[43] Certaines des critiques de M. Rapson avaient trait au manque de consultation. Il a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019un processus de consultation ad\u00e9quat aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre tenu en 1994, au moment de la conception des marches. Il a souscrit \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019architecte de l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine qui aurait affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une [Traduction] occasion manqu\u00e9e. Je ne r\u00e9p\u00e8te cette remarque que parce qu\u2019elle refl\u00e8te bien l\u2019opinion de M. Rapson.\n[44] M. Rapson \u00e9tait fermement d\u2019avis que les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience, le public, et toute partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e auraient d\u00fb avoir leur mot \u00e0 dire quant \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec le site. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un aspect fondamental de la conception universelle et la CCN n\u2019en a pas assez fait \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Les personnes qui ont particip\u00e9 aux r\u00e9unions qui ont eu lieu n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es quant \u00e0 toutes les solutions de rechange possibles. Elles ont essentiellement \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9es de faire un choix parmi les solutions de rechange pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les architectes.\n[45] Il ne s\u2019agissait pas non plus de r\u00e9gler uniquement le cas des personnes qui ont des probl\u00e8mes de mobilit\u00e9. La conception d\u00e9finitive devrait r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des personnes qui ont des probl\u00e8mes visuels, auditifs et cognitifs; elle devrait r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de personnes de diff\u00e9rentes tailles, de diff\u00e9rentes grosseurs et de diff\u00e9rents \u00e2ges. Elle devrait r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des parents qui ont des enfants en poussette. M. Rapson a recommand\u00e9 une [Traduction] strat\u00e9gie de signalisation. Des bancs et des haltes de repos devraient \u00eatre install\u00e9s dans le secteur.\n[46] La CCN a ru\u00e9 dans les brancards \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019elle ne souscrivait pas aux principes de la conception universelle. M. Rapson s\u2019est quelque peu ravis\u00e9 en contre\u2011interrogatoire et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait consult\u00e9 la publication Accessibilit\u00e9 des parcs et espaces ouverts: guide d'am\u00e9nagement de la CCN lorsqu\u2019il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ses rapports. Il a convenu que ce manuel attestait d\u2019une bonne volont\u00e9. Sa position n\u2019a cependant pas chang\u00e9. La conception des marches contrevient aux principes de la conception universelle.\n[47] M. Rapson \u00e9tait conscient des d\u00e9fis que pr\u00e9sentait le site. La colline \u00e9tait haute et abrupte. Le site \u00e9tait \u00e9troit : il \u00e9tait trop \u00e9troit pour que l\u2019on puisse construire un escalier et un syst\u00e8me de rampe ad\u00e9quat. L\u2019installation d\u2019une plate\u2011forme monte escalier n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une solution opportune. L\u2019exposition aux intemp\u00e9ries constituait \u00e9galement un probl\u00e8me. La sociologie du secteur devait \u00e9galement \u00eatre pris en compte. Il y a des \u00e9l\u00e9ments durs dans le quartier. Les personnes qui utilisent un ascenseur peuvent craindre avec raison d\u2019emprunter un passage qui n\u2019est pas \u00e0 la vue du public.\n[48] Des facteurs historiques et culturels doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre pris en compte. M. Rapson a d\u00e9crit Ottawa comme \u00e9tant le mod\u00e8le du Canada. Ce facteur doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre pris en compte. Il y a \u00e9galement le fait que l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine est situ\u00e9e juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des marches. Le co\u00fbt de tout ajustement doit \u00eatre pris en compte, comme d\u2019ailleurs les questions d\u2019ing\u00e9nierie et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il faut \u00e9tablir un juste \u00e9quilibre entre les int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s.\n[49] Le deuxi\u00e8me rapport examine les solutions de rechange mentionn\u00e9es dans le rapport Robertson. M. Rapson a ajout\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught comme solution de rechange. La premi\u00e8re solution de rechange envisag\u00e9e dans le rapport Robertson \u00e9tait le status quo. Cette solution \u00e9tait inacceptable. La solution de rechange no 2, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire l\u2019installation d\u2019une plate\u2011forme monte escalier, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9alisable. La plate\u2011forme serait situ\u00e9e en plein air et serait ainsi expos\u00e9e aux intemp\u00e9ries. Ce serait encombrant car il faudrait installer deux \u00e9l\u00e9vateurs. Le fonctionnement manuel de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9vateur constituerait un probl\u00e8me pour les personnes ayant des d\u00e9ficiences.\n[50] La solution de rechange no 3 consistait en l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. L\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught poss\u00e9dait un acc\u00e8s de plein\u2011pied au niveau du sol ainsi que plus haut, sur l\u2019avenue MacKenzie. Il y avait une rampe d\u2019acc\u00e8s juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des marches de la rue York. Le premier rapport de M. Rapson laisse entendre que les entr\u00e9es, les sorties et l\u2019ascenseur existants pourraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s. Le deuxi\u00e8me rapport laisse entendre que l\u2019on devrait construire un nouvel ascenseur. Il y avait un puits d\u2019ascenseur situ\u00e9 \u00e0 la rampe d\u2019acc\u00e8s. Il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 de la meilleure solution de rechange. On devrait installer un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un bouton\u2011poussoir et faire des mises \u00e0 niveau dans l\u2019\u00e9difice afin de r\u00e9pondre aux normes d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 actuelles.\n[51] Je crois que les intim\u00e9s ont trop insist\u00e9 sur le fait que M. Rapson ne s\u2019est jamais rendu \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Il poss\u00e9dait le plan d\u2019\u00e9tage et si l\u2019affaire n\u2019est pas all\u00e9e plus loin que \u00e7a, c\u2019\u00e9tait parce que les intim\u00e9s n\u2019y tenaient pas. M. Rapson recommandait tout simplement que l\u2019on tienne compte de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Il a admis qu\u2019il pouvait y avoir des probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui feraient en sorte que l\u2019\u00e9difice ne pourrait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 et il a reconnu que son id\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019une [Traduction] proposition.\n[52] La solution de rechange no 3a \u00e9tait l\u2019installation d\u2019un appareil \u00e9l\u00e9vateur vertical. M. Rapson croyait que c\u2019\u00e9tait la seule solution possible mais il a reconnu que l\u2019appareil devrait \u00eatre install\u00e9 sur le terrain de la CCN, probablement \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re du site, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des marches. Cela signifiait que le mur de sout\u00e8nement actuel devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9, une proposition co\u00fbteuse, voir m\u00eame inopportune. M. Brown s\u2019est inform\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de construire un ascenseur \u00e0 un autre endroit sur le site, mais M. Rapson a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que cela poserait des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019ing\u00e9nierie\n[53] M. Rapson approuvait, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019id\u00e9e de construire un ascenseur. Il \u00e9tait n\u00e9anmoins pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par l\u2019effet canyon qui serait produit si on installait l\u2019ascenseur \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re du site, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019un mur de sout\u00e8nement de cinq ou six m\u00e8tres de haut. Le passage menant \u00e0 l\u2019ascenseur serait sombre et peu esth\u00e9tique. Il \u00e9tait de plus pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la dimension et la conception de tout ascenseur. Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le vandalisme et les questions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[54] La solution de rechange no 4 consistait \u00e0 utiliser l\u2019ascenseur que l\u2019on proposait d\u2019installer sur le site Daly. M. Rapson estimait que cet ascenseur serait situ\u00e9 trop loin. Cette solution contrevenait \u00e0 au moins deux des principes de la conception universelle, lesquels exigent une solution \u00e9quitable qui demande un faible effort physique. Il croyait \u00e9galement que cette solution aurait pour effet de d\u00e9pr\u00e9cier les personnes qui devaient emprunter le parcours de rechange.\n[55] M. Rapson croyait qu\u2019on devait construire un ascenseur sur le site Daly. Cela ne r\u00e9glait cependant pas le probl\u00e8me des marches de la rue York, o\u00f9 on avait besoin d\u2019un acc\u00e8s sur place. L\u2019utilisation du site Daly aurait \u00e9galement pour effet de d\u00e9pr\u00e9cier les personnes qui devraient utiliser l\u2019ascenseur. M. Rapson estimait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un probl\u00e8me courant en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. Les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience sont involontairement s\u00e9par\u00e9es des autres personnes.\n[56] Il y a un v\u00e9ritable symbolisme ici. Ce genre de question touche l\u2019essence des lois et du concept d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui sont incorpor\u00e9s dans le droit de la personne. Il faut faire des compromis. Dans toute situation, les aspects pratiques doivent \u00eatre pris en compte et il en va de m\u00eame de la dignit\u00e9 des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Les personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches devraient b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de mesures d\u2019accommodement, autant que faire se peut, sur le site m\u00eame.\n[57] M. Rapson a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne lui appartenait pas de substituer son point de vue \u00e0 celui des personnes qui avaient int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que les marches fassent l\u2019objet de mesures d\u2019accommodement. La solution la plus opportune ne pouvait \u00eatre trouv\u00e9e que par un processus de consultation. Il \u00e9tait n\u00e9anmoins convaincu que le site Daly constituait un acc\u00e8s trop \u00e9loign\u00e9 des marches. Il ne restait donc plus que la solution de construire un ascenseur sur le site m\u00eame ou d\u2019utiliser l\u2019ascenseur de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Il estimait \u00e9galement qu\u2019il pouvait y avoir des fa\u00e7ons, jamais envisag\u00e9es, qui permettraient de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught.\n(iii) Barry McMahon [58] Barry McMahon a v\u00e9cu \u00e0 Ottawa pendant 30 ans. \u00c0 une certaine \u00e9poque, il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 audiovisuelle dont le si\u00e8ge social \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 au 61A, rue York, dans le march\u00e9 By. Il conna\u00eet donc tr\u00e8s bien les marches de la rue York et le secteur avoisinant.\n[59] M. McMahon souffre du syndrome de post\u2011poliomy\u00e9lite. Cette maladie a une incidence sur les neurones des muscles, ce qui a pour effet de limiter ses activit\u00e9s. Il se d\u00e9place en fauteuil roulant et en scooter afin de retarder la progression de sa maladie.\n[60] M. McMahon conna\u00eet le plaignant depuis 14 ans. En 1996, il a nomm\u00e9 M. Brown au Comit\u00e9 consultatif municipal sur la d\u00e9ficience alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9. Le Comit\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait vu confier un vaste mandat et s\u2019occupait des affaires municipales dans lesquelles il \u00e9tait question de d\u00e9ficience. Il est maintenant obligatoire, en vertu des lois provinciales de l\u2019Ontario, que les villes ontariennes soient dot\u00e9es d\u2019un tel comit\u00e9.\n[61] Le processus de s\u00e9lection du Comit\u00e9 consultatif municipal est un processus transparent. On recherche les membres par le biais des m\u00e9dias, du conseil municipal, des membres du Comit\u00e9, et par le biais du greffier municipal. Il existe un autre comit\u00e9 qui recommande des candidats comme membres. Ceux-ci sont nomm\u00e9s par le maire, sur d\u00e9cret du conseil.\n[62] Le processus suivi par le Comit\u00e9 \u00e9tait relativement simple. Le comit\u00e9 de planification soumettait des plans d\u2019am\u00e9nagement individuels au Comit\u00e9 consultatif afin que celui\u2011ci fasse des recommandations. Il y avait une feuille de distribution officielle au service de la planification. On ne s\u2019occupait pas de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019\u00e9difice, sauf s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un site municipal.\n[63] M. McMahon a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste de pr\u00e9sident au milieu de 1998. M. Brown a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu nouveau pr\u00e9sident et il a occup\u00e9 ce poste jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la ville d\u2019Ottawa soit fusionn\u00e9e. M. McMahon a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 du Comit\u00e9 consultatif en 2003. Il occupait le poste de pr\u00e9sident int\u00e9rimaire du Comit\u00e9 consulatif sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019Ontario \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9.\n[64] L\u2019historique de l\u2019affaire commence v\u00e9ritablement en 1998 lorsqu\u2019on a inform\u00e9 le Comit\u00e9 consultatif municipal que les marches de la rue York faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019une nouvelle conception. En janvier 1999, le Comit\u00e9 a form\u00e9 un sous\u2011comit\u00e9 pour s\u2019occuper du projet. Le Comit\u00e9 a estim\u00e9 que les marches existantes constituaient un obstacle et il ne voulait pas que cet obstacle soit reproduit. Il y a eu beaucoup de col\u00e8re et de frustration. Le Comit\u00e9 a estim\u00e9 que la conception initiale des marches comportait des lacunes.\n[65] Le Comit\u00e9 a apparemment \u00e9tait avis\u00e9 que, selon les estimations, le co\u00fbt de construction de l\u2019escalier s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8verait \u00e0 38 000 $ par marche. Il a estim\u00e9 que cette somme devrait \u00eatre suffisante pour s\u2019occuper de la question de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. On a re\u00e7u un certain nombre de lettres. M. McMahon croyait que Jim Watson, le maire, avait \u00e9crit au pr\u00e9sident de la CCN.\n[66] Le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal du Comit\u00e9 consultatif sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 de ao\u00fbt 2002 fait mention de la r\u00e9union. Giles Warren et Danielle Vincent ont fait rapport ensemble au Comit\u00e9. M. Warren a inform\u00e9 le Comit\u00e9 que la seule solution qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte par la CCN \u00e9tait l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur sur le site Daly. Selon le Comit\u00e9, la CCN avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019acc\u00e8s serait situ\u00e9 au site Daly. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un fait accompli qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9gociable.\n[67] M. McMahon estimait que le site Daly ne constituait pas une solution viable. Il \u00e9tait tout simplement situ\u00e9 trop loin. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le site Daly ne [Traduction] r\u00e9gl[ait] pas du tout le probl\u00e8me et qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de faire le tour du p\u00e2t\u00e9 de maisons L\u2019acc\u00e8s devrait \u00eatre install\u00e9 directement au bas des marches. Le Comit\u00e9 a estim\u00e9 que le site Daly \u00e9tait une solution symbolique. On a eu l\u2019impression qu\u2019il ne servait \u00e0 rien de participer plus longtemps au processus. M. McMahon r\u00e9alise maintenant que ce fut peut\u2011\u00eatre une erreur.\n[68] M. McMahon a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le 19 mars 1999, il a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 des architectes am\u00e9ricains ainsi qu\u2019au Transportation Barriers Compliance Board \u00e0 Washington D.C. Il les a mis au courant de la situation parce que ceux\u2011ci avaient fourni une partie de l\u2019infrastructure de l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine. Il a re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse de la Compliance Board en avril avec une copie d\u2019une lettre provenant d\u2019une personne travaillant au D\u00e9partement d\u2019\u00c9tat dans laquelle il \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 que l\u2019affaire ne relevait pas de la comp\u00e9tence du Board.\n[69] Selon M. McMahon, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que le probl\u00e8me r\u00e9sidait dans la conception des marches. L\u2019ascenseur du site Daly ne r\u00e8gle pas du tout le probl\u00e8me. Il ne fait tout simplement que d\u00e9tourner le probl\u00e8me. Il n\u2019y a rien de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du site Daly. Il y a beaucoup de congestion dans ce secteur. Il y a des enfants de la rue, des personnes sans abri, des mendiants et des vagabonds. Le coin de la promenade Sussex et de la rue Rideau est particuli\u00e8rement malfam\u00e9.\n[70] M. McMahon estime que la situation actuelle est intol\u00e9rable. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il est \u00e9tonnant de voir jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point la CCN cause des d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ments aux personnes qui se rendent sur le site. Pas seulement aux personnes en fauteuil roulant, mais \u00e9galement aux femmes accompagn\u00e9es de jeunes enfants dans des poussettes, aux personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es, aux personnes qui souffrent d\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9, aux personnes atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience visuelle. S\u2019il existait une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente de franchir les marches, il croit qu\u2019elle servirait beaucoup.\n[71] Selon M. McMahon, la principale solution de rechange serait l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur. La voie r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux autobus est dot\u00e9e d\u2019ascenseurs depuis 10 ans. On pourrait installer un funiculaire. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019on pourrait offrir aux gens une solution de rechange \u00e0 la fois au sommet et \u00e0 la fois au bas des marches. L\u2019endroit le plus pratique pour l\u2019installation du funiculaire serait \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught, au\u2011dessous du palier situ\u00e9 du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rue MacKenzie. Il a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que les personnes qui se d\u00e9placent ensemble doivent pouvoir garder un contact visuel et, selon lui, l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur sur le site constituerait la meilleure solution.\n[72] Il est question d\u2019inclusion en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. M. McMahon a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fait de se s\u00e9parer de la personne qui l\u2019accompagne dans le but d\u2019aller la rejoindre au sommet des marches faisait ressortir sa d\u00e9ficience. Les marches constituent un obstacle. La d\u00e9ficience d\u2019une personne est mise en \u00e9vidence et devient pr\u00e9dominante lorsque la personne est confront\u00e9e \u00e0 un obstacle. L\u2019objet vis\u00e9 par l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 est de faire dispara\u00eetre les obstacles. L\u2019objet vis\u00e9 par la conception universelle est d\u2019incorporer en douceur dans le public et dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\n(iv) Giles Warren [73] Giles Warren a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 depuis Hamilton. Il souffre de poliomy\u00e9lite depuis qu\u2019il est enfant et il se sert d\u2019un fauteuil roulant. Il a v\u00e9cu \u00e0 Ottawa pendant quarante ans et il a si\u00e9g\u00e9 sur le Comit\u00e9 consultatif sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 entre 2000 et 2003. Il occupait le poste de vice\u2011pr\u00e9sident lorsqu\u2019il a quitt\u00e9. M. Warren n\u2019a pas v\u00e9cu longtemps dans le secteur des marches de la rue York. Mais, comme il avait si\u00e9g\u00e9 sur le Comit\u00e9, il \u00e9tait au courant des questions entourant les marches.\n[74] M. Warren \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident du sous\u2011comit\u00e9 sur l\u2019approbation des am\u00e9nagements. En juillet 2002, on lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019assister \u00e0 une r\u00e9union. La r\u00e9union a eu lieu le 23 juillet au si\u00e8ge de la CCN. Parmi les personnes qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 la r\u00e9union, M. Warren ne connaissait que Danielle Vincent. M. Warren affirme qu\u2019il s\u2019est rendu \u00e0 la r\u00e9union dans un esprit d\u2019ouverture. L\u2019\u00e9tude sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 command\u00e9e par la CCN, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire le rapport Robertson, \u00e9tait neutre.\n[75] Toutefois, lorsque M. Warren est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union, il a d\u00e9couvert que M. Martin, l\u2019architecte\u2011conseil, \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 favorable \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019utiliser un ascenseur qui serait situ\u00e9 sur le site Daly. La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9tait devenue une pr\u00e9occupation importante. Dans l\u2019ensemble, le message \u00e9tait simple : la solution de rechange pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e9tait l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9difice Daly. M. Warren affirme qu\u2019on ne s\u2019est jamais s\u00e9rieusement pench\u00e9 sur les autres solutions de rechange. [Traduction] Il s\u2019agissait que d\u2019une mise en sc\u00e8ne.\n[76] Le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de la r\u00e9union r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par M. Martin d\u00e9montre que M. Warren avait souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019opinion que le site Daly constituait la meilleure solution. M. Warren a ni\u00e9 ceci. Il affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019avait souscrit \u00e0 cette opinion que parce que le nombre de solutions de rechange possibles \u00e9tait limit\u00e9. Aucune des solutions de rechange ne r\u00e9glait v\u00e9ritablement le probl\u00e8me, lequel \u00e9tait la conception initiale des marches.\n[77] Le rapport soumis par M. Warren au Comit\u00e9 consultatif municipal emploie les m\u00eames mots. Le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal du Comit\u00e9 qualifie la r\u00e9union de mise en sc\u00e8ne visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations de la CCDP. Une discussion informelle de la situation a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue au Comit\u00e9, puis l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e en suspens. Le Comit\u00e9 a essentiellement laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la CCDP le soin de s\u2019occuper de l\u2019affaire.\n[78] Danielle Vincent de Ressources communautaires pour personnes ayant un handicap assistait \u00e9galement \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. M. Warren a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que celle\u2011ci partageait son opinion que la r\u00e9union n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019une mise en sc\u00e8ne. Comme Mme Vincent n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9, cette d\u00e9claration constitue donc du ou\u00ef-dire. Je crois donc qu\u2019il serait erron\u00e9 de lui accorder de l\u2019importance.\n[79] M. Warren a fait preuve de bienveillance en contre\u2011interrogatoire. Il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que la CCN avait parfaitement le droit de pr\u00e9sumer que le Comit\u00e9 consultatif municipal appuyait la solution du site Daly. Il reconna\u00eet que la CCN n\u2019a peut\u2011\u00eatre pas compris ses objections. Il r\u00e9alise, en r\u00e9trospective, qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb parler de nouveau aux planificateurs et aux architectes et leur faire part de ses opinions.\n[80] Cela ne change pas l\u2019opinion de M. Warren sur la situation. Celui\u2011ci n\u2019aimait aucune des solutions de rechange propos\u00e9es dans le rapport Robertson. Selon lui, l\u2019emplacement projet\u00e9 pour l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur pr\u00e8s des marches n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pratique. Le passage situ\u00e9 entre l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught et les marches \u00e9tait dangereux. Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le vandalisme et par la menace que repr\u00e9sentaient les vagabonds errant dans le secteur. Il entretenait les m\u00eames inqui\u00e9tudes quant au site Daly.\n[81] M. Warren a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur sur le site Daly fournirait un acc\u00e8s \u00e9gal. Selon lui, cela \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 demander \u00e0 des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience d\u2019emprunter la porte arri\u00e8re. Il a affirm\u00e9 que le raisonnement justifiant l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un parcours de rechange ne valait pas plus que le motif s\u00e9par\u00e9 mais \u00e9gal qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pour justifier la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation raciale. Il s\u2019est souvenu de signes qui indiquaient aux Noirs la direction vers les toilettes ou vers la porte arri\u00e8re.\n[82] M. Warren croyait \u00e9galement que la distance additionnelle qu\u2019il faut parcourir pour se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9difice Daly constituait un obstacle important. Il \u00e9tait tout aussi facile de faire le tour du p\u00e2t\u00e9 de maisons.\nB. La preuve de la CCN (i) G\u00e9rald Lajeunesse [83] G\u00e9rald Lajeunesse est l\u2019architecte paysagiste en chef de la CCN. Il travaille pour la CCN depuis 1977. En 1988, il est devenu directeur du projet du boulevard de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\n[84] M. Lajeunesse a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la CCN favorise l\u2019acc\u00e8s universel et qu\u2019elle a publi\u00e9 Accessibilit\u00e9 des parcs et espaces ouverts: guide d'am\u00e9nagement en 1995. Ce manuel constitue un outil pour les personnes qui pr\u00e9parent des projets qui rel\u00e8vent de la CCN. Toutefois, la plus grande partie du processus consiste en de la consultation. En 1996, la CCN a introduit une politique d\u2019acc\u00e8s universel qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 [Traduction] ses sites, ses \u00e9difices, ses services ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 ceux qu\u2019elle loue. Il existe un comit\u00e9 interne qui effectue des \u00e9valuations pour les minist\u00e8res gouvernementaux et qui surveille l\u2019am\u00e9nagement dans la r\u00e9gion.\n[85] Le boulevard de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration est l\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants des plans de la CCN se rapportant \u00e0 la capitale nationale. Le boulevard est long de sept kilom\u00e8tres et demi et comprend le Parcours d\u2019honneur qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence du gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Le terrain en bordure de la promenade Sussex, de l\u2019avenue MacKenzie et des marches de la rue York fait partie du boulevard.\n[86] Le boulevard de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour accueillir de grands rassemblements de personnes et pour permettre aux gens de fl\u00e2ner. Les trottoirs sont larges. Le principe est de donner la priorit\u00e9 aux pi\u00e9tons. M. Lajeunesse a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le parc Major pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant une exception au plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La CCN tente de limiter l\u2019activit\u00e9 dans le secteur, afin de prot\u00e9ger la v\u00e9g\u00e9tation, laquelle reposerait sur un sol mince. La principale voie pi\u00e9tonni\u00e8re va des \u00e9difices du Parlement, sur la rue Wellington, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la rue Rideau, puis elle longe la promenade Sussex jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la rue York et p\u00e9n\u00e8tre dans le secteur du march\u00e9 By.\n[87] M. Lajeunesse est devenu responsable du site des marches de la rue York en 1989. Alex Kilgour, le gestionnaire du projet des marches de la rue York, lui rendait compte. Le site \u00e9tait dot\u00e9 d\u2019un escalier sans importance. Le secteur \u00e9tait abandonn\u00e9. On avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de construire un grand escalier qui cr\u00e9erait un lien visuel tr\u00e8s important entre la basse-ville et la haute\u2011ville.\n[88] C\u2019est ici que l\u2019histoire et l\u2019esth\u00e9tique entrent en ligne de compte. Les marches de la rue York font partie d\u2019un corridor visuel, d\u2019un bassin visuel continu situ\u00e9 entre la basse-ville et la haute\u2011ville. Elles constituent un lien visuel entre la ville-le march\u00e9 By-et l\u2019\u00c9tat, lequel comprend le Ch\u00e2teau Laurier et l\u2019arri\u00e8re des \u00e9difices du Parlement. J\u2019accepte le point de vue de la CCN qu\u2019il est important de prot\u00e9ger le bassin visuel.\n[89] La CCN savait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait tenue de rendre accessibles les marches que l\u2019on envisageait de construire. Les architectes ont \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que l\u2019on installe des rampes. Toutefois, la pente \u00e9tait trop abrupte et il y aurait eu des probl\u00e8mes avec les redresseurs. La CCN a \u00e9galement \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que l\u2019on installe un appareil \u00e9l\u00e9vateur. Le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait que l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des marches aurait eu pour effet de cr\u00e9er un tunnel. C\u2019\u00e9tait ce que l\u2019on craignait. Le site physique \u00e9tait trop limit\u00e9 pour que l\u2019on examine d\u2019autres solutions de rechange.\n[90] Il y avait d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes. Il n\u2019y avait pratiquement aucun magasin le long de la promenade Sussex, donc il y avait peu d\u2019activit\u00e9 le soir. Cela posait un probl\u00e8me sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Des activit\u00e9s inopportunes se d\u00e9roulaient aux marches de la rue York. Il y avait \u00e9galement de nouveaux travaux d\u2019am\u00e9nagement au site Daly. La CCN d\u00e9sirait en profiter et elle avait finalement conclu que c\u2019\u00e9tait le seul site r\u00e9aliste pour la construction d\u2019un ascenseur.\n[91] M. Lajeunesse a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait eu aucune discussion s\u00e9rieuse quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. On a reconnu que les choses pouvaient changer. Jean Piggott, l\u2019ancien pr\u00e9sident de la CCN, avait recommand\u00e9 que les \u00e9difices publics situ\u00e9s sur le boulevard de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration aient une fa\u00e7ade publique Il devrait y avoir une certaine forme d\u2019acc\u00e8s public. Donc, id\u00e9alement, l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught serait ouvert au public d\u2019une quelconque fa\u00e7on.\n[92] Le site Daly \u00e9tait plus pratique et plus accueillant dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il faudrait construire un passage. Il n\u2019y avait pas de coins noirs \u00e0 cet endroit. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un environnement contr\u00f4l\u00e9 qui offrait une plus grande s\u00e9curit\u00e9. M. Lajeunesse a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019on doit profiter des occasions lorsqu\u2019elles se pr\u00e9sentent. La CCN \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire du terrain du site Daly et elle \u00e9tait donc bien plac\u00e9e pour demander des concessions de la part du promoteur. On a tenu des n\u00e9gociations concernant la construction d\u2019un ascenseur sur le site. La CCN a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que l\u2019ascenseur devait satisfaire aux normes universelles.\n[93] On ne s\u2019est pas entendu quant aux motifs sous\u2011jacents \u00e0 la position prise par la CCN lorsque les marches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 initialement con\u00e7ues. La CCDP a affirm\u00e9 que la CCN pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait le site Daly parce que le promoteur assumerait les co\u00fbts. Elle a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019esth\u00e9tique \u00e9tait entr\u00e9e en ligne de compte dans la d\u00e9cision. M. Lajeunesse a tergivers\u00e9, puis il a rejet\u00e9 la proposition selon laquelle les solutions de rechange avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es en raison des co\u00fbts ou de l\u2019esth\u00e9tique. L\u2019examen de l\u2019affaire apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 centr\u00e9 sur d\u2019autres pr\u00e9occupations.\n[94] On a tenu deux s\u00e9ries de consultations avant que les marches ne soient construites. Dans le cadre de l\u2019une de ces s\u00e9ries de consultation une r\u00e9union avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue avec le Comit\u00e9 technique interminist\u00e9riel sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9, et dans le cadre de l\u2019autre s\u00e9rie de consultation une r\u00e9union avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue avec des repr\u00e9sentants de Ressources communautaires pour personnes ayant un handicap. Il y a eu des discussions avec la CCDP et il y a eu une autre s\u00e9rie de consultations apr\u00e8s que M. Brown eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte. Cela a abouti \u00e0 une r\u00e9union qui a eu lieu en 2002.\n[95] Lors de ces consultations, la CCDP a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir des renseignements sur l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Dans une lettre, dat\u00e9e du 24 octobre 2000, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Lajeunesse, la CCDP a demand\u00e9 des d\u00e9tails sur l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught, notamment sur le secteur de l\u2019entr\u00e9e de service, le secteur de l\u2019entr\u00e9e principale et sur les plans des \u00e9tages.\n[96] M. Lajeunesse a demand\u00e9 des renseignements et il a \u00e9ventuellement re\u00e7u une br\u00e8ve lettre, dat\u00e9e du 13 septembre 2001, de la part de Raymond Charette, un gestionnaire des immeubles et des installations pour Travaux publics. Cette lettre \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9e :\n[Traduction]\nLes exigences \u00e9lev\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du bureau principal de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught et les co\u00fbts exorbitants qu\u2019entra\u00eenerait la modification de cet \u00e9difice du patrimoine en vue d\u2019installer un ascenseur public nous emp\u00eache d\u2019ouvrir cet \u00e9difice au public entre l\u2019avenue Mackenzie et la promenade Sussex.\nIl s\u2019agissait essentiellement du dernier mot sur le sujet et il mettait un terme \u00e0 toute discussion.\n[97] La CCN a expliqu\u00e9 sa position dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la CCDP le 3 octobre 2001. Cette lettre \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9e :\n[Traduction]\nLors du stade de la conception initiale des marches de la rue York, la CCN n\u2019a pas \u00e9tudi\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e de fournir l\u2019acc\u00e8s universel par le biais de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught parce qu\u2019[il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9] \u00e9difice f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 haute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et que, ainsi, il ne pouvait pas, \u00e0 ce titre, \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un \u00e9difice public. Les heures d\u2019ouverture de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught sont tr\u00e8s contraignantes alors que les heures d\u2019activit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9difice du site Daly seraient assez flexibles pour que l\u2019on puisse y installer un acc\u00e8s universel entre la rue MacKenzie et la promenade Sussex.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu du fait que l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught et l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine sont des \u00e9difices \u00e0 haute s\u00e9curit\u00e9, la Commission de la [capitale nationale] a trouv\u00e9 un parcours de rechange \u00e9quitable contigu qui passe par le site Daly.\nLa Commission s\u2019oppose cat\u00e9goriquement \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration voulant qu\u2019elle ne comprend pas clairement ce qu\u2019est la conception et l\u2019acc\u00e8s universel et que l\u2019on devrait donner une ou des s\u00e9ances de formation ad\u00e9quate aux membres de son personnel.\nLa CCN s\u2019en tient \u00e0 cette position.\n[98] La CCN a n\u00e9anmoins examin\u00e9 la situation une deuxi\u00e8me fois apr\u00e8s que M. Brown eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte. Il y aurait eu m\u00e9diation. La CCN a command\u00e9 une \u00e9tude d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 Robertson Martin et cette \u00e9tude a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience sous le nom de rapport Robertson. Ce rapport statue rapidement sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que les \u00e9difices situ\u00e9s \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du site pourraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 titre d\u2019acc\u00e8s.\n[Traduction]\nLes \u00e9difices situ\u00e9s \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019escalier York sont des \u00e9difices \u00e0 haute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, il est impossible de les utiliser pour des ascenseurs, etc. De plus, les heures d\u2019acc\u00e8s seraient limit\u00e9es.\nLe rapport souligne \u00e9galement que la GRC a pris des mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans le secteur.\n[99] Il semble que c\u2019est M. Martin, l\u2019architecte conseil, qui a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 la r\u00e9union du 23 juillet 2002 \u00e0 laquelle M. Warren a assist\u00e9 au nom du Comit\u00e9 consultatif municipal. M. Lajeunesse a \u00e9galement jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le de premier plan. M. Lajeunesse a affirm\u00e9 que, de l\u2019avis de tous, le site Daly \u00e9tait le meilleur endroit. J\u2019accepte qu\u2019il \u00e9tait sinc\u00e8re lorsqu\u2019il a fait cette affirmation.\n(ii) Jerrold Corush [100] Jerrold Corush est un architecte\u2011paysagiste. En 1994, la CCN a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 sa firme de participer \u00e0 la conception de l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 celles des marches de la rue York. L\u2019ambassade a fait l\u2019objet de deux conceptions en raison des questions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019attentat \u00e0 la bombe d\u2019Oklahoma City.\n[101] M. Corush a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que sa firme avait examin\u00e9 la question de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. Toutes les solutions de rechange avaient sembl\u00e9 probl\u00e9matiques. On avait rejet\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019installer une rampe. Il y aurait trop de virages et le nombre de zigzags semblait plut\u00f4t \u00e9lev\u00e9. Les personnes qui utiliseraient la rampe heurteraient les personnes qui montent et celles qui descendent les marches.\n[102] On avait examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019installer un funiculaire. Un funiculaire est essentiellement une bo\u00eete sur roues. On aurait eu besoin d\u2019un op\u00e9rateur. On \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par des questions d\u2019ordre op\u00e9rationnel et par des questions d\u2019ordre s\u00e9curitaire. On avait examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019installer un escalier roulant, lequel devrait \u00eatre situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019un b\u00e2timent. On devrait construire un b\u00e2timent. Cela poserait des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019entretien.\n[103] On avait discut\u00e9 de l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur. On avait song\u00e9 \u00e0 deux endroits o\u00f9 on pourrait installer l\u2019ascenseur. Le premier endroit \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 au fond de l\u2019all\u00e9e, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des marches, et il \u00e9tait alors utilis\u00e9 par les camions qui allaient et venaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Cela posait probl\u00e8me. Les camions avaient besoin de tout l\u2019espace pour pouvoir tourner. De la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle les choses fonctionnaient, les camions heurtaient les murs. L\u2019espace compris entre les marches et l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught \u00e9tait \u00e9galement un espace cach\u00e9. On ne disposerait pas du personnel suffisant pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du lieu.\n[104] Les architectes avaient \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019installer une tour d\u2019ascenseur sur la promenade Sussex ainsi qu\u2019une passerelle qui m\u00e8nerait \u00e0 la rue Mackenzie. Cette id\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en raison de la vue\u2014elle aurait une incidence sur la porosit\u00e9 de la vue\u2014et \u00e9galement parce qu\u2019elle suscitait des inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. La temp\u00e9rature constituait un autre probl\u00e8me. La passerelle serait expos\u00e9e \u00e0 la vue du public mais ce ne serait pas le cas des passants qui l\u2019emprunteraient. Il y avait donc des probl\u00e8mes en mati\u00e8re de conception et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 avec les deux endroits envisag\u00e9s pour l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur.\n[105] On avait examin\u00e9 ces questions en d\u00e9tail. La mani\u00e8re selon laquelle l\u2019ascenseur fonctionnerait avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e. Par exemple, se servirait\u2011on de cartes d\u2019acc\u00e8s? Cela serait peu commode. M. Corush estimait qu\u2019un op\u00e9rateur devrait probablement faire fonctionner l\u2019ascenseur. On avait discut\u00e9 de la question de la surveillance. La CCDP avait affirm\u00e9 que les co\u00fbts avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en compte lorsqu\u2019on avait examin\u00e9 ces questions.\n[106] Je crois que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment minimis\u00e9 l\u2019importance de l\u2019esth\u00e9tique lorsqu\u2019elle avait pris ces d\u00e9cisions. M. Corush a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les architectes voulaient pr\u00e9server la vue qui englobait la rue York, les marches et la biblioth\u00e8que du Parlement. Cette vue cr\u00e9\u00e9e un lien entre le souverain et ses sujets. Ils d\u00e9siraient \u00e9galement construire un escalier qui s\u2019harmoniserait avec l\u2019ambassade.\n[107] En fin de compte, aucune des solutions envisag\u00e9es sur le site m\u00eame ne semblait acceptable. On avait donc examin\u00e9 ce qui pourrait convenir \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du site et on avait conclu que la circulation pi\u00e9tonni\u00e8re qui provenait du march\u00e9 se dirigeait vers deux endroits principaux. Il s\u2019agissait du Ch\u00e2teau Laurier, de la Colline parlementaire, puis du parc Major. Les pi\u00e9tons ont besoin d\u2019un chemin pour se rendre \u00e0 chacun de ces endroits. Le deuxi\u00e8me chemin existait d\u00e9j\u00e0 : si n\u00e9cessaire, les gens pouvaient faire le tour de l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine et ils arrivaient au coin nord\u2011est du parc. Le site Daly pouvait servir de premier chemin.\n[108] C\u2019est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 les choses en sont rest\u00e9es. Il n\u2019y avait pas eu de v\u00e9ritable processus de consultation et les architectes s\u2019\u00e9taient fi\u00e9s \u00e0 leur propre jugement lorsqu\u2019ils avaient recommand\u00e9 la conception finale. Ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tout \u00e0 fait satisfaits de la situation. M. Corush a reconnu que l\u2019utilisation des chemins de rechange prenait beaucoup plus de temps, en raison de la distance, et que cela \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement vrai pour une personne en fauteuil roulant. Il a reconnu que les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience seraient d\u00e9log\u00e9es par les marches de la rue York. Je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une reconnaissance implicite de l\u2019existence d\u2019un traitement distinct.\n(iii) Robert Martin [109] Les services de Robert Martin ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus par la CCN en avril 2002 afin que celui\u2011ci \u00e9tudie la question des marches de la rue York. On a fait cela en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte de M. Brown et en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate faite par la CCDP sur celle\u2011ci. La firme de M. Martin, Robertson Martin Architects, est sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e en accessibilit\u00e9 universelle. Elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait des rapports de recherche et des \u00e9valuations de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 pour le compte de la CCN.\n[110] M. Martin a effectu\u00e9 un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 du site et a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un rapport intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00c9tude d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 universelle : les marches de la rue York. Ce rapport est dat\u00e9 de juillet 2002 et comprend un certain nombre d\u2019annexes. L\u2019annexe B \u00e9num\u00e8re les sept principes de la conception universelle, lesquels sont conformes aux principes \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans le rapport Rapson. M. Martin a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que ces principes constituent la meilleure pratique dans le domaine.\n[111] Le groupe d\u2019experts\u2011conseils qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le rapport disposait d\u2019un grand \u00e9ventail de documents qui avaient trait au site de la rue York. Il disposait notamment des dossiers DAO (dessin assist\u00e9 par ordinateur) qui ont servi \u00e0 la construction des marches. Il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen physique du site. Il a effectu\u00e9 une estimation des co\u00fbts de type D pour un ascenseur et il est arriv\u00e9 au montant de 427 000 $. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une estimation brute, tout au plus, qui comporte une marge d\u2019erreur importante de plus ou moins 20 p. 100.\n[112] M. Martin a d\u00e9crit comme suit l\u2019objet vis\u00e9 par le rapport Robertson :\n[Traduction]\nM. Martin : Je crois qu\u2019on avait vraiment le sentiment que les marches avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 construites et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une deuxi\u00e8me occasion d\u2019examiner l\u2019ensemble des installations existantes et de voir s\u2019il n\u2019existerait pas de nouvelles technologies ou de nouveaux dispositifs qui n\u2019existaient pas lorsque les marches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ues, puis construites, et dont la CCN ne conna\u00eet pas l\u2019existence et dont nous pourrions faire mention dans notre rapport.\nIl ressort de la preuve que la CCN d\u00e9sirait pr\u00e9server la conception initiale des marches. Je crois que c\u2019est probablement l\u2019une des raisons pour laquelle c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des marches que l\u2019on envisageait d\u2019installer un ascenseur. Il s\u2019agissait de trouver une sorte d\u2019ajout qui r\u00e8glerait le probl\u00e8me de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9, et ce, sans perturber la conception initiale.\n[113] La CCN n\u2019a pas simplement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Martin d\u2019examiner les r\u00e9am\u00e9nagements qui pourraient \u00eatre faits. Celui\u2011ci a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019un des principaux objectifs vis\u00e9s par le rapport Robertson \u00e9tait la consultation de la collectivit\u00e9 et des personnes qui avaient besoin d\u2019un acc\u00e8s.\n[Traduction]\nM. Martin : L\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 ne consistait pas uniquement \u00e0 examiner tous les probl\u00e8mes pos\u00e9s par le site actuel, mais \u00e9galement de faire participer la collectivit\u00e9 et les groupes int\u00e9ress\u00e9s au processus de telle sorte que ceux\u2011ci fassent part de leurs r\u00e9actions quant aux solutions de rechange possibles et disent si elles sont sens\u00e9es.\nNous avons communiqu\u00e9 avec un certain nombre de groupes communautaires et nous leur avons demand\u00e9 de fournir des repr\u00e9sentants pour l\u2019\u00e9tude. La s\u00e9ance d\u2019information directe donn\u00e9e par la CCN devait \u00eatre la plus inclusive possible si on voulait obtenir cette orchestration parce que l\u2019\u00e9tude ne serait pas tr\u00e8s utile si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9e avec la pleine participation de ces groupes.\nLa CCN \u00e9tait intransigeante quant \u00e0 cet aspect du processus.\n[114] Le plan vis\u00e9 par M. Martin lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9crit le rapport \u00e9tait de d\u00e9cider quelles solutions de rechange \u00e9taient r\u00e9alistes et de mettre en \u00e9vidence les avantages et les d\u00e9savantages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par chacune d\u2019elles. Ces solutions de rechange comprenaient l\u2019installation de diff\u00e9rentes plate\u2011formes \u00e9l\u00e9vatrices ou l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur, soit sur le site, soit \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du site. M. Martin pr\u00e9senterait ensuite ces solutions de rechange aux groupes int\u00e9ress\u00e9s et obtiendrait leurs points de vue. Le rapport final tiendrait compte de leurs points de vue.\n[115] La CCDP a fait grand cas du fait que le rapport pr\u00e9liminaire recommandait que l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur sur le lieu des marches constituerait la meilleure fa\u00e7on de fournir l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. Une note de service a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par courriel par Danica Robertson \u00e0 Sherry Berg, \u00e0 la CCN, le 17 juin \u00e0 13 h 37. Il y \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 que l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur sur le lieu des marches de la rue York constituerait la meilleure solution. Mme Berg a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 16 h 39, le m\u00eame jour, et a demand\u00e9 que le site Daly soit ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la liste des solutions de rechange figurant dans le rapport.\n[116] M. Martin a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il y avait un probl\u00e8me de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. On a donc examin\u00e9 les solutions possibles le long du p\u00e2t\u00e9 de maisons et on a d\u00e9couvert que le contrat de bail que les promoteurs du site Daly avaient sign\u00e9 pr\u00e9voyait l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur. Le site serait dot\u00e9 d\u2019un dispositif de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 passif. Il y aurait un concierge. Il y aurait \u00e9galement des r\u00e9sidents dans le secteur.\n[117] Le rapport pr\u00e9liminaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 des groupes de contact d\u00e9sign\u00e9s. S\u2019en est suivi la controvers\u00e9e r\u00e9union du 22 juillet 2002. Il me semble que la r\u00e9union s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e tr\u00e8s rapidement. Les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s le 18 juillet. Sherry Berg a apparemment conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Martin de ne pas inviter M. Brown \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait partie \u00e0 l\u2019instance engag\u00e9e devant le Tribunal. Celui\u2011ci n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la tenue de la r\u00e9union.\n[118] Cinq repr\u00e9sentants de la CCN ainsi que deux architectes\u2011conseils \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Un repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent. Je crois que cette pr\u00e9sence officielle a influenc\u00e9 les autres participants. Ceux\u2011ci \u00e9taient inf\u00e9rieurs en nombre (quatre contre sept). La preuve donne n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 penser que deux des participants externes furent satisfaits quant aux solutions envisag\u00e9es.\n[119] Selon M. Martin, les personnes qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 la r\u00e9union ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9es. Chacune des personnes qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 la r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 donner son opinion. Il semble qu\u2019un certain nombre des repr\u00e9sentants de la CCN aient \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9s. Selon M. Martin, il y a eu consensus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Cette appr\u00e9ciation est tr\u00e8s incompl\u00e8te. M. Warren, pour sa part, a d\u00e9crit l\u2019exercice dans son ensemble comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 une mise en sc\u00e8ne. Cette affirmation est peut\u2011\u00eatre trop s\u00e9v\u00e8re, mais il semble \u00e9vident que les r\u00e9sultats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9s d\u2019avance.\n[120] On a fait une analyse g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des solutions de rechange mentionn\u00e9es dans le rapport pr\u00e9liminaire. L\u2019installation envisag\u00e9e d\u2019un ascenseur exigerait qu\u2019il y ait un acc\u00e8s sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 du mur de sout\u00e8nement, \u00e0 une certaine distance de la rue. Les usagers auraient l\u2019impression d\u2019\u00eatre dans une ruelle sinistre. Il y a eu un d\u00e9bat durant l\u2019audience quant \u00e0 savoir quels seraient les endroits o\u00f9 il serait possible d\u2019installer l\u2019ascenseur envisag\u00e9. Il existe apparemment une r\u00e8gle fondamentale selon laquelle l\u2019entr\u00e9e d\u2019un ascenseur doit se trouver au bas des marches auxquelles il est rattach\u00e9. M. Brown fut m\u00e9content du fait que ce principe ne fut pas pris en compte.\n[121] C\u2019\u00e9tait la longueur de la passerelle qui poserait un probl\u00e8me du point de vue de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Elle devrait \u00eatre couverte et chauff\u00e9e afin de prot\u00e9ger les usagers contre les intemp\u00e9ries. Cela aurait pour effet d\u2019attirer les sans-abris, lesquels recherchent naturellement le confort et la protection d\u2019un espace ferm\u00e9. Cela pose toutefois un probl\u00e8me de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 important, notamment dans le cas des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience car celles\u2011ci sont plus vuln\u00e9rables que les autres personnes dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. M. Martin a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 l\u2019attitude qui r\u00e9gnait \u00e0 la r\u00e9union par la phrase suivante : [Traduction] Vous pouvez installer un ascenseur \u00e0 cet endroit, mais je ne l\u2019utiliserais pas.\n[122] En fin de compte, M. Martin a cru que la proposition du site Daly avait re\u00e7u un appui massif. Il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union et l\u2019a distribu\u00e9. Il a demand\u00e9 si on devait apporter des corrections. Aucune demande de corrections n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Il y aurait eu un certain nombre de communications ult\u00e9rieures, mais aucune n\u2019a modifi\u00e9 le consensus auquel on \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 lors de la r\u00e9union. M. Martin a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de faire d\u2019autres commentaires.\n[123] M. Martin a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught poserait de nombreux probl\u00e8mes internes. On devrait emprunter des marches au premier \u00e9tage ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage sup\u00e9rieur afin d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019ascenseur \u00e0 partir de la rue. Il a cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 honn\u00eate sur la question. Ces possibilit\u00e9s n\u2019ont jamais vraiment fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen.\n[124] Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union, M. Martin a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 son rapport. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 examin\u00e9 les solutions qui y \u00e9taient mentionn\u00e9es en examinant le t\u00e9moignage de M. Rapson. Certaines modifications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es. Le site Daly a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 et en bout de ligne il a \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la meilleure solution. On a apport\u00e9 des modifications mineures. La phrase suivante a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e au paragraphe 2.2 : [Traduction] On a exclu les solutions d\u2019ordre m\u00e9canique en raison des co\u00fbts \u00e9lev\u00e9s de construction et d\u2019entretien ainsi qu\u2019en raison des craintes de vandalisme. Cette phrase a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de la conversation qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue \u00e0 la r\u00e9union.\n[125] On a apport\u00e9 une autre modification. Il y a des installations de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine, laquelle est situ\u00e9e dans le secteur. Le rapport pr\u00e9liminaire mentionnait que la pr\u00e9sence de la GRC dans les environs assurerait la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans le secteur des marches. M. Martin a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que la police n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans le secteur des marches. Le rapport a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9.\n[126] Les parties ne se sont pas entendues quant aux co\u00fbts et quant \u00e0 l\u2019esth\u00e9tique. M. Martin a reconnu que des consid\u00e9rations esth\u00e9tiques sont entr\u00e9es en ligne de compte. Aucune des solutions de rechange n\u2019a toutefois \u00e9t\u00e9 discr\u00e9dit\u00e9e pour ce motif. M. Martin a minimis\u00e9 l\u2019importance des co\u00fbts. On a donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cela en faisant remarquer que la CCN avait choisi la solution la moins on\u00e9reuse, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, le status quo. Les marches de la rue York sont demeur\u00e9es exactement comme elles \u00e9taient.\n[127] Je suis convaincu que les co\u00fbts ont constitu\u00e9 un facteur important. Le rapport fait mention de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019assurer l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 universelle sans imposer un fardeau financier excessif \u00e0 la CCN.\nLa moins imparfaite, quoique tr\u00e8s probl\u00e9matique, fa\u00e7on d\u2019assurer l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 universelle sur le site serait de reconstruire le mur sud de l\u2019escalier dans un nouvel endroit afin de pouvoir installer une rampe d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un appareil \u00e9l\u00e9vateur. Il faudrait faire une toute nouvelle conception de l\u2019escalier et de la structure, \u00e0 grands frais pour la CCN, et cela aurait pour cons\u00e9quence d\u2019introduire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui pourraient g\u00e2cher la vue que l\u2019on a sur la Colline parlementaire \u00e0 partir du march\u00e9 By. Compte tenu qu\u2019il y aura un ascenseur accessible 24 heures par jour au site Daly voisin, les co\u00fbts globaux de construction li\u00e9s au d\u00e9placement du mur et \u00e0 l\u2019installation d\u2019un appareil \u00e9l\u00e9vateur, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la destruction de la sym\u00e9trie de l\u2019escalier et de la vue sur la Colline parlementaire, pourraient \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s d\u2019exorbitants \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019utilisation finale envisag\u00e9e. Le r\u00e9sultat obtenu pourrait rebuter les utilisateurs.\nJe crois qu\u2019il est clair que les co\u00fbts et l\u2019esth\u00e9tique constituent des facteurs importants.\n[128] M. Martin a affirm\u00e9 que la seule solution qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9alisable du point de vue des co\u00fbts \u00e9tait de reconstruire l\u2019escalier au complet. Les incidences sont inqui\u00e9tantes. S\u2019il s\u2019agit tout simplement d\u2019une autre fa\u00e7on de dire que l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre fournie, alors il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante. La CCN ne peut toutefois pas construire les marches sans fournir un acc\u00e8s, puis tout simplement pr\u00e9tendre que, en raison de la conception des marches, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 trop on\u00e9reux de fournir un acc\u00e8s.\n[129] M. Martin n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfait de la solution d\u00e9finitive mais il affirme que c\u2019\u00e9tait ce que l\u2019on pouvait faire de mieux dans les circonstances. M. Brown a soulign\u00e9 que M. Martin ne savait pas qu\u2019il y avait une pente entre les marches de la rue York et le site Daly. Cette diff\u00e9rence n\u2019aurait de l\u2019importance que pour une personne ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Il \u00e9tait manifestement d\u2019avis que M. Martin n\u2019avait pas tenu compte de l\u2019importance de la distance entre les marches de la rue York et le site Daly.\n(iv) \u00c9ric H\u00e9bert [130] \u00c9ric H\u00e9bert travaille depuis 17 ans \u00e0 la CCN comme technologue en architecture et comme conseiller en accessibilit\u00e9. Il conna\u00eet bien les principes de la conception universelle et il examine les plans d\u2019am\u00e9nagement en ce qui a trait aux questions d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. Son travail consiste \u00e0 voir \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il y ait assez d\u2019espace pour permettre l\u2019acc\u00e8s en fauteuil roulant. Il organise \u00e9galement des ateliers portant sur les mesures d\u2019accommodement destin\u00e9es aux personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\n[131] M. H\u00e9bert est membre du Comit\u00e9 interminist\u00e9riel sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. Il est \u00e9galement membre d\u2019un comit\u00e9 interne de la CCN qui s\u2019occupe des questions de d\u00e9ficiences physiques, auditives et visuelles. Le comit\u00e9 interne s\u2019occupe des questions d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 qui sont soulev\u00e9es lors de la conception et (ou) lors de la r\u00e9novation d\u2019\u00e9difices. En 1993 et 1994, la CCN lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 au site de la rue York, puis de faire rapport quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de construction d\u2019une rampe. M. H\u00e9bert n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la conception initiale des marches.\n[132] La CCN et Travaux publics ont donc tenu une r\u00e9union le 22 novembre 1994 afin de discuter des marches de la rue York. M. H\u00e9bert a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 constituait la principale pr\u00e9occupation. Le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de la r\u00e9union indique toutefois le contraire. Il y est mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\n[\u2026] les solutions \u00e0 caract\u00e8re m\u00e9canique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9es en raison des co\u00fbts de construction initiaux plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s, des frais qu\u2019entra\u00eeneraient l\u2019entretien et l\u2019exploitation ainsi qu\u2019en raison des r\u00e9percussions financi\u00e8res de la r\u00e9novation et de l\u2019entretien \u00e0 long terme.\nCette affirmation donne \u00e0 penser que les d\u00e9penses constituaient la principale pr\u00e9occupation. En 1999, la CCN a \u00e9mis une lettre qui \u00e9taye cette affirmation. Le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal \u00e9tablit \u00e9galement qu\u2019une personne a soulev\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019on pourrait peut\u2011\u00eatre utiliser l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Cette id\u00e9e est rest\u00e9e sans suite.\n[133] M. H\u00e9bert a alors inspect\u00e9 le site. Il a eu une autre rencontre le 13 d\u00e9cembre 1994, avec deux personnes travaillant \u00e0 Ressources communautaires pour personnes ayant un handicap et quatre personnes travaillant \u00e0 la CCN. M. H\u00e9bert a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union que la pente de la colline faisait en sorte qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s difficile d\u2019installer une rampe. La rampe devrait avoir une pente de 8\u00ba et \u00eatre longue de 150 m\u00e8tres environ. Ces deux facteurs poseraient un probl\u00e8me aux personnes en fauteuil roulant.\n[134] M. H\u00e9bert a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il existait d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes. La rampe devrait \u00eatre orient\u00e9e dans le sens contraire de la circulation des pi\u00e9tons. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une solution viable. Le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait que cela signifiait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun acc\u00e8s. M. H\u00e9bert a \u00e9crit une note de service \u00e0 M. Kilgour dans laquelle il mentionnait qu\u2019un acc\u00e8s de rechange devrait \u00eatre install\u00e9 sur le site m\u00eame des marches. La note de service mentionnait que le site devrait \u00eatre totalement accessible. Les parcours alternatifs aux escaliers de la rue York permettront donc \u00e0 toute la population de jouir de ce site.\n[135] La s\u00e9curit\u00e9, toutefois, constituait une source de pr\u00e9occupation, notamment \u00e0 ce qui avait trait au passage entre les marches et l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Une partie du probl\u00e8me provenait du fait que l\u2019ascenseur serait situ\u00e9 dans un espace clos. Il est facile de cacher des choses dans un tel espace. On a discut\u00e9 de la question de savoir si l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur transparent poserait \u00e9galement des probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. M. H\u00e9bert a affirm\u00e9 que ce type de pr\u00e9occupation avait pris naissance apr\u00e8s l\u2019attentat \u00e0 la bombe d\u2019Oklahoma City. On l\u2019a plus tard corrig\u00e9 et il a cru que c\u2019\u00e9tait un autre attentat \u00e0 la bombe qui avait suscit\u00e9 ces pr\u00e9occupations. Cela n\u2019a aucune importance. On ne pensait plus de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. La pr\u00e9occupation \u00e9tait n\u00e9e.\n[136] On se pr\u00e9occupait \u00e9galement du vandalisme et de la congestion dans le passage \u00e9troit situ\u00e9 entre l\u2019\u00e9difice et les marches. Il y avait des camions qui tournaient dans le secteur. On aurait \u00e9galement un probl\u00e8me au sommet de l\u2019ascenseur car les personnes en fauteuil roulant devraient traverser la circulation pi\u00e9tonni\u00e8re. L\u2019espace pour l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9. La CCDP a \u00e9videmment affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019espace \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 en raison de la conception des marches.\n[137] M. H\u00e9bert a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, en bout de ligne, c\u2019est pour des raisons de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qu\u2019on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas installer d\u2019ascenseur. Il \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du site 24 heures par jour. Selon M. H\u00e9bert, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une consid\u00e9ration importante car les personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches sont plus vuln\u00e9rables que les autres personnes. En contre\u2011interrogatoire, M. Brown s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette affirmation. Il croit fermement en l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019autonomie, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire au droit qu\u2019ont les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience de prendre leurs propres d\u00e9cisions sur ces questions. M. H\u00e9bert a r\u00e9pondu que l\u2019obligation de la CCN de prot\u00e9ger le public l\u2019emporte sur le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie.\n[138] M. H\u00e9bert a affirm\u00e9 que le promoteur qui a pris le site Daly \u00e0 sa charge avait affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur sur le site pourrait servir de moyen d\u2019acc\u00e8s de rechange. On a discut\u00e9 des parcours et de la circulation pi\u00e9tonni\u00e8re dans le secteur. M. H\u00e9bert a pr\u00e9tendu que l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur sur le site des marches de la rue York servirait surtout pour l\u2019acc\u00e8s au parc Major. La circulation vers le Ch\u00e2teau Laurier ou le Parlement serait contr\u00f4l\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on plus efficace au site Daly.\n[139] M. H\u00e9bert \u00e9tait visiblement inconfortable \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Bien que sa loyaut\u00e9 aille \u00e0 la CCN, il a reconnu que les marches de la rue York ne sont dot\u00e9es d\u2019aucune mesure d\u2019accommodement destin\u00e9e aux personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches. Il a reconnu en contre\u2011interrogatoire que les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience devraient \u00eatre int\u00e9gr\u00e9es dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Elles ne devraient pas faire l\u2019objet de s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation. Il a reconnu que les marches divisent les gens entre eux.\n(v) Katie Paialunga [140] Katie Paialunga travaille comme directrice administrative au Centre de vie autonome. Ce centre vient en aide aux personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience qui vivent seules. Sa client\u00e8le est compos\u00e9e de personnes ayant diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9ficiences plut\u00f4t que de personnes n\u2019ayant que des probl\u00e8mes pr\u00e9cis de mobilit\u00e9. Le centre est souvent consult\u00e9 par le gouvernement et les organismes sociaux en rapport avec des questions concernant les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\n[141] Mme Paialunga est parapl\u00e9gique et se d\u00e9place en fauteuil roulant. Elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait des contr\u00f4les d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 et elle conna\u00eet bien les principes utilis\u00e9s dans ce processus. La CCN lui a demand\u00e9 des conseils quant aux marches de la rue York apr\u00e8s que M. Brown eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP. Elle a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 23 juillet 2002 \u00e0 titre de directrice administrative du centre.\n[142] On ne s\u2019est pas entendu quant \u00e0 l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de consulter le Centre de vie autonome et Mme Paialunga en particulier. M. Brown a fait remarquer que le Centre de vie autonome n\u2019est pas un groupe de revendication. Il ne poss\u00e8de aucune comp\u00e9tence particuli\u00e8re en mati\u00e8re de mobilit\u00e9 restreinte. Mme Paialunga a convenu qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une porte\u2011parole. Elle a \u00e9galement convenu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union en tant que repr\u00e9sentante de la collectivit\u00e9 des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Elle a tout simplement offert son opinion de personne avertie qui poss\u00e8de une bonne connaissance pratique des besoins des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\n[143] Mme Paialunga estimait que sa participation \u00e0 la r\u00e9union ferait partie du cadre normal de ses t\u00e2ches. M. Brown l\u2019a contre\u2011interrog\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet et a manifestement estim\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union de son propre chef. Elle n\u2019a discut\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire avec le conseil d\u2019administration que lorsque le rapport sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 d\u00e9finitif a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle a su qu\u2019elle t\u00e9moignerait \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[144] Le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de la r\u00e9union du 23 juillet a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve par Mme Paialunga. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019objet de la r\u00e9union \u00e9tait de d\u00e9cider quelles \u00e9taient les meilleures solutions de rechange parmi celles qui figuraient dans le rapport sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9. Les solutions de rechange ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par M. Martin. Toutes les solutions de rechange ont \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9es et on a convenu d\u2019un commun accord, apr\u00e8s la discussion, que la solution du site Daly serait recommand\u00e9e. Mme Paialunga n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019impression que M. Martin ou l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des participants officiels favorisaient une solution en particulier.\n[145] C\u2019est la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui constituait la plus grande pr\u00e9occupation. De l\u2019avis de tout le monde, le site Daly \u00e9tait le meilleur site \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La construction d\u2019un ascenseur sur le site des marches posait des probl\u00e8mes. Il y avait des camions. Il y avait un passage obscur. Mme Paialunga a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle n\u2019aimerait pas emprunter ce passage le soir. Selon elle, une personne pourrait se faire pi\u00e9ger. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par la question du d\u00e9neigement et par l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un ascenseur ext\u00e9rieur par temps froid.\n[146] Un autre probl\u00e8me se posait en rapport avec l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une rampe de service situ\u00e9e \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 on proposait d\u2019installer l\u2019ascenseur. Mme Paialunga estimait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9gradant de pr\u00e9voir, dans une entr\u00e9e de service, un acc\u00e8s pour les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience. M. Brown a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait utiliser la rampe de service pour avoir acc\u00e8s plut\u00f4t que de marcher dans la rue et de faire le tour de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Il a d\u00e9crit cela comme \u00e9tant une question d\u2019autonomie.\n[147] M. Brown a \u00e9galement contre\u2011interrog\u00e9 Mme Paialunga en rapport avec les diff\u00e9rences qui existent entre les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Il a attir\u00e9 son attention sur l\u2019effort suppl\u00e9mentaire que devrait fournir un quadripl\u00e9gique, comme lui, pour franchir le site Daly, puis pour emprunter la rue situ\u00e9e en haut afin de se rendre au sommet des marches Mme Paialunga a convenu que le degr\u00e9 d\u2019effort exig\u00e9 pour utiliser le parcours de rechange \u00e9tait l\u2019un des principaux facteurs qui devraient \u00eatre pris en compte quant \u00e0 la question de l\u2019installation d\u2019un moyen d\u2019acc\u00e8s.\n[148] M. Vigna a contre\u2011interrog\u00e9 Mme Paialunga pour le compte de la CCDP. Il a renvoy\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de la r\u00e9union, lequel donnait \u00e0 penser que M. Martin avait commenc\u00e9 par faire un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des diverses solutions de rechange puis avait inform\u00e9 les participants que, selon lui, le choix du site Daly constituait la meilleure solution. La discussion s\u2019est poursuivie \u00e0 partir de l\u00e0. Selon Mme Paialunga, le proc\u00e8s-verbal \u00e9tait trompeur. Elle s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation de M. Vigna que le choix du site Daly avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme constituant la meilleure solution.\n[149] On a fait un examen quant \u00e0 l\u2019ordre pr\u00e9cis de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union; je ne propose pas d\u2019en discuter. Elizabeth Norris, une repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019Association canadienne des parapl\u00e9giques, aurait affirm\u00e9 que les experts\u2011conseils avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que le choix du site Daly constituait la meilleure solution. Cette affirmation est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par le reste de la preuve. Il ressort clairement des t\u00e9moignages de M. Corush, de M. Lajeunesse et de M. H\u00e9bert que la CCN et les architectes\u2011conseils favorisaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 le choix du site Daly.\n[150] Il \u00e9tait probablement in\u00e9vitable que la position de la CCN serait mentionn\u00e9e lors de la r\u00e9union. J\u2019accepte la position de la CCDP qu\u2019il ressort clairement du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal et du rapport sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 que le choix du site Daly a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la solution privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. Des questions ont n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es quant aux d\u00e9tails des diverses propositions. Ces questions \u00e9taient sinc\u00e8res et interrogatrices. On a \u00e9chang\u00e9 des points de vue.\n[151] Mme Paialunga a reconnu que les co\u00fbts posaient probl\u00e8me. L\u2019esth\u00e9tique \u00e9galement. Toutefois, c\u2019\u00e9tait la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui constituait sa principale pr\u00e9occupation. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le facteur d\u00e9terminant quant \u00e0 la recommandation du site Daly. Cela avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 la principale consid\u00e9ration lorsqu\u2019on avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019installer un ascenseur dans le passage situ\u00e9 entre les marches existantes et l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Les participants \u00e0 la r\u00e9union ont discut\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser l\u2019ascenseur de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught, mais cette utilisation \u00e9tait assortie de conditions, car on pr\u00e9sumait qu\u2019un agent de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 devrait descendre et d\u00e9verrouiller la porte lorsqu\u2019une personne voudrait utiliser l\u2019ascenseur.\nC. Le t\u00e9moignage de Travaux publics (i) Idelle Matte [152] Idelle Matte a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner par Travaux publics quant aux questions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 concernant le site. Elle travaille comme directrice de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 minist\u00e9rielle \u00e0 Travaux publics et elle est responsable de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 physique de tous les \u00e9difices gouvernementaux lou\u00e9s au Canada. Mme Matte a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il y a environ 2 800 \u00e9difices. Travaux publics g\u00e8re environ 2 000 de ces \u00e9difices.\n[153] Mme Matte poss\u00e8de une formation d\u2019analyste de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Elle a suivi une formation de 3 semaines en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par la GRC et elle a re\u00e7u une formation en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 physique. Elle poss\u00e8de un dipl\u00f4me de l\u2019American Society for Industrial Security ainsi qu\u2019un dipl\u00f4me du Coll\u00e8ge Algonquin. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 jointe par Raymond Charette, le gestionnaire de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught, apr\u00e8s que la plainte fut renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, et on lui a demand\u00e9 de faire une analyse de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[154] Le 29 avril 2004, Mme Matte et M. Charette ont fait le tour de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught et ont fait l\u2019analyse. Ils ont port\u00e9 une attention particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019ascenseur qui est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 nord de l\u2019\u00e9difice, lequel permet de se rendre au bureau du ministre. Des r\u00e9serves ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9es quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans cette partie de l\u2019\u00e9difice apr\u00e8s la construction de l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine. L\u2019\u00e9difice n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 construit en fonction des normes d\u2019att\u00e9nuation des explosions. On attend par att\u00e9nuation des explosions, le fait qu\u2019un \u00e9difice soit capable de r\u00e9sister \u00e0 une explosion (une explosion externe) sans s\u2019effondrer. On a \u00e9galement exprim\u00e9 des inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 la couche de protection des fen\u00eatres de l\u2019\u00e9difice.\n[155] Il existe quatre niveau de pr\u00e9paration en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans les installations f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Ces niveaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en place apr\u00e8s les \u00e9v\u00e8nements du 11 septembre 2001. Le premier niveau de pr\u00e9paration en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, la norme minimale, pr\u00e9voit un contr\u00f4le d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux entr\u00e9es de l\u2019\u00e9difice. Il pr\u00e9voit l\u2019identification. Le deuxi\u00e8me niveau pr\u00e9voit la pr\u00e9sence de gardiens aux entr\u00e9es et l\u2019identification par la vue. Les visiteurs doivent \u00eatre escort\u00e9s. Le courrier doit \u00eatre scann\u00e9.\n[156] C\u2019est le deuxi\u00e8me niveau qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. C\u2019est le m\u00eame niveau qui s\u2019applique aux \u00e9difices du Parlement. Mme Matte a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9difice est un \u00e9difice essentiel \u00e0 la mission. C\u2019est \u00e9galement un \u00e9difice du patrimoine. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ajoutent aux pr\u00e9occupations. En th\u00e9orie, les membres du public qui utiliseraient l\u2019ascenseur de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught devraient s\u2019inscrire \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception et \u00eatre escort\u00e9s pour circuler dans l\u2019\u00e9difice.\n[157] Il existe n\u00e9anmoins diff\u00e9rentes zones de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il peut y avoir, par ordre ascendant, une zone d\u2019acc\u00e8s public, une zone de r\u00e9ception, une zone op\u00e9rationnelle, une zone de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et peut\u2011\u00eatre une zone de haute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il se pourrait que cela ait une incidence sur l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019ascenseur.\n[158] La note de service pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par Mme Matte comprenait des commentaires relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019ascenseur existant. Il n\u2019y figurait aucun commentaire sur la construction possible d\u2019un autre ascenseur. Mme Matte affirme n\u00e9anmoins que, si le m\u00eame puits d\u2019ascenseur \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9, ses commentaires seraient les m\u00eames.\nIII. Le droit [159] La pr\u00e9sente instance soul\u00e8ve un certain nombre de questions juridiques. On doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces questions avant de d\u00e9cider si le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Elles sont \u00e9galement pertinentes quant \u00e0 la mesure de redressement.\nA. Les marches de la rue York sont\u2011elles une installation ou un service? [160] La premi\u00e8re question a trait au libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). Cette disposition se lit comme suit :\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\nd\u2019en priver un individu; de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture. 1976-77, ch. 33, art. 5.\nLa CCN pr\u00e9tend que les marches de la rue York ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par cette disposition. Elle pr\u00e9tend, notamment, qu\u2019un escalier n\u2019est ni un service, ni une installation. Les marches sont donc exclues de la port\u00e9e de la Loi.\n[161] Pour ma part, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019analyser les d\u00e9finitions de ces mots. Je conviens avec M. Harnden qu\u2019on aurait tort de d\u00e9crire les marches en tant que telle comme \u00e9tant un service ou une installation. Cela ne met toutefois pas fin \u00e0 la question. L\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne renvoie \u00e0 la fourniture de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement, et c\u2019est le fait de fournir ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui est vis\u00e9 par la Loi.\n[162] La question juridique portant sur le libell\u00e9 de la Loi consiste \u00e0 savoir si la CCN se trouve \u00e0 fournir un service en construisant et en entretenant les marches. Selon moi, cela ne fait aucun doute. Si les marches elles\u2011m\u00eame ne constituent pas un service, elles en fournissent un. Ce service consiste \u00e0 fournir une assistance physique aux personnes qui d\u00e9sirent monter la colline situ\u00e9e entre la promenade Sussex et l\u2019avenue MacKenzie.\n[163] La CCN fournit donc les marches, lesquelles fournissent le service, \u00e0 tout le moins linguistiquement. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un acte continu qui rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application naturel de l\u2019article 5. Le service en question est destin\u00e9 au public. Il s\u2019ensuit que la Loi s\u2019applique et que la CCN n\u2019a pas le droit, en sa qualit\u00e9 de responsable des marches, de d\u00e9favoriser les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\nB. L\u2019article 15 [164] La d\u00e9fense habituelle contre une all\u00e9gation qu\u2019un intim\u00e9 a omis de fournir une mesure d\u2019accommodement tire son origine \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) et au paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n15. (1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\ng) le fait qu\u2019un fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public, ou de locaux commerciaux ou de logements en prive un individu ou le d\u00e9favorise lors de leur fourniture pour un motif de distinction illicite, s\u2019il a un motif justifiable de le faire.\nL\u2019all\u00e9gation est que la CCN a refus\u00e9 au plaignant l\u2019acc\u00e8s au service fourni aux marches de la rue York.\n[165] Le paragraphe 15(2) pr\u00e9cise le sens de l\u2019expression motif justifiable.\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus [\u2026] sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)g), s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nLa pratique en question est la construction des marches de la rue York sans fournir aucun acc\u00e8s aux personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches. Cette pratique est un motif justifiable si la fourniture de l\u2019acc\u00e8s constitue pour les intim\u00e9s une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n(i) Les facteurs mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 15(2) sont\u2011ils exhaustifs? [166] On doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 deux questions pr\u00e9cises en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La premi\u00e8re question consiste \u00e0 savoir si des facteurs autres que la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les co\u00fbts peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s lorsque l\u2019on d\u00e9cide si la fourniture d\u2019un acc\u00e8s imposerait aux intim\u00e9s une contrainte excessive au sens du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne? Je crois qu\u2019il faut r\u00e9pondre par l\u2019affirmative. Les facteurs mentionn\u00e9s dans le paragraphe ne sont pas exhaustifs.\n[167] La Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur la m\u00eame question dans Syndicat des employ\u00e9es et employ\u00e9s professionnelles et professionnels de bureau, section locale 434 (FTQ) c. Gagnon, [2005] J.Q. no 9368. Dans cette cause, la cour traitait d\u2019une affaire dans laquelle un employ\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9, notamment, en raison d\u2019absence m\u00e9dicale. L\u2019employ\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief en invoquant express\u00e9ment les dispositions de l\u2019article 15 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[168] Les faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne sont pas particuli\u00e8rement utiles. Toutefois, au paragraphe 39 de la d\u00e9cision, le juge Marcelin a conclu que la liste des facteurs mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 15(2) n\u2019est pas exhaustive.\nLe paragraphe (2) de l'article 15 est descriptif et non limitatif. Il peut y avoir d'autres crit\u00e8res qui permettent une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\nLa d\u00e9cision du juge Marcelin semble reposer sur la simple observation qu\u2019il est possible de concevoir des facteurs l\u00e9gitimes d\u2019emploi \u2014 c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es \u2014 qui ne rel\u00e8vent pas de la sant\u00e9, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des co\u00fbts.\n[169] Une question semblable s\u2019est pos\u00e9e dans Dominion Colour Corp. c. Teamsters, Local 1880 (Metcalfe Grievance), [1999] O.L.A.A. no 688, 83 L.A.C. (4th) 330, o\u00f9 l\u2019arbitre a examin\u00e9 la disposition \u00e9quivalente figurant dans le Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario. La question de fait dans cette cause consistait \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019employeur \u00e9tait capable de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une employ\u00e9e enceinte qui ne pouvait pas travailler dans un secteur expos\u00e9 au plomb.\n[170] L\u2019arbitre dans la d\u00e9cision Dominion a conclu que les facteurs pr\u00e9vus dans les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pertinentes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas exhaustifs. Elle a invoqu\u00e9, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, la d\u00e9cision rendue par madame la juge Wilson dans Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion que [Traduction] la r\u00e9action pr\u00e9visible de la main\u2011d\u2019\u0153uvre et l\u2019incidence possible sur le moral g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des employ\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre pris en compte pour d\u00e9cider si une mesure d\u2019accommodement imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Un tribunal serait donc appel\u00e9 \u00e0 aller au-del\u00e0 des facteurs mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 15(2).\n[171] Dans Central Alberta Dairy Pool, la juge Wilson \u00e9crit qu\u2019une \u00e9num\u00e9ration de facteurs ne se veut pas exhaustive. Je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019ensuit que toute tentative d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration compl\u00e8te des facteurs qui pourraient s\u2019appliquer lorsque l\u2019on d\u00e9cide ce que constitue une contrainte excessive est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9chouer. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une observation importante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[172] Les facteurs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au paragraphe 15(2) semblent \u00eatre des facteurs li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019emploi. La sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont des questions relatives au milieu de travail. Le paragraphe n\u2019englobe pas l\u2019\u00e9ventail de questions et de pr\u00e9occupations qui sont soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre de la construction d\u2019\u00e9difices, de la pr\u00e9servation de sites historiques et de la fourniture de commodit\u00e9s publiques. Il me semble que les genres de consid\u00e9rations qui sont soulev\u00e9es dans le cas des marches de la rue York sont tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rents des questions qui sont soulev\u00e9es dans des cas d\u2019embauche ou de promotion.\n[173] Je ne crois pas que le paragraphe 15(2) exclue la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres facteurs. Le paragraphe 15(2) ne mentionne pas que la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les co\u00fbts sont les seuls facteurs qui peuvent \u00eatre pris en compte lorsque l\u2019on d\u00e9cide de la forme de mesure d\u2019accommodement qui doit \u00eatre prise. Cela est important en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce parce qu\u2019un certain nombre de facteurs qui sont naturellement soulev\u00e9s dans le contexte de la prise de mesure d\u2019accommodement ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9s dans le paragraphe 15(2).\n[174] Un autre point m\u00e9rite peut\u2011\u00eatre d\u2019\u00eatre signal\u00e9. La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est de nature r\u00e9paratrice. \u00c0 mon avis, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une erreur que d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter de fa\u00e7on trop rigide les dispositions qui attribuent la responsabilit\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s. L\u2019objectif est d\u2019\u00e9liminer la discrimination et non pas de cr\u00e9er des crit\u00e8res artificiels qui ne font que nuire \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des droits et des responsabilit\u00e9s qui entrent en jeu dans le domaine.\n(ii) Le mandat de la CCN doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9 [175] La principale pr\u00e9occupation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est que la Commission de la capitale nationale a son propre mandat qui lui est confi\u00e9 par la Loi sur la capitale nationale. Cela soul\u00e8ve des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes qui doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es lorsque l\u2019on tranche les questions qui sont soulev\u00e9es en vertu de l\u2019article 15 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La port\u00e9e de ces pr\u00e9occupations peut \u00eatre examin\u00e9e, si n\u00e9cessaire, \u00e0 un autre moment.\n[176] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019un statut sp\u00e9cial qui l\u2019exclut du domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux lois ordinaires. Les autres lois doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et aux dispositions expresses de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La CCN est oblig\u00e9e de s\u2019acquitter de son mandat d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui est conforme aux obligations de l\u2019\u00c9tat qui sont pr\u00e9vues dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[177] Toutefois, selon moi, un corollaire logique d\u00e9coule de cette affirmation. La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne n\u2019est pas isol\u00e9e des autres instruments juridiques qui peuvent avoir une incidence sur une situation particuli\u00e8re. Selon moi, il n\u2019y a rien dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne qui annulerait ou att\u00e9nuerait d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre les responsabilit\u00e9s de la CCN qui sont pr\u00e9vues dans la Loi sur la capitale nationale. Au contraire, je crois que le principe de l\u2019uniformit\u00e9 en interpr\u00e9tation des lois exige que Loi sur la capitale nationale et la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne soient interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des lois compl\u00e9mentaires.\n[178] Il s\u2019ensuit que les obligations pr\u00e9vues par la loi de la CCN doivent \u00eatre prises en compte lorsque l\u2019on d\u00e9cide ce que constitue un accommodement raisonnable au sens du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cela est important parce qu\u2019il est devenu manifeste au cours de l\u2019audience que les facteurs historiques et esth\u00e9tiques \u00e9taient des consid\u00e9rations importantes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[179] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de personne mentionne que la d\u00e9termination de ce qui constitue un accommodement raisonnable exige une pond\u00e9ration de facteurs. Cela ne peut \u00eatre fait qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que les parties aient particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un processus d\u2019accommodement ad\u00e9quat qui fait ressortir ces facteurs. Si je comprends bien, la CCN croit qu\u2019elle est tenue par la loi d\u2019examiner les facteurs historiques, culturels et esth\u00e9tiques en d\u00e9cidant comment am\u00e9nager les sites qui rel\u00e8vent de son administration.\n[180] Je crois que le concept juridique d\u2019accommodement est suffisamment vaste pour comprendre l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019acc\u00e8s devrait \u00eatre fourni tout en tenant compte des valeurs architecturales et esth\u00e9tiques qui entrent en jeu dans le cadre d\u2019un site particulier. J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage des architectes qu\u2019il est important de prot\u00e9ger le bassin visuel. J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage que les marches devraient s\u2019harmoniser avec l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine. Ce genre de consid\u00e9ration rel\u00e8ve des param\u00e8tres normaux de projets semblables.\nC. Le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie [181] La deuxi\u00e8me question soulev\u00e9e par le paragraphe 15(2) a trait au crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie. J\u2019ai r\u00e9cemment trait\u00e9 de ce crit\u00e8re dans Sosnowski c. TPSGC, 2005 TCDP 47 (2005\/12\/09) et je n\u2019ai pas l\u2019intention d\u2019en ajouter d\u2019avantage en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. N\u00e9anmoins, il y a lieu d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction entre la pr\u00e9sente cause et Sosnowski, car la pr\u00e9sente cause est soulev\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 15 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[182] Selon l\u2019analyse conventionnelle en droit de la personne, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve doit d\u00e9montrer que le plaignant a besoin d\u2019une mesure d\u2019accommodement. Une fois cela \u00e9tabli, c\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019il incombe d\u2019\u00e9tablir que la prise de cette mesure lui imposerait une contrainte excessive au sens du paragraphe 15(2).\n[183] J\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 clairement dans Sosnowski que, selon moi, l\u2019analyse conventionnelle est erron\u00e9e. Selon moi, le fardeau fondamental de la preuve \u2013 parfois appel\u00e9 le fardeau de persuasion \u2014 dans une cause de discrimination, continue d\u2019incomber \u00e0 la personne qui pr\u00e9tend, tout au long de l\u2019audience, avoir fait l\u2019objet de discrimination. La partie qui poursuit doit prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa cause. Le fardeau de la preuve lui incombe toujours.\n[184] Le TCDP adopte une position diff\u00e9rente. M. Dufresne m\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Maksteel Qu\u00e9bec Inc., [2003] 3 R.C.S. 228, paragraphe 53, o\u00f9 la Cour supr\u00eame semble de toute \u00e9vidence pr\u00e9sumer que le fardeau de la preuve incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le probl\u00e8me est que la Cour ne discute pas s\u00e9rieusement de la question. De plus, il est manifeste, \u00e0 la fin de la d\u00e9cision, que la Cour supr\u00eame croit que le fardeau de la preuve incombe au plaignant.\n[185] Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re la position de la CCN. M. Harnden m\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un passage tir\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9dition en feuilles mobiles de William Pentney, ed., Discrimination and the Law (Thompson Carswell), paragraphe 15.2d)(iii). D\u00e8s qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, M. Pentney \u00e9crit ce qui suit concernant le fardeau de la preuve :\n[Traduction]\n[...] le juge McDonald dans BaseFort Patrol Ltd. c. Alberta Human Rights Commission (1982), 4 CHRR D\/1200 a affirm\u00e9 que c\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019il incombe de fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve s\u2019il veut \u00e9viter qu\u2019une conclusion d\u00e9favorable soit tir\u00e9e contre lui. Toutefois, dans un sens secondaire, c\u2019est toujours au plaignant qu\u2019incombe le fardeau de la preuve.\nIl est difficile d\u2019imaginer une r\u00e8gle de droit plus fondamentale qui garantit l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus.\n[186] L\u2019objet initial du crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie \u00e9tait de d\u00e9cider, lorsque la partie qui poursuit avait termin\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve, s\u2019il y avait une preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer. Si une preuve prima facie \u00e9tait \u00e9tablie, la cour d\u00e9cidait alors la cause sur le fond. Selon le juge McDonald, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devait pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou prendre le risque qu\u2019une conclusion d\u00e9favorable soit tir\u00e9e contre lui. Un intim\u00e9 qui pr\u00e9sente sa preuve pr\u00e9sume essentiellement qu\u2019il y a preuve prima facie.\n[187] J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9 cet aspect de l\u2019affaire dans Sosnowski. Le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie a historiquement \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que la partie qui poursuit a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa preuve. Il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019instance, apr\u00e8s que les deux parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur preuve. Le probl\u00e8me est que l\u2019utilisation du crit\u00e8re \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape du processus occulte in\u00e9vitablement la v\u00e9ritable t\u00e2che du Tribunal. Cette t\u00e2che consiste tout simplement \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, si le plaignant a prouv\u00e9 le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de sa cause selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[188] On ne sait pas exactement pourquoi une grande partie de la jurisprudence semble adopter la position que le fardeau de la preuve\u2014et, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je parle du fardeau de persuasion\u2014incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e8s qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. La seule explication qui me vient \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, c\u2019est que de nombreux tribunaux ont implicitement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que le plaignant s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 d\u2019un certain fardeau de preuve en satisfaisant au crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une erreur manifeste.\n[189] La preuve n\u2019est pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e dans le cadre de la preuve prima facie. Il n\u2019y a aucun fardeau de la preuve. Le plaignant peut avoir une cause douteuse, une cause apparemment non fond\u00e9e, voir m\u00eame une cause non fond\u00e9e et n\u2019avoir aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie. Le plaignant peut continuer et perdre la cause sur le fond m\u00eame si l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9sente aucune preuve. Pourquoi, alors, le fardeau de persuasion devrait\u2011il incomber \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie? Je ne peux trouver aucune r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante \u00e0 cette question. Il n\u2019y a rien dans le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie qui suffit \u00e0 d\u00e9placer le fardeau de la preuve et \u00e0 le faire reposer sur les \u00e9paules de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[190] Cela ne change rien aux exigences pr\u00e9vues dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le paragraphe 15(2) n\u2019impose pas un fardeau explicite \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le paragraphe pr\u00e9voit tout simplement ce qui suit :\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus [\u2026] sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)g), s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nSelon moi, cette disposition s\u2019adresse autant au Tribunal qu\u2019aux parties. Elle met en garde les membres du Tribunal de ne pas se livrer \u00e0 des conjectures.\n[191] La d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vue par le paragraphe 15(2) est tout simplement qu\u2019il serait d\u00e9raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9ponde aux besoins du plaignant. D\u2019un point de vue pratique, un intim\u00e9 trouvera probablement difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir cela sans pr\u00e9senter aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. M\u00eame si l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas le fardeau de la preuve. Il lui incombe toujours de s\u2019expliquer. J\u2019affirme ceci parce qu\u2019il doit exister des causes o\u00f9 il peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que les mesures d\u2019accommodement constitueraient une contrainte excessive sans que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019ait \u00e0 en faire la preuve.\n[192] M. Pentney pr\u00e9f\u00e8re faire la distinction entre le fardeau de la preuve et le fardeau de pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve. Ces deux fardeaux remplissent sensiblement le m\u00eame r\u00f4le. Ils imposent \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019obligation de s\u2019expliquer tout en imposant le fardeau de la preuve au plaignant. L\u2019objectif est le m\u00eame dans les deux cas. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne fournit aucune explication au sens du paragraphe 15(2), un tribunal peut tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable contre lui. En droit, du moins, ce genre de conclusion peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une preuve positive de discrimination.\n[193] Je ne suis pas certain qu\u2019il y ait une raison d\u2019aller aussi loin. Apr\u00e8s tout, si la somme totale des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal d\u00e9montrent que le plaignant a droit \u00e0 des mesures d\u2019accommodement et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a fourni aucune explication, je ne vois pas pourquoi le Tribunal rejetterais une plainte. En effet, j\u2019aurais cru que le paragraphe 15(2) exige que la plainte soit \u00e9tay\u00e9e.\n[194] Il y a peut\u2011\u00eatre d\u2019autres mani\u00e8res d\u2019analyser la situation. Je demeure toutefois convaincu que le fardeau de la preuve incombe \u00e0 la m\u00eame partie qu\u2019au d\u00e9but du processus. Comme M. Pentney l\u2019\u00e9crit dans le m\u00eame passage :\n[Traduction]\n[...] les distinctions qu\u2019il faut faire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce entre les d\u00e9fenses d\u2019exception pr\u00e9vues par la loi et les autres d\u00e9fenses, et entre le fardeau de la preuve et le fardeau de pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9serv\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re scrupuleuse si on veut que les proc\u00e9dures de la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate r\u00e9pondent aux normes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 commun\u00e9ment reconnues [...]\nIl s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019un tribunal doit \u00e9viter d\u2019imposer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 des obligations de pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve qui pourraient avoir pour cons\u00e9quence de renverser le fardeau de la preuve.\nD. Meiorin : les principes de la conception universelle [195] Ensuite, une question se pose en rapport avec l\u2019approche g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui devrait \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La CCDP m\u2019a demand\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer les crit\u00e8res \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie\u2011Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3, commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin en raison du nom de la plaignante. Hormis les diff\u00e9rences factuelles entre les deux causes, je crois que la pr\u00e9sente cause est relativement simple et n\u2019exige pas ce genre d\u2019analyse.\n[196] Un certain nombre des commentaires formul\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin sont n\u00e9anmoins d\u2019application plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Au paragraphe 68, par exemple, la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\nEn adoptant des lois sur les droits de la personne et en pr\u00e9voyant leur application au milieu de travail, les l\u00e9gislatures ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les normes r\u00e9gissant l'ex\u00e9cution du travail devraient tenir compte de tous les membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est raisonnablement possible de le faire. Les cours de justice et les tribunaux administratifs doivent avoir cela \u00e0 l'esprit lorsqu'ils sont saisis d'une demande dans laquelle l'existence de discrimination li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'emploi est all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. La norme qui fait inutilement abstraction des diff\u00e9rences entre les personnes va \u00e0 l'encontre des interdictions contenues dans les diverses lois sur les droits de la personne et doit \u00eatre remplac\u00e9e.\nIl existe un point de comparaison dans les normes physiques adopt\u00e9es par la CCN quant aux installations qui rel\u00e8vent de son contr\u00f4le.\n[197] Toutes les parties ont accept\u00e9 que les principes de la conception universelle \u00e9tablissent le cadre d\u2019analyse qui devrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour d\u00e9cider quelle forme d\u2019accommodement convient le mieux \u00e0 un cas particulier. La CCN informe r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement les autres minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux quant \u00e0 leur obligation de respect de ces principes.\n[198] Il y a un point de droit ici. Les principes de la conception universelle d\u00e9coulent de la m\u00eame notion d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui se trouve au c\u0153ur de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il me semble que les principes de la conception universelle peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant une \u00e9laboration naturelle de la notion d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, en dehors du droit, dans le domaine de l\u2019architecture et de l\u2019am\u00e9nagement. Je ne vois pas pourquoi on ne peut pas leur accorder le m\u00eame genre de force que la coutume et la pratique re\u00e7oivent dans d\u2019autres domaines du droit.\n[199] Il y a une question mineure ici. Il est devenu \u00e9vident durant l\u2019audience que les principes de la conception universelle peuvent \u00eatre formul\u00e9s d\u2019un certain nombre de mani\u00e8res. Cela ne semble pas violer le consensus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui existe quant aux pr\u00e9ceptes fondamentaux qui devraient figurer dans toute compilation de ces principes. Pour les fins de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je crois qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de se servir de l\u2019annexe jointe au rapport de M. Rapson dans laquelle figure un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 utile de ces principes.\nE. L\u2019obligation de fournir des mesures d\u2019accommodement : le caract\u00e8re raisonnable [200] La jurisprudence qui traite des mesures d\u2019accommodement a mis principalement l\u2019accent sur les exceptions fond\u00e9es sur la bonne foi. Pour ma part, je crois qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, \u00e0 tout le moins, de commencer par un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du droit. Cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 est tout simplement que, en vertu de l\u2019article 15 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit fournir des mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnable. Il serait d\u00e9raisonnable d\u2019exiger plus que cela.\n[201] Je souscris \u00e0 cette position de la CCN sur ce point. Les obligations figurant dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne vont pas au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019exigence qu\u2019un intim\u00e9 fournisse des mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnables. La CCN est tenue par la loi d\u2019offrir \u00e0 M. Brown ainsi qu\u2019aux autres personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches de la rue York une solution de rechange raisonnable. C\u2019est tout ce qu\u2019elle est tenue de faire.\n[202] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu qu\u2019il n\u2019existe qu\u2019une seule norme quant \u00e0 l\u2019accommodement. Dans Commission scolaire r\u00e9gionale de Chambly c. Bergevin [1994] 2 R.C.S. 525, page 546. Le juge Cory \u00e9crit ce qui suit en renvoyant \u00e0 la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne :\nIl importe de se rappeler que l'obligation d'accommodement est limit\u00e9e par les mots raisonnable et sans s'imposer de contrainte excessive. Il s'agit l\u00e0 non pas de crit\u00e8res ind\u00e9pendants, mais plut\u00f4t de diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons d'exprimer le m\u00eame concept.\nLe juge Cory renvoie ensuite \u00e0 un passage \u00e9quivalent figurant dans Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, page 984.\n[203] La Cour supr\u00eame a indiqu\u00e9 clairement que le concept de contrainte excessive ne cr\u00e9e pas une norme juridique ind\u00e9pendante. La norme juridique est celle du caract\u00e8re raisonnable. Toute interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019expression contrainte excessive qui impose un fardeau d\u00e9raisonnable \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre appuy\u00e9e.\n[204] La difficult\u00e9 semble r\u00e9sider dans le fait que le caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une forme particuli\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement est relatif. Cela d\u00e9pend de la situation. Le concept de contrainte excessive constitue donc un instrument de mesure qu\u2019un tribunal peut utiliser pour d\u00e9cider si un plaignant en demande trop.\n[205] Je pr\u00e9sume que le l\u00e9gislateur a choisi la contrainte excessive comme norme d\u00e9cisive parce que la fourniture de mesures d\u2019accommodement entra\u00eenera obligatoirement un certain degr\u00e9 de contrainte. Cela est in\u00e9luctable. Je ne crois toutefois pas que l\u00e9gislateur voulait faire dispara\u00eetre la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable. C\u2019est la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable qui est d\u00e9cisive et non pas le concept de contrainte excessive. M. Harnden a invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Hutchinson c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Environnement), [2003] 4 C.F. 580, dans laquelle la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la question de contrainte excessive ne se pose pas si un intim\u00e9 offre \u00e0 un plaignant des solutions de rechange raisonnables. Je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une autre fa\u00e7on de dire la m\u00eame chose.\n[206] La d\u00e9cision Hutchinson illustre n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019il existe deux moyens de d\u00e9fense. Le premier moyen de d\u00e9fense est que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a agi d\u2019une mani\u00e8re raisonnable. La CCN pr\u00e9tend en l\u2019instance qu\u2019elle a fourni au plaignant des mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnables. Le deuxi\u00e8me moyen de d\u00e9fense est que la demande d\u2019accommodement imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sens du paragraphe 15(2). L\u2019implication juridique est que cela est d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[207] La distinction entre les deux moyens de d\u00e9fense semble avoir disparu dans la jurisprudence, laquelle a eu tendance \u00e0 tout faire reposer sur l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue par la loi. Il est vrai qu\u2019il y a un chevauchement. La pr\u00e9sente instance comprend des \u00e9l\u00e9ments des deux moyens de d\u00e9fense. Le principal argument de la CCN est que l\u2019ascenseur du site Daly constitue un accommodement raisonnable. La d\u00e9fense de contrainte excessive est n\u00e9anmoins l\u00e0, \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re\u2011plan.\n[208] Le seul point que je tiens \u00e0 souligner est que les deux moyens de d\u00e9fense peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une distinction. Il s\u2019ensuit que le premier moyen de d\u00e9fense n\u2019exige aucune preuve de contrainte excessive. Cela peut para\u00eetre avantageux pour un intim\u00e9, car c\u2019est au plaignant qu\u2019incombe enti\u00e8rement le fardeau de la preuve. La diff\u00e9rence est toutefois illusoire si le Tribunal fait reposer le fardeau de la preuve l\u00e0 o\u00f9, selon le droit, il a toujours repos\u00e9.\n[209] La question de savoir ce qui est raisonnable d\u00e9pend des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. On m\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9dition \u00e0 feuilles mobiles de The Duty to Accommodate in Employment (Canada Law Book), ed. Kevin D. MacNeill, \u00a7. 11:30, o\u00f9 le r\u00e9dacteur renvoie \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions \u00e9tayant la proposition que la question de savoir ce qui constitue une contrainte excessive exige une pond\u00e9ration de facteurs ainsi qu\u2019un processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Tous les facteurs pertinents doivent \u00eatre pris en compte et \u00e9valu\u00e9s les uns en regard des autres lorsque l\u2019on d\u00e9cide si une forme particuli\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement est raisonnable. Il me semble qu\u2019il y a une question de proportionnalit\u00e9 li\u00e9e \u00e0 ceci. Cela exige un exercice de jugement, ce qui est la responsabilit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re du Tribunal, et touche \u00e0 l\u2019essence du processus juridictionnel.\n[210] Ces commentaires ne devraient pas \u00eatre mal appliqu\u00e9s. On m\u2019a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Re Mount Sinai Hospital and Ontario Nurses\u2019 Association (1996), 54 LAC (4th) 261, dans laquelle l\u2019Association des infirmi\u00e8res de l\u2019Ontario cherchait un poste d\u2019infirmi\u00e8re pour une employ\u00e9e bless\u00e9e. La formation d\u2019arbitres a jug\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 273, que les co\u00fbts de l\u2019accommodement doivent \u00eatre compar\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019avantage qui en r\u00e9sulterait, afin de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il constitue une contrainte excessive. Elle a ensuite affirm\u00e9 que la contrainte serait excessive dans les causes [Traduction] o\u00f9 l\u2019inconv\u00e9nient \u00e9limin\u00e9 par l\u2019accommodement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 serait n\u00e9gligeable par rapport aux co\u00fbts engendr\u00e9s par son \u00e9limination.\n[211] Ce genre d\u2019analogie n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La CCN a cr\u00e9\u00e9 l\u2019inconv\u00e9nient qu\u2019elle doit maintenant \u00e9liminer. On aurait tort de la laisser invoquer sa propre turpitude et pr\u00e9tendre que l\u2019inconv\u00e9nient est \u00e0 ce point n\u00e9gligeable que les co\u00fbts engendr\u00e9s par son \u00e9limination ne seraient pas justifi\u00e9s. Il est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public de permettre \u00e0 une partie d\u2019invoquer son propre manquement \u00e0 la Loi comme moyen de d\u00e9fense contre une plainte de discrimination.\nF. L\u2019obligation de consulter [212] L\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement comprend l\u2019obligation de consulter. La CCDP a pr\u00e9tendu que la CCN [Traduction] doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a suivi le processus ad\u00e9quat. Il s\u2019agit probablement de la principale question en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[213] Dans la jurisprudence, la plus grande partie du d\u00e9bat concernant l\u2019obligation de consulter porte sur l\u2019emploi. Par exemple, dans Conte c. Rogers Cablesystems Ltd., (1999) D.T. 4\/99, paragraphe 77, le Tribunal a conclu ce qui suit :\nComme la responsabilit\u00e9 du lieu de travail incombe \u00e0 l\u2019employeur, c\u2019est lui qui doit amorcer le processus d\u2019accommodement. L\u2019employeur est tenu, tout au moins, de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen de l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel de l\u2019employ\u00e9, de son pronostic de gu\u00e9rison et de sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer d\u2019autres fonctions\nSelon moi, cela donne une id\u00e9e des obligations auxquelles un intim\u00e9 est tenu dans les causes relatives \u00e0 l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9.\n[214] L\u2019analogie entre les causes portant sur l\u2019emploi et les causes portant sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s physique est boiteuse. L\u2019obligation d\u2019accommoder un employ\u00e9 d\u00e9coule de la relation juridique qui existe entre un employeur et un employ\u00e9. Chacune des parties a des responsabilit\u00e9s et des obligations. Les obligations d\u2019un organisme public comme la CCN de fournir l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 un parc public sont distinctes et de nature diff\u00e9rente.\n[215] La jurisprudence la plus pertinente dans le domaine semble \u00eatre la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Grismer, r\u00e9pertori\u00e9e sous Colombie\u2011Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868. Dans Grismer, le Surintendant des v\u00e9hicules automobiles a annul\u00e9 le permis de conduire du demandeur parce que celui\u2011ci \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une maladie appel\u00e9e h\u00e9mianopsie homonyme, laquelle a entra\u00een\u00e9 une perte de presque toute sa vision p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche des deux yeux. Il \u00e9tait interdit aux personnes atteintes de cette maladie de d\u00e9tenir un permis de conduire.\n[216] La question en litige dans cette cause \u00e9tait l\u2019accommodement. Le B.C. Council of Human Rights a ordonn\u00e9 au Surintendant de faire subir \u00e0 M. Grismer une \u00e9valuation individuelle afin de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il avait droit de d\u00e9tenir un permis de conduire et de savoir si le permis devrait \u00eatre assujetti \u00e0 des restrictions. La cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e en appel et elle a finalement abouti en Cour supr\u00eame, laquelle a appliqu\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re Meiorin.\n[217] La ratio decidendi de l\u2019arr\u00eat est toutefois plus simple. Au paragraphe 44, la Juge en chef McLaughlin a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\nLe pr\u00e9sent arr\u00eat ne porte que sur le droit \u00e0 l'accommodement. On n'y conclut pas que M. Grismer avait droit \u00e0 un permis de conduire. Il [page894] \u00e9tablit seulement que ce dernier avait le droit d'\u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9. C'est tout ce que le membre a conclu, et c'est tout ce que nous affirmons. La discrimination en l'esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9coule non pas du refus de d\u00e9livrer un permis de conduire \u00e0 M. Grismer, mais plut\u00f4t du refus de lui donner simplement la chance de d\u00e9montrer qu'il \u00e9tait possible de l'accommoder sans compromettre l'objectif de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re raisonnable vis\u00e9 par le Surintendant.\nLe Surintendant des v\u00e9hicules automobiles n'a pos\u00e9 aucun geste susceptible de constituer une mesure d'accommodement.\n[218] La situation dont je suis saisi en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce concerne le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une seule personne. Il existe n\u00e9anmoins des points communs avec l\u2019arr\u00eat Grismer. M. Brown et la CCDP affirment qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de v\u00e9ritable enqu\u00eate sur la situation. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette affirmation. Je souscris n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation que la CCN n\u2019a pas tenu une s\u00e9rie de consultations ad\u00e9quates. On n\u2019a pas vraiment permis aux personnes qui avaient besoin de l\u2019accommodement d\u2019exprimer leurs opinions.\n[219] Les points communs avec l\u2019arr\u00eat Grismer sont r\u00e9els. Au paragraphe 43 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Grismer, la Juge en chef \u00e9crit que le Surintendant des v\u00e9hicules automobiles :\n[...] \u00e9tait tenu de donner \u00e0 M. Grismer la possibilit\u00e9 de prouver qu'il pouvait conduire de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire en lui faisant subir une \u00e9valuation individuelle.\nLe d\u00e9faut de consulter M. Grismer et de lui donner l\u2019occasion de se faire entendre \u00e9tait lui\u2011m\u00eame discriminatoire. Il s'ensuit que le bien-fond\u00e9 de l'accusation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la Human Rights Act a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli.\n[220] Je d\u00e9duis de l\u2019arr\u00eat Grismer que la premi\u00e8re obligation d\u2019accommodement est l\u2019obligation de tenir un processus de consultation ad\u00e9quat. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit faire enqu\u00eate sur l\u2019affaire et doit obtenir les points de vue des personnes qui ont besoin d\u2019accommodement. J\u2019irais m\u00eame jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dire qu\u2019il y a un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de justice naturelle dans ce processus. Il doit y avoir un \u00e9change ouvert d\u2019opinions et les personnes qui ont besoin d\u2019accommodement devraient se voir offrir la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations qui pourraient emp\u00eacher l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir l\u2019accommodement qu\u2019elles recherchent.\n[221] La CCN est tenue de se renseigner sur les situations qui sont susceptibles de cr\u00e9er de la discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Il y a une autre obligation qui est celle d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur ces situations et d\u2019examiner \u00e0 fond les solutions possibles. Cette obligation comprend le devoir de consulter d\u2019une mani\u00e8re transparente et sinc\u00e8re les groupes de personnes qui peuvent \u00eatre touch\u00e9es. Il doit y avoir un v\u00e9ritable processus de consultation : les pr\u00e9occupations et les opinions l\u00e9gitimes de la collectivit\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre pris en compte lorsque l\u2019on d\u00e9cide quelle mesure d\u2019accommodement il convient de fournir.\n[222] Je r\u00e9alise que la d\u00e9fense qui m\u2019est soumise est que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fourni un accommodement raisonnable. Cela peut ou non avoir une influence sur le devoir de consulter. Je crois n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019un certain degr\u00e9 de consultation constitue un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de tout processus d\u2019accommodement. Il me semble qu\u2019un intim\u00e9 devra discuter de la question avec la personne qui demande un accommodement, si ce n\u2019est que pour d\u00e9cider quelle forme d\u2019accommodement il convient de fournir. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le processus qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait insuffisant.\n[223] J\u2019aimerais faire un dernier commentaire. La CCN a reconnu, en toute justice, que la consultation publique fait partie int\u00e9grale de l\u2019am\u00e9nagement sans obstacle. Elle a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 de la jurisprudence qui enseigne que le processus de consultation est un processus de collaboration. Les autres parties doivent se voir offrir la pleine possibilit\u00e9 de participer. Cela est pour le mieux. Toutefois, au bout du compte, l\u2019ensemble des parties doivent reconna\u00eetre que la CCN est la responsable des marches de la rue York. C\u2019est \u00e0 la CCN qu\u2019incombe la responsabilit\u00e9 juridique de prendre des d\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 la conception, le contr\u00f4le et l\u2019entretien des marches de la rue York.\nIV. La responsabilit\u00e9 : les arguments avanc\u00e9s contre la CCN [224] Les droits de la personne commencent par la reconnaissance que toutes les personnes sont \u00e9gales. Il s\u2019ensuit que toute analyse de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce doit partir du principe que l\u2019obligation de la CCN de voir \u00e0 l\u2019entretien et \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9nagement de la r\u00e9gion de la capitale nationale doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience soient trait\u00e9es de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que les autres personnes. Tout le monde jouit du m\u00eame droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s en vertu de l\u2019article 2 de la Loi.\n[225] La CCN est tenue d\u2019accommoder les personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches de la rue York. Cette obligation comprend l\u2019obligation de consulter, d\u2019une quelconque fa\u00e7on, les personnes, les associations et les groupes qui peuvent exprimer les opinions et les pr\u00e9occupations de ces personnes. Il n\u2019existe aucune r\u00e8gle stricte quant \u00e0 savoir qui devrait \u00eatre consult\u00e9.\n[226] La principale question dont je suis saisi en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, consiste \u00e0 savoir si le processus de consultation \u00e9tait juridiquement convenable. Il ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas. Je suis convaincu selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s que la CCN ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e des obligations qui lui incombaient en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il semble injuste d\u2019affirmer que le processus de consultation \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. Il semble plus juste d\u2019affirmer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait insuffisant.\n[227] Je suis \u00e9galement convaincu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la CCN a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Brown et des autres personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Un certain nombre d\u2019observations contribuent \u00e0 ces conclusions.\nA. Les marches de la rue York ne sont pas accessibles [228] La premi\u00e8re observation est que les marches de la rue York ne sont pas accessibles. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une conclusion de fait et d\u2019une conclusion juridique. La CCN n\u2019a pr\u00e9vu aucune mesure d\u2019accommodement destin\u00e9e aux personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches. M. Brown et les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience ne disposent d\u2019aucun moyen, aux marches de la rue York, de monter la colline et d\u2019entrer dans le parc Major. Il y a donc discrimination \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard \u00e0 cet endroit.\n[229] Dans ses observations finales, la CCN a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de rendre les marches accessibles. Les intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9tendu que les pi\u00e9tons qui montent les marches se dirigent en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale vers le Ch\u00e2teau Laurier et la Colline parlementaire plut\u00f4t que vers le parc Major. Ces personnes auraient avantage \u00e0 emprunter le site Daly. Personne ne conteste cela. M\u00eame M. Rapson a convenu qu\u2019il serait plus avantageux pour les personnes qui se rendent sur la Colline parlementaire d\u2019emprunter le site Daly.\n[230] La position de l\u2019autre partie est tout simplement que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne interdit \u00e0 la CCN de faire une distinction entre les personnes qui sont capables de monter les marches et les personnes qui sont incapables de les monter. La question en litige est la parit\u00e9. La CCN ne peut pas affirmer que les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience n\u2019ont besoin d\u2019aucune mesure d\u2019acc\u00e8s entre la rue York et la promenade Sussex afin d\u2019acc\u00e9der au parc Major. Si les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience n\u2019ont besoin d\u2019aucune mesure d\u2019acc\u00e8s qui m\u00e8ne au parc Major, on peut dire la m\u00eame chose des personnes n\u2019ayant aucune d\u00e9ficience. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public est le m\u00eame dans les deux cas.\n[231] La question dont je suis saisi est donc tr\u00e8s simple. Il s\u2019agit de savoir si la CCN a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience, comme M. Brown, qui d\u00e9sirent avoir un acc\u00e8s au parc Major \u00e9gal \u00e0 celui dont jouissent les autres membres du public. La r\u00e9ponse de la CCN est que le site Daly constitue un acc\u00e8s acceptable. Cette affirmation n\u2019est aucunement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve.\n[232] Selon M. Rapson, l\u2019ascenseur du site Daly est situ\u00e9 trop loin. Cela n\u2019est pas \u00e9quitable et contrevient donc \u00e0 l\u2019un des principes fondamentaux de la conception universelle. La distance \u00e0 parcourir\u2014par les personnes qui \u00e9prouvent le plus de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer\u2014pr\u00e9sente un v\u00e9ritable probl\u00e8me. Il me semble que tout fardeau additionnel devrait \u00eatre impos\u00e9 aux personnes qui sont le plus en mesure de s\u2019en acquitter.\n[233] M. Martin a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019utilisation du site Daly exigerait un parcours additionnel de 284 m\u00e8tres. C\u2019est une distance de 284 m\u00e8tres que les autres personnes n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 parcourir. L\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur \u00e0 cent m\u00e8tres plus loin sur la rue ne constitue pas un accommodement valable. La moiti\u00e9 de cette distance serait trop grande. Je suis convaincu que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne exige que la mesure d\u2019accommodement soit situ\u00e9e tout pr\u00e8s des marches et non pas situ\u00e9e un p\u00e2t\u00e9 de maisons plus loin.\n[234] Il s\u2019agit peut\u2011\u00eatre d\u2019une question de vocabulaire. Je ne comprends pas comment on peut affirmer que l\u2019ascenseur du site Daly permet \u00e0 une personne en fauteuil roulant d\u2019acc\u00e9der au parc Major par le site des marches de la rue York. Certaines choses sautent aux yeux. Le site Daly est un tout autre lieu. L\u2019ascenseur du site Daly peut permettre d\u2019acc\u00e9der au parc Major \u00e0 partir de la rue situ\u00e9e en bas, mais il serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019affirmer qu\u2019il constitue une mesure d\u2019accommodement situ\u00e9e sur le lieu m\u00eame des marches de la rue York. Il n\u2019y a tout simplement aucun acc\u00e8s sur le lieu m\u00eame des marches de la rue York.\n[235] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le vraiment que les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience doivent faire un d\u00e9tour que les autres personnes n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 faire. Elles doivent emprunter un autre chemin et passer par un autre endroit. Il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019une forme raisonnable d\u2019accommodement. La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 est que la CCN a tout simplement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but qu\u2019il suffirait de pr\u00e9voir un acc\u00e8s sur le lieu du site Daly. Il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une erreur de droit. Je ne vois pas comment on pourrait affirmer que l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur sur le site Daly r\u00e9pondrait \u00e0 l\u2019exigence de fourniture d\u2019un accommodement mentionn\u00e9e dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[236] Les faits de chaque esp\u00e8ce sont diff\u00e9rents. Il n\u2019est toutefois pas contest\u00e9 que la CCN est tenue de fournir un accommodement raisonnable. Je crois que, logiquement, il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019un intim\u00e9 devrait fournir l\u2019acc\u00e8s exig\u00e9 par les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience le plus pr\u00e8s possible du lieu o\u00f9 celles\u2011ci en ont besoin. Il serait d\u00e9raisonnable de faire moins que cela. Tout acc\u00e8s devrait \u00eatre convenable, situ\u00e9 le plus proche possible et respecter les principes de l\u2019acc\u00e8s universel.\n[237] La question sociale en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de la s\u00e9paration. La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne repose sur le principe que les personnes doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9. Il en d\u00e9coule que les personnes doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es, autant que faire se peut, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re. Il va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019esprit de la Loi de s\u00e9parer les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience des autres personnes dans les situations o\u00f9 cela n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question de dignit\u00e9, physique et psychologique. Cela rappelle aux personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience qu\u2019elles ne cadrent pas.\n[238] Je suis convaincu, compte tenu des faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce que l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux marches de la rue York devrait \u00eatre fourni dans le voisinage imm\u00e9diat des marches, et probablement sur le lieu m\u00eame o\u00f9 sont situ\u00e9es les marches. Il y a place \u00e0 interpr\u00e9tation. Il me semble que, aux fins de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, on peut consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught fait partie du m\u00eame site que les marches de la rue York.\n[239] La preuve donnait \u00e0 penser, \u00e0 tout le moins, que la fourniture de l\u2019acc\u00e8s sur le site m\u00eame o\u00f9 sont situ\u00e9es les marches imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 la CCN. Cette preuve \u00e9tait toutefois fragmentaire et impr\u00e9cise. Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour constituer une d\u00e9fense.\nB. Le processus de consultation \u00e9tait incomplet [240] La deuxi\u00e8me observation est que le processus de consultation \u00e9tait incomplet. La CCN \u00e9tait tenue de demander l\u2019avis des groupes ou des associations dont ont peut l\u00e9gitimement affirmer qu\u2019elles repr\u00e9sentent les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la collectivit\u00e9 des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience doivent \u00eatre pris en compte tout au long du processus de la conception et de la construction.\n[241] La CCN a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle avait consult\u00e9 la collectivit\u00e9 des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience dans le cadre de la conception des marches de la rue York. Des r\u00e9unions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues avec les parties concern\u00e9es d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. Ces parties \u00e9taient compos\u00e9es du Comit\u00e9 consultatif sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 de la ville d\u2019Ottawa, de l\u2019Association canadienne des parapl\u00e9giques, des Ressources communautaires pour les personnes ayant un handicap et du Centre de vie autonome. On a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir les opinions de la collectivit\u00e9 des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Toutefois, en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, ces discussions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 peu nombreuses et incompl\u00e8tes.\n[242] Le processus de consultation ne s\u2019est pas rendu tr\u00e8s loin. Il semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u, intentionnellement ou non, pour obtenir l\u2019appui des participants. Une seule r\u00e9union, celle du 23 juillet 2002, peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 une consultation ad\u00e9quate. Le d\u00e9roulement de la r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9 et il n\u2019y a pas eu le processus public transparent auquel on serait en droit de s\u2019attendre dans un tel cas.\n[243] La r\u00e9union s\u2019est essentiellement d\u00e9roul\u00e9e \u00e0 huis clos. M. Brown n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9. La CCN a pr\u00e9tendu que cela s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9 comme l\u2019avait propos\u00e9 un conciliateur de la CCDP. Je trouve cela difficile \u00e0 comprendre. Il semble que la CCN ne voulait pas que M. Brown soit pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Il \u00e9tait devenu un adversaire.\n[244] Deux opinions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises quant \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Mme Paialunga a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que tous avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que le site Daly constituait le meilleur choix. Je pr\u00e9sume que c\u2019est une question de degr\u00e9. Aucune contrainte n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e, mais il est \u00e9vident que le processus a \u00e9t\u00e9 noyaut\u00e9 par les opinions de la CCN et des experts\u2011conseils. C\u2019est le site Daly qui a obtenu la faveur lors du processus. M. Warren et le Comit\u00e9 consultatif municipal n\u2019ont jamais vraiment eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019exprimer leurs opinions.\n[245] Le processus de consultation a \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9 par de nombreux facteurs, le principal facteur \u00e9tant que la r\u00e9union du 23 juillet 2002 s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e en fonction d\u2019un ensemble de postulats erron\u00e9s. L\u2019un de ces postulats \u00e9tait que l\u2019ascenseur du site Daly constituerait une forme raisonnable d\u2019accommodement. Cela n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discutable. Un autre postulat \u00e9tait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas question d\u2019utiliser l\u2019ascenseur de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Un autre postulat \u00e9tait que les parties devaient choisir l\u2019une des solutions de rechange mentionn\u00e9es dans le rapport Robertson.\n[246] Ce genre de limites ne sont pas compatibles avec le genre d\u2019enqu\u00eate vis\u00e9e par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il ressort clairement du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Paialunga que, selon elle, on avait le choix entre le site Daly et un ascenseur situ\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des marches. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre. Que pouvait\u2011elle faire? Elle avait des inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019un ascenseur sur le lieu des marches et elle ne voulait pas perdre le choix du site Daly.\n[247] M. Brown et Mme Paialunga ont discut\u00e9 de l\u2019aspect philosophique de la question. Selon M. Brown, le principe de l\u2019autonomie devrait l\u2019emporter sur les autres consid\u00e9rations. Si le seul lieu o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019installer un ascenseur \u00e9tait le lieu situ\u00e9 entre les marches et l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught, alors il approuvait ce choix. L\u2019installation d\u2019un acc\u00e8s au bout d\u2019un passage sombre \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable \u00e0 l\u2019absence d\u2019acc\u00e8s. Les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience devraient avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cider si elles veulent utiliser l\u2019acc\u00e8s qui est fourni.\n[248] Il y a une v\u00e9ritable disjonction ici. Je ne vois pas pourquoi on devait choisir entre un ascenseur situ\u00e9 sur le site Daly et un ascenseur situ\u00e9 sur le site des marches de la rue York. L\u2019ascenseur du site Daly \u00e9tait une question distincte. On pouvait en construire un ou non, peu importe ce qu\u2019on ferait sur le site des marches et la CCN avait tort de mettre la collectivit\u00e9 des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience devant ce genre de choix. Je suis convaincu que cela a gravement min\u00e9 la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 du processus.\n[249] Je ne suis m\u00eame pas certain de comprendre pourquoi l\u2019ascenseur du site Daly figurerait dans la liste des solutions possibles au probl\u00e8me de l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux marches de la rue York. Je sais que la CCN cherchait un lieu situ\u00e9 dans l\u2019ensemble du p\u00e2t\u00e9 de maisons plut\u00f4t que de ne chercher qu\u2019\u00e0 la jonction de la rue York et de la promenade Sussex. Toutefois, ce genre de d\u00e9marche est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement inopportune dans le contexte de l\u2019acc\u00e8s, lequel est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement propre \u00e0 un site particulier.\n[250] Je r\u00e9alise qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une situation facile pour la CCN. En fin de compte, cela n\u2019a pas beaucoup d\u2019importance. La CCN \u00e9tait tenue de consulter les parties pertinentes et de continuer \u00e0 consulter jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que toutes les solutions de rechange raisonnables soient \u00e9puis\u00e9es. Il est impossible de savoir o\u00f9 aurait men\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de consultations transparentes, tenues sous le signe de la collaboration.\nC. Le v\u00e9ritable probl\u00e8me r\u00e9side dans la conception des marches de la rue York [251] La troisi\u00e8me observation est que le v\u00e9ritable probl\u00e8me r\u00e9side dans la conception des marches de la rue York. Je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 de la position \u00e9largie prise par les t\u00e9moins du plaignant et de la CCDP. M. Rapson, par exemple, estimait qu\u2019on avait eu l\u2019occasion de se pencher sur les questions de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 lorsque les nouvelles marches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ues. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une occasion manqu\u00e9e.\n[252] M. Warren a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le site Daly avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la seule solution viable lors de la r\u00e9union du 23 juillet 2002. Cela \u00e9tait frustrant parce que cela ne r\u00e9glait pas le v\u00e9ritable probl\u00e8me, lequel \u00e9tait l\u2019omission de construire un escalier accessible. L\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur sur le site Daly \u00e9tait la meilleure solution qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, mais seulement [Traduction] parce que les marches n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ues de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles soient accessibles par tous lorsqu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construites. Aucune des solutions de rechange pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es lors de la r\u00e9union de juillet 2002 ne r\u00e9glaient le v\u00e9ritable probl\u00e8me, lequel \u00e9tait la conception initiale des marches. Le Comit\u00e9 consultatif municipal, ou qui que ce soit d\u2019autre, ne pouvait pas faire grand\u2011chose.\n[253] Je crois que les t\u00e9moignages de M. H\u00e9bert et de M. Martin confirment cela. La CCN, pour sa part, a essentiellement admis que les marches de la rue York avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 construites sans que l\u2019on ne pr\u00e9voit un acc\u00e8s, et ce, parce qu\u2019on croyait vaguement qu\u2019on installerait probablement un ascenseur sur le site Daly. Cela prouve tout simplement le point que la CCN \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 construire les marches sans pr\u00e9voir d\u2019acc\u00e8s pour le motif qu\u2019elle pourrait \u00e9ventuellement corriger la situation d\u2019une quelconque fa\u00e7on. Il me semble que cette id\u00e9e contrevient explicitement \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[254] Le probl\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 aggrav\u00e9 par la conduite ult\u00e9rieure de la CCN. Bien que des consultations furent tenues apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, M. Martin a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas question de refaire les marches. C\u2019\u00e9tait impensable. Cela ne ferait tout simplement que masquer le v\u00e9ritable probl\u00e8me. Le probl\u00e8me pos\u00e9 par les solutions de rechange pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 23 juillet 2002 \u00e9tait vraiment secondaire. Si l\u2019ascenseur envisag\u00e9 \u00e9tait, par exemple, situ\u00e9 au bout d\u2019une all\u00e9e sombre et \u00e9tait susceptible de pr\u00e9senter un danger, c\u2019est la conception des marches qu\u2019il faudrait bl\u00e2mer. Le probl\u00e8me r\u00e9side dans la construction initiale.\n[255] Je tiens \u00e0 \u00eatre juste. Il ressort clairement du t\u00e9moignage de Jerrold Corush que la CCN a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me de l\u2019acc\u00e8s lorsque les marches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construites. Le probl\u00e8me est qu\u2019elle a fait cela par elle\u2011m\u00eame sans tenir une s\u00e9rie de consultations ad\u00e9quates et sans \u00e9valuer la pleine port\u00e9e des obligations qui lui incombaient en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Ces obligations existaient l\u00e0 o\u00f9 se trouvaient les marches : la d\u00e9cision d\u2019utiliser un ascenseur situ\u00e9 sur le site Daly \u00e9tait vraisemblablement une mani\u00e8re de se soustraire \u00e0 ces obligations.\n[256] Aucune des parties ne conteste le fait que les marches de la rue York ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construites sans qu\u2019un acc\u00e8s ne soit pr\u00e9vu. C\u2019est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 la discrimination r\u00e9side et je ne vois pas comment le fait de pr\u00e9voir un parcours de rechange qui passe par le site Daly corrigerait ce probl\u00e8me. M\u00eame si l\u2019am\u00e9nagement du site Daly avait corrig\u00e9 la situation\u2014ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas\u2014la CCN a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant durant la p\u00e9riode de temps comprise entre l\u2019ach\u00e8vement de la construction des marches et l\u2019installation de l\u2019ascenseur sur le site Daly.\nD. Conclusions [257] J\u2019ai tir\u00e9 les conclusions suivantes. Les marches de la rue York sont une infrastructure publique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 construite dans un lieu de premier plan pour l\u2019usage des visiteurs et des r\u00e9sidents. L\u2019un des avantages qu\u2019elles procurent est l\u2019acc\u00e8s au parc Major, lequel offre une vue panoramique sur les \u00e9cluses du canal Rideau et sur la Colline parlementaire. Aucun acc\u00e8s n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu pour les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\n[258] La CCN a exig\u00e9 qu\u2019un ascenseur soit install\u00e9 sur le site Daly. Il y avait des avantages \u00e0 utiliser le site Daly. L\u2019ascenseur pourrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 24 heures par jour. Le site de la rue York est plus expos\u00e9 aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments que le site Daly; le site Daly serait plus s\u00e9curitaire et probablement plus pratique pour les personnes qui d\u00e9sirent visiter la Colline parlementaire. Tout cela n\u2019est pas pertinent. La situation aux marches est demeur\u00e9e telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait avant que le site Daly ne soit construit.\n[259] Le passage par le site Daly constitue plus qu\u2019un simple d\u00e9tour. L\u2019acc\u00e8s fourni par l\u2019ascenseur du site Daly oblige les personnes qui ont de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 marcher \u00e0, par exemple, faire le tour de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. O\u00f9 donc est l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ou la logique dans tout ceci? Il y a peut\u2011\u00eatre un ascenseur au milieu du d\u00e9tour, mais le d\u00e9tour en lui\u2011m\u00eame constitue une injustice et ne constitue pas une forme raisonnable d\u2019accommodement.\n[260] Les marches de la rue York constituent un obstacle pour les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Il est \u00e9vident que les personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches ne jouissent pas du m\u00eame acc\u00e8s au parc Major que les autres personnes. La CCN n\u2019a pr\u00e9vu aucun accommodement raisonnable. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la CCN, en construisant et en entretenant les marches, a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Brown et des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience, et ce, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[261] M. Corush a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le projet de la rue York et de la promenade Sussex visait \u00e0 permettre aux personnes de gravir la colline. Les marches compl\u00e9t\u00e9es invitent les visiteurs et les r\u00e9sidents \u00e0 monter la colline et \u00e0 examiner le parc, le panorama qu\u2019il offre et l\u2019enceinte des \u00e9difices du Parlement. C\u2019est la CCN qui a invit\u00e9 le public \u00e0 venir profiter de ce lieu. En vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, elle doit \u00e9tendre cette invitation aux personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches.\n[262] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il est impossible de d\u00e9cider quelle forme d\u2019accommodement est ad\u00e9quate sans tenir un processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate et de consultation qui explore la question. Des questions d\u2019ing\u00e9nierie doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es. Des questions d\u2019ordre esth\u00e9tique, historique et s\u00e9curitaire se posent \u00e9galement. Il arrive un moment o\u00f9, \u00e0 tout le moins, les co\u00fbts doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s.\n[263] Les consultations qui ont eu lieu dans le pass\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisantes. Elles n\u2019ont pas permis d\u2019examiner convenablement le probl\u00e8me. Elles n\u2019ont pas donn\u00e9 au public ou \u00e0 la collectivit\u00e9 des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience une v\u00e9ritable occasion de contribuer au processus. Elles n\u2019ont pas fait preuve du niveau d\u2019engagement qui caract\u00e9rise un v\u00e9ritable processus de consultation. La partie qui a la responsabilit\u00e9 de trancher la question doit \u00eatre pr\u00eate \u00e0 changer ses opinions ou \u00e0 modifier sa mani\u00e8re d\u2019aborder le probl\u00e8me.\n[264] L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment important \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape tardive est qu\u2019il faut corriger la situation. Je crois, en outre, que la solution est relativement simple. La CCN doit retourner au processus d\u2019accommodement et poursuivre ses consultations. Les autres parties sont juridiquement tenues de participer sinc\u00e8rement et honn\u00eatement aux n\u00e9gociations. \u00c0 ce stade, \u00e0 tout le moins, il n\u2019appartient pas au Tribunal de d\u00e9cider ce que constituerait un accommodement raisonnable.\n[265] Ce point m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre soulign\u00e9. La CCN est toujours le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire du site. Elle jouit de tous les privil\u00e8ges exclusifs qui vont avec cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Au bout du compte, c\u2019est la CCN qui a la responsabilit\u00e9, voir m\u00eame le privil\u00e8ge de d\u00e9cider de l\u2019accommodement ad\u00e9quat. Cela ne diminue pas ses obligations. Le processus d\u2019accommodement doit \u00eatre un processus de collaboration.\nV. La responsabilit\u00e9 : les arguments avanc\u00e9s contre Travaux publics et services gouvernementaux [266] Je suis \u00e9galement convaincu que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, le fait que Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux n\u2019ait pas particip\u00e9 pleinement au processus visant \u00e0 accommoder M. Brown constitue un comportement discriminatoire. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une violation de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Travaux publics a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre de questions dans sa d\u00e9fense.\nA. Travaux publics n\u2019est pas \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 [267] La premi\u00e8re question est pr\u00e9liminaire et demande une explication. M. Rapson a affirm\u00e9 dans le t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il a rendu au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience que l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught, lequel appartient apparemment \u00e0 Travaux publics, constituait le moyen naturel de fournir l\u2019acc\u00e8s au site. Cela a amen\u00e9 la CCDP \u00e0 demander par requ\u00eate que Travaux publics soit constitu\u00e9 partie \u00e0 l\u2019instance. J\u2019ai accueilli cette requ\u00eate.\n[268] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, Travaux publics a maintenant adopt\u00e9 la position qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie au litige initial. Il pr\u00e9tend que cela emp\u00eache le Tribunal de tirer une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. M. Lester fait ensuite valoir que le plaignant et la CCDP ne peuvent exercer aucun recours contre Travaux publics sans qu\u2019une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e.\n[269] J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 trait\u00e9 du premier point en constituant Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada partie \u00e0 la plainte. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit clairement l\u2019adjonction de parties. Je soulignerais que l\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e et que Travaux publics a eu beaucoup de temps pour se renseigner sur les faits et les d\u00e9tails de la cause. Il ne peut plus se plaindre qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9s\u00e9 par le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie au litige initial.\n[270] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne met l\u2019accent sur le redressement. Si cela signifie qu\u2019il faut faire intervenir un organisme d\u2019\u00c9tat, dans les circonstances qui me sont soumises, je crois que la Loi m\u2019ordonne de le faire. Le but vis\u00e9 par l\u2019adjonction de Travaux publics comme cointim\u00e9 est de voir \u00e0 ce que toutes les solutions possibles au probl\u00e8me puissent \u00eatre ad\u00e9quatement examin\u00e9es. L\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught ne peut pas \u00eatre pris en compte comme lieu d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 moins que Travaux publics ne soit constitu\u00e9 partie \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[271] J\u2019accepte n\u00e9anmoins la pr\u00e9tention de Travaux publics quant au deuxi\u00e8me point. Je crois que M. Lester a bien interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, lequel n\u2019accorde au Tribunal que le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance contre la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire. Toutefois, cela ne fait que r\u00e9orienter l\u2019instruction et soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir si le fait de ne pas avoir aid\u00e9 la CCN et, en bout de ligne la CCDP, \u00e0 r\u00e9gler la plainte suffit pour fonder une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9. Je crois que oui.\n[272] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a eu aucun probl\u00e8me \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un syndicat dans Goyette c. Voyageur Colonial Lt\u00e9e, [1999] A.C.F. no 1678; 2000 CLLC 230-021, pour le motif que celui\u2011ci avait n\u00e9goci\u00e9 des ententes discriminatoires avec l\u2019employeur. Le juge Pinard a invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame dans Central Okanagan School District no 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, page 989, dans laquelle il fut mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019un syndicat qui est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019effet discriminatoire ou qui y contribue encourt une responsabilit\u00e9.\n[273] Je crois que la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Goyette refl\u00e8te le fait qu\u2019il y a des situations o\u00f9 il est impossible de traiter une plainte ad\u00e9quatement sans faire intervenir une tierce partie. Je ne voudrais pas aller trop loin. La solution de rechange n\u2019est toutefois pas satisfaisante. Je ne voudrais pas accepter comme principe qu\u2019il y a des cas o\u00f9 aucun accommodement ne peut \u00eatre fourni, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il soit facile d\u2019en fournir un gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des moyens externes aux parties. Travaux publics peut se consoler en raison du fait que ce \u00e0 quoi on peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre de la part d\u2019une tierce partie peut \u00eatre moins que ce \u00e0 quoi on peut s\u2019attendre du principal intim\u00e9.\n[274] Il y a deux possibilit\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019une est qu\u2019il existe un devoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de faciliter l\u2019accommodement. Le d\u00e9faut de s\u2019acquitter de ce devoir suffit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte contre une tierce partie. Selon cette interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, il est suffisant que Travaux publics ait refus\u00e9 de collaborer avec les autres parties afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer s\u2019il \u00e9tait r\u00e9alisable d\u2019utiliser l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. La responsabilit\u00e9 de Travaux publics se limite peut\u2011\u00eatre au d\u00e9faut de collaborer; il demeure n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019il est responsable.\n[275] Il n\u2019est toutefois pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019aller si loin en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019autre possibilit\u00e9 est qu\u2019il existe un lien suffisant entre Travaux publics et la CCN pour imposer une obligation sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 Travaux publics. Je reconnais que les deux organismes, si je peux utiliser cette expression, sont des entit\u00e9s juridiques distinctes. Elles sont n\u00e9anmoins toutes les deux des cr\u00e9ations de l\u2019\u00c9tat et servent l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[276] Il existe un principe en droit qui veut que la Couronne est indivisible. Je crois que l\u2019id\u00e9e derri\u00e8re ce principe est utile, du moins par analogie, dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le facteur d\u00e9terminant est que l\u2019\u00c9tat est dans un certain sens le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire des marches de la rue York et de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. L\u2019administration des deux parcelles de terrain se trouve peut\u2011\u00eatre dans des mains distinctes, mais le bien et l\u2019objet de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sont dans un certain sens la m\u00eame chose.\n[277] Les personnalit\u00e9s juridiques de la CCN et de Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux proviennent d\u2019une certaine mani\u00e8re de la m\u00eame source. Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je crois que le lien entre la CCN et le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics est suffisant pour que l\u2019on exige que le minist\u00e8re ait aid\u00e9 la CCN dans son enqu\u00eate relative au choix possible de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught comme lieu d\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur. Nous avons le choix entre donner effet aux droits fondamentaux de la personne ou permettre qu\u2019ils soient brim\u00e9s par la division technique de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[278] Il me semble que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la fourniture de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 est une obligation qui est li\u00e9e, d\u2019une certaine mani\u00e8re, au bien en question. L\u2019\u00c9tat est d\u2019une certaine mani\u00e8re le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire des marches de la rue York et de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught et c\u2019est l\u2019administration de ces deux biens\u2014je dois le dire, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2014qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je crois que cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 peut \u00eatre d\u00e9duite de la preuve malgr\u00e9 que le sujet n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 aussi longuement qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb l\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nB. Il est trop tard pour se plaindre d\u2019une irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dans le processus [279] Travaux publics pr\u00e9tend de plus qu\u2019il y a un d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle. Cet argument est fond\u00e9 sur le fait que la CCDP n\u2019a pas fourni les pr\u00e9cisions appropri\u00e9es.\n[280] Je ne vois aucun pr\u00e9judice en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les questions pos\u00e9es par l\u2019avocat de la CCDP tout au long de l\u2019audience \u00e9taient simples et directes. L\u2019all\u00e9gation est que Travaux publics a refus\u00e9 de participer aux efforts des autres parties afin de trouver un moyen de fournir un acc\u00e8s sur le lieu des marches. Les faits sont peu nombreux parce que Travaux publics a refus\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate tenue en vertu de la Loi.\n[281] L\u2019argument de Travaux publics est tardif. Le sujet aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9 beaucoup plus t\u00f4t. J\u2019estime que Travaux publics a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 tout droit de pr\u00e9senter des objections en choisissant de ne pas soulev\u00e9 la question avant la fin du processus alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait trop tard pour corriger la lacune. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, toute lacune a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9change de nombreuses observations de la part de l\u2019ensemble des parties.\n[282] Le seul aspect de ces observations faites par Travaux publics que j\u2019accepterais est que la CCDP est all\u00e9e trop loin lorsqu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9tendu que Travaux publics avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Brown en ne fournissant aucun acc\u00e8s par l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Selon la preuve et selon les pr\u00e9cisions, cela va trop loin et il est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 d\u2019affirmer si Travaux publics est tenu de permettre l\u2019utilisation de ses installations \u00e0 des fins d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9.\nC. Le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des arguments avanc\u00e9s contre Travaux publics [283] Je n\u2019accepte pas l\u2019observation de l\u2019avocat que Travaux publics a s\u00e9rieusement examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de permettre l\u2019acc\u00e8s public par le biais de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. La faute incombe compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 Travaux publics. La lettre \u00e9manant de M. Charette, le gestionnaire de l\u2019\u00e9difice, a essentiellement emp\u00each\u00e9 toute discussion de la question.\n[284] Travaux publics a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience en rapport avec ses inqui\u00e9tudes en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Cette preuve \u00e9tait toutefois nouvelle et les parties n\u2019ont pu y avoir acc\u00e8s que lorsque Travaux publics a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 partie \u00e0 la plainte. Le minist\u00e8re a n\u00e9anmoins adopt\u00e9 une position coh\u00e9rente. Il a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit dans ses observations \u00e9crites :\n[Traduction]\nLa principale pr\u00e9occupation de Travaux publics en ce qui concernait l\u2019acc\u00e8s par le biais de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught \u00e9tait que les probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9s ad\u00e9quatement.\nCette affirmation a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en \u00e9vidence par le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Matte.\n[285] Les observations donnent ensuite \u00e0 penser que les membres du public auraient d\u00fb se soumettre \u00e0 [Traduction] diverses mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, notamment \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019identification personnelle, au port d\u2019un laissez-passer et \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification des bagages. Il y aurait un risque pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 si les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada utilisaient le m\u00eame ascenseur que les membres du public. On a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en rapport avec un certain nombre de probl\u00e8mes architecturaux et physiques qui font en sorte que l\u2019on ne peut pas utiliser l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught.\n[286] Ces pr\u00e9occupations ainsi qu\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations doivent \u00eatre soupes\u00e9es et \u00e9valu\u00e9es lorsque l\u2019on d\u00e9cide s\u2019il conviendrait d\u2019utiliser l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught pour fournir l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux marches de la rue York. Le probl\u00e8me est que Travaux publics a trait\u00e9 ces probl\u00e8mes comme \u00e9tant un obstacle juridique \u00e0 toute discussion relative \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement. Je rejette cette position. On ne peut pas se soustraire aussi facilement au processus d\u2019accommodement envisag\u00e9 par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et la jurisprudence.\n[287] Le plaignant et la CCDP ont droit \u00e0 une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9. On a le sentiment, \u00e0 tout le moins, que cette conclusion est pr\u00e9liminaire. M. Lester et Mme Kikuchi ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit dans leurs observations :\n[Traduction]\n[...] avant que la solution de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught ne puisse \u00eatre examin\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit comme \u00e9tant un accommodement raisonnable ou une solution efficace, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019un processus de consultation avec les divers int\u00e9ress\u00e9s doit \u00eatre entrepris.\nLes parties doivent n\u00e9gocier davantage.\n[288] Je suis convaincu que, en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux est tenu par la loi de participer aux efforts de la CCN visant \u00e0 r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me dans son ensemble. Bien que je ne me prononce pas quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught devrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour fournir l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux marches de la rue York, cette possibilit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas \u00e9cart\u00e9e. Elle devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e ouvertement et correctement, sans conditions. Je vais laisser aux parties le soin de d\u00e9cider jusqu\u2019o\u00f9 cet examen devrait aller.\n[289] Je mettrai de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la question de savoir si la CCN peut \u00eatre tenue responsable, dans une certaine mesure, de ne pas avoir enqu\u00eat\u00e9 davantage. Je ne vois n\u00e9anmoins pas, compte tenu de la preuve qui m\u2019est soumise, comment la CCN pourrait s\u2019acquitter de son obligation l\u00e9gale d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement sans enqu\u00eater s\u00e9rieusement sur l\u2019utilisation possible de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Il me semble que la CCN et la CCDP auraient d\u00fb insister beaucoup plus \u00e9nergiquement pour que Travaux publics participe au processus d\u2019accommodement.\nVI. Les questions relatives au redressement [290] Il appert clairement de la jurisprudence que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de superviser la partie de ses audiences qui a trait au redressement. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une partie normale de son processus. Je garde donc comp\u00e9tence pour examiner les questions d\u00e9coulant de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision et de la question du redressement.\n[291] Si je comprends bien, M. Brown demande ce qui suit :\nune ordonnance portant que la CCN rende accessibles les marches actuelles de la rue York; des excuses \u00e9crites; une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral; une v\u00e9rification de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019ensemble des installations administr\u00e9es par la CCN; des s\u00e9ances de formation pour l\u2019ensemble du personnel de la CCN qui travaille sur les questions d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9.\n[292] La CCDP demande ce qui suit :\nune lettre d\u2019excuse adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Brown; des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats pour douleurs et souffrances; des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats pour les d\u00e9penses encourues; une ordonnance portant que le site soit adapt\u00e9 aux fauteuils roulants; une ordonnance portant que la CCN travaille de concert avec la CCDP \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une politique en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9.\n[293] Un certain nombre de questions sont soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Selon la d\u00e9cision Stevenson c. Canada (Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9), [2003] A.C.F. no 491, je ne peux pas ordonner que l\u2019on pr\u00e9sente des excuses. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je crois que la question de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour souffrances et douleurs devrait \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e rapidement. Je ne sais pas au juste si la CCDP parle au nom de M. Brown quant \u00e0 la question de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 et des d\u00e9penses.\n[294] Les parties doivent m\u2019informer par \u00e9crit quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle elles d\u00e9sirent proc\u00e9der. La demande de d\u00e9livrance d\u2019une ordonnance portant que la CCN rende accessibles les marches de la rue York est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, je crois qu\u2019il est suffisant de pr\u00e9parer une ordonnance formelle portant que la CCN retourne au processus de consultation, rel\u00e8ve les solutions de rechange possibles et propose une quelconque forme d\u2019accommodement raisonnable. Les autres parties auraient le droit de revenir devant le Tribunal afin d\u2019obtenir des directives si elles estiment que la CCN a refus\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les solutions de rechange raisonnables.\n[295] Ces consultations comportent un aspect politique. Le public doit \u00eatre invit\u00e9 \u00e0 participer aux consultations. Il est permis de penser que le Comit\u00e9 consultatif municipal, M. Brown et la CCDP devraient participer \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re au processus. D\u2019autres parties, des minist\u00e8res et des personnes pourraient \u00e9galement \u00eatre consult\u00e9s, que ce soit des personnes responsables de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans le secteur ou des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019ambassade am\u00e9ricaine. C\u2019est \u00e0 la CCN qu\u2019il appartient en bout de ligne de d\u00e9cider quelles personnes devraient \u00eatre invit\u00e9es \u00e0 participer au processus, sous r\u00e9serve des objections que pourraient formuler les autres parties.\n[296] Je dois faire une autre remarque. Il me semble que le processus de consultation ne peut \u00eatre engag\u00e9 qu\u2019en prenant pour acquis qu\u2019une forme quelconque d\u2019accommodement peut \u00eatre fournie sur le lieu des marches. La seule question consiste \u00e0 savoir quelle forme d\u2019accommodement est raisonnable. Si l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties a des probl\u00e8mes avec cette compr\u00e9hension de la situation, elles devraient demander au Tribunal de formuler des directives suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[297] Les parties sont tenues d\u2019agir de bonne foi. Elles sont tenues par la loi de tenter d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 un consensus dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable. Si des questions sont soulev\u00e9es quant au processus qui devrait \u00eatre suivi pour r\u00e9gler l\u2019affaire ou si les parties ont besoin qu\u2019on leur donne des directives sur une question pr\u00e9cise, elles peuvent s\u2019adresser au Tribunal pour que celui\u2011ci leur donne ces directives.\nVII. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des principales conclusions [298] L\u2019affaire est tellement complexe qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre utile de r\u00e9sumer les principales conclusions et les principales directives formul\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Elles sont les suivantes :\nLe bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la plainte contre la CCN a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Les marches de la rue York ne sont pas accessibles. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une violation de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que le fait de les rendre accessibles imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 la CCN. Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 au processus d\u2019accommodement. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une forme de comportement discriminatoire. Le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Travaux Publics a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Le lien qui existe entre la CCN et Travaux publics, lesquels sont tous les deux des cr\u00e9ations de l\u2019\u00c9tat, est suffisant pour que l\u2019on exige la participation de Travaux publics. L\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur sur le site Daly ne permet pas de satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019accommoder M. Brown ainsi que les autres personnes qui sont incapables de monter les marches. La CCN est tenue par la loi de fournir un accommodement dans le voisinage imm\u00e9diat des marches sans subir de contrainte excessive. Ce voisinage comprend le c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. L\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement comprend l\u2019obligation de participer \u00e0 un v\u00e9ritable dialogue avec la partie qui exige un accommodement. Il existe une obligation de faire des enqu\u00eates et de consulter les autres parties. La CCN \u00e9tait tenue d\u2019examiner la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. Travaux publics \u00e9tait tenu de collaborer \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Les deux intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas respect\u00e9 leurs obligations. Je suis convaincu que Travaux publics est seul responsable du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas collabor\u00e9 avec les autres parties afin de rendre les marches accessibles apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Cela m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 la situation actuelle. La CCN est tenue de rendre les marches de la rue York accessibles, jusqu\u2019au point mentionn\u00e9 dans la Loi. Ce faisant, la CCN est tenue de consulter M. Brown, la CCDP et la collectivit\u00e9 des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Le processus de consultation devrait \u00eatre transparent et s\u00e9rieux. Aucune d\u00e9cision ne devrait \u00eatre prise avant que la consultation n\u2019ait eu lieu. Travaux publics est tenu par la loi de participer au processus de consultation. M. Brown et les autres participants au processus de consultation sont tenus de participer d\u2019une mani\u00e8re sinc\u00e8re au processus, de faire part aux intim\u00e9s de leurs pr\u00e9occupations et d\u2019accepter une offre raisonnable d\u2019accommodement. Le mandat pr\u00e9vu par la loi de la CCN doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9. Tous les participants au processus de consultation doivent \u00eatre conscients des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes de la CCN en ce qui a trait aux cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019accommodement sur le plan symbolique, esth\u00e9tique, historique et financier. Selon moi, les facteurs mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne sont pas exhaustifs. Les consultations qui ont eu lieu en 1994 et en 1999 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9es et insuffisantes. Ce ne fut pas le genre de processus approfondi et d\u00e9taill\u00e9 que la loi exige. L\u2019exemple le plus \u00e9vident de ceci est le fait de ne pas avoir s\u00e9rieusement examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser le puits d\u2019ascenseur situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 nord de l\u2019\u00e9difice Connaught. D\u2019autres questions devraient \u00e9galement \u00eatre examin\u00e9es, comme le lieu pr\u00e9cis de l\u2019installation envisag\u00e9e d\u2019un ascenseur sur le lieu des marches. Je suis convaincu que la CCN croyait sinc\u00e8rement que l\u2019installation d\u2019un ascenseur au site Daly constituerait un accommodement raisonnable. Cela explique peut\u2011\u00eatre pourquoi la CCN n\u2019a pas entrepris en 1994 et 1999 le genre de discussion transparente et exploratoire que la loi exige. M. Brown, M. Warren et M. McMahon, lesquels sont tous incapables de monter les marches, ont estim\u00e9 que la CCN avait eu une attitude condescendante. Il est trop t\u00f4t pour faire des commentaires sur le genre d\u2019accommodement qui serait convenable. L\u2019expertise qui est exig\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d\u2019architecture, de planification, d\u2019acc\u00e8s et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 appartient aux parties, lesquelles devront retourner \u00e0 leurs discussions et d\u00e9cider quelle forme d\u2019accommodement est exig\u00e9e. Les parties doivent annexer un calendrier des consultations dans l\u2019ordonnance formelle. Je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que les intim\u00e9s ne sont tenus que de fournir un accommodement raisonnable. Il n\u2019est pas inutile de le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter. La norme est celle du caract\u00e8re raisonnable. Le renvoi \u00e0 l\u2019expression contrainte excessive qui figure dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne modifie pas cette norme. Il est \u00e9galement clair que la CCN n\u2019est pas tenue d\u2019accommoder le plaignant et les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience si l\u2019accommodement en question lui imposerait une contrainte excessive. Si le plaignant et la Commission estiment que les intim\u00e9s ne se sont pas acquitt\u00e9s de l\u2019obligation qui leur incombait de consulter ouvertement et sinc\u00e8rement les autres parties ou qu\u2019ils ont agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable, ils ont droit de s\u2019adresser \u00e0 nouveau au Tribunal. Toutes les parties ont le droit de demander l\u2019aide du Tribunal s\u2019il arrive que des questions soulev\u00e9es exigent que celui\u2011ci donne des directives. Les parties doivent donc retourner \u00e0 leurs n\u00e9gociations. D\u00e8s que ces n\u00e9gociations seront termin\u00e9es et que la CCN aura d\u00e9cid\u00e9 quel accommodement elle est dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir, elle doit envoyer aux autres parties une lettre d\u2019intention officielle, ou autre avis, quant \u00e0 la mesure envisag\u00e9e, dans laquelle elle expose ses plans visant \u00e0 corriger la situation. Ce document doit \u00eatre sign\u00e9 par le pr\u00e9sident de la CCN, le repr\u00e9sentant du pr\u00e9sident de la CCN ou un dirigeant de la CCN, ayant le pouvoir de lier la CCN. Les autres parties auront jusqu\u2019\u00e0 30 jours pour porter officiellement l\u2019affaire devant le Tribunal si elles estiment que ce processus ne r\u00e8glera pas la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Toutes les parties ont le droit de s\u2019adresser plus t\u00f4t au Tribunal si cela s\u2019av\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire. Les parties doivent informer le Tribunal dans les 30 jours suivants quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle elles aimeraient traiter la demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 et autres points non r\u00e9solus. Dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une ordonnance \u00e9crite devrait \u00eatre rendue. Je suis donc d\u2019avis d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 la CCDP de pr\u00e9parer une ordonnance officielle \u00e9non\u00e7ant les modalit\u00e9s selon lesquelles l\u2019affaire sera instruite. Si les parties ne peuvent pas s\u2019entendre sur les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019ordonnance, je leur ordonnerai d\u2019entrer en communication avec le Tribunal dans les 45 jours qui suivront la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[299] La pr\u00e9sente instance fut difficile et je voudrais remercier les avocats pour l\u2019aide pr\u00e9cieuse qu\u2019ils ont apport\u00e9e. J\u2019attends des nouvelles des parties.\n[300] J\u2019ai le regret de vous informer que Geoffrey Lester, avocat principal de Travaux publics, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 subitement avant de pouvoir pr\u00e9senter ses observations finales. Je suis persuad\u00e9 que les avocats et les parties aimeraient que je souligne le travail qu\u2019il a fait dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance. M. Lester \u00e9tait un plaideur passionn\u00e9 et il a gagn\u00e9 le respect de tous \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Je crois que sa force, sa franchise et sa rigueur intellectuelle manqueront \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDr Paul Groarke Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 6 juin 2006\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T760\/1003\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nBob Brown c.la Commission de la capitale nationale et Travaux publics et Services gouvernement aux Canada\nDate de la d\u00e9cision du tribunal : Le 6 juin 2006\nDate et lieu de l\u2019audience :\nLes 18 au 21 mai 2004 Les 23, 24, 29 et 30 juin 2004\nOttawa (Ontario)\nComparutions :\nBob Brown, pour lui m\u00eame\nPhilippe Dufresne \/ Giacomo Vigna \/, pour la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne Ikram Warsame\nLynn H.

Grant Sinclair\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Esper Powell, la plaignante dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte dat\u00e9e du 16 janvier 2002 dans laquelle elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e, United Parcel Service Canada Ltd., avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, et ce, en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La plaignante pr\u00e9tend que des actes de discrimination ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis en 1990, 1991, 1992, 1996 et 2001.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e, par requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 3 janvier 2005 (affidavit \u00e0 l'appui dat\u00e9 du 31 mars 2006), a demand\u00e9 au paragraphe a) de cette requ\u00eate que le Tribunal ordonne que la seule all\u00e9gation de discrimination renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction en rapport avec la plainte est celle qui a trait au pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 incident qui se serait produit le 20 juillet 2001.\n[3] La Commission a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 deux rapports d'enqu\u00eate, l'un dat\u00e9 du 21 mai 2003 et l'autre dat\u00e9 du 18 f\u00e9vrier 2004. Dans le rapport d'enqu\u00eate du 21 mai 2003, on concluait que les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de discrimination survenus en 1990, 1991, 1992 et 1996 \u00e9taient prescrits. Le rapport recommandait que la Commission n'enqu\u00eate que l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination du 20 juillet 2001.\n[4] C'est ce que la Commission a fait et le rapport d'enqu\u00eate du 18 f\u00e9vrier 2004 est le produit qui a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de cette enqu\u00eate. Ce rapport mettait l'accent sur l'incident survenu le 20 juillet 2001 et recommandait que, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de r\u00e8glement, la plainte soit renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission le 19 ao\u00fbt 2004.\n[5] Il est clair que l'incident de discrimination sur lequel la Commission a fait enqu\u00eate et dont elle a saisi le Tribunal pour que celui-ci l'instruise \u00e9tait celui qui s'est produit le 20 juillet 2001.\n[6] La plaignante souscrit \u00e0 l'affirmation qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de. Dans une t\u00e9l\u00e9copie dat\u00e9e du 15 juin 2005, l'avocat de la plaignante a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [Traduction] [...] J'ai rencontr\u00e9 Mme Powell en rapport avec les documents de votre requ\u00eate. Elle m'a donn\u00e9 instruction de convenir que la seule plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour d\u00e9cision est celle qui a trait \u00e0 l'incident du 20 juillet 2001. Toutefois, elle ne me donne pas instruction de convenir que UPS n'a pas \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations d'incidents qui seraient produits avant le 20 juillet 2001.\n[7] Cette question a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence tenue le 15 janvier 2005 entre le Tribunal et les avocats des deux parties. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, les deux avocats ont convenu qu'[Traduction] une ordonnance confirmant que la seule plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction et d\u00e9cision en rapport avec la demanderesse Esper Powell a trait \u00e0 l'incident du 20 juillet 2001, et rien d'autre.\n[8] Par ailleurs, dans la t\u00e9l\u00e9copie envoy\u00e9e par l'avocat de la plaignante le 10 mai 2006 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, celui-ci a fait part que la plaignante avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une nouvelle plainte contre l'intim\u00e9e dans laquelle elle all\u00e9guait avoir fait l'objet d'autres actes discriminatoires. L'avocat a demand\u00e9 que cette plainte soit trait\u00e9e conjointement avec la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante le 16 janvier 2002.\n[9] Le Tribunal ne peut se pencher que sur des plaintes qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es par la Commission. La Commission n'a renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal que la plainte du 16 janvier 2002. Le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour ordonner la r\u00e9union d'une autre plainte qui a pu \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission avec une plainte dont il est d\u00e9j\u00e0 saisi.\nORDONNANCE\nLe Tribunal ordonne que la seule all\u00e9gation de discrimination dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 16 janvier 2002 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction est celle qui a trait au pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 incident du 20 juillet 2001; Le Tribunal ordonne de plus que chaque partie fournisse, au plus tard le 30 juin 2006, des dates, en novembre 2006, d\u00e9cembre 2006 ou janvier 2007 pour l'audition de la plainte.

Marc Lemire, un t\u00e9moin \u00e9ventuel repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l'avocate Barbara Kulaszka, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate par laquelle il demandait au Tribunal d'annuler l'assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, d\u00e9livr\u00e9e le 6 juin 2006, qui exigeait qu'il se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'audience et rende un t\u00e9moignage. L'assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner exigeait de plus que M. Lemire produise [traduction] tous les renseignements en sa possession se rapportant \u00e0 l'utilisation des pseudonymes rump et realcanadianson sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique du Freedomsite. L'information demand\u00e9e doit inclure, sans s'y limiter, tous les renseignements r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par M. Lemire au paragraphe 5 d'une demande faite par le plaignant pour la d\u00e9livrance de l'assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner de Marc Lemire et jointe aux pr\u00e9sentes.\n[2] Mme Kulaszka a contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9livrance de l'assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner au motif qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas indispensable \u00e0 l'examen complet de la plainte par le Tribunal, au motif que M. Lemire n'avait aucune preuve substantielle \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal, autre que celle dont le Tribunal \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 saisi, et au motif que l'assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e9tait un abus de proc\u00e9dure de la part du plaignant.\n[3] Le pouvoir du Tribunal de d\u00e9livrer une assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner se trouve \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne qui pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n50(3) Pour la tenue de ses audiences, le membre instructeur a le pouvoir :\na) d'assigner et de contraindre les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, \u00e0 d\u00e9poser verbalement ou par \u00e9crit sous la foi du serment et \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces qu'il juge indispensables \u00e0 l'examen complet de la plainte, au m\u00eame titre qu'une cour sup\u00e9rieure d'archives;\n[4] La d\u00e9livrance d'une assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner par le Tribunal n'est pas un acte administratif. Le Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9livrer ou non une assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Suivant l'alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la Loi, le membre instructeur a le pouvoir de d\u00e9livrer une assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner s'il le juge indispensable \u00e0 l'examen complet de la plainte (ACET c. Bell Canada, T503\/2098, d\u00e9cision no 2). L'exigence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'est pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e. D'abord, il doit y avoir un lien rationnel entre la preuve que le t\u00e9moin \u00e9ventuel pr\u00e9sentera et les questions en litige dont le Tribunal est saisi. La demande ne doit pas \u00eatre conjecturale ni \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 un interrogatoire \u00e0 l'aveuglette. Finalement, la demande ne devrait pas \u00eatre abusive.\n[5] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant, le membre instructeur du Tribunal, Karen Jensen, a jug\u00e9 que la preuve de M. Lemire \u00e9tait indispensable \u00e0 l'examen complet de la plainte et elle a accept\u00e9 de d\u00e9livrer une assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Je ne vois aucune raison d'annuler la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, j'estime que la preuve qui doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Lemire, selon ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9 dans la demande du plaignant en vue d'obtenir une assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, est pertinente quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente audience. Le plaignant a \u00e9tabli qu'il existe un lien entre la preuve qui doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le t\u00e9moin et les questions en litige en cause.\n[6] L'avocate de M. Lemire ne m'a pas convaincu que la preuve de son client n'est pas indispensable et elle ne m'a pas non plus convaincu que la d\u00e9livrance de l'assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e9tait un abus de proc\u00e9dure. La question de savoir si la preuve est pertinente ou substantielle est une question que je devrai trancher.\n[7] M. Warman, au cours de sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Mme Kulaszka, a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il serait satisfait si M. Lemire acceptait de fournir une preuve par affidavit. Mme Susen Holmes, repr\u00e9sentante de l'intim\u00e9, ne s'est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 cette proc\u00e9dure. M\u00eame si je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 ordonner que la preuve de M. Lemire soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au moyen d'un affidavit, j'incite fortement les parties \u00e0 examiner cette possibilit\u00e9. Le plaignant et la Commission pourraient transmettre \u00e0 Mme Kulaszka, au plus tard \u00e0 16 h le mardi 13 juin 2006, une s\u00e9rie de questions, et les r\u00e9ponses pourraient \u00eatre fournies par affidavit, avant la m\u00eame heure le mercredi 14 juin 2006, et \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve le jeudi matin, 15 juin 2006.\n[8] Pour le moment, la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Kulaszka en vue d'obtenir l'annulation de l'assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Lemire est rejet\u00e9e. M. Lemire devra se pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal \u00e0 la date et \u00e0 l'heure qui seront indiqu\u00e9es au d\u00e9but de l'audience le mardi matin et communiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 son avocate, \u00e0 moins que les parties soient pr\u00eates \u00e0 s'entendre sur une autre proc\u00e9dure.\nMichel Doucet\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 13 juin 2006\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1072\/5305\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nRichard Warman c.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur deux requ\u00eates. La premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en vue de modifier le nom de l'intim\u00e9 www.bcwhitepride.com pour qu'il soit BC White Pride Group associ\u00e9 au site Web www.bcwhitepride.com et d'ajouter deux autres intim\u00e9s, M. John Beck et le White Renegade Group. La deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate est une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Beck en vue de faire rejeter, sans qu'une audience soit tenue, la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre www.bcwhitepride.com. M. Beck n'est pas nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 dans la plainte, mais la Commission l'a identifi\u00e9 comme la personne \u00e0 qui le Tribunal devrait envoyer la correspondance destin\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[2] Dans sa requ\u00eate, M. Beck soutient que www.bcwhitepride.com n'est pas une personne ou un groupe de personnes au sens du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il soutient que la plainte devrait par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sans qu'une audience soit tenue. Le plaignant, le Centre de recherche-action sur les relations raciales, n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des requ\u00eates.\n[3] Pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'ajourner l'audition des requ\u00eates; le droit des parties de pr\u00e9senter ces requ\u00eates de nouveau, \u00e0 tout moment au cours de l'audience, n'est pas compromis ou touch\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on.\n[4] Premi\u00e8rement, le fait que le nom de l'intim\u00e9 comporte l'extension de fichier .com ne constitue pas, en soi, un motif de rejet automatique de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l'intim\u00e9. Plut\u00f4t, il faut se demander s'il existe quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant que www.bcwhitepride.com est le nom que porte une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord. Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kulbashian, 2006 TCDP 11, le Tribunal a conclu, en se fondant sur la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au cours de l'audience, que malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'il y ait dans son nom l'extension de fichier .com, l'intim\u00e9e Affordable Space.com \u00e9tait une personne au sens du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. Il existait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'Affordable Space.com \u00e9tait une entreprise qui fournissait des services Internet qui permettaient la communication sur Internet des messages en cause dans cette affaire. Par contre, dans la m\u00eame affaire, le Tribunal a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant que l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous le nom www.tricityskins.com \u00e9tait autre chose qu'un nom de site Web. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte contre www.tricityskins.com a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\n[5] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il y a des faits et des points contradictoires qui requi\u00e8rent un examen plus approfondi avant qu'une d\u00e9cision puisse \u00eatre rendue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la nature de l'intim\u00e9 www.bcwhitepride.com. La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 l'affidavit de M. Shane Martinez au soutien de sa position quant aux requ\u00eates. Dans son affidavit, M. Martinez d\u00e9clare qu'une partie de son travail dans le domaine des droits de la personne et des activit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de justice sociale consiste \u00e0 assurer une surveillance sur Internet. Dans le cadre de sa surveillance, M. Martinez a d\u00e9couvert les sites www.bcwhitepride.com et www.whiterenegade.com. M. Martinez a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il a directement pris contact avec M. Beck \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des sites Web. En se fondant sur les communications qu'il a eues, M. Martinez affirme que le groupe BC White Pride est un groupe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cofond\u00e9 par M. John Beck et que M. Beck a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une grande partie du contenu du site Web du groupe www.bcwhitepride.com.\n[6] On a pr\u00e9tendu, au nom de M. Beck, que l'affidavit de M. Martinez d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve est largement discutable et qu'il n'\u00e9tablit pas qu'il y a une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord qui porte le nom de BC White Pride Group ou www.bcwhitepride.com. M. Beck n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'affidavit et, jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant, il n'y a pas eu de contre-interrogatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'affidavit de M. Martinez.\n[7] \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve dont le Tribunal est saisi \u00e0 ce moment-ci est insuffisante pour r\u00e9gler les questions de fait et de droit permettant d'\u00e9tablir si l'intim\u00e9 www.bcwhitepride.com est une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord au sens du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi.\n[8] Le deuxi\u00e8me motif d'ajournement des pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates jusqu'\u00e0 l'audience se rapporte aux pr\u00e9occupations du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du fait de rejeter une plainte sans qu'une audience soit tenue. Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit qu'apr\u00e8s qu'un avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 aux parties en cause, le membre instructeur instruit la plainte et donne aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. En fait, le Tribunal n'a rejet\u00e9 des plaintes sans qu'une audience soit tenue que dans tr\u00e8s peu d'affaires et alors seulement sur le fondement de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ou de celle de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure (Cremasco c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2002-09-30 - d\u00e9cision no 1, confirm\u00e9e par 2004 CAF 363; Toth c. Kitchener Aero Avionics, 2005 TCDP 19; O'Connor c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux, 2006 TCDP 05). Dans ces affaires, le Tribunal a conclu que les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte avaient fait l'objet d'une d\u00e9cision judiciaire d\u00e9finitive devant une autre instance. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que toutes les parties en cause avaient eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de soulever devant une autre instance les questions en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce n'est que dans les circonstances les plus explicites qu'une plainte peut \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sur le fondement de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ou de celle de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure sans qu'une audience soit tenue (Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 106).\n[9] Tel n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Aucune d\u00e9cision n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. En fait, les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire sont plus semblables \u00e0 celles de l'affaire Bozek c. MCL Ryder, [2002] D.C.D.P. no 34, dans laquelle l'intim\u00e9e tentait d'obtenir le rejet de la plainte, compte tenu du temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 et du pr\u00e9judice en r\u00e9sultant, sans qu'une audience soit tenue. Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 qu'il y avait des faits et des points en litige qui requ\u00e9raient un dossier complet de preuve avant qu'une d\u00e9cision puisse \u00eatre rendue quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e compte tenu du temps \u00e9coul\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 que les auditions des requ\u00eates seraient ajourn\u00e9es jusqu'\u00e0 l'audition de la plainte.\n[10] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, il y a dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire des faits et des points en litige qui requi\u00e8rent un examen plus approfondi. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'affirmation de M. Beck selon laquelle il n'y a pas d'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve donnant \u00e0 penser que www.bcwhitepride.com est une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, la Commission soutient que le fait de rejeter la plainte, sans qu'une audience soit tenue, sur le fondement de l'objection d'ordre formaliste selon laquelle l'intim\u00e9 peut ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 va \u00e0 l'encontre de l'objet de la Loi. Tout ce qui peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire c'est de remplacer le nom de l'intim\u00e9 www.bcwhitepride.com par celui de BC White Pride Group associ\u00e9 au site Web www.bcwhitepride.com. Toutefois, la question de savoir si le Tribunal a le pouvoir de faire une substitution de cette nature n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue. De plus, les parties ne s'entendent pas quant \u00e0 la question de savoir s'il existe un fondement probatoire pour qu'une telle modification soit effectu\u00e9e.\n[11] Selon les circonstances de l'affaire, je ne vois pas de quelle fa\u00e7on le Tribunal peut \u00e0 ce moment-ci statuer sur la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 en vue de faire rejeter la plainte. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, je ne vois pas de quelle fa\u00e7on le Tribunal peut \u00e0 ce moment-ci d\u00e9cider si le nom BC White Pride Group associ\u00e9 au site Web www.bcwhitepride.com peut remplacer le nom actuel de l'intim\u00e9.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le 27 mai 2002, Mary Mellon (la plaignante) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) contre D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines Canada (l'intim\u00e9). Dans sa plainte, elle a pr\u00e9tendu que l'intim\u00e9 a commis, en cours d'emploi, un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur une d\u00e9ficience.\n[2] La plaignante pr\u00e9tend qu'elle souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, de crises d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de panique. Elle affirme de plus qu'une s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements li\u00e9s \u00e0 ces crises se sont produits dans son milieu de travail entre le 17 avril et le 30 ao\u00fbt 2001 et que ceux-ci ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 des conditions qui ont amen\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas renouveler son contrat d'emploi.\n[3] Durant l'audience, les parties ont demand\u00e9 que la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 ainsi que celle des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats et des r\u00e9parations, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, soient trait\u00e9es s\u00e9par\u00e9ment. J'ai accueilli la demande de disjonction de l'audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision ne portera que sur la question de la responsabilit\u00e9. Comme j'ai conclu que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, la tenue d'une autre audience sera ordonn\u00e9e afin de traiter des questions de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats et de r\u00e9paration.\nII. L'HISTORIQUE DE L'EMPLOI DE LA PLAIGNANTE CHEZ L'INTIM\u00c9 [4] La plaignante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l'intim\u00e9 le 25 novembre 1991 \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9e embauch\u00e9e pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Elle a occup\u00e9 le poste de CR-03, R\u00e9ception et renseignements au bureau d'Hamilton de l'intim\u00e9. Cet emploi devait prendre fin le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1991, mais trois prorogations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es. L'emploi a finalement pris fin le 1er mai 1992.\n[5] Le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1992, elle s'est vu accorder une autre nomination pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, et ce, pour le m\u00eame poste et le m\u00eame niveau de classification. Cet emploi a pris fin le 31 mars 1993. Une nouvelle nomination pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, pour le m\u00eame poste et le m\u00eame niveau de classification, a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1993, et deux prorogations suppl\u00e9mentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es, une le 30 d\u00e9cembre 1993, et l'autre le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1994. Cette p\u00e9riode d'emploi a pris fin le 23 mars 1994.\n[6] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle aimait faire le travail exig\u00e9 par ce poste. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le milieu de travail \u00e9tait agr\u00e9able. Dans une lettre de recommandation, dat\u00e9e du 7 d\u00e9cembre 1993, le superviseur des Services d'emploi de l'intim\u00e9 a mentionn\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e qui [Traduction] [accomplissait] son travail avec diligence et efficacit\u00e9 et \u00e9tait une personne agr\u00e9able avec laquelle il [\u00e9tait] facile de travailler.\n[7] Le 28 juillet 1994, la plaignante s'est vu offrir une autre nomination pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, cette fois au bureau de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 Burlington. Il s'agissait une fois de plus d'un poste de CR-03. Deux autres prorogations de la dur\u00e9e de l'emploi quant \u00e0 ce poste ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offertes \u00e0 la plaignante, une le 6 octobre 1994 et l'autre le 29 d\u00e9cembre 1994. La derni\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d'emploi a pris fin le 22 mars 1995.\n[8] Le 24 f\u00e9vrier 1995, le superviseur de la plaignante au bureau de Burlington, M. Rick Levert, a \u00e9crit que la plaignante [Traduction] s'[\u00e9tait] r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e \u00eatre une travailleuse des plus fiables. Il a de plus ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Elle s'est bien adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la routine de notre bureau et elle est devenue un membre pr\u00e9cieux de notre personnel durant la br\u00e8ve p\u00e9riode de temps pendant laquelle elle a travaill\u00e9 ici. Ses mani\u00e8res agr\u00e9ables et sa gentillesse lui ont permis de gagner rapidement le respect des autres membres du personnel et sa complaisance envers les autres a exerc\u00e9 une influence positive sur notre bureau.\n[9] \u00c0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1997, Mme Marg Garey, la directrice du bureau de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 Oakville, a communiqu\u00e9 avec la plaignante. Celles-ci s'\u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 rencontr\u00e9es en 1991 alors que la plaignante travaillait au bureau d'Hamilton. Mme Garey a offert \u00e0 la plaignante un emploi d'une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au bureau de Oakville. La plaignante a accept\u00e9 et, du 7 juillet 1997 au 25 septembre 1997, elle a occup\u00e9 un poste de CR-04 comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le. La diff\u00e9rence entre un poste de niveau CR-03 et un poste de niveau CR-04 est qu'un poste de niveau CR-04 comporte plus de responsabilit\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cision et comporte l'ex\u00e9cution d'un plus grand nombre de t\u00e2ches.\n[10] Selon la plaignante, ce poste \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s exigeant. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que bien qu'elle aimait son travail, celui-ci est devenu, \u00e0 un certain moment, trop dur pour elle et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 nuire \u00e0 sa sant\u00e9. Le 29 octobre 1997, elle est all\u00e9e consulter la Dre Charanjeat Mander, laquelle rempla\u00e7ait sa m\u00e9decin de famille habituelle. \u00c9ventuellement, la Dre Mander est devenu la m\u00e9decin de famille de la plaignante. La Dre Mander a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prescrire un cong\u00e9 de trois semaines \u00e0 la plaignante. Elle lui a \u00e9galement prescrit du Paxil, un antid\u00e9presseur. La plaignante a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie entre le 17 octobre et le 14 novembre 1997. La note suivante figurait dans son dossier [Traduction] : stress \u00e9motionnel occasionn\u00e9 par le travail\/incapable de travailler jusqu'\u00e0 nouvel ordre.\n[11] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait inform\u00e9 sa directrice quant \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Elle a fait mention d'une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu'elles ont eue vers la p\u00e9riode susmentionn\u00e9e. Selon ce que la plaignante avait compris de cette conversation, Marg Garey comprenait sa situation. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait inform\u00e9 sa directrice qu'elle prenait des antid\u00e9presseurs et que ceux-ci avaient des effets tr\u00e8s n\u00e9fastes sur elle. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait mentionn\u00e9 que, dans ces circonstances, elle ne pouvait pas retourner \u00e0 son travail. Marg Garey a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvenait pas de cette conversation.\n[12] La plaignante est retourn\u00e9e au travail le 17 novembre 1997. Le 2 f\u00e9vrier 1998, Mme Garey a offert \u00e0 la plaignante une mutation \u00e0 un poste de niveau plus bas, c'est-\u00e0-dire un poste de niveau CR-03 (commis de soutien aux programmes). La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle a accept\u00e9 cette mutation \u00e0 un poste de niveau plus bas parce cela lui permettrait d'\u00e9voluer dans un environnement plus stable.\n[13] La plaignante a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e, le 11 mai 2000, pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, au bureau d'Oakville, au niveau CR-03, \u00e0 titre de commis \u00e0 la prestation des services. Ce poste CR-03 est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant son poste d'attache. Cette nomination a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e, sans interruption d'emploi, le 7 juillet 2000, le 22 septembre 2000 et le 30 mars 2001. En date du 9 juillet 2001, elle travaillait toujours dans le cadre de cette nomination, mais elle occupait un poste de niveau CR-4, \u00e0 titre d'adjointe \u00e0 la prestation des services.\n[14] Le milieu de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant autog\u00e9r\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire que les employ\u00e9s devaient eux-m\u00eames r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes qui pouvaient se pr\u00e9senter dans leur \u00e9quipe. Ainsi, lorsqu'une personne travaillant au service \u00e9tait absente, les autres employ\u00e9s de l'unit\u00e9 devaient travailler de concert \u00e0 combler cette absence.\n[15] Selon l'organigramme dat\u00e9 du 9 juillet 2001, le bureau d'Oakville disposait de 7 adjoints \u00e0 la prestation des services au niveau CR-04 et de l'\u00e9quivalent de 13,5 agents de programme. Durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9, on comptait quatre agents de programme suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison du programme de placement carri\u00e8re-\u00e9t\u00e9. Ces quatre agents suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s temporaires et quittaient avant l'automne.\nIII. LES \u00c9V\u00c8NEMENTS QUI SE SONT D\u00c9ROUL\u00c9S ENTRE AVRIL ET AO\u00dbT 2001 [16] Mme Debby McIntyre a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e directrice de la prestation des services au bureau d'Oakville le 17 avril 2001, et ce, en remplacement de Marg Garey. Mme McIntyre a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Rick Levert, le coordonnateur de la prestation des services, de superviser, en plus des services au comptoir, l'unit\u00e9 des travailleurs \u00e9trangers ainsi que l'unit\u00e9 de l'information sur le march\u00e9 du travail.\n[17] M. Levert a d\u00e9crit cette p\u00e9riode comme \u00e9tant une p\u00e9riode de transition. Il a ajout\u00e9 que l'une des modifications envisag\u00e9es \u00e9tait de faire en sorte que la plaignante devienne progressivement la personne de soutien \u00e0 la prestation des services de l'unit\u00e9 des travailleurs \u00e9trangers. Il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'un changement pour l'unit\u00e9 ainsi que pour la plaignante \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'unit\u00e9 n'avait jusque l\u00e0 jamais b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 des services exclusifs d'une personne de soutien. Avant cette p\u00e9riode, la plaignante et Diann Luksa s'occupaient des fonctions de soutien \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9. Debby McIntyre, Dal Swackhammer, le superviseur de l'unit\u00e9 du Programme, et M. Levert sont les personnes qui ont pris la d\u00e9cision d'apporter ces changements. M. Levert ne s'est pas souvenu avoir eu un quelconque entretien avec la plaignante \u00e0 propos de ces changements.\n[18] Debby McIntyre a conserv\u00e9 des notes quant aux diverses rencontres qu'elle a eues avec la plaignante et d'autres employ\u00e9s. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait pour habitude de prendre des notes en rapport avec les rencontres qu'elle avait avec les employ\u00e9s. Elle r\u00e9digeait ses notes imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la tenue de ces rencontres. Celles-ci ont beaucoup aid\u00e9 \u00e0 la reconstitution des \u00e9v\u00e8nements de la p\u00e9riode pertinente car les souvenirs qu'en avaient les divers t\u00e9moins se sont estomp\u00e9s avec le temps.\n[19] Mme McIntyre a admis que, avant le 17 avril 2001, elle n'\u00e9tait pas au courant que la plaignante avait des probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 faire son travail. Elle a \u00e9galement admis que le sujet du rendement de la plaignante au travail n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 dans les discussions qu'elle a eues avec Marg Garey lorsqu'elle est entr\u00e9e en fonction au bureau d'Oakville.\n[20] La plaignante a rencontr\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois son nouveau superviseur le 21 juin 2001. Selon les notes de Debby McIntyre, c'est la plaignante qui a demand\u00e9 la tenue de cette rencontre. Ses notes faisaient de plus mention que la plaignante lui avait affirm\u00e9, au cours de cette rencontre, qu'elle \u00e9tait de nouveau en proie \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes dans la r\u00e9gion du cou, ce qui lui occasionnait du stress et de l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. La plaignante a admis qu'elle s'\u00e9tait fait enlever une tumeur dans la r\u00e9gion du cou en mars 2000.\n[21] Debby McIntyre a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 que la plaignante lui a dit qu'elle avait consult\u00e9 sa m\u00e9decin mais qu'elle ne lui avait pas fait part de l'ensemble de son \u00e9tat car elle craignait que celle-ci lui conseille d'arr\u00eater de travailler. Mme McIntyre a ajout\u00e9 que la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas remis tous ses billets m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 Marg Garey, son ancienne directrice, car, lorsqu'elle avait eu des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9, elle avait ignor\u00e9 le conseil que lui avait donn\u00e9 sa m\u00e9decin de prendre un cong\u00e9 de maladie. La plaignante a ni\u00e9 avoir fait cette d\u00e9claration et a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle n'a jamais omis de tenir compte d'un billet m\u00e9dical r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par sa m\u00e9decin. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait vrai qu'elle h\u00e9sitait \u00e0 prendre des m\u00e9dicaments parce qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu une r\u00e9action n\u00e9gative par le pass\u00e9 alors qu'elle avait pris des m\u00e9dicaments.\n[22] Le 25 juin 2001, Mme McIntyre a rencontr\u00e9 Monica Kington et Esther Davis, deux agentes \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 des travailleurs \u00e9trangers. Dans ses notes, elle d\u00e9clare que celles-ci sont venues la voir dans son bureau pour lui dire qu'elles avaient des inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet de la plaignante. Elle a not\u00e9 que celles-ci ont soulign\u00e9 que bien que la plaignante se trouvait \u00e0 son poste de travail, elle laissait son travail s'accumuler et ne le faisait pas.\n[23] Le 27 juin 2001, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 assister \u00e0 une rencontre avec Monica Kington, Esther Davis et Pat Richard, toutes des agentes \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 des travailleurs \u00e9trangers. L'objet de cette rencontre \u00e9tait de discuter comment on pourrait venir \u00e0 bout de la charge de travail suppl\u00e9mentaire qui \u00e9tait apparue \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 suite \u00e0 l'absence de Diann Luksa, laquelle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie. Mme Luksa s'est absent\u00e9e du travail du 18 juin au 13 juillet 2001. Lors de la rencontre, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante si elle pourrait s'occuper du travail suppl\u00e9mentaire. Celle-ci a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait tent\u00e9 de discuter de sa sant\u00e9 mais que Monica Kington avait r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 qu'[Traduction] elles n'avaient pas \u00e0 discuter de cela. Monica Kington a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvenait pas de cet \u00e9change. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle se souvenait que la plaignante \u00e9tait devenue perturb\u00e9e lors de cette rencontre et qu'elle avait mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle d\u00e9sirait parler \u00e0 son superviseur. Pat Richard a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle ne ferait pas le travail. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 que, \u00e0 la fin de la rencontre, elle a accept\u00e9 de s'occuper du travail suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n[24] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, \u00e0 la suite de cette rencontre, elle a eu l'impression que ses compagnes de travail croyaient qu'elle ne voulait pas faire son travail. Elle a eu l'impression que, pour cette raison, les relations qu'elle entretenait avec celles-ci \u00e9taient en train de se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer.\n[25] Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la rencontre, les agentes sont all\u00e9es voir Mme McIntyre pour lui faire part de leurs impressions. Mme McIntyre a soulign\u00e9 que celles-ci avaient eu l'impression que la plaignante ne voulait pas participer \u00e0 la rencontre et elles ont mentionn\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait devenue agit\u00e9e et perturb\u00e9e. Mme McIntyre a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que la plaignante avait soulev\u00e9 la question de sa sant\u00e9 lors de la rencontre. Lors de son contre-interrogatoire, Mme Kington a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas fait part de ce renseignement \u00e0 Mme McIntyre. Pat Richard ne s'est souvenue d'aucune discussion concernant la sant\u00e9 de la plaignante lors de la rencontre. Comme Esther Davis n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9, je dois soit accepter que c'est elle qui a dit \u00e0 Mme McIntyre que l'on avait discut\u00e9 de cette question lors de la rencontre, soit accepter que Mme Kington et Mme Richard ne se sont pas bien souvenues de ce qui s'\u00e9tait dit lors de la rencontre. Mme McIntyre n'a certainement pas invent\u00e9 cela et je conclus que la question de la sant\u00e9 de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e lors de la rencontre et a \u00e9t\u00e9 par la suite discut\u00e9e avec Mme McIntyre.\n[26] Mme McIntyre a ajout\u00e9 que le fait que la plaignante soit devenue perturb\u00e9e n'a pas aid\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver une solution quant \u00e0 savoir comment le travail serait fait. Elle a de plus soulign\u00e9 que les agentes avaient mentionn\u00e9 que la plaignante semblait aimer s'occuper du travail moins prioritaire, comme l'envoi \u00e0 la poste de trousses de renseignements et la dactylographie de lettres, plut\u00f4t que la saisie de donn\u00e9es. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 que, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle tentait surtout de savoir ce dont on avait besoin sur le plan op\u00e9rationnel pour que le travail soit fait et qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas intervenue directement.\n[27] Pat Richard a \u00e9galement rencontr\u00e9 Rick Levert pour l'informer quant \u00e0 ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 au cours de la rencontre. En contre-interrogatoire, M. Levert a affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne savait pas que c'est au cours de cette rencontre que la plaignante a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e qu'elle devait s'occuper de toutes les t\u00e2ches de l'unit\u00e9 des travailleurs \u00e9trangers. Il a ajout\u00e9 que bien qu'il ne se souvienne pas du moment, la plaignante a d\u00fb \u00eatre inform\u00e9e de ces changements avant la rencontre, probablement de fa\u00e7on officieuse cependant. Toutefois, il a convenu qu'il \u00e9tait possible que cette question ait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois lors de cette rencontre.\n[28] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la charge de travail suppl\u00e9mentaire a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir un effet sur sa sant\u00e9. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, \u00e0 la fin de juin 2001, elle a souffert de crises d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s tendue. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle ne poss\u00e9dait pas les comp\u00e9tences pour faire le travail de Mme Luksa, bien qu'elle ait tent\u00e9 de le faire. Elle a eu l'impression qu'elle laissait tomber les agentes de son unit\u00e9 parce qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable de faire tout son travail. Jusqu'\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle s'\u00e9tait occup\u00e9e des demandes relatives aux aides familiaux, un travail qui, selon elle, \u00e9tait plus facile \u00e0 apprendre. On s'attendait maintenant \u00e0 ce qu'elle s'occupe de la saisie de donn\u00e9es quant aux demandes industrielles. Elle affirme n'avoir re\u00e7u aucune formation quant \u00e0 ce travail, sauf peut-\u00eatre une formation de vingt minutes avec Diann Luksa.\n[29] La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 que ses crises d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] l'emp\u00eachait de respirer et de penser clairement. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que celles-ci duraient de cinq \u00e0 dix minutes et que, lorsqu'elles \u00e9taient termin\u00e9es, elle se sentait bien. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 que, le ou vers le 28 juin 2001, elle a fait part de son \u00e9tat \u00e0 son superviseur, Rick Levert. M. Levert a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s agit\u00e9e lors de cette rencontre. Elle a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 sans cesse qu'on avait pris les emplois de deux personnes et qu'on les avait comprim\u00e9s en un seul emploi. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il a tent\u00e9 de lui expliquer qu'une seule personne pouvait tr\u00e8s bien s'occuper de ces t\u00e2ches. La question de la formation a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e. Il a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle a dit qu'elle ne pouvait pas permettre que son travail nuise \u00e0 sa sant\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement ajout\u00e9 qu'elle a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle irait voir sa m\u00e9decin et que, apr\u00e8s qu'elle l'aurait vue, elle lui reparlerait.\n[30] Le 28 juin 2001, les agentes ont rencontr\u00e9 de nouveau Mme McIntyre. Les notes de Mme McIntyre font \u00e9tat que, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, on \u00e9tait vraiment inquiet \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9. Les agentes lui ont dit que la plaignante \u00e9tait partie \u00e0 la maison parce qu'elle \u00e9tait malade, et ce, sans les pr\u00e9venir, ce qui, selon Mme McIntyre, \u00e9tait la pratique normale. Elle a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, j'\u00e9tais en train d'examiner toute cette question des \u00e9l\u00e9ments contr\u00f4lables et sachant que Mary \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre aux prises avec un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu dans le pass\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire un probl\u00e8me avec son cou [...] et je ne savais pas ce dont il s'agissait. Vous savez, je pensais \u00e0 des tumeurs et autres choses semblables. Elle a de plus ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] En parlant aux autres superviseurs et \u00e0 l'autre commis, j'ai examin\u00e9 en quoi consistait le travail de Mary \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 des travailleurs \u00e9trangers et j'ai examin\u00e9 en quoi consistaient les emplois [...]. Je tentais d'analyser qu'elle \u00e9tait le meilleur travail de commis au bureau en ce qui concerne les \u00e9l\u00e9ments contr\u00f4lables, la flexibilit\u00e9, le niveau de stress. Il est clair que, d\u00e9j\u00e0, Mme McIntyre savait qu'il y avait un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9, bien qu'elle n'en conn\u00fbt pas l'importance, et que ce probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 avait une incidence sur la plaignante.\n[31] Le 29 juin, la plaignante a envoy\u00e9 un message enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme McIntyre l'informant qu'elle ne rentrerait pas au travail parce qu'elle ne se sentait pas bien. Elle a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 dans ce message qu'elle devait r\u00e9gler un certain nombre de probl\u00e8mes avant de retourner au travail. Le m\u00eame jour, elle a consult\u00e9 le Dr Huschilt, qui, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, rempla\u00e7ait la Dre Mander. Elle s'est alors plainte de douleurs au cou et de stress au travail. Le Dr Huschilt a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de l'envoyer passer des radiographies du cou. Il lui a \u00e9galement prescrit du Flexeril, un relaxant musculaire, et du Tylenol, un analg\u00e9sique.\n[32] Rick Levert a \u00e9galement re\u00e7u, le 29 juin 2001, un message enregistr\u00e9 de la part de la plaignante. Celle-ci l'a inform\u00e9 que sa m\u00e9decin l'avait retir\u00e9e du travail et qu'elle le tiendrait au courant. Il a \u00e9galement re\u00e7u, de la part de la Dre Mander, un billet m\u00e9dical dat\u00e9 du 29 juin 2001 mentionnant que la plaignante recevait des soins m\u00e9dicaux et qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable de travailler.\n[33] La plaignante s'est absent\u00e9e du travail du 30 juin 2001 au 23 juillet 2001. Un billet m\u00e9dical dat\u00e9 du 19 juillet 2001 faisait \u00e9tat de stress occasionn\u00e9 par le travail. La plaignante a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait remis ce billet m\u00e9dical \u00e0 son employeur.\n[34] Rick Levert a communiqu\u00e9 avec la plaignante le 3 juillet afin de s'informer quant \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de son absence. Le 9 juillet, la plaignante a envoy\u00e9 un message enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 Rick Levert dans lequel elle mentionnait qu'elle n'avait pas re\u00e7u le r\u00e9sultat des tests de la part de son m\u00e9decin. Elle a \u00e9galement ajout\u00e9 qu'il serait peut-\u00eatre possible qu'elle retourne bient\u00f4t au travail mais que toutefois, avant qu'elle n'y retourne, si elle y retournait, elle devait clarifier un certain nombre de choses. En contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 que ce \u00e0 quoi elle faisait allusion dans ce message enregistr\u00e9 \u00e9tait au probl\u00e8me qu'elle avait avec la charge de travail et du stress que cela lui occasionnait.\n[35] Lors de son retour au travail le 23 juillet 2001, la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 que, selon elle, rien n'avait chang\u00e9. Selon elle, la direction estimait que son travail pouvait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 par une seule personne. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que durant cette p\u00e9riode elle tentait d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9ment de s'accrocher \u00e0 son emploi. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle se sentait vraiment mal car la relation qu'elle entretenait avec ses coll\u00e8gues de travail \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 avait cess\u00e9 d'exister.\n[36] La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle a rencontr\u00e9 Rick Levert le 25 juillet 2001. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que ce qu'elle avait retenu de cette rencontre \u00e9tait qu'elle n'obtiendrait aucune aide pour s'acquitter de sa charge de travail. Le message qu'on lui transmettait \u00e9tait que son travail pouvait \u00eatre fait par une seule personne.\n[37] Rick Levert a pris des notes lors de cette rencontre. C'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu'il prenait des notes lors d'une rencontre avec la plaignante. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il estimait que la situation devenait de plus en plus compliqu\u00e9e et que, apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 de la question avec Debby McIntyre, ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il serait bon de prendre des notes lors des rencontres. Lors de la rencontre du 25 juillet 2001, il a remarqu\u00e9 que la plaignante n'\u00e9tait pas aussi agit\u00e9e que lors de la rencontre ant\u00e9rieure. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle semblait plus d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Elle l'a inform\u00e9 que sa sant\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas bonne et que cela \u00e9tait un \u00e9tat chronique. Selon elle, sa maladie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9e par le travail. M. Levert se souvient de lui avoir dit que la charge de travail li\u00e9e \u00e0 son emploi \u00e9tait raisonnable. Il se souvient \u00e9galement d'avoir discut\u00e9 avec elle de la question de son retour \u00e0 son poste de CR-03. Il l'a inform\u00e9e que, dans la nouvelle structure du bureau, ce poste n'\u00e9tait plus n\u00e9cessaire. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s cat\u00e9gorique qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas capable de s'acquitter de ses fonctions et qu'elle devait prendre des d\u00e9cisions. M. Levert ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 de fournir des d\u00e9tails quant \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\n[38] La plaignante a \u00e9crit une note \u00e0 Rick Levert et \u00e0 Debby McIntyre le 26 juillet 2001. Dans cette note, elle demandait des \u00e9claircissements concernant ses fonctions et ses responsabilit\u00e9s. Elle y mentionnait \u00e9galement qu'elle d\u00e9sirait r\u00e9gler cette question [Traduction] car le probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9 par le stress et par la charge de travail [\u00e9tait] en train de r\u00e9appara\u00eetre et que la charge de travail suppl\u00e9mentaire [avait] contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'apparition de ce probl\u00e8me.\n[39] Le m\u00eame jour, Rick Levert a rencontr\u00e9 Monica Kington, Esther Davis et Pat Richard pour discuter du fonctionnement op\u00e9rationnel de l'unit\u00e9. M. Levert a pris un certain nombre de notes lors de cette rencontre. La plus grande partie de ces notes renvoie au rendement de la plaignante \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 ainsi qu'\u00e0 des commentaires faits par ses coll\u00e8gues de travail.\n[40] Debby McIntyre est partie en vacances du 23 juillet au 7 ao\u00fbt 2001. \u00c0 son retour, la plaignante commen\u00e7ait ses deux semaines de vacances, donc, comme l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Mme McIntyre elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] comme deux navires qui se croisent en pleine nuit.\n[41] Le 8 ao\u00fbt 2001, Mme McIntyre a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une autre note qui traitait d'une visite de la part d'Esther Davis \u00e0 son bureau. Mme Davis lui a racont\u00e9 que depuis le retour de la plaignante au travail apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle avait remarqu\u00e9 que celle-ci avait [Traduction] repris ses t\u00e2ches dans une certaine mesure et qu'elle [Traduction] travaillait \u00e0 environ 50 p. 100 de son niveau de productivit\u00e9 normal. Mme Davis, dans la note, a \u00e9galement fait \u00e9tat d'une rencontre entre la plaignante et Rick Levert le 25 juillet au cours de laquelle elle avait vu la plaignante se mettre \u00e0 pleurer. Rick Levert a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cela ne s'est pas produit lors de la rencontre du 25 juillet mais plut\u00f4t lors de la rencontre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, le 28 juin 2001.\n[42] Le 9 ao\u00fbt 2001, Mme McIntyre a \u00e9crit une note de service \u00e0 la plaignante en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa note du 26 juillet. Elle a inform\u00e9 la plaignante que Rick Levert avait examin\u00e9 les fonctions de son emploi, en collaboration avec d'autres membres du personnel, et avait conclu que la charge de travail pouvait \u00eatre accomplie par une seule personne. Elle a de plus ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Je partage vos inqui\u00e9tudes en ce qui concerne votre sant\u00e9 et je d\u00e9sire en discuter.\n[43] La plaignante est revenue de vacances le 20 ao\u00fbt 2001 et, ce m\u00eame jour, elle a rencontr\u00e9 sa directrice. Lors de cette rencontre, Debby McIntyre a remis \u00e0 la plaignante une copie de la note de service qu'elle avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9e le 9 ao\u00fbt 2001. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa directrice semblait perturb\u00e9e et d\u00e9\u00e7ue qu'elle demande encore de l'aide. La plaignante se souvient d'avoir discut\u00e9 de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 avec sa directrice lors de cette rencontre mais a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'a re\u00e7u aucune suggestion de sa part quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re d'aborder ce probl\u00e8me. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait fait cette d\u00e9marche suppl\u00e9mentaire pour expliquer \u00e0 sa directrice qu'elle souffrait de crises d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de stress. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s perturb\u00e9e lorsqu'elle a quitt\u00e9 cette rencontre et qu'elle \u00e9tait convaincue que son emploi au bureau d'Oakville \u00e9tait termin\u00e9.\n[44] Selon les notes de Debby McIntyre, la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 que bien qu'elle se sentait capable d'accomplir tout son travail, elle estimait que sa sant\u00e9 constituait toujours un probl\u00e8me. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle ferait de son mieux et verrait comment sa sant\u00e9 se porterait. La plaignante lui a dit que ses crises d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 s'\u00e9taient aggrav\u00e9es et qu'elles \u00e9taient d\u00e9clanch\u00e9es par du stress li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi. Selon Mme McIntyre, c'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que la plaignante lui faisait part de cela.\n[45] Le 21 ao\u00fbt 2001, Esther Davis et Monica Kington sont all\u00e9es voir Debby McIntyre pour lui parler de la plaignante. Toujours selon les notes de Mme McIntyre, elles ont fait remarquer que bien que la plaignante semblait tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9e, son travail accusait du retard. Elles ont mentionn\u00e9 qu'elles avaient des doutes quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des priorit\u00e9s et \u00e0 effectuer ses t\u00e2ches.\n[46] Le 23 ao\u00fbt 2001, la plaignante est retourn\u00e9e voir sa directrice pour lui apporter les statistiques qu'elle avait compil\u00e9es concernant les appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques dont elle devait s'occuper \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 des travailleurs \u00e9trangers. Selon la plaignante, la directrice lui a dit qu'elle \u00e9tait trop occup\u00e9e pour s'en occuper et lui a dit d'aller parler de cela \u00e0 Rick Levert. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Debby McIntyre ne nie pas avoir dit cela. Dans sa note, elle mentionne que, lors de cette rencontre, la plaignante avait les larmes aux yeux. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle lui a demand\u00e9 comment elle allait et la plaignante a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle n'allait pas tr\u00e8s bien et qu'elle devait prendre un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 son emploi et quant \u00e0 sa sant\u00e9. Mme McIntyre a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle a encourag\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 consulter sa m\u00e9decin et \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 si c'\u00e9tait cela dont elle avait besoin.\n[47] Le 30 ao\u00fbt 2001 fut le dernier jour de travail de la plaignante. La plaignante se souvient que les dossiers continuaient de s'empiler et qu'elle devenait de plus en plus malade. Elle se souvient \u00e9galement que Pat Richard \u00e9tait irrit\u00e9e du fait qu'elle ne venait pas \u00e0 bout des dossiers. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, ce jour-l\u00e0, elle devait s'occuper d'un grand nombre de dossiers de recrutement \u00e9tranger pour les demandes industrielles. Elle se souvient avoir envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Debby McIntyre \u00e0 8 h 05 pour lui demander de l'aide quant \u00e0 ces dossiers parce qu'ils devaient \u00eatre trait\u00e9s avant une date limite.\n[48] Dans les notes manuscrites qu'elle a consign\u00e9es quant \u00e0 cette journ\u00e9e, Mme McIntyre mentionne qu'elle s'est rendue au poste de travail de la plaignante apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le courriel. La plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9prouvait toujours des probl\u00e8mes avec un certain nombre de dossiers. Mme McIntyre a alors affirm\u00e9 que Pat Richard \u00e9tait occup\u00e9e et qu'elle demanderait \u00e0 Diann Luksa de l'aider. Elle a \u00e9crit que, vers 10 h 45, Glen Harris, un coll\u00e8gue de travail de la plaignante lui a dit que la plaignante \u00e9tait en train de pleurer dans la salle \u00e0 manger. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle s'y est rendue pour aller chercher la plaignante et lui offrir d'aller dans son bureau pour reprendre ses \u00e9motions avant qu'on ne la reconduise chez elle en voiture. La plaignante lui a dit qu'elle \u00e9tait en proie \u00e0 une crise d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s qu'elle fut calm\u00e9e, elle a ajout\u00e9 que le poste de CR-04 [Traduction] \u00e9tait trop pour elle. Elle a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que sa sant\u00e9 \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e et qu'elle ne pouvait plus continuer \u00e0 travailler.\n[49] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lors de cette crise, elle avait eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 respirer et qu'elle avait comme eu envie de s'\u00e9vanouir. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle tremblait, qu'elle \u00e9tait troubl\u00e9e sur le plan \u00e9motionnel et qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable de penser de fa\u00e7on claire. Elle a de plus ajout\u00e9 que ce n'\u00e9tait pas la premi\u00e8re fois, au cours de cet \u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0, qu'elle \u00e9tait en proie \u00e0 une crise de panique. Ces crises duraient environ 10 minutes puis, apr\u00e8s, elle se sentait mal.\n[50] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme McIntyre a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante si elle avait consult\u00e9 sa m\u00e9decin r\u00e9cemment et la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle l'avait vue la journ\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente et que celle-ci voulait qu'elle prenne certains m\u00e9dicaments. Mme McIntyre a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle a encourag\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 consulter sa m\u00e9decin une fois de plus, le plus t\u00f4t possible, et de s\u00e9rieusement examiner \u00e0 nouveau la question des m\u00e9dicaments.\n[51] Dans ses notes du 30 ao\u00fbt 2001, Mme McIntyre a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle a dit \u00e0 la plaignante qu'elle estimait que, pour son propre bien-\u00eatre ainsi que pour le bon fonctionnement de l'unit\u00e9, elle ne pouvait pas lui offrir le poste de CR-04 apr\u00e8s le 30 septembre 2001. Durant son interrogatoire, elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle ne voulait pas que la plaignante s'en aille ce jour-l\u00e0 en croyant qu'elle devait r\u00e9int\u00e9grer cet emploi. Mme McIntyre a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle a fait part \u00e0 la plaignante qu'aucun poste de CR-03 n'\u00e9tait disponible aux bureaux d'Oakville et de Burlington. Elle a offert de demander au directeur des services administratifs de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 Mississauga-Est pour v\u00e9rifier s'il n'y aurait pas, ailleurs, un poste de CR-03 qui serait disponible.\n[52] Le 28 septembre 2001, la plaignante a re\u00e7u une lettre de la part de Debby McIntyre l'informant que le contrat pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e dont elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait quant \u00e0 son poste CR-03 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 d'un mois [Traduction] comme mesure de dotation int\u00e9rimaire, afin de [lui] permettre de voir s'il y n'aurait pas des postes de CR-03 vacants \u00e0 Peel-Halton-Dufferin sur lesquels [elle] pourrait postuler.\n[53] Le 10 octobre 2001, Debby McIntyre a eu avec la plaignante un entretien t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique au cours duquel elle lui a mentionn\u00e9 qu'un poste de CR-03 \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre libre au bureau de Mississauga-Ouest de l'intim\u00e9. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle serait heureuse de rencontrer Vicky Shea, la directrice de ce bureau, pour discuter de cette possibilit\u00e9. Mme Shea n'a cependant jamais communiqu\u00e9 avec elle.\n[54] Le 22 octobre 2001, la plaignante a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Mme McIntyre dans laquelle elle mentionnait que son employeur \u00e9tait tenu de l'accommoder. Elle demandait dans cette lettre \u00e0 ce qu'elle puisse demeurer en cong\u00e9 sans solde jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle se porte suffisamment bien pour retourner au travail.\n[55] Le 29 octobre 2001, elle a re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette lettre dans laquelle sa directrice a notamment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] l'obligation d'accommodement vise l'aide sur le plan technique aux personnes handicap\u00e9es dans le contexte de l'am\u00e9nagement en milieu de travail - et vous vous trompez en croyant que l'obligation d'accommodement comprend les prolongations de contrat dans un endroit o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de poste disponible.\n[56] Le 27 mai 2002, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\nIV. LE T\u00c9MOIGNAGE DE LA DRE CHARANJEAT MANDER [57] La seul t\u00e9moignage m\u00e9dical qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par les parties a \u00e9t\u00e9 celui de la Dre Charanjeat Mander, la m\u00e9decin de famille de la plaignante.\n[58] La Dre Mander a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la m\u00e9decine au Christian Medical College, dans la ville de Ludhiana (Punjab), en Inde, et elle y a obtenu un dipl\u00f4me de m\u00e9decine en 1965. Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu son dipl\u00f4me, elle a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 avec son mari \u00e0 Glasgow (\u00c9cosse), o\u00f9 elle a fait une r\u00e9sidence d'un an en psychiatrie. En 1974, la famille a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 au Canada o\u00f9 elle a fait son internat en m\u00e9decine interne \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital St. Joseph (maintenant connu sous le nom de Queensway Health Centre) de Toronto. En 1979, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9ussi son examen l'autorisant \u00e0 pratiquer la m\u00e9decine, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 exercer sa pratique m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 Burlington o\u00f9 elle pratique encore aujourd'hui la m\u00e9decine g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[59] La Dre Mander a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue comme experte en m\u00e9decine familiale et a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner comme m\u00e9decin traitant de la plaignante.\n[60] La Dre Mander a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle rencontrait beaucoup de cas d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le cadre de sa pratique. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, en raison du manque de psychiatre, les omnipraticiens jouent un r\u00f4le important dans le traitement des personnes qui souffrent d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Les sympt\u00f4mes les plus courants de l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 sont la nervosit\u00e9, les palpitations et le manque de sommeil. Normalement, lorsqu'un patient se pr\u00e9sente avec ces sympt\u00f4mes, le m\u00e9decin doit l'\u00e9couter attentivement et doit d\u00e9celer les motifs de l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans de tels cas, l'histoire du patient est la chose la plus importante.\n[61] La Dre Mander a mentionn\u00e9 que, dans ces cas, elle recommande d'abord du repos ou quelques jours de cong\u00e9. La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du traitement consiste \u00e0 prescrire un tranquillisant l\u00e9ger, Ativan par exemple. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, \u00e0 ce stade, elle prescrit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement cinq milligrammes, sublingual, pour voir comment le patient r\u00e9agit. Si cela ne fonctionne pas, elle envisage la possibilit\u00e9 de prescrire un tranquillisant plus puissant. La troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape consiste \u00e0 renvoyer le patient \u00e0 un sp\u00e9cialiste.\n[62] La Dre Mander a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle a d'abord vu la plaignante \u00e0 titre de m\u00e9decin de famille le 5 octobre 1999, bien qu'elle l'e\u00fbt vu le 29 octobre 1997, alors qu'elle rempla\u00e7ait la m\u00e9decin de famille ant\u00e9rieure de la plaignante.\n[63] Les notes cliniques de la Dre Mander font \u00e9tat que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 vue le 26 juin 2001 par le Dr Huschilt, qui, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la rempla\u00e7ait dans sa pratique. Dans ses notes, elle relate que le Dr Huschilt a mentionn\u00e9 que lors de cette visite la plaignante s'\u00e9tait plainte d'une douleur au cou et de stress au travail. La plaignante a consult\u00e9 une fois de plus le Dr Huschilt le 29 juin 2001 et elle s'est plainte de stress au travail. Le Dr Huschilt a conclu \u00e0 l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et il a prescrit une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9.\n[64] La Dre Mander a vu la plaignante le 19 juillet 2001. Elle a inscrit ce qui suit : [Traduction] Stress au travail - trop de travail. Douleurs au cou. A besoin de changement au travail. Fait le travail de deux personnes. Stress \u00e9motionnel. Tr\u00e8s angoiss\u00e9e. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la plaignante \u00e9tait absente du travail depuis le 29 juin 2001. La plaignante a dit \u00e0 la Dre Mander qu'elle voulait retourner au travail mais \u00e0 condition que des changements soient apport\u00e9s au milieu de travail.\n[65] La m\u00e9decin a vu la plaignante une autre fois le 3 ao\u00fbt 2001. Bien qu'elle n'en ait pas fait mention dans ses notes, la Dre Mander a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait toujours tendue. La plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa m\u00e9decin qu'elle avait \u00e9crit \u00e0 sa directrice \u00e0 propos de ses probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail mais que celle-ci \u00e9tait en vacances \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Elle a dit \u00e0 la Dre Mander qu'elle allait prendre 10 jours de vacances, ce qui devrait l'aider \u00e0 devenir un peu plus stable.\n[66] Le prochain rendez-vous de la plaignante devait avoir lieu le 28 ao\u00fbt 2001. Elle venait tout juste de retourner au travail. Dans ses notes, la Dre Mander a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [Traduction] Crises d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, palpitations, nervosit\u00e9, souffle court une \u00e0 deux fois par semaine [...] sympt\u00f4mes typiques d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. \u00c0 l'audience, la Dre Mander a ajout\u00e9 que lors de cette visite, la plaignante pleurait, \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s nerveuse et que ses mains tremblaient. La plaignante lui a dit qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s nerveuse et qu'elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 dormir. La Dre Mander lui a prescrit du Ativan, un tranquillisant, \u00e0 raison de 0,5 milligramme, sublingual, \u00e0 utiliser au besoin. Elle a \u00e9galement pris note que la plaignante \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s perturb\u00e9e par sa charge de travail.\n[67] La Dre Mander a vu la plaignante une nouvelle fois le 31 ao\u00fbt 2001. Elle a soulign\u00e9 que celle-ci lui a dit qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas capable de s'acquitter de sa t\u00e2che, qu'il y avait trop de pression. Elle a \u00e9galement pris note que la plaignante pleurait et qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s perturb\u00e9e. La plaignante a dit \u00e0 la Dre Mander qu'elle ne voulait pas retourner \u00e0 son emploi dans les circonstances qui pr\u00e9valaient \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Elle voulait que la direction lui retire les t\u00e2ches suppl\u00e9mentaires qu'on lui avait pr\u00e9tendument donn\u00e9es. La Dre Mander a inscrit ce qui suit : [Traduction] Les crises de panique sont occasionn\u00e9es par la pression. Elle a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante une note dans laquelle il \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Doit s'absenter du travail pour une p\u00e9riode de temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Tr\u00e8s grand stress au travail. Fardeau de travail trop lourd.\n[68] La plaignante est retourn\u00e9e voir sa m\u00e9decin le 4 septembre 2001. La Dre Mander a pris note qu'elle se sentait mieux parce qu'elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9. La plaignante a dit \u00e0 sa m\u00e9decin qu'elle dormait mieux et qu'elle [Traduction] n'\u00e9prouvait plus de sensation de panique. La Dre Mander a ajout\u00e9 que la plaignante ne prenait aucun antid\u00e9presseur \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 parce qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9prim\u00e9e.\n[69] Le 10 septembre 2001, la Dre Mander a pris des dispositions pour renvoyer la plaignante \u00e0 une sp\u00e9cialiste, la Dre V. M. Celine Kumiranayake, une psychiatre clinique \u00e0 Burlington. Selon la Dre Mander, la plaignante a vu la Dre Kumiranayake le 18 septembre 2001. La Dre Kumiranayake, qui est maintenant \u00e0 la retraite, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Elle a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la Dre Mander un rapport d'\u00e9valuation de la plaignante. La Dre Mander a re\u00e7u ce rapport le 20 septembre 2001. La Dre Kumiranayake n'a plus revu la plaignante apr\u00e8s cette rencontre.\n[70] Selon la Dre Mander, le diagnostic de la Dre Kumiranayake quant \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e9tait le suivant : [Traduction] Crises de panique aigu\u00ebs occasionn\u00e9es par du stress li\u00e9 au travail. Dans son rapport, la Dre Kumiranayake a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [Traduction] Cette dame semble souffrir de crises de panique aigu\u00ebs occasionn\u00e9es par du stress li\u00e9 au travail. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[71] L'inscription suivante faite par la Dre Mander est dat\u00e9e du 25 septembre 2001. La m\u00e9decin a inscrit que la plaignante se sentait plus heureuse, et qu'elle avait une attitude positive et qu'elle n'\u00e9tait plus en proie \u00e0 des crises de panique. La plaignante a dit \u00e0 sa m\u00e9decin qu'elle ne voulait prendre aucun m\u00e9dicament car elle se sentait maintenant mieux.\n[72] Le 18 octobre 2001, la plaignante a consult\u00e9 de nouveau la Dre Mander. Selon les notes de la m\u00e9decin, celle-ci commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 souffrir du stress en raison de [Traduction] certains probl\u00e8mes avec l'employeur [...] concernant des invalidit\u00e9s. La Dre Mander n'a fait aucune remarque quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat physique de la plaignante.\n[73] Le rendez-vous suivant a eu lieu le 9 novembre 2001. La m\u00e9decin a pris note que la plaignante \u00e9tait [Traduction] fatigu\u00e9e, d\u00e9prim\u00e9e, anxieuse, tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tendue. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui prescrire du Paxil, un antid\u00e9presseur, parce qu'elle estimait que l'\u00e9tat de la plaignante ne s'am\u00e9liorait pas, malgr\u00e9 qu'elle f\u00fbt en cong\u00e9. En contre-interrogatoire, elle a ajout\u00e9 que la plaignante lui avait plus tard dit qu'elle n'avait jamais pris l'antid\u00e9presseur.\n[74] Le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2001, la Dre Mander a vu la plaignante. Celle-ci semblait mieux se porter et elle a fait part de son intention de retourner au travail. La Dre Mander a remis \u00e0 la plaignante un billet m\u00e9dical mentionnant qu'elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 retourner travailler \u00e0 plein temps.\n[75] Lors de son contre-interrogatoire, la Dre Mander a admis qu'elle n'avait personnellement aucune id\u00e9e de ce qui se passait dans le milieu de travail de la plaignante et que, quant \u00e0 cela, elle s'\u00e9tait uniquement fi\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante. Elle a de plus ajout\u00e9 que son r\u00f4le consistait \u00e0 observer la patiente et qu'elle n'avait pas \u00e0 se m\u00ealer de ce qu'elle a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant [Traduction] les probl\u00e8mes juridiques qui existent entre le milieu de travail et la patiente. Elle a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que la plaignante souffrait d'une d\u00e9pression r\u00e9actionnelle \u00e0 son milieu de travail, ce qui ne signifie pas que la plaignante souffrait d'une d\u00e9pression clinique.\nV. LA LOI Aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les articles pertinents de la Loi sont les suivants :\n3. (1) Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n15. (1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l'employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu'ils d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l'alin\u00e9a (1)g), s'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n25. Les d\u00e9finitions qui suivent s'appliquent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi.\nd\u00e9ficience D\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu'elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, y compris le d\u00e9figurement ainsi que la d\u00e9pendance, pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, envers l'alcool ou la drogue.\nVI. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE Les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente instance sont les suivantes :\nLa plaignante a-t-elle \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination?\nSi une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, l'intim\u00e9 a-t-il omis d'accommoder la plaignante?\nVII. ANALYSE JURIDIQUE [76] Dans les arr\u00eats Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 [\u00e9galement appel\u00e9 l'arr\u00eat Meiorin] et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 [\u00e9galement appel\u00e9 l'arr\u00eat Grismer], la Cour supr\u00eame a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il incombe d'abord au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur. [Voir Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne)O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Limited, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, p. 558.]\n[77] Dans l'arr\u00eat La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, (Morris) 2005 CAF 154, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la d\u00e9finition juridique de la preuve prima facie n'exige pas que le plaignant soumette un type particulier de preuve afin de d\u00e9montrer qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un acte discriminatoire. Un crit\u00e8re souple est plus appropri\u00e9.\n[78] L'article 3 de la Loi d\u00e9clare que la d\u00e9ficience est un motif de distinction illicite. D\u00e9ficience est d\u00e9finie \u00e0 l'article 25 comme \u00e9tant une d\u00e9ficience physique [...], qu'elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e.\n[79] Une question cruciale en l'esp\u00e8ce est celle qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si la plaignante souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience. Dans l'arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville) et Boisbriand (Ville), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665 [\u00e9galement appel\u00e9 l'arr\u00eat Mercier], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a fait un certain nombre de remarques importantes concernant les fa\u00e7ons selon lesquelles les cours de justice doivent examiner et consid\u00e9rer les d\u00e9ficiences. La Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9num\u00e8re un crit\u00e8re juridique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la mani\u00e8re d'\u00e9tablir s'il y a oui ou non d\u00e9ficience au sens des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[80] Bien que l'arr\u00eat Mercier soit rattach\u00e9 \u00e0 la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec et non pas \u00e0 la Loi, les remarques de la Cour s'appliquent tout autant \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les deux lois pr\u00e9voient des mesures de protection semblables. La Cour s'est pench\u00e9e sur le sens et la port\u00e9e du mot handicap, lequel est utilis\u00e9 dans la Charte qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise pour d\u00e9signer une d\u00e9ficience. La Cour a notamment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n75 On retrouve la d\u00e9finition suivante du terme d\u00e9savantage (handicap en anglais) dans la Classification internationale des handicaps :\nDans le domaine de la sant\u00e9, le d\u00e9savantage social d'un individu est le pr\u00e9judice qui r\u00e9sulte de sa d\u00e9ficience ou de son incapacit\u00e9 et qui limite ou interdit l'accomplissement d'un r\u00f4le consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme normal compte tenu de l'\u00e2ge, du sexe et des facteurs socio-culturels.\n76 Je suis enti\u00e8rement d'accord avec le juge Philippon qu'il ne faut pas enfermer le motif de handicap dans une d\u00e9finition \u00e9tanche et d\u00e9pourvue de souplesse. Au lieu de cr\u00e9er une d\u00e9finition exhaustive de ce concept, il me semble plus utile de proposer des lignes directrices qui faciliteront l'interpr\u00e9tation tout en permettant aux tribunaux d'adapter la notion de handicap selon divers facteurs biom\u00e9dicaux, sociaux ou technologiques. Compte tenu de l'avancement rapide de la technologie biom\u00e9dicale et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, de la technologie g\u00e9n\u00e9tique et du fait que ce qui aujourd'hui constitue un handicap peut l'\u00eatre ou ne pas l'\u00eatre demain, une d\u00e9finition trop \u00e9tanche ne servirait pas n\u00e9cessairement l'objet de la Charte en cette mati\u00e8re.\n77 Ces lignes directrices pourraient \u00eatre en accord de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avec le mod\u00e8le socio-politique que propose J. E. Bickenbach, Physical Disability and Social Policy (1993). Ce n'est toutefois pas dire qu'il faille \u00e9carter les fondements biom\u00e9dicaux du handicap mais plut\u00f4t souligner que, pour les fins de la Charte, il importe d'aller au-del\u00e0 de ce seul crit\u00e8re. C'est alors qu'une approche multidimensionnelle qui tient compte de l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment socio-politique s'av\u00e8re tr\u00e8s pertinente. En mettant l'emphase sur la dignit\u00e9 humaine, le respect et le droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, plut\u00f4t que sur la condition biom\u00e9dicale tout court, cette approche reconna\u00eet que les attitudes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et de ses membres contribuent souvent \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e ou \u00e0 la perception d'un handicap. Ainsi, une personne peut n'avoir aucune limitation dans la vie courante sauf celles qui sont cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le pr\u00e9judice et les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes.\n78 I. B. McKenna, dans Legal Rights for Persons with Disabilities in Canada: Can the Impasse Be Resolved? (1997-98), 29 R.D. Ottawa 153, a \u00e9crit ceci au sujet de la port\u00e9e du terme handicap \u00e0 la p. 164 :\n[TRADUCTION] C'est l'effet conjugu\u00e9 de la d\u00e9ficience ou de l'incapacit\u00e9 d'une personne et du climat social qui d\u00e9termine si cette personne est atteinte d'un handicap.\nAu m\u00eame effet, le professeur Proulx, loc. cit., \u00e0 la p. 416, affirme que\nce qui compte en mati\u00e8re de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le handicap, ce n'est pas tant de savoir si la victime d'une exclusion a un v\u00e9ritable handicap ou est r\u00e9ellement une personne handicap\u00e9e au sens o\u00f9 on l'entend dans d'autres lois \u00e9dict\u00e9es pour d'autres fins ou m\u00eame au sens ordinaire de ces termes. Le centre de l'analyse n'est pas tant la notion de handicap, en soi, que celle de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le handicap.\nVoir \u00e9galement Lepofsky et Bickenbach, op. cit., \u00e0 la p. 343.\n79. Ainsi, un handicap peut r\u00e9sulter aussi bien d'une limitation physique que d'une affection, d'une construction sociale, d'une perception de limitation ou d'une combinaison de tous ces facteurs. C'est l'effet de l'ensemble de ces circonstances qui d\u00e9termine si l'individu est ou non affect\u00e9 d'un handicap pour les fins de la Charte.\n[81] Donc, si l'on veut savoir si une personne souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience, le Tribunal devra tenir compte non seulement de la condition biom\u00e9dicale du plaignant, mais \u00e9galement des circonstances dans lesquelles une distinction est faite. La Cour ajoute ce qui suit au paragraphe 80 : Dans le cadre de l'acte reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 un employeur, les tribunaux doivent se demander, entre autres, si une affection r\u00e9elle ou per\u00e7ue engendre pour l'individu [TRADUCTION] la perte ou la diminution des possibilit\u00e9s de participer \u00e0 la vie collective au m\u00eame titre que les autres.\n[82] Une d\u00e9ficience n'exige pas obligatoirement la preuve d'une limitation physique ou la pr\u00e9sence d'une affection quelconque. Bien que la Cour supr\u00eame nous rappelle qu'il ne faut pas trop se fonder sur des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pour \u00e9tablir s'il existe ou non une d\u00e9ficience, il ne suffit pas qu'une personne dise tout simplement qu'elle souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience pour qu'il soit satisfait au crit\u00e8re. Il faut prouver que la d\u00e9ficience existe. Cette preuve peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux et du contexte dans lequel l'acte reproch\u00e9 s'est produit.\n[83] Dans une r\u00e9cente d\u00e9cision, Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il y avait preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience en se fondant fortement sur le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante ainsi que sur celui de son m\u00e9decin de famille. En contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que la conclusion du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable, principalement pour le motif que la preuve m\u00e9dicale produite \u00e0 l'appui de la conclusion \u00e9tait celle d'un expert en m\u00e9decine familiale et qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable de conclure que le t\u00e9moignage de ce m\u00e9decin devrait peser plus lourd que l'opinion d'un m\u00e9decin sp\u00e9cialiste. La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucune preuve prima facie \u00e0 r\u00e9futer car elle n'\u00e9tait pas convaincue qu'il y avait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement recevables pour \u00e9tayer une conclusion de d\u00e9ficience.\n[84] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [2005 CAF 311] a jug\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de la juge si\u00e9geant en r\u00e9vision \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e. Elle a conclu que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la question de savoir s'il y avait ou non d\u00e9ficience \u00e9tait manifestement une d\u00e9cision qui m\u00e9ritait une grande retenue. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Granovsky c. Canada, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 703, au paragraphe 34, ainsi que dans l'arr\u00eat Mercier, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 71, la d\u00e9ficience au sens juridique consiste en une affection physique ou mentale qui occasionne une limitation fonctionnelle ou qui est associ\u00e9e \u00e0 une perception d'affection. Compte tenu de ce crit\u00e8re, la Cour d'appel a conclu que le Tribunal disposait d'une preuve \u00e0 partir de laquelle il pouvait raisonnablement conclure qu'il y avait d\u00e9ficience.\n[85] En l'esp\u00e8ce, comme dans l'affaire Desormeaux, l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que la preuve m\u00e9dicale n'\u00e9tait pas concluante. Bien que l'on pourrait conclure que la preuve m\u00e9dicale n'\u00e9tait pas tout \u00e0 fait convaincante, celle-ci, conjugu\u00e9e avec la preuve de la plaignante et celle de l'intim\u00e9, permet de conclure qu'il y a d\u00e9ficience.\n[86] L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9, au cours de ses plaidoiries, une d\u00e9cision que j'ai rendue dans Beauregard c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, [2004] T.C.D.P. n\u00b0 1 (confirm\u00e9e, 2005 CF 1384). Il est important de souligner que les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce dans l'affaire Beauregard \u00e9taient quelque peu diff\u00e9rents des faits de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce. Dans Beauregard, la preuve m\u00e9dicale invoqu\u00e9e par le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite par le psychiatre de l'intim\u00e9e ainsi que par sa preuve d'expert. De plus, dans cette cause, il n'y avait pas d'incidents au travail montrant clairement que le plaignant souffrait de probl\u00e8mes d'ordre m\u00e9dical.\n[87] En ce qui a trait aux crises de panique, le British Columbia Council of Human Rights, dans Sansome c. Dodd (c.o.b Portside Paul's Fish & Chips), [1991] B.C.C.H.R.D. no 17, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elles constituaient une d\u00e9ficience au sens du B.C. Human Rights Code (voir \u00e9galement Cameron c. Fletcher Challenge Canada Limited (1995), 24 C.H.R.R. D.\/506 (B.C.C.H.R.)).\n[88] La Loi ne renferme aucune liste \u00e9num\u00e9rant les d\u00e9ficiences mentales acceptables et les d\u00e9ficiences mentales non acceptables. Ce ne sont pas seulement les d\u00e9ficiences mentales les plus graves qui ont droit \u00e0 la protection pr\u00e9vue dans la Loi. De plus, ce ne sont pas seulement les d\u00e9ficiences qui constituent une incapacit\u00e9 permanente qui doivent \u00eatre prises en compte. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, m\u00eame les d\u00e9ficiences mentales d\u00e9crites comme \u00e9tant mineures et qui ne se manifestent pas d'une fa\u00e7on permanente pourraient avoir droit \u00e0 la protection pr\u00e9vue dans la Loi. Toutefois, l'existence d'une d\u00e9ficience doit toujours \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par une preuve suffisante.\n[89] Pour les fins du crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie, je conclus qu'il existe une preuve manifeste que la plaignante souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience, notamment de crises de panique. Je conclus \u00e9galement que sa directrice \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, Mme McIntyre, aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre en mesure de conclure, \u00e0 partir des conversations qu'elle a eues avec la plaignante ainsi qu'\u00e0 partir de ses observations, que, au point de vue sant\u00e9, les choses n'allaient pas bien.\n[90] Lors de la rencontre du 21 juin 2001, la plaignante a dit \u00e0 Mme McIntyre qu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 nouveau en proie \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Mme McIntyre savait \u00e9galement que la plaignante avait consult\u00e9 sa m\u00e9decin. Elle a de plus appris, le 27 juin 2001, que la plaignante avait soulev\u00e9 la question de sa sant\u00e9 lors d'une rencontre avec ses coll\u00e8gues de travail. Elle a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s perturb\u00e9e lors de cette rencontre.\n[91] Le 28 juin 2001, la plaignante a fait part de son \u00e9tat \u00e0 son superviseur, Rick Levert. Celui-ci a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, au cours de cette rencontre, la plaignante \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s agit\u00e9e. Il a ajout\u00e9 que, \u00e0 un certain moment, elle s'est mise \u00e0 pleurer. La plaignante a \u00e9galement fait part \u00e0 son superviseur qu'elle consultait sa m\u00e9decin. Le m\u00eame jour, Mme McIntyre a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par les coll\u00e8gues de travail de la plaignante que celle-ci \u00e9tait partie chez elle parce qu'elle \u00e9tait malade. Mme McIntyre savait \u00e9galement que [Traduction] Mary avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9.\n[92] Rick Levert a appris, le 29 juin 2001, que la m\u00e9decin de la plaignante avait prescrit \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. La plaignante s'est absent\u00e9e du travail du 30 juin 2001 au 23 juillet 2001 et les documents m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 l'appui remis \u00e0 l'employeur faisaient \u00e9tat de stress occasionn\u00e9 par le travail. Juste apr\u00e8s son retour au travail, le 25 juillet 2001, la plaignante a rencontr\u00e9 son superviseur et l'a inform\u00e9 que sa sant\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas bonne et qu'il s'agissait d'un \u00e9tat permanent.\n[93] Dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Debby McIntyre et \u00e0 Rick Levert, le 26 juillet 2001, la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 nouveau en proie \u00e0 son [Traduction] probl\u00e8me de stress occasionn\u00e9 par la charge de travail. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette lettre, le 9 ao\u00fbt 2001, Debby McIntyre a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Je partage vos inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 votre sant\u00e9.\n[94] Le 20 ao\u00fbt 2001, lors d'une rencontre avec Debby McIntyre, la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle croyait toujours que sa sant\u00e9 posait probl\u00e8me. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle souffrait de crises de panique incessantes, lesquelles \u00e9taient occasionn\u00e9es par son travail. Lors d'une autre rencontre, le 23 ao\u00fbt 2001, Debby McIntyre a soulign\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait en larmes. Mme McIntyre a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante comment elle se portait et celle-ci lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne se portait pas tr\u00e8s bien et qu'elle devait prendre un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions concernant son emploi. Mme McIntyre l'a encourag\u00e9e \u00e0 consulter sa m\u00e9decin et \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 au besoin.\n[95] Puis, il y a eu les \u00e9v\u00e8nements du 30 ao\u00fbt 2001, lesquels ont clairement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait aux prises avec un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9.\n[96] Mme McIntyre a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas l'impression que les crises d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 dont avait parl\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e9taient une maladie. Au contraire, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle croyait comprendre que le stress et l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e9taient occasionn\u00e9s par le fait qu'elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 faire le travail d'un CR-04. Selon moi, il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une reconnaissance de sa part qu'elle savait que la plaignante souffrait de stress et d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 mais que, selon elle, il s'agissait d'une question de rendement.\n[97] Tous les \u00e9v\u00e8nements d\u00e9crits ci-dessus auraient d\u00fb susciter des soup\u00e7ons. Je conclus, compte tenu de tous ces \u00e9v\u00e8nements que l'intim\u00e9 savait, ou aurait d\u00fb savoir que la plaignante souffrait d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9e par du stress li\u00e9 au travail. Le fait qu'elle ne l'ait pas dit express\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 ne lui fait pas perdre la protection de la Loi (voir Mager c. Louisiana-Pacific Canada Ltd., [1998] B.C.H.R.T.D. no 36.) Pour sa part, si l'intim\u00e9 croyait que le stress occasionn\u00e9 par le travail ne constitue pas une d\u00e9ficience, il aurait d\u00fb soumettre la plaignante \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation professionnelle.\n[98] Il ne suffit pas pour l'intim\u00e9 d'affirmer qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 ou qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante. Certes, compte tenu de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il est manifeste qu'il devait savoir qu'elle se trouvait dans ce qui pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un \u00e9tat \u00e9motionnel fragile. Sachant ce qu'il savait, il appartenait \u00e0 l'employeur d'\u00e9tablir si l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante avait une incidence sur son rendement. Il lui incombait \u00e0 tout le moins de se demander si l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante pourrait avoir une incidence sur sa d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier la plaignante.\n[99] M\u00eame si la plaignante n'a remis \u00e0 l'employeur aucun diagnostic m\u00e9dical de sa d\u00e9ficience, cela ne la prive pas de la protection de la Loi. Il se peut qu'une personne souffrant d'une d\u00e9ficience, notamment une personne souffrant d'une d\u00e9ficience mentale, ne connaisse pas la nature et l'importance exacte de cette d\u00e9ficience au moment o\u00f9 elle est en proie aux sympt\u00f4mes. Dans de telles circonstances, nous ne pouvons pas imposer une obligation de divulgation d'un diagnostic m\u00e9dical concluant.\n[100] Je ne minimise pas l'importance du fait qu'un employ\u00e9 doive soumettre \u00e0 son employeur des billets m\u00e9dicaux informant ce dernier de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. L'employeur se fie \u00e0 ces billets pour conna\u00eetre l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de l'employ\u00e9 dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela est pertinent avec le besoin d'accommodement. Je soup\u00e7onne cependant que la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s h\u00e9sitent \u00e0 informer leur employeur qu'ils souffrent peut-\u00eatre d'une d\u00e9ficience mentale. Ils craignent qu'un employeur n'utilise ces renseignements \u00e0 leur d\u00e9triment et estiment qu'il est dans leur int\u00e9r\u00eat de r\u00e9gler leurs probl\u00e8mes du mieux qu'ils le peuvent.\n[101] Le changement \u00e9vident dans le comportement de la plaignante au cours des mois de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2001 aurait d\u00fb faire r\u00e9aliser \u00e0 l'employeur que quelque chose n'allait pas. La plaignante a inform\u00e9 sa directrice et son superviseur durant cette p\u00e9riode que ce n'\u00e9tait parce qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9e par son travail que celui-ci n'\u00e9tait pas fait mais plut\u00f4t parce qu'elle avait un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9. Son employeur, pour sa part, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, compte tenu des renseignements qu'il recevait de la part des coll\u00e8gues de travail de la plaignante, qu'il s'agissait d'une question de rendement et non pas d'une question de d\u00e9ficience.\n[102] Mme McIntyre \u00e9tait convaincue que la plaignante n'\u00e9tait pas capable d'accomplir la t\u00e2che d'un CR-04. Elle croyait sinc\u00e8rement que la plaignante estimait que le travail n'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9alisable et qu'elle ne voulait rien entendre quant aux fa\u00e7ons qui lui permettraient de le rendre r\u00e9alisable. Mme McIntyre estimait que la directrice \u00e9tait tenue de voir \u00e0 la stabilit\u00e9 de l'unit\u00e9 afin d'appuyer les agents. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la plaignante avait un historique. Elle voulait dire par l\u00e0 qu'elle avait remarqu\u00e9 que la plaignante avait pris l'habitude de travailler pendant un certain temps, puis, de prendre cong\u00e9. Cette conclusion est int\u00e9ressante compte tenu du fait qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 Marg Garey \u00e9tait la directrice de la plaignante et qu'aucune mention de cet historique n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 Mme McIntyre lorsque celle-ci a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 au poste de directrice. La preuve n'\u00e9taye pas cette conclusion.\n[103] L'intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb tenter de savoir pourquoi le travail s'empilait; pourquoi le rendement de l'employ\u00e9e diminuait. Compte tenu de la preuve dont il \u00e9tait saisi, l'intim\u00e9 ne pouvait tout simplement pas sauter \u00e0 la conclusion que ce probl\u00e8me de rendement d\u00e9coulait d'une attitude n\u00e9gative.\n[104] En l'esp\u00e8ce, il est clair que la d\u00e9cision finale de ne pas renouveler le contrat de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par la d\u00e9ficience de cette derni\u00e8re. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il suffit d'examiner les notes prises le 30 ao\u00fbt 2001 par Mme McIntyre. Ces notes mettent en \u00e9vidence une conversation que celle-ci a eue avec un repr\u00e9sentant des relations en dotation au bureau r\u00e9gional de l'intim\u00e9 et au cours de laquelle elle a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Renouveler le contrat de Mary le 30 septembre 2001, ne serait pas, selon moi, une bonne chose pour la sant\u00e9 de Mary. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.] Cela, en soi, est suffisant pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La sant\u00e9 ou la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante \u00e9tait de toute \u00e9vidence pr\u00e9sente dans l'esprit de l'intim\u00e9 lorsqu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas continuer \u00e0 l'employer\n[105] D\u00e8s qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il appartient \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la norme ou politique apparemment discriminatoire qu'il a appliqu\u00e9e est une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Afin d'\u00e9tablir ceci, selon les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer, l'intim\u00e9 doit prouver ce qui suit :\nIl a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but ou objectif rationnellement li\u00e9 aux fonctions exerc\u00e9es Il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de son objet, et sans qu'il ait eu l'intention de faire de preuve de discrimination envers le demandeur; La norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour que l'employeur puisse atteindre l'objet qu'elle vise. L'employeur doit \u00e9tablir qu'il lui est impossible de composer avec le demandeur et les autres personnes l\u00e9s\u00e9es par la norme sans subir une contrainte excessive.\n[106] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la norme ou politique appliqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 serait la d\u00e9cision d'abolir le poste de CR-03 que la plaignante occupait et de ne pas renouveler son contrat \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[107] Les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer traitent des param\u00e8tres servant \u00e0 juger si une d\u00e9fense de contrainte excessive a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour a soulign\u00e9 que l'utilisation de l'adjectif excessive donne \u00e0 penser qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable. Seule la contrainte excessive r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re. Une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue peut \u00eatre id\u00e9ale du point de vue de l'employeur. Cependant, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu des lois sur les droits de la personne, la norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 intrins\u00e8ques de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive.\n[108] La Cour supr\u00eame a soulign\u00e9 que le d\u00e9fendeur, afin de s'acquitter de ce fardeau, doit toujours d\u00e9montrer que la norme inclut toute possibilit\u00e9 d'accommoder sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive (voir Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 32.). Il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer qu'il a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d'accommodement. L'intim\u00e9 doit prouver qu'il \u00e9tait impossible d'incorporer dans la norme des aspects d'accommodement individuel sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive (voir Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 4).\n[109] Dans Gardiner c. British Columbia (Attorney General), [2003] B.C.H.R.T.D. no 40, le British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit concernant l'obligation d'accommodement (aux paragraphes 168 et 169) :\n[Traduction]\nIl est important de faire une distinction entre l'existence de la d\u00e9ficience et l'incidence fonctionnelle de la d\u00e9ficience \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode donn\u00e9e. Une personne peut souffrir d'une maladie ou d'une blessure permanente qui constitue une d\u00e9ficience en vertu du Code, mais ne souffre d'aucune incidence fonctionnelle de longue dur\u00e9e en raison de cette d\u00e9ficience : Morris c. B.C. Rail 2003 BCHRT 14. Dans de telles circonstances, si l'existence de la d\u00e9ficience n'est pas port\u00e9e \u00e0 l'attention du d\u00e9fendeur et qu'aucun accommodement n'est exig\u00e9, le d\u00e9fendeur peut tr\u00e8s bien ne pas \u00eatre au courant de l'existence de la d\u00e9ficience et en fait on ne peut raisonnablement pas s'attendre \u00e0 ce qu'il le soit. Lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur n'est pas au courant de l'existence d'une d\u00e9ficience et qu'aucun accommodement n'est demand\u00e9, l'obligation d'accommodement n'entre pas en jeu.\nDans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, je suis convaincu que le d\u00e9fendeur n'\u00e9tait pas au courant et que l'on ne pouvait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait au courant, de l'existence de la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 13 f\u00e9vrier 1995 \u00e0 avril 1998. Le d\u00e9fendeur n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 qu'un accommodement \u00e9tait exig\u00e9 et la preuve dont je suis saisi n'\u00e9taye pas que le d\u00e9fendeur pouvait soup\u00e7onner que le plaignant avait besoin d'un accommodement durant cette p\u00e9riode. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[110] La situation factuelle en l'esp\u00e8ce est, \u00e0 plusieurs \u00e9gards, diff\u00e9rente de l'affaire Gardiner. En l'esp\u00e8ce, compte tenu du contexte, j'ai conclu que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait au courant ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant de l'existence de la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante. Bien qu'aucune demande d'accommodement officielle ne fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avant le 22 octobre 2001, les diverses discussions que la plaignante a eues avec son superviseur et avec sa directrice, comme les notes \u00e9crites de ces derniers le font clairement ressortir, montrent que c'est ce qui \u00e9tait demand\u00e9.\n[111] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve concernant les efforts qu'il aurait d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en vue d'accommoder la plaignante. Le fait qu'il ait examin\u00e9 la description de t\u00e2ches de la plaignante et ait fait un ou deux appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pour trouver un emploi \u00e0 la plaignante ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un effort visant \u00e0 accommoder la plaignante sans subir de contraintes excessives. \u00c0 la suite de la demande d'accommodement officielle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante le 22 octobre 2001, l'intim\u00e9 aurait pu examiner avec elle si elle consentait \u00e0 ce qu'il discute du probl\u00e8me avec sa m\u00e9decin. Cela lui aurait permis de d\u00e9terminer quelles \u00e9taient les mesures d'accommodement dont elle avait besoin et de prendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e9clair\u00e9e quant \u00e0 savoir si ces mesures \u00e9taient raisonnables ou imposaient une contrainte excessive. Il a choisi de ne pas adopter cette ligne de conduite parce qu'il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une question de rendement. Il importe de se rappeler que le rendement et la d\u00e9ficience ne sont pas \u00e9trangers l'un \u00e0 l'autre, particuli\u00e8rement dans la mesure o\u00f9 la d\u00e9ficience peut avoir une incidence sur le rendement d'un employ\u00e9. Tous les probl\u00e8mes de rendement ne sont pas occasionn\u00e9s par une d\u00e9ficience, mais ceux qui le sont exigent d'ordinaire un certain degr\u00e9 d'accommodement.\n[112] Mme McIntyre a reconnu qu'elle savait que, dans le pass\u00e9, pour des raisons de sant\u00e9, la plaignante avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre mut\u00e9e dans un poste de niveau moins \u00e9lev\u00e9. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle disposait d'une possibilit\u00e9 dans la situation en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce, elle a r\u00e9pondu que cela n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 une [Traduction] bonne d\u00e9cision au point de vue de la gestion. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'adopter une telle ligne de conduite serait all\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre de la d\u00e9cision op\u00e9rationnelle qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise. Mme McIntyre a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle consid\u00e9rait la plaignante comme une employ\u00e9e embauch\u00e9e pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Nous ne modifions pas notre structure organisationnelle globale et nos d\u00e9cisions op\u00e9rationnelles lorsque nous pouvons essayer de trouver un emploi dans un autre bureau \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 de la situation de la plaignante avec un expert-conseil en dotation au bureau r\u00e9gional de l'intim\u00e9, la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de ne pas renouveler le 30 septembre, le contrat pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de la plaignante, sous r\u00e9serve d'une prolongation de 30 jours pour recherche d'emploi. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme McIntyre a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas bon pour la sant\u00e9 de la plaignante ainsi que pour les besoins op\u00e9rationnels de l'unit\u00e9 des travailleurs \u00e9trangers que le contrat soit renouvel\u00e9.\nVIII. CONCLUSION [113] Compte tenu de la situation factuelle et des principes juridiques applicables, je conclus que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison d'une d\u00e9ficience en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi. Des dates d'audience seront fix\u00e9es afin de traiter de la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats et de celle des autres r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es.\nMichel Doucet\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 25 janvier 2006\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T928\/4804\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Mary Mellon c.

ORDONNANCE\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le 23 novembre 2003, Richard Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne contre Craig Harrison. Dans sa plainte, M. Warman pr\u00e9tend que M. Harrison [traduction] commet un acte discriminatoire contre des personnes ou des groupes de personnes en raison de leur religion, leur race, leur couleur et leur origine nationale ou ethnique en diffusant de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e sur un site Web des messages qui sont susceptibles d'exposer les Italiens, les Mexicains, les Porto Ricains, les Ha\u00eftiens, les francophones, les Noirs, les autochtones, les personnes d'Asie de l'Est, les personnes qui ne sont pas de race blanche et les Juifs \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris, et ce, en contravention du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience de la plainte dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 et elle \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat.\nII. LE D\u00c9FAUT DE CRAIG HARRISON DE SE PR\u00c9SENTER ET D'ASSISTER \u00c0 L'AUDIENCE DANS SON INT\u00c9GRALIT\u00c9 [3] M. Harrison a assist\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de l'audience du 12 juin 2006. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par sa conjointe de fait, Susen Holmes. Moins de 90 minutes apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l'audience, alors que M. Warman \u00e9tait en train de t\u00e9moigner, M. Harrison s'est mis \u00e0 crier apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moin, obligeant ainsi le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner un ajournement. M. Harrison est ensuite sorti en coup de vent de la salle d'audience tout en prof\u00e9rant des obsc\u00e9nit\u00e9s contre M. Warman.\n[4] \u00c0 la reprise de l'audience, ni M. Harrison, ni Mme Holmes n'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents. J'ai donc ajourn\u00e9 l'audience jusqu'au 13 juin 2006 et j'ai ordonn\u00e9 qu'une lettre soit signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Harrison pour l'informer que l'audience reprendrait \u00e0 cette date et que s'il ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas, le Tribunal proc\u00e9derait en son absence.\n[5] Un affidavit sign\u00e9 par Paul Mitchell, un huissier de la ville de Brampton, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve. Dans son affidavit, M. Mitchell informait le Tribunal qu'il s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de M. Harrison \u00e0 Georgetown (Ontario), \u00e0 16 h 10, le 12 juin 2006, afin de lui signifier la lettre du Tribunal. Il n'a obtenu aucune r\u00e9ponse. Il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveau \u00e0 la m\u00eame adresse \u00e0 19 h 30, et, une fois de plus, il n'a obtenu aucune r\u00e9ponse. Il a affirm\u00e9 avoir entendu des voix provenant de l'int\u00e9rieur de la maison. Il a continu\u00e9 de frapper \u00e0 la porte, mais personne n'est venu r\u00e9pondre. Il a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la fente de la porte une enveloppe contenant une copie de la lettre du Tribunal. Cinq minutes plus tard, il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence et une femme affirmant s'appeler Susen Holmes a r\u00e9pondu et lui a dit qu'elle avait trouv\u00e9 la lettre et verrait \u00e0 ce que Craig Harrison la re\u00e7oive.\n[6] Le 13 juin 2006, Mme Holmes a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que M. Harrison ne participerait pas \u00e0 l'audience.\n[7] Le Tribunal est convaincu que M. Harrison et sa repr\u00e9sentante, Mme Holmes, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s que l'audience reprendrait le 13 juin 2006, \u00e0 9 h 30, et qu'ils ont choisi de ne pas y participer.\nIII. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [8] En ce qui concerne la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 13 par M. Warman, trois questions doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es pour savoir si la plainte est bien fond\u00e9e :\nM. Harrison a-t-il diffus\u00e9, ou fait diffuser, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, les messages figurant dans les divers sites Web en litige? Ces messages ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s, en tout ou en partie, en recourant aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement? Les questions abord\u00e9es dans les messages sont-elles susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite?\n[9] Si la plainte est bien fond\u00e9e, la question des mesures de redressement qu'il convient d'accorder devra \u00e9galement \u00eatre abord\u00e9e.\nIV. LA PLAINTE D\u00c9POS\u00c9E EN VERTU DE L'ARTICLE 13 A. L'approche g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [10] Le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6, (la Loi) est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n13. (1) It is a discriminatory practice for a person or a group of persons acting in concert to communicate telephonically or to cause to be so communicated, repeatedly, in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, any matter that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n13. (1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, d'utiliser ou de faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement pour aborder ou faire aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3.\n[11] Le paragraphe 13(2) de la Loi \u00e9tend l'application de la disposition susmentionn\u00e9e aux communications par Internet:\n(2) For greater certainty, subsection (1) applies in respect of a matter that is communicated by means of a computer or a group of interconnected or related computers, including the Internet, or any similar means of communication, but does not apply in respect of a matter that is communicated in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a broadcasting undertaking.\n(2) Il demeure entendu que le paragraphe (1) s'applique \u00e0 l'utilisation d'un ordinateur, d'un ensemble d'ordinateurs connect\u00e9s ou reli\u00e9s les uns aux autres, notamment d'Internet, ou de tout autre moyen de communication semblable mais qu'il ne s'applique pas dans les cas o\u00f9 les services d'une entreprise de radiodiffusion sont utilis\u00e9s.\n[12] La Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment con\u00e7ue afin de combattre les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et de favoriser la tol\u00e9rance et l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. L'objet de la loi est mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 2, lequel est ainsi libel\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\nl\u00e9 :\n[13] L'objet de la Loi, soit la promotion de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances ind\u00e9pendamment de consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur des motifs de distinction illicites, servira \u00e0 d\u00e9gager l'objet du paragraphe 13(1). En qualifiant d'acte discriminatoire l'activit\u00e9 d\u00e9crite au paragraphe 13(1), le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il tient pour contraire \u00e0 la promotion de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 les communications t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es susceptibles d'exposer des particuliers ou des groupes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris du fait qu'ils sont identifiables sur la base de certaines caract\u00e9ristiques (voir Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892).\n[14] Il est \u00e9galement important de se rappeler que l'intention d'\u00e9tablir une distinction n'est pas une condition pr\u00e9alable pour pouvoir conclure \u00e0 la discrimination (Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Simpson-Sears Ltd, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, pages 549 et 550; Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, pages 931 \u00e0 934).\n[15] Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kulbashian et autres, 2006 TCDP 11 (T.C.D.P.), le Tribunal affirme ce qui suit au paragraphe 59 :\n[L]e langage utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 13 est clair; ce sont les effets de la propagande qui ont retenu l'attention du l\u00e9gislateur. La question \u00e0 poser n'est pas celle de savoir si celui qui transmet le message a l'intention de communiquer de la haine ou du m\u00e9pris, mais celle de savoir si le message lui-m\u00eame est susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable. Si effectivement le contenu du bulletin d'information \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 exprimer une pr\u00e9tendue opinion politique, le message aurait pu \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 sans recourir au langage extr\u00e9miste et d\u00e9nigrant qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9pandu dans les diverses publications du bulletin d'information [...]\n[16] Dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy c. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, paragraphe 45697, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'utilisation du mot susceptible au paragraphe 13(1) signifie qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de produire une preuve qu'un individu ou un groupe particulier a pris les messages au s\u00e9rieux et a en fait dirig\u00e9 sa haine ou son m\u00e9pris contre des personnes, encore moins que quelqu'un est en fait devenu victime de tels actes. \u00c0 l'oppos\u00e9 des autres dispositions de la Loi portant sur la discrimination, le paragraphe 13(1) pr\u00e9voit la responsabilit\u00e9 lorsqu'il existe un effet discriminatoire non d\u00e9montr\u00e9 ou non d\u00e9montrable. Voici ce que le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 aux paragraphes 46 et 49 de la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Winnicki, 2006 TCDP 20 :\n[46] [...] Le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il n'existe aucun moyen facile d'acc\u00e8s pour \u00e9valuer le nombre de personnes expos\u00e9es aux messages ainsi que les r\u00e9percussions que ces derniers peuvent avoir eues sur ces personnes. Selon le Tribunal, ces consid\u00e9rations justifient l'extension de la responsabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 13(1) aux cas o\u00f9 il n'y a aucun effet discriminatoire r\u00e9el non prouv\u00e9 ou non prouvable.\n[49] [...] Selon le paragraphe 13(1), constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait de diffuser des messages qui sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable. La disposition ne mentionne pas que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait de diffuser des messages qui ont pour effet de susciter chez les autres de la haine et du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du groupe cible.\n[17] Les messages constituant de la propagande haineuse peuvent causer des pr\u00e9judices de deux mani\u00e8res importantes. Premi\u00e8rement, ils portent atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'estime de soi des membres du groupe cible et, deuxi\u00e8mement, ils minent la tol\u00e9rance et l'ouverture d'esprit qui doivent fleurir dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 multiculturelle vou\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 (Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 50.). Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver l'existence d'un pr\u00e9judice.\n[18] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 30 de la d\u00e9cision Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Winnicki, 2005 CF 1493 :\nLe pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 aux groupes cibl\u00e9s par les messages haineux est tr\u00e8s souvent difficile \u00e0 r\u00e9parer. Il renforce de mani\u00e8re insidieuse les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s qu'ont certains envers les minorit\u00e9s identifi\u00e9es par la race, la couleur et la religion, incitant et justifiant par le fait m\u00eame le recours aux pratiques discriminatoires, voire \u00e0 la violence, contre ces groupes. En m\u00eame temps, ces messages sont tr\u00e8s susceptibles d'influencer la perception et l'estime de soi de tous les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s, les emp\u00eachant ainsi de participer pleinement \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne et de r\u00e9aliser leur plein potentiel comme \u00eatres humains.\n[19] Comment \u00e9value-t-on si un acte est susceptible de causer un pr\u00e9judice? Dans la d\u00e9cision Citron c. Z\u00fcndel, (no 4) (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/274, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve le plus convaincant est le langage utilis\u00e9 dans les messages proprement dits. Point n'est besoin d'un t\u00e9moignage d'expert sur cette question, bien que, dans certain cas, il pourrait \u00eatre utile.\n[20] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments doivent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9s selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s afin d'\u00e9tablir qu'il y a eu violation de l'article 13 :\nL'intim\u00e9 a-t-il diffus\u00e9, ou fait diffuser, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, les messages qui font l'objet de la plainte? Ces messages ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s, en tout ou en partie, en recourant aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement? Les questions abord\u00e9es dans les messages sont-elles susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite?\nB. M. Harrison a-t-il diffus\u00e9, ou fait diffuser, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, les messages figurant dans les divers sites Web en litige? [21] L'int\u00e9r\u00eat manifest\u00e9 par M. Warman pour le monde des groupes haineux et de la propagande haineuse a pris naissance il y a environ 15 ans alors qu'il commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 surveiller les activit\u00e9s de diverses personnes bien connues dans les groupes pr\u00f4nant la supr\u00e9matie des Blancs et dans les groupes n\u00e9o-nazis. Il y a cinq ou six ans, avec l'arriv\u00e9e d'Internet, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'int\u00e9resser \u00e0 l'utilisation qu'en faisaient ces groupes ainsi que les personnes qui faisaient la promotion d'id\u00e9es semblables dans le but de diffuser de la propagande haineuse.\n[22] La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman a trait \u00e0 des messages affich\u00e9s sur diff\u00e9rents sites Web. L'un de ces sites Web s'appelle Freedomsite. Ce site est d\u00e9crit par M. Warman comme \u00e9tant [traduction] un rassemblement de groupes pr\u00f4nant la supr\u00e9matie des Blancs et de groupes n\u00e9o-nazis. Selon le plaignant, la premi\u00e8re page du babillard \u00e9lectronique de ce site Web comprend une liste de Conf\u00e9rences dans laquelle figurent des titres comme Immigration, Religion, Ennemis de la libert\u00e9 et Blagues et Questions anecdotiques. Sous ces titres, figurent des fils de discussion. Ces fils de discussion sont des sous-cat\u00e9gories des titres g\u00e9n\u00e9raux figurant sous la rubrique Conf\u00e9rences.\n[23] M. Warman d\u00e9clare avoir visit\u00e9 \u00e0 diverses reprises le site Freedomsite ainsi que son babillard \u00e9lectronique et que lors de ces visites il a d\u00e9couvert que 71 messages avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s entre le 13 mai 2002 et le 21 janvier 2003 par une personne utilisant les noms d'utilisateur realcanadianson et rump. Pour \u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cis, les messages figurant sous le nom d'utilisateur realcanadianson ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s durant cinq jours entre le 13 et le 21 mai 2002; les messages utilisant le nom d'utilisateur rump sont apparues le 13 novembre 2002 ainsi que le 19 et le 21 janvier 2003. Enfin, comme nous le verrons plus loin, d'autres messages figurant sous le nom d'utilisateur realnorthamerican ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s entre le 24 et le 27 janvier 2004, puis de nouveau entre le 2 et le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2004, sur un autre site Web.\n[24] Au cours de sa recherche, M. Warman a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9couvrir l'identit\u00e9 de cette personne. Il a remarqu\u00e9 que dans tous les messages affich\u00e9s sous le nom d'utilisateur realcanadianson figurait l'adresse \u00e9lectronique susen@sympatico.ca. Selon les renseignements figurant sur le compte Bell Sympatico, cette adresse \u00e9lectronique est celle de Susen Holmes dont l'adresse de r\u00e9sidence est la m\u00eame que celle de Craig Harrison, l'intim\u00e9, \u00e0 Georgetown (Ontario).\n[25] De plus, quant \u00e0 la question de l'identit\u00e9, une copie papier d'une page du site Freedomsite, comportait le message suivant affich\u00e9 par realcanadianson susen@sympatico.ca en mai 2002 : [traduction] j'ai pass\u00e9 deux ann\u00e9es en prison pour avoir frapp\u00e9 un chintok de n\u00e8gre en 96. Dans un autre message affich\u00e9 le 14 mai 2002, toujours par realcanadianson susen@sympatico.ca, on peut lire ce qui suit : [traduction] tu es mon h\u00e9ros. j'ai pris deux ans de t\u00f4le en 96 parce que j'ai battu un agresseur d'enfants m\u00e9tis \u00e0 Georgetown (Ontario). \u00e9h, je suis un h\u00e9ros moi aussi Toujours le m\u00eame jour, un autre message affich\u00e9 par realcanadianson susen@sympatico.ca mentionne ce qui suit : [traduction] j'ai pass\u00e9 deux ann\u00e9es en prison parce que j'ai frapp\u00e9 un sale n\u00e8gre \u00e0 Georgetown. je suis un authentique h\u00e9ros canadien comme mes grands-p\u00e8res qui sont all\u00e9s \u00e0 la guerre. devinez quoi? les fran\u00e7ais n'ont pas combattu durant les guerres parce qu'ils sont l\u00e2ches et ils devraient \u00eatre jet\u00e9s \u00e0 la mer. Le 16 mai 2002, la m\u00eame personne, utilisant le m\u00eame nom d'utilisateur et la m\u00eame adresse \u00e9lectronique, a affich\u00e9 le message suivant : [traduction] tu te souviens de moi skin head? je suis le type de Georgetown qui a pris deux ans pour avoir frapp\u00e9 ce n\u00e8gre sur la rue principale. reviens bient\u00f4t. on a besoin de toi ici pour la cause. que dieu te b\u00e9nisse et sois prudent.\n[26] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, en 1996, M. Harrison a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de voies de fait ayant caus\u00e9 des l\u00e9sions corporelles et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une peine d'emprisonnement de deux ans moins un jour. L'agression s'est produite \u00e0 Georgetown (Ontario).\n[27] Un article de journal, dat\u00e9 du 29 mai 1996, tir\u00e9 du Georgetown Independent et intitul\u00e9 Un propri\u00e9taire de magasin est victime d'une brutale agression, d\u00e9crit une agression qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise sur un propri\u00e9taire d'entreprise d'origine sino-africaine devant son magasin situ\u00e9 sur la rue principale \u00e0 Georgetown. L'article ajoute que la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9e de l'agression \u00e9tait un certain Craig Harrison. L'article pr\u00e9cise que la victime se trouvait devant son magasin lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 accost\u00e9e par un jeune homme de race blanche qui prof\u00e9rait des insultes racistes, puis qui l'a projet\u00e9e sur le sol et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui donner des coups de poing et des coups de pied.\n[28] Lors de sa br\u00e8ve comparution devant le Tribunal, M. Harrison n'a pas ni\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 quant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits dans l'article. Au contraire, alors que M. Warman \u00e9tait en train de t\u00e9moigner concernant cet incident, M. Harrison s'est offusqu\u00e9 du fait que celui-ci ait qualifi\u00e9 l'attaque d'attaque motiv\u00e9e par le racisme. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 crier ce qui suit : [traduction] Ce n'\u00e9tait pas raciste [...] Il n'y avait rien de raciste dans \u00e7a. Vous avez compris? C'est bien. Allons (s'adressant \u00e0 Susen Holmes) fumer une cigarette. Ce type est un con. M. Harrison a \u00e9galement utilis\u00e9 d'autres expressions m\u00e9prisantes, lesquelles n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es. Cette attitude ainsi que la r\u00e9action agressive de M. Harrison me confirment qu'il est bien la personne dont parlait l'article de journal.\n[29] Les documents de la Cour qui font mention de cet incident ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve. Ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9s par la cour criminelle de la r\u00e9gion du Centre-Ouest. Ils font \u00e9tat des accusations port\u00e9es contre M. Harrison relativement \u00e0 l'agression commise \u00e0 Georgetown. L'adresse de M. Harrison qui figure dans ces documents est exactement la m\u00eame que celle qui figure dans les dossiers du Tribunal et la m\u00eame que celle o\u00f9 l'huissier a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 la lettre du Tribunal le 12 juin 2006.\n[30] M. Warman a de plus affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, apr\u00e8s avoir vu l'adresse \u00e9lectronique susen@sympatico.ca dans les divers messages affich\u00e9s sous le pseudonyme realcanadianson, il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 facile de faire une recherche quant \u00e0 cette adresse \u00e9lectronique. Au cours de cette recherche, M. Warman a d\u00e9couvert un message, dat\u00e9 du 4 d\u00e9cembre 2002, affich\u00e9 dans le livre des visiteurs d'un autre site Web h\u00e9berg\u00e9 par Canadian Heritage Alliance, dans lequel Craig Harrison s'est identifi\u00e9 par son nom. Il avait alors mentionn\u00e9 que son adresse \u00e9lectronique \u00e9tait susen@sympatico.ca et qu'il vivait \u00e0 Georgetown (Ontario), Dominion du Canada.\n[31] Les recherches de M. Warman lui ont \u00e9galement permis de d\u00e9couvrir un certain nombre de messages affich\u00e9s sous le nom d'utilisateur rump. Ces messages sont \u00e9crits dans un style tr\u00e8s semblable \u00e0 celui des messages affich\u00e9s par realcanadianson. Ils \u00e9taient tous \u00e9crits en lettres minuscules, poss\u00e9daient le m\u00eame genre de ponctuation et, fondamentalement, traitaient des m\u00eames sujets quant aux cibles des attaques. Un message en particulier, dat\u00e9 du 13 novembre 2002, \u00e9tait sign\u00e9 c s h a real canadian (c s h un v\u00e9ritable canadien). Selon M. Warman, l'importance de cette signature aux fins de l'identit\u00e9 est que le nom complet de M. Harrison, tel qu'il figure dans les documents judiciaires, est Craig Steven Harrison (initiales C.S.H.).\n[32] De plus, dans un certain nombre de messages affich\u00e9s sous le nom d'utilisateur rump, l'auteur mentionne le nom de Georgetown comme \u00e9tant celui de sa ville natale.\n[33] Un affidavit sign\u00e9 par Hannya Rizk, une enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, dat\u00e9 du 8 juin 2006, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve par la Commission. L'intim\u00e9, qui \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait toujours pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l'audience, n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune objection quant au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de cet affidavit et il n'a pas non plus demand\u00e9 \u00e0 contre-interroger son auteur.\n[34] Dans le rapport de l'enqu\u00eatrice annex\u00e9 \u00e0 son affidavit, Mme Rizk a mentionn\u00e9 que le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2004, M. Harrison a appel\u00e9 la Commission et \u00e0 fait part de sa d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'encontre de la plainte. Mme Rizk lui a demand\u00e9 s'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 visit\u00e9 le site Web Freedomsite. Il a r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait tent\u00e9 de le visiter, la journ\u00e9e m\u00eame, mais qu'il n'avait pas pu y avoir acc\u00e8s parce qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9. Mme Rizk lui a ensuite demand\u00e9 s'il avait visit\u00e9 le site avant le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2004 et il a r\u00e9pondu que c'\u00e9tait possible. Mme Rizk lui a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 s'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 affich\u00e9 des messages sur ce site Web et il a r\u00e9pondu que c'\u00e9tait possible.\n[35] Mme Rizk a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Harrison s'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 utilis\u00e9 les pseudonymes realcanadianson et rump. Il a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative et a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne poss\u00e9dait pas d'adresse \u00e9lectronique mais qu'il se servait \u00e0 l'occasion de l'adresse \u00e9lectronique de son amie Susen Holmes. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que cette adresse \u00e9tait susen@sympatico.ca.\n[36] Durant l'audience, la Commission a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve un affidavit sign\u00e9 par Marc Lemire, le webmestre du site Web Freedomsite.org, dans lequel, jusqu'en janvier 2004, figurait le babillard \u00e9lectronique o\u00f9 se trouvaient les messages affich\u00e9s sous les noms d'utilisateur realcanadianson et rump. M. Lemire a expliqu\u00e9 dans son affidavit que pour s'inscrire sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique, une personne devait fournir son nom et son pr\u00e9nom, son nom d'utilisateur ainsi que son adresse \u00e9lectronique. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'on ne faisait aucune v\u00e9rification quant au nom, pr\u00e9nom ou nom d'utilisateur. On ne faisait que v\u00e9rifier la validit\u00e9 de l'adresse \u00e9lectronique fournie. Lorsqu'une personne ouvrait un nouveau compte, un mot de passe \u00e9tait envoy\u00e9 par courriel \u00e0 l'adresse \u00e9lectronique que la personne avait fournie.\n[37] M. Lemire a joint \u00e0 son affidavit les profils d'utilisateur pour les noms d'utilisateur realcanadianson et rump. Le nom de la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni pour le nom d'utilisateur realcanadianson \u00e9tait Craig Harrison. Le lieu de r\u00e9sidence qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni \u00e9tait Georgetown (Ontario) et l'adresse \u00e9lectronique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni \u00e9tait susen@sympatico.ca. Le nom de la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni pour le nom d'utilisateur rump \u00e9tait Lomp Pomp et le lieu de r\u00e9sidence qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni \u00e9tait Yukom, Ontario polop2. Il est \u00e9vident qu'il s'agit de noms fictifs. L'adresse \u00e9lectronique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie est la m\u00eame que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie pour realcanadianson, c'est-\u00e0-dire susen@sympatico.ca.\n[38] M. Warman pr\u00e9tend de plus que M. Harrison a affich\u00e9 d'autres messages sur un autre site Web figurant \u00e0 l'adresse www.ypenterprise.net. Ce site comprend un forum de discussion appel\u00e9 Yoderanium. Cette fois, le nom d'utilisateur utilis\u00e9 est realnorthamerican. Il existe de nombreuses similarit\u00e9s entre le style utilis\u00e9 et les sujets abord\u00e9s par realnorthamerican et le style utilis\u00e9 et les sujets abord\u00e9s par realcanadianson et rump. La qualification des Canadiens fran\u00e7ais comme \u00e9tant des l\u00e2ches et des conscrits r\u00e9fractaires est un th\u00e8me constamment repris dans tous les messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s. De plus, les attaques dirig\u00e9es contre les personnes d'origine n\u00e9erlandaise, contre la vague d'immigration qui a suivi la Seconde Guerre mondiale et les allusions faites \u00e0 l'ancien premier ministre Trudeau sont des caract\u00e9ristiques tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8res des messages. Bien que la preuve concernant le nom d'utilisateur realnorthamerican soit circonstancielle, elle suffit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie que realnorthamerican est un autre nom d'utilisateur dont se sert M. Harrison.\n[39] Le plaignant et la Commission ont le fardeau ultime d'\u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de leur cause selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. D\u00e8s qu'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication raisonnable d\u00e9montrant qu'il n'est pas l'auteur des messages offensants, que le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 acte discriminatoire ne s'est jamais produit ou que, d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre, sa conduite n'\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire.\n[40] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte, M. Harrison et sa repr\u00e9sentante, Susen Holmes, ont affirm\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 \u00e0 tort et que, en fait, \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode pertinente, ils ne poss\u00e9daient pas d'ordinateur ou qu'une autre personne s'\u00e9tait servie de leur ordinateur et avait affich\u00e9 les messages. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 qu'ils avaient h\u00e2te de pr\u00e9senter leurs versions des faits. Ils ont fait un autre choix et ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'ils ne participeraient pas \u00e0 l'audience et qu'ils ne pr\u00e9senteraient aucune preuve \u00e0 l'appui de leurs explications. Le Tribunal ne peut pas prendre acte de simples insinuations lanc\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte, si, en bout de ligne, aucune preuve n'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e afin d'\u00e9tayer ces insinuations.\n[41] Le Tribunal inf\u00e8re de la d\u00e9cision de M. Harrison de ne pas t\u00e9moigner ou de ne pas se soumettre \u00e0 un contre-interrogatoire que son t\u00e9moignage aurait pu lui causer pr\u00e9judice. Dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy c. Johnston, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 45628 :\nComme Sopinka et Lederman (supra) le d\u00e9clarent :\nOn peut conclure \u00e0 l'encontre d'un d\u00e9fendeur si celui-ci refuse de t\u00e9moigner [...] une fois qu'on a \u00e9tabli un juste motif d'action contre lui. (p. 537)\nLes auteurs ajoutent \u00e9galement ce qui suit : Une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9favorable est \u00e9galement justifi\u00e9e lorsqu'une partie au litige ne t\u00e9moigne pas ni n'appelle de t\u00e9moin qui aurait pu conna\u00eetre les faits et rendre un t\u00e9moignage favorable important si son argument avait \u00e9t\u00e9 valable. (p. 145)\n[42] En l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Harrison n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et n'a appel\u00e9 personne \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par le plaignant que M. Harrison a affich\u00e9 ces messages et, dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, il convient que le Tribunal tire une conclusion d\u00e9favorable du fait que l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de n'offrir aucune r\u00e9ponse.\n[43] En me fondant sur la preuve qui m'est soumise, je conclus que Craig Harrison est l'auteur des messages affich\u00e9s sur le site Freedomsite et de ceux affich\u00e9s dans le groupe de discussion Yoderanium sous les noms d'utilisateur realcanadianson, rump et realamericanson.\n[44] En ce qui concerne l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Schnell, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 129, que l'utilisation des mots de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e au paragraphe 13(1) donne \u00e0 penser que ce paragraphe vise, non pas les communications priv\u00e9es avec des amis, mais plut\u00f4t une s\u00e9rie de messages qui repr\u00e9sentent un plan public de grande \u00e9chelle pour la diffusion de certaines id\u00e9es ou opinions, con\u00e7ues pour convertir des membres du public (voir Warman c. Winnicki, 2006 TCDP 20, par. 36). Selon moi, les messages Internet \u00e9chang\u00e9s sur un site Web accessible \u00e0 tout le monde ne sont pas des communications priv\u00e9es. Je souligne que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Warman n'a eu aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se rendre en surfant sur les sites Web o\u00f9 ces messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s. Comme ces messages pouvaient \u00eatre consult\u00e9s en tout temps par toute personne qui utilisait Internet, on peut affirmer qu'ils \u00e9taient transmis de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e.\n[45] Le fait qu'un site Web soit un m\u00e9dium relativement passif qui exige que le lecteur pose des gestes concrets pour avoir acc\u00e8s au mat\u00e9riel qui y est publi\u00e9 ne change rien au fait qu'en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeant les messages vers les sites Web, M. Harrison a diffus\u00e9 le mat\u00e9riel en litige (voir Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc, 43 C.H.R.R. d\/453, par. 127; Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18, par. 9).\n[46] De plus, en utilisant Internet, l'effet lent et pernicieux de commentaires intol\u00e9rants relativement isol\u00e9s pour reprendre les mots utilis\u00e9s dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canadian Liberty Net, [1998] 1 R.C.S. 626, paragraphe 48, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait question d'utilisation du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, s'est maintenant transform\u00e9 en une forme de communication ayant une large diffusion. Les messages affich\u00e9s dans Internet sont plus facilement accessibles et sont plus envahissants que les moyens de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication ant\u00e9rieurs. Le contenu d'un site Web peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre facilement reproduit \u00e0 l'infini sans que le cr\u00e9ateur ne puisse faire quoi que ce soit (Barrick Gold Corp. c. Lopehandia, [2004] O.J. no 2329).\n[47] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que le plaignant et la Commission ont \u00e9tabli une cause prima facie que Craig Harrison a diffus\u00e9, ou fait diffuser, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, les messages qui figurent dans les sites Web en litige.\nC. Ces messages ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s, en tout ou en partie, en recourant aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement? [48] La preuve de fonds contre M. Harrison est principalement compos\u00e9e de copies de messages affich\u00e9s dans Internet.\n[49] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 l'origine, ne traitait pas explicitement des communications Internet. Dans le cadre des modifications apport\u00e9es au droit canadien par la proclamation, le 24 d\u00e9cembre 2001, de la Loi antiterroriste, L.C. 2001, ch. 41, article 88, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par l'ajout du paragraphe 13(2), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, lequel traite express\u00e9ment des communications Internet.\n[50] Comme l'ensemble des messages qui constituent le fondement de la pr\u00e9sente plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s apr\u00e8s l'adoption du paragraphe 13(2), il ne fait aucun doute qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s, en tout ou en partie, en recourant aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement. M\u00eame si cela n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas, nous devons nous souvenir que dans Citron et al c. Z\u00fcndel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et dans Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc. et al, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, on a conclu que l'article 13 englobe les communications Internet.\nD. Les questions abord\u00e9es dans les messages sont-elles susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite? (i) Quelles sont les questions abord\u00e9es dans les messages diffus\u00e9s par M. Harrison? [51] Dans sa plainte, M. Warman pr\u00e9tend que M. Harrison a affich\u00e9 des messages qui sont susceptibles d'exposer les Italiens, les Mexicains, les Porto Ricains, les Ha\u00eftiens, les francophones, les Noirs, les autochtones, les personnes d'Asie de l'Est, les personnes qui ne sont pas de race blanche et les Juifs \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris du fait de leur religion, de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, de leur race ou de leur couleur.\n[52] Bien que les mots utilis\u00e9s soient tr\u00e8s offensants et tr\u00e8s d\u00e9gradants, et c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire, j'estime qu'il est pertinent au regard des questions \u00e0 trancher de citer des extraits de certains de ces messages.

Certains des messages susmentionn\u00e9s comportent peut-\u00eatre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui peuvent faire l'objet d'un d\u00e9bat politique l\u00e9gitime, bien que je n'en voie pas, et personne ne peut nier le fait que l'intim\u00e9 a droit \u00e0 ses opinions politiques. Mais, il est \u00e9galement clair que la majorit\u00e9 de ces messages d\u00e9passent les param\u00e8tres juridiques du d\u00e9bat public et contreviennent aux dispositions de la Loi. L'appel \u00e0 la violence contre les autochtones, les francophones, les Noirs et les autres personnes qui ne sont pas de race blanche, ainsi que les attaques dirig\u00e9es contre d'autres groupes et d'autres personnes en raison de leur religion, leur couleur, leur origine nationale ou ethnique, en utilisant des propos racistes et des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes d\u00e9gradants, ne constituent pas un d\u00e9bat politique l\u00e9gitime. Ils incitent \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris.\n[54] Les sujets abord\u00e9s dans les messages traitent essentiellement de l'\u00e9limination des personnes qui ne sont pas de race blanche ainsi que des autres collectivit\u00e9s vis\u00e9es comme les Canadiens fran\u00e7ais, les Noirs et les Juifs. Les messages exhortent les Blancs \u00e0 tuer parce que, selon leur auteur, [traduction] dieu leur a ordonn\u00e9 de le faire ou parce que [traduction] dieu a donn\u00e9 le Canada \u00e0 l'homme blanc. Les messages attaquent d'une mani\u00e8re humiliante les membres de diverses collectivit\u00e9s culturelles et religieuses. On per\u00e7oit dans ces messages une haine obsessionnelle des autochtones, des francophones et, du reste, de toutes les collectivit\u00e9s qui ne sont pas de race blanche, de religion chr\u00e9tienne ou de descendance anglaise.\n(ii) Les messages sont-ils susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite? [55] Dans le but de traiter cette question, les mots exposer, haine et m\u00e9pris doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s. Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, ainsi que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ont eu l'occasion de se pencher sur les significations de ces mots dans des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures.\n[56] Les mots haine et m\u00e9pris ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s par les cours de justice dans des causes ant\u00e9rieures portant sur l'article 13. Dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a cit\u00e9 avec approbation les d\u00e9finitions de ces mots figurant dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy c. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, paragraphe 6469 (T.C.D.P.). Dans l'arr\u00eat Nealy, le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nComme la [Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne] ne contient aucune d\u00e9finition des termes hatred ou contempt, il faut s'appuyer sur leur sens ordinaire. De toute \u00e9vidence, ils peuvent \u00eatre charg\u00e9s \u00e9motivement, et la fa\u00e7on dont ils sont utilis\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 des situations de fait particuli\u00e8res par diff\u00e9rents individus ne sera pas toujours la m\u00eame. N\u00e9anmoins, il existe un tronc commun important aux deux que les d\u00e9finitions du dictionnaire refl\u00e8tent. Le terme hatred connote un ensemble d'\u00e9motions et de sentiments comportant une malice extr\u00eame envers une autre personne ou un autre groupe de personnes. Quand on dit qu'on hait quelqu'un, c'est que l'on ne trouve aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te ses d\u00e9fauts. Toutefois, il s'agit d'un terme qui ne fait pas appel n\u00e9cessairement au processus mental de regarder quelqu'un de haut. Il est fort possible de ha\u00efr quelqu'un que l'on estime sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 soi en intelligence, en richesse ou en pouvoir. Aucun des synonymes utilis\u00e9s dans le dictionnaire pour le terme hatred ne donne d'indice sur les motifs de la malice. Par contraste, contempt est un terme qui sugg\u00e8re le processus mental consistant \u00e0 regarder quelqu'un de haut ou \u00e0 le traiter comme inf\u00e9rieur.\n[57] Dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy, le Tribunal s'est \u00e9galement pench\u00e9 sur la signification du mot exposer tel qu'il est employ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 13 :\nOn ne trouve pas habituellement le verbe exposer dans les lois destin\u00e9es \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la propagande haineuse. Par contre, il est dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas question, par exemple dans le R\u00e8glement d\u00e9coulant de la Loi sur la radiodiffusion, dans les dispositions de la Loi sur les postes et dans divers articles connexes du Code criminel, de propos insultants ou injurieux, ou de d\u00e9clarations qui incitent \u00e0 la haine ou la fomentent.\nLe verbe inciter veut dire attiser; fomenter signifie soutenir activement. Le verbe exposer est un terme plus passif, qui semble indiquer que la personne qui transmet le message n'a pas l'intention de susciter une r\u00e9action violente chez la personne qui le re\u00e7oit. Exposer \u00e0 la haine implique \u00e9galement un genre de communication plus subtile et indirecte que l'insulte vulgaire ou le langage injurieux non d\u00e9guis\u00e9. Le verbe exposer signifie : laisser une personne ou une chose sans protection; laisser sans abri ou d\u00e9fense; soumettre au danger, au ridicule, \u00e0 la censure, etc. En d'autres termes, si un individu cr\u00e9e les conditions propices \u00e0 la haine, laisse le groupe identifiable expos\u00e9 \u00e0 la rancune ou \u00e0 l'hostilit\u00e9, s'il le place dans une situation o\u00f9 il risque d'\u00eatre ha\u00ef, ou l\u00e0 o\u00f9 la haine ou le m\u00e9pris sont in\u00e9vitables, alors cet individu tombe sous le coup du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi sur les droits de la personne.\n(voir \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Schnell, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux par. 85 \u00e0 89)\n[58] Selon moi, il ne fait aucun doute que ces messages sont susceptibles d'exposer des personnes qui ne sont pas chr\u00e9tiennes, de race blanche et de descendance anglaise, \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. Ces personnes sont expos\u00e9es au ridicule, au ressentiment, \u00e0 l'hostilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la violence, ce qui cr\u00e9e un climat favorable au d\u00e9veloppement de la haine ou du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard.\n[59] Le pr\u00e9tendu humour que l'on retrouve dans les messages sous le titre Blagues expose incontestablement les groupes vis\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. Ces blagues traitent manifestement les Juifs et les autochtones avec m\u00e9pris et avec condescendance. Elles portent atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et sont m\u00e9prisantes. D'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les messages servent \u00e0 d\u00e9shumaniser les personnes qui appartiennent aux groupes vis\u00e9s. L'utilisation d'insultes racistes et de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes d\u00e9gradants est malveillante, insultante, offensante et, en soi, elle fait preuve de haine et de m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des groupes vis\u00e9s. L'appel \u00e0 la violence contre les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s r\u00e9v\u00e8le des sentiments d'extr\u00eame malice.\n[60] L'extr\u00eame malice et l'extr\u00eame malveillance de l'auteur \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des groupes vis\u00e9s sont pr\u00e9sentes dans tous les messages. Des d\u00e9clarations exhortant \u00e0 la violence et au meurtre donnent \u00e0 penser que les victimes n'ont aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te leurs d\u00e9fauts, et, de ce fait, les d\u00e9shumanisent. Ces propos exposent incontestablement les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine, au m\u00e9pris et \u00e0 un v\u00e9ritable danger physique en donnant \u00e0 penser qu'ils sont des cibles l\u00e9gitimes de violence aveugle. Les messages servent \u00e0 engendrer et \u00e0 encourager l'envie, la m\u00e9fiance ou le ressentiment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes et des groupes vis\u00e9s, ce qui, \u00e0 leur tour, engendrent la haine contre eux.\n[61] Pour l'ensemble de ces motifs, je conclus que les messages sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite.\nE. Conclusion quant \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 13 [62] L'article 19 de la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l'homme pr\u00e9voit que tout individu a le droit de ne pas \u00eatre inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 pour ses opinions et celui de chercher, de recevoir et de r\u00e9pandre [...] les informations et les id\u00e9es par quelque moyen d'expression que ce soit. Ce droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'opinion et d'expression constitue la pierre angulaire d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique et c'est un droit auquel les Canadiens sont tr\u00e8s attach\u00e9s. Il est \u00e9galement reconnu dans la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[63] Dans l'arr\u00eat Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a eu l'occasion d'examiner attentivement la port\u00e9e de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne au regard de la garantie fondamentale de libert\u00e9 d'opinion et d'expression prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le droit international et la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s. La Cour a conclu que bien que l'article 13 viole le droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'opinion et d'expression, cette violation \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e compte tenu de l'engagement international du Canada envers l'\u00e9limination de la propagande haineuse ainsi que de son engagement envers les valeurs de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 et du multiculturalisme\n[64] Comme le Tribunal l'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9, les valeurs qui sous-tendent la propagande haineuse sont fondamentalement hostiles, pour ne pas dire antith\u00e9tiques, \u00e0 la justification sous-jacente \u00e0 la protection de la libert\u00e9 d'expression et elles contredisent directement d'autres valeurs \u00e9galement consacr\u00e9es par la Charte canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Winnicki, 2005 CF 1493, par. 29).\n[65] Je crois qu'il est juste d'affirmer que les messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur les sites Web susmentionn\u00e9s et dont j'ai reproduit des extraits dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, sont susceptibles d'exposer les Juifs, les autochtones, les francophones, les Noirs et d'autres personnes, \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris. Ces messages sont indubitablement aussi ignobles qu'on peut l'imaginer et sont non seulement discriminatoires mais \u00e9galement mena\u00e7ants \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des victimes qu'ils visent.\n[66] Ayant conclu que Craig Harrison a diffus\u00e9, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, en recourant aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement, des messages susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite, je conclus que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman en vertu de l'article 13 est fond\u00e9e.\nV. LES MESURES DE REDRESSEMENT [67] Ayant \u00e9tabli le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman en vertu de l'article 13, la derni\u00e8re question qu'il reste \u00e0 trancher est celle des mesures de redressement.\nA. Ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir [68] Lorsque le bien-fond\u00e9 d'une plainte tombant sous le coup de l'article 13 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) de la Loi habilite le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables. Le processus consistant \u00e0 entendre une plainte port\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) et, si la plainte est fond\u00e9e, \u00e0 rendre une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir, rappelle aux Canadiens notre engagement fondamental envers l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances et l'\u00e9limination de l'intol\u00e9rance raciale et religieuse.\n[69] Une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir appelle l'attention de l'intim\u00e9 sur le fait que ses messages sont susceptibles d'avoir un effet pr\u00e9judiciable. L'incertitude ou l'erreur quant \u00e0 l'effet probable des messages est donc dissip\u00e9e et si l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 continue \u00e0 les diffuser c'est en sachant que certaines personnes ou certains groupes sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris en raison de la race ou de la religion.\n[70] Les messages affich\u00e9s par les personnes sur divers site Web posent un d\u00e9fi particulier au Tribunal lorsqu'il s'agit de concevoir une mesure de redressement efficace. Comme le Tribunal l'a affirm\u00e9 au paragraphe 81 de la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e : La nature unique de la technologie Internet, y compris les difficult\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'existence de multiples juridictions du fait que le cyberespace n'a pas de fronti\u00e8res, ainsi que la mobilit\u00e9 des cibles en raison du recours \u00e0 des sites miroirs, soul\u00e8vent des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes quant \u00e0 l'efficacit\u00e9 des ordonnances de cesser et de s'abstenir de diffuser des messages haineux par Internet.\n[71] Malgr\u00e9 ces d\u00e9fis, j'adopte les propos tenus par le Tribunal au paragraphe 300 de la d\u00e9cision Z\u00fcndel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e :\nToute mesure de redressement prise par ce Tribunal ou tout autre tribunal servira immanquablement plusieurs buts; la pr\u00e9vention et l'\u00e9limination d'actes discriminatoires ne sont qu'un des r\u00e9sultats qui d\u00e9couleront d'une ordonnance rendue par suite de cette instance. La d\u00e9nonciation publique des actes reproch\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce rev\u00eat par ailleurs une importante valeur symbolique. De plus, il y a un avantage possible sur le plan \u00e9ducatif et, en fin de compte, du point de vue de l'effet pr\u00e9ventif qui peut d\u00e9couler d'un d\u00e9bat ouvert sur les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans cette d\u00e9cision et toute autre d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\n[72] Par cons\u00e9quent, une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir peut avoir \u00e0 la fois un effet pratique et \u00e0 la fois un effet symbolique. Quant \u00e0 l'effet pratique, elle emp\u00eachera l'intim\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 diffuser des messages du genre d\u00e9crit dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. La d\u00e9nonciation publique des actes reproch\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce rev\u00eat par ailleurs une importante valeur symbolique.\n[73] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne que Craig Harrison ou toute autre personne agissant d'un commun accord avec Craig Harrison, mette fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire qui consiste \u00e0 utiliser ou de faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement, pour diffuser des messages du genre de ceux pour lesquels on a conclu en l'esp\u00e8ce qu'ils violaient le paragraphe 13(1), ou des messages fondamentalement semblables, susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite, et ce, en contravention de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Par souci de clart\u00e9, le Tribunal ordonne que Craig Harrison cesse et s'abstienne d'afficher dans Internet tout message de cette nature d\u00e8s que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal lui aura \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise.\nB. Sanction p\u00e9cuniaire [74] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) de la Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e, dans le cas d'une plainte tombant sous le coup de l'article 13, de verser en guise de sanction p\u00e9cuniaire une somme pouvant atteindre 10 000 $. Comme l'a mentionn\u00e9 le Tribunal au paragraphe 92 de la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e : L'inclusion de cette disposition dans les modifications de 1998 \u00e0 la Loi repr\u00e9sente une rupture importante par rapport \u00e0 l'approche traditionnelle voulant que les d\u00e9dommagements dans les affaires de droits de la personne visent d'abord et avant tout \u00e0 redresser plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 punir..\n[75] Avant de d\u00e9cider s'il y a lieu d'imposer en l'esp\u00e8ce une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire \u00e0 M. Harrison, le l\u00e9gislateur a ordonn\u00e9 que le Tribunal tienne compte de plusieurs facteurs. Le paragraphe 54(1.1) est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n(1.1) In deciding whether to order the person to pay the penalty, the member or panel shall take into account the following factors:\nthe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice; and the wilfulness or intent of the person who engaged in the discriminatory practice, any prior discriminatory practices that the person has engaged in and the person's ability to pay the penalty.\n(1.1) Il tient compte, avant d'imposer la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a (1)c) :\nde la nature et de la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que des circonstances l'entourant; de la nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte, des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de son auteur et de sa capacit\u00e9 de payer.\n[76] Chacun de ces facteurs sera examin\u00e9 \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le. En ce qui concerne la nature et la gravit\u00e9, le Tribunal conclut que M. Harrison a diffus\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e des messages concernant des personnes qui ne sont pas de religion chr\u00e9tienne, ne sont pas de race blanche et ne sont pas de descendance anglaise et que ces messages \u00e9taient d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables, cruels et excessifs. Les personnes susmentionn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9es au ridicule, au ressentiment, \u00e0 l'hostilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la violence, ce qui cr\u00e9e un climat favorable au d\u00e9veloppement de la haine ou du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Les messages portent atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et sont m\u00e9prisants. Ils servent \u00e0 d\u00e9shumaniser les personnes qui appartiennent aux groupes vis\u00e9s. L'utilisation de propos racistes et de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes d\u00e9gradants est malveillante et insultante. L'appel r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la violence contre les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s r\u00e9v\u00e8le des sentiments de malice extr\u00eame. Les d\u00e9clarations exhortant \u00e0 la violence et au meurtre donnent \u00e0 penser que les victimes n'ont aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te leurs d\u00e9fauts, ce qui a pour effet de les d\u00e9shumaniser. Ces propos exposent incontestablement les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine, au m\u00e9pris et \u00e0 un danger physique r\u00e9el en donnant \u00e0 penser qu'ils constituent des cibles l\u00e9gitimes de violence aveugle. Les messages ne servent qu'\u00e0 engendrer et \u00e0 encourager l'envie, la m\u00e9fiance ou le ressentiment envers les personnes et les groupes vis\u00e9s, et, par cons\u00e9quent, ils engendrent la haine envers eux.\n[77] Selon moi, les messages d\u00e9montrent clairement que leur auteur est guid\u00e9 par ses opinions mal fond\u00e9es sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et par son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter les autres. La preuve \u00e9tablit clairement que l'intim\u00e9 visait \u00e0 exposer les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris et qu'il visait \u00e0 convaincre les gens \u00e0 penser comme lui. Il a clairement diffus\u00e9 ses messages avec une indiff\u00e9rence d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e quant aux cons\u00e9quences possibles de ses actes. Je tiens \u00e9galement compte du fait que l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d'avoir commis des voies de fait sur une personne en raison de la race de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[78] Comme facteur att\u00e9nuant, je conclus que les messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s au cours d'une p\u00e9riode de temps relativement courte et qu'il semble qu'aucun autre message n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 depuis 2004. De plus, je souligne que l'intim\u00e9 n'est pas en charge des sites Web susmentionn\u00e9s; il ne fait que participer \u00e0 ces divers sites Web. On n'a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucune preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'il existe une possibilit\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 affiche \u00e0 nouveau des messages comme ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s.\n[79] Le paragraphe 54(1.1) exige que le Tribunal tienne compte, avant d'imposer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire, de la capacit\u00e9 de payer de l'intim\u00e9. Comme le Tribunal l'a mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le fardeau de la preuve relatif \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de payer incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9 de ne pas participer \u00e0 l'audience et de ne pr\u00e9senter aucune preuve, le Tribunal n'est saisi d'aucune preuve qui donne \u00e0 penser que M. Harrison poss\u00e8de des moyens financiers limit\u00e9s.\n[80] Compte tenu de l'ensemble ce ces facteurs, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une amende de 1 000 $. L'ordonnance portant que l'intim\u00e9 paye cette amende est impos\u00e9e essentiellement en raison de la nature violente des messages. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne peut pas prendre \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re les appels au meurtre de personnes en raison de leur race, de leur religion ou de leur origine ethnique.\n[81] Le montant de l'amende doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9 par ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 ou par mandat poste \u00e0 l'ordre du Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, et doit \u00eatre re\u00e7u par le Tribunal dans les 35 jours de la date \u00e0 laquelle M. Harrison aura \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nVI. ORDONNANCE [82] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal d\u00e9clare que les droits garantis \u00e0 M. Warman par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s par Craig Harrison et il ordonne, en rapport avec la violation de l'article 13 de cette loi, que :\nCraig Harrison ou toute autre personne agissant d'un commun accord avec Craig Harrison, mette fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire qui consiste \u00e0 utiliser ou de faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement, pour diffuser des messages du genre de ceux pour lesquels on a conclu en l'esp\u00e8ce qu'ils violaient le paragraphe 13(1), ou des messages fondamentalement semblables, susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite, et ce, en contravention de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. M. Harrison paye une amende au montant de 1 000 $. Le montant de l'amende doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9 par ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 ou par mandat poste \u00e0 l'ordre du Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, et doit \u00eatre re\u00e7u par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dans les 35 jours de la date \u00e0 laquelle M.

L'ALL\u00c9GATION DE NON-RESPECT PAR LE PLAIGNANT DES DIRECTIVES DU TRIBUNAL \u00c0 L'\u00c9GARD DE LA DIVULGATION\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision portant sur un certain nombre de questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Richard Warman contre Melissa Guille et le groupe Canadian Heritage Alliance. La plainte vise la propagande haineuse qui aurait fait l'objet de communications en contravention du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] Les questions se rapportent principalement \u00e0 la divulgation de documents potentiellement pertinents. Je vais traiter \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le de chacune de ces questions.\nI. LES LISTES DE MEMBRES DU GROUPE CANADIAN HERITAGE ALLIANCE [3] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 12 juillet 2006, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s de fournir la ou les listes des personnes qui au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente \u00e9taient membres du groupe Canadian Heritage Alliance puisque ces documents \u00e9taient potentiellement pertinents quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. Mme Guille a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui donne la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9battre de la question de la modification de l'ordonnance du Tribunal. Le Tribunal a accueilli la demande de Mme Guille.\n[4] Dans ses observations, Mme Guille soutient que la seule importance d'une liste de membres, si une telle liste existe, est qu'elle pourrait \u00e9tablir si le groupe a ou non des membres et peut-\u00eatre le nombre de membres. Dans sa d\u00e9claration \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, Mme Guille a correctement identifi\u00e9 la pertinence potentielle de la liste de membres quant aux questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Comme cela est mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 13 mars 2006, la question de savoir si le groupe Canadian Heritage Alliance est un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord au sens du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi est une question qui sera tranch\u00e9e sur le fondement d'un dossier de preuve complet (Warman c. Melissa Guille et Canadian Heritage Alliance, 2006 TCDP 12). La ou les listes de membres, si elles existent, sont pertinentes quant \u00e0 cette question.\n[5] Mme Guille a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que des renseignements \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des membres du groupe Canadian Heritage Alliance peuvent \u00eatre obtenus par d'autres moyens ou au cours de son contre-interrogatoire si elle choisit de t\u00e9moigner. Toutefois, le paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit que les documents potentiellement pertinents pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n'est invoqu\u00e9, qu'ils soient favorables ou non aux causes des parties, doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Il n'est pas important de savoir si les renseignements peuvent \u00eatre obtenus par d'autres moyens. Si les documents existent et s'ils sont en la possession des parties, ils doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 moins qu'un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation soit invoqu\u00e9. Mme Guille n'a pas invoqu\u00e9 un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du ou des documents en cause.\n[6] Il semblerait que la r\u00e9ticence de Mme Guille \u00e0 divulguer de telles listes est fond\u00e9e sur une pr\u00e9occupation selon laquelle le plaignant pourrait utiliser les noms apparaissant sur les listes \u00e0 des fins qui n'ont pas de liens avec le pr\u00e9sent litige. Cependant, dans des affaires comme la pr\u00e9sente affaire o\u00f9 on a ordonn\u00e9 la divulgation de documents confidentiels, la r\u00e8gle de l'engagement implicite s'applique. La raison d'\u00eatre de cette r\u00e8gle est qu'une partie \u00e0 un litige devrait avoir le droit d'obtenir une divulgation compl\u00e8te et d'examiner les renseignements pertinents, y compris ceux qui sont confidentiels, autant qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire de le faire pour qu'il y ait une d\u00e9cision \u00e9quitable dans l'affaire. N\u00e9anmoins, les parties ne sont pas autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 utiliser \u00e0 des fins accessoires au litige les documents divulgu\u00e9s (AFPC c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations, 2004 TCDP 38, au paragraphe 12). En sa qualit\u00e9 d'avocat, le plaignant est soumis \u00e0 des obligations et des r\u00e8gles de conduite professionnelles lui interdisant d'utiliser les renseignements contenus sur les listes \u00e0 des fins qui ne sont pas li\u00e9es au pr\u00e9sent litige.\n[7] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 Mme Guille de divulguer la ou les listes de membres du groupe Canadian Heritage Alliance qu'elle a en sa possession pour les p\u00e9riodes pertinentes.\nII. LE R\u00d4LE DE M. ALEXIAN KULBASHIAN DANS LA PR\u00c9SENTE PLAINTE [8] Au cours de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'instance le 22 juin 2006, Mme Guille a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait possible que M. Alexian Kulbashian agisse en tant que son repr\u00e9sentant et qu'il puisse \u00e9galement \u00eatre un t\u00e9moin pour les intim\u00e9s. Elle a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui fournisse des copies de toute la correspondance se rapportant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 de communiquer avec M. Kulbashian lors de tous les appels portant sur la gestion de l'instance. Le Tribunal fournira \u00e9galement \u00e0 M. Kulbashian des copies de toute future correspondance dans le dossier.\n[9] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a avis\u00e9 Mme Guille que si M. Kulbashian agissait en tant que son repr\u00e9sentant au cours de l'audience, elle s'opposerait \u00e0 ce qu'il pr\u00e9sente un t\u00e9moignage pour les intim\u00e9s. La Commission a par la suite demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance emp\u00eachant M. Kulbashian de t\u00e9moigner lors de l'audience. La demande \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est rejet\u00e9e. Le r\u00f4le que jouera M. Kulbashian lors de l'audience, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, n'est pas clair. Par cons\u00e9quent, toute ordonnance \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard serait inappropri\u00e9e pour le moment.\nIII. L'ALL\u00c9GATION DE NON-RESPECT PAR LES INTIM\u00c9S DES DIRECTIVES DU TRIBUNAL \u00c0 L'\u00c9GARD DE LA DIVULGATION [10] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 21 juillet 2006, la Commission a mentionn\u00e9 que les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas respect\u00e9 un certain nombre des directives fournies par le Tribunal lors de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'instance le 22 juin 2006. La Commission a indiqu\u00e9 que les documents suivants n'ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s :\nLe curriculum vit\u00e6 complet du t\u00e9moin expert des intim\u00e9s incluant les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents et les comp\u00e9tences, de m\u00eame que ses notes d'allocution pour les contrats pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans le rapport. Les documents que les intim\u00e9s ont en leur possession et qui se rapportent \u00e0 l'entente d'h\u00e9bergement du site Web, qu'il s'agisse d'une entente, d'un contrat, de courriels, etc. Les documents que les intim\u00e9s ont en leur possession et qui se rapportent au processus utilis\u00e9 pour exclure des individus ou pour retirer des affichages du site Web.\n[11] De plus, la Commission a mentionn\u00e9 que les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas fourni une liste \u00e0 jour de leurs t\u00e9moins, accompagn\u00e9e d'une d\u00e9claration plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e quant au t\u00e9moignage propos\u00e9 de chacun des t\u00e9moins, comme le Tribunal l'a ordonn\u00e9. Finalement, les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas fourni un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 \u00e9non\u00e7ant la nature de leur d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en ce qui porte sur le rapport d'expert.\n[12] Mme Guille a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle ne s'est pas conform\u00e9e aux directives du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la divulgation additionnelle parce qu'elle avait le sentiment qu'en raison de son inexp\u00e9rience dans le domaine juridique et de l'omission de la Commission d'avoir donn\u00e9 un avis \u00e9crit quant aux demandes de divulgation, elle ne pouvait pas comprendre ce qu'on lui demandait au cours de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'instance le 22 juin 2006 et r\u00e9pondre correctement \u00e0 ces demandes.\n[13] Compte tenu des circonstances, je suis dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 donner \u00e0 Mme Guille deux semaines \u00e0 compter de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision pour fournir des observations quant aux raisons pour lesquelles les directives du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la divulgation des documents pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es.\nIV. L'ALL\u00c9GATION DE NON-RESPECT PAR LE PLAIGNANT DES DIRECTIVES DU TRIBUNAL \u00c0 L'\u00c9GARD DE LA DIVULGATION [14] Au cours d'une conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'instance le 6 avril 2006, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 au plaignant de fournir les documents qu'il a en sa possession et qui se rapportent aux comptes qu'il a cr\u00e9\u00e9s sur tous les sites Web ou forums li\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte. Le Tribunal lui a de plus ordonn\u00e9 de fournir des copies des courriels ou messages qu'il a affich\u00e9s sur ces sites Web ou forums. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette directive en d\u00e9clarant qu'il n'avait aucun dossier quant \u00e0 quelques affichages qu'il a faits sur le forum ou le site Web du groupe Canadian Heritage Alliance.\n[15] Les intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent que M. Warman ne dit pas la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l'existence de tels documents ou qu'il a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment d\u00e9truit les documents afin de se soustraire aux exigences de divulgation. Les intim\u00e9s ont demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance exigeant que le plaignant r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 un interrogatoire sous la forme d'un affidavit pour obtenir une divulgation compl\u00e8te.\n[16] Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal pr\u00e9voient que les parties sont tenues de divulguer les documents potentiellement pertinents qu'elles ont en leur possession. Les parties ne sont pas tenues de cr\u00e9er des documents \u00e0 des fins de divulgation (Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 42). Le fait de demander au plaignant de produire un affidavit \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 lui demander de cr\u00e9er un document \u00e0 des fins de divulgation. Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s en vue de forcer M. Warman \u00e0 produire un affidavit.\n[17] Toutefois, les intim\u00e9s sont libres de poser les questions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans leur interrogatoire du plaignant au cours du contre-interrogatoire. Dans l'intervalle, je rappelle aux parties qu'elles ont une obligation continue de divulguer les documents potentiellement pertinents, qu'ils soient favorables ou non \u00e0 leurs causes.\nKaren A.

LES ORDONNANCES DEMAND\u00c9ES DANS L'AVIS DE REQU\u00caTE VISANT LA PRODUCTION DE DOCUMENTS (QUESTIONS RELATIVES \u00c0 LA CONSTITUTION)\n[1] L'intim\u00e9, Marc Lemire, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux avis de requ\u00eate. Dans la premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate, il demande [traduction] d'autres pr\u00e9cisions et une divulgation additionnelle de la part du plaignant, Richard Warman, et de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Dans la deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate, il demande [traduction] de la part du plaignant et de la Commission, la production de documents touchant les [traduction] questions relatives \u00e0 la Constitution. Les deux requ\u00eates se rapportent par cons\u00e9quent au respect par les parties de l'article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[2] Selon le paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles, chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\n6(1)a) les faits pertinents que la partie cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l'appui de sa cause;\n6(1)d) les divers documents qu'elle a en sa possession - pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n'est invoqu\u00e9 - et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l'occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d'autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle.\n[3] Une copie de tout document dont il est fait mention conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles doit \u00eatre fournie aux autres parties (paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles).\n[4] M. Lemire all\u00e8gue essentiellement ce qui suit : a) que les faits pertinents \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e9tabli conjointement par la Commission et M. Warman sont insuffisants ou pr\u00e9sentent des lacunes \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards; b) que la Commission et M. Warman n'ont pas divulgu\u00e9 certains documents qui auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s suivant l'alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles.\n[5] Dans la d\u00e9cision Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Gouvernement des Territoires du Nord-Ouest (Ministre du Personnel), [1999] D.C.D.P. no 8 (T.C.D.P.) (QL), le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 que les pr\u00e9cisions ont pour but de d\u00e9finir les questions, d'\u00e9viter les surprises, de permettre aux parties de se pr\u00e9parer au proc\u00e8s, et de faciliter l'audience. \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de la communication des faits pertinents, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [l]a r\u00e8gle de base est que les parties devraient d\u00e9voiler suffisamment de faits pour permettre aux autres parties de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l'audience. Toutefois, une partie n'a droit qu'aux faits pertinents sur lesquels l'autre partie s'appuie. Elle n'a pas droit \u00e0 un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la preuve que l'autre partie entend pr\u00e9senter ni \u00e0 ses arguments et \u00e0 son raisonnement.\n[6] \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de la divulgation de documents, l'alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles dicte que les documents se rapportant \u00e0 des faits, \u00e0 des questions et \u00e0 des redressements demand\u00e9s dans l'affaire doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Le crit\u00e8re qui s'applique \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pertinence consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les documents en question sont potentiellement pertinents quant \u00e0 l'audience (voir Bushey c. Sharma, [2003] D.C.D.P. no 7 (T.C.D.P.) (QL), au paragraphe 4). Le Tribunal a trait\u00e9 de la question de la pertinence dans la d\u00e9cision Syndicat canadien des communications, de l'\u00e9nergie et du papier c. Bell Canada, [2005] D.C.D.P. no 34 (T.C.D.P.) (QL). Le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9, en renvoyant aux conclusions de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Smith & Nephew c. Glegg, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 724, qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question de la pertinence, une partie doit d\u00e9montrer que la divulgation d'un document est utile, appropri\u00e9e, susceptible de faire progresser le d\u00e9bat, et repose sur un objectif acceptable qu'il cherche \u00e0 atteindre dans le dossier, et que le document se rapporte au litige.\n[7] En ayant ces consid\u00e9rations en t\u00eate, je vais maintenant traiter des demandes pr\u00e9cises contenues dans les requ\u00eates de M. Lemire.\nI. LES ORDONNANCES DEMAND\u00c9ES DANS L'AVIS DE REQU\u00caTE VISANT D'AUTRES PR\u00c9CISIONS ET UNE DIVULGATION ADDITIONNELLE [8] \u00c0 la fin de cet avis de requ\u00eate, M. Lemire a compil\u00e9 une liste d'ordonnances qu'il cherche \u00e0 obtenir du Tribunal. Je vais traiter de ces demandes, article par article.\nA. Les articles a), b), c), d) et e) [9] Les articles a) jusqu'\u00e0 e) sont de nature semblable. Les ordonnances demand\u00e9es sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9es comme suit :\n[traduction]\nQue le plaignant donne les noms des fournisseurs de services Internet qu'il utilisait pour acc\u00e9der aux sites freedomsite.org, stormfront.org et jrsbookonline.com en 2003 et 2004, et les noms de comptes qu'il utilisait. Que le plaignant indique le lieu o\u00f9 se trouvaient les ordinateurs qu'il utilisait pour acc\u00e9der au site freedomsite.org (c'est-\u00e0-dire la maison ou les bureaux de la Commission). Que le plaignant fournisse le ou les courriels qu'il utilisait pour obtenir l'acc\u00e8s au babillard \u00e9lectronique du site freedomsite.org. Que le plaignant fournisse le ou les mots de passe qu'il utilisait pour obtenir l'acc\u00e8s au babillard \u00e9lectronique du site freedomsite.org. Que le plaignant fournisse les noms (ou pseudonymes) qu'il utilisait pour ouvrir une session de bavardage sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique du site freedomsite.org.\n[10] Ces demandes semblent \u00eatre des demandes visant \u00e0 obtenir d'autres pr\u00e9cisions, par opposition \u00e0 des demandes de divulgation de documents pr\u00e9cis. M. Warman et la Commission d\u00e9clarent, dans la section se rapportant aux faits pertinents de l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qu'ils ont \u00e9tabli conjointement en date du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2005, que M. Warman a vu sur les sites freedomsite.org, stormfront.org et jrsbooksonline.com, en novembre 2003 et en octobre 2004, la pr\u00e9tendue propagande haineuse.\n[11] M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend que pour avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces sites Web et aux lignes de bavardage qui s'y trouvent, il faut s'inscrire sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique ou entrer en tant qu'invit\u00e9 en utilisant un ordinateur avec une seule adresse de protocole Internet. Il faut, pour obtenir un acc\u00e8s complet, fournir une adresse de courriel valide. M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend qu'il demande les pr\u00e9cisions qu'il cherche \u00e0 obtenir suivant ces articles de sa requ\u00eate afin de [traduction] v\u00e9rifier le fichier journal du babillard \u00e9lectronique et de [traduction] confirmer que M. Warman dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n[12] \u00c0 mon avis, les faits pertinents fournis par M. Warman et la Commission \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des sites Web visit\u00e9s et des dates des visites suffisent pour permettre \u00e0 M. Lemire de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l'audience. M. Lemire a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 que M. Warman entend prouver qu'il a visit\u00e9 ces sites et qu'il a vu la pr\u00e9tendue propagande haineuse. Il appartient \u00e0 M. Warman et \u00e0 la Commission de prouver ces faits. M. Lemire pourra de fa\u00e7on plus appropri\u00e9e approfondir toute question se rapportant \u00e0 l'exactitude ou \u00e0 la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de la preuve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces visites lors d'un contre-interrogatoire.\n[13] Les ordonnances demand\u00e9es aux articles a), b), c), d) et e) sont par cons\u00e9quent refus\u00e9es.\nB. L'article f) [14] La demande \u00e0 l'article f est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme suit :\n[traduction]\nf) Que le plaignant fournisse des copies de toutes les versions papier qu'il a faites au cours de ses visites du site freedomsite.org et de son babillard \u00e9lectronique.\n[15] Au soutien de cette demande, M. Lemire a pr\u00e9tendu dans sa requ\u00eate que M. Warman [traduction] a pu faire des versions papier d'autres messages qu'il a choisi de ne pas utiliser dans la plainte et que [traduction] s'il a imprim\u00e9 d'autres messages du babillard Web, pourquoi ne les a-t-il pas inclus dans la plainte?\n[16] Une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9vidente peut \u00eatre que M. Warman n'estimait pas que les autres documents contrevenaient \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et qu'il ne les a par cons\u00e9quent pas inclus dans la plainte. N\u00e9anmoins, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter que tous les documents qu'une partie a en sa possession et qui se rapportent aux messages mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte puissent \u00eatre potentiellement pertinents quant aux faits en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. J'ordonne par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 M. Warman de divulguer, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) et au paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles, des copies de toutes les versions papier qu'il a en sa possession et qu'il a imprim\u00e9es au cours de ses visites du site freedomsite.org et de son babillard \u00e9lectronique, avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte.\nC. L'article g) [17] La demande \u00e0 l'article g est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme suit :\n[traduction]\ng) Que le plaignant fournisse des copies de tous les messages qu'il a affich\u00e9s sur les babillards \u00e9lectroniques des sites freedomsite.org et stormfront.org, ou toutes les r\u00e9ponses aux messages qu'il a affich\u00e9es sur ces babillards Web.\n[18] M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend dans sa requ\u00eate que dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire il est en quelque sorte pertinent de savoir si M. Warman a essay\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer les pr\u00e9tendues communications de propagande haineuse ou d'informer les participants au babillard \u00e9lectronique que certains des messages affich\u00e9s \u00e9taient racistes. Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne vois pas comment cette question est pertinente quant aux points soulev\u00e9s dans la plainte. Si la preuve \u00e9tablit que M. Lemire a communiqu\u00e9 ou fait communiquer de la propagande haineuse de la mani\u00e8re envisag\u00e9e par l'article 13 de la Loi, sa responsabilit\u00e9 sera engag\u00e9e ind\u00e9pendamment des actes ou omissions de M. Warman.\n[19] Cependant, M. Lemire dit ensuite qu'il se peut que la mani\u00e8re et la facilit\u00e9 avec lesquelles les individus qui ont des opinions contraires peuvent participer \u00e0 ces babillards \u00e9lectroniques soient pertinentes quant aux points qu'il a soulev\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la validit\u00e9 sur le plan constitutionnel de l'article 13 de la Loi. J'accepte que les affichages faits par M. Warman sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[20] J'ordonne par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 M. Warman de fournir toutes les copies, qu'il a en sa possession, des messages qu'il a affich\u00e9s sur les babillards \u00e9lectroniques des sites freedomsite.org et stormfront.org ou toutes les r\u00e9ponses qu'il a affich\u00e9es sur ces babillards.\nD. L'article h) [21] La demande \u00e0 l'article h est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme suit :\n[traduction]\nh) Que le plaignant et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne produisent tous les documents, qu'ils ont en leur possession ou dont ils obtiendront la possession, se rapportant \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 de la personne qui a affich\u00e9 les messages sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique du site de l'intim\u00e9 sous le nom de Craig Harrison.\n[22] Dans sa r\u00e9plique aux observations des autres parties, dat\u00e9e du 29 juin 2006, M. Lemire a reconnu qu'il \u00e9tait en train de recevoir les documents demand\u00e9s suivant cet article. Je ne peux que tenir pour acquis que cette demande est par cons\u00e9quent retir\u00e9e.\nE. L'article i) [23] La demande \u00e0 l'article i est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme suit :\n[traduction]\ni) Que le plaignant et la Commission produisent une compilation des messages qui constituent, selon ce qu'ils all\u00e8guent, de la propagande haineuse au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, en y marquant de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e les portions sur lesquelles ils appuient express\u00e9ment leur pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle elles exposent des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n[24] M. Lemire souligne dans sa requ\u00eate que la Commission et M. Warman ont produit plus de 133 pages de messages lors de leur divulgation de documents, dans lesquelles on retrouve des centaines de messages. Aucun des messages n'a de soulignement ou de marque indiquant les portions qui exposent soi-disant des groupes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n[25] M. Warman soutient qu'il a fourni suffisamment de pr\u00e9cisions. Il mentionne dans ses observations que sa plainte initiale expose 29 exemples du type d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments qu'on retrouve dans les documents divulgu\u00e9s qui, selon ce qu'il all\u00e8gue, contreviennent \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi. Il soutient que ces exemples sont suffisants quant \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation et qu'ils fournissent \u00e0 M. Lemire la possibilit\u00e9 de conna\u00eetre la preuve contre laquelle il doit se d\u00e9fendre.\n[26] Je ne partage pas son opinion. Produire plus de cent pages de messages puis se r\u00e9server le droit de choisir n'importe lequel de ces messages et pr\u00e9tendre lors de l'audience qu'il constitue une violation au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi privent M. Lemire d'une possibilit\u00e9 v\u00e9ritable et efficace de conna\u00eetre la preuve contre laquelle il doit se d\u00e9fendre. Si la Commission et M. Warman adoptent la position que chaque message qu'on trouve sur chacune des pages divulgu\u00e9es constitue de la propagande haineuse, alors ils devraient le dire express\u00e9ment. M. Lemire pourra alors se consid\u00e9rer comme pr\u00e9venu et se pr\u00e9parer en cons\u00e9quence.\n[27] Cependant, si la Commission et M. Warman croient de bonne foi que seulement certains des messages contenus dans les pages divulgu\u00e9es contreviennent \u00e0 la Loi, alors ils devraient agir ouvertement en d\u00e9clarant leur position \u00e0 l'autre partie et en lui donnant des d\u00e9tails \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[28] J'ordonne par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 M. Warman d'indiquer express\u00e9ment les messages qui, selon ce qu'ils all\u00e8guent, constituent de la propagande haineuse au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi.\nII. LES ORDONNANCES DEMAND\u00c9ES DANS L'AVIS DE REQU\u00caTE VISANT LA PRODUCTION DE DOCUMENTS (QUESTIONS RELATIVES \u00c0 LA CONSTITUTION) [29] Le 25 novembre 2005, M. Lemire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire un avis de question relative \u00e0 la Constitution dans lequel il all\u00e9guait que l'article 13 et le paragraphe 54(1)(1.1) de la Loi contreviennent aux alin\u00e9as 2a) et b), et aux articles 7, 26 et 31 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, et que ces contraventions ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par les restrictions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 1. Il all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement qu'il y a eu contravention aux alin\u00e9as 1d) et f) de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits.\n[30] Dans cet avis de requ\u00eate, M. Lemire all\u00e8gue que la Commission a omis de divulguer des documents qui sont pertinents et utiles quant \u00e0 la question relative \u00e0 la Constitution qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e. En particulier, il demande que la Commission divulgue des documents \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des activit\u00e9s de la Commission qui int\u00e9ressent l'article 13 de la Loi.\n[31] M. Lemire souligne que le Tribunal, lors de son analyse de la question relative \u00e0 la Constitution, peut \u00eatre tenu d'examiner la question de savoir si la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e aux droits et libert\u00e9s garantis par la Constitution que l'on invoque est justifi\u00e9e suivant l'article 1 de la Charte. Il a renvoy\u00e9 aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103, et en particulier au crit\u00e8re de proportionnalit\u00e9 dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 aux paragraphes 70 et 71 de l'arr\u00eat. La Cour supr\u00eame a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il faut, lors de l'analyse, soupeser les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et ceux de particuliers et de groupes. Il doit y avoir proportionnalit\u00e9 entre les effets des mesures restreignant un droit ou une libert\u00e9 garantis par la Charte et l'objectif des mesures. La Cour supr\u00eame a ajout\u00e9 que l'analyse des effets est tr\u00e8s large. Il est possible que compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 des effets pr\u00e9judiciables d'une mesure sur des particuliers ou des groupes, la mesure ne soit pas justifi\u00e9e par les objectifs qu'elle est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 servir.\n[32] M. Lemire soutient que les effets pr\u00e9judiciables de l'article 13 de la Loi s'\u00e9tendent au-del\u00e0 des ordonnances que le Tribunal peut rendre apr\u00e8s qu'il a statu\u00e9 sur une plainte. Il all\u00e8gue que la Commission, dans l'exercice de ses pouvoirs pr\u00e9vus par la Loi, s'est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s qui ont eu l'effet pr\u00e9judiciable de restreindre les droits et libert\u00e9s garantis par la Charte, hors de l'\u00e9tendue du processus d'audience du Tribunal. Par exemple, M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend que la Commission a pu influencer les fournisseurs de services Internet (FSI) d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e0 les pousser \u00e0 retirer des sites Web jug\u00e9s r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles par la Commission, sans qu'une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l'exploitant du site Web.\n[33] Dans les faits, la Commission obtiendrait par cons\u00e9quent une interdiction extrajudiciaire de mat\u00e9riel expressif. M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend qu'il s'agit d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable de l'article 13 qui doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 lors de l'analyse du crit\u00e8re de proportionnalit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Oakes.\n[34] La position de la Commission, en r\u00e9plique, comporte fondamentalement deux volets : d'abord que la demande de documents est [traduction] exag\u00e9r\u00e9e et ambigu\u00eb - une question que je traiterai s\u00e9par\u00e9ment ci-apr\u00e8s - puis que les documents demand\u00e9s ne sont pas potentiellement pertinents quant \u00e0 la question relative \u00e0 la Constitution. \u00c0 mon avis, la Commission ne traite pas directement de l'argument soulev\u00e9 par M. Lemire. La Commission n'a pas \u00e9tabli la raison pour laquelle les pr\u00e9tentions de M. Lemire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pertinence de l'analyse en mati\u00e8re constitutionnelle sont d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de fondement.\n[35] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9, selon l'article 6 des R\u00e8gles, des documents qui se rapportent \u00e0 une question en litige, qu'il s'agisse d'une question soulev\u00e9e par l'une partie ou par l'autre, doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, M. Lemire a soulev\u00e9 une question quant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 sur le plan constitutionnel de l'article 13 et il se peut, lors de l'analyse de cette question, qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire que les effets pr\u00e9judiciables de l'article 13 soient examin\u00e9s. Cela pourrait inclure la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle ces effets entra\u00eenent la violation de droits et libert\u00e9s garantis par la Charte par des moyens autres que les ordonnances du Tribunal rendues apr\u00e8s qu'il a statu\u00e9 sur une plainte. Ces effets se rapportent \u00e0 une question d\u00e9finie par une partie dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire et par cons\u00e9quent tout document se rapportant \u00e0 ces effets doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9.\n[36] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, dans ses observations quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, pr\u00e9sente un argument diff\u00e9rent de celui de la Commission. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral soutient que M. Lemire, en soulevant \u00e0 titre de question litigieuse [traduction] la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle la Commission s'acquitte de son mandat, tente de contester en se fondant sur la Charte, l'interpr\u00e9tation et l'application de l'article 13 de la Loi que la Commission fait en s'acquittant de son mandat suivant l'article 27 et le paragraphe 49(1). Il pr\u00e9tend que les seules fa\u00e7ons par lesquelles M. Lemire peut faire une telle contestation sont un contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou une demande ou une action pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant une cour sup\u00e9rieure provinciale en vue d'obtenir une d\u00e9claration.\n[37] M. Lemire r\u00e9pond qu'il ne cherche pas \u00e0 obtenir du Tribunal un examen du caract\u00e8re licite des activit\u00e9s de la Commission. Plut\u00f4t, il cherche \u00e0 obtenir un examen de la question de savoir si les [traduction] effets pr\u00e9judiciables que la Loi a sur la libert\u00e9 d'expression surpassent les effets b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques.\n[38] \u00c0 mon avis, les deux parties soul\u00e8vent des points int\u00e9ressants qui peuvent \u00eatre correctement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s devant le Tribunal qui statue sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la contestation constitutionnelle et de la plainte dans l'ensemble. \u00c0 l'\u00e9tape actuelle de l'instance, cependant, la question qui m'est soumise est une question tr\u00e8s \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire : les documents demand\u00e9s se rapportent-ils \u00e0 une question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par l'une des parties dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire?\n[39] J'accepte la pr\u00e9tention de M. Lemire selon laquelle il existe un lien entre la question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'article 13 et du paragraphe 54(1)(1.1) de la Loi et tout document se rapportant \u00e0 quelque activit\u00e9 de la Commission qui peut avoir un effet sur les droits et libert\u00e9s garantis par la Charte. Les documents doivent par cons\u00e9quent faire l'objet d'une divulgation conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 6 des R\u00e8gles.\n[40] Mais cela ne met pas fin \u00e0 l'affaire. La Commission soutient que les demandes de production de documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par M. Lemire sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9es et ambigu\u00ebs. \u00c0 mon avis, l'\u00e9valuation que fait la Commission \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard semble particuli\u00e8rement applicable aux demandes sous les titres (h), (k) et (n), du paragraphe 37 de l'avis de requ\u00eate, qui sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9es comme suit :\n[traduction]\nh) Tous les documents internes se rapportant \u00e0 la haine et \u00e0 Internet \u00e0 compter de 1993 (\u00e0 l'exclusion des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au Tribunal dans les instances suivant l'article 13 de la Loi, des transcriptions de telles instances ou de la correspondance interne de l'avocat se rapportant \u00e0 ces dossiers).\nk) Tous les documents se rapportant \u00e0 la formation et aux proc\u00e9dures de l'\u00e9quipe sp\u00e9ciale anti-haine constitu\u00e9e afin de traiter les plaintes suivant l'article 13, notamment toute directive visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer ce qui constitue de la haine ou du m\u00e9pris et \u00e0 former du personnel pour d\u00e9terminer ce qui constitue de la haine au sens de l'article 13.\nn) Tous les documents concernant les activit\u00e9s de la Commission suivant l'article 27 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne qui ont un lien avec la haine sur Internet.\n[41] Comme le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Bell Canada, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 12 \u00e0 14, des demandes de divulgation qui sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9es et qui ne sont pas pr\u00e9cises, et qui \u00e9quivalent fondamentalement \u00e0 un proverbial interrogatoire \u00e0 l'aveuglette, seront rejet\u00e9es.\n[42] \u00c0 mon avis, les articles (h), (k) et (n) font partie de cette cat\u00e9gorie. Les demandes sont d'une nature excessivement g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et comprennent des aspects des activit\u00e9s de la Commission qui ne sont pas susceptibles de se rapporter aux questions en litige. Par exemple, il n'est aucunement clair de quelle fa\u00e7on les documents se rapportant aux activit\u00e9s internes de la Commission peuvent avoir un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur les droits et libert\u00e9s garantis par la Charte pour les personnes \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la Commission. Ce n'est qu'une fois que l'activit\u00e9 de la Commission s'\u00e9tend \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de l'organisation et touche des droits ou libert\u00e9s garantis par la Charte qu'un document s'y rapportant devient potentiellement pertinent quant \u00e0 la question d\u00e9finie par M. Lemire.\n[43] Par contre, j'accepte que les demandes des articles (j), (l) et (m) sont potentiellement pertinentes et ne sont pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9es ou ambigu\u00ebs :\n[traduction]\nj) Tous les documents se rapportant aux relations de la Commission avec les fournisseurs de services Internet, notamment ceux se rapportant aux tentatives visant \u00e0 exercer une pression sur les FSI pour qu'ils ferment les sites Web ou les retirent.\nl) Tous les documents se rapportant \u00e0 des r\u00e9unions, \u00e0 du r\u00e9seautage et \u00e0 de la consultation avec tout groupe repr\u00e9sentant un des groupes prot\u00e9g\u00e9s contre la discrimination suivant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et avec tout service de police ou toute agence gouvernementale ayant un lien avec la haine sur Internet.\nm) Tous les documents se rapportant aux activit\u00e9s \u00e9ducatives ou publicitaires de la Commission \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la haine.\n[44] M. Lemire avait initialement demand\u00e9 la production de deux autres s\u00e9ries de documents (les articles (i) et (o)), mais il semble, selon sa correspondance subs\u00e9quente avec le Tribunal, qu'il a obtenu ces documents d'autres sources. Je tiens pour acquis par cons\u00e9quent que ces demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es.\n[45] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du deuxi\u00e8me avis de requ\u00eate, j'ordonne \u00e0 la Commission de divulguer tous les documents qu'elle a en sa possession se rapportant aux articles (j), (l) et (m), comme cela est pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9, selon ce qui est \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 au paragraphe 37 de l'avis de requ\u00eate de M. Lemire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en vue d'obtenir la production de documents (questions relatives \u00e0 la Constitution), dat\u00e9 du 17 mai 2006.\n[46] Un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier quant \u00e0 la divulgation de ces documents pourra \u00eatre \u00e9tabli lors d'une prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique sur la gestion du cas.\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] La plaignante, Catherine Hoyt, all\u00e8gue que son employeur, la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (CN), ne lui a pas fourni un accommodement quant \u00e0 sa grossesse et quant \u00e0 ses obligations parentales. Elle soutient que le CN a par cons\u00e9quent exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur son sexe et sur sa situation de famille, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi ou la LCDP).\n[2] Le syndicat de la plaignante, les Travailleurs unis des transports (le syndicat), a demand\u00e9 et a obtenu le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 l'instance. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le CN all\u00e8gue que le syndicat n'a pas agi d'une mani\u00e8re coop\u00e9rative ou raisonnable \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'accommodement \u00e0 offrir \u00e0 Mme Hoyt. Le membre charg\u00e9 de la gestion de l'instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, compte tenu de ces all\u00e9gations, la r\u00e9putation du syndicat pouvait \u00eatre entach\u00e9e du fait de l'instance et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9 d'accorder au syndicat le statut qu'il demandait; il a ordonn\u00e9 que le syndicat soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter de la preuve, \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interrogatoires et \u00e0 des contre-interrogatoires de t\u00e9moins et \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des questions pour lesquelles ses int\u00e9r\u00eats pouvaient \u00eatre compromis et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa participation aux efforts d'accommodement.\n[3] L'audience a dur\u00e9 10 jours en avril 2006 et a comport\u00e9 une visite sur les lieux au triage Walker au terminal d'Edmonton du CN. Tant la plaignante que l'intim\u00e9e ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience et \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des avocats. Le syndicat a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience et \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience.\n[4] Pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, j'ai conclu que le CN a affectivement exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Hoyt en omettant de lui fournir un accommodement quant \u00e0 sa grossesse et j'ai conclu de plus que le CN a omis de lui fournir un accommodement quant \u00e0 ses obligations parentales. La plainte de Mme Hoyt est par cons\u00e9quent fond\u00e9e.\nII. LES FAITS A. La plaignante [5] Mme Hoyt fait partie de la troisi\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de sa famille \u00e0 travailler dans le domaine des chemins de fer. Ses deux grands-p\u00e8res, son p\u00e8re, deux de ses oncles et son fr\u00e8re ont travaill\u00e9 au CN. De plus, elle est mari\u00e9e avec un employ\u00e9 des chemins de fer.\n[6] En juillet 1991, Mme Hoyt a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par le CN. Elle a d'abord travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'aide-soudeuse dans diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9gions de l'Ontario, puis au printemps de 1995 elle a postul\u00e9 un emploi au terminal d'Edmonton du CN et elle a obtenu cet emploi. Elle savait, compte tenu des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de sa famille, que cela lui offrirait une bonne carri\u00e8re et lui procurerait une bonne fa\u00e7on de gagner sa vie et celle de sa famille, comme cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas pour d'autres membres de sa famille.\n[7] Quelques mois apr\u00e8s avoir chang\u00e9 de lieu de travail, Mme Hoyt a obtenu un poste de chef de train de manuvre au triage Walker \u00e0 Edmonton. Mme Hoyt \u00e9tait chef de train de manuvre au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\nB. L'intim\u00e9e [8] L'intim\u00e9e, le CN, exploite une ligne de chemin de fer et son entreprise consiste au transport de marchandises par voie ferr\u00e9e partout au pays.\n[9] Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements pertinents quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte ont eu lieu au terminal d'Edmonton du CN. Le terminal d'Edmonton comprend le triage Walker et trois triages satellites, soit le Bissell, le Cloverbar et Scotford. Environ 100 employ\u00e9s travaillent dans les triages. De plus, une partie de l'administration du terminal d'Edmonton \u00e9tait faite \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque dans l'\u00e9difice du CN au centre-ville d'Edmonton. Environ 200 employ\u00e9s travaillaient dans l'\u00e9difice administratif du centre-ville.\n[10] Une br\u00e8ve description de la nature de ces installations et de certaines des activit\u00e9s du CN sera utile pour comprendre les questions pertinentes quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n(i) Le triage Walker [11] \u00c0 diff\u00e9rents endroits dans tout le pays, l'intim\u00e9e a des installations qui permettent l'assemblage et le r\u00e9assemblage des trains selon les besoins. Le triage Walker est l'une de ces installations. Les chefs de train au triage Walker trient les wagons. Les trains entrent dans le triage avec des wagons en route vers divers lieux. Parfois, 20 wagons d'un train en particulier doivent continuer leur route vers la c\u00f4te ouest alors que 30 autres wagons doivent se rendre dans le nord de l'Alberta et ainsi de suite. Les trains doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9sassembl\u00e9s et ensuite r\u00e9assembl\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que les wagons continuent leur route vers leur destination d\u00e9finitive.\n[12] La proc\u00e9dure utilis\u00e9e pour trier les trains est plut\u00f4t ing\u00e9nieuse. Le triage Walker a une butte de gravit\u00e9. La butte de gravit\u00e9 est une pente tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8rement inclin\u00e9e. Les trains sont pouss\u00e9s sur la cr\u00eate de cette pente et les wagons sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s, soit individuellement soit en groupe, lorsqu'ils sont sur le point de descendre l'inclinaison. Il y a, au bas de la butte de gravit\u00e9, quarante voies s\u00e9par\u00e9es. Le r\u00e9glage des aiguillages des voies permet \u00e0 chaque wagon ou groupe de wagons d'\u00eatre dirig\u00e9 vers l'une ou l'autre des voies.\n[13] Les wagons, une fois qu'ils sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s sur la voie sur laquelle ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9s, sont alors r\u00e9assembl\u00e9s en pr\u00e9paration de leur d\u00e9part. Le r\u00e9assemblage est effectu\u00e9 par des chefs de train de manuvre qui utilisent des locomotives de triage pour pousser les wagons sur les voies jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils soient fix\u00e9s les uns aux autres dans l'ordre appropri\u00e9. Une fois que les wagons ont \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement assembl\u00e9s, ils sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 partir pour le tron\u00e7on suivant de leur voyage.\n[14] L'ampleur de l'op\u00e9ration au triage Walker est remarquable; le triage et ses voies s'\u00e9tendent sur plusieurs milles. Les wagons qui entrent dans le triage et le quittent ensuite p\u00e8sent 30 tonnes lorsqu'ils sont vides et peuvent peser de 120 \u00e0 130 tonnes lorsqu'ils sont pleins. Les enfilades de wagons qui entrent dans le triage ou qui y sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour en partir ont souvent un mille de long. Au cours d'une ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 chaque heure, des wagons sont pouss\u00e9s sur les voies du triage \u00e0 mesure qu'ils sont tri\u00e9s pour former des trains.\n[15] La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est une pr\u00e9occupation primordiale au CN, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 au cours de notre visite des lieux. Nous avons re\u00e7u de l'\u00e9quipement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 guid\u00e9s avec beaucoup de soins sur les lieux visit\u00e9s. La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 fait partie de la conception m\u00eame du mat\u00e9riel ferroviaire. Par exemple, le syst\u00e8me de freinage des trains utilise de la pression d'air. Cependant, la pression d'air n'est pas utilis\u00e9e pour appliquer les freins; elle est utilis\u00e9e pour les rel\u00e2cher. Cette conception assure que s'il y a une perte de pression d'air en raison d'une faille du mat\u00e9riel, le train s'arr\u00eatera. Les employ\u00e9s du CN d\u00e9crivent ce syst\u00e8me comme une protection en cas de d\u00e9faut; le mat\u00e9riel est con\u00e7u de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu'un manquement entra\u00eene une situation s\u00e9curitaire plut\u00f4t qu'une situation dangereuse.\n(ii) Le syst\u00e8me de loco-commande [16] Un des progr\u00e8s techniques introduits au triage d'Edmonton est la loco-commande (beltpack) ou l'unit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le de locomotive (L.C.U.). Une loco-commande permet \u00e0 un chef de train de manuvre de faire fonctionner une locomotive comme fonctionne une voiture comportant une commande \u00e0 distance. L'unit\u00e9, qui p\u00e8se environ 6 livres, est port\u00e9e en \u00e9tant fix\u00e9e au corps par un harnais. Elle contient des interrupteurs, des cadrans et des commutateurs qui permettent au chef de train de manuvre de mettre en marche, d'arr\u00eater et de contr\u00f4ler la vitesse et la direction d'une locomotive. La loco-commande comporte en outre une caract\u00e9ristique de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. La loco-commande, si elle est inclin\u00e9e dans un angle de plus de 45 degr\u00e9s, arr\u00eatera la locomotive apr\u00e8s quelques secondes \u00e0 moins que l'unit\u00e9 soit r\u00e9initialis\u00e9e par le chef de train. Il s'agit d'une fonction d'urgence con\u00e7ue afin d'\u00e9viter un accident ou d'autres blessures si le chef de train tombe ou a un malaise pendant qu'il fait fonctionner une locomotive. La loco-commande est un autre exemple d'une conception de protection en cas de d\u00e9faut.\n[17] Avant l'implantation des loco-commandes vers 1995, le CN utilisait des \u00e9quipes de trois personnes pour le triage des trains. Une personne, le m\u00e9canicien de locomotive, prenait place dans la locomotive elle-m\u00eame pendant que les deux autres se trouvaient sur le terrain \u00e0 chaque extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du train. Les trois personnes communiquaient par radio. Le CN utilisait encore \u00e0 l'occasion une \u00e9quipe de trois personnes au triage Walker \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque se rapportant \u00e0 la plainte. Lorsque les loco-commandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en application, les instructions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d'op\u00e9ration du CN pr\u00e9voyaient que les deux chefs de train de manuvre devaient porter une loco-commande et, de plus, que le chef de train \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 avant du mouvement contr\u00f4lait le train. L'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 avant du mouvement est l'avant du train. Lorsque le train change de direction, l'avant change d'une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les trains changent souvent de direction durant le processus de triage, les chefs de train doivent s'\u00e9changer la commande quand la direction change. Cette proc\u00e9dure est appel\u00e9e l'\u00e9change du signal de commande (pitch and catch). Quand les trains changent de direction, un chef de train de manuvre \u00e9change le contr\u00f4le du train avec l'autre chef de train.\n[18] \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque se rapportant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte, il y avait au CN un d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 la question de savoir s'il \u00e9tait s\u00e9curitaire que le CN utilise une \u00e9quipe de deux chefs de train de triage dans laquelle un des chefs de train utilise une loco-commande et l'autre une radio avec \u00e9metteur-r\u00e9cepteur. Le syndicat croyait que cette m\u00e9thode ne serait pas s\u00e9curitaire. La direction ne partageait pas cette opinion. Les proc\u00e8s-verbaux du comit\u00e9 du CN en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 montrent que ce d\u00e9saccord \u00e9tait une question en litige. Les instructions d'op\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00e0 ce moment exigeaient que dans une \u00e9quipe de deux chefs de train, les deux chefs de train utilisent une loco-commande. Les instructions d'op\u00e9ration pr\u00e9voyaient en outre que, si une loco-commande avait une d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9, l'\u00e9quipe devait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer une nouvelle loco-commande d\u00e8s que cela \u00e9tait raisonnablement possible.\n(iii) Le syst\u00e8me d'anciennet\u00e9 au CN - Le tableau de remplacement [19] L'intim\u00e9e a des activit\u00e9s vingt-quatre heures par jour. Des trains sont tri\u00e9s vingt-quatre heures par jour, chaque jour de l'ann\u00e9e. Le travail par quarts fait partie de la vie d'un employ\u00e9 des chemins de fer tout comme fait partie de sa vie l'impr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 des horaires de jour en jour et de semaine en semaine.\n[20] Les horaires de travail des employ\u00e9s de triage au CN sont \u00e9tablis en fonction de l'anciennet\u00e9. Les employ\u00e9s qui ont suffisamment d'anciennet\u00e9 peuvent avoir une affectation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Ces employ\u00e9s sont inform\u00e9s chaque vendredi de leur horaire de travail pour toute la semaine \u00e0 venir. Cependant, il peut arriver qu'un employ\u00e9 qui a re\u00e7u une affectation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re soit inform\u00e9 \u00e0 court pr\u00e9avis que ses services sont requis pour un poste sup\u00e9rieur, ou plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans la hi\u00e9rarchie de travail du CN, \u00e0 celui de son affectation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Ces postes sup\u00e9rieurs, une fois qu'ils sont offerts, doivent \u00eatre accept\u00e9s par l'employ\u00e9.\n[21] Les horaires des employ\u00e9s qui ont moins d'anciennet\u00e9 sont \u00e9tablis en fonction du tableau de remplacement. Le tableau de remplacement est un outil qui permet \u00e0 l'employeur de d\u00e9signer les employ\u00e9s dont il a besoin pour des quarts de travail et des affectations. Les employ\u00e9s sont inscrits sur ce tableau par ordre d'anciennet\u00e9 et les quarts de travail sont \u00e9tablis dans cet ordre. Les employ\u00e9s qui ont le plus d'anciennet\u00e9 et dont le nom appara\u00eet sur le tableau de remplacement obtiennent plus de quarts de travail r\u00e9guliers \u00e0 des moments plus favorables de la journ\u00e9e et de la semaine, alors que les employ\u00e9s qui ont moins d'anciennet\u00e9 obtiennent des quarts de travail moins r\u00e9guliers \u00e0 des moments moins favorables de la journ\u00e9e et de la semaine.\n[22] Pour s'assurer qu'un employ\u00e9 obtienne un quart de travail particulier ou pour lui permettre d'\u00e9viter un quart de travail particulier, il est habituellement n\u00e9cessaire qu'on lui fournisse une exemption quant aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s impr\u00e9visibles du tableau de remplacement. On parle alors du statut d'anciennet\u00e9 privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. Le consentement du syndicat est n\u00e9cessaire pour qu'un employ\u00e9 obtienne ce statut.\n(iv) La politique du CN en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement [23] Le CN a en place une politique qui traite des besoins d'accommodement des employ\u00e9s. Ses Directives aux chefs hi\u00e9rarchiques concernant les mesures d'adaptation \u00e9tablissent que la jurisprudence s'attend \u00e0 ce que les entreprises fassent des efforts raisonnables d'adaptation, sans toutefois s'imposer de contraintes excessives; elle \u00e9tablissent de plus que le co\u00fbt des mesures d'adaptation doit \u00eatre extr\u00eamement \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour justifier le refus d'une demande de telles mesures.\n[24] Un document intitul\u00e9 Mesures d'adaptation - Liste de contr\u00f4le \u00e0 l'intention des chefs hi\u00e9rarchiques expose le processus d'accommodement qui doit \u00eatre engag\u00e9 lorsque des mesures d'adaptation sont demand\u00e9es. La liste de contr\u00f4le donne au chef hi\u00e9rarchique la directive de rencontrer d'abord l'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des besoins d'accommodement, d'\u00e9tablir les besoins essentiels du poste habituel de l'employ\u00e9, de consulter d'autres repr\u00e9sentants du CN si n\u00e9cessaire et le syndicat, puis de d\u00e9cider si les fonctions du poste actuel de l'employ\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre ajust\u00e9es pour lui fournir un accommodement ou s'il peut \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des fonctions diff\u00e9rentes qui fourniraient un accommodement quant \u00e0 ses besoins ou ses restrictions. Les chefs hi\u00e9rarchiques ont la directive d'informer l'employ\u00e9 de leurs d\u00e9cisions, de donner des motifs quant \u00e0 ces d\u00e9cisions et de conserver des dossiers d\u00e9taill\u00e9s des mesures prises dans le processus d'accommodement.\nIII. LES FAITS DONNANT LIEU \u00c0 LA PLAINTE [25] En f\u00e9vrier 2002, apr\u00e8s 11 ann\u00e9es de service aupr\u00e8s de l'intim\u00e9e, Mme Hoyt a appris qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir certaines douleurs et certains malaises au travail. Son m\u00e9decin l'a examin\u00e9e et il a \u00e9crit au CN une lettre dans laquelle il expliquait que Mme Hoyt, en raison de sa grossesse, avait besoin que certaines modifications soient apport\u00e9es \u00e0 son travail. Le m\u00e9decin a ordonn\u00e9 que Mme Hoyt \u00e9vite les dangers, en particulier les activit\u00e9s ardues, et qu'elle travaille des heures r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Le m\u00e9decin a de plus ordonn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9vite d'utiliser une loco-commande.\n[26] Le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2002, Mme Hoyt a donn\u00e9 la lettre du m\u00e9decin au surintendant du CN qui l'a inform\u00e9e qu'elle devrait retourner chez elle en cong\u00e9 sans solde jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le CN ait le temps d'examiner l'affaire.\nA. La premi\u00e8re offre d'accommodement du CN [27] Le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2002, un surintendant adjoint a fourni \u00e0 Mme Hoyt une lettre qui \u00e9tablissait les mesures d'accommodement que le CN avait \u00e9tablies. Le CN avait propos\u00e9 qu'elle soit plac\u00e9e sur le quart de travail de l'apr\u00e8s-midi en tant que chef de train de manuvre \u00e0 la butte du triage Walker. Ce poste exigerait que Mme Hoyt porte une loco-commande. Dans la lettre, le CN demandait d'autres clarifications quant aux restrictions m\u00e9dicales et terminait la lettre comme suit :\n[traduction]\nPour le moment, il n'y a pas de fonctions modifi\u00e9es qui ne requi\u00e8rent pas l'utilisation de l'\u00e9quipement du syst\u00e8me de t\u00e9l\u00e9commande des locomotives de manuvre (LCS). Compte tenu de tous les tests effectu\u00e9s et des rapports techniques, la position de la compagnie est que l'\u00e9quipement du LCS est vis\u00e9 par les directives r\u00e9glementaires et ne pose aucun probl\u00e8me se rapportant \u00e0 la sant\u00e9.\nSi vous estimez ne pas pouvoir faire fonctionner l'\u00e9quipement du LCS, la compagnie vous accordera un cong\u00e9 sans solde. Pour le moment, il n'est pas raisonnablement possible de modifier les fonctions de votre emploi de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que l'\u00e9quipement du LCS ne soit pas utilis\u00e9.\nLa r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'\u00e9quipement du LCS est une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la loco-commande.\n[28] Mme Hoyt \u00e9tait afflig\u00e9e par cette offre d'accommodement. Le poste \u00e0 la butte du triage Walker, selon son exp\u00e9rience, \u00e9tait plus dur que son emploi habituel de chef de train de manuvre. Dans ce poste, il n'y avait qu'un chef de train de manuvre qui travaillait seul pour s\u00e9parer les wagons, un \u00e0 un ou en groupe, avant que les wagons commencent \u00e0 descendre sur la voie ferr\u00e9e. Le poste \u00e9tait, \u00e0 son avis, difficile et incessant. Le poste exigeait \u00e9galement l'utilisation de la loco-commande. Son m\u00e9decin avait ordonn\u00e9 qu'elle n'utilise pas la loco-commande. Elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 son syndicat. Le syndicat ne savait rien de la proposition d'accommodement faite par le CN.\n[29] Mme Hoyt est retourn\u00e9e chez son m\u00e9decin le lendemain. Le m\u00e9decin a fourni une lettre plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e dans laquelle il expliquait les raisons pour lesquelles la loco-commande ne devait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e :\n[traduction]\nLe port d'une loco-commande causera une pression abdominale et un poids sur le ftus qui se d\u00e9veloppe. Cela contribuera \u00e9galement \u00e0 des maux de dos \u00e0 mesure que la grossesse avance. Il est donc pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable qu'une loco-commande ne soit pas utilis\u00e9e pendant le reste de la grossesse.\nMme Hoyt a fourni au CN cette deuxi\u00e8me lettre.\nB. La deuxi\u00e8me offre d'accommodement du CN [30] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u cette deuxi\u00e8me note du m\u00e9decin, le CN a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me plan d'accommodement et a communiqu\u00e9 cette deuxi\u00e8me proposition au syndicat. Le CN proposait que Mme Hoyt occupe son ancien poste de chef de train de manuvre, mais qu'elle ne porte pas une loco-commande et qu'on lui fournisse plut\u00f4t une radio. Son coll\u00e8gue dirigerait le train dans les deux directions. Le CN proposait de plus qu'elle occupe le quart de travail r\u00e9gulier de l'apr\u00e8s-midi et, en cons\u00e9quence, il serait n\u00e9cessaire que Mme Hoyt obtienne le statut d'anciennet\u00e9 privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. Le consentement du syndicat serait n\u00e9cessaire.\n[31] Le syndicat a examin\u00e9 cette deuxi\u00e8me proposition et a exprim\u00e9 deux pr\u00e9occupations. La premi\u00e8re pr\u00e9occupation \u00e9tait la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, le syndicat avait adopt\u00e9 depuis longtemps la position selon laquelle il \u00e9tait dangereux d'utiliser une seule loco-commande dans une \u00e9quipe de deux chefs de train. Le syndicat a de plus exprim\u00e9 une pr\u00e9occupation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du statut d'anciennet\u00e9 privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. Il a demand\u00e9 au CN une assurance que serait indemnis\u00e9 tout employ\u00e9 qui perdrait un quart de travail en raison du fait que ce statut \u00e9tait conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Hoyt. Le CN a refus\u00e9 de donner cette assurance. Le syndicat a rejet\u00e9 cette proposition principalement en raison de la question de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et accessoirement en raison de la question de l'anciennet\u00e9.\n[32] Mme Hoyt partageait les pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es par le syndicat. Elle estimait \u00e9galement qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas s\u00e9curitaire de travailler en tant que chef de train de manuvre sans porter une loco-commande. Elle \u00e9tait de plus pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le fait que si le CN lui donnait un poste au triage d'un statut autre qu'un poste qu'elle pouvait obtenir suivant son statut d'anciennet\u00e9, elle pourrait subir du harc\u00e8lement sur le lieu de travail. Mme Hoyt a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'une coll\u00e8gue avait re\u00e7u r\u00e9cemment un tel accommodement. Mme Hoyt a entendu les commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants que faisaient d'autres coll\u00e8gues qui se plaignaient du traitement sp\u00e9cial que la femme recevait et Mme Hoyt a d\u00fb se porter \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de cette coll\u00e8gue. Le v\u00e9hicule de sa coll\u00e8gue a fait l'objet de vandalisme au cours de cette p\u00e9riode. Mme Hoyt \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le fait que ce serait elle qui ferait maintenant l'objet de ces commentaires.\n[33] Le syndicat a propos\u00e9 certains autres postes pouvant \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt, notamment ce qui suit :\nun poste de service, \u00e0 savoir un poste d'aide g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au triage; un poste de service \u00e0 la butte de gravit\u00e9 ; un poste de conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe au triage; un poste de travail s\u00e9dentaire dans un des bureaux de l'administration du CN; un poste dans une \u00e9quipe de trois personnes, puisque ces \u00e9quipes n'utilisaient pas de loco-commandes.\nLe CN a rejet\u00e9 toutes ces propositions.\n[34] Le 1er mars 2002, le CN a \u00e9crit ce qui suit \u00e0 Mme Hoyt :\n[traduction]\nLa compagnie a entrepris un examen des fonctions de remplacement ou des modifications \u00e0 vos fonctions actuelles compte tenu de votre grossesse. Le r\u00e9sultat d'un tel examen est que pour le moment la compagnie n'est pas en mesure de vous fournir un accommodement.\nVos restrictions physiques se situent effectivement dans les param\u00e8tres du poste de chef de train adjoint de l'affection de l'apr\u00e8s-midi \u00e0 la tour ouest au triage Walker, mais votre anciennet\u00e9 ne vous permet pas d'occuper automatiquement ce poste. Pour pouvoir vous affecter \u00e0 un tel poste, la compagnie doit obtenir l'accord du CCSOCF des TUT.\nLa compagnie a discut\u00e9 de l'accommodement avec le syndicat, mais les repr\u00e9sentants n'\u00e9taient pas dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 conclure un accord qui d\u00e9rogerait aux dispositions de la convention collective portant sur l'anciennet\u00e9.\nLa compagnie continuera de chercher d'autres possibilit\u00e9s qui r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 vos restrictions et vous informera en cons\u00e9quence.\nSi vous avez des questions ou si vous avez besoin de renseignements additionnels, veuillez communiquer avec le soussign\u00e9 au [...].\nLa r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au CCSOCG des TUT est une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au syndicat.\n[35] Le cong\u00e9 sans solde de Mme Hoyt s'est poursuivi. Elle a re\u00e7u certaines prestations de maladie au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente.\n[36] Mme Hoyt a \u00e9crit \u00e0 son employeur une lettre dat\u00e9e du 4 mars 2002 par laquelle elle demandait des renseignements. Elle voulait que le CN l'informe quant aux postes envisag\u00e9s pour elle et elle voulait savoir qui serait sa personne-ressource au CN. Elle n'a pas re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande. De plus, Mme Hoyt a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines Canada une plainte par laquelle elle all\u00e9guait que son employeur avait enfreint aux obligations d'accommodement pr\u00e9vues par le Code canadien du travail, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et a particip\u00e9 au processus de grief avec le syndicat.\nC. La troisi\u00e8me offre du CN - Le poste de conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe et la question de la garde d'enfant [37] Le 25 mai 2002, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 sans solde depuis trois mois et demi, le CN a inform\u00e9 la plaignante qu'il avait pour elle un poste de conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe au triage Walker. Elle travaillerait pendant le quart de l'apr\u00e8s-midi du mardi au samedi de chaque semaine \u00e0 compter du 28 mai 2002. Mme Hoyt a imm\u00e9diatement accept\u00e9 ce poste.\n[38] La famille Hoyt avait un enfant de deux ans \u00e0 la maison. Mme Hoyt a expliqu\u00e9 que son horaire, avant que sa grossesse donne lieu \u00e0 un besoin d'accommodement, \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t variable. Elle travaillait selon le tableau de remplacement et elle recevait un avis de deux heures quant \u00e0 ses affectations sur les quarts de jour, d'apr\u00e8s-midi et de nuit. Si son \u00e9poux \u00e9tait au travail, elle appelait des amis et des adolescents du voisinage pour faire garder sa fille. La personne qui gardait se rendait \u00e0 la maison de la famille Hoyt. Sa fille ne s'est jamais fait garder ailleurs qu'\u00e0 la maison.\n[39] Lorsqu'elle a eu connaissance de son nouvel horaire, Mme Hoyt a su qu'elle aurait \u00e0 prendre des dispositions pour faire garder sa fille. Elle savait aussi qu'elle devrait faire garder sa fille tous les samedis \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le poste que son \u00e9poux occupait au CN, compte tenu de son statut d'anciennet\u00e9, faisait en sorte qu'il devait travailler presque tous les samedis.\n[40] En f\u00e9vrier 2002, lorsqu'elle a appris qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte et que son m\u00e9decin l'a inform\u00e9e qu'elle aurait besoin d'un accommodement, Mme Hoyt a tenu pour acquis qu'elle aurait un quart de travail r\u00e9gulier et qu'elle devrait prendre des dispositions pour faire garder son enfant. Elle a communiqu\u00e9 avec une femme d'une ville voisine qui exploitait un service de garde en milieu familial. Cette femme, qui est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 des chemins de fer, connaissait bien le style de vie des familles dont les parents travaillent pour l'industrie des chemins de fer et \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir un accommodement quant aux besoins plut\u00f4t inhabituels en mati\u00e8re de garde d'enfants, acceptant de garder des enfants le jour et la nuit, sept jours par semaine. Mme Hoyt a obtenu une place pour sa fille dans ce service de garde. Elle n'a pas obtenu un accommodement aussi rapidement qu'elle s'y attendait. Lorsqu'elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 ce m\u00eame service de garde \u00e0 la fin de mai, elle a appris qu'il n'\u00e9tait plus possible que sa fille s'y fasse garder.\n[41] Mme Hoyt a pris contact avec d'autres personnes, principalement des adolescents du voisinage qui avaient gard\u00e9 sa fille dans le pass\u00e9. Elle a pu, durant la courte p\u00e9riode du 25 au 28 mai, prendre des dispositions, sauf pour trois samedis en juin.\n[42] Lorsqu'elle est retourn\u00e9e au travail le 28 mai 2002, Mme Hoyt a inform\u00e9 le CN de son probl\u00e8me quant \u00e0 la garde de son enfant. Elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'accommodement que son horaire soit modifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu'elle n'ait pas \u00e0 travailler le samedi pendant ces trois semaines. Le superviseur adjoint, Rick Sherbo, l'a inform\u00e9e qu'il verrait ce qu'il pouvait faire.\n[43] Le 4 juin 2002, Mme Hoyt est retourn\u00e9e au bureau de M. Sherbo afin de voir quelles dispositions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. On l'a inform\u00e9e que le CN lui fournirait un accommodement en lui permettant de prendre des cong\u00e9s sans solde pour ces journ\u00e9es.\n[44] Mme Hoyt a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre contrari\u00e9e. Elle a eu une altercation avec M. Sherbo avant le d\u00e9but de son quart de travail. En quittant le bureau de M. Sherbo, elle a pris conscience qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas apte \u00e0 travailler. Elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s contrari\u00e9e et elle ne se sentait pas capable de conduire de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire le v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe. Elle a quitt\u00e9 le travail et en conduisant vers la maison elle \u00e9tait essouffl\u00e9e et elle a eu certaines douleurs abdominales. Elle \u00e9tait inqui\u00e8te quant \u00e0 sa propre sant\u00e9 et quant \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 de son ftus. Elle avait eu des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 au cours de sa premi\u00e8re grossesse. Elle s'est rendue directement \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en observation, a subi certains tests et a quitt\u00e9 l'h\u00f4pital le m\u00eame jour. Le lendemain, elle s'est rendue chez son m\u00e9decin et il l'a inform\u00e9e que le stress qu'elle continuait \u00e0 subir quant \u00e0 l'accommodement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa grossesse mettait sa sant\u00e9 en danger et pouvait faire du tort \u00e0 son ftus. Le m\u00e9decin lui a ordonn\u00e9 de s'absenter du travail pendant un mois.\n[45] Mme Hoyt est rest\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison comme le m\u00e9decin lui avait ordonn\u00e9 de le faire. Le CN a contest\u00e9 sa demande d'indemnisation des accident\u00e9s du travail et cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Elle a re\u00e7u certaines prestations de maladie.\n[46] Au d\u00e9but de juillet 2002, Mme Hoyt est retourn\u00e9e au travail en tant que conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de service et a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 exercer cette fonction jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle parte en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Son deuxi\u00e8me enfant est n\u00e9 au cours de l'automne 2002.\nIV. ANALYSE [47] L'article 7 de la LCDP \u00e9tablit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu, et de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n[48] Il appartient d'abord au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une fois que le plaignant s'est acquitt\u00e9 de cette t\u00e2che, le fardeau de preuve passe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 qui il appartient d'\u00e9tablir que la mesure adopt\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9cision prise d\u00e9coulait d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e et qu'une mesure d'accommodement constituerait une contrainte excessive (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP).\nA. La plaignante a-t-elle \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe? [49] Une preuve prima facie de discrimination est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9 (O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28).\n[50] La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse constitue de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (paragraphe 3(2) de la LCDP et Brooks c. Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1219).\n[51] Je conclus selon la preuve de la plaignante qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. En particulier, la preuve de la plaignante \u00e9tablit que le CN a refus\u00e9 de continuer de l'employer et que le CN l'a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en se fondant sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n(i) Le refus d'employer ou de continuer d'employer [52] Mme Hoyt \u00e9tait enceinte. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir certaines douleurs et certains malaises au travail. Elle est all\u00e9e consulter son m\u00e9decin. Son m\u00e9decin l'a examin\u00e9e et, dans une lettre, il a donn\u00e9 quatre directives claires et simples. Elle a apport\u00e9 la lettre au CN. On lui a dit de retourner chez elle et on lui a donn\u00e9 un statut d'employ\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 sans solde.\n[53] Le CN a fait deux offres d'accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt en f\u00e9vrier 2002. Mme Hoyt a rejet\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re proposition et le syndicat, avec l'appui de Mme Hoyt, a rejet\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me proposition.\n[54] Les propositions d'accommodement faites par le CN donnent lieu \u00e0 l'analyse effectu\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, au paragraphe 39, qui nous rappelle que lorsqu'un employeur a communiqu\u00e9 une proposition qui fournirait un accommodement complet quant aux besoins ou restrictions d'un employ\u00e9, qui est raisonnable dans les circonstances, l'obligation de l'employeur est remplie. Il appartient alors \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 et, dans un environnement syndiqu\u00e9, au syndicat, d'accepter la proposition et d'en faciliter la mise en application. Si le besoin d'accommodement d'un employ\u00e9 est compl\u00e8tement et correctement satisfait, l'employeur ne sera pas tenu de d\u00e9montrer que l'accommodement \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 une contrainte excessive.\n[55] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 cette question. M. le juge Pelletier, r\u00e9digeant l'opinion commune de la Cour d'appel dans l'arr\u00eat Hutchinson c. Canada (Ministre de l'Environnement), [2003] 4 C.F. 580, au paragraphe 75, a mentionn\u00e9 que lorsqu'il peut \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'un employeur a pris des mesures raisonnables et a fait des propositions raisonnables qui r\u00e9pondraient aux limitations d'un employ\u00e9, l'employ\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 et une preuve prima facie n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[56] J'estime que ni l'une ni l'autre des propositions du CN ne fournissait un accommodement quant aux besoins de Mme Hoyt.\n[57] La premi\u00e8re proposition d'accommodement du CN \u00e9tait directement contraire \u00e0 au moins une des restrictions m\u00e9dicales \u00e9tablies par le m\u00e9decin de Mme Hoyt. Son m\u00e9decin lui avait dit de ne pas utiliser une loco-commande. Le poste exigeait l'utilisation d'une loco-commande. Mme Hoyt croyait de plus que le poste serait ind\u00fbment ardu et ainsi contraire \u00e0 une deuxi\u00e8me des directives de son m\u00e9decin. Cette offre n'\u00e9tait pas d'une nature envisag\u00e9e par l'arr\u00eat Renaud; elle ne fournissait pas un accommodement quant aux restrictions \u00e9tablies par son m\u00e9decin.\n[58] La deuxi\u00e8me proposition d'accommodement du CN ne fournissait pas non plus un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt. Cette proposition, si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en application, m\u00eame si elle respectait toutes les restrictions \u00e9tablies par le m\u00e9decin de Mme Hoyt, donnait lieu \u00e0 d'autres pr\u00e9occupations importantes, \u00e0 savoir : la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l'anciennet\u00e9.\n[59] Le syndicat a adopt\u00e9 la position que suivant cette proposition Mme Hoyt ne serait pas en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans la cour de triage. Mme Hoyt, une chef de train de manuvre exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e, avait \u00e9galement cette pr\u00e9occupation. Les instructions d'op\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du CN exigeaient que les deux chefs de train portent une loco-commande lorsqu'ils travaillaient dans une \u00e9quipe de deux chefs de train. La proposition du CN exempterait seulement Mme Hoyt de cette directive en milieu de travail. Comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est une priorit\u00e9 au CN. Les mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont une partie de l'\u00e9quipement et une partie de la culture de cette industrie. La pr\u00e9occupation quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9tait raisonnable dans les circonstances et repr\u00e9sentait un autre besoin parmi les besoins d'accommodement de Mme Hoyt. Le poste offert ne r\u00e9pondait pas \u00e0 ce besoin et il ne satisfaisait pas compl\u00e8tement les besoins d'accommodement de Mme Hoyt.\n[60] La discrimination peut r\u00e9sulter tant de la conduite qui cr\u00e9e un d\u00e9savantage pratique que des messages qu'une telle conduite peut v\u00e9hiculer (Vriend c. Alberta, [1998] 1 R.C.S. 493, au paragraphe 100). Le message v\u00e9hicul\u00e9 par cette proposition est manifeste. Si elle \u00e9tait mise en application, la proposition signifierait que Mme Hoyt - seulement Mme Hoyt - seulement la femme enceinte - se d\u00e9placerait dans le triage Walker, parmi ses 40 voies ferr\u00e9es, les wagons en mouvement pesant de 30 \u00e0 130 tonnes et s'\u00e9tendant sur un mille de long, sans l'\u00e9quipement et la protection que les instructions d'op\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rales procurent \u00e0 tous les autres employ\u00e9s travaillant dans une \u00e9quipe de deux chefs de train. Le message que la mise en application de cette proposition v\u00e9hiculerait est \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue discriminatoire.\n[61] Cette proposition cr\u00e9ait aussi pour Mme Hoyt une crainte raisonnable d'\u00eatre expos\u00e9e \u00e0 d'autres actes discriminatoires si elle devait obtenir un statut d'anciennet\u00e9 privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. Cette pr\u00e9occupation \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur l'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cemment v\u00e9cue par une coll\u00e8gue qui avait subi de la part de coll\u00e8gues des commentaires inappropri\u00e9s et d'autres m\u00e9faits. Cette pr\u00e9occupation qu'avait Mme Hoyt \u00e9tait un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de son besoin d'accommodement et la deuxi\u00e8me proposition du CN ne satisfaisait pas \u00e0 ce besoin.\n[62] Puisqu'elle avait rejet\u00e9 les offres d'accommodement, Mme Hoyt a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 sans solde pendant trois mois et demi. Mme Hoyt n'\u00e9tait pas malade. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas bless\u00e9e. Elle \u00e9tait une femme enceinte, en sant\u00e9 et au d\u00e9but de sa grossesse. Je conclus que la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Entre la mi-f\u00e9vrier et la fin de mai 2002, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination puisqu'elle n'a pas obtenu un accommodement ad\u00e9quat quant \u00e0 sa grossesse.\n(ii) Le fait d'\u00eatre d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi [63] Il existe de plus des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que Mme Hoyt a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi par rapport \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s qui n'avaient pas la m\u00eame caract\u00e9ristique qu'elle avait, soit \u00eatre enceinte.\n[64] Marvin Sawatzky a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors de l'audience. M. Sawatzky, un chef de train du CN et un m\u00e9canicien de locomotive, s'est bless\u00e9 \u00e0 la cheville trois jours avant que Mme Hoyt pr\u00e9sente sa demande d'accommodement. M. Sawatzky a obtenu une note de son m\u00e9decin, l'a apport\u00e9e au CN et on lui a dit de se pr\u00e9senter au travail le lendemain. Il a d'abord travaill\u00e9 dans le bureau de l'administration, puis on lui a donn\u00e9 un poste de conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe. Son quart de travail \u00e9tait du lundi au vendredi et commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 7 h 30. M. Sawatzky \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 pour tout le quart de travail m\u00eame s'il quittait le lieu de travail apr\u00e8s le repas du midi tous les jours pour aller faire de la physioth\u00e9rapie. Il retournait \u00e0 la maison apr\u00e8s son rendez-vous. M. Sawatzky est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son emploi habituel au d\u00e9but de mai.\n[65] L'\u00e9poux de Mme Hoyt, qui travaillait en tant que chef de train au CN, parmi d'autres emplois occup\u00e9s chez cet employeur, est devenu incapable d'utiliser une loco-commande neuf jours apr\u00e8s qu'est n\u00e9 le besoin d'accommodement de Mme Hoyt. M. Hoyt avait des maux de dos caus\u00e9s par le harnais de la loco-commande. Comme M. Sawatzky, M. Hoyt a remis au CN une note du m\u00e9decin qui exposait son besoin d'accommodement. On lui a dit de se pr\u00e9senter au travail le lendemain matin. M. Hoyt s'est joint \u00e0 M. Swatzky dans un bureau de l'administration sur le triage et il a fait du travail administratif. Il a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste dans la zone de protection qui comportait la manuvre d'une locomotive dans une \u00e9quipe de trois personnes. Les \u00e9quipes de trois personnes n'utilisent pas de loco-commandes. Il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste habituel au d\u00e9but d'avril 2002 apr\u00e8s que le CN eut r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire des ajustements \u00e0 son harnais. M. Hoyt n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9quipe de deux chefs de train dans laquelle il devait utiliser une radio plut\u00f4t qu'une loco-commande.\n[66] Le CN ne pouvait pas, cependant, trouver pour Mme Hoyt un accommodement autre que ce qu'il avait propos\u00e9. Elle restait \u00e0 la maison.\n[67] Cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement elle-m\u00eame \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination (Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) c. Canadian Odeon Theatres Ltd. (1985), 6 C.H.R.R. D\/2682, \u00e0 D\/2689). L'omission du CN d'avoir fourni un accommodement raisonnable \u00e0 Mme Hoyt entre la mi-f\u00e9vrier et la fin de mai 2002, en particulier alors que d'autres employ\u00e9s ont obtenu des mesures d'accommodement sans peine, est suffisante pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Il appartient maintenant au CN de justifier sa conduite selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\nB. La justification du CN [68] Le CN justifie sa conduite en disant qu'il a fait une proposition d'accommodement raisonnable satisfaisant \u00e0 son obligation pr\u00e9vue par la loi de fournir un accommodement et que Mme Hoyt et le syndicat ne se sont pas acquitt\u00e9s de leur obligation d'accepter l'accommodement raisonnable. Le syndicat \u00e9tait de plus fautif parce qu'il n'a pas communiqu\u00e9 son rejet de la proposition avant la fin d'avril 2002. Finalement, il n'y avait pas au CN d'autres postes disponibles qui auraient pu \u00eatre offerts \u00e0 Mme Hoyt jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le poste de conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe devienne disponible. La preuve du CN \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question de la justification est la suivante :\n[69] Les objectifs du CN lorsqu'il a trait\u00e9 la demande d'accommodement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Hoyt comportaient deux volets. Premi\u00e8rement, le CN pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait que ses employ\u00e9s continuent dans la mesure du possible \u00e0 exercer le m\u00e9tier qu'ils exercent habituellement. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le CN pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait que ses employ\u00e9s occupent des postes d'accommodement viables, c'est-\u00e0-dire des postes utiles aux op\u00e9rations du CN.\n[70] Lorsque, au d\u00e9part, le CN a re\u00e7u la demande d'accommodement de la plaignante et la note du m\u00e9decin, le superviseur adjoint du CN, Rick Sherbo, s'est renseign\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s d'autres services du CN afin de voir s'ils avaient des postes disponibles pour une femme enceinte. Il n'a rien trouv\u00e9. \u00c0 ce moment, le CN r\u00e9duisait le nombre de ses postes administratifs et il avait \u00e9limin\u00e9 peu auparavant certains postes cr\u00e9\u00e9s pour fournir un accommodement \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il avait jug\u00e9 que ces postes n'avaient aucune utilit\u00e9 pour la compagnie.\n[71] M. Sherbo a remis la note du m\u00e9decin \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur, M. Valliere. M. Valliere et M. Sherbo \u00e9taient d'avis que l'utilisation de la loco-commande ne pr\u00e9sentait aucune inqui\u00e9tude sur le plan m\u00e9dical pour une femme enceinte. De plus, les restrictions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des dangers et des activit\u00e9s trop ardues n'\u00e9taient pas claires pour les deux hommes. Ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'offrir \u00e0 Mme Hoyt un poste comportant l'utilisation d'une loco-commande \u00e0 la butte du triage Walker. Ils estimaient que ce poste serait moins ardu qu'un poste dans le triage. Ils ont de plus d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de demander au m\u00e9decin de Mme Hoyt des \u00e9claircissements \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses restrictions. Ce poste r\u00e9pondait aux objectifs d'accommodement du CN.\n[72] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la deuxi\u00e8me note du m\u00e9decin, M. Sherbo et M. Valliere ont discut\u00e9 de nouveau de l'affaire. Le deuxi\u00e8me poste, celui que Mme Hoyt occuperait dans une \u00e9quipe de deux chefs de train sans porter une loco-commande, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transform\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 satisfaire aux objectifs d'accommodement du CN et aux restrictions \u00e9tablies par le m\u00e9decin. M. Sherbo a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 comme suit : [traduction] C'est fondamentalement ce \u00e0 quoi nous sommes arriv\u00e9s comme accommodement viable. Le CN a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cette proposition au syndicat. Le syndicat, comme nous le savons, a rejet\u00e9 cette proposition.\n[73] M. Sherbo a alors \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Hoyt la lettre du 1er mars 2002 l'informant que le syndicat avait rejet\u00e9 la proposition d'accommodement du CN et qu'il n'y avait pas au CN d'autres postes disponibles pour lui fournir un accommodement quant \u00e0 sa grossesse.\n[74] Les autres solutions propos\u00e9es par le syndicat ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es parce que selon le CN elles n'\u00e9taient pas viables.\n[75] M. Sherbo a dit qu'il a continu\u00e9, de temps \u00e0 autre, \u00e0 se renseigner \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des postes disponibles. Il n'en a trouv\u00e9 aucun. Il a de plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s le 1er mars 2002, l'affaire [traduction] est mont\u00e9e \u00e0 l'autre \u00e9tage. Il n'\u00e9tait pas au courant des d\u00e9cisions prises ou du raisonnement du CN \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des d\u00e9cisions prises apr\u00e8s cette date.\n[76] \u00c0 la mi-mars 2002, un mois apr\u00e8s que Mme Hoyt a fait sa premi\u00e8re demande d'accommodement et un mois apr\u00e8s qu'on l'a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison en cong\u00e9 sans solde, Susan Blackmore, une agente de ressources humaines du CN, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'occuper du dossier. Le CN demandait \u00e0 Mme Blackmore de tenter de convaincre le syndicat de changer d'id\u00e9e et de consentir \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me proposition d'accommodement. Le CN estimait que l'accommodement \u00e9tait une solution bonne et viable. Elle a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 un repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat et a fait un suivi par de la correspondance dans laquelle elle demandait une r\u00e9ponse. Mme Blackmore a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait bon espoir que le syndicat modifie sa position et que, m\u00eame si elle attendait une r\u00e9ponse, elle s'\u00e9tait renseign\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on non officielle aupr\u00e8s d'autres services afin de voir s'il y avait des postes disponibles. Elle n'a trouv\u00e9 aucun poste pour Mme Hoyt. Mme Blackmore a expliqu\u00e9 que [traduction] au CN, les postes offrant un accommodement sont limit\u00e9s. \u00c0 la fin d'avril, le syndicat a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on officielle au nom de Mme Hoyt un grief de principe. Mme Blackmore a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ce n'est qu'\u00e0 ce moment qu'elle a pris conscience que le syndicat ne modifierait pas sa position.\n[77] \u00c0 la fin de mai 2002, on a offert \u00e0 Mme Hoyt le poste de conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe. Les t\u00e9moins du CN ne savaient pas quand le poste de conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe \u00e9tait devenu disponible ni la raison pour laquelle il \u00e9tait disponible. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par M. Valliere. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin.\nC. La conduite du CN \u00e9tait-elle justifi\u00e9e? S'agissait-il d'une EPJ? [78] L'article 15 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que la conduite d'un employeur, si elle est fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ), ne sera pas un acte discriminatoire.\n[79] Pour satisfaire au fardeau de preuve, un employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il s'est acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation de fournir un accommodement raisonnable \u00e0 moins que cela cause une contrainte excessive (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpson Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, voir \u00e9galement Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) (1990), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/417).\n[80] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans l'arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union (B.C.G.S.E.U.) (Grief Meiorin), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), expose l'obligation d'accommodement d'un employeur et l'analyse selon laquelle les efforts d'un employeur doivent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s.\n[81] Pour \u00e9tablir cette justification, \u00e0 savoir l'existence d'une EPJ, l'employeur doit prouver ce qui suit :\nqu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme ou pris la d\u00e9cision dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 58); qu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme ou pris la d\u00e9cision en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 60); que la norme adopt\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9cision prise \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 62).\n(i) Le lien rationnel [82] Pour satisfaire au premier volet du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, l'employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'une d\u00e9cision prise est rationnellement li\u00e9e au travail en cause. L'accent dans cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape ne porte pas sur la validit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cisions particuli\u00e8res qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises, mais plut\u00f4t sur la validit\u00e9 d'une fin plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[83] Les d\u00e9cisions prises par le CN lorsqu'il a tent\u00e9 de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d'abord de l'envoyer chez elle en cong\u00e9 sans solde jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la note du m\u00e9decin soit prise en compte, puis de lui offrir un poste \u00e0 la butte du triage Walker et ensuite de lui offrir au triage un poste de chef de train dans lequel elle ne porterait pas de loco-commande. Le CN n'a pas pu trouver d'autres postes pour fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de mai 2002.\n[84] Le CN a donn\u00e9 deux raisons quant aux d\u00e9cisions prises \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt. Le CN pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait que ses employ\u00e9s continuent \u00e0 exercer le m\u00e9tier qu'ils exercent habituellement lorsque cela \u00e9tait raisonnablement possible. Le CN pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait de plus que ses employ\u00e9s occupent des postes viables, c'est-\u00e0-dire des postes utiles \u00e0 ses op\u00e9rations.\n[85] Je conclus que dans l'ensemble ces objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, \u00e0 savoir la volont\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s continuent \u00e0 exercer le m\u00e9tier qu'ils exercent habituellement et la viabilit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique, sont raisonnables et que les d\u00e9cisions sont rationnellement li\u00e9es aux objectifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par le CN.\n(ii) La croyance sinc\u00e8re [86] La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin est l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment subjectif du crit\u00e8re. L'employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de son objet. L'employeur doit en outre d\u00e9montrer qu'il a agi sans qu'il ait eu l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le demandeur (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 60).\n[87] Je conclus que le CN ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau \u00e0 cette deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l'analyse.\n[88] Le CN est un employeur important et averti. Le CN a un service de la gestion du risque et un service de ressources humaines qui comptent de nombreux employ\u00e9s qui s'occupent sur une base quotidienne des questions se rapportant \u00e0 l'accommodement. Les employ\u00e9s du service des ressources humaines repr\u00e9sentent leur employeur lors des arbitrages de griefs sur le lieu de travail, r\u00e9pondent aux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par les employ\u00e9s en vertu du Code canadien du travail et aux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de la LCDP. Le CN a beaucoup de ressources et il est appropri\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer que cet employeur comprend le contenu de son obligation de fournir un accommodement selon ce que pr\u00e9voient les lois et selon la formulation du Tribunal et de nos cours de justice.\n[89] Le CN a en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement des politiques qui formulent de fa\u00e7on raisonnable, quoique peu en profondeur, le contenu de l'obligation d'accommodement et qui exposent les proc\u00e9dures devant \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es par les chefs hi\u00e9rarchiques du CN lorsqu'ils examinent les demandes d'accommodement. Le CN a omis de suivre une grande partie de sa propre politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement lorsqu'il a trait\u00e9 la demande d'accommodement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Hoyt.\n[90] Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, je conclus que le CN ne croyait pas que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire et qu'il ne croyait pas qu'il n'exer\u00e7ait pas de la discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Hoyt dans ses efforts d'accommodement ou qu'il croyait de fa\u00e7on inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e qu'il ne le faisait pas.\n[91] Comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, les offres d'accommodement faites \u00e0 Mme Hoyt ne r\u00e9pondaient pas \u00e0 son besoin d'accommodement. En outre, comme je l'expliquerai plus en d\u00e9tail ci-apr\u00e8s, les efforts du CN pour fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt \u00e9taient cruellement loin de son obligation de lui fournir un accommodement, comme cette obligation est examin\u00e9e \u00e0 fond, ci-apr\u00e8s et ne suivent pas ad\u00e9quatement sa propre politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement. Le CN savait ou devait savoir qu'il se livrait \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire. Le CN n'a pas satisfait \u00e0 ce deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re.\n(iii) La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 raisonnable [92] La troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin exige que l'employeur d\u00e9montre, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la ou les d\u00e9cisions prises sont raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de ses objectifs li\u00e9s au travail. La d\u00e9cision sera raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire si l'employeur peut d\u00e9montrer qu'il ne peut pas fournir un accommodement \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 sans subir une contrainte excessive (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 62, voir \u00e9galement Hutchinson, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 70, et Audet c. CN, 2006 TCDP 25, au paragraphe 50).\n[93] Le CN a fait deux propositions d'accommodement qui serviraient son objectif selon lequel Mme Hoyt continuerait \u00e0 exercer le m\u00e9tier qu'elle exerce habituellement et celui selon lequel elle occuperait un poste utile aux op\u00e9rations du CN. J'ai conclu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment qu'aucune de ces propositions ne r\u00e9pondait aux besoins d'accommodement raisonnables de Mme Hoyt. La premi\u00e8re proposition ne satisfaisait pas aux restrictions m\u00e9dicales \u00e9tablies par son m\u00e9decin. La deuxi\u00e8me proposition soulevait des pr\u00e9occupations importantes quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et une pr\u00e9occupation selon laquelle le fait d'accorder \u00e0 Mme Hoyt un statut d'anciennet\u00e9 privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e lui ferait subir encore plus de discrimination. Le syndicat a rejet\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on raisonnable cette proposition.\n[94] Le CN a conclu qu'il ne pouvait offrir aucun autre poste \u00e0 Mme Hoyt et que cette derni\u00e8re resterait chez elle en cong\u00e9 sans solde. Cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait-elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire au sens envisag\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin? J'estime qu'elle ne l'\u00e9tait pas.\n[95] Il faut d'abord, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re, examiner le processus adopt\u00e9 pour \u00e9valuer la question de l'accommodement, puis examiner la teneur r\u00e9elle de la d\u00e9cision rendue (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 66).\n[96] Un employeur doit d\u00e9montrer que le processus adopt\u00e9 pour \u00e9valuer la question de l'accommodement \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9. Un employeur doit \u00eatre soucieux et respectueux des aptitudes, des capacit\u00e9s et de l'apport potentiel des employ\u00e9s qui ont besoin d'accommodement (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 64, et voir \u00e9galement Audet, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 51); un employeur doit, en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement, examiner en profondeur des m\u00e9thodes de rechange qui pourraient \u00eatre moins discriminatoires, et d\u00e9montrer que toute m\u00e9thode de rechange examin\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e pour des motifs appropri\u00e9s (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 65, et voir \u00e9galement Audet, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 62); un employeur doit \u00eatre innovateur tout en \u00e9tant pratique lorsqu'il \u00e9value des questions d'accommodement. Je conclus que le CN n'a pas respect\u00e9 ces exigences du processus.\n[97] Je conclus que le CN n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soucieux ou respectueux des aptitudes, des capacit\u00e9s et de l'apport potentiel de Mme Hoyt. Le CN n'a pas pris de mesures visant \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir les aptitudes et capacit\u00e9s r\u00e9elles de Mme Hoyt. Le CN n'a m\u00eame pas rencontr\u00e9 Mme Hoyt d'une mani\u00e8re constructive au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, m\u00eame si sa propre politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement pr\u00e9voit comme premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du processus une rencontre avec l'employ\u00e9. Le CN n'a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 aucun profil d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des aptitudes et capacit\u00e9s de Mme Hoyt pour l'assister dans son examen. Mme Hoyt \u00e9tait une femme en bonne sant\u00e9 qui avait beaucoup \u00e0 offrir \u00e0 son employeur. Nous savons qu'elle avait de l'exp\u00e9rience en soudure et, parce qu'elle travaillait depuis longtemps pour le CN, elle connaissait tr\u00e8s bien les op\u00e9rations du CN. Quelles autres aptitudes et capacit\u00e9s pouvait-elle avoir? Cette \u00e9tape de collecte de renseignements est cruciale dans le processus d'accommodement et le CN n'en a pas tenu compte. Il est peu probable que, sans avoir une v\u00e9ritable appr\u00e9ciation de qui \u00e9tait Mme Hoyt et de ce qu'elle pouvait faire pour aider la compagnie, un employeur soit correctement capable de s'occuper de ses autres obligations proc\u00e9durales.\n[98] Je conclus que le CN n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il avait examin\u00e9 en profondeur toutes les m\u00e9thodes de rechange en vue de l'accommodement \u00e0 offrir \u00e0 Mme Hoyt. Le CN n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il avait lui-m\u00eame g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 et examin\u00e9 quelque autre possibilit\u00e9 aux propositions faites, et ce malgr\u00e9 les directives contenues dans sa propre politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement pr\u00e9voyant qu'il devait se renseigner, examiner en d\u00e9tail d'autres possibilit\u00e9s et conserver des dossiers \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de chaque \u00e9tape du processus. Aucun dossier n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve. En outre, le CN a rejet\u00e9 les propositions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par le syndicat. Certains des postes propos\u00e9s auraient permis \u00e0 Mme Hoyt de continuer \u00e0 exercer le m\u00e9tier qu'elle exer\u00e7ait habituellement ou d'occuper un poste assez \u00e9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 son m\u00e9tier et auraient ainsi satisfait au premier objectif du CN en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement. La raison pour laquelle le CN a rejet\u00e9 ces propositions \u00e9tait qu'\u00e0 son avis elles n'\u00e9taient pas viables. Le CN n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'il a examin\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail chacune des propositions ou qu'il a examin\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail les co\u00fbts de mise en application de l'une ou l'autre de ces propositions; il n'a pas non plus pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que le co\u00fbt serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9. Le CN n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que son rejet des propositions du syndicat \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur des facteurs appropri\u00e9s.\n[99] Les efforts faits par le CN pour fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt, autres que les deux propositions dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment trait\u00e9, se limitaient \u00e0 des demandes de renseignements faites par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Contrairement \u00e0 la directive contenue dans la politique du CN en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement, aucun dossier n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu quant \u00e0 ces demandes et nous ne pouvons donc pas conna\u00eetre l'\u00e9tendue, la profondeur et la pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance des recherches \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Mme Blackmore a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle s'est renseign\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s d'autres services par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone apr\u00e8s qu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'occuper de l'affaire \u00e0 la mi-mars 2002. M. Sherbo a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lui aussi avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 divers services du CN pour tenter de trouver un poste pouvant r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une employ\u00e9e [traduction] qui \u00e9tait enceinte. Il avait aussi fait \u00e0 l'occasion de telles demandes de renseignements en personne. Ce type de recherche non officielle est loin de l'obligation \u00e9tablie dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin. Ce type de recherche est de plus humiliant pour Mme Hoyt et met en \u00e9vidence l'importance de l'\u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire de collecte de renseignements et de son lien crucial avec la protection de la dignit\u00e9 humaine.\n[100] Le CN essayait, par ces demandes de renseignements par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, de trouver des postes disponibles, c'est-\u00e0-dire des postes \u00e0 pourvoir, adoptant la position que s'il n'y avait pas de postes \u00e0 pourvoir le CN \u00e9tait incapable d'offrir un accommodement \u00e0 un employ\u00e9.\n[101] Bien que ce point de vue tr\u00e8s \u00e9troit quant \u00e0 une recherche de postes d'accommodement r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 l'objectif de viabilit\u00e9 du CN quant au travail, il ne satisfait pas, \u00e0 lui seul, \u00e0 son obligation de fournir un accommodement. La juge McLachlin fait remarquer dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin qu'[i]l peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al, du point de vue de l'employeur, de choisir une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue. Elle explique ensuite, cependant, que pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne la norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 62). Le CN n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ce point de vue \u00e9troit \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'accommodement \u00e9tait le mieux qu'il puisse faire sans subir de contrainte excessive.\n[102] Les employeurs doivent \u00eatre innovateurs dans leur recherche de l'accommodement \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 un employ\u00e9. Ils doivent faire preuve de flexibilit\u00e9 et de cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9. Le CN n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il avait fait de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e de l'innovation ou qu'il avait fait preuve de flexibilit\u00e9 ou de cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9.\n[103] J'estime que la d\u00e9cision Saunders c. Kentville (Town), [2004] N.S.H.R.B.I.D. no 9, est riche en renseignements. Dans cette affaire, une commission d'enqu\u00eate de Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse examinait la plainte formul\u00e9e par une polici\u00e8re qui all\u00e9guait que son d\u00e9tachement ne lui avait pas fourni un accommodement du fait de son sexe et de sa grossesse. Le pr\u00e9sident Deveau a utilis\u00e9 l'analyse \u00e9tablie dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin dans le contexte d'un petit service de police en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. Le pr\u00e9sident a conclu que, m\u00eame s'il s'agissait d'un petit service de 12 \u00e0 14 employ\u00e9s, et m\u00eame si l'accommodement \u00e9tait peu commode, l'employeur ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation de fournir un accommodement \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il a fait peu d'efforts visant \u00e0 regrouper un certain nombre de t\u00e2ches et de fonctions sur une base temporaire pour trouver une fa\u00e7on de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 la plaignante. Le pr\u00e9sident a conclu que l'employeur avait une obligation d'\u00e9tudier \u00e0 fond pleinement et compl\u00e8tement les possibilit\u00e9s de fonctions l\u00e9g\u00e8res dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne causait pas une contrainte excessive. L'employeur n'avait pas prouv\u00e9 que c'est ce qu'il avait fait.\n[104] Le CN est une entreprise beaucoup plus grande. Le CN avait environ 100 employ\u00e9s qui travaillaient sur le terrain de triage au terminal d'Edmonton au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente et environ 200 autres employ\u00e9s qui travaillaient \u00e0 l'\u00e9difice administratif du centre-ville. Avec un si grand nombre de fonctions professionnelles exerc\u00e9es \u00e0 partir du terminal d'Edmonton, un employeur faisant correctement preuve d'innovation et de flexibilit\u00e9 pourrait s\u00fbrement tenter de cr\u00e9er, modifier ou r\u00e9am\u00e9nager une ou plusieurs fonctions professionnelles pour fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt d'une mani\u00e8re r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 ses objectifs li\u00e9s au travail. Le CN n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'il avait fait ce type de recherche.\n[105] Allant au-del\u00e0 du processus utilis\u00e9 par le CN dans son examen de l'accommodement \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 Mme Hoyt et voyant la teneur des d\u00e9cisions rendues, il est clair que le CN n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ses d\u00e9cisions \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9es selon la mani\u00e8re envisag\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin. Le CN n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve donnant \u00e0 penser qu'il subirait une contrainte excessive en offrant \u00e0 Mme Hoyt un poste de remplacement \u00e0 titre d'accommodement. Comme le Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment fait remarquer, un employeur doit d\u00e9montrer d'une mani\u00e8re r\u00e9elle et concr\u00e8te qu'il existe une contrainte excessive (Audet, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 106). Je conclus que le CN n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que lorsqu'il a re\u00e7u la premi\u00e8re demande d'accommodement faite par Mme Hoyt il \u00e9tait impossible de lui trouver un autre poste le lendemain, comme il l'a fait pour M. Sawatzky et pour M. Hoyt.\n[106] Le CN ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau de preuve pr\u00e9vu par l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la LCDP; il n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il lui serait impossible de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt qui tiendrait compte de sa grossesse sans subir une contrainte excessive.\nD. Le syndicat a-t-il entrav\u00e9 les tentatives faites par le CN en vue de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt? [107] Le CN all\u00e8gue dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions que le syndicat a entrav\u00e9 ses tentatives visant \u00e0 fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt. Premi\u00e8rement, le syndicat a refus\u00e9 de donner son consentement quant \u00e0 un poste de chef de train dans une \u00e9quipe de deux chefs de train dont un seul utiliserait une loco-commande. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le syndicat n'a pas communiqu\u00e9 sa position avant le mois d'avril 2002 et, en cons\u00e9quence, l'accommodement pouvant \u00eatre offert \u00e0 Mme Hoyt a \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9.\n[108] J'estime que le syndicat n'a pas entrav\u00e9 les efforts d'accommodement. Premi\u00e8rement, le syndicat n'a pas agi de mani\u00e8re incorrecte en rejetant l'accommodement propos\u00e9 par le CN. J'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment que les pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et quant \u00e0 l'anciennet\u00e9 exprim\u00e9es par le syndicat et partag\u00e9es par Mme Hoyt \u00e9taient des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de ses besoins d'accommodement raisonnables. Dans ces circonstances, le rejet du syndicat de l'accommodement propos\u00e9 par le CN n'\u00e9tait pas incorrect. En outre, l'obligation du syndicat de faciliter l'accommodement ne na\u00eet que lorsque sa participation est n\u00e9cessaire pour rendre l'accommodement possible et qu'aucune autre solution raisonnable n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e ou n'aurait pu raisonnablement \u00eatre trouv\u00e9e (Renaud, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 50). J'ai conclu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment que le CN n'avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait aucun autre poste qui aurait pu \u00eatre offert \u00e0 Mme Hoyt.\n[109] Je conclus de plus, selon la preuve, que le syndicat n'a pas entrav\u00e9 la tentative d'accommodement faite par le CN en tardant \u00e0 communiquer sa position au CN. Le syndicat a raisonnablement rejet\u00e9, sans d\u00e9lai et \u00e0 plus d'une reprise, la deuxi\u00e8me offre d'accommodement faite par le CN. Le syndicat, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de plus d'un de ses repr\u00e9sentants, a rejet\u00e9 la proposition du CN le 26 f\u00e9vrier, le 28 f\u00e9vrier et le 1er mars 2002. Le syndicat a fait plusieurs propositions quant \u00e0 d'autres postes qui auraient pu \u00eatre offerts \u00e0 Mme Hoyt. Le CN a rejet\u00e9 toutes les propositions faites par le syndicat. Le CN n'a pris aucune autre mesure en vue de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt avant la fin de mai 2002. J'ai pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment conclu que le CN n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait pas rapidement fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt. Elle aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre de retour au travail.\n[110] Environ un mois apr\u00e8s que Mme Hoyt a demand\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois un accommodement, le CN a engag\u00e9 Mme Blackmore pour essayer de convaincre le syndicat de changer d'id\u00e9e. Mme Blackmore a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait compris que le syndicat examinait sa demande et qu'elle esp\u00e9rait qu'il changerait d'id\u00e9e. Mme Blackmore et le CN ont attendu. Mme Hoyt est rest\u00e9e chez elle.\n[111] La preuve du syndicat \u00e9tait que sa position selon laquelle il n'\u00e9tait pas s\u00e9curitaire que dans une \u00e9quipe de deux chefs de train un seul utilise une loco-commande \u00e9tait une position qui datait de longtemps et, de plus, qu'il n'avait jamais song\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier sa position en ce qui concerne l'accommodement propos\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Hoyt. La preuve du syndicat est que le d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant qu'il r\u00e9ponde aux demandes de Mme Blackmore d\u00e9pendait du fait qu'il cherchait des renseignements additionnels avant de finaliser son grief.\n[112] Le CN pr\u00e9tend que c'est le d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant que le syndicat r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 la demande de reconsid\u00e9rer sa position pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Blackmore qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt ou qui y a contribu\u00e9.\n[113] La preuve du CN selon laquelle il pensait que le syndicat pouvait se laisser convaincre de modifier sa position et examinait en fait une telle modification \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'accommodement de Mme Hoyt semble quelque peu trompeuse compte tenu de l'historique de l'affaire. Le syndicat rejetait depuis longtemps la position du CN \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En outre, les repr\u00e9sentants du syndicat ont rejet\u00e9 clairement la proposition \u00e0 trois reprises entre le 26 f\u00e9vrier et le 1er mars 2002.\n[114] Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je tire une conclusion quant \u00e0 savoir si le CN croyait sinc\u00e8rement que le syndicat, entre la mi-mars et la fin d'avril, examinait la possibilit\u00e9 de modifier sa position. J'ai conclu que cette proposition n'\u00e9tait ni raisonnable ni n\u00e9cessairement raisonnable. J'ai de plus conclu que le CN le savait ou devait le savoir. Mme Hoyt aurait d\u00fb obtenir un accommodement bien avant que Mme Blackmore commence \u00e0 s'occuper de l'affaire \u00e0 la mi-mars, plus d'un mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du cong\u00e9 sans solde de Mme Hoyt.\n[115] Je conclus que le syndicat n'a pas entrav\u00e9 les efforts d'accommodement faits par le CN.\nE. La plaignante a-t-elle \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille? [116] \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard d'un individu, suivant la LCDP, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait [...] de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi (alin\u00e9a 7b)). Mme Hoyt all\u00e8gue qu'en plus de subir de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, elle a subi de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille.\n[117] La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur ce motif a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie par la jurisprudence comme s'entendant de [...] mesures ou d'attitudes qui ont pour effet de limiter les conditions d'embauche ou les perspectives d'emploi des employ\u00e9s sur la base d'une caract\u00e9ristique li\u00e9e \u00e0 leur [...] famille (Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) c. M. A et al, [2000] O.J. no 4275 (C.A.); confirm\u00e9 par [2002] A.C.S. no 67].\n[118] Dans une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'affaire Ontario, mais clairement conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition qu'on y retrouve, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 les exigences en mati\u00e8re de preuve qui permettent d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie :\n[...] la preuve doit indiquer que la situation de famille comprend le fait d'\u00eatre parent et les t\u00e2ches et obligations de cette personne comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la plaignante \u00e9tait un parent qui devait remplir ces t\u00e2ches et obligations. La preuve doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que, en raison de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations ainsi que de la r\u00e8gle de l'emploi impartial, la plaignante n'a pas eu de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res (Brown c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national, Douanes et Accise), [1993] D.C.D.P. no 7, \u00e0 la page 13). (Voir \u00e9galement Woiden et al c. Dan Lynn, D.T. 09\/02)\n[119] La Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique, dans l'arr\u00eat Health Sciences Assn. of British Columbia c. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, [2004] B.C.J. no 922, a formul\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente la preuve n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie. La Cour d'appel a statu\u00e9 que les param\u00e8tres de la situation de famille en tant que motif de discrimination dans le code en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique ne doivent pas \u00eatre \u00e9tablis de fa\u00e7on trop large puisque cela pourrait causer [traduction] de la perturbation ou des torts s\u00e9rieux sur le lieu de travail. La Cour a indiqu\u00e9 qu'une preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie [traduction] lorsqu'une modification d'une condition d'emploi impos\u00e9e par un employeur entra\u00eene une perturbation grave \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une importante obligation parentale ou autre obligation familiale de l'employ\u00e9. Le juge Low a fait remarquer que la preuve prima facie serait difficile \u00e0 \u00e9tablir dans des cas de conflit entre les exigences de travail et les obligations familiales.\n[120] Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l'analyse de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique. Les codes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, en raison de leur statut de loi fondamentale, doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on lib\u00e9rale afin qu'ils puissent mieux r\u00e9aliser leurs objectifs (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 547, Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, aux pages 1134 \u00e0 1136; Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, aux pages 89 et 90). Il serait, \u00e0 mon avis, inappropri\u00e9 de choisir un motif de distinction illicite et de lui donner une d\u00e9finition plus restrictive.\n[121] \u00c0 mon humble avis, les pr\u00e9occupations d\u00e9finies par la Cour d'appel, \u00e0 savoir la perturbation grave et les torts s\u00e9rieux sur le lieu de travail, peuvent \u00eatre des questions appropri\u00e9es \u00e0 examiner suivant l'analyse de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, et en particulier suivant le troisi\u00e8me volet de l'analyse, \u00e0 savoir la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 raisonnable. Dans le contexte de l'\u00e9valuation de l'importance de la contrainte, il se peut qu'une mesure d'accommodement donne lieu \u00e0 des questions comme la perturbation grave sur le lieu de travail et l'effet grave sur le moral des employ\u00e9s, qui sont des facteurs appropri\u00e9s (voir l'arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 489, aux pages 520 et 521). Il appartient \u00e0 l'employeur d'\u00e9tablir au cas par cas l'existence d'une contrainte excessive. Une simple crainte que la mesure d'accommodement entra\u00eenerait une contrainte excessive n'est pas un motif appropri\u00e9, \u00e0 mon humble avis, pour \u00e9carter l'analyse.\n[122] La preuve particuli\u00e8rement pertinente quant \u00e0 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la plainte na\u00eet au moment o\u00f9 on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Hoyt le poste de conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe \u00e0 la fin de mai 2002. Cependant, ces faits font partie de l'ensemble de la situation et ne constituent pas une plainte distincte. Pour bien comprendre l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de la plainte qui porte sur la situation de famille, il faut consid\u00e9rer que les faits pertinents quant \u00e0 cette deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation font partie des relations continues entre Mme Hoyt et le CN relativement \u00e0 la question de sa demande d'accommodement ant\u00e9rieure.\n[123] Mme Hoyt avait trouv\u00e9 un service de garde pour sa fille en f\u00e9vrier, puisqu'elle s'attendait \u00e0 ce que le CN lui fournisse rapidement un accommodement quant aux restrictions \u00e9tablies par son m\u00e9decin. Elle a trouv\u00e9 un service de garde qui pouvait r\u00e9pondre aux besoins inhabituels des employ\u00e9s des chemins de fer. Le CN ne lui a pas fourni un accommodement rapidement. Lorsque le CN lui a finalement t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 le 25 mai pour lui dire de se pr\u00e9senter au travail le 28 mai, Mme Hoyt a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 ce service de garde et elle a appris qu'il n'y avait plus de places disponibles. Elle a appel\u00e9 d'autres personnes, principalement des adolescents du voisinage, qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 engag\u00e9es pour garder son enfant. Ces adolescents n'\u00e9taient pas disponibles puisqu'ils \u00e9taient \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole durant la semaine, jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de juin. Au cours du pr\u00e9avis de trois jours re\u00e7u du CN, elle a pu prendre des dispositions pour faire garder sa fille, sauf pour trois samedis en juin.\n[124] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle n'avait pas fait une recherche plus syst\u00e9matique quant \u00e0 un service de garde, Mme Hoyt a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile de trouver un service de garde ouvert le samedi ou aussi tard qu'elle aurait besoin, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un quart de travail d'apr\u00e8s-midi qui n\u00e9cessitait qu'elle travaille de 15 h \u00e0 23 h. De plus, elle a expliqu\u00e9 que m\u00eame si elle avait pu trouver un service de garde, il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de faire les v\u00e9rifications appropri\u00e9es ou de prendre le temps de se familiariser avec le service de garde et d'habituer sa fille \u00e0 le fr\u00e9quenter. Sa fille \u00e2g\u00e9e de deux ans, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9, ne s'\u00e9tait jamais fait garder ailleurs que dans sa propre maison et Mme Hoyt ne voulait pas la placer abruptement dans un lieu qu'elle ne connaissait pas avec des gens qu'elle ne connaissait pas.\n[125] Lorsqu'elle a demand\u00e9 un accommodement, et en particulier lorsqu'elle a demand\u00e9 de travailler pendant un quart de travail qui lui permettrait d'\u00e9viter de travailler les samedis de ces trois semaines, le CN a rejet\u00e9 la proposition. Le CN l'a inform\u00e9e qu'il lui permettrait de prendre des cong\u00e9s sans solde pour ces trois samedis.\n[126] Le CN semble nier que Mme Hoyt ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi. Le CN a une politique qui consiste \u00e0 aider les parents qui vivent des situations dans lesquelles ils ne peuvent pas faire garder leurs enfants. Plut\u00f4t que de prendre des mesures disciplinaires contre un employ\u00e9 qui s'absente d'un quart de travail pour cette raison, le CN permet \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de s'absenter sans \u00eatre pay\u00e9 pendant quelques quarts de travail afin de lui permettre de prendre les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires. Le CN traitait Mme Hoyt de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re dont il traitait tous les autres employ\u00e9s ayant des pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la garde d'enfants. Le fait que le CN traitait Mme Hoyt de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re dont il traitait d'autres employ\u00e9s ayant des pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la garde d'enfants ne signifie pas que Mme Hoyt n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi.\n[127] Le CN n'a pas fourni un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt pendant trois mois et demi. Elle est rest\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison en cong\u00e9 sans solde. Au moment o\u00f9 le CN a finalement rendu disponible un poste de conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe, Mme Hoyt n'avait plus la possibilit\u00e9 de faire garder son enfant au service de garde avec lequel elle avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment pris des dispositions. Elle n'a pas pu obtenir un autre service de garde pour trois semaines. On lui a toutefois offert une fois de plus un cong\u00e9 sans solde. Dans ces circonstances, je conclus que, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, il \u00e9tait discriminatoire pour le CN de ne pas fournir un accommodement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la modeste demande qui r\u00e9sultait de sa conduite fautive ant\u00e9rieure.\n[128] Il est aussi frappant de voir la diff\u00e9rence avec le traitement offert \u00e0 M. Sawatzky, l'employ\u00e9 qui conduisait le v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe avant elle. Il conduisait le v\u00e9hicule du lundi au vendredi. De plus, M. Sawatzky quittait son travail plus t\u00f4t pour aller faire de la physioth\u00e9rapie chaque jour et il \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 pendant les p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 il faisait de la physioth\u00e9rapie. On r\u00e9pondait largement \u00e0 ses besoins. Pourquoi les besoins d'accommodement de Mme Hoyt n'ont-ils pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits?\n[129] Je conclus que la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Mme Hoyt a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 selon la preuve qu'elle \u00e9tait un parent et qu'elle avait des t\u00e2ches et obligations de parent \u00e0 accomplir. Mme Hoyt a tent\u00e9 d'obtenir, dans un tr\u00e8s court d\u00e9lai, un service de garde d'enfants de qualit\u00e9 qui ne causerait pas un stress indu \u00e0 sa petite fille. Elle a r\u00e9ussi en grande partie et elle n'avait besoin qu'on lui fournisse un accommodement que pour trois jours. La directive du CN selon laquelle elle pouvait rester \u00e0 la maison ces trois samedis, sans \u00eatre pay\u00e9e, faisait en sorte qu'elle n'avait pas de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res chez son employeur.\nF. La justification du CN [130] Le CN justifiait le rejet de la demande de Mme Hoyt de travailler du lundi au vendredi pendant trois semaines en juin en disant que le surintendant Valliere avait fait certaines recherches et avait d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le quart de travail du mardi au samedi \u00e9tait le plus viable au CN \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les taxis \u00e9taient particuli\u00e8rement occup\u00e9s le vendredi et le samedi et \u00e9taient ainsi plus souvent en retard pour passer prendre les membres de l'\u00e9quipe. Des \u00e9quipes en retard co\u00fbtaient de l'argent.\nG. La conduite du CN \u00e9tait-elle justifi\u00e9e? La conduite \u00e9tait-elle une EPJ? [131] Passant \u00e0 l'analyse de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) selon ce qui est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, je conclus que les deux premiers volets du crit\u00e8re ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis par le CN. Premi\u00e8rement, la d\u00e9cision de cr\u00e9er un quart de travail du mardi au samedi avait un lien rationnel avec un objectif de productivit\u00e9 li\u00e9 au travail du CN. M. Valliere a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le quart de travail du mardi au samedi \u00e9tait le quart de travail pendant lequel le v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe \u00e9tait le plus utile au CN. Deuxi\u00e8mement, je conclus que le CN a pris la d\u00e9cision en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser cet objectif et qu'il n'y avait pas d'animosit\u00e9 discriminatoire.\n[132] Cependant, je conclus que l'employeur ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau \u00e9tabli suivant le troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re. Le CN n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'il aurait subi une contrainte excessive s'il avait adapt\u00e9 l'horaire de Mme Hoyt. Mme Hoyt aurait, pendant trois semaines, travaill\u00e9 un dimanche ou un lundi, des jours pendant lesquels un v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe n'\u00e9tait pas aussi utile au CN. Subsidiairement, le CN aurait d\u00fb payer un autre employ\u00e9 pour conduire le v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe les samedis ou donner aux employ\u00e9s ayant besoin de se d\u00e9placer la directive d'appeler un taxi, comme le CN faisait quand il n'y avait pas de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe en service. Le CN n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant aux co\u00fbts en cause et il n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il aurait subi une contrainte excessive. Je conclus que le CN ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nH. Conclusion de discrimination [133] Pour tous les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, je conclus que Mme Hoyt a fait l'objet de discrimination du fait de son sexe et de sa situation de famille, en contravention de l'article 7 de la LCDP, parce que l'intim\u00e9e a omis de lui fournir un accommodement. Je conclus que le CN n'a pas \u00e9tabli que son omission d'avoir fourni un accommodement qui tenait compte du sexe et de la situation de famille de Mme Hoyt d\u00e9coulait d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e suivant l'article 15 de la LCDP. La plainte de Mme Hoyt est par cons\u00e9quent fond\u00e9e.\nV. LES REDRESSEMENTS DEMAND\u00c9S A. Par la plaignante (i) Une ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant que le CN r\u00e9vise sa politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement [134] Mme Hoyt demande une ordonnance, suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, pr\u00e9voyant que le CN prenne, en consultation avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, des mesures de redressement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son omission de fournir un accommodement appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s.\n[135] J'ai entendu au cours de l'audience de la preuve quant aux ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents du CN en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement aux employ\u00e9s. La preuve fournie par le CN pr\u00e9sentait certaines histoires d'une r\u00e9ussite et la preuve fournie par le syndicat et celle fournie par Mme Hoyt \u00e9tablissaient l'existence d'histoires moins r\u00e9ussies. On m'a remis des d\u00e9cisions portant sur des arbitrages de griefs, mais aucun employ\u00e9, autre que Mme Hoyt, n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage sur une exp\u00e9rience v\u00e9cue lorsqu'il a eu besoin de mesures d'accommodement. L'avocate de la plaignante demandait avec insistance que je tire une conclusion selon laquelle il existait au CN de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique et que j'accorde le redressement demand\u00e9 sur le fondement de cette conclusion. J'estime, cependant, que la preuve dont dispose le Tribunal n'\u00e9tait pas ad\u00e9quate pour que je tire quelque conclusion qu'il existe des probl\u00e8mes syst\u00e9miques \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des processus du CN en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement ou pour que j'ordonne un redressement sur le fondement d'une telle conclusion.\n[136] Je conclus, cependant, que l'ordonnance demand\u00e9e par la plaignante devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. D'abord, bien que le CN ait une politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement, cette politique n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie. La politique envisage des rapports ax\u00e9s sur l'attention et la consultation entre le CN et ses employ\u00e9s qui ont besoin de mesures d'accommodement. Le CN doit en premier lieu rencontrer l'employ\u00e9, afin de d\u00e9couvrir les besoins, examiner les possibilit\u00e9s, documenter les mesures prises et communiquer \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 les mesures prises et les raisons des d\u00e9cisions rendues. La preuve \u00e9tablit clairement que le CN n'a pas suivi les directives \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard lorsqu'il a examin\u00e9 les possibilit\u00e9s d'accommodement \u00e0 offrir \u00e0 Mme Hoyt.\n[137] La preuve d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement que le CN, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de ses employ\u00e9s charg\u00e9s de faciliter l'accommodement, a adopt\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt une m\u00e9thode qui, de fa\u00e7on alarmante, est loin de son obligation de fournir un accommodement. Je suis convaincue que la politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement du CN ne formule pas suffisamment clairement le contenu de l'obligation de l'employeur de fournir un accommodement et les directives quant au processus de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin. Je suis \u00e9galement convaincue que le CN n'a pas pris les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour s'assurer que ses employ\u00e9s qui traitaient la demande d'accommodement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Hoyt comprennent le contenu de l'obligation de l'employeur et suivent les directives quant au processus \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin. Je conclus pour ces raisons que cette demande de redressement est justifi\u00e9e.\n[138] J'ordonne, suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, que le CN mette fin aux actes discriminatoires et que le CN prenne, en consultation avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables, et en particulier que le CN prenne les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour s'assurer que l'intim\u00e9e et ses employ\u00e9s charg\u00e9s de faciliter l'accommodement comprennent le contenu de l'obligation de l'employeur de fournir un accommodement aux employ\u00e9es enceintes et le processus \u00e0 utiliser pour en faciliter l'application.\n(ii) Une indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire et d'avantages [139] Suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, j'ordonne au CN d'indemniser Mme Hoyt pour toutes pertes de salaires et d'avantages subies du 18 f\u00e9vrier 2002 jusqu'\u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle elle a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire le v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe en juillet 2002. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que Mme Hoyt a re\u00e7u du CN certaines sommes d'argent \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 partielle pour pertes de salaire au cours de cette p\u00e9riode et j'ordonne que l'indemnit\u00e9 soit ajust\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence.\n(iii) Une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral [140] Mme Hoyt a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'effet \u00e9motionnel que la conduite du CN a cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour elle. Mme Hoyt a d\u00e9crit qu'au d\u00e9part elle s'\u00e9tait sentie perplexe. Elle avait tenu pour acquis que le CN s'acquitterait de son obligation l\u00e9gale de lui fournir un accommodement. Elle a ensuite senti qu'elle \u00e9tait trahie par son employeur, elle avait le sentiment que son employeur ne l'appr\u00e9ciait pas et elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9prim\u00e9e. Nos tribunaux ont reconnu le r\u00f4le central qu'occupe l'emploi d'un individu quant \u00e0 son sens d'identit\u00e9, \u00e0 son estime de soi et \u00e0 son bien-\u00eatre moral (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alb.), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 313, \u00e0 la page 368). Il est triste, mais non surprenant d'entendre que la conduite de l'employeur de Mme Hoyt lui a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice moral. L'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et la d\u00e9tresse d'\u00eatre \u00e0 la maison, sans obtenir aucun accommodement et sans recevoir quelque communication de la part du CN, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9crit une lettre demandant des renseignements, ont augment\u00e9 \u00e0 mesure que le temps a pass\u00e9. Mme Hoyt s'inqui\u00e9tait du fait que le temps pendant lequel elle ne travaillait pas ferait en sorte qu'elle ne serait pas admissible \u00e0 des prestations de maternit\u00e9 au titre de l'assurance-emploi. La conduite du CN a s\u00e9rieusement \u00e9branl\u00e9 Mme Hoyt \u00e0 un moment qui aurait autrement pu \u00eatre une p\u00e9riode heureuse pour elle et les membres de sa famille alors qu'ils planifiaient la venue d'un enfant et qu'ils en r\u00eavaient.\n[141] Mme Hoyt \u00e9tait en grande d\u00e9tresse \u00e0 son retour au CN apr\u00e8s avoir accept\u00e9 le poste de conducteur de v\u00e9hicule de transport de l'\u00e9quipe. Lorsqu'elle a appris que le CN refusait une fois de plus de lui fournir un accommodement raisonnable et faisait valoir que, apr\u00e8s trois mois et demi de cong\u00e9 sans solde, l'accommodement qu'elle recevrait quant aux questions de garde d'enfants serait trois jours suppl\u00e9mentaires de cong\u00e9s sans solde, Mme Hoyt est devenue tr\u00e8s agit\u00e9e et boulevers\u00e9e. Ses sympt\u00f4mes \u00e9taient aigus au point qu'elle a d\u00fb se rendre \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital peu apr\u00e8s son altercation avec M. Sherbo. Son m\u00e9decin a ordonn\u00e9 qu'elle s'absente du travail pendant un mois \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9tresse qu'elle avait, et qu'elle continuerait probablement d'avoir \u00e0 son lieu de travail en raison de la plus r\u00e9cente position discriminatoire du CN, compromettrait sa propre sant\u00e9 et celle de son enfant \u00e0 na\u00eetre.\n[142] Je conclus que Mme Hoyt a subi un important pr\u00e9judice moral. J'ordonne au CN, suivant le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP, de payer \u00e0 Mme Hoyt une indemnit\u00e9 de 15 000 $ pour ce pr\u00e9judice moral.\n(iv) Une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [143] La plaignante demande une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale. En vertu de la LCDP, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale maximale de 20 000 $ s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion qu'un intim\u00e9 a commis un acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 (paragraphe 53(3)). J'ai conclu que le CN savait qu'il se livrait \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire ou qu'il croyait de fa\u00e7on inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e qu'il ne le faisait pas. Il est par cons\u00e9quent appropri\u00e9 d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale et j'accorde une indemnit\u00e9 de 10 000 $.\n(v) Les frais juridiques [144] La plaignante demande une ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant que l'intim\u00e9e paie les frais juridiques qu'elle a engag\u00e9s au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instance. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) donne au Tribunal, s'il conclut qu'une plainte est fond\u00e9e, le pouvoir de rendre entre autres une ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant que l'intim\u00e9 indemnise la victime pour des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte.\n[145] La question de savoir si l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) donne au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjuger une indemnit\u00e9 pour des frais juridiques a fait l'objet d'une certaine controverse devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. On a conclu dans deux d\u00e9cisions que le Tribunal a effectivement une telle comp\u00e9tence : (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Thwaites (1994), 21 C.H.R.R. D\/224, Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Brooks, [2006] CF 500(1re inst.). On a conclu dans une autre d\u00e9cision que le Tribunal n'a pas une telle comp\u00e9tence (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Green, [2004] 4 C.F. 629 (1re inst.).\n[146] Les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui confirment la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal mentionnent qu'il n'y a aucune raison de limiter le sens ordinaire de l'expression des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 exclure les frais juridiques engag\u00e9s par une victime. Le fait que les avocats et les juges puissent donner un sens particulier au mot frais ne fournit aucun fondement permettant de pr\u00e9tendre que le sens ordinaire de l'expression d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es exclut les frais juridiques (voir Thwaites, par le juge Gibson).\n[147] Le Tribunal a exerc\u00e9 la comp\u00e9tence d'adjuger des frais. La pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish (maintenant juge \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) a utilis\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode pr\u00e9cise quant \u00e0 la question de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal (Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel), [2001] DCDP no 29). Souscrivant \u00e0 la conclusion de la d\u00e9cision Thwaites tir\u00e9e en utilisant une interpr\u00e9tation conventionnelle de la loi, la pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish a mentionn\u00e9 que la loi en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, compte tenu de son statut fondamental et quasi constitutionnel, doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale conforme \u00e0 son but non seulement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par une telle loi, mais aussi \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des pouvoirs accord\u00e9s au Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de redressement (Nkwazi, au paragraphe 13; voir \u00e9galement Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, \u00e0 la page 1136; Robichaud c. La Reine, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84).\n[148] Je partage l'opinion voulant qu'une conclusion selon laquelle le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence d'adjuger des d\u00e9pens soit d\u00e9fendable et appropri\u00e9e selon les principes habituels d'interpr\u00e9tation des lois. En outre, une telle conclusion est requise selon l'interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale et conforme au but que la LCDP incite \u00e0 avoir.\n[149] Je partage \u00e9galement l'opinion de la pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish selon laquelle, [l]orsqu'il juge que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal doit, sous r\u00e9serve des principes de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 des dommages et de l'att\u00e9nuation des pertes, tenter dans la mesure du possible, de remettre la victime dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, n'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire (Nkwazi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 17). Je partage de plus l'opinion selon laquelle la LCDP, en conf\u00e9rant une comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de redressement, pr\u00e9cise clairement que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de prendre des mesures de redressement qu'il juge pertinentes compte tenu des circonstances qui entourent l'affaire (Nkwazi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 18).\n[150] Premi\u00e8rement, il ne peut y avoir aucun doute que le CN peut, quant aux frais juridiques, remettre Mme Hoyt dans la position o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait auparavant. Les t\u00e9moins du CN ont confirm\u00e9 que la compagnie est en tr\u00e8s bonne situation financi\u00e8re. Un article de journal a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ce au cours de l'instance. L'article du Toronto Star est dat\u00e9 du 21 avril 2006 et il \u00e9tablit que le CN a affich\u00e9 pour le premier trimestre de 2006 un profit de 362 millions de dollars.\n[151] Deuxi\u00e8mement, j'estime qu'aucune question pouvant \u00e0 bon droit limiter une adjudication de frais n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 ou de l'att\u00e9nuation. J'ai conclu que le CN savait ou devait savoir qu'il se livrait \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire. Les frais juridiques de Mme Hoyt ont r\u00e9sult\u00e9 d'un acte discriminatoire. Il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre tout \u00e0 fait pr\u00e9visible pour cet employeur averti qu'un employ\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la sorte de conduite r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e en preuve dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire retiendrait les services d'un avocat et engagerait des frais juridiques.\n[152] Troisi\u00e8mement, je n'ai connaissance d'aucun fait qui puisse sugg\u00e9rer que la question de l'att\u00e9nuation puisse s'appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce d'une fa\u00e7on \u00e0 limiter \u00e0 bon droit une adjudication de frais. Je n'ai pas conclu que la plaignante ou son avocate ont adopt\u00e9 des positions d\u00e9raisonnables ou ont prolong\u00e9 ind\u00fbment la pr\u00e9sente instance. Je n'ai connaissance d'aucune offre de r\u00e8glement qui a pu \u00eatre faite par le CN avant l'audience. Si une offre de r\u00e8glement plus avantageuse que les redressements ordonn\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, une telle offre pourrait s'appliquer \u00e0 la question de l'att\u00e9nuation. Dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il y a eu une offre de r\u00e8glement de la nature de celle d\u00e9crite, j'invite les avocats \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations additionnelles.\n[153] Je conclus dans les circonstances que, sous r\u00e9serve d'une preuve d\u00e9montrant qu'il y a eu une offre de r\u00e8glement comme j'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les frais juridiques de la plaignante devraient \u00eatre rembours\u00e9s et j'ordonne au CN de rembourser \u00e0 la plaignante ses frais juridiques raisonnables. J'encourage les parties \u00e0 s'efforcer de s'entendre quant \u00e0 un montant appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, mais je demeure saisie de l'affaire dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il ne leur serait pas possible d'arriver \u00e0 une entente.\n(vi) Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [154] De l'int\u00e9r\u00eat est payable \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toutes les adjudications faites dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision suivant le paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat sera de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat simple calcul\u00e9 sur une base annuelle \u00e0 un taux qui \u00e9quivaut au taux bancaire (s\u00e9ries mensuelles) \u00e9tabli par la Banque du Canada, suivant le paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral et de l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat courra \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte.\n(vii) La r\u00e9tention de comp\u00e9tence par le Tribunal [155] Le Tribunal demeure saisi de l'affaire pour recevoir de la preuve, entendre des observations additionnelles et rendre d'autres ordonnances, dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 les parties n'arriveraient pas \u00e0 conclure une entente \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toute question r\u00e9sultant de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'interpr\u00e9tation ou de la mise en application des redressements ordonn\u00e9s. Dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 les parties ont besoin de directives quant \u00e0 quelque question se rapportant au redressement, autre que l'ordonnance suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a), ils peuvent en demander au plus tard 60 jours apr\u00e8s la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nB. Le redressement demand\u00e9 par la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e (i) Les frais juridiques [156] Le syndicat, une partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, demande le remboursement de ses frais juridiques. J'estime que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour faire une adjudication \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) conf\u00e8re la comp\u00e9tence d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 d'indemniser la victime \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte. J'estime que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cet alin\u00e9a de la Loi, suivant une interpr\u00e9tation conventionnelle ou suivant une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale conforme \u00e0 son but, cette comp\u00e9tence d'ordonner des redressements n'existe que lorsque le Tribunal a conclu qu'il y a eu un acte discriminatoire et alors seulement pour la victime de l'acte discriminatoire. Le syndicat a ressenti du m\u00e9contentement du fait des all\u00e9gations faites par le CN \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Cependant, le syndicat n'all\u00e8gue pas qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un acte discriminatoire.\n(ii) Une d\u00e9claration [157] Le syndicat tente d'obtenir de la part du Tribunal une d\u00e9claration selon laquelle il n'a pas commis une faute quant aux mesures prises pour fournir un accommodement \u00e0 Mme Hoyt. J'estime que je n'ai pas comp\u00e9tence pour faire une telle d\u00e9claration pour une partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. J'ai trait\u00e9 de la conduite du CN et de celle du syndicat dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Cela devra suffire.\nJulie c.

INTRODUCTION [1] Karen Schulyer est membre de la Nation des Oneidas de la Thames du sud de l'Ontario. Elle a quitt\u00e9 cette communaut\u00e9 lorsqu'elle \u00e9tait jeune, puis elle y est retourn\u00e9e afin d'occuper un poste administratif sup\u00e9rieur au sein de l'administration de la bande. Plus tard, un cancer fut diagnostiqu\u00e9 chez elle et elle a d\u00fb \u00eatre hospitalis\u00e9e.\n[2] Apr\u00e8s que Mme Schuyler eut quitt\u00e9 l'h\u00f4pital, elle a inform\u00e9 la bande qu'elle d\u00e9sirait retourner travailler \u00e0 temps partiel. Sa demande n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e et, le 20 janvier 2004, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne dans laquelle elle a pr\u00e9tendu que la bande n'avait pris aucune mesure d'accommodement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[3] Lorsque Mme Schuyler est retourn\u00e9e au travail, les relations entre elle et le conseil de bande ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer. Mme Schuyler avait l'impression que le conseil \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re contre elle en raison de son d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et que, en cons\u00e9quence, il exer\u00e7ait des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle. Apr\u00e8s une s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements plut\u00f4t difficiles, Mme Schuyler a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement a men\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une deuxi\u00e8me plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, laquelle n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e que le 20 janvier 2004.\n[4] Les deux plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP). Une audience fut tenue en mai, septembre et d\u00e9cembre 2006 \u00e0 London (Ontario). La d\u00e9cision qui suit analyse la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les deux parties et statue sur les plaintes.\nII. LES FAITS [5] Il serait d'abord utile d'en apprendre sur le fonctionnement de la bande avant d'analyser les faits. Pendant la dur\u00e9e des fonctions de Mme Schuyler, le poste d'administrateur ex\u00e9cutif \u00e9tait le poste le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 au sein de l'administration de la bande. Ce poste a maintenant \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par le poste de directeur des op\u00e9rations, et ce, peut-\u00eatre en raison des questions en litige qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[6] Randy Phillips a travaill\u00e9 comme analyste des politiques pour la Nation des Oneidas et il a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu chef de la bande. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, au sein de la bande, le pouvoir d\u00e9cisionnel rel\u00e8ve d'ordinaire du conseil. Le conseil se r\u00e9unit environ une fois par semaine, en soir\u00e9e. Id\u00e9alement, les d\u00e9cisions sont prises par consensus. Lorsque cela ne fonctionne pas, un vote est tenu et la majorit\u00e9 statue sur la proposition. L'administrateur ex\u00e9cutif peut soulever des questions au conseil mais il ne participe pas d'une mani\u00e8re directe, sauf pour informer le conseil.\n[7] M. Phillips a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Schulyer n'entretenait pas de bonnes relations avec le conseil. Il a eu l'amabilit\u00e9 d'affirmer que cela \u00e9tait en partie d\u00fb aux difficult\u00e9s intrins\u00e8ques au poste. Le conseil avait tendance \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer l'administrateur ex\u00e9cutif lorsque ses politiques n'\u00e9taient pas mises en uvre.\nA. L'examen du rendement : Juillet 2000 [8] Mme Schuyler a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par le conseil de bande comme administratrice ex\u00e9cutive en juin 1998. Elle a propos\u00e9 qu'on lui fasse signer un contrat de gestion, ce qui ne fut pas accept\u00e9 par le conseil. Le conseil lui a fait signer un de ses contrats-types en juillet. Ce contrat pr\u00e9voyait une p\u00e9riode probatoire de six mois.\n[9] Le chef Harry Doxtator a occup\u00e9 la fonction de chef des Oneidas pendant environ douze ans et a occup\u00e9 la fonction de grand chef de l'Association des Iroquois et des indiens unis. Il a travaill\u00e9 avec Mme Schuyler pendant quatre ou cinq ans. Il \u00e9tait le chef du comit\u00e9 de probation.\n[10] Des probl\u00e8mes sont apparus d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but. Le chef Doxtator a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'un questionnaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remis aux membres du personnel. On avait fix\u00e9 une entrevue avec Mme Schuyler et celle-ci a annul\u00e9 l'entrevue, apparemment parce qu'elle n'aimait pas l'id\u00e9e qu'on se serve d'un questionnaire. Elle d\u00e9sirait voir le questionnaire.\n[11] Il semble clair que le comit\u00e9 estimait que Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait une pi\u00e8tre gestionnaire. Celle-ci appliquait des [traduction] pratiques de gestion inhabituelles et elle omettait parfois de suivre les proc\u00e9dures ad\u00e9quates. Le processus s'est rapidement transform\u00e9 en confrontation. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage du chef Doxtator selon lequel Mme Schuyler a affirm\u00e9 qu'il en co\u00fbterait beaucoup d'argent \u00e0 la bande si elle d\u00e9sirait se d\u00e9barrasser d'elle.\n[12] Mme Schuyler, quant \u00e0 elle, s'est plainte qu'on a mis trois ans \u00e0 effectuer l'examen probatoire. On s'est beaucoup querell\u00e9. \u00c0 un certain moment, le comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Mme Schuyler dans laquelle il lui a demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un certain nombre de questions. Celle-ci lui a envoy\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9taill\u00e9e le 13 mai 1999.\n[13] Ce n'est toutefois que le 20 juin 2000 que le comit\u00e9 a effectu\u00e9 l'examen. Mme Schuyler a \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant moyenne ou inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la moyenne quant \u00e0 tous les facteurs de rendement figurant dans l'\u00e9valuation personnelle. Mme Schuyler a cependant obtenu un pointage exceptionnel aux chapitres de l'initiative, de l'assertivit\u00e9 et de la confiance. La v\u00e9rit\u00e9, toutefois, est que le comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation a exprim\u00e9 des inqui\u00e9tudes quant au rendement de Mme Schuyler.\n[14] Mme Schuyler a refus\u00e9 de signer l'\u00e9valuation. Dans une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite dat\u00e9e du 26 juin 2000, elle a adopt\u00e9 le point de vue que le fait que le conseil n'ait pas s\u00e9par\u00e9 son r\u00f4le de celui de l'administration avait pour cons\u00e9quence de miner l'autorit\u00e9 et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l'administrateur ex\u00e9cutif. Il semble caract\u00e9ristique qu'elle n'ait pas reconnu les difficult\u00e9s qu'elle a \u00e9prouv\u00e9es dans le cadre de ses relations de travail avec les autres personnes.\n[15] Malgr\u00e9 les d\u00e9saccords, un certain nombre de recommandations sont ressorties du rapport d'\u00e9valuation. L'une d'elles \u00e9tait qu'un comit\u00e9 ad hoc de grief soit cr\u00e9\u00e9 afin d'examiner les probl\u00e8mes relatifs au poste d'administrateur ex\u00e9cutif. Une autre \u00e9tait que Mme Schuyler obtienne l'\u00e9quivalent d'une douzi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e.\n[16] Le rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis au conseil le 25 juillet 2000. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 par le conseil aux petites heures du matin, apr\u00e8s la tenue de l'une des r\u00e9unions r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Mme Schuyler a estim\u00e9 que cela \u00e9tait injuste. Le chef Doxtator n'a pas souscris \u00e0 cette opinion. L'affaire \u00e9tait urgente et il n'y avait aucun autre moment o\u00f9 on pouvait la r\u00e9gler.\n[17] Les conseillers ont concentr\u00e9 leur attention sur les choses que les gestionnaires de programme avaient affirm\u00e9es. Le comit\u00e9 avait envoy\u00e9 des questionnaires au chef, au conseil et aux membres du personnel. Mme Schuyler affirme qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de r\u00e9pondre de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate parce qu'elle ne disposait pas du questionnaire. On lui a dit que les questionnaires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truits.\n[18] Le conseil a finalement accept\u00e9 le rapport et a demand\u00e9 un suivi de six mois. Ce suivi a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 mais n'a jamais eu lieu. Selon Mme Schuyler, le processus \u00e9tait unilat\u00e9ral et incomplet. Elle affirme qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de consentir \u00e0 des choses [traduction] sous la contrainte en raison de l'heure et de la pression \u00e9motive qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e sur elle.\n[19] Mme Schuyler a estim\u00e9 qu'on la traitait d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente parce qu'elle avait v\u00e9cu \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9serve pendant 35 ans. L'\u00e9valuation pr\u00e9liminaire faisait \u00e9tat qu'elle devait se r\u00e9ins\u00e9rer dans la communaut\u00e9. Elle a demand\u00e9 que l'on retire ce commentaire de l'\u00e9valuation finale. Elle ne sentait aucunement le besoin de se r\u00e9ins\u00e9rer dans la communaut\u00e9. Il convient de souligner que Mme Schuyler a modifi\u00e9 sa position en contre-interrogatoire.\n[20] Il semble clair que le probl\u00e8me trouvait principalement sa source dans les relations que Mme Schuyler entretenait avec les 25 gestionnaires de programme qui relevaient de son autorit\u00e9. Les relations entre Mme Schuyler et ces gestionnaires \u00e9taient tendues, pour le moins qu'on puisse dire. Le 28 novembre 2000, un courriel controvers\u00e9 dans lequel on se plaignait du style de gestion de Mme Schulyer a \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9 avec copie \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re. La port\u00e9e de ce courriel \u00e9tait tout simplement que l'insatisfaction r\u00e9gnait chez les membres du personnel.\n[21] Mme Schuyler affirme que c'est le conseil qui \u00e9tait la source du probl\u00e8me. Elle entretenait une pi\u00e8tre relation avec le conseil et celle-ci a continu\u00e9 de se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer pendant toute la p\u00e9riode des plaintes. L'autorit\u00e9 hi\u00e9rarchique n'\u00e9tait pas claire et les gestionnaires de programme s'adressaient continuellement au conseil \u00e0 l'insu de Mme Schuyler. \u00c0 un certain moment, Mme Schuyler a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les membres du personnel ne l'aimaient pas en raison de mesures disciplinaires qu'elle avait prises \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard.\n[22] Randy Phillips a pris la part des gestionnaires de programme et il se souvient d'une intervention de la part de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ou de la part de la Commission des relations de travail. On a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler le conflit par la m\u00e9diation le 27 janvier 2001. Il semble qu'entre 15 et 20 personnes ont particip\u00e9 au processus de m\u00e9diation. De ce nombre figuraient Mme Schuyler, un certain nombre de gestionnaires de programme, le chef et deux membres du conseil.\n[23] Le processus de m\u00e9diation fut \u00e9prouvant. Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait sur la d\u00e9fensive et a discut\u00e9 du d\u00e9p\u00f4t possible d'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droit de la personne avec l'un des m\u00e9diateurs. Une entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin de la m\u00e9diation. Seulement trois des gestionnaires de programme l'ont sign\u00e9e, les autres ont refus\u00e9. Ceux-ci \u00e9taient apparemment tr\u00e8s m\u00e9contents du processus. L'examen du rendement au travail de Mme Schuyler s'est poursuivi.\n[24] Le comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Schulyer le 22 mars 2001 afin de faire le suivi. Celle-ci a protest\u00e9. Le comit\u00e9 lui a demand\u00e9 de faire part par \u00e9crit de ses pr\u00e9occupations, ce qu'elle a fait au moyen d'un m\u00e9moire \u00e9crit dat\u00e9 du 25 avril 2001. Elle n'a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse.\nB. Le cancer : juillet 2001 [25] Mme Schuyler est tomb\u00e9e malade en juillet 2001. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9e pendant environ huit jours en raison d'un blocage de l'intestin. Elle \u00e9tait incapable de garder ses aliments et elle affaiblissait de plus en plus. On l'a nourrie par voie intraveineuse. En fin de compte, le probl\u00e8me de blocage s'est r\u00e9sorb\u00e9 de lui-m\u00eame. Apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut quitt\u00e9 l'h\u00f4pital, Mme Schuyler a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie, puis des vacances. Elle s'est absent\u00e9e du travail jusqu'au d\u00e9but de septembre.\n[26] Mme Schuyler a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle suivait actuellement un traitement pour un ulc\u00e8re gastroduod\u00e9nal et qu'elle perdait du poids. J'ai accueilli en preuve une lettre \u00e9manant du Dr McDonough mais j'ai exclu les notes de cas de ce dernier. Le m\u00e9decin a semble-t-il d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 en Irlande et il n'est plus disponible. Le Tribunal peut assouplir les r\u00e8gles de preuve en vue de mettre \u00e0 jour la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n[27] L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas contest\u00e9 les lignes sommaires de la situation d\u00e9crite dans la lettre du m\u00e9decin. La lettre fait \u00e9tat que Mme Schulyer souffrait de stress. Les d\u00e9tails du dossier m\u00e9dical de Mme Schuyler ne sont pas en cause en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il est manifeste que le mauvais climat de travail a eu une incidence sur elle au plan physique. Elle \u00e9tait fatigu\u00e9e et elle \u00e9tait incapable de se concentrer.\n[28] Mme Schuyler a subi un certain nombre d'examens m\u00e9dicaux entre septembre et novembre. En novembre, son m\u00e9decin lui a ordonn\u00e9 de prendre deux semaines de cong\u00e9. Cette ordonnance fut suivie d'une autre ordonnance dans laquelle le m\u00e9decin demandait une autre fois \u00e0 Mme Schuyler de demeurer en cong\u00e9. Celle-ci a subi une coloscopie le 21 d\u00e9cembre.\n[29] Les m\u00e9decins de Mme Schuyler ont d\u00e9couvert qu'elle \u00e9tait atteinte d'un cancer du colon. On lui a fait subir d'autres examens et on l'a op\u00e9r\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de f\u00e9vrier. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9e pendant huit jours et elle s'est fait enlever une partie du colon. Elle est demeur\u00e9e en convalescence \u00e0 la maison jusqu'en mai 2002, puis elle a subi un traitement de chimioth\u00e9rapie jusqu'en septembre.\nC. Le temps partiel : 6 mai 2002 [30] Dans ses conclusions finales, Mme Schuyler affirme qu'elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 retourner au travail.\n[traduction]\nApr\u00e8s avoir failli perdre la vie, je d\u00e9sirais retourner \u00e0 une vie normale. Je croyais que retourner travailler \u00e0 temps partiel serait un pas dans la bonne direction. Je savais que je ne pouvais pas accomplir tout le travail d'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive en ne travaillant qu'\u00e0 temps partiel mais j'estimais que je pouvais toujours apporter une contribution importante.\nEn avril, le Dr McDonough a permis \u00e0 Mme Schuyler de recommencer \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[31] Mme Schuyler est alors entr\u00e9e en communication avec Holly Elijah, l'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive int\u00e9rimaire, laquelle avait d\u00fb parler au chef Doxtator. Le chef a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Schuyler et lui a dit que le conseil \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par son retour au travail. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le conseil estimait qu'elle ne serait pas capable de supporter la pression. Je suis d'accord avec Mme Schuyler lorsqu'elle affirme que le conseil ne voulait pas qu'elle retourne au travail.\n[32] Le chef Doxtator a inform\u00e9 Mme Schuyler que le comit\u00e9 des ressources humaines devrait examiner la situation et qu'elle devrait rencontrer les membres du comit\u00e9. Selon Mme Schuyler, le conseil tentait tout simplement de l'emp\u00eacher de retourner au travail. La bande avait toutefois une politique. Un employ\u00e9 devait rencontrer les membres d'un comit\u00e9 des ressources humaines avant de retourner travailler apr\u00e8s une longue absence.\n[33] Chacune des deux parties faisait preuve d'une certaine hostilit\u00e9. Le 6 mai, Mme Schuyler aurait cens\u00e9ment dit au chef Doxtator que son cancer constituait une d\u00e9ficience et que la bande devrait prendre des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, et ce, en conformit\u00e9 avec la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne( la Loi). Le chef Doxtator a r\u00e9pondu que le conseil avait besoin d'un billet du m\u00e9decin.\n[34] Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s m\u00e9fiante. Deux jours plus tard, elle a \u00e9crit une lettre au chef Doxtator dans laquelle elle a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9\u00e7ue du fait qu'on ne lui ait pas accord\u00e9 un travail \u00e0 temps partiel. Elle est all\u00e9e porter la lettre au bureau du chef Doxtator le jour suivant. Elle a \u00e9galement rencontr\u00e9 les membres du comit\u00e9 des ressources humaines.\n[35] La r\u00e9union fut marqu\u00e9e par la confrontation. Le comit\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 sept points, allant des documents m\u00e9dicaux aux nombres d'heures que Mme Schuyler d\u00e9sirait travailler. Le comit\u00e9 a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 qu'il se sentait obliger de respecter les contrats qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 conclus pendant l'absence de Mme Schuyler. Le comit\u00e9 estimait apparemment qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dot\u00e9 de tout le personnel n\u00e9cessaire.\n[36] Le comit\u00e9 a clairement affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Schuyler que son poste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre personne. Le comit\u00e9 \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Schuyler dans ses fonctions. La r\u00e9union a dur\u00e9 une heure et demie. Le comit\u00e9 voulait que Mme Schuyler accepte un poste moins important. Le comit\u00e9 a convenu de cr\u00e9er un poste pour elle, mais il s'agirait d'un poste diff\u00e9rent comportant une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration diff\u00e9rente. Mme Schuyler a eu le sentiment que le comit\u00e9 livrait un message \u00e9manant du conseil. On ne voulait pas qu'elle retourne au travail.\n[37] Mme Schuyler a fondu en larmes \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Le comit\u00e9 lui a donn\u00e9 une terrible impression. Le comit\u00e9 a agi [traduction] comme si le cancer avan\u00e7ait ou quelque chose comme \u00e7a. Elle s'attendait \u00e0 plus de compassion. Le comit\u00e9 ne s'est pas souci\u00e9 de savoir si elle allait mieux ou non. Il ne s'est pas souci\u00e9 de savoir si elle \u00e9tait en vie ou si elle \u00e9tait morte. Mme Schuyler a affirm\u00e9 que le comit\u00e9 a estim\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait [traduction] mentalement incapable de s'acquitter de quelque charge de travail que ce soit.\n[38] Il s'agissait d'une situation complexe. Malgr\u00e9 cela, je suis convaincu que, en d\u00e9pit de leur indiff\u00e9rence apparente, le conseil et les membres du personnel se souciaient vraiment de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de Mme Schuyler. Mme Elijah a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que tout le monde dans la r\u00e9serve croyait que Mme Schuyler allait mourir. Cela ne voulait pas dire que le comit\u00e9 d\u00e9sirait l'accommoder.\n[39] Le comit\u00e9 des ressources humaines a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Schuyler qu'il allait faire une recommandation \u00e9crite au conseil. Charlie Cornelius a dit \u00e0 Mme Schuyler que le comit\u00e9 lui montrerait la lettre en premier. Mme Schuyler a re\u00e7u le rapport le 14 mai. Elle en a discut\u00e9 avec Lois Cornelius, la membre du comit\u00e9 qui lui a remis le rapport. Elle a dit \u00e0 Mme Cornelius qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas satisfaite de la d\u00e9claration figurant dans le rapport selon laquelle elle n'aurait aucun pouvoir.\n[40] Mme Schuyler a obtenu un billet de la part de son oncologue le 15 mai et elle a rencontr\u00e9 le chef. Le billet faisait \u00e9tat qu'elle \u00e9tait la mieux plac\u00e9e pour d\u00e9cider quelle charge de travail serait convenable et elle a inform\u00e9 le chef qu'elle d\u00e9sirait \u00eatre consult\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de ses t\u00e2ches. Il semble qu'il s'agisse l\u00e0 d'une partie normale de tout processus d'accommodement raisonnable.\n[41] Le rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis au conseil de bande le 12 juin et celui-ci a accept\u00e9 d'embaucher Mme Schuyler. Elle serait supervis\u00e9e par Holly Elijah, l'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive int\u00e9rimaire. Mme Elijah avait travaill\u00e9 comme assistante de Mme Schuyler lorsque celle-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois. Le conseil a adopt\u00e9 le point de vue, comme d'ailleurs le chef Doxtator, que le poste d'administrateur ex\u00e9cutif ne pouvait pas \u00eatre dot\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel. Ce poste ne pouvait pas non plus \u00eatre combl\u00e9 par deux personnes.\n[42] Le m\u00eame jour, Mme Elijah a r\u00e9pondu au nom de la bande et a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Schuyler un contrat de travail dans lequel \u00e9tait d\u00e9crit un poste \u00e0 temps partiel comportant des t\u00e2ches qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es. Le poste qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait un poste d'administratrice des projets sp\u00e9ciaux. Ce poste ne comportait pas les m\u00eames responsabilit\u00e9s ou le m\u00eame pouvoir \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des membres du personnel. Le nouveau contrat pour le poste faisait mention d'une p\u00e9riode probatoire de trois mois.\n[43] Le contrat stipulait que Mme Schuyler rel\u00e8verait de l'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive int\u00e9rimaire, du chef, du conseil ainsi que des directeurs de service. Les directeurs de service \u00e9taient des gestionnaires de programmes. Il s'agissait en quelque sorte d'une r\u00e9trogradation car ceux-ci avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 sous la supervision de Mme Schuyler. Il est \u00e9vident que celle-ci d\u00e9sirait conserver une certaine partie de ses pouvoirs.\n[44] Mme Schuyler a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 heureuse d'aider Mme Elijah \u00e0 temps partiel mais qu'elle d\u00e9sirait avoir son mot \u00e0 dire quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision relative au travail qu'on lui confierait. L'aspect le plus inqui\u00e9tant de l'offre \u00e9tait qu'elle pr\u00e9voyait une p\u00e9riode de probation de trois mois. Je crois que Mme Schuyler a le droit d'affirmer que cela \u00e9tait inacceptable. Par ailleurs, elle craignait que cette disposition ne permette au conseil de la cong\u00e9dier.\n[45] Mme Schuyler est all\u00e9e consulter Adrian Cameron, un avocat. Apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 de l'offre d'emploi \u00e0 temps partiel avec lui, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de la rejeter. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 retourner travailler dans les conditions que le conseil lui offrait. Elle croyait qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'attendre jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle puisse retourner travailler \u00e0 temps plein. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie d'assurances qu'elle ne retournerait pas travailler avant que ses traitements de chimioth\u00e9rapie ne soient termin\u00e9s.\n[46] Mme Elijah a estim\u00e9 que la bande suivait de bonne foi la politique en mati\u00e8re de personnel. Le chef Doxtator semblait l'appuyer. Le conseil a adopt\u00e9 le point de vue que Mme Schuyler avait tout simplement refus\u00e9 de participer au processus. Il y a peut-\u00eatre une attitude d\u00e9fensive dans cela : je crois que l'affaire est beaucoup plus nuanc\u00e9e et que la bande n'\u00e9tait pas particuli\u00e8rement int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 accommoder Mme Schuyler.\n[47] Le 19 juin 2002, l'avocat de Mme Schuyler a inform\u00e9 le conseil que celle-ci \u00e9tait incapable de retourner travailler et qu'elle recevrait des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein. Dans sa lettre, il a fait \u00e9tat de [traduction] nombreuses contraventions \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Schuyler demanderait que l'on prenne des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard lorsqu'elle retournerait travailler.\n[48] Au d\u00e9but de juillet, alors qu'un nouveau conseil de bande venait d'\u00eatre \u00e9lu, Mme Schuyler a remis \u00e0 Mme Elijah un chapitre tir\u00e9 du livre \u00e9crit par Elise NeeDell Babcock et intitul\u00e9 When Life Becomes Precious: A Guide for Loved Ones and Friends of Cancer Patients. Ce livre renferme des lignes directrices \u00e0 l'intention des employeurs lorsque ceux-ci sont confront\u00e9s \u00e0 des situations o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 est atteint du cancer. Cet extrait de livre aurait semble-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9 au nouveau conseil car Rolanda Elijah et Luke Nicholas, deux nouveaux conseillers, se sont rendus chez Mme Schuyler afin d'en discuter avec elle.\n[49] C'est le mois suivant que Mme Schuyler a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Mme Schuyler a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de Travail Canada le 26 ao\u00fbt 2002 en affirmant qu'elle avait fait l'objet d'un cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9. Je crois comprendre que la derni\u00e8re plainte a ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e.\nD. Le retour au travail : 15 octobre 2002 [50] Mme Schuyler s'est vu accorder une allocation d'invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein jusqu'au 15 octobre 2002. Elle a re\u00e7u des prestations d'assurance-emploi entre la fin de janvier et mai 2002. Elle a re\u00e7u des prestations de bien-\u00eatre social pendant le mois de juin de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Elle a \u00e9ventuellement compl\u00e9t\u00e9 ses traitements de chimioth\u00e9rapie et elle a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des s\u00e9ances de counseling traditionnel.\n[51] Mme Schuyler a beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi. Elle affirme qu'elle a pardonn\u00e9 \u00e0 tout le monde quant aux probl\u00e8mes du pass\u00e9 et qu'elle n'avait plus d'amertume. Elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 [traduction] d'oublier le pass\u00e9. Elle pr\u00e9tend que c'est dans de bonnes dispositions qu'elle est retourn\u00e9e travailler \u00e0 temps plein en octobre 2002.\n[52] Cette situation fut transitoire. Mme Schuyler a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s avec le nouveau conseil et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e 11 mois plus tard. Selon elle, c'est avec le chef qu'elle a eu des probl\u00e8mes. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait comme s'il ne voulait pas \u00eatre proche d'elle physiquement. Il y avait un manque de communication. Elle s'est plainte de n\u00e9potisme et elle a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Je n'avais pas de lien de parent\u00e9 avec lui.\n[53] Le 15 octobre, Mme Schuyler a rencontr\u00e9 le chef Doxtator. Celui-ci voulait qu'elle lui remette un billet du m\u00e9decin sign\u00e9 par son oncologue. Selon elle, elle rencontrait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un obstacle. Mme Schuyler s'est n\u00e9anmoins rendue en automobile \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, elle y a obtenu un billet du m\u00e9decin, puis elle est retourn\u00e9e au bureau de la bande. Elle n'a pas trouv\u00e9 le chef Doxtator et elle a eut l'impression que celui-ci l'ignorait.\n[54] Mme Schuyler a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une motion et elle a demand\u00e9 au secr\u00e9taire du conseil de l'inscrire \u00e0 l'ordre du jour de la prochaine r\u00e9union. Il \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 dans cette motion que le conseil acceptait [traduction] les documents m\u00e9dicaux qu'elle avait fournis et dans lesquels il \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait [traduction] m\u00e9dicalement apte \u00e0 occuper son poste d'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive. La motion faisait \u00e9tat que tous les employ\u00e9s devaient coop\u00e9rer \u00e0 son retour au travail. Elle affirme que le conseil a retir\u00e9 un paragraphe dans lequel elle demandait qu'on lui souhaite un bon retour au travail.\n[55] La r\u00e9union s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e dans un climat d'inconfort. Mme Schuyler a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il r\u00e9gnait une atmosph\u00e8re \u00e9trange dans la pi\u00e8ce. Les gens remuaient des feuilles de papier et d\u00e9tournaient le regard. Mme Schuyler a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] On aurait dit que tout le monde regardait le plancher. La motion a n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e. Mme Schuyler a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e qu'Holly Elijah conserverait son poste d'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive pour le reste de l'ann\u00e9e. Il y avait donc deux administratrices ex\u00e9cutives.\n[56] Cette situation n'a jamais clairement \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et elle semble all\u00e9e \u00e0 l'encontre de la position que la bande avait adopt\u00e9e en rapport avec le travail \u00e0 temps partiel. Mme Schuyler estime qu'on a permis \u00e0 Mme Elijah de conserver son poste parce qu'on craignait qu'elle ne soit pas capable de s'acquitter de ses t\u00e2ches. Je crois que les perceptions de Mme Schuyler n'\u00e9taient pas tout \u00e0 fait erron\u00e9es. Elle a n\u00e9anmoins accept\u00e9 cette situation. Elle ne voulait cr\u00e9er aucune animosit\u00e9.\n[57] Le chef Doxtator a adopt\u00e9 un point de vue diff\u00e9rent de celui de Mme Schuyler. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la relation qui existait entre le conseil et Mme Schuyler lorsque celle-ci est retourn\u00e9e au travail \u00e9tait une relation de [traduction] cordiale bienvenue. Cette relation s'est estomp\u00e9e avec le temps, mais seulement parce que le conseil avait pris de plus en plus conscience que Mme Schuyler ne poss\u00e9dait pas les aptitudes personnelles pour s'occuper des aspects interpersonnels li\u00e9s \u00e0 son emploi.\n[58] Mme Schuyler a pass\u00e9 la plus grande partie de novembre \u00e0 faire les \u00e9valuations de rendement des gestionnaires de programme. Il s'agissait d'auto-\u00e9valuations. Elle n'a pas eu beaucoup de contacts avec le chef. Mme Elijah s'est principalement occup\u00e9e de rattraper le retard accumul\u00e9 avec les proc\u00e8s-verbaux du conseil. Une retraite pour le personnel a eu lieu au d\u00e9but de novembre. On y a discut\u00e9 de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de s\u00e9parer les fonctions politiques et les fonctions administratives de la bande.\n[59] Toutefois, les vieilles animosit\u00e9s \u00e9taient toujours pr\u00e9sentes. \u00c0 un certain moment, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Schuyler de retirer sa plainte. \u00c0 un autre moment, probablement au d\u00e9but de 2003, Mme Schuyler affirme que quelqu'un a coll\u00e9 sur la porte de son bureau un papillon adh\u00e9sif sur lequel il \u00e9tait inscrit [traduction] Entrer \u00e0 vos propres risques. Le degr\u00e9 de m\u00e9fiance qui r\u00e9gnait au bureau \u00e9tait assez \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour que Mme Elijah affirme dans son t\u00e9moignage que c'\u00e9tait l'\u00e9criture de Mme Schuyler qui figurait sur le papillon adh\u00e9sif.\n[60] Selon Mme Schuyler, les gens ne voulaient pas qu'elle retourne travailler. Elle a attribu\u00e9 cela au fait qu'elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne en juillet 2001. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que le conseil n'aime pas \u00eatre poursuivi. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de l'attitude du conseil envers les parties dans d'autres instances. Mme Schuyler a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Le conseil n'aimait pas le fait que quiconque puisse le d\u00e9fier. M\u00eame si personne n'osait l'affirmer, ce sentiment \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent.\n[61] Les probl\u00e8mes se sont multipli\u00e9s. Une r\u00e9union sp\u00e9ciale du conseil fut tenue en d\u00e9cembre 2002 afin de s\u00e9parer les fonctions politiques et les fonctions administratives de la bande. Cette activit\u00e9 comprenait la s\u00e9paration du personnel politique d'avec le personnel administratif. Il semble que Mme Schuyler se soit oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 cette r\u00e9forme car elle aurait eu pour effet de soustraire certains membres de son personnel \u00e0 sa supervision.\n[62] Une r\u00e9union du conseil fut tenue le 7 janvier 2003 afin de r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au personnel qui existaient au pavillon de ressourcement. Mme Schuyler croyait que la question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e en 2001. Le chef Doxtator ne savait pas pourquoi il avait fallu attendre si longtemps pour que ces probl\u00e8mes soient port\u00e9s \u00e0 l'attention du conseil. Le conseil a donn\u00e9 un avertissement oral \u00e0 Mme Schuyler quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle elle avait r\u00e9gl\u00e9 les probl\u00e8mes. Mme Schuyler a re\u00e7u une lettre deux semaines plus tard.\n[63] Il est \u00e9vident qu'il y avait des probl\u00e8mes plus profonds. Certains de ces probl\u00e8mes \u00e9taient li\u00e9s \u00e0 la personnalit\u00e9, mais il y avait plus que cela. L'intim\u00e9e adopte le point de vue que Mme Schuyler n'\u00e9tait pas capable de faire son travail. Selon Mme Schuyler, le conseil cherchait des pr\u00e9textes pour la r\u00e9primander. On la tenait responsable de tout. Elle \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un rien. Ce fut le d\u00e9but de son calvaire.\n(i) L'occupation : le 7 mars 2003 [64] Puis, il y a eu l'occupation. La police provinciale avait obtenu la permission d'effectuer une enqu\u00eate pour homicide sur la r\u00e9serve. La police est arriv\u00e9e le 7 mars 2003 avec au moins une douzaine d'hommes. Ce geste a irrit\u00e9 de nombreuses personnes. L'administration a re\u00e7u un d\u00e9luge d'appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. \u00c0 l'immeuble de l'administration, le chef traditionnel n'\u00e9tait pas capable de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tous les appels et il a quitt\u00e9 l'immeuble sous le coup de l'exasp\u00e9ration.\n[65] Il s'agissait d'une question de territoire. Les gens \u00e9taient en col\u00e8re parce que des v\u00e9hicules de la S\u00fbret\u00e9 provinciale de l'Ontario se trouvaient sur la r\u00e9serve. Le chef Doxtator a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que quatre ou cinq membres de la bande ont fini par se rendre \u00e0 l'immeuble de l'administration et ont dit \u00e0 tout le monde de s'en aller. Ils ont laiss\u00e9 entendre que les membres du personnel avaient besoin d'un cong\u00e9. L'un d'eux tenait une canne de six pieds de long et de deux pouces d'\u00e9pais. Il en donnait des coups sur le plancher.\n[66] Holly Elijah a les m\u00eames souvenirs. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que quatre hommes ont apport\u00e9 une sorte de gros b\u00e2ton, peut-\u00eatre une canne des condol\u00e9ances, et qu'ils ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 en donner des coups sur le plancher. Ils avaient bu, ils criaient, ils mena\u00e7aient les membres du personnel et ils leur disaient de quitter l'immeuble de l'administration. Ils voulaient que la police quitte la r\u00e9serve.\n[67] Le chef Doxtator a refus\u00e9 de s'en aller. Mme Elijah estimait que cela \u00e9tait dangereux. On a discut\u00e9 et on a pris la d\u00e9cision de quitter l'immeuble. \u00c0 16 h 30, la majorit\u00e9 des membres du personnel avaient quitt\u00e9 l'immeuble. Le chef Doxtator a fait le tour des bureaux afin de voir si tout le monde \u00e9tait parti. Il \u00e9tait la derni\u00e8re personne \u00e0 se trouver dans l'immeuble. Il voulait fermer l'immeuble. Toutefois, les hommes sont revenus et ils ont annonc\u00e9 qu'ils resteraient dans l'immeuble.\n[68] La crise s'est aggrav\u00e9e et, en fin de compte, des douzaines de protestataires ont occup\u00e9 le bureau principal de l'administration. Ils ont ensuite occup\u00e9 l'ensemble de l'\u00e9tablissement. On \u00e9tait le vendredi. La situation ne s'est pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9e avant le mardi ou le mercredi suivant. Environ 175 employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient en arr\u00eat de travail. Mme Elijah a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les membres du personnel furent traumatis\u00e9s. Ils s'\u00e9taient sentis physiquement menac\u00e9s.\n[69] Mme Elijah se sent toujours traumatis\u00e9e. Selon elle, le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait que personne n'\u00e9tait responsable et elle jette le bl\u00e2me sur Mme Schuyler, laquelle n'\u00e9tait pas rentr\u00e9e au bureau cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Mme Elijah trouve que cela \u00e9tait \u00e9trange : elle a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Schuyler n'avait jamais mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 qui que ce soit qu'elle serait absente. L'adjoint \u00e9tait \u00e9galement absent.\n[70] Apr\u00e8s l'occupation, on a tenu de nombreuses r\u00e9unions afin de s'occuper des probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s par les membres du personnel. Mme Elijah a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait r\u00e9barbative, voir m\u00eame d\u00e9daigneuse. Elle a trait\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s de [traduction] victimes et a affirm\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient tout simplement qu'\u00e0 retourner au travail. Mme Elijah affirme que ce fut le d\u00e9but de la fin. Les membres du personnel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 irrit\u00e9s par le fait que Mme Schuyler ne les ait pas appuy\u00e9s ou prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\n[71] Une r\u00e9union du personnel fut tenue dans les salles du conseil, quelques jours apr\u00e8s l'occupation. Mme Schulyer et M. Phillips ont discut\u00e9 en priv\u00e9 avant la r\u00e9union. M. Phillips a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Schulyer avait affirm\u00e9 que les gens se conduisaient comme des victimes. Il existe deux versions quant \u00e0 ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 lors de cette r\u00e9union. M. Phillips a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Schuyler a ensuite r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 ces remarques \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Cela a irrit\u00e9 un certain nombre des personnes qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes. Mme Schuyler a affirm\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait M. Phillips lui-m\u00eame qui avait fait cette remarque.\n[72] Apr\u00e8s l'occupation, on a offert des services de counseling personnel aux employ\u00e9s. On a \u00e9galement fait un cercle de gu\u00e9rison traditionnel, bien que, selon Mme Elijah, il ne s'agissait rien de plus que d'une occasion de se d\u00e9fouler. On n'a pas encore dig\u00e9r\u00e9 que Mme Schulyer n'ait pas voulu y aller pour [traduction] se vider le cur devant tout le monde. Elle voulait \u00e9laborer un plan visant \u00e0 faire face au genre de situation qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occupation.\n[73] Il y a \u00e9galement eu un d\u00e9saccord \u00e0 propos des membres du personnel qui avaient particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occupation. Mme Elijah voulait que ceux-ci fassent l'objet de mesures disciplinaires. Mme Schuyler estimait qu'il s'agissait d'une situation plus complexe et voulait que le conseil s'en occupe. La preuve n'est pas claire. Un t\u00e9moin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le conseil a d\u00fb ordonner \u00e0 Mme Schuyler de s'occuper de l'affaire.\n[74] Mme Schuyler, par contre, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le conseil s'\u00e9tait occup\u00e9 de la question des mesures disciplinaires sans la consulter. Cette situation a amen\u00e9 un certain nombre des membres de son personnel \u00e0 croire qu'elle avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occupation. Quoi qu'il en soit, l'occupation et les repr\u00e9sailles qui ont suivi ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration additionnelle des relations de travail de Mme Schuyler. Selon celle-ci, les membres de son personnel s'adressaient au conseil sans la pr\u00e9venir.\nE. Le cong\u00e9diement [75] Il est difficile de d\u00e9m\u00ealer ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 de ce que Mme Schuyler affirme qu'il s'est pass\u00e9, mais la situation s'est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s. Il y avait quelque chose en toile de fond dont personne ne parlait vraiment. Mme Schulyer se sentait invisible. Ses recommandations n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises au s\u00e9rieux. Les gens lui faisaient des sourires, mais il y avait toujours quelque chose d'autre qui arrivait.\n[76] Mme Schuyler est convaincue que le conseil ne voulait pas la voir au travail, et ce, parce qu'elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Le conseil cherchait une mani\u00e8re de se d\u00e9barrasser d'elle. Les membres du personnel sentaient que le conseil ne faisait pas confiance \u00e0 Mme Schuyler. Ils ont donc perdu confiance en elle. Ils ont pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle ne les appuyait pas.\n[77] Mme Schuyler a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 30 incidents de repr\u00e9sailles. Par exemple, il y a eu un conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats avec l'un des gestionnaires. Elle a eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9gler cette situation. Sa parole n'avait plus de pouvoir. Il y a un brin de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans tout cela, mais cela est att\u00e9nu\u00e9 par le fait que le chef et le conseil \u00e9prouvaient de v\u00e9ritables difficult\u00e9s avec le rendement au travail de Mme Schuyler.\n[78] Une r\u00e9union du conseil a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue le 6 mai 2003 afin de discuter du plan de s\u00e9paration des fonctions politiques et des fonctions administratives de la bande. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de ce plan, entreprise lors de cette m\u00eame r\u00e9union, consistait \u00e0 demander \u00e0 l'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 Mme Schuyler, d'assister aux r\u00e9unions du conseil le premier et le troisi\u00e8me mardi du mois. Mme Schuyler affirme que cette mesure visait tout simplement \u00e0 l'\u00e9carter des r\u00e9unions.\n[79] Mme Schuyler a eu le sentiment que l'on se moquait d'elle lorsqu'elle posait des questions au conseil. Elle s'est fait traiter d'indisciplin\u00e9e. Mme Schuyler estimait que la pr\u00e9sence aux r\u00e9unions faisait partie des responsabilit\u00e9s de l'administrateur ex\u00e9cutif. Le conseil a toutefois adopt\u00e9 le point de vue qu'il avait le pouvoir de modifier les responsabilit\u00e9s de l'administrateur ex\u00e9cutif et qu'il avait le droit de lui demander de ne pas assister aux r\u00e9unions.\n[80] Randy Phillips a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Schuyler de n'assister qu'\u00e0 la derni\u00e8re r\u00e9union du mois. Cela a men\u00e9 \u00e0 une altercation avec une conseill\u00e8re, Faye Antone, laquelle riait. Mme Schuyler lui a demand\u00e9 de ne pas se moquer d'elle. Mme Antone lui a r\u00e9pondu que le conseil \u00e9tait son employeur et qu'elle devait faire ce qu'on lui disait de faire. Il y a \u00e9galement eu un incident avec Mme Elijah.\n[81] Mme Schuyler s'est plainte que le conseil de bande avait retir\u00e9 Holly Elijah et Randy Phillips de sa supervision. M. Phillips a affirm\u00e9 que cela faisait partie d'un processus continu. En tant qu'analyste des politiques, il avait propos\u00e9 l'instauration d'un secr\u00e9tariat des politiques qui rel\u00e8verait directement du chef ainsi que du conseil. Cette id\u00e9e \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le fait que ses responsabilit\u00e9s relevaient plus de la politique que de l'administration et n'\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la livraison de programmes et de services.\n[82] Il est difficile de s'y retrouver dans l'expos\u00e9 des faits. La pagaille r\u00e9gnait en ma\u00eetre. Par exemple, Mme Schuyler a eu des probl\u00e8mes avec M. Stacey Phillips, lequel \u00e9tait un membre du personnel et un conseiller. Les deux se sont querell\u00e9s. M. Phillips n'acceptait pas que Mme Schuyler soit sa superviseure et il a continu\u00e9 de s'adresser directement au conseil sans la consulter.\n[83] Mme Schuyler pr\u00e9tend que le conseil a continu\u00e9 de s'occuper des questions administratives, et ce, malgr\u00e9 les discussions qu'on avait eues concernant la s\u00e9paration des fonctions de la bande. Une partie du probl\u00e8me provenait indubitablement du fait qu'il \u00e9tait loisible aux membres du personnel de si\u00e9ger au conseil, ce qui rendait leur supervision tr\u00e8s probl\u00e9matique. Les probl\u00e8mes qui existaient entre l'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive et les membres du personnel ont d\u00fb avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur les affaires du conseil.\n[84] Mme Schuyler d\u00e9sirait modifier la politique en mati\u00e8re de gestion du personnel afin d'emp\u00eacher que les conseillers puissent \u00eatre employ\u00e9s par la bande. L'intim\u00e9e affirme que l'article 5.8 du code \u00e9lectoral interdisait cette pratique. Mme Schuyler affirme que le code \u00e9lectoral n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. Par cons\u00e9quent, les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens s'appliquent.\n[85] Il existe un projet de code \u00e9lectoral fond\u00e9 sur la coutume dont le conseil a discut\u00e9 p\u00e9riodiquement. Holly Elijah a affirm\u00e9 que la bande tente de compl\u00e9ter le code depuis 12 ans. Une disposition, l'article 5.8, mentionne que les employ\u00e9s qui sont \u00e9lus chef ou conseiller doivent quitter l'emploi qu'ils occupent aupr\u00e8s de la bande. Le code \u00e9lectoral n'a toutefois pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 et, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque pertinente, les membres du personnel avaient le droit de se porter candidat comme conseiller.\n[86] Les mauvaises relations qui existaient entre plusieurs des diff\u00e9rentes personnes mentionn\u00e9es dans le r\u00e9cit ont \u00e9t\u00e9 empir\u00e9es par des rancunes personnelles. Il appert du t\u00e9moignage du chef Doxtator qu'il existait une sorte de rivalit\u00e9 entre Randy Phillips et Mme Schuyler. Le conseil n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec cela. Mme Schuyler pr\u00e9tend que M. Phillips a donn\u00e9 des renseignements en mati\u00e8re de financement directement aux gestionnaires de programme sans passer par son bureau. Il semble que ceux-ci se disputaient l'all\u00e9geance des gestionnaires.\n[87] Il semble qu'il y ait eu des probl\u00e8mes semblables entre Mme Schuyler et Mme Elijah. On pouvait sentir cela dans le ton de la voix et dans le langage corporel de Mme Elijah lorsqu'elle se trouvait \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. \u00c0 un certain moment lors du contre-interrogatoire, elle a refus\u00e9 de regarder Mme Schuyler et elle a parl\u00e9 de celle-ci \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me personne.\n[88] Quoi qu'il en soit, tout cela \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s personnel. Mme Schuyler s'est plainte, par exemple, que Randy Phillips avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire une partie de son travail \u00e0 la maison pendant un certain nombre de semaines afin de lui permettre de s'occuper de son p\u00e8re. Mme Schuyler a affirm\u00e9 que la bande ne l'a pas accommod\u00e9e comme elle l'avait fait pour M. Phillips.\n[89] Le niveau de d\u00e9tail est ahurissant. Il y a eu un probl\u00e8me entre Mme Schuyler et un conseiller concernant le financement du Casino-Rama. Il y a eu des d\u00e9saccords concernant les honoraires vers\u00e9s pour la pr\u00e9sence aux r\u00e9unions du conseil, concernant l'attribution d'emplois et concernant diverses autres questions.\n[90] La confusion r\u00e9gnait en ma\u00eetre. La fille de Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait l'administratrice de l'emploi et de la formation. Le conseil a tout naturellement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cette situation comme constituant un conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats et il ne voulait pas que celle-ci rel\u00e8ve de sa m\u00e8re. Elle a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e sous la supervision de M. Phillips, lequel relevait maintenant du conseil plut\u00f4t que de Mme Schuyler.\n[91] On ne s'est pas entendu concernant la divulgation de lettres dans lesquelles on se plaignait de Verna Brown. Il y a eu des diff\u00e9rends entre Cyndi White, la coordonnatrice en ressources humaines, et Mme Schuyler. Elles ne se faisaient pas confiance. Mme White croyait que Mme Schuyler, sa superviseure, r\u00e9visait les rapports qu'elle faisait au conseil. Elle s'est donc adress\u00e9e directement au conseil sans passer par Mme Schuyler.\n[92] Les choses ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer. Mme Schuyler n'\u00e9tait pas tenue inform\u00e9e de ce qui se passait au conseil. Elle n'avait plus acc\u00e8s au registre des proc\u00e8s-verbaux. La secr\u00e9taire du conseil, Mme Elijah, laquelle avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e de la supervision de Mme Schuyler, ne permettait pas \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de le consulter. Mme Elijah a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ob\u00e9issait aux directives du conseil. Les proc\u00e8s-verbaux des r\u00e9unions qui se tiennent \u00e0 huis clos ne doivent jamais sortir de l'immeuble.\n[93] Le chef Doxtator ne se souvient d'aucun conflit concernant le registre des proc\u00e8s-verbaux des r\u00e9unions tenues \u00e0 huis clos. Il ne voyait pas en quoi la directive selon laquelle Mme Schuyler ne devait se pr\u00e9senter aux r\u00e9unions du conseil que pour faire son rapport constituait une tentative d'exclusion. Celle-ci devait toujours se pr\u00e9senter aux r\u00e9unions lorsque l'on discutait de questions pour lesquelles on avait besoin de sa participation. Il ne consid\u00e9rait pas non plus la modification des exigences en mati\u00e8re de rapport auxquelles \u00e9taient soumis Holly Elijah et Randy Phillips comme constituant une tentative de miner l'autorit\u00e9 de Mme Schuyler.\n[94] Mme Schuyler a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'assister aux r\u00e9unions en tant que membre de la collectivit\u00e9. Cette strat\u00e9gie n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 bien accept\u00e9e. Ses relations avec le conseil se sont compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9es. En juillet, elle s'est plainte de la situation dans son rapport mensuel. Elle avait discut\u00e9 de la situation avec son avocat et elle a inform\u00e9 le conseil que la fa\u00e7on dont il s'\u00e9tait conduit \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 un cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9. Le conseil n'a pas souscris \u00e0 cette affirmation.\n[95] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il y avait beaucoup de querelles intestines. Toutefois, tout le monde semblait convenir que les conflits incessants et le litige en cours avaient empoisonn\u00e9 ce qu'il restait de relation entre Mme Schuyler et le conseil de bande. La preuve ne confirme pas l'all\u00e9gation que le cong\u00e9diement a eu lieu en repr\u00e9sailles au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[96] En ao\u00fbt 2003, des personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es ont occup\u00e9 le bureau du minist\u00e8re de la sant\u00e9, lequel est situ\u00e9 en face du bureau de l'administration, parce que la personne qui occupait le poste de coordonnateur des soins de longue dur\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue. Par cons\u00e9quent, un certain nombre de personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es, ainsi que d'autres personnes, ont occup\u00e9 l'immeuble. Mme Schuyler n'a pas bien g\u00e9r\u00e9 cette situation. On a d\u00fb appeler la police.\n[97] Le 21 ao\u00fbt 2003, Mme Schuyler a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Peters, l'avocat de la bande, par une lettre de son avocat. Il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans cette lettre que le traitement de la plaignante par la bande constituait des repr\u00e9sailles parce que celle-ci avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[98] On s'est interrog\u00e9 quant \u00e0 savoir si Mme Schuyler faisait son travail \u00e0 la suite de la question des r\u00e9unions du conseil. L'affaire \u00e9tait assez s\u00e9rieuse pour que, le 9 juillet 2003, le chef \u00e9crive une lettre \u00e0 Mme Schuyler au nom du conseil dans laquelle il lui ordonnait de se pr\u00e9senter au conseil tel que demand\u00e9. Cette lettre servait de deuxi\u00e8me avertissement.\n[99] Une r\u00e9union du conseil a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue le 28 ao\u00fbt 2003 afin de discuter du rendement de Mme Schuyler. On a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une motion visant \u00e0 cong\u00e9dier cette derni\u00e8re de son poste d'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal fait \u00e9tat de 11 cas de mauvaise conduite. On ne l\u00e9sine pas sur les mots. Les deux premiers cas renvoient \u00e0 des actes d'insolence. Le cas suivant renvoie \u00e0 des actes d'insubordination. On renvoie \u00e9galement au manquement qu'elle aurait eu \u00e0 son devoir de loyaut\u00e9 et de bonne foi envers le conseil et on renvoie \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle elle traitait les membres du personnel.\n[100] Ensuite, on fait mention de plaintes s\u00e9rieuses, la plus importante \u00e9tant une all\u00e9gation que Mme Schuyler n'aurait pas accompli [traduction] au-del\u00e0 de 100 t\u00e2ches que le conseil l'aurait charg\u00e9e d'accomplir au cours des cinq ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Une liste distincte, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise aux membres du conseil avant la r\u00e9union, fait \u00e9tat de 41 t\u00e2ches administratives non accomplies entre 2002 et 2003, dont 38 exigeaient des actions de la part de l'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive. Les t\u00e2ches allaient de la mise en place d'un programme insectifuge \u00e0 une proposition d'achat d'un nouveau camion \u00e0 incendie, \u00e0 la distribution de listes du comit\u00e9.\n[101] Le chef Doxtator a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 la r\u00e9union du 28 ao\u00fbt. Il estime que les inqui\u00e9tudes exprim\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9union \u00e9taient valables. Elles refl\u00e8tent la situation plut\u00f4t d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e qui existait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait ergoteuse et contrariante lors de ses discussions avec le conseil. La confiance n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9servation de bonnes relations de travail \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement absente. Il y avait de l'insubordination. Il n'y avait aucune coop\u00e9ration. Il y avait des probl\u00e8mes avec le moral des membres du personnel.\n[102] Le chef Doxtator a convenu qu'il existait [traduction] un climat empoisonn\u00e9 au bureau. Il a toutefois tenu Mme Schuyler responsable de cette situation. On n'a aucunement tent\u00e9 d'obliger cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 quitter. Il y a eu un certain nombre de confrontations \u00e0 la table du conseil mais, selon lui, le conseil n'a pas mal trait\u00e9 Mme Schuyler. Le conseil n'avait jamais autant re\u00e7u de plaintes concernant un administrateur ex\u00e9cutif. On n'a pas discut\u00e9 de la maladie de Mme Schulyer ou de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission des droits de la personne.\n[103] Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la r\u00e9union n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par le conseil. Il semble que cela soit d\u00fb \u00e0 un oubli. Mme Elijah, qui a consign\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s-verbal, affirme que les mots utilis\u00e9s dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal \u00e9taient appropri\u00e9s. Ils d\u00e9crivaient l'attitude de Mme Schuyler. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le cong\u00e9diement n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec la maladie de Mme Schuyler. M. Phillips a adopt\u00e9 le m\u00eame point de vue.\n[104] Le 4 septembre, apr\u00e8s la fin de semaine de la F\u00eate du travail, Mme Schuyler est retourn\u00e9e travailler. Le chef Doxtator lui a remis une lettre de cong\u00e9diement. La lettre faisait \u00e9tat d'un certain nombre de raisons justifiant son cong\u00e9diement. Le chef a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Schuyler qu'il s'agissait d'une d\u00e9cision irr\u00e9m\u00e9diable et celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 escort\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 la sortie. Ce geste a mis un terme \u00e0 la relation troubl\u00e9e que Mme Schuyler entretenait avec le conseil.\n[105] La lettre de cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait dat\u00e9e du 2 septembre 2003. Le ton de la lettre \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s s\u00e9v\u00e8re. Celle-ci faisait \u00e9tat de 11 formes d'inconduite, dont des actes d'insolence continus et des manquements au devoir de loyaut\u00e9 et de bonne foi. Mme Schulyer rejette l'ensemble de ces all\u00e9gations. On lui offrait, dans la lettre, une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part de sept mois. On lui demandait de signer une renonciation dans laquelle il \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 que toute plainte qu'elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ou du Code canadien du travail \u00e9tait frivole, vexatoire et constituait un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[106] Toute cette histoire est bien triste. L'avocat de Mme Schuyler a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 celle-ci d'accepter le r\u00e8glement. Elle a refus\u00e9. Le probl\u00e8me n'\u00e9tait pas la question de l'argent. Selon elle, le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait que les all\u00e9gations \u00e9taient injustes. Elle avait fait l'objet d'une discrimination silencieuse. Elle a refus\u00e9 de signer la d\u00e9charge. Par la suite, elle s'est sentie isol\u00e9e. Certains membres du personnel et certains membres de la collectivit\u00e9 ne lui parlaient plus.\n[107] \u00c0 l'automne 2003, Mme Schuyler a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une autre plainte, cette fois-ci en vertu du Code canadien du travail. Elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, laquelle comprenait des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, le 20 janvier 2004.\nIII. LES QUESTIONS D'ORDRE JURIDIQUE A. Les repr\u00e9sailles [108] La deuxi\u00e8me plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur le droits de la personne, lequel est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n14.1 Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d'exercer ou de menacer d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\nIl existe un d\u00e9bat juridique \u00e0 propos des exigences relatives aux repr\u00e9sailles.\n[109] La jurisprudence a adopt\u00e9 deux positions. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par le membre Deschamps dans la d\u00e9cision Virk c. Bell Canada (Ontario), 2005 TCDP 2 (2005\/01\/20), paragraphe 156 :\n[156] L'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles comporte une certaine forme d'acte volontaire visant \u00e0 infliger un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cette plainte. Ce point de vue d\u00e9roge en partie \u00e0 ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal sur la question des repr\u00e9sailles (Wong c. Banque Royale du Canada, [2001] TCDP 11; Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et de Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 40).\n[157] Dans Wong et Bressette, les points de vue exprim\u00e9s portent qu'un plaignant n'a pas \u00e0 prouver une intention d'exercer des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles et que si un plaignant per\u00e7oit raisonnablement que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 constitue des repr\u00e9sailles contre la plainte relative aux droits de la personne, il pourrait \u00e9galement s'agir de repr\u00e9sailles, nonobstant l'absence de toute preuve de l'intention de l'intim\u00e9.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\nIl serait peut-\u00eatre possible de trouver un certain appui pour ce dernier point de vue dans le fait que la discrimination n'est pas une faute intentionnelle.\n[110] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour les autres points de vue, je crois que l'interpr\u00e9tation de M. Deschamps est la bonne :\n[158] C'est au plaignant qu'incombe le fardeau de prouver qu'il y a eu repr\u00e9sailles et celui-ci doit prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la personne qu'il pr\u00e9tend avoir exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9tait au courant de l'existence de la plainte, que cette personne a agi d'une mani\u00e8re inopportune et que l'inconduite de cette personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte relative aux droits de la personne par le plaignant. Les repr\u00e9sailles constituant une forme de discrimination en vertu de la Loi, le m\u00eame fardeau de la preuve devrait s'appliquer aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles.\nJ'ajouterais que le mot repr\u00e9sailles doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 selon son sens ordinaire. On doit mettre en doute la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d'un processus qui est difficile \u00e0 comprendre par une personne ordinaire.\n[111] Bien que M. Deschamps conclue ensuite que les repr\u00e9sailles constituent une forme de discrimination, il s'agit d'une forme particuli\u00e8re de discrimination qui comporte ses propres exigences. La seule observation que je ferais est que les r\u00e8gles d'interpr\u00e9tation des lois doivent \u00eatre observ\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce comme dans les autres instances. L'article fait mention d'une personne qui exerce des repr\u00e9sailles dans le sens ordinaire de ce mot. La d\u00e9finition du mot repr\u00e9sailles qui figure dans le dictionnaire en ligne Merriam-Webster met l'accent sur la notion de vengeance. Je crois que cela est suffisant aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\nIV. L'ANALYSE A. LA PREMI\u00c8RE PLAINTE [112] La premi\u00e8re question \u00e0 trancher consiste \u00e0 savoir si l'intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Mme Schuyler en mai 2002 en ne prenant aucune mesure d'accommodement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard? Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'entreprendre une analyse de la preuve prima facie, laquelle a facilement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n(i) Mme Schuyler a-t-elle collabor\u00e9 au processus? [113] L'intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve deux d\u00e9fenses. La premi\u00e8re est tout simplement qu'elle a agi de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et responsable, et ce, en conformit\u00e9 avec la loi.\n[114] Mme Schuyler affirme qu'elle ne cherchait tout simplement qu'\u00e0 retourner travailler \u00e0 mi-temps. Elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 accepter des projets individuels et ne d\u00e9sirait aucunement modifier les mesures d'ordre administratif provisoires. La bande affirme que c'est justement ce qu'elle lui a offert. Elle affirme que Mme Schuyler a alors cess\u00e9 de communiquer avec elle.\n[115] M. Peters affirme que la lettre de la bande des Oneidas du 12 juin 2002 r\u00e9pondait aux demandes de Mme Schuyler. On lui accordait dans cette lettre un horaire flexible. Il y figurait une description d'emploi afin que celle-ci puisse l'examiner attentivement. Il s'agissait-l\u00e0 d'une premier pas. Il y avait place \u00e0 d'autres n\u00e9gociations. M. Peters a invoqu\u00e9 l'arr\u00eat Central Okanagan School District no 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le plaignant doit participer \u00e0 la recherche d'un compromis et doit faciliter cette recherche. La recherche d'un compromis fait intervenir plusieurs parties.\n[116] L'intim\u00e9e affirme que Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait tenue de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la lettre de la bande. Au lieu de faire cela, elle a retenu les services d'un avocat qui a inform\u00e9 la bande par \u00e9crit qu'elle \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement invalide. Je crois que cela est trop simple : selon moi, Mme Schuyler s'est sentie rejet\u00e9e, ce qui est tout \u00e0 fait compr\u00e9hensible. L'interpr\u00e9tation des faits de l'intim\u00e9e ne tient pas compte du facteur le plus important du processus, c'est-\u00e0-dire du message clair que la bande a envoy\u00e9 : elle ne voulait pas que Mme Schuyler retourne travailler.\n[117] Il est tout simplement erron\u00e9 de tenir Mme Schuyler responsable de l'\u00e9chec des n\u00e9gociations. L\u00e9galement, c'est \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e qu'incombait la t\u00e2che principale de trouver une mani\u00e8re de ramener Mme Schuyler au travail. Les n\u00e9gociations avec le comit\u00e9 du personnel et le contrat envisag\u00e9 n'ont pas respect\u00e9 ce fait. Le contrat ne reconnaissait pas l'anciennet\u00e9 de Mme Schuyler et la clause relative \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode probatoire \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait injustifi\u00e9e. \u00c0 part les difficult\u00e9s naturelles que quiconque \u00e9prouverait apr\u00e8s une intervention m\u00e9dicale importante, le processus \u00e9tait irrespectueux envers une personne qui occupe un poste aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[118] Je suis d'accord avec Mme Schuyler : la bande ne voulait pas vraiment qu'elle retourne travailler et elle lui a transmis ce renseignement de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res. Un employeur qui aurait sinc\u00e8rement voulu l'accommoder en aurait fait beaucoup plus pour tenter de trouver une solution qui satisferait les deux parties. Je r\u00e9alise qu'il s'agissait d'une situation difficile pour les deux parties : Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait m\u00e9fiante, hostile et voulait que les choses se r\u00e8glent \u00e0 sa fa\u00e7on. Je suis n\u00e9anmoins convaincu que la bande ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9e de l'obligation qui lui incombait d'accommoder Mme Schuyler.\n[119] En l'esp\u00e8ce, comme dans d'autres instances, le diff\u00e9rend relatif \u00e0 l'emploi \u00e9tait ce qu'il y avait de plus important. Il ne fait aucun doute que la bande \u00e9tait insatisfaite du rendement de Mme Schuyler en tant qu'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive. L'examen du rendement a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompu et n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re satisfaisante. Plut\u00f4t que de s'occuper de ces aspects de l'affaire-d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable, responsable et transparente-l'intim\u00e9e s'est content\u00e9e de laisser Mme Schuyler prendre un cong\u00e9 d'invalidit\u00e9. Il s'agissait d'une fa\u00e7on facile de se sortir de la situation.\n(ii) La pr\u00e9clusion [120] M. Peters invoque toutefois un autre argument. Il affirme que Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement invalide. L'intim\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait donc pas tenue de l'accommoder. Je suppose qu'il s'agit d'une forme de pr\u00e9clusion fond\u00e9e sur la conduite. Mme Schuyler a re\u00e7u des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein. M. Peters affirme qu'elle ne peut pas accepter ces prestations et pr\u00e9tendre qu'elle \u00e9tait partiellement invalide et \u00e9tait capable de retourner travailler \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[121] Il n'y a pas lieu d'examiner tous les points de d\u00e9tail de l'affaire. Mme Schuyler n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s que les n\u00e9gociations furent rompues. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, Mme Schuyler se sentait rejet\u00e9e, elle \u00e9tait m\u00e9fiante et n'avait pas le cur \u00e0 discuter davantage. Elle devait s'occuper de sa sant\u00e9 et le stress psychologique occasionn\u00e9 par des n\u00e9gociations avec la bande \u00e9tait trop lourd \u00e0 supporter.\n[122] Je ne veux pas dramatiser la situation et j'accepte qu'un certain nombre des personnes qui ont particip\u00e9 au processus se pr\u00e9occupaient vraiment du bien-\u00eatre de Mme Schuyler. L'indiff\u00e9rence et la mauvaise volont\u00e9 l'ont toutefois emport\u00e9. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, les actes de la bande ont contribu\u00e9 aux circonstances qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'invalidit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te de Mme Schuyler. On aurait tort de laisser l'intim\u00e9e utiliser ce fait contre Mme Schuyler afin d'\u00e9chapper \u00e0 ses obligations.\n(iii) Conclusions [123] Je souscris \u00e0 l'argument de M. Peters qu'il y a des limites \u00e0 l'obligation d'accommodement. Selon lui, [traduction] l'intim\u00e9e n'est pas tenue d'aider Mme Schuyler \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer de son cancer. Il y a des limites, et dans la plupart des cas, \u00e0 tout le moins, le processus d'accommodement et le processus de r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration sont indissociables. Je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 affirmer qu'un employeur est tenu par la loi de faire preuve de consid\u00e9ration, mais il est tenu d'\u00eatre juste et raisonnable et, dans de nombreux cas, je pense que cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la m\u00eame chose.\n[124] Il y a un aspect pratique \u00e0 ceci : je suis d'avis que l'empathie, \u00e0 un certain degr\u00e9, constitue un \u00e9l\u00e9ment indispensable du processus d'accommodement. Il r\u00e9sulte de ceci qu'un intim\u00e9 est tenu de tenir compte de la situation du plaignant dans sa recherche d'une forme d'accommodement appropri\u00e9e. Un employeur qui adopte une approche antagoniste envers une personne qui a subi une crise m\u00e9dicale ou psychologique importante et qui envoie un message clair \u00e0 cette personne qu'elle n'est pas bienvenue contrevient probablement \u00e0 son obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes handicap\u00e9es.\n[125] La situation \u00e0 laquelle les deux parties \u00e9taient confront\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait difficile pour chacune d'elle. Celles-ci sont sorties au beau milieu de l'examen du rendement et n'ont pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9 leurs affaires. L'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait n\u00e9anmoins oblig\u00e9e de participer de fa\u00e7on sinc\u00e8re au processus d'accommodement et de rechercher s\u00e9rieusement une solution qui r\u00e9pondrait aux besoins de Mme Schuyler. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas fait preuve de la bonne foi la plus compl\u00e8te en n\u00e9gociant. Cela constitue de la discrimination et viole la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La premi\u00e8re plainte est fond\u00e9e.\nB. LA DEUXI\u00c8ME PLAINTE [126] La deuxi\u00e8me question \u00e0 trancher consiste \u00e0 savoir si l'intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles? Je ne sais trop quoi dire quant \u00e0 la preuve prima facie dans ce contexte car j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 discut\u00e9 de ce sujet en d\u00e9tails dans une autre instance. Y-avait-il une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles? Peut-\u00eatre. Cela transf\u00e8rerait-il le fardeau de la preuve \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e? Aucunement. La seule question suscit\u00e9e par la preuve est donc de savoir si la plaignante a prouv\u00e9 selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination?\n[127] Mme Schuyler a fait environ 30 all\u00e9gations dont la plupart suivent la longue s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement. Mme Schuyler attribue apparemment tous ces \u00e9v\u00e8nements, ainsi que le cong\u00e9diement, \u00e0 son d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte initiale. Il est vrai qu'elle a apport\u00e9 une certaine nuance lorsqu'elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses observations et qu'elle a adopt\u00e9 le point de vue qu'il s'agissait de l'un des facteurs qui avait men\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision. Le r\u00e9sultat est le m\u00eame : selon elle, s'il n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, elle aurait pu s'asseoir avec le chef et le conseil et r\u00e9gler les autres probl\u00e8mes.\n[128] Selon moi, cette vue de la situation est plut\u00f4t na\u00efve. Mme Schuyler a ni\u00e9 l'\u00e9vidence. Selon M. Peters, les relations entre Mme Schuyler et le conseil de bande ont commenc\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but \u00e0 se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer de fa\u00e7on importante. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9valuation \u00e9tait symptomatique. Les pr\u00e9occupations de la bande n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es convenablement. Les choses allaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 mal lorsque Mme Schuyler a d\u00e9couvert qu'elle \u00e9tait atteinte du cancer et elles ne pouvaient qu'empirer. La relation a continu\u00e9 de se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer lorsqu'elle est retourn\u00e9e au travail.\n[129] Le t\u00e9moignage du chef Doxtator, que j'accepte, suffit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'emploi qui existaient entre les deux parties \u00e9taient r\u00e9els. Ces probl\u00e8mes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s ailleurs et doivent \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9s des all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il existait un climat plus large qui \u00e9tait marqu\u00e9 par la rancur et il y a tr\u00e8s peu d'indications que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne avait quelque chose \u00e0 voir avec cette situation. Il n'y a aucune preuve de repr\u00e9sailles, mis \u00e0 part le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Schuyler.\n[130] La premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation est que Mme Schuyler n'a pas retrouv\u00e9 ses pleins pouvoirs lorsqu'elle est retourn\u00e9e travailler comme administratrice ex\u00e9cutive. Cela fait allusion au fait qu'elle a partag\u00e9 l'emploi avec Holly Elijah pendant deux mois. Le conseil de bande offre une explication raisonnable : il affirme que Mme Elijah a conserv\u00e9 le poste pour son avantage ainsi que pour assurer une transition ad\u00e9quate. Je comprends que Mme Schuyler ait eu des soup\u00e7ons mais rien ne permet de lier cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte initiale.\n[131] La deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation avait trait \u00e0 la mesure disciplinaire relative \u00e0 ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 au pavillon de ressourcement. Cette affaire, qui n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, date du mandat initial de Mme Schuyler en tant qu'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive. Il est vrai que Mme Schuyler entretenait une relation de plus en plus marqu\u00e9e par l'hostilit\u00e9 avec le conseil et cette relation ne s'est pas am\u00e9lior\u00e9e avec le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Mais rien dans ces exemples pr\u00e9cis ne peut \u00eatre li\u00e9s au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[132] Il n'est gu\u00e8re opportun que l'on examine les 30 all\u00e9gations qui figurent dans la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles et qui font toutes ressortir l'existence d'une relation tr\u00e8s troubl\u00e9e. Il y avait par exemple un diff\u00e9rend persistant quant \u00e0 savoir s'il convenait que l'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive assiste au r\u00e9union du conseil. On peut se demander pourquoi le conseil exclurait l'administratrice ex\u00e9cutive des r\u00e9unions. Mais le chef et le conseil avaient un point de vue diff\u00e9rent : c'\u00e9tait parce que Mme Schuyler \u00e9tait obs\u00e9d\u00e9e par la question et qu'elle devait se concentrer sur son propre travail.\n[133] La seule question dont je suis saisi consiste \u00e0 savoir si cela constituait des repr\u00e9sailles. Bien qu'il soit difficile pour un tiers de comprendre l'ampleur ou l'intensit\u00e9 du conflit existant entre Mme Schuyler et le conseil, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage que, selon le conseil, Mme Schuyler avait outrepass\u00e9 ses limites. La d\u00e9cision d'ordonner \u00e0 Mme Schuyler de ne pas assister aux r\u00e9unions du conseil refl\u00e9tait \u00e0 tout le moins la relation de plus en plus hostile qui existait entre le conseil et Mme Schuyler. Ils ne pouvaient tout simplement pas travailler ensemble.\n[134] Il importe peu combien on dilue le concept de repr\u00e9sailles. La simple question dont je suis saisi dans le cadre de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte consiste \u00e0 savoir si les mesures que la bande a prises contre Mme Schuyler, notamment le cong\u00e9diement, constituaient une forme de repr\u00e9sailles. La preuve indique le contraire. L'id\u00e9e que le conseil s'est veng\u00e9 d'elle lorsqu'il a trait\u00e9 les questions relatives au personnel, les plaintes \u00e9manant des membres du personnel, les questions relatives aux \u00e9lections, les probl\u00e8mes qui existaient au pavillon de ressourcement, les \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant l'occupation et une foule d'autres questions, n'est tout simplement pas cr\u00e9dible.\n[135] J'accepte donc le point de vue suivant que l'intim\u00e9e a avanc\u00e9 dans ses observations \u00e9crites :\n[traduction]\nIl ressort clairement du t\u00e9moignage des deux parties qu'il y a eu rupture de la relation qui existait entre la plaignante et l'intim\u00e9e. En cons\u00e9quence de la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la relation, la plaignante a fait l'objet d'un cong\u00e9diement motiv\u00e9.\nEt ailleurs :\n[traduction]\nEn bout de ligne, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e parce qu'elle ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences continuelles de son poste et parce que les relations entre la plaignante et l'intim\u00e9e s'\u00e9taient manifestement d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9es.\nJ'affirme ceci sans trancher aucune des questions relatives \u00e0 l'emploi, lesquelles ne sont pas de mon ressort.\nV. LES MESURES R\u00c9PARATRICES [136] Un certain nombre de questions ont trait aux mesures r\u00e9paratrices. Deux de ces mesures sont de nature exceptionnelle.\nA. Les questions pr\u00e9liminaires (i) L'offre de r\u00e8glement [137] M. Peters affirme qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de tenir une audience. Il affirme cela parce qu'une offre de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et que, selon lui, cette offre suffisait \u00e0 r\u00e9gler la question. Il pr\u00e9tend que l'on devrait tenir compte de cela en fixant le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9. Cela comprend les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audience.\n[138] La preuve relative \u00e0 l'offre est fragmentaire et ne couvre que la r\u00e9clamation relative \u00e0 l'emploi. Elle figure dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 2 septembre 2003 dans laquelle on offre \u00e0 Mme Schuyler une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part de 11 mois en plus des paiements pr\u00e9vus par la loi, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'elle ait fait l'objet d'un cong\u00e9diement motiv\u00e9. Je ne sais rien ou presque rien quant aux circonstances de l'offre et la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e essentiellement par erreur. Mme Schuyler n'\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat.\n[139] Mme Schuyler a apparemment rejet\u00e9 l'offre. M. Peters pr\u00e9tend n\u00e9anmoins que la renonciation annex\u00e9e renvoie pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 toute plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Elle constitue par cons\u00e9quent une offre de r\u00e8glement-ou comprend une offre de r\u00e8glement-de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Je crois qu'il est exag\u00e9r\u00e9 de tirer cette conclusion.\n[140] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit un m\u00e9canisme de r\u00e8glement des plaintes qui exige l'approbation de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Il me semble que, \u00e0 tout le moins dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, on aurait tort de donner effet \u00e0 une tentative de r\u00e8glement d'une affaire connexe li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'emploi, sur une base contractuelle, qui ne tient pas compte de la Loi et dont les modalit\u00e9s ne traitent pas express\u00e9ment de la question de la discrimination.\n[141] Il semble clair que l'offre touche principalement la perte de salaire plut\u00f4t que le pr\u00e9judice moral. L'offre serait peut-\u00eatre pertinente si Mme Schuyler demandait \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e pour des pertes de salaire. Elle a toutefois renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 cette r\u00e9clamation. Je suis \u00e9galement convaincu que l'offre ne satisfait pas aux exigences des principes de droit relatif aux d\u00e9pens lesquels exigent une indication tr\u00e8s explicite que l'on se fondera sur l'offre lorsque l'on traitera de la question des d\u00e9pens. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 l'affaire, je ne crois pas qu'il serait juste ou appropri\u00e9 d'examiner l'offre de r\u00e8glement en traitant de la question des mesures r\u00e9paratrices.\n(ii) La demande de d\u00e9pens pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e [142] Une autre affaire exceptionnelle m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre examin\u00e9e : l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que la CCDP soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer les d\u00e9pens. Le Tribunal est une instance constitu\u00e9e par la loi dont les pouvoirs sont attribu\u00e9s par la loi et il ne me para\u00eet pas \u00e9vident que je poss\u00e8de la comp\u00e9tence d'adjuger ces d\u00e9pens.\n[143] Les facteurs de principe qui s'appliquent dans le cas des plaignants ne s'appliquent pas dans le cas des intim\u00e9s. Je crois qu'il ressort de la jurisprudence que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit un processus dans lequel les plaignants peuvent faire valoir leurs plaintes sans craindre d'\u00eatre p\u00e9nalis\u00e9s par des d\u00e9pens. La Loi vise \u00e0 encourager les plaignants \u00e0 d\u00e9poser leurs plaintes.\n[144] Bien que j'estime qu'il est injuste de refuser d'adjuger des d\u00e9pens en faveur d'un intim\u00e9 dans une instance o\u00f9 la plainte est de nature vexatoire et d\u00e9pourvue de tout fondement, le pouvoir d'adjuger des d\u00e9pens est un pouvoir pr\u00e9vu par la loi. Je crois qu'il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reconnu que le l\u00e9gislateur a sciemment d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en adoptant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de ne pas accorder aux intim\u00e9s le droit aux d\u00e9pens. Il faudrait que la Loi soit modifi\u00e9e pour que l'on puisse accorder des d\u00e9pens aux intim\u00e9s.\n[145] La situation est aggrav\u00e9e par le fait que la CCDP n'a pas comparu devant le Tribunal et qu'elle n'a pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de l'intim\u00e9e. Peut-\u00eatre suffit-il que j'affirme que je ne vois rien dans les faits qui me sont soumis qui justifierait une adjudication exceptionnelle des d\u00e9pens, m\u00eame si cela \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu par la Loi. Je ne sais pas de quelle autre mani\u00e8re ce genre de d\u00e9pens pourraient \u00eatre recouvr\u00e9s.\nB. Les r\u00e9clamations de Mme Schuyler (i) Les pertes de salaire [146] Mme Schuyler a initialement r\u00e9clam\u00e9 qu'on lui verse ses revenus \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 elle a perdu son emploi jusqu'au jour o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise. Elle voulait \u00e9galement recevoir une forme d'indemnisation pour perte de possibilit\u00e9. Toutefois, elle a maintenant trouv\u00e9 un emploi aupr\u00e8s de l'Union of Ontario Indians et elle a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 ces r\u00e9clamations \u00e0 la fin de l'audience.\n(ii) Le pr\u00e9judice moral [147] La r\u00e9clamation principale a trait au pr\u00e9judice moral. J'accepte que Mme Schuyler a profond\u00e9ment souffert de la discrimination.\n[148] Il y a un aspect personnel et un aspect social au pr\u00e9judice moral que Mme Schuyler a endur\u00e9. Les actes initiaux de l'intim\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9s par le manque de consid\u00e9ration. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas fait preuve de la d\u00e9licatesse et de la compr\u00e9hension exig\u00e9es par la situation. Mme Schuyler a v\u00e9cu une situation de vie ou de mort. Elle avait droit \u00e0 une certaine d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 l'emploi, en tant qu'administratrice en chef. Cette exp\u00e9rience a \u00e9t\u00e9 encore plus \u00e9prouvante compte tenu de l'\u00e2ge de Mme Schuyler et compte tenu des \u00e9preuves physiques occasionn\u00e9es par son cancer.\n[149] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, Mme Schuyler mentionne que le stress dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime en mai 2002 a eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur les traitements de chimioth\u00e9rapie qu'elle recevait. Cela ne fait aucun doute : le stress a manifestement eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur tout ce qu'elle a v\u00e9cu. Je crois \u00e9galement que Mme Schuyler a droit \u00e0 une certaine forme d'indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de dignit\u00e9 qu'elle a subie, laquelle \u00e9tait manifeste. Selon elle, le processus a eu le m\u00eame effet sur elle que si [traduction] on lui avait enlev\u00e9 la peau morceau par morceau; il l'a rendue tout \u00e0 fait vuln\u00e9rable au point de vue \u00e9motif.\n[150] Il y a eu les questions familiales qui ont accompagn\u00e9 tout cela. Mme Schuyler a subi une perte de statut social. Elle a d\u00e9couvert plus tard que les autres membres de la bande \u00e9taient sous l'impression qu'elle avait fait quelque chose de mal et qu'on l'avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Elle se sent toujours mal \u00e0 l'aise de sortir parce qu'elle croit que les gens fuient son regard ou cherchent \u00e0 l'\u00e9viter lorsqu'elle approche d'eux. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a soulign\u00e9 qu'il n'existe aucune preuve objective de cela, mais je ne crois pas qu'il voulait mettre en doute les sentiments de Mme Schuyler.\na) La part de responsabilit\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9e par la conduite de Mme Schuyler [151] Tout ceci am\u00e8ne deux pr\u00e9cisions. La premi\u00e8re pr\u00e9cision est que les \u00e9motions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9es par les questions de l'emploi sont une autre affaire. Je ne peux qu'estimer, de mani\u00e8re approximative, ce que Mme Schuyler a v\u00e9cu \u00e0 la suite de la discrimination.\n[152] La deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00e9cision est qu'il y avait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d'antagonisme dans le comportement de Mme Schuyler. Il n'y a pas \u00e0 en sortir : Mme Schuyler doit assumer une part de responsabilit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la relation hostile qui s'est \u00e9tablie entre elle et la bande. L'attitude, d'une part comme de l'autre, \u00e9tait de nature hostile. Mme Schuyler a \u00e9t\u00e9 prompte \u00e0 retenir les services d'un avocat et a menac\u00e9 d'intenter des poursuites.\n[153] Mme Schuyler a soulev\u00e9 des questions de nature politique en rapport avec les premi\u00e8res nations. Il ne fait aucun doute qu'elle s'est trouv\u00e9e prise dans une sorte de lutte politique au sein de la bande des Oneidas. Les parties ont adopt\u00e9 des points de vue diff\u00e9rents quant aux responsabilit\u00e9s du chef administrateur et quant \u00e0 celles du conseil de bande. Cela fut aggrav\u00e9 par l'aversion mutuelle que les deux parties avaient l'une pour l'autre. Ces aversions se sont traduites, au dire de tous, par de l'indiff\u00e9rence, des intrigues politiques, voire m\u00eame par de l'outrage.\n[154] Aucune des deux parties n'a sembl\u00e9 faire preuve de dignit\u00e9 et de compr\u00e9hension. Je comprends mal pourquoi car il ne semble pas y avoir de v\u00e9ritables raisons pour cela. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage du chef Doxtator, lequel, j'en suis certain, comprend mieux la situation que moi. Il me semble que les parties n'ont pas respect\u00e9 le fait que notre dignit\u00e9 repose, en fin de compte, sur la reconnaissance que chaque personne a une valeur et qu'elle m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme les autres, peu importe les d\u00e9saccords que l'on peut avoir avec elle. Cette id\u00e9e est consacr\u00e9e dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nb) CCDP [155] Une autre question est soulev\u00e9e dans le contexte du pr\u00e9judice moral. Le fait le plus troublant est que Mme Schuyler a tenu la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en grande partie responsable de ce qui lui est arriv\u00e9. Elle se sent apparemment trahie par la CCDP et estime que celle-ci n'aurait pas d\u00fb la laisser s'engager seule dans ce litige. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle revivait son \u00e9preuve les soirs et les fins de semaine lorsqu'elle pr\u00e9parait sa cause. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que cela fut tr\u00e8s p\u00e9nible. Elle a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit [traduction] : Cela \u00e9tait comme avoir le cancer. \u00c0 bien des \u00e9gards, je crois que c'est pire. J'ai surv\u00e9cu au cancer. Il me faudra encore beaucoup plus de temps pour survivre \u00e0 cela.\n[156] Je ne peux dire que tr\u00e8s peu de chose quant \u00e0 cet aspect de l'affaire. Je n'ai eu aucune nouvelle de la CCDP et le Tribunal n'a aucun pouvoir, pour autant que je sache, d'exiger que la CCDP comparaisse. Le point de vue le plus important, comme l'a mentionn\u00e9 M. Peters, est que l'intim\u00e9e ne peut pas \u00eatre tenue responsable de ce qu'a v\u00e9cu Mme Schuyler lorsqu'elle se pr\u00e9parait pour l'audience. L'intim\u00e9e avait le droit de se d\u00e9fendre et Mme Schuyler a reconnu qu'elle l'a fait dans des circonstances difficiles sans porter davantage atteinte \u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9.\nc) Conclusion [157] Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances un montant de 4 000 $ est adjug\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Schuyler pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Ce montant a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit afin de tenir compte de la part de responsabilit\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9e par sa conduite.\n(iii) Conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e [158] Mme Schuyler a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 qu'on lui accorde des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, lequel permet au Tribunal d'ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Mme Schuyler demande qu'on lui accorde l'indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $.\n[159] La discrimination qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce est regrettable. Elle n'est toutefois pas de l'importance de ce que l'on voit r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement dans de nombreuses instances. La bande a \u00e0 tout le moins fait ce qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi. Il me semble \u00e9galement que la demande d'indemnisation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) d\u00e9coule principalement de l'all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\n[160] La pr\u00e9sente instance \u00e9tait une affaire relative \u00e0 l'emploi qui a engendr\u00e9 d'autres affaires. Les hostilit\u00e9s entre les parties avaient un c\u00f4t\u00e9 extravagant, mais je suis convaincu que les comportements inacceptables peuvent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9s au diff\u00e9rend non r\u00e9gl\u00e9 relatif \u00e0 l'emploi. Ce n'est pas sur quoi porte la Loi. Le paragraphe 53(3) vise une situation dans laquelle la conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e s'inscrit dans un contexte de discrimination plut\u00f4t que dans le contexte d'un diff\u00e9rend indirect.\n(iv) L'affichage de la d\u00e9cision [161] Mme Schuyler a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que ma d\u00e9cision soit affich\u00e9e dans un endroit bien en vue. L'intim\u00e9e affirme que le Tribunal n'a pas le pouvoir d'ordonner cet affichage.\n[162] M. Peters pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne tire son origine de la loi. Le seul pouvoir dont il jouit \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard doit donc \u00eatre pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La seule disposition pertinente semble \u00eatre l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a), lequel mentionne que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire :\n[...] de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables [...]\nM. Peters affirme que rien dans cette disposition n'accorde au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ordonner qu'une d\u00e9cision soit affich\u00e9e dans un endroit bien en vue.\n[163] Le pouvoir d'ordonner que l'intim\u00e9e affiche la d\u00e9cision doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9vu, s'il est pr\u00e9vu quelque part, dans la premi\u00e8re partie de cette disposition, laquelle mentionne que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte. La question de l'interpr\u00e9tation des lois se r\u00e9sume donc \u00e0 la question de savoir si une directive qu'une d\u00e9cision soit affich\u00e9e s'inscrit dans le cadre d'une ordonnance de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire.\n[164] Je crois qu'il faut r\u00e9pondre par l'affirmative. La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est de nature r\u00e9paratrice. Elle traite de question d'importance fondamentale et devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e d'une fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale. On affirme g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que l'objet des mesures r\u00e9paratrices pr\u00e9vues dans la Loi est de remettre la personne l\u00e9s\u00e9e dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si le tort n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. Je crois que cela s'applique, au m\u00eame titre que toute autre chose, autant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat \u00e9motif qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9tat psychologique de la victime. L'affichage de la d\u00e9cision contribuera \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer en partie l'isolation et l'exclusion dont Mme Schuyler a fait l'objet en cons\u00e9quence de la discrimination.\n[165] Il y a un autre aspect \u00e0 cela : la preuve dont je suis saisi indique clairement que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Schuyler et le cong\u00e9diement ult\u00e9rieur dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet \u00e9taient d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public pour la bande. Je crois que Mme Schuyler a parfaitement le droit de se pr\u00e9occuper de sa r\u00e9putation et de vouloir r\u00e9tablir les faits. La d\u00e9cision ne lui est pas enti\u00e8rement favorable, mais une ordonnance d'afficher la d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 tout le moins, mettra \u00e0 la disposition de tous un compte rendu impartial du litige qui l'a oppos\u00e9e avec la bande.\n[166] Puis, il y a le fait que l'affichage de la d\u00e9cision vise une fin \u00e9ducative. Ma conclusion est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par l'arr\u00eat Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, dans lequel le juge La Forest a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne comporte des fins \u00e9ducatives. Je souligne qu'il d\u00e9clare ensuite, au paragraphe 15, que l'un des objectifs vis\u00e9s par la Loi est d'informer les gens dans des milieux de travail pr\u00e9cis :\nQui plus est, selon l'interpr\u00e9tation que je viens de proposer, l'\u00e9ducation des gens doit commencer \u00e0 se faire sur les lieux de travail, dans cette micro d\u00e9mocratie que constitue le milieu de travail, plut\u00f4t que dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\nCela est vrai, en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 la fois en rapport avec l'administration de la bande et \u00e0 la fois en rapport avec le processus d\u00e9mocratique \u00e9largie de la r\u00e9serve.\n[167] Il y a \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat CN c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, souvent appel\u00e9 l'arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes. Dans cet arr\u00eat, le juge en chef Dickson a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la page 1134 que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 :\n[...] reconna\u00eetre et [\u00e0] donner effet pleinement aux droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. On ne devrait pas chercher par toutes sortes de fa\u00e7ons \u00e0 les minimiser ou \u00e0 diminuer leur effet.\nJe crois que les arr\u00eats Robichaud et Action Travail des Femmes peuvent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s ensemble dans le contexte imm\u00e9diat.\n[168] Il y a lieu de souligner que dans l'arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes, on parle de l'effet des droits consacr\u00e9s par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Je crois que le mot effet comprend l'impact social d'une d\u00e9cision. Les plaintes dont il est question en l'esp\u00e8ce ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engendr\u00e9es dans une collectivit\u00e9 pr\u00e9cise qui a un int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif dans la d\u00e9cision et qui a besoin d'\u00eatre inform\u00e9e sur la situation. Il n'y a rien d'unilat\u00e9ral dans ceci : les deux parties ont eu en partie gain de cause dans le litige et je ne vois pas ce que l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e0 craindre d'une telle directive.\n[169] J'ai trouv\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision qui semble donner une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente. Dans la d\u00e9cision Chopra c. Sant\u00e9 Canada 2004 TCDP 27 (d\u00e9cision qui a fait l'objet d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la part de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et qui fait pr\u00e9sentement l'objet d'un appel pour d'autres motifs), au paragraphe 62, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 une demande d'ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'afficher sa d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle du pays, par voie de courrier \u00e9lectronique, \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s du minist\u00e8re. Je crois toutefois que la situation qui m'est soumise est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente. Mme Schuyler ne demande pas que l'on fasse un envoi massif de courriel \u00e0 une foule d'\u00e9trangers vivant un peu partout au pays.\n[170] En m\u00eame temps, je ne crois pas qu'il serait utile d'afficher la d\u00e9cision dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. J'ordonne donc \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'afficher un avis informant les membres de la bande qu'une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par le Tribunal. Cet avis devra \u00eatre \u00e9crit en caract\u00e8res suffisamment gros et devra \u00eatre affich\u00e9 sur le tableau d'affichage principal de l'immeuble de l'administration ou dans un endroit aussi en vue. L'avis doit mentionner que l'on peut se procurer des copies de la d\u00e9cision au comptoir de la r\u00e9ception ou \u00e0 un autre endroit appropri\u00e9. Les copies doivent \u00eatre offertes gratuitement.\n(v) L'examen des politiques [171] Mme Schuyler d\u00e9sire \u00e9galement que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne fasse un examen des politiques de la bande et n\u00e9gocie un protocole d'entente avec celle-ci afin d'\u00e9tablir un processus visant \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les questions de droits de la personne. Elle veut qu'un d\u00e9fenseur des droits de la personne soit nomm\u00e9 et qu'un processus d'appel ind\u00e9pendant soit instaur\u00e9.\n[172] Je souligne que la pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish s'est pench\u00e9e sur une situation semblable dans Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel du Canada T.D. 1\/01 2001\/02\/05, aux paragraphes 274 et 275, o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[274] Mme Nkwazi demande que le Tribunal ordonne au SCC de prendre, de concert avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 emp\u00eacher que de tels actes discriminatoires se reproduisent \u00e0 l'avenir. Bien que le SCC ait mis en place des politiques et m\u00e9thodes visant \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la discrimination et le harc\u00e8lement au travail, il est \u00e9vident, si l'on en juge par la fa\u00e7on dont la direction du CPR a r\u00e9agi aux r\u00e9criminations de Mme Nkwazi, qu'il y a place \u00e0 am\u00e9lioration. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne que le SCC consulte la Commission au sujet de ses politiques et m\u00e9thodes de lutte contre la discrimination et le harc\u00e8lement et de ses programmes d'\u00e9ducation des employ\u00e9s dans ces domaines, et qu'il prenne des mesures pour emp\u00eacher que des actes identiques ou similaires se reproduisent \u00e0 l'avenir.\n[173] La situation dont je suis saisi est tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente car la preuve donne \u00e0 penser que la discrimination exerc\u00e9e contre Mme Schuyler r\u00e9sultait d'une situation pr\u00e9cise se rapportant \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re. Il n'y a pas vraiment de preuve de discrimination syst\u00e9mique ou d'enjeux plus vastes.\n[174] Comme le souligne Mme Mactavish, il y a \u00e9galement le probl\u00e8me que le Tribunal ne semble pas avoir le pouvoir d'ordonner \u00e0 la Commission de participer \u00e0 un tel processus. Il existe un m\u00e9canisme dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne dont l'intim\u00e9 peut se pr\u00e9valoir s'il d\u00e9sire consulter la CCDP. Il serait certainement louable si l'intim\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce s'en pr\u00e9valait. Je ne suis toutefois pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder la d\u00e9livrance du type d'ordonnance demand\u00e9e par Mme Schuyler.\n(vi) Les frais et les d\u00e9bours [175] Mme Schuyler a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens. Cette demande est compliqu\u00e9e par deux faits. Le premier fait est que Mme Schuyler a retenu les services d'un avocat afin de s'occuper des aspects de l'affaire relatifs \u00e0 l'emploi, lesquels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on distincte. Elle a r\u00e9duit sa demande afin de tenir compte de cela. Le deuxi\u00e8me fait, toutefois, est qu'elle r\u00e9clame des frais pour des services qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus devant la Commission. Je ne crois pas qu'elle ait droit \u00e0 ces frais.\n[176] Dans la d\u00e9cision Brooks c. Minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans, 2005 TCDP 26 (2005\/07\/12), au paragraphe 39, j'ai conclu que la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re d'adjudication de d\u00e9pens devrait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e au frais qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9s pour la poursuite de l'affaire devant le Tribunal. Cette d\u00e9cision a fait l'objet d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire sans que cette question pr\u00e9cise ne soit trait\u00e9e. J'ai \u00e9galement discut\u00e9 de la jurisprudence dans Brown c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 30 (2004\/09\/01). Je ne vois rien dans les circonstances qui me sont soumises qui justifierait que l'on revienne sur la question. Dans les circonstances, point n'est besoin de traiter de la question plus fondamentale de savoir si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des d\u00e9pens, question qui sera semble-t-il soumise \u00e0 la Cour d'appel.\n[177] Il y a toujours la question des frais que Mme Schuyler a encourus en consultant un avocat lorsqu'elle demandait que l'on prenne des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Cette question est vis\u00e9e par une exception reconnue dans le droit relatif aux d\u00e9pens et peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de frais pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(1)d) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Mme Schuyler a \u00e9galement droit aux d\u00e9bours encourus quant aux frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte comme les frais de transport, les frais de photocopie, etc. Plut\u00f4t que d'ouvrir la porte \u00e0 un autre diff\u00e9rend entre les parties, je crois qu'il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'accorder un montant forfaitaire de 600 $, lequel, selon moi, constitue un montant raisonnable \u00e0 accorder quant \u00e0 ces diverses d\u00e9penses.\n(vii) Les questions laiss\u00e9es en suspens [178] C'est aux parties qu'il revient de d\u00e9cider si elles d\u00e9sirent soumettre une ordonnance \u00e9crite. Si tel est le cas, je suis d'avis qu'il serait plus pratique pour l'intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9diger l'ordonnance car Mme Schuyler n'est pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat. Il serait bon qu'elle examine l'\u00e9bauche d'ordonnance en compagnie d'un avocat qu'elle aura choisi.\n[179] Les montants d'indemnit\u00e9s et de d\u00e9bours que j'ai accord\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre vers\u00e9s dans les trente jours de l'expiration de toute p\u00e9riode de contr\u00f4le judiciaire ou d'appel. Je r\u00e9serve ma comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9gler toutes questions laiss\u00e9es en suspens.\nM.

J'ai conclu que l'APAC devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Elle est une signataire de la convention collective avec Air Canada, laquelle contient des dispositions se rapportant \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire des pilotes d'Air Canada. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle a un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9vident quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[7] J'ai de plus conclu que le groupe Fly Past 60 Coalition devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je renvoie et je souscris au raisonnement de l'avocat de la Commission contenu dans sa lettre du 12 juillet 2006 qui \u00e9nonce les motifs pour lesquels la Commission appuie la demande de la Coalition.\n[8] L'APAC et le groupe Fly Past 60 Coalition seront autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 participer pleinement \u00e0 l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte devant le Tribunal, notamment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de preuve et au contre-interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins, dans la mesure o\u00f9 une telle participation ne fait pas double emploi avec la preuve et les observations de la Commission, du plaignant ou d'Air Canada.\n[9] L'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier de divulgation pour le plaignant, la Commission et Air Canada demeurera le m\u00eame.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Lors d'une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de cas qui a eu lieu le 21 juin 2006, le Comit\u00e9 des griefs des Forces canadiennes (le Comit\u00e9) a exprim\u00e9 des r\u00e9serves quant au caract\u00e8re suffisant du r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de Me Micheline Montreuil concernant le t\u00e9moignage que pr\u00e9voit donner son t\u00e9moin, Pierre Lacasse. Par cons\u00e9quent, Me Montreuil a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 qu'elle a remis au Comit\u00e9 peu de temps apr\u00e8s. Le 11 juillet 2006, le Comit\u00e9 a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que, selon lui, le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de M. Lacasse ne comprenait toujours pas assez de d\u00e9tails.\n[2] Dans ce r\u00e9sum\u00e9 modifi\u00e9, lequel comprend environ 20 lignes, Me Montreuil explique que M. Lacasse t\u00e9moignera qu'il est un militaire \u00e0 la retraite et qu'il a travaill\u00e9 pour le Comit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre contractuel jusqu'en novembre 2003. Il t\u00e9moignera qu'il a entendu deux gestionnaires du Comit\u00e9 (dont les noms figurent dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9) faire des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes \u00e0 propos de Me Montreuil, lesquelles remarques comprenaient des propos selon lesquelles elle ne serait pas embauch\u00e9e parce qu'elle est transgenre et qu'il serait difficile d'imaginer qu'une transgenre travaille comme agente des griefs. Selon le r\u00e9sum\u00e9, M. Lacasse t\u00e9moignera \u00e9galement qu'il n'a jamais rencontr\u00e9 Me Montreuil et qu'il n'a aucun lien de parent\u00e9 avec elle. Il t\u00e9moignera \u00e9galement que c'est lui qui a communiqu\u00e9 avec Me Montreuil pour l'informer quant \u00e0 la conversation qu'il avait entendue.\n[3] Le Comit\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 n'est pas complet parce que les d\u00e9tails suivants n'y figurent pas :\nDans quel contexte la conversation a-t-elle eu lieu?\nQuelles \u00e9taient les personnes pr\u00e9sentes et quelles sont celles qui ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la conversation?\n\u00c0 quelle personne les remarques ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 faites?\n\u00c0 combien de reprises les remarques ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et \u00e0 quelle(s) date(s)?\n\u00c0 quel endroit les remarques ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 faites?\nO\u00f9 M. Lacasse se trouvait-il lorsqu'il a entendu les remarques?\n[4] Le Comit\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend qu'il sera incapable de pr\u00e9parer sa d\u00e9fense tant qu'il n'aura pas obtenu de r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 ces questions.\n[5] Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu fait partie de l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions que chacune des parties doit pr\u00e9parer et d\u00e9poser en conformit\u00e9 avec le paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Hormis le r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions doit comprendre une liste des documents qui seront divulgu\u00e9s et doit \u00e9num\u00e9rer les faits pertinents que la partie cherche \u00e0 prouver \u00e0 l'appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions, ainsi que sa position sur les questions juridiques soulev\u00e9es et sur le redressement qu'elle demande, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[6] Comme le Tribunal l'a soulign\u00e9 dans Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Territoires du Nord-Ouest (Ministre du Personnel), [2000] D.C.D.P. no 9 (T.C.D.P.)(QL), paragraphe 7, une partie n'a droit qu'aux faits essentiels que la partie adverse invoque en plaidant sa cause. La partie qui d\u00e9pose l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions n'a pas \u00e0 plaider sa preuve \u00e0 ce stade-ci. Selon moi, ce principe devrait logiquement s'appliquer aux r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages qui font partie de l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Comme le Tribunal l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, l'objet vis\u00e9 par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions est de pr\u00e9ciser les points \u00e0 d\u00e9battre en l'esp\u00e8ce et de d\u00e9montrer le bien-fond\u00e9 des arguments auxquels les autres parties devront r\u00e9pondre en pr\u00e9sentant leur propre preuve.\n[7] En l'esp\u00e8ce, les pr\u00e9cisions fournies dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 de Me Montreuil suffisent tout \u00e0 fait \u00e0 informer le Comit\u00e9 des arguments qu'il doit r\u00e9futer. Le Comit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que M. Lacasse t\u00e9moignera qu'il a entendu les deux gestionnaires vis\u00e9s parler de Me Montreuil en termes d\u00e9sobligeants et mentionner qu'elle ne serait pas embaucher parce qu'elle \u00e9tait transgenre.\n[8] Il appert des observations \u00e9crites du Comit\u00e9 figurant dans sa requ\u00eate que ses r\u00e9serves concernant le caract\u00e8re suffisant du r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de Me Montreuil tirent leur origine du fait que les deux cadres vis\u00e9s qui auraient tenu la conversation affirment ne pas se souvenir de cette discussion.\n[9] Je ne vois pas en quoi cela a une incidence sur l'affaire dont je suis saisi. Il n'est pas rare que deux parties adverses donnent des versions contradictoires quant \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e8nements. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la raison pour laquelle on tient des audiences et pourquoi des tribunaux sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 rendre des d\u00e9cisions apr\u00e8s avoir entendu l'ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Il est important de ne pas perdre de vue que c'est \u00e0 Me Montreuil qu'incombe le fardeau ultime de prouver ses pr\u00e9tentions au moyen d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui peuvent comprendre le t\u00e9moignage de M. Lacasse concernant la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conversation. Si le Comit\u00e9, s'appuyant sur la parole de ses employ\u00e9s, estime qu'il a des motifs de mettre en doute l'exactitude et la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de M. Lacasse, il peut examiner ces questions en le contre-interrogeant.\n[10] Je ne vois donc aucun motif pour lequel j'ordonnerais \u00e0 Me Montreuil de fournir des d\u00e9tails suppl\u00e9mentaires concernant le t\u00e9moignage que se propose de donner M. Lacasse. La requ\u00eate du Comit\u00e9 est rejet\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

Introduction [1] Madame Dannie Bertnatchez (ci-apr\u00e8s : la plaignante) a enseign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole Olamen situ\u00e9e \u00e0 La Romaine sur la Basse-C\u00f4te-Nord. L'\u00c9cole Olamen rel\u00e8ve du Conseil des Montagnais de Unamen Shipu (ci-apr\u00e8s : l'intim\u00e9). Du 25 ao\u00fbt 2003 au 27 d\u00e9cembre 2003 (une p\u00e9riode de 18 semaines), la plaignante \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 suivi d'un cong\u00e9 parental jusqu'au 21 juin 2004. Lors de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, la plaignante a re\u00e7u de l'intim\u00e9 des prestations suppl\u00e9mentaires de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 (ci-apr\u00e8s : les PSCM).\n[2] La plaignante soumet que l'intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en refusant que le calcul de son salaire annuel pour les fins des PSCM se fasse sur la base d'une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration journali\u00e8re \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 1\/200 de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle. Or, l'intim\u00e9 a fait le calcul en employant une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration journali\u00e8re \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 1\/260 de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle. De plus, la plaignante conteste le refus de l'intim\u00e9 de lui verser un montant \u00e9quivalent aux journ\u00e9es de maladie accumul\u00e9es et non utilis\u00e9es pendant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Elle soutient que ces refus contreviennent \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne 1 (ci-apr\u00e8s : la Loi) parce qu'ils ont pour effet de la d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite, \u00e0 savoir le sexe.\n[3] \u00c0 l'audience, la plaignante \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par avocat ainsi que l'intim\u00e9. La Commission n'a pas comparu. Trois t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus. Pour la plaignante : elle-m\u00eame et une autre enseignante, madame Marie-Jos\u00e9e Chamberland. L'intim\u00e9 a fait entendre monsieur R\u00e9jean Laberge, Directeur des services \u00e9ducatifs \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9.\nII. Les faits [4] La plaignante est \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9 depuis septembre 1998. Elle enseigne aux \u00e9tudiants de niveau secondaire. Depuis ao\u00fbt 1999, la plaignante est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une enseignante \u00e0 temps plein r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. La plaignante explique qu'\u00e0 titre d'enseignante \u00e0 temps plein r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, elle est r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e pour 200 jours de travail correspondant \u00e0 40 semaines. Comme les enseignants r\u00e9guliers ne sont pas \u00e9ligibles \u00e0 l'assurance-emploi pendant la p\u00e9riode estivale, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu avec l'intim\u00e9 d'\u00e9taler sur 26 paies (260 jours) le salaire annuel des enseignants r\u00e9guliers et ce, afin de leur permettre de recevoir un salaire pendant la p\u00e9riode estivale.\n[5] Pour l'ann\u00e9e scolaire 2003-2004, la plaignante a d\u00e9but\u00e9 son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 le 25 ao\u00fbt 2003 suivi d'un cong\u00e9 parental du 29 d\u00e9cembre 2003 au 21 juin 2004. Lors de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 (18 semaines), la plaignante a re\u00e7u de l'intim\u00e9 des PSCM \u00e9quivalentes \u00e0 93% de son salaire annuel bas\u00e9es sur 26 paies moins les prestations de maternit\u00e9 vers\u00e9es par l'assurance-emploi. \u00c0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 parental, la plaignante est retourn\u00e9e au travail les 22 et 23 juin 2004. Pour chacune de ces deux journ\u00e9es, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 sur une base de 1\/200 de son salaire annuel plut\u00f4t que sur 1\/260. La plaignante n'a pas re\u00e7u de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de l'intim\u00e9 pendant l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2004.\n[6] La plaignante explique que la seule politique de l'intim\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 sa connaissance durant toute la dur\u00e9e de son emploi est la Politique du personnel de l'\u00e9cole Olamen de la Romaine-mai 2001 (ci-apr\u00e8s : La politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001).\n[7] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante relate ses rencontres et entretiens t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques durant l'ann\u00e9e 2003-2004 avec le Directeur des services \u00e9ducatifs de l'intim\u00e9, monsieur R\u00e9jean Laberge. Ce dernier repr\u00e9sente l'intim\u00e9 en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'application des politiques portant sur les conditions d'emploi. Dans un premier temps, elle a d\u00fb clarifier avec monsieur Laberge le salaire annuel de base servant de calcul pour les PSCM. Monsieur Laberge a reconnu que ce salaire \u00e9tait de 57 960$ plut\u00f4t que 57 860$. Deuxi\u00e8mement, la plaignante a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 que les PSCM lui soient vers\u00e9es pendant le d\u00e9lai de carence impos\u00e9 par l'assurance-emploi \u00e0 savoir les semaines 1 et 2 ainsi que la derni\u00e8re semaine de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9 a fait droit \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante. Cette derni\u00e8re a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 monsieur Laberge que l'intim\u00e9 lui octroie les PSCM sur un salaire annuel bas\u00e9 sur une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration journali\u00e8re calcul\u00e9e sur 200 jours plut\u00f4t que sur 260 jours. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, monsieur Laberge aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il acceptait sa demande. Cependant, un mois plus tard, la plaignante recevait une lettre de monsieur Laberge refusant sa demande. Dans cette lettre, monsieur Laberge pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 la plaignante qu'il refuse de lui payer l'\u00e9quivalent des journ\u00e9es de maladie accumul\u00e9es pendant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\n[8] Le deuxi\u00e8me t\u00e9moin entendu pour la plaignante fut madame Marie-Jos\u00e9e Chamberland, enseignante r\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00e0 temps plein depuis septembre 2000 aupr\u00e8s de l'intim\u00e9. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle d\u00e9clare que la seule politique de l'intim\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 sa connaissance fut la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001. Elle t\u00e9moigne qu'en ao\u00fbt 2004, monsieur Laberge a inform\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s que l'intim\u00e9 avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne plus offrir les PSCM pour l'ann\u00e9e 2004-2005. \u00c0 cette occasion, il a remis \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s un exemplaire de la nouvelle politique de l'intim\u00e9. Cette politique n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve.\n[9] Pour l'intim\u00e9, le seul t\u00e9moin entendu fut monsieur R\u00e9jean Laberge. Ce dernier est \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9 depuis janvier 2001. Entre janvier 2001 et septembre 2003, il exerce la fonction de Directeur de l'\u00e9cole. En septembre 2003, il cumule la fonction de Directeur de l'\u00e9cole et celle de Directeur des services \u00e9ducatifs. \u00c0 compter de janvier 2004, les fonctions de monsieur Laberge seront exclusivement celles de Directeur des services \u00e9ducatifs. \u00c0 ce titre, monsieur Laberge est responsable de l'application des politiques portant sur les conditions d'emploi.\n[10] Monsieur Laberge explique que le document de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence concernant les conditions de travail de tous les employ\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9 est la Politique du personnel Conseil des Innu d'Unamen-Shipu de novembre 2001 (ci-apr\u00e8s : La politique du Conseil-novembre 2001). \u00c0 son entr\u00e9e en fonction en septembre 2003 \u00e0 titre de Directeur des services \u00e9ducatifs, la Directrice adjointe des services \u00e9ducatifs de son pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur lui a remis la Politique du personnel de l'\u00c9cole Olamen-mars 2003 (ci-apr\u00e8s : La politique de l'\u00e9cole-mars 2003). Le t\u00e9moin relate qu'ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la politique de mars 2003, existait une autre politique intitul\u00e9e Politique de l'\u00e9cole Olamen-mai 2002 (ci-apr\u00e8s : La politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2002). Du t\u00e9moignage de monsieur Laberge, il ressort qu'il existe une politique de l'\u00e9cole et une politique du Conseil, laquelle s'applique \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9. La politique de l'\u00e9cole qu'il a appliqu\u00e9e au dossier de la plaignante est celle de mars 2003.\n[11] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, monsieur Laberge a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'avant le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 de la plaignante, deux autres enseignantes ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 des PSCM et il a appliqu\u00e9 le m\u00eame calcul, c'est-\u00e0-dire 93% de leur salaire annuel sur 260 jours.\n[12] Relativement aux cong\u00e9s de maladie, monsieur Laberge explique son refus comme suit:\nQ. [Me Jos\u00e9 Rondeau] : Alors, au m\u00eame titre, la r\u00e9clamation pour des journ\u00e9es de maladie, vous lui refusez pour quelle raison ?\nIl ne peut y avoir de cong\u00e9s de maladie monnayables, tu ne peux pas avoir accumul\u00e9 des cong\u00e9s de maladie si tu n'as pas travaill\u00e9. Quelqu'un qui est en cong\u00e9 sans solde, il n'accumule pas de cong\u00e9s de maladie.\nIII. Cadre juridique [13] La Loi \u00e9nonce \u00e0 son article 3 le sexe comme motif de distinction illicite en pr\u00e9cisant qu'une distinction fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse ou l'accouchement est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a reconnu une situation de discrimination en cours d'emploi fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse dans l'arr\u00eat Brooks c. Canada Safeway Ltd.2 Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour a conclu qu'il \u00e9tait discriminatoire que le r\u00e9gime d'assurance-salaire en vigueur chez l'employeur prive les salari\u00e9es enceintes de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 pendant dix-sept semaines commen\u00e7ant la dixi\u00e8me semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent la semaine pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de l'accouchement et finissant la sixi\u00e8me semaine apr\u00e8s celle de l'accouchement.\n[14] Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient le seul motif des actes reproch\u00e9s pour que la plainte soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont motiv\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9.3\n[15] Il incombe \u00e0 la personne qui all\u00e8gue \u00eatre victime de discrimination en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d'en faire la preuve devant le tribunal. Selon l'arr\u00eat Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Etobicoke (Municipalit\u00e9), un plaignant doit prouver qu'il est, de prime abord, victime de discrimination.4 Autrement dit, un plaignant doit faire une preuve prima facie de discrimination. L'arr\u00eat O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd., pr\u00e9cise que cette preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur.5\n[16] Dans l'affaire Canada (Ministre de la D\u00e9fense nationale) c. Mongrain 6 , la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne suffit pas pour le plaignant d'affirmer qu'il a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'il est victime de discrimination pour d\u00e9placer le fardeau de preuve vers l'intim\u00e9. Il doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie.\n[17] Une fois que la preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une justification raisonnable d\u00e9montrant que la d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en rapport avec le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite de discrimination. La justification invoqu\u00e9e ne doit pas \u00eatre un simple pr\u00e9texte.7\nIV. Analyse [18] Le Tribunal est saisi de deux questions. La premi\u00e8re concerne l'all\u00e9gation de la plaignante selon laquelle l'intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, en refusant d'\u00e9tablir le calcul des PSCM sur la base de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle divis\u00e9e par 200 jours de travail. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la plaignante r\u00e9clame \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9: 93% de la diff\u00e9rence entre mon salaire annuel divis\u00e9 par 20 p\u00e9riodes de paie (200 jours de travail) et celui divis\u00e9 par 26 p\u00e9riodes de paie (260 jours) et ce, pour 18 semaines.\n[19] La deuxi\u00e8me question a trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de la plaignante selon laquelle l'intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, en refusant de lui attribuer un montant \u00e9quivalent aux journ\u00e9es de maladie monnayables accumul\u00e9es pendant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Selon la plaignante, elle aurait accumul\u00e9 pendant la dur\u00e9e de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, 3,15 jours de cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n[20] Dans un premier temps, le Tribunal proc\u00e9dera \u00e0 l'analyse de la question portant sur le calcul des PSCM. Par la suite, le Tribunal examinera la question des cong\u00e9s de maladie.\nA. Le calcul des PSCM [21] Il ressort de la preuve que les PSCM sont octroy\u00e9es aux employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res qui sont \u00e9ligibles \u00e0 l'assurance-emploi. Le but des PSCM, tel qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 aux politiques de l'\u00e9cole vise \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter les prestations d'assurance-emploi lors de l'arr\u00eat de travail temporaire caus\u00e9 par une grossesse seulement. Toutes les politiques de l'\u00e9cole pr\u00e9voient que le r\u00e9gime des PSCM s'applique aux employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res qui deviennent enceintes. Enfin, toutes ces politiques pr\u00e9cisent ce qui suit :\n\u00ab La somme des prestations hebdomadaires payables en vertu du r\u00e9gime et des prestations hebdomadaires brutes d'assurance-emploi correspond \u00e0 93% de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration habituelle de la salari\u00e9e. \u00bb\n[22] Pour la plaignante, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration habituelle d'une employ\u00e9e r\u00e9guli\u00e8re correspond \u00e0 une prestation de travail de 200 jours dont la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est \u00e9tal\u00e9e sur une p\u00e9riode de 26 p\u00e9riodes de paie. Toujours selon la plaignante, dans le cas d'une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration n'est pas \u00e9tal\u00e9e sur une p\u00e9riode de 26 paies. Ce ne sont que les employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res, qui pour s'assurer une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration durant tout l'\u00e9t\u00e9, acceptent un \u00e9talement de leur r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration sur une p\u00e9riode de 26 p\u00e9riodes de paie.\n[23] D'entr\u00e9e de jeu, le Tribunal constate que toutes les modalit\u00e9s du calcul des PSCM ne sont pas explicitement pr\u00e9vues aux politiques de l'\u00e9cole. Hormis le fait que toutes ces politiques pr\u00e9voient que le calcul des PSCM correspond \u00e0 93% de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration habituelle de la salari\u00e9e, il n'est pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 si ce calcul doit \u00eatre divis\u00e9 par 20 ou 26 semaines. Cependant, toutes les politiques de l'\u00e9cole pr\u00e9voient que le calcul 1\/200 jours est utilis\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer le salaire des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel (politique de l'\u00e9cole mai-2001) ou pour d\u00e9terminer le salaire des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel ou \u00e0 contrat (politique de l'\u00e9cole mai 2002 et mars 2003). Toutes les politiques de l'\u00e9cole reconnaissent un caract\u00e8re suppl\u00e9tif \u00e0 la politique du Conseil. En effet, ces politiques \u00e9noncent :\nDans le cas de vides organisationnels du pr\u00e9sent document, la Politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Conseil de Bande fait force de loi.\n[24] Or, la politique du Conseil-novembre 2001 pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit pour les employ\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers et occasionnels :\nLa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de l'employ\u00e9 est \u00e9tablie selon une base annuelle ramen\u00e9e sur une base de deux (2) semaines (ou soixante-dix (70) heures pour les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein), en divisant le traitement pr\u00e9vu par un facteur de conversion de vingt-six (26).\n[25] Le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9, monsieur Laberge a \u00e9crit (Pi\u00e8ce P-8) que l'octroi des PSCM \u00e9tait discr\u00e9tionnaire. Il a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 ce point lors de son t\u00e9moignage. De l'avis du Tribunal, cette affirmation n'a pas d'incidence sur la pr\u00e9sente affaire puisque l'intim\u00e9 a accept\u00e9 de verser les PSCM \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[26] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9 a toujours consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les PSCM comme un avantage reconnu aux employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res enceintes et que l'indemnit\u00e9 vers\u00e9e lui semblait \u00e9quitable. Le Tribunal tient \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser qu'il ne lui appartient pas de d\u00e9terminer si la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9 de calculer les PSCM en divisant par 26 semaines est \u00e9quitable. Le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu discrimination. Pour r\u00e9pondre affirmativement \u00e0 cette question, la plaignante doit \u00e9tablir par une preuve prima facie, qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi pour un motif de distinction illicite, \u00e0 savoir sa grossesse.\n[27] En l'esp\u00e8ce, pour d\u00e9terminer si la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e pour un motif illicite, il faut une analyse comparative afin de d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e8gle touche une personne ou un groupe de personnes d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente par rapport \u00e0 d'autres personnes auxquelles elle peut s'appliquer.8\n[28] Ainsi, le Tribunal doit identifier le groupe qui est \u00e9galement vis\u00e9 par la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle. La plaignante soutient qu'\u00e0 titre de salari\u00e9e r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, sa situation doit \u00eatre compar\u00e9e au groupe auquel elle appartient, c'est-\u00e0-dire les employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Autrement dit selon la plaignante, il faut se poser la question suivante : est-ce que l'intim\u00e9, par son mode de calcul des PSCM, traite diff\u00e9remment la plaignante des employ\u00e9es salari\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res qui ne sont pas enceintes ? Pour la plaignante, l'expression r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration habituelle utilis\u00e9e pour calculer les PSCM doit se comparer \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration habituelle reconnue et vers\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res qui ne sont pas enceintes et qui re\u00e7oivent une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[29] Pour sa part, l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que la situation de la plaignante doit se comparer \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui n'a pas travaill\u00e9. Or, un employ\u00e9 n'a droit au r\u00e9siduel (montant pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 en trop en raison de l'\u00e9talement sur 26 semaines), que s'il a travaill\u00e9 et uniquement pour la proportion du temps travaill\u00e9. Pour l'intim\u00e9, la situation de la plaignante doit \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 une employ\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 sans solde.\n[30] Dans l'arr\u00eat Brooks, le groupe auquel s'identifiaient les plaignantes \u00e9tait tous les employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective de l'employeur. Tel que d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, ce r\u00e9gime comportait une couverture s\u00e9lective en excluant les travailleuses enceintes des prestations hebdomadaires en cas de perte de salaire pour cause de maladie et d'accident pour une p\u00e9riode de dix-sept semaines. Pendant ces dix-sept semaines, les femmes enceintes ne pouvaient toucher aucune prestation m\u00eame si elles souffraient d'une maladie tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 leur grossesse. Le r\u00e9gime avait donc pour effet de traiter diff\u00e9remment la grossesse des autres incapacit\u00e9s de travailler li\u00e9es \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. La Cour \u00e9crit :\nLes avantages sociaux sont de plus en plus souvent int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans les conditions de travail. D\u00e8s qu'un employeur d\u00e9cide de fournir un r\u00e9gime d'avantages sociaux, il ne peut faire d'exclusions de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire. Une indemnit\u00e9 s\u00e9lective de cette nature reviendrait clairement \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Les avantages fournis dans le cadre de l'emploi doivent \u00eatre fournis sans discrimination.9\n[31] En l'esp\u00e8ce, les PSCM sont un avantage qui s'adresse exclusivement aux employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res enceintes. Les employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res non enceintes ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par la r\u00e8gle des PSCM. Dans l'arr\u00eat Brooks, la r\u00e8gle d'exclusion des femmes enceintes \u00e9tait contenue dans un r\u00e9gime d'assurance sant\u00e9 qui s'appliquait \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s. Les faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire sont diff\u00e9rents.\n[32] De l'avis du Tribunal, au-del\u00e0 de l'interpr\u00e9tation que l'on peut donner \u00e0 l'expression r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration habituelle, il faut avant tout d\u00e9terminer si la plaignante, lorsqu'elle re\u00e7oit les PSCM, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une employ\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 avec ou sans solde. Ce n'est qu'une fois ce point \u00e9tabli, que le Tribunal pourra d\u00e9terminer si la plaignante a raison d'invoquer comme groupe comparatif celui des employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res non enceintes qui re\u00e7oivent une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[33] Or, \u00e0 la lecture de toutes les politiques de l'\u00e9cole d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve, on constate que les PSCM sont qualifi\u00e9es de prestations et non pas de salaire ou de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Certes, les prestations sont calcul\u00e9es sur la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration habituelle mais cela ne signifie pas qu'elles constituent de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ou qu'elles doivent \u00eatre assimil\u00e9es \u00e0 du salaire ou de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. De l'avis du Tribunal, les PSCM visent \u00e0 compenser une absence de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, mais cela ne permet pas d'assimiler les PSCM \u00e0 une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[34] Au surplus, toutes les politiques de l'\u00e9cole utilisent \u00e9galement le terme allocation de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 pour qualifier les PSCM. Encore une fois, le mot r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ou salaire n'est pas utilis\u00e9.\n[35] Dans l'affaire Dumont-Ferlatte 10, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a rejet\u00e9 la r\u00e9clamation d'employ\u00e9es de la Fonction publique du Canada all\u00e9guant une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe au motif qu'on a refus\u00e9 de leur cr\u00e9diter des cong\u00e9s annuels, des cong\u00e9s de maladie et de leur payer des primes mensuelles au bilinguisme durant leur cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Dans cette affaire, les plaignantes all\u00e9guaient que les PSCM re\u00e7ues constituaient de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon les plaignantes, aux fins d'\u00e9tablir le groupe comparatif appropri\u00e9, elles devaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 avec traitement. Le Tribunal a conclu que les PSCM ne constituaient pas une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et que l'existence ou non de discrimination devait s'analyser en comparant les cons\u00e9quences rattach\u00e9es aux diff\u00e9rentes formes de cong\u00e9s sans solde. Le Tribunal \u00e9crit :\nDe par l'essence m\u00eame du contrat de travail, le revenu ou la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est directement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la prestation de travail. Or, pendant la prise de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, la femme enceinte ne fournit pas de prestation de travail et elle ne saurait \u00eatre r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e.11\n(...)\nComme la femme enceinte n'est pas en mesure, en raison de son absence en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, de fournir une prestation de travail pour laquelle elle recevrait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, l'allocation de maternit\u00e9 vers\u00e9e par l'employeur vient combler la situation d\u00e9savantageuse dans laquelle elle se retrouve et elle ne constitue pas une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.12\n[36] Le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal est d'avis que cette d\u00e9cision s'applique aux faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier. Il importe de pr\u00e9ciser que la d\u00e9cision Dumont-Ferlatte a fait l'objet d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada-Division de premi\u00e8re instance. La juge Tremblay-Lamer a rejet\u00e9 la demande. Au paragraphe 46 du jugement, elle \u00e9crit :\nIl ressort de la preuve devant le Tribunal que le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 est un cong\u00e9 sans solde. Du fait de l'absence de prestation de travail en raison de la maternit\u00e9, l'employ\u00e9e ne re\u00e7oit aucune r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. C'est donc \u00e0 bon droit que le Tribunal a compar\u00e9 le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 avec les autres cong\u00e9s sans solde pr\u00e9vus dans les conventions collectives, dont notamment le cong\u00e9 de paternit\u00e9 sans solde, le cong\u00e9 d'adoption sans solde, le cong\u00e9 sans solde visant les soins et l'\u00e9ducation des enfants d'\u00e2ge pr\u00e9scolaire, le cong\u00e9 sans solde pour r\u00e9installation du conjoint, le cong\u00e9 sans solde pour besoins personnels, le cong\u00e9 de maladie sans solde, le cong\u00e9 sans solde pour \u00e9tudes et perfectionnement, le cong\u00e9 militaire sans solde, le cong\u00e9 sans solde en vue de la participation aux activit\u00e9s d'un organisme international, le cong\u00e9 sans solde lors de la candidature \u00e0 une \u00e9lection et le cong\u00e9 sans solde pour activit\u00e9s syndicales.13\n[37] Ainsi, le Tribunal conclut que la plaignante doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant en cong\u00e9 sans solde. La plaignante ne peut se comparer aux employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res non enceintes qui ne sont pas en cong\u00e9 sans solde. Ce groupe ne constitue pas le groupe comparatif appropri\u00e9.\n[38] En l'esp\u00e8ce, il faut aussi consid\u00e9rer l'absence de prestation de travail de la plaignante. Dans l'affaire Cramm c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada 14, le Tribunal d'appel des droits de la personne \u00e9crit :\nSelon nous, le raisonnement dans Dumont-Ferlatte est en outre plus coh\u00e9rent avec la nature essentielle du contrat de travail. \u00c0 titre de rappel : l'obligation de payer de l'employeur est conditionnelle au travail effectu\u00e9. Il n'existe pas d'obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour les employeurs de r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer les employ\u00e9s qui ne fournissent pas de services.15\n[39] L'affaire Cramm a fait l'objet d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire qui fut rejet\u00e9e. Dans cet arr\u00eat, le juge MacKay \u00e9crit :\nLa Commission a soutenu que le Tribunal avait commis une erreur en examinant la nature du contrat d'emploi, pour conclure qu'il n'y avait pas de preuve prima facie de discrimination. Le Tribunal d'appel l'a fait en examinant l'objet du RGER, \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel \u00e0 l'examen des r\u00e8gles relatives \u00e0 l'emploi, conform\u00e9ment au raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Gibbs. \u00c0 mon avis, la nature de la r\u00e8gle, fond\u00e9e sur le principe du contrat d'emploi selon lequel une personne est pay\u00e9e pour les services fournis, est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel \u00e0 l'examen de son objet. (...)16\n[40] La plaignante ne re\u00e7oit pas de l'intim\u00e9 des PSCM en consid\u00e9ration d'une prestation de travail. Or, les employ\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers ne sont pas dans la m\u00eame situation que la plaignante, la raison \u00e9tant que leur r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est en contrepartie d'une prestation de travail. Certes, l'employ\u00e9 r\u00e9gulier qui quitte en milieu de l'ann\u00e9e scolaire aura droit au remboursement du montant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu pour assurer l'\u00e9talement sur 26 semaines. Cependant, le calcul des sommes pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es en trop est en consid\u00e9ration du travail effectu\u00e9 pour lequel une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration X a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal ne peut comparer la situation de la plaignante avec les employ\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8res non enceintes qui fournissent une prestation de travail.\n[41] Ainsi, le Tribunal conclut que la plaignante n'a pas \u00e9tabli par une preuve prima facie que l'intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en raison de sa grossesse.\nB. Le remboursement des cong\u00e9s de maladie [42] Pour ce volet de la plainte, la plaignante consid\u00e8re que l'intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en refusant de lui rembourser les cong\u00e9s de maladie accumul\u00e9s pendant son absence pour cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. La plaignante s'appuie sur la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001. Cette politique pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n22.1 L'employ\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 conserve ses jours de cong\u00e9 de maladie et demeure couverte par le r\u00e9gime d'assurance en vigueur.\n[43] Pour l'intim\u00e9, la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001 soumise par la plaignante ne s'applique pas. L'intim\u00e9 soutient que la politique en vigueur au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante a exerc\u00e9 son droit \u00e0 un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 \u00e9tait la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mars 2003. Or, l'article 22.1 n'appara\u00eet plus dans cette politique ni \u00e0 celle ant\u00e9rieure, soit la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai-2002.\n[44] Par cons\u00e9quent, l'intim\u00e9 ne reconna\u00eet plus \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 le droit de monnayer ses cong\u00e9s de maladie qu'elle aurait accumul\u00e9s pendant son absence.\n[45] Pour la plaignante, c'est la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001 qui s'applique puisque l'intim\u00e9 ne lui a jamais communiqu\u00e9 les politiques de l'\u00e9cole mars 2003 et mai 2002.\n[46] Cela dit, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si en refusant de lui rembourser les cong\u00e9s de maladie accumul\u00e9s pendant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plaignante. Dans un premier temps, le Tribunal doit v\u00e9rifier l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[47] Il ressort de la preuve que l'intim\u00e9 justifie son refus de rembourser \u00e0 la plaignante les cong\u00e9s de maladie accumul\u00e9s, car selon l'intim\u00e9, la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001 ne s'appliquait plus (Pi\u00e8ce P-11, p. 3). Or, il est \u00e9tabli que la plaignante n'a jamais re\u00e7u copie des politiques de l'\u00e9cole de mai 2002 et de mars 2003. En tenant pour acquis que l'intim\u00e9 se devait d'appliquer la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001 \u00e0 la plaignante puisqu'il n'avait pas notifi\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re qu'elle ne s'appliquait plus, le Tribunal ne peut conclure \u00e0 une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[48] Le refus de l'intim\u00e9 d'appliquer la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001, ne constitue pas en soi, une preuve prima facie de discrimination envers la plaignante. Certes, il existe une m\u00e9sentente entre les parties portant sur le bien-fond\u00e9 ou non de la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9 d'appliquer une politique jamais communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante. Cependant, le Tribunal ne peut faire de lien entre cette m\u00e9sentente et le motif de distinction illicite qu'est la grossesse.\n[49] Malgr\u00e9 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et en tenant pour acquis que la plaignante ait \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que l'ensemble de la preuve soumise ne d\u00e9montre pas que l'intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination envers la plaignante. Dans sa lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Pi\u00e8ce I-3), le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9crit qu'une disposition leur permet de modifier une politique avant le d\u00e9but de chaque ann\u00e9e scolaire. Les politiques de l'\u00e9cole de mai-2002 et de mars-2003 pr\u00e9voient une telle disposition. La politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001 pr\u00e9cise ce qui suit : La pr\u00e9sente politique peut \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e par le Conseil en place.. L'intim\u00e9 s'\u00e9tait donc r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de modifier la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001. C'est ce qu'il a fait en r\u00e9visant et modifiant cette politique \u00e0 deux reprises. Par cons\u00e9quent, le refus de l'intim\u00e9 d'appliquer la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001 n'est pas un pr\u00e9texte et constitue une explication raisonnable.\n[50] Relativement au refus de l'intim\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre \u00e0 une employ\u00e9e r\u00e9guli\u00e8re enceinte la possibilit\u00e9 de monnayer les cong\u00e9s de maladie accumul\u00e9s pendant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, le Tribunal a analys\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage du repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9 et la lettre qu'il a adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante (Pi\u00e8ce P-8). De cette preuve, le Tribunal comprend que lorsque le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9crit \u00e0 la plaignante (Pi\u00e8ce P-8) et qu'il r\u00e9pond aux questions de Me Jos\u00e9 Rondeau, avocate de la plaignante, sur les cong\u00e9s de maladie, il se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la politique qu'il consid\u00e8re applicable, \u00e0 savoir la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mars 2003. Or, la raison pour laquelle cette politique de l'\u00e9cole-mars 2003 ne reconna\u00eet plus cet avantage, r\u00e9side dans le fait que, selon le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9, les employ\u00e9es en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es en cong\u00e9 sans solde. Comme ils n'ont pas travaill\u00e9, les employ\u00e9s en cong\u00e9 sans solde ne peuvent accumuler des cong\u00e9s de maladie pendant leur absence. De l'avis du Tribunal, la d\u00e9cision Dumont-Ferlatte 17 confirme le bien-fond\u00e9 d'une telle justification.\n[51] Certes, l'intim\u00e9 aurait pu maintenir l'avantage reconnu \u00e0 l'article 22.1 de la politique de l'\u00e9cole-mai 2001. Cependant, la d\u00e9cision de retirer cet avantage et les raisons invoqu\u00e9es au soutien de ce retrait constituent une explication raisonnable qui n'est pas un pr\u00e9texte.\n[52] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que la plaignante n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination et que, advenant o\u00f9 elle l'aurait fait, l'intim\u00e9 a donn\u00e9 une explication raisonnable qui n'est pas un pr\u00e9texte ni contraire \u00e0 la Loi.\nV. Conclusion [53] Le Tribunal conclut que la plaignante n'a pas \u00e9tabli qu'elle a fait l'objet de discrimination.\n[54] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nsign\u00e9e par\nKathleen Cahill\nOTTAWA, Ontario Le 29 ao\u00fbt 2006\n1 L.R.

Grant Sinclair\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Dans sa requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 24 juillet 2006, la plaignante, Kathleen Moore, a demand\u00e9 que sa plainte soit modifi\u00e9e en vue d'ajouter des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9es sur l'article 10 et sur le paragraphe 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). Quant \u00e0 la modification relative au paragraphe 14.1, le point de vue de l'intim\u00e9e est qu'il ne s'oppose pas, ni ne consent, \u00e0 ce que l'on apporte cette modification. Les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui d\u00e9montrent que les crit\u00e8res qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par le Tribunal dans de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions pour qu'une telle modification puisse \u00eatre apport\u00e9e sont satisfaits. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte est modifi\u00e9e afin d'ajouter les all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur le paragraphe 14.1 de la Loi.\n[2] En s'opposant \u00e0 la demande de modification relative \u00e0 l'article 10, l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend d'abord que, en vertu de l'article 51 de la Loi, c'est la Commission qui est le gardien de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Seule la Commission, et non un plaignant, peut avancer des all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9es sur l'article 10 et demander une r\u00e9paration syst\u00e9mique en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi. La Commission s'est retir\u00e9e des pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures et n'a pas demand\u00e9 que l'on apporte une telle modification.\n[3] L'intim\u00e9e invoque \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Toth et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Kitchener Aero Avionics, 2005 TCDP 19, plus particuli\u00e8rement le raisonnement du Tribunal figurant au paragraphe 37 de cette d\u00e9cision. Dans ce paragraphe, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es par la plaignante sont personnelles et compensatoires et qu'elles ne mettent pas en cause l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[4] En examinant l'argument de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9finir l'expression int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui figure \u00e0 l'article 51 de la Loi. Il suffit d'affirmer que l'article 51 est silencieux quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 d'un plaignant individuel de d\u00e9poser une plainte d\u00e9non\u00e7ant une pratique discriminatoire syst\u00e9mique. En fait, l'article 40 de la Loi permet express\u00e9ment \u00e0 un individu ou \u00e0 un groupe d'individus de d\u00e9poser une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission. Cet article n'interdit pas le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte syst\u00e9mique individuelle.\n[5] Il n'y a rien non plus dans l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi qui assujetti le Tribunal \u00e0 certaines restrictions lorsqu'il est question d'accorder une r\u00e9paration syst\u00e9mique et que le plaignant est une personne et non pas la Commission. La Loi pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment les cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal est assujetti \u00e0 des restrictions lorsqu'il accorde l'une des mesures r\u00e9paratrices pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 53. Pensons par exemple au paragraphe 54(1).\n[6] Dans la d\u00e9cision Toth, le Tribunal devait se prononcer sur une requ\u00eate en res judicata et non pas sur une requ\u00eate en vue d'ajouter \u00e0 la plainte une all\u00e9gation fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10. Selon moi, les commentaires du Tribunal figurant au paragraphe 37 doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s dans le contexte des faits particuliers de l'esp\u00e8ce et il y a lieu d'\u00e9tablir une distinction d'avec la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce.\n[7] M\u00eame si la d\u00e9cision Toth peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme limitant le plaignant \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration personnelle et compensatoire, elle est incompatible avec la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Aleta Gaucher et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1.\n[8] Dans la d\u00e9cision Gaucher, la Commission a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier une plainte en vue d'ajouter une all\u00e9gation fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10. Le Tribunal a conclu qu'aucune modification n'\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire mais il a accord\u00e9 la modification visant \u00e0 clarifier, comme il l'a affirm\u00e9, les aspects juridiques de la situation. Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 (au paragraphe 15) que l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi ne fait pas de distinction entre les aspects personnels et les aspects syst\u00e9miques d'une plainte et que c'est une erreur que de faire une dichotomie entre les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 7 et celles d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 10 de la Loi.\n[9] Je ne suis pas li\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision Toth et je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le raisonnement qu'a fait le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Gaucher. Cette affaire porte sur la m\u00eame question que celle dont il est question en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[10] Pour ces motifs, j'ai conclu que la plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce peut, dans le cadre de sa plainte actuelle, pr\u00e9tendre que l'intim\u00e9e s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des pratiques de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et peut demander une r\u00e9paration syst\u00e9mique. Elle peut faire cela sans modifier sa plainte. \u00c9videmment, c'est au Tribunal qui entend la plainte de d\u00e9cider si oui ou non il fera droit \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations et, dans l'affirmative, si une r\u00e9paration syst\u00e9mique constitue la r\u00e9paration appropri\u00e9e dans les circonstances.\n[11] Je tiens \u00e0 signaler que la requ\u00eate de la plaignante et les observations faites par les deux avocats ont eu des r\u00e9sultats tr\u00e8s b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques. L'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu \u00e0 maintes reprises et, \u00e0 juste titre, qu'il ne sait pas exactement quelle preuve il doit r\u00e9futer.\n[12] Dans les documents qu'elle a soumis \u00e0 l'appui de sa requ\u00eate ainsi que dans son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, la plaignante a maintenant clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les faits sur lesquels elle se fonde, les questions en litige soulev\u00e9es par sa plainte et les r\u00e9parations qu'elle demande. Tant mieux, cela devrait apaiser les craintes de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[13] Certaines questions incidentes ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audience. La plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de fournir des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires tel que mentionn\u00e9 aux paragraphes 51 \u00e0 56 de son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e examinera ces demandes et fera part de son point de vue \u00e0 la plaignante au plus tard le 6 octobre 2006.\n[14] Enfin, le Tribunal a fix\u00e9 provisoirement une nouvelle date d'audience de la plainte. L'audience commencera \u00e0 Thunder Bay dans la semaine du 2 au 5 avril 2007, elle se poursuivra dans la semaine du 10 au 13 avril et, si n\u00e9cessaire, elle reprendra le 23 avril 2007.\nJ.

LES FAITS A. La plainte de M. Buffett [1] Le plaignant, Terry Buffett, est un adjudant des Forces canadiennes (FC). Il all\u00e8gue que les FC l'ont priv\u00e9 d'un avantage en mati\u00e8re d'emploi en refusant de payer une proc\u00e9dure m\u00e9dicale de reproduction (f\u00e9condation in vitro). Il pr\u00e9tend que ce refus constitue un traitement diff\u00e9rent et pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience (infertilit\u00e9 masculine), son sexe et sa situation de famille, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). Il all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement que le refus des FC reposait sur une politique discriminatoire contraire \u00e0 l'article 10 de la Loi.\n[2] De leur c\u00f4t\u00e9, les FC soutiennent que la discrimination n'a jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans leur d\u00e9cision de refuser le financement. Elles offrent une assurance-maladie financ\u00e9e par des deniers publics \u00e0 leurs membres seulement. Or, c'est la conjointe de M. Buffet, qui n'est pas une militaire, qui ferait l'objet de la proc\u00e9dure m\u00e9dicale en question. M. Buffett n'a donc pas le droit de recevoir des fonds pour cette proc\u00e9dure dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC.\n[3] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessous, j'estime que la plainte de M. Buffett est fond\u00e9e.\nB. Pourquoi M. Buffett a-t-il demand\u00e9 des fonds pour la proc\u00e9dure de reproduction? [4] M. Buffett, qui est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 44 ans, fait partie des FC depuis 1979. Lui et sa femme, Rhonda Buffett, sont mari\u00e9s depuis 1985. Mme Buffet est maintenant \u00e2g\u00e9e de 45 ans. Le couple ayant de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir un enfant, il a consult\u00e9 des professionnels du domaine de la fertilit\u00e9. En 1995, M. Buffett a re\u00e7u un diagnostic d'infertilit\u00e9 masculine. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que le nombre de spermatozo\u00efdes dans son sperme \u00e9tait faible et que leur mobilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la normale. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que la morphologie de ses spermatozo\u00efdes (leur forme et leur structure) \u00e9tait bien inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la normale.\n[5] M. Buffett a subi, en juillet 1995, une intervention m\u00e9dicale appel\u00e9e embolisation de varicoc\u00e8le, dans le but d'am\u00e9liorer la qualit\u00e9 de son sperme. La technique consiste \u00e0 traiter une veine dilat\u00e9e entourant le testicule, dont la pr\u00e9sence peut modifier les param\u00e8tres du sperme. Les analyses de suivi du sperme de M. Buffett n'ont toutefois r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'une l\u00e9g\u00e8re am\u00e9lioration de la mobilit\u00e9 et de la morphologie des spermatozo\u00efdes, ainsi que de leur nombre. En f\u00e9vrier 1996, l'urologue de M. Buffett, le docteur Mark Nigro, qui est un expert en infertilit\u00e9 masculine, a recommand\u00e9 le recours \u00e0 des [traduction] techniques de reproduction avanc\u00e9es, \u00e0 savoir la f\u00e9condation in vitro (FIV) et l'injection intracytoplasmique de spermatozo\u00efdes (IICS), ce qu'il consid\u00e9rait \u00eatre la [traduction] prochaine \u00e9tape \u00e0 laquelle devait logiquement passer le couple pour satisfaire son d\u00e9sir de procr\u00e9ation.\nC. Qu'est-ce que la FIV et l'IICS? [6] La FIV est une technique qui consiste \u00e0 f\u00e9conder dans une \u00e9prouvette les ovules d'une femme avant de les transf\u00e9rer dans son ut\u00e9rus. Au d\u00e9but du processus (ou cycle), la femme s'auto-administre des injections d'un m\u00e9dicament pendant dix jours afin de stimuler le fonctionnement de ses ovaires et la maturation de ses ovocytes et follicules. Une \u00e9chographie est r\u00e9alis\u00e9e tous les 2 ou 3 jours afin de suivre la croissance des ovocytes dans ses ovaires. Lorsqu'au moins trois follicules ont atteint une taille donn\u00e9e, la femme s'auto-injecte un m\u00e9dicament qui permet aux ovocytes de terminer leur maturation. Trente-six heures plus tard, la femme subit une intervention appel\u00e9e r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des ovocytes par voie vaginale. On administre \u00e0 la femme un s\u00e9datif et on introduit une aiguille dans l'ovaire. Les ovocytes sont extraits des follicules. Ils sont ensuite mis en pr\u00e9sence du sperme (qui contient environ 6 500 spermatozo\u00efdes) dans une \u00e9prouvette incub\u00e9e, o\u00f9 la f\u00e9condation a lieu naturellement. On v\u00e9rifie chaque jour les ovocytes et, s'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 f\u00e9cond\u00e9s, on introduit les embryons ainsi obtenus dans l'ut\u00e9rus de la femme, trois \u00e0 cinq jours apr\u00e8s la f\u00e9condation, \u00e0 l'aide d'un cath\u00e9ter. Si les r\u00e8gles ne se d\u00e9clenchent pas dans les 17 jours qui suivent, un test de grossesse est r\u00e9alis\u00e9.\n[7] Lorsque le sperme utilis\u00e9 contient trop peu de spermatozo\u00efdes normaux et mobiles, le taux de r\u00e9ussite de la FIV s'est av\u00e9r\u00e9 jusqu'ici tr\u00e8s faible, oscillant entre 4 et 6 p. 100. Le docteur Nigro a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les endocrinologues sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s en m\u00e9decine de la reproduction ne recommandent pas d'utiliser uniquement la FIV dans les cas d'anomalies des spermatozo\u00efdes. La solution privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e est le recours combin\u00e9 \u00e0 la FIV et \u00e0 l'IICS, proc\u00e9d\u00e9 qui consiste \u00e0 isoler des spermatozo\u00efdes normaux, par leur aspect et leur mobilit\u00e9, \u00e0 partir d'un \u00e9jaculat de l'homme. Un de ces spermatozo\u00efdes est inject\u00e9 directement dans l'ovocyte \u00e0 l'aide d'un microscope et d'une aiguille fine qui permet des micromanipulations. La m\u00e9thode d'incubation et de transfert des embryons dans l'ut\u00e9rus de la femme est la m\u00eame que celle employ\u00e9e dans la FIV.\n[8] Le docteur Arthur Leader, qui est professeur d'obst\u00e9trique, de gyn\u00e9cologie et de m\u00e9decine (endocrinologie) \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 d'Ottawa, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'expert en endocrinologie de la reproduction et en infertilit\u00e9. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il faut mobiliser jusqu'\u00e0 30 personnes pour r\u00e9aliser un seul cycle de traitement de FIV. D'o\u00f9 le co\u00fbt non n\u00e9gligeable de l'intervention. Selon le docteur Leader, le co\u00fbt actuel de la FIV se situe entre 5 500 et 6 000 $ par cycle, auquel s'ajoute une somme de 1 100 \u00e0 1 300 $ par cycle si on fait \u00e9galement appel \u00e0 l'IICS. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'en 1997, peu apr\u00e8s que la technique eut \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois au couple Buffet, le co\u00fbt s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 environ 3 000 $ par cycle de FIV, plus un montant suppl\u00e9mentaire de 1 500 $ par cycle de FIV en cas de recours \u00e0 l'IICS. Les estimations des co\u00fbts actuels des interventions faites par le docteur Nigro rejoignaient celles du docteur Leader (6 000 $ par cycle de FIV et une somme additionnelle de 1 500 $ par cycle de FIV en cas de recours \u00e0 l'IICS).\n[9] En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le docteur Leader ne recommande pas plus de trois cycles de FIV ou de FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS \u00e0 ses patientes, lesquelles ont 35 ans en moyenne. Les recherches montrent que chez les femmes dans la trentaine avanc\u00e9e ou plus \u00e2g\u00e9es qui ne deviennent pas enceintes au terme de trois tentatives, il est peu probable que l'intervention donne un jour des r\u00e9sultats.\n[10] D'apr\u00e8s le docteur Leader, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'introduction de l'IICS, le taux de grossesse obtenu lorsqu'on utilise des spermatozo\u00efdes de pi\u00e8tre qualit\u00e9 est maintenant comparable au taux de grossesse associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la FIV pratiqu\u00e9e avec du sperme de qualit\u00e9 normale, soit environ 30 p. 100 par cycle.\n[11] Trente pour cent des cas o\u00f9 un embryon est implant\u00e9 dans l'ut\u00e9rus d'une femme aboutissent \u00e0 la naissance d'un enfant. Ce pourcentage chute \u00e0 mesure que la femme, ou l'homme qui fournit les spermatozo\u00efdes, avance en \u00e2ge, en raison d'un risque accru de fausse couche, surtout apr\u00e8s 40 ans. Le docteur Leader est d'avis qu'il n'est pas recommand\u00e9 aux femmes de plus de 42 ans de recourir \u00e0 la FIV et \u00e0 la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'existe aucun cas recens\u00e9 de traitement r\u00e9ussi chez des femmes de plus de 43 ans.\nD. Les r\u00e9gimes provinciaux d'assurance-maladie financent-ils la FIV et la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS? [12] Lorsque le docteur Nigro a recommand\u00e9 la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS, M. Buffett \u00e9tait en poste \u00e0 la Station des Forces canadiennes Aldergrove en Colombie-Britannique. Les Buffett r\u00e9sidaient donc dans cette province \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. En 1996, M. Buffett a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la base de Gagetown, au Nouveau-Brunswick, o\u00f9 le couple s'est install\u00e9. Les r\u00e9gimes de sant\u00e9 publics de ces provinces ne payaient pas le co\u00fbt des traitements de FIV. En fait, \u00e0 part le r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 de l'Ontario, aucun des r\u00e9gimes de sant\u00e9 provinciaux au Canada n' a jamais financ\u00e9 les traitements de FIV.\n[13] Jusqu'en 1993, l'assurance-sant\u00e9 de l'Ontario (OHIP) payait la FIV pour les femmes, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la cause de l'infertilit\u00e9. En 1993, la province a retir\u00e9 la FIV de sa liste de services assur\u00e9s, sauf pour les femmes ayant les deux trompes de Fallope obstru\u00e9es, un trouble connu sous le nom d'obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope.\n[14] La FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 assur\u00e9e par un r\u00e9gime provincial. Toutes les provinces payent cependant le co\u00fbt des examens reli\u00e9s aux probl\u00e8mes d'infertilit\u00e9.\n[15] C'est donc dire que toute personne d\u00e9sirant avoir recours \u00e0 la FIV ou \u00e0 la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS qui r\u00e9side \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de l'Ontario ou tout Ontarien souhaitant recourir \u00e0 ces traitements qui n'est pas une femme souffrant d'une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope devra en assumer les co\u00fbts. Le docteur Leader a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que ces interventions sont habituellement effectu\u00e9es dans des cliniques priv\u00e9es; il y a 24 cliniques de ce genre au Canada.\nE. Le r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC [16] Au Canada, le syst\u00e8me public d'assurance-maladie rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence des provinces selon la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. Le gouvernement du Canada contribue cependant au co\u00fbt de la prestation des services de sant\u00e9 dans chaque province, sous r\u00e9serve de certains crit\u00e8res et de certaines conditions, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur la sant\u00e9, L.R.C. 1985, ch. C-6. L'une de ces conditions veut que tout habitant d'une province soit r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un assur\u00e9 dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 de la province, \u00e0 l'exception de certaines cat\u00e9gories de personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. Les membres des FC constituent l'une de ces cat\u00e9gories (article 2). Ceux-ci ne sont donc assur\u00e9s par aucun r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 provincial au Canada.\n[17] Afin que ses membres ne soient pas priv\u00e9s d'une assurance-maladie financ\u00e9e par l'\u00c9tat, les FC se sont charg\u00e9es de fournir des soins de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs membres. Selon le chapitre 34 des Ordonnances et r\u00e8glements royaux applicables aux Forces canadiennes (ORFC), publi\u00e9s en application du paragraphe 12(2) de la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale, L.R.C. 1985, ch. N-5, les FC doivent fournir \u00e0 leurs membres des soins de sant\u00e9 financ\u00e9s par des deniers publics. On entend par soins de sant\u00e9 les traitements m\u00e9dicaux et chirurgicaux, les traitements relatifs au diagnostic et aux examens, l'hospitalisation, les traitements relatifs \u00e0 la m\u00e9decine pr\u00e9ventive, le transport du patient, ainsi que la distribution et l'entretien des appareils proth\u00e9tiques (article 34.01 des ORFC). En fait, les FC fournissent des soins de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs membres selon une \u00e9chelle semblable aux r\u00e9gimes de sant\u00e9 provinciaux. On pourrait m\u00eame consid\u00e9rer que la protection offerte par le r\u00e9gime des FC est plus \u00e9tendue que celle assur\u00e9e habituellement par les r\u00e9gimes provinciaux. Par exemple, les FC paient tous les m\u00e9dicaments, les traitements de physioth\u00e9rapie, les services sociaux et les soins dentaires. Le r\u00e9gime est tellement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux que certains l'ont qualifi\u00e9 de 14e r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 du Canada, apr\u00e8s ceux des dix provinces et des trois territoires.\n[18] Les Services de sant\u00e9 des Forces canadiennes (SSFC), un groupe existant au sein des FC, constituent le fournisseur d\u00e9sign\u00e9 des services m\u00e9dicaux aux militaires. Les SSFC ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 une vaste infrastructure pour la prestation des services \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur et \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du Canada. Ils comptent un groupe de professionnels de la sant\u00e9 en uniforme, notamment des omnipraticiens, des sp\u00e9cialistes, des infirmiers, des pharmaciens, des administrateurs, des travailleurs sociaux, des adjoints m\u00e9dicaux et des techniciens m\u00e9dicaux. Les FC emploient \u00e9galement un certain nombre d'experts m\u00e9dicaux civils, sur une base contractuelle, pour fournir des soins \u00e0 leurs membres.\n[19] Lorsqu'un militaire a besoin des services d'un professionnel de la sant\u00e9 civil, ce dernier facture ses services aux FC. Ainsi, dans le cas de M. Buffett par exemple, un m\u00e9decin des FC employ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital de la Base des Forces canadiennes \u00e0 Chilliwack l'a dirig\u00e9 vers le docteur Nigro, un sp\u00e9cialiste de Vancouver. Le docteur Nigro n'est pas employ\u00e9 par les FC. Il a factur\u00e9 aux FC ses services professionnels, y compris les frais du traitement et des examens subis par M. Buffett.\n[20] La Brigadi\u00e8re-g\u00e9n\u00e9rale Hillary Frances Jaeger a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience au sujet du r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC. En qualit\u00e9 de chef des SSFC, elle doit notamment s'occuper des normes et de la d\u00e9ontologie professionnelles, r\u00e9partir le travail entre les membres du personnel m\u00e9dical et \u00e9laborer une politique clinique. Elle voit son r\u00f4le comme celui du chef du personnel m\u00e9dical d'un h\u00f4pital civil typique. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 des FC vise deux grands objectifs : offrir aux militaires des soins de sant\u00e9 qui sont [traduction] \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s comparables \u00e0 ceux auxquels ils auraient droit s'ils n'\u00e9taient pas membres des FC et faire en sorte qu'ils soient [traduction] en aussi bonne forme que possible pour pouvoir s'acquitter de leurs t\u00e2ches d'une fa\u00e7on qui r\u00e9pond aux attentes des FC.\nF. Les FC fournissent-elles des services de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 des personnes qui, comme Rhonda Buffett, sont des membres de la famille d'un militaire? [21] Les FC ne fournissent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas de soins de sant\u00e9 financ\u00e9s par des fonds publics aux familles de leurs membres. Aux termes de l'article 34.23 des ORFC, des services m\u00e9dicaux peuvent \u00eatre prodigu\u00e9s aux personnes \u00e0 charge des militaires (c.-\u00e0-d. leurs conjoints et enfants) dans certaines circonstances exceptionnelles, notamment en cas d'urgence ou lorsque ces personnes accompagnent le membre des FC dans un lieu o\u00f9 il n'y a aucune installation m\u00e9dicale civile qui soit appropri\u00e9e, par exemple \u00e0 Goose Bay, \u00e0 Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador. Vu la taille relativement petite de cette communaut\u00e9 et son isolement g\u00e9ographique, il arrive r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement que les personnes \u00e0 charge des militaires qui y sont stationn\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent des soins de sant\u00e9 des SSFC. Ces personnes \u00e9tant des habitants de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador pendant qu'elles vivent sur la base, les FC facturent directement le co\u00fbt des services qui leur sont fournis au r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 de la province.\n[22] Sauf dans ces circonstances exceptionnelles, les personnes \u00e0 charge des militaires doivent recevoir des services de sant\u00e9 assur\u00e9s du gouvernement de la province o\u00f9 ils habitent. Les membres des familles des militaires sont cependant admissibles \u00e0 la protection suppl\u00e9mentaire offerte par le R\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 de la fonction publique (RSSFP). Le RSSFP est un r\u00e9gime d'assurance-maladie financ\u00e9 par l'employeur auquel tous les militaires peuvent participer et qui offre une protection suppl\u00e9mentaire aux membres de leur famille. Il est financ\u00e9 au moyen de contributions vers\u00e9es par l'employeur et les militaires. Il fournit une couverture partielle additionnelle pour les services qui ne sont pas assur\u00e9s par les r\u00e9gimes de sant\u00e9 provinciaux, comme les m\u00e9dicaments sur ordonnance, les soins dentaires et les lunettes. M. Buffett s'est procur\u00e9 cette protection pour sa femme.\nG. Le r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC finance-t-il les traitements de FIV combin\u00e9e ou non avec une IICS des militaires? [23] Jusqu'en 1997, le r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC ne d\u00e9frayait pas le co\u00fbt des traitements de FIV ou de FIV combin\u00e9e avec une IICS. Cette politique a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en septembre 1997. Une femme membre des FC cantonn\u00e9e en Ontario avait demand\u00e9 le remboursement du co\u00fbt de son traitement de FIV, faisant valoir qu'elle aurait eu droit, en tant que civile habitant en Ontario, \u00e0 ce que le co\u00fbt de l'intervention soit d\u00e9fray\u00e9 par l'\u00c9tat. Elle pr\u00e9tendait qu'il \u00e9tait injuste que la politique des FC en mati\u00e8re de soins de sant\u00e9 soit plus restrictive que celle appliqu\u00e9e par le r\u00e9gime provincial correspondant, soit l'OHIP.\n[24] Sa demande ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, la militaire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief. Celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli et le financement lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9. Les FC ont ajout\u00e9 par la suite la FIV \u00e0 leur liste de services assur\u00e9s. Elles prennent en compte diff\u00e9rents facteurs avant d'ajouter un service de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 leur liste de services assur\u00e9s, notamment la possibilit\u00e9 que les r\u00e9gimes de sant\u00e9 provinciaux d\u00e9frayent le co\u00fbt du service en question. Comme la Bg\u00e9n Jaeger l'a expliqu\u00e9, cette mesure a pour but de voir \u00e0 ce que les membres des FC ne soient pas priv\u00e9s de services de sant\u00e9 auxquels ils auraient normalement droit, simplement parce qu'ils sont des militaires.\n[25] Selon la Bg\u00e9n Jaeger, c'est notamment pour cette raison que les FC ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'ajouter la FIV \u00e0 leur liste de services assur\u00e9s. Le grief a mis en \u00e9vidence le fait que l'OHIP assurait d\u00e9j\u00e0 ce traitement dans certaines circonstances particuli\u00e8res (obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope). Les FC ont modifi\u00e9 leur politique pour offrir la m\u00eame protection \u00e0 leurs membres.\n[26] Les fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9 au sein des FC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s de ce changement par un message \u00e9crit envoy\u00e9 par le chef des SSFC au Quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la D\u00e9fense nationale le 15 septembre 1997. Le message indiquait que la FIV \u00e9tait dor\u00e9navant autoris\u00e9e et pouvait \u00eatre approuv\u00e9e par des responsables au sein de l'unit\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait recommand\u00e9e par un sp\u00e9cialiste des techniques de reproduction. Le co\u00fbt de trois s\u00e9ances, au maximum, serait d\u00e9fray\u00e9, comme le pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement la politique de l'OHIP. Fait int\u00e9ressant, le message ne pr\u00e9cisait pas si, comme c'\u00e9tait le cas sous le r\u00e9gime de l'OHIP apr\u00e8s 1993, les nouvelles r\u00e8gles s'appliquaient seulement aux femmes ayant une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope.\nH. Qu'a fait M. Buffett lorsqu'il a appris le changement apport\u00e9 \u00e0 la politique des FC? [27] Peu de temps apr\u00e8s que le docteur Nigro eut propos\u00e9, en f\u00e9vrier 1996, d'examiner la solution de la FIV combin\u00e9e avec une IICS, M. Buffett a rencontr\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin des FC pour discuter de la question. Le m\u00e9decin des FC lui a dit que ce type d'intervention n'\u00e9tait pas assur\u00e9 par le r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 des FC. Les Buffett habitaient en Colombie-Britannique \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Ils ont d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 au Nouveau-Brunswick plus tard au cours de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Comme les r\u00e9gimes de sant\u00e9 de ces deux provinces ne d\u00e9frayaient pas le co\u00fbt de cette proc\u00e9dure, il aurait fallu que le couple en assume lui-m\u00eame le co\u00fbt. M. Buffett et sa femme ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'ils n'en avaient pas les moyens et ils se sont r\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e0 n'avoir peut-\u00eatre jamais d'enfant biologique.\n[28] Leurs attentes ont cependant radicalement chang\u00e9 quand un infirmier des FC, travaillant \u00e0 la BFC de Gagetown, que M. Buffett connaissait, lui a transmis une copie du message envoy\u00e9 par le Quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la D\u00e9fense nationale en septembre 1997, annon\u00e7ant la modification apport\u00e9e \u00e0 la politique concernant le financement des traitements de FIV. M. Buffett a alors communiqu\u00e9 avec un m\u00e9decin des FC travaillant sur la base et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de financement en bonne et due forme. La demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise au m\u00e9decin-chef de la base, qui a refus\u00e9 d'accorder les fonds demand\u00e9s parce que [traduction] la FIV n'est assur\u00e9e que dans une province (l'Ontario) et que le financement \u00e9tait offert [traduction] seulement dans les cas d'obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes.\n[29] Le 10 novembre 1998, M. Buffett a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief contestant cette d\u00e9cision. Il a fait valoir que le message original envoy\u00e9 par le Quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la D\u00e9fense nationale pour annoncer la modification apport\u00e9e \u00e0 la politique ne mentionnait pas que la protection \u00e9tait offerte seulement aux patientes ayant une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope. Selon lui, cette restriction cr\u00e9ait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Les militaires de sexe masculin se voyaient priv\u00e9s d'avantages auxquels leurs coll\u00e8gues f\u00e9minines avaient droit \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les hommes ne peuvent physiologiquement \u00eatre atteints d'affections touchant les trompes de Fallope.\n[30] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure des FC, le grief de M. Buffett a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 et comment\u00e9 par ses officiers sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents niveaux. Le pouvoir d'accorder le redressement demand\u00e9 appartenait cependant, en dernier ressort, au chef d'\u00e9tat-major de la D\u00e9fense. Certains des officiers qui ont examin\u00e9 le grief de M. Buffett appuyaient sa demande. Son commandant, le Lieutenant-colonel J. M. Duhamel, a \u00e9crit, le 30 novembre 1998, que les pr\u00e9tentions de M. Buffett \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es, ajoutant que [traduction] le fait de faire d\u00e9pendre l'admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 une FIV financ\u00e9e par des deniers publics d'une condition applicable uniquement aux militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 exclure les militaires de sexe masculin \u00e0 cause de leur sexe.\n[31] Le Bg\u00e9n D. W. Foster, commandant de la Force terrestre dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Atlantique, a adopt\u00e9 une position semblable lorsqu'il a examin\u00e9 le grief \u00e0 son tour. Il a indiqu\u00e9 que l'[traduction] argument de deux poids deux mesures [invoqu\u00e9 par M. Buffett] est bien fond\u00e9, ajoutant qu'il croyait, [traduction] en toute justice, que la FIV devrait \u00eatre offerte \u00e0 M. Buffett [traduction] comme elle le serait \u00e0 la famille d'une militaire.\n[32] D'autres personnes n'\u00e9taient pas de cet avis. Le Lieutenant-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral W. C. Leach, chef d'\u00e9tat-major de l'Arm\u00e9e de terre, par exemple, ne pensait pas que la question en \u00e9tait une d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des sexes. Selon lui, il s'agissait plut\u00f4t [traduction] simplement d'une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale que seules les femmes peuvent souffrir d'une obstruction des trompes de Fallope. \u00c0 son avis, la politique des FC pr\u00e9voyant le financement de la FIV pour les militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin avait pour [traduction] seul but d'apporter une solution \u00e0 ce probl\u00e8me.\n[33] Pendant l'examen du grief de M. Buffett par les diff\u00e9rentes instances, un changement important est survenu concernant la politique des FC en mati\u00e8re de soins de sant\u00e9. Jusqu'en d\u00e9cembre 1998, la seule fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9terminer si un acte m\u00e9dical \u00e9tait assur\u00e9 par le r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 des FC \u00e9tait de consulter les nombreux messages envoy\u00e9s par le Quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la D\u00e9fense nationale, comme celui transmis en septembre 1997 concernant la FIV. Certains m\u00e9decins militaires avaient commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 classer les messages dans des relieurs afin qu'il leur soit plus facile de prendre ces d\u00e9cisions. Pour que leurs membres comprennent mieux l'\u00e9tendue de la protection \u00e0 laquelle ils avaient droit, les FC ont publi\u00e9, le 21 d\u00e9cembre 1998, un document intitul\u00e9 Gamme de soins garantis par les Forces canadiennes (la Gamme de soins) qui, essentiellement, regroupait dans un seul document les diff\u00e9rents messages et d\u00e9cisions envoy\u00e9s au fil des ans relativement aux services de sant\u00e9.\n[34] Les FC ont profit\u00e9 de la publication de la Gamme de soins pour clarifier certaines ambigu\u00eft\u00e9s concernant les services assur\u00e9s. La Bg\u00e9n Jaegar a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que le message diffus\u00e9 par le Quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la D\u00e9fense nationale en septembre 1997, \u00e9non\u00e7ant les restrictions relatives au financement des traitements de FIV, \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre ambigu. La Gamme de soins mentionnait alors express\u00e9ment ce qui suit concernant les traitements de FIV :\nles traitements de FIV n'\u00e9taient assur\u00e9s que si l'infertilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 une obstruction des trompes de Fallope; le traitement \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 pendant trois cycles au maximum; le traitement \u00e9tait offert uniquement aux militaires en service actif et non aux personnes \u00e0 leur charge, \u00e0 leur conjoint ou \u00e0 leur partenaire.\nCes conditions n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es dans le message de septembre 1997. La Bg\u00e9n Jaegar s'est cependant empress\u00e9e d'ajouter dans son t\u00e9moignage que, m\u00eame si ces renseignements ne figuraient peut-\u00eatre pas dans le message original, l'un des aspects de la politique a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 clair : selon l'article 34 des ORFC, seuls les membres en service actif ont droit aux avantages en mati\u00e8re de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC. Elle a soulign\u00e9 qu'il s'agit d'une ordonnance \u00e9manant du niveau le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 (c.-\u00e0-d. les ORFC), qui [traduction] l'emporte sur toutes les autres.\n[35] En juin 2000, le grief de M. Buffett a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 au Comit\u00e9 des griefs des Forces canadiennes (CGFC) afin que celui-ci l'examine et transmette ses conclusions et ses recommandations au chef d'\u00e9tat-major de la D\u00e9fense, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 7.12 des ORFC. Le CGFC a fait conna\u00eetre ses conclusions et recommandations le 4 avril 2001. Il a recommand\u00e9 que le grief soit rejet\u00e9, faisant remarquer que les personnes \u00e0 charge des membres des FC ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas assur\u00e9es en vertu de la politique des FC sur les soins de sant\u00e9 et que la demande de financement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Buffett relativement \u00e0 une FIV avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette politique. Il a conclu que le fait que [traduction] la plupart des membres de groupes autres que ceux indiqu\u00e9s [dans la politique] n'avaient pas droit \u00e0 la protection concernant les traitements de FIV [traduction] pouvait \u00eatre discriminatoire selon la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (la Charte), mais que l'acc\u00e8s limit\u00e9 au financement dans ce domaine constituait une limite raisonnable et justifi\u00e9e au sens de l'article premier de la Charte.\n[36] Le 30 janvier 2002, le chef d'\u00e9tat-major de la D\u00e9fense, le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral R. R. Henault, a fait conna\u00eetre ses conclusions concernant le grief de M. Buffett. Le G\u00e9n Henault a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il souscrivait [traduction] \u00e0 l'essentiel des conclusions du CGFC et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il n'appuyait pas la demande de redressement de M. Buffett.\n[37] Le 23 mai 2002, M. Buffett a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte concernant les droits de la personne dans laquelle il all\u00e9guait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un acte discriminatoire vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi. Il a modifi\u00e9 sa plainte le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2004 pour ajouter l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle les FC avaient appliqu\u00e9 une politique discriminatoire au sens de l'article 10 de la Loi.\nII. ANALYSE A. Comment M. Buffett doit-il faire la preuve de la discrimination? [38] En mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qu'il y a discrimination. La preuve prima facie de discrimination est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9 (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28 (O'Malley)). En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission et le plaignant doivent \u00e9tablir :\nsoit que, en refusant de payer le traitement de FIV, les FC ont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 M. Buffett en cours d'emploi pour un motif de distinction illicite (article 7); soit que, en refusant de payer ce traitement, les FC ont fix\u00e9 ou appliqu\u00e9 des lignes de conduite susceptibles d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement de M. Buffett ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, pour un motif de distinction illicite (article 10).\nPour l'application de la Loi, les membres des FC sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00eatre employ\u00e9s par la Couronne (article 64).\n[39] Une fois que la preuve prima facie de discrimination est \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication raisonnable de l'acte discriminatoire (Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au paragraphe 18). La conduite d'un employeur ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme discriminatoire s'il peut d\u00e9montrer que les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (EPJ) (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi). Pour qu'un acte soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une EPJ, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la personne ou de la cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\nB. A-t-on \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie qu'il y a discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe suivant l'article 7 de la Loi? (i) La th\u00e8se de M. Buffett et de la Commission [40] Selon M. Buffett et la Commission, il ne fait aucun doute que le r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC d\u00e9favorise, en raison de leur sexe, M. Buffett et les autres militaires de sexe masculin qui sont infertiles. Dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime, les traitements de FIV sont assur\u00e9s pour les militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin qui souffrent d'une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope, une forme d'infertilit\u00e9 qui ne touche que les femmes. Par contre, le r\u00e9gime n'offre aucune protection \u00e0 M. Buffett, un militaire de sexe masculin souffrant d'infertilit\u00e9.\n[41] La Commission et M. Buffett soutiennent que les services m\u00e9dicaux assur\u00e9s par le r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 des FC constituent, pour les membres des FC, un avantage qui doit \u00eatre offert \u00e0 tous les militaires d'une mani\u00e8re non discriminatoire et v\u00e9ritablement \u00e9gale. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l'a affirm\u00e9 dans Brooks c. Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1219, au paragraphe 34, d\u00e8s qu'un employeur d\u00e9cide de fournir un r\u00e9gime d'avantages sociaux \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s, il ne peut pas faire d'exclusions de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire.\n(ii) La th\u00e8se des FC [42] Les FC soutiennent de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 que l'avantage en question est, en fait, offert \u00e0 leurs membres de fa\u00e7on non discriminatoire. Comme les militaires sont exclus des r\u00e9gimes de soins de sant\u00e9 provinciaux et territoriaux, les FC ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 leur propre programme de soins de sant\u00e9 financ\u00e9 par des fonds publics \u00e0 l'intention de leurs membres uniquement, non de leur famille. Les FC n'ont pas le mandat, en vertu de la loi, d'offrir une protection m\u00e9dicale aux personnes qui ne font pas partie des FC et, aux termes de l'article 34.23 des ORFC, des soins de sant\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre prodigu\u00e9s \u00e0 des personnes \u00e0 charge (conjoint et enfants), mais seulement dans des circonstances exceptionnelles, par exemple en cas d'urgence ou dans des r\u00e9gions \u00e9loign\u00e9es. Ces services sont ensuite factur\u00e9s aux r\u00e9gimes de soins de sant\u00e9 provinciaux ou territoriaux de la personne \u00e0 charge. Ces services ne sont donc pas r\u00e9ellement financ\u00e9s par les FC.\n[43] Les FC soulignent que la FIV et la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS sont des techniques m\u00e9dicales qui permettent \u00e0 une femme de tomber enceinte. \u00c0 part le sperme fourni par le partenaire masculin, la technique ne touche que la femme. L'OHIP (le seul r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 provincial qui finance l'intervention) facture le traitement au num\u00e9ro d'assurance-maladie de la femme et non pas \u00e0 celui de son partenaire masculin. En l'esp\u00e8ce, lorsqu'il est devenu \u00e9vident que la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS constituait la prochaine solution de rechange qui s'offrait au couple, l'urologue de M. Buffett, le docteur Nigro, a cess\u00e9 de s'occuper de l'affaire. Il a plut\u00f4t conseill\u00e9 au couple de consulter l'endocrinologue sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en m\u00e9decine de la reproduction de Mme Buffett pour savoir si la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS constituait une solution envisageable. M. Buffett a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que, m\u00eame s'il a accompagn\u00e9 sa femme chez son endocrinologue, il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 le patient de ce m\u00e9decin.\n[44] Le docteur Leader a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a l'habitude de rencontrer les deux partenaires avant de commencer les traitements. Il a besoin de savoir si le partenaire masculin souffre d'allergies. Il doit \u00e9galement soumettre le sperme de l'homme \u00e0 des tests. Ce sperme pourrait \u00eatre infect\u00e9, auquel cas il devrait prescrire un traitement avant d'aller plus loin. Le docteur Leader a parl\u00e9 de l'infertilit\u00e9 comme d'un [traduction] probl\u00e8me de couple. Il a mentionn\u00e9 cependant que, malgr\u00e9 la participation du partenaire masculin, au bout du compte, seul le consentement de la femme est requis avant d'entreprendre les traitements.\n[45] En cons\u00e9quence, les FC font valoir que la preuve est claire : la FIV, avec ou sans IICS, est un service m\u00e9dical qui est re\u00e7u exclusivement par une femme. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la femme qui recevrait le service m\u00e9dical demand\u00e9 par M. Buffett est sa femme, laquelle n'est pas un membre des FC. \u00c0 ce titre, elle n'est pas admissible \u00e0 la protection offerte par le programme de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC. La distinction touchant la fourniture des services m\u00e9dicaux est fond\u00e9e sur la question de savoir si le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est un militaire ou non, et non sur le sexe de celui-ci.\n(iii) Analyse comparative [46] Les FC soutiennent qu'il faut effectuer une analyse comparative pour savoir si un acte discriminatoire vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. Cette analyse doit faire ressortir une diff\u00e9rence de traitement par rapport \u00e0 un autre groupe pertinent.\n[47] Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que, dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente plainte et compte tenu de la fa\u00e7on dont les all\u00e9gations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es, qu'il est utile de comparer des individus ou des groupes pertinents pour savoir si un traitement diff\u00e9rent et pr\u00e9judiciable a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli prima facie. Comme la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l'a dit dans Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), 2005 CAF 154, aux paragraphes 23 et suivants, le crit\u00e8re juridique applicable \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de discrimination est souple et variera en fonction des faits de chaque cas. En l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Buffett a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les FC l'ont trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des militaires f\u00e9minines qui souffrent d'une forme d'infertilit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, il serait appropri\u00e9 et instructif d'\u00e9tablir une comparaison entre lui et ses coll\u00e8gues f\u00e9minines.\n[48] Il est n\u00e9cessaire de trouver l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de comparaison appropri\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer l'existence d'une diff\u00e9rence de traitement et les motifs de la distinction (McAllister-Windsor c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines) (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. 48, au paragraphe 40 (T.C.D.P.)). Lorsqu'on d\u00e9finit le groupe de comparaison, il faut tenir compte de l'objet du r\u00e9gime qui conf\u00e8re l'avantage en cause (Battlefords and District Co-operative Ltd. c. Gibbs, [1996] 3 R.C.S. 566, au paragraphe 33).\n[49] Les FC font valoir que leur r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 a pour but de fournir des soins m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 leurs membres. Elles estiment que M. Buffett devrait \u00eatre compar\u00e9 aux militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin qui demanderaient des traitements de fertilit\u00e9 pour leur conjoint non militaire, ou alors aux militaires de sexe masculin et de sexe f\u00e9minin qui demandent un traitement pour leur conjoint relativement \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes qui ne sont pas li\u00e9s \u00e0 la fertilit\u00e9. Dans les deux cas, le r\u00e9sultat de la comparaison serait le m\u00eame : le conjoint qui n'est pas membre des FC n'aurait droit en aucun cas de recevoir des FC des services m\u00e9dicaux financ\u00e9s par l'\u00c9tat. Peu importe le sexe du conjoint, la nature du probl\u00e8me ou le type de traitement demand\u00e9, la protection ne s'\u00e9tend pas aux traitements m\u00e9dicaux fournis aux conjoints. M. Buffett n'a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment en vertu du r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 que les autres militaires, hommes ou femmes. La diff\u00e9rence de protection est fond\u00e9e sur l'appartenance aux FC, laquelle n'est pas un motif de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vu par la Loi.\n[50] Les FC soutiennent en outre que, si une distinction est faite entre les hommes et les femmes dans leur r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9, cette distinction est fond\u00e9e uniquement sur les diff\u00e9rences biologiques existant entre les deux sexes. Seules les femmes sont physiquement capables de tomber enceintes. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne peut \u00eatre discriminatoire de verser de l'argent seulement \u00e0 des femmes pour un traitement faisant en sorte qu'elles tombent enceintes. \u00c0 l'inverse, le r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 des FC finance des traitements de fertilit\u00e9 comparables pour les hommes en conformit\u00e9 avec leurs caract\u00e9ristiques physiologiques. Ainsi, le co\u00fbt de l'embolisation de varicoc\u00e8le de M. Buffett, qui aurait pu le rendre fertile, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fray\u00e9 par les FC. Ces derni\u00e8res font valoir en cons\u00e9quence que la limitation concernant le financement de la FIV tient compte d'une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 biologique : seules les femmes peuvent recevoir ce type de traitement et tomber enceintes. La politique n'est donc pas discriminatoire.\n[51] Je ne partage pas cet avis. Selon moi, une distinction peut \u00eatre faite entre les interventions qui pallient l'infertilit\u00e9 et celles qui favorisent ou facilitent la conception. Les premi\u00e8res sont clairement des proc\u00e9dures m\u00e9dicales qui sont appliqu\u00e9es exclusivement \u00e0 la personne en cause, comme, par exemple, une intervention chirurgicale visant \u00e0 reconstruire les trompes de Fallope obstru\u00e9es d'une femme. Selon le docteur Leader, cette proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tait souvent pratiqu\u00e9e dans le pass\u00e9, avant l'apparition des techniques de reproduction avanc\u00e9es. L'embolisation de varicoc\u00e8le que M. Buffett a subie constituerait un autre exemple de ce type de proc\u00e9dures m\u00e9dicales.\n[52] La FIV et l'IICS sont tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rentes, par contre. Ces techniques ne pallient pas l'infertilit\u00e9 d'un homme ou d'une femme. Elles donnent plut\u00f4t \u00e0 un couple la possibilit\u00e9 de concevoir et d'avoir un enfant qui est biologiquement le leur, peu importe que ce soit l'homme ou la femme qui est infertile. Comme le docteur Nigro l'a dit dans son t\u00e9moignage, [traduction] vous n'avez recours \u00e0 la FIV que si vous voulez un enfant. \u00c0 mon avis, les FC ont donn\u00e9 une interpr\u00e9tation trop \u00e9troite aux faits en l'esp\u00e8ce. Elles consid\u00e8rent que, comme presque tous les aspects de la FIV et de la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS touchent la femme, il s'agit de proc\u00e9dures m\u00e9dicales qui ne concernent qu'elle. Or, les FC oublient que les proc\u00e9dures de reproduction assist\u00e9e sont diff\u00e9rentes de toutes les autres proc\u00e9dures m\u00e9dicales, y compris celles palliant l'infertilit\u00e9, en ce sens que, par n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 biologique, il faut la participation de deux personnes.\n[53] La politique de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC est con\u00e7ue de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 la militaire qui souffre d'une forme d'infertilit\u00e9 f\u00e9minine un service financ\u00e9 par des fonds publics qui lui permettra d'avoir un enfant. Physiologiquement, cette proc\u00e9dure ne peut \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e qu'avec la participation d'une personne du sexe oppos\u00e9. Les FC financent le service pour la militaire, m\u00eame si la personne du sexe oppos\u00e9 dont la participation est requise n'est pas un membre des FC. Elles n'offrent toutefois pas le m\u00eame avantage \u00e0 ses membres de sexe masculin souffrant d'infertilit\u00e9, simplement parce que la participation de la personne du sexe oppos\u00e9 qui n'est pas membre des FC est beaucoup plus complexe sur le plan m\u00e9dical. Cependant, la m\u00eame r\u00e9alit\u00e9 physiologique existe : il ne peut y avoir conception qu'avec la participation de deux partenaires.\n[54] Cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est un facteur important de la comparaison qu'il faut faire en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le fait est que la FIV n'est pas simplement une proc\u00e9dure m\u00e9dicale offerte aux militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin. Ces femmes ont une v\u00e9ritable chance d'avoir un enfant. C'est l\u00e0 le but fondamental de cette proc\u00e9dure. \u00c0 mon avis, compte tenu du contexte, la comparaison exige que l'on se demande si les FC offrent le m\u00eame avantage aux militaires de sexe masculin ayant des probl\u00e8mes d'infertilit\u00e9 qu'aux militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin ayant des probl\u00e8mes d'infertilit\u00e9.\n[55] Il ne fait aucun doute que cette question appelle une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative. Il n'est pas important que les FC aient ajout\u00e9 les traitements de FIV \u00e0 leur liste de services m\u00e9dicaux assur\u00e9s pour les militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin qui ont un certain probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical, afin que la protection offerte par leur r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 soit \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 celle d'un r\u00e9gime provincial (l'OHIP en l'occurrence). Compte tenu du v\u00e9ritable but de la politique et de son effet, le r\u00e9sultat est que M. Buffett se voit refuser un avantage dont jouissent les militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin, \u00e0 savoir l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une conception assist\u00e9e par FIV. Le traitement est donc in\u00e9gal.\n[56] Les FC font valoir que, comme M. Buffett ne peut pas b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la proc\u00e9dure normale de FIV, il ne peut pas pr\u00e9tendre avoir fait l'objet d'un traitement in\u00e9gal de leur part. Cette proc\u00e9dure aide les femmes souffrant d'une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope \u00e0 tomber enceinte et \u00e0 avoir des enfants, mais la FIV seule ne serait pour ainsi dire d'aucune aide pour les hommes comme M. Buffett qui souffrent d'une forme d'infertilit\u00e9 grave. Le taux de grossesse dans ces cas ne d\u00e9passe pas 6 p. 100. Le docteur Nigro et le docteur Leader ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que la FIV conventionnelle n'est pas recommand\u00e9e dans ces cas. Par cons\u00e9quent, les FC soutiennent que les militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin qui ont une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope ne jouissent pas d'un avantage qui est injustement refus\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs coll\u00e8gues masculins. Comme ces hommes ne pourraient pas tirer profit de la proc\u00e9dure normale de FIV, ils ne sont, en fait, priv\u00e9s de rien.\n[57] M. Buffett a affirm\u00e9 au Tribunal \u00e0 l'audience qu'il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter qu'un traitement normal de FIV pour lui et pour sa femme soit financ\u00e9, m\u00eame si ce traitement avait peu de chances de r\u00e9ussir. \u00c0 mon avis cependant, cette affirmation ne fait pas progresser l'analyse en l'esp\u00e8ce. M\u00eame si M. Buffett est peut-\u00eatre pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter n'importe quel traitement dans l'espoir d'avoir un enfant, la preuve m\u00e9dicale dont je suis saisie est claire; la FIV ne peut m\u00e9dicalement, \u00e0 elle seule, apporter ce r\u00e9sultat \u00e0 une personne dans son \u00e9tat. Les deux experts ont affirm\u00e9 qu'ils ne recommanderaient pas le traitement dans le cas de M. Buffett. Ce traitement serait vou\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9chec.\n[58] M. Buffett ne pourrait obtenir le r\u00e9sultat qu'il recherche qu'en recourant \u00e0 la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS. Selon les FC, si le co\u00fbt de ces traitements \u00e9tait d\u00e9fray\u00e9, M. Buffett recevrait, dans les faits, un avantage additionnel auquel n'ont pas droit les autres militaires, hommes ou femmes. De plus, il n'y a pas un seul r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 public au Canada qui assure les traitements de FIV combin\u00e9e avec une IICS. Par cons\u00e9quent, si M. Buffett avait gain de cause, il jouirait d'une plus grande couverture que celle \u00e0 laquelle ont droit les militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin.\n[59] Cependant, traitement \u00e9gal ne signifie pas toujours traitement identique (voir Weatherall c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1993] 2 R.C.S. 872). \u00c0 l'occasion, un traitement diff\u00e9rent peut s'av\u00e9rer n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre une v\u00e9ritable \u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les groupes de comparaison. Le t\u00e9moignage du docteur Leader est tr\u00e8s instructif \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que, jusqu'\u00e0 l'apparition de la technique de l'IICS, l'efficacit\u00e9 de la FIV variait consid\u00e9rablement selon que c'\u00e9tait l'homme ou la femme qui \u00e9tait infertile. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'IICS, les taux de grossesse ont \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] normalis\u00e9s \u00e0 environ 30 p. 100 par cycle pour les deux types d'infertilit\u00e9.\n[60] Ainsi, pour que les militaires de sexe masculin re\u00e7oivent un avantage \u00e9gal \u00e0 celui dont jouissent leurs coll\u00e8gues f\u00e9minines souffrant d'une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope, il faudrait qu'ils aient acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS. Je sais \u00e9videmment que l'IICS entra\u00eene des frais additionnels (qui varient entre 1 100 $ et 1 500 $ selon les t\u00e9moins experts). \u00c0 mon avis cependant, il sera pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de prendre ces frais additionnels en consid\u00e9ration lorsque la question de la contrainte excessive sera analys\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'examen des motifs des FC justifiant la politique.\n[61] L'avocate des FC a mentionn\u00e9 dans sa plaidoirie finale que l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui serait cr\u00e9\u00e9e si les militaires de sexe masculin avaient droit \u00e0 des traitements de FIV avec IICS pay\u00e9s par l'\u00c9tat \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 leur fournir un service [traduction] atteignant une norme de qualit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle n'auraient pas droit les militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin. L'ajout de l'IICS \u00e0 leurs traitements de FIV serait profitable aussi pour les femmes puisque l'IICS leur assurerait de tomber enceinte. Avec respect, je n'ai trouv\u00e9 aucune preuve \u00e0 cet effet dans le dossier. Au contraire, le docteur Leader, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul \u00e0 aborder cette question, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l'IICS a pour effet de placer sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 l'infertilit\u00e9 masculine et l'infertilit\u00e9 f\u00e9minine. Il n'a pas affirm\u00e9 que les femmes b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieraient de l'ajout de l'IICS \u00e0 leurs traitements de FIV normale, lorsque le sperme utilis\u00e9 est normal.\n[62] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la Commission et M. Buffett ont produit une preuve qui, \u00e0 mon avis, d\u00e9montre qu'une distinction d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur le sexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite entre M. Buffett et ses coll\u00e8gues f\u00e9minines. La preuve de discrimination a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie prima facie.\nC. Les FC ont-elles une explication raisonnable pour justifier leur acte par ailleurs discriminatoire? [63] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, une fois la preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de donner une explication raisonnable. En l'esp\u00e8ce, les FC doivent d\u00e9montrer que leur refus de conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 M. Buffett l'avantage en mati\u00e8re d'emploi en cause (le financement de la FIV combin\u00e9e avec une IICS) \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une EPJ (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi). \u00c0 cette fin, elles doivent d\u00e9montrer que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Buffett ou de la cat\u00e9gorie de personnes comme lui constitueraient pour elles une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\n[64] La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9labor\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode en trois \u00e9tapes pour d\u00e9terminer si une EPJ a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie (voir Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 (Grismer)). Un intim\u00e9 peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e en \u00e9tablissant selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s :\nqu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail ou des fonctions en cause; qu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime; que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, l'intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il est impossible de composer avec le plaignant ou avec les personnes qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que lui sans subir une contrainte excessive. Il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer qu'il a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d'accommodement.\n(i) Les FC ont-elles adopt\u00e9 leur politique dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail ou des fonctions en cause? [65] Les FC soutiennent que la norme ou la politique en cause en l'esp\u00e8ce est rationnellement li\u00e9e aux buts de la protection m\u00e9dicale offerte dans le cadre de leur r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9. Elles ont modifi\u00e9 leur politique sur les traitements de fertilit\u00e9 pour qu'elle englobe maintenant les traitements de FIV pour les militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin souffrant d'une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope, afin que leurs membres re\u00e7oivent le m\u00eame niveau de soins que les non-militaires assur\u00e9s par des r\u00e9gimes provinciaux, \u00e0 savoir l'OHIP.\n[66] Je reconnais que la politique des FC \u00e9tait rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 son but de remplir son obligation de fournir \u00e0 ses membres des soins de sant\u00e9 pay\u00e9s par l'\u00c9tat d'un niveau \u00e9gal \u00e0 celui des soins de sant\u00e9 assur\u00e9s par les r\u00e9gimes de sant\u00e9 provinciaux du Canada. Le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la d\u00e9fense a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli.\n(ii) Les FC ont-elles adopt\u00e9 leur norme de bonne foi? [67] Je suis convaincu que les FC ont adopt\u00e9 leur politique de bonne foi. Leur intention \u00e9tait d'\u00e9galer le niveau des services de sant\u00e9 assur\u00e9s par le r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 provincial de l'Ontario. La d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise apr\u00e8s qu'un grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par une militaire r\u00e9sidant en Ontario eut \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli. Au lieu de consid\u00e9rer que le grief ne concernait que cette personne, les FC ont choisi de modifier leur politique et d'\u00e9tendre cette d\u00e9cision aux autres militaires. \u00c0 mon avis, ces mesures ont clairement \u00e9t\u00e9 prises de bonne foi. Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la d\u00e9fense a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli.\n(iii) La norme est-elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but des FC de sorte que celles-ci ne peuvent composer avec M. Buffett et les autres militaires de sexe masculin qui sont infertiles sans subir une contrainte excessive? [68] Les FC soutiennent que la modification du niveau de protection aurait des incidences financi\u00e8res [traduction] importantes et se r\u00e9percuterait sur sa capacit\u00e9 d'offrir des services m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 ses membres. Elles affirment que, compte tenu du co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 en cause, le financement des traitements de FIV combin\u00e9e avec une IICS leur imposerait une contrainte excessive.\n[69] La Commodore Margaret Kavanagh est la commandante et la directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des SSFC. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les SSFC re\u00e7oivent leur financement du minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale. Les SSFC ont re\u00e7u une somme de 270 millions de dollars en 2004-2005, dont environ 193 millions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9s aux soins directs aux patients ou \u00e0 la [traduction] prestation de services, ce qui comprendrait les interventions chirurgicales, l'achat de services de sant\u00e9 au secteur priv\u00e9 et l'achat de m\u00e9dicaments. Le reste de la somme a servi \u00e0 d\u00e9frayer les co\u00fbts op\u00e9rationnels comme la formation du personnel, le soutien technologique, la fonction de contr\u00f4leur et d'autres [traduction] frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Le budget de 270 millions de dollars ne comprend cependant pas le co\u00fbt des salaires des professionnels et des autres employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein des SSFC; ce co\u00fbt est compris dans d'autres budgets des FC. Si l'on tient compte de tous les co\u00fbts, le budget total des FC pour ce qui est de la prestation des soins m\u00e9dicaux d\u00e9passe 700 millions de dollars.\n[70] La Cmdre Kavanagh a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, si les SSFC devaient financer les traitements de FIV ou d'autres interventions qui co\u00fbtent [traduction] cher, cela aurait une incidence sur le niveau de services offerts. Elle a signal\u00e9 que les sommes d'argent dont les FC disposent ne sont pas [traduction] in\u00e9puisable et, en cons\u00e9quence, que des choix devront \u00eatre faits quant aux services qui pourraient \u00eatre assur\u00e9s. Il est peu probable que des traitements m\u00e9dicaux soient retir\u00e9s de la liste des services offerts aux militaires, mais la formation des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 pourrait devoir \u00eatre r\u00e9duite. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si le minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale augmentait le financement des SSFC pour tenir compte des co\u00fbts additionnels des traitements de FIV, cela aurait pour cons\u00e9quence que le budget op\u00e9rationnel des FC serait r\u00e9duit.\n[71] Selon les FC, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal montre que le changement demand\u00e9 par la Commission et M. Buffett leur imposerait un co\u00fbt additionnel important, ce qui aurait des r\u00e9percussions directes et n\u00e9fastes sur les services qu'elles sont en mesure de fournir. Des d\u00e9cisions difficiles fond\u00e9es sur les [traduction] restrictions financi\u00e8res qui en r\u00e9sulteraient devraient \u00eatre prises et auraient pour effet de diminuer les sommes d'argent disponibles pour d'autres secteurs. Les FC sont d'avis que ces r\u00e9percussions leur causeraient une contraire excessive.\na) Le t\u00e9moignage du Major Weisgerber [72] Mais quelle preuve les FC ont-elles produite pour d\u00e9montrer l'incidence r\u00e9elle d'un tel financement? Le Major Chris Weisgerber a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour les FC. Jusqu'\u00e0 tout r\u00e9cemment, il travaillait au sein des Services de soins primaires de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des prestations des soins de sant\u00e9 des SSFC. Il a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un rapport d\u00e9montrant les r\u00e9percussions financi\u00e8res du changement de politique qui \u00e9tendrait la protection aux traitements de FIV \u00e0 tous les militaires et \u00e0 leur partenaire [traduction] dans tous les cas. Il a conclu que le co\u00fbt [traduction] initial d'un tel changement pour les FC [traduction] pourrait atteindre 180 millions de dollars.\n[73] Avant de faire ses calculs, le Maj Weisgerber a consult\u00e9 un site web appel\u00e9 myfertility.ca, o\u00f9 il est indiqu\u00e9 que le co\u00fbt d'une FIV en 2003 se situait entre 6 000 et 8 000 $ par cycle, m\u00e9dicaments inclus. De plus, le site indiquait apparemment que l'on estimait que l'infertilit\u00e9 pouvait [traduction] toucher jusqu'\u00e0 15 p. 100 des couples dans l'ensemble.\n[74] Le Maj Weisgerber a utilis\u00e9 ces chiffres pour faire ses calculs. Il a estim\u00e9 \u00e0 50 000 le nombre de personnes admissibles au r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC. Ce nombre devait comprendre les nombreux r\u00e9servistes qui travaillent pour les FC sur une base contractuelle. Le Maj Weisgerber a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'[traduction] il serait tr\u00e8s difficile d'essayer de d\u00e9terminer combien de militaires en uniforme auraient droit \u00e0 des services de fertilit\u00e9 \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9. Selon lui cependant, son estimation est [traduction] raisonnable et prudente.\nLe Maj Weisgerber a ensuite effectu\u00e9 le calcul suivant :\n50 000 militaires admissibles x 15 p. 100 (taux d'infertilit\u00e9) x 24 000 $ (3 cycles de FIV \u00e0 8 000 $\/cycle) = 180 000 000 $.\n[75] Dans son contre-interrogatoire, le Maj Weisgerber a reconnu que son estimation \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le [traduction] pire des sc\u00e9narios. Je rel\u00e8ve plusieurs failles importantes dans son analyse qui, \u00e0 mon avis, font que son rapport est peu utile pour d\u00e9terminer l'incidence qu'un changement de la politique pourrait avoir sur les FC.\n[76] D'abord, on suppose que chaque traitement de FIV n\u00e9cessitera trois cycles. Or, la preuve m\u00e9dicale fournie par les experts \u00e9tablit clairement qu'il est fort possible qu'une femme tombe enceinte d\u00e8s le premier cycle. Le taux moyen de grossesse par cycle de FIV est d'environ 30 p. 100 selon le docteur Leader, ce qui signifie qu'il en co\u00fbtera probablement, par couple, beaucoup moins que le montant de 24 000 $ avanc\u00e9 par le Maj Weisgerber. C'est d'ailleurs ce qu'indique d'une certaine fa\u00e7on un tableau figurant dans son rapport, qui montre les [traduction] honoraires professionnels vers\u00e9s par les FC pour traiter leurs membres de sexe f\u00e9minin qui \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 admissibles aux traitements de FIV conventionnels et qui avaient re\u00e7u des fonds en vertu de la politique en vigueur, entre 2001 et 2005. Le co\u00fbt moyen annuel du traitement de chaque personne semble avoir vari\u00e9 entre 3 375 et 5 738 $. Ces montants sont beaucoup plus bas que ceux utilis\u00e9s par le Maj Weisgerber dans son rapport. Ces chiffres ne comprennent pas le co\u00fbt des m\u00e9dicaments, les frais d'enqu\u00eate accessoires, les frais de d\u00e9placement ou les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 la productivit\u00e9 au travail, mais, dans le cas des conjoints non militaires, une grande partie de ces frais seraient couverts par leur r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 provincial ou par un tiers assureur (p. ex. le RSSFP). Il n'est pas certain que ces frais ou une partie de ceux-ci seraient assum\u00e9s par les FC, et les FC n'ont produit aucune preuve d\u00e9montrant en d\u00e9tail ce que ces frais leur co\u00fbteraient r\u00e9ellement.\n[77] De plus, le Maj Weisgerber a utilis\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es qui ne sont pas contemporaines de la date de l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Il a suppos\u00e9 que le co\u00fbt de chaque cycle d'un traitement FIV en 2003 \u00e9tait de 8 000 $, un montant qu'il a trouv\u00e9 sur Internet. Or, la plainte de M. Buffett a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision des FC de rejeter sa demande de financement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue cinq ans plus t\u00f4t, en 1998. Selon le docteur Leader, le co\u00fbt \u00e9tait d'environ 3 000 $ en 1997.\n[78] En outre, le Maj Weisgerber a suppos\u00e9 dans ses calculs que chaque couple ayant un probl\u00e8me d'infertilit\u00e9 choisira la FIV. Il n'est toutefois pas r\u00e9aliste de penser que toutes les personnes ayant ce probl\u00e8me veulent avoir un enfant, ou un enfant qui leur est biologiquement li\u00e9. Par exemple, les femmes ne sont peut-\u00eatre pas toutes pr\u00eates \u00e0 se soumettre au traitement, m\u00eame si le co\u00fbt de celui-ci est enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9fray\u00e9 par le r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9. La proc\u00e9dure exige de la femme qu'elle s'injecte elle-m\u00eame pendant plusieurs jours des m\u00e9dicaments que le docteur Leader a qualifi\u00e9 de [traduction] tr\u00e8s puissants. Les ovocytes doivent \u00eatre retir\u00e9s de la femme et les embryons doivent \u00eatre plac\u00e9s subs\u00e9quemment dans son ut\u00e9rus \u00e0 l'aide d'un cath\u00e9ter. Le docteur Leader a affirm\u00e9 que le traitement constitue une [traduction] source constante d'\u00e9motions fortes pour la femme. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que la proc\u00e9dure comporte certains risques physiques (p. ex. une trop grande stimulation des ovaires, des h\u00e9morragies et des infections bact\u00e9riennes). La probabilit\u00e9 qu'un probl\u00e8me survienne est plut\u00f4t faible, mais le risque sur le plan \u00e9motionnel pour la patiente peut \u00eatre important. Si elle ne tombe pas enceinte apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre autant investie sur le plan physique et \u00e9motif, cet \u00e9chec peut avoir des effets psychologiques [traduction] extr\u00eamement graves sur elle, selon le docteur Leader. Compte tenu de ces risques et d'autres consid\u00e9rations, il est loin d'\u00eatre certain que toutes les femmes ayant droit au paiement complet de cette proc\u00e9dure par l'\u00c9tat y auront recours.\n[79] De plus, comme le t\u00e9moignage du docteur Nigro et du docteur Leader l'indiquent, il y a plusieurs autres moyens de concevoir un enfant autres que les techniques de reproduction avanc\u00e9es. Par exemple, certains hommes peuvent parvenir \u00e0 r\u00e9gler leurs probl\u00e8mes d'infertilit\u00e9 en subissant une embolisation de varicoc\u00e8le, une proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9j\u00e0 assur\u00e9e par le r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 des FC et les r\u00e9gimes de sant\u00e9 provinciaux. Dans d'autres cas, lorsque le sperme comporte relativement peu d'anomalies, un couple peut concevoir un enfant en ayant recours \u00e0 l'ins\u00e9mination artificielle, dont le co\u00fbt est d\u00e9fray\u00e9 par le r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 des FC et les r\u00e9gimes de sant\u00e9 provinciaux. Le docteur Leader a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que certains probl\u00e8mes de fertilit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s avec des hormones, administr\u00e9es aux hommes et aux femmes, ou m\u00eame par des changements apport\u00e9s aux habitudes de vie, comme la perte de poids, la d\u00e9cision d'arr\u00eater de fumer et l'\u00e9limination de certains risques professionnels.\n[80] Ainsi, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que tous les couples infertiles recourront in\u00e9vitablement \u00e0 la FIV.\n[81] L'estimation du Maj Weisgerber semble \u00e9galement pr\u00e9supposer que chaque couple fera une demande de FIV au cours de la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e suivant la modification de la politique. Cela est hautement improbable. Comme la Cmdre Kavanagh l'a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, ce ne sont pas tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires potentiels qui r\u00e9clament le service auquel ils ont droit d\u00e8s que les SSFC modifient une politique. Elle a ajout\u00e9 avec beaucoup de franchise : [traduction] Je ne devrai pas tout \u00e0 coup d\u00e9penser une somme de 180 millions de dollars si nous modifions cette politique demain. De fait, quand les FC ont modifi\u00e9 leur politique pour ajouter aux services assur\u00e9s les traitements de FIV pour les femmes souffrant d'une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope, toutes les militaires ayant ce probl\u00e8me n'ont pas imm\u00e9diatement demander ces traitements. Le tableau figurant dans le rapport du Maj Weisgerber indique qu'un nombre relativement constant de militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin ont demand\u00e9 ce type de traitements d'ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e. Ainsi, sept femmes ont re\u00e7u des traitements pay\u00e9s au cours de l'exercice 2001-2002, six en 2002-2003, deux en 2003-2004 et sept en 2004-2005.\n[82] En outre, le Maj Weisgerber a suppos\u00e9, aux fins de ses calculs, que la politique serait \u00e9largie pour permettre \u00e0 tous les militaires, hommes et femmes, qui ont de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 concevoir un enfant avec leur partenaire de se faire payer des traitements de FIV. Les femmes ayant des probl\u00e8mes d'infertilit\u00e9 qui ne sont pas attribuables \u00e0 l'obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope seraient \u00e9galement comprises dans la politique \u00e9largie. Dans sa plainte cependant, M. Buffett ne conteste pas l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir des traitements de FIV dans ces circonstances. Il all\u00e8gue seulement que les FC l'ont trait\u00e9 et ont trait\u00e9 les autres hommes qui, comme lui, sont infertiles, d'une mani\u00e8re discriminatoire. C'est la seule raison pour laquelle il demande un redressement.\n[83] Finalement, comme le Maj Weisgerber l'a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage, ses calculs \u00e9taient essentiellement des [traduction] estimations grossi\u00e8res. Il a ajout\u00e9 que, \u00e0 son avis, personne n'est r\u00e9ellement en mesure d'\u00e9valuer les co\u00fbts de mani\u00e8re fiable, compte tenu des variables et de l'impossibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9voir dans quelle mesure le service sera utilis\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le co\u00fbt r\u00e9el de la modification de la politique pourrait \u00eatre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 ou moins \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[84] Le Maj Weisgerber a nuanc\u00e9 ses commentaires en soulignant qu'il n'avait pas, dans son rapport, accord\u00e9 une tr\u00e8s grande importance aux co\u00fbts d\u00e9coulant d'une modification de la politique. Il a plut\u00f4t mis l'accent sur [traduction] certains des autres probl\u00e8mes que causerait l'\u00e9largissement de la politique. Cependant, la plus grande partie du rapport est consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'analyse des [traduction] co\u00fbts financiers directs que les FC devraient supporter. Il est bri\u00e8vement question, ailleurs dans le rapport, des [traduction] autres probl\u00e8mes, au regard de la question des [traduction] co\u00fbts et des r\u00e9percussions indirects. Ces co\u00fbts comprendraient les d\u00e9penses additionnelles qui pourraient d\u00e9couler des services suppl\u00e9mentaires de maternit\u00e9 et de n\u00e9onatalit\u00e9 [traduction] rendus n\u00e9cessaires par le taux de complication \u00e9lev\u00e9 associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la FIV. Le Maj Weisgerber a reconnu cependant que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ce serait un non-militaire qui recevrait les services dans un cas comme celui de M. Buffett, les co\u00fbts seraient support\u00e9s par les r\u00e9gimes de sant\u00e9 provinciaux et territoriaux et non par les FC.\n[85] Il s'est \u00e9galement inqui\u00e9t\u00e9, dans son rapport, du fait que la modification de la politique pourrait inciter des personnes \u00e0 demander aux FC d'assurer d'autres services destin\u00e9s aux couples, comme les services de consultation familiale. Le Maj Weisgerber n'a rien dit de plus sur l'ampleur de ces co\u00fbts additionnels possibles pour les FC.\n[86] Compte tenu de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je ne pense pas que le rapport du Maj Weisgerber donne une indication fiable des co\u00fbts additionnels qui d\u00e9couleraient de la modification de la politique concernant le financement de la FIV par les FC et de l'\u00e9tendue de leurs r\u00e9percussions, dans les circonstances contest\u00e9es par M. Buffett.\nb) Le t\u00e9moignage de la Bg\u00e9n Jaegar [87] La Bg\u00e9n Jaegar, a reconnu, dans son t\u00e9moignage, que les chiffres du Maj Weisgerber illustraient le [traduction] pire des sc\u00e9narios, en ce sens que ce dernier a suppos\u00e9 que toutes les personnes pouvant \u00eatre infertiles demanderaient un traitement de FIV en m\u00eame temps. Elle a donc tent\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des chiffres [traduction] aussi r\u00e9alistes [...] que possible.\n[88] La Bg\u00e9n Jaeger a d'abord relev\u00e9 le nombre de membres des FC ayant moins de 45 ans. Comme les experts m\u00e9dicaux qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 l'ont dit, la FIV n'est pas recommand\u00e9e aux personnes de 45 ans et plus. La Bg\u00e9n Jaeger a ensuite multipli\u00e9 ce nombre par le pourcentage de membres des FC qui \u00e9taient mari\u00e9s, qu'elle fixe \u00e0 environ 67 p. 100. Elle a ensuite multipli\u00e9 le produit obtenu - environ 39 000 personnes - par le [traduction] pourcentage pr\u00e9vu de personnes mari\u00e9es ayant des probl\u00e8mes de fertilit\u00e9. Elle n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage quel pourcentage elle avait utilis\u00e9, mentionnant seulement que celui-ci se situait [traduction] entre 10 et 15 p. 100. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le r\u00e9sultat de ce calcul \u00e9tait de 5 000 personnes, ce qui permet de croire qu'elle a utilis\u00e9 un pourcentage de 13 p. 100.\n[89] Pour poursuivre ses calculs, la Bg\u00e9n Jaeger avait besoin d'une estimation du [traduction] taux d'utilisation probable des traitements de FIV nouvellement assur\u00e9s. Pour d\u00e9terminer ce taux, elle s'est servie des donn\u00e9es concernant le nombre de femmes qui avaient demand\u00e9 une FIV en vertu de la politique actuelle. Au moment o\u00f9 elle a fait ses calculs, elle a estim\u00e9 que, des 9 600 militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin, il y en avait 5 900 qui avaient moins de 45 ans et qui \u00e9taient mari\u00e9es (le taux de mariage \u00e9tant de 67 p. 100). Utilisant un taux d'infertilit\u00e9 [traduction] plut\u00f4t faible (10 p. 100), elle a conclu qu'il y avait environ 600 femmes infertiles dans les FC. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, dans 10 p. 100 de ces cas, le probl\u00e8me d'infertilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope. Elle n'a cependant pas expliqu\u00e9 clairement d'o\u00f9 venait ce chiffre. Elle a dit avoir consult\u00e9 des sites Web sur Internet. C'est donc dire que 10 p. 100 des 600 femmes infertiles (soit 60 personnes) auraient eu droit \u00e0 des traitements de FIV en vertu de la Gamme de soins actuelle des FC.\n[90] Les chiffres r\u00e9els du Maj Weisgerber r\u00e9v\u00e8lent cependant que, du milieu de 2001 au milieu de 2005, seulement 24 femmes ont demand\u00e9 des traitements de FIV, soit une moyenne de six par ann\u00e9e, ce qui signifie que seulement 10 p. 100 des femmes admissibles ont demand\u00e9 le traitement chaque ann\u00e9e.\n[91] La Bg\u00e9n Jaegar a donc appliqu\u00e9 ce pourcentage de 10 p. 100 au nombre de militaires admissibles, hommes et femmes, qui auraient droit au traitement de FIV pour eux-m\u00eames ou pour leur partenaire si la politique \u00e9tait \u00e9largie (5 000 personnes admissibles x 10 p. 100 = 500 personnes). Elle a ensuite multipli\u00e9 ce chiffre par 24 000 $ (les trois cycles du traitement de FIV x 8 000 $). Le co\u00fbt annuel total que devraient supporter les FC si la politique sur la FIV \u00e9tait \u00e9largie serait donc de 12 millions de dollars, que la Bg\u00e9n Jaeger a choisi de ramener \u00e0 10 millions de dollars pour tenir compte du fait que ses chiffres \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s [traduction] approximatifs.\n[92] Ce chiffre est peut-\u00eatre plus [traduction] r\u00e9aliste que celui avanc\u00e9 par le Maj Weisgerber, il n'en reste pas moins que des erreurs importantes sont r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es dans les calculs de la Bg\u00e9n Jaegar. Ainsi, elle s'est fond\u00e9e sur le co\u00fbt estimatif de 8 000 $ par cycle, soit le co\u00fbt tel qu'il \u00e9tait en 2003, soit cinq ans apr\u00e8s que M. Buffett eut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de financement. Elle a \u00e9galement suppos\u00e9, comme le Maj Weisgerber, que trois traitements de FIV seraient n\u00e9cessaires dans tous les cas. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, trois traitements ne sont pas toujours n\u00e9cessaires et les statistiques concernant les traitements de FIV financ\u00e9s dans le pass\u00e9 par les FC montrent que le co\u00fbt moyen par militaire trait\u00e9 \u00e9tait d'environ 4 800 $, ce qui correspond \u00e0 20 p. 100 du montant de 24 000 $ utilis\u00e9 dans les calculs de la Bg\u00e9n Jaeger. Si l'on appliquait le m\u00eame pourcentage au co\u00fbt total estim\u00e9 par cette derni\u00e8re, le co\u00fbt annuel d\u00e9coulant de la modification de la politique concernant les traitements de FIV serait d'environ deux millions de dollars.\n[93] Il est vrai que les calculs de la Bg\u00e9n Jaegar ne tiennent pas compte du co\u00fbt additionnel de l'IICS, lequel, selon les t\u00e9moignages du docteur Nigro et du docteur Leader, peut atteindre 1 500 $ par cycle. Toutefois, m\u00eame si l'on adoptait le raisonnement de la Bg\u00e9n Jaegar et que l'on supposait que chacune des 500 personnes susceptibles de demander la protection chaque ann\u00e9e avait besoin de trois cycles, le co\u00fbt de l'IICS serait de 2,5 millions de dollars, lequel s'ajouterait au co\u00fbt des traitements de FIV de 10 millions de dollars. Je crois cependant que ce montant est exag\u00e9r\u00e9. Au risque de me r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, il est peu probable que trois traitements soient n\u00e9cessaires dans tous les cas. En outre, une IICS ne sera pas n\u00e9cessairement pratiqu\u00e9e dans tous les cas. La Bg\u00e9n Jaegar a fond\u00e9 ses calculs sur la m\u00eame hypoth\u00e8se que le Maj Weisgerber : la politique des soins de sant\u00e9 serait \u00e9largie pour tous les membres des FC, hommes et femmes. En vertu de cette nouvelle politique, des militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin souffrant d'une forme d'infertilit\u00e9 qui ne leur donnait pas droit \u00e0 des traitements de FIV financ\u00e9s en vertu de la politique actuelle, pourraient dor\u00e9navant demander de tels traitements. Une IICS ne sera pas requise dans ces cas. Selon le t\u00e9moignage des experts m\u00e9dicaux en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'IICS n'est utilis\u00e9e que pour compl\u00e9ter la FIV conventionnelle lorsque le partenaire masculin souffre d'un probl\u00e8me d'infertilit\u00e9 grave.\n[94] En outre, tout comme le Maj Weisgerber, la Bg\u00e9n Jaegar semble placer toutes les formes d'infertilit\u00e9 dans une seule cat\u00e9gorie, pour laquelle on choisira toujours la FIV. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9 cependant, il peut y avoir des cas o\u00f9 un membre des FC admissible \u00e0 des traitements de FIV en vertu de la nouvelle politique choisira une autre solution. Aussi, le nombre annuel de demandes pourrait \u00eatre inf\u00e9rieur aux 500 estim\u00e9es.\n[95] Par cons\u00e9quent, je consid\u00e8re que les estimations de co\u00fbt fond\u00e9es sur les chiffres du Maj Weisgerber ou sur ceux de la Bg\u00e9n Jaeger ne sont pas fiables.\nc) Le co\u00fbt additionnel constituera-t-il une contrainte excessive? [96] Comme je viens tout juste de le mentionner, je suis d'avis que les estimations effectu\u00e9es par le Maj Weisgerber et la Bg\u00e9n Jaegar relativement aux co\u00fbts additionnels aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 l'\u00e9largissement de la politique de fa\u00e7on que la FIV soit assur\u00e9e dans les cas comme celui de M. Buffet et d'autres personnes comme lui ne sont pas fiables et sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9es. Toutefois, m\u00eame si les chiffres plus prudents utilis\u00e9s par la Bg\u00e9n Jaegar \u00e9taient aussi [traduction] r\u00e9alistes qu'elle le pr\u00e9tend, est-il d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il serait impossible d'\u00e9largir la politique \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant et des autres personnes comme lui sans imposer une contrainte excessive aux FC?\n[97] Les SSFC ont consacr\u00e9 193 millions de dollars aux soins directs aux patients en 2004-2005. De ce montant, 15 millions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pens\u00e9s pour tous les services de sant\u00e9 mentale, deux millions pour les soins orthop\u00e9diques et 22 millions pour tous les m\u00e9dicaments. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces sommes, le co\u00fbt de 10 millions de dollars qui, selon l'estimation de la Bg\u00e9n Jaeger, r\u00e9sulterait de l'\u00e9largissement de la protection concernant la FIV, auquel s'ajouterait une somme de 2,25 millions de dollars pour les traitements d'IICS, semble plut\u00f4t important. Les FC ont pr\u00e9tendu que cette d\u00e9pense additionnelle aurait une incidence directe et pr\u00e9judiciable sur les services qu'elles seraient en mesure de fournir.\n[98] Mais serait-il impossible, pour les FC, d'absorber ce co\u00fbt additionnel sans subir de contrainte excessive? La Cmdre Kavanagh a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, bien que les consid\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res soient prises en compte lorsque vient le temps de d\u00e9cider si un service m\u00e9dical doit \u00eatre assur\u00e9, il ne s'agit pas du [traduction] facteur principal. Le bien-\u00eatre et les besoins en mati\u00e8re de soins de sant\u00e9 des militaires sont les facteurs les plus importants. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 que son budget avait augment\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re importante mais constante au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, \u00e0 un taux de 5 \u00e0 6 p. 100 par ann\u00e9e, ce qui correspond \u00e0 l'inflation dans le domaine des soins de sant\u00e9. Les SSFC sont parvenus \u00e0 obtenir des fonds additionnels pour supporter l'augmentation de leurs frais parce que, selon la Cmdre Kavanagh, [traduction] nous avons d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'organisation que nous avions besoin de plus d'argent.\n[99] La preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas l'effet que l'augmentation des co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9largissement de la politique concernant la FIV aurait sur le budget global des FC. Aucune preuve claire du budget total ant\u00e9rieur ou actuel des FC n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite. La Cmdre Kavanagh a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle ignorait le [traduction] montant exact, mais qu'il s'agissait de [traduction] milliards. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de confirmer que la somme de 270 millions de dollars allou\u00e9e aux SSFC repr\u00e9sente [traduction] moins de 10 p. 100 du budget total des FC. Plus important encore, les FC n'ont produit aucune preuve concernant leur financement ou leurs budgets \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la demande de financement de M. Buffett a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en 1998, et il est impossible d'\u00e9valuer de mani\u00e8re fiable les incidences des co\u00fbts additionnels qui auraient d\u00e9coul\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'\u00e9largissement de la politique.\n[100] \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve n'\u00e9tablit pas qu'il est impossible pour les FC de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de M. Buffet et des autres militaires de sexe masculin poss\u00e9dant les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques sans subir de contrainte excessive. La Bg\u00e9n. Jaegar a qualifi\u00e9 les co\u00fbts annuels additionnels qu'elle a estim\u00e9s \u00e0 10 millions de dollars - une somme que je consid\u00e8re exag\u00e9r\u00e9e - de [traduction] non n\u00e9gligeables, comparativement aux sommes que les SSFC consacrent aux autres formes de services. Cela est peut-\u00eatre exact, mais il incombait aux FC de prouver que le co\u00fbt additionnel serait tellement \u00e9lev\u00e9 qu'il leur imposerait une contrainte excessive. Or, les FC ne l'ont pas fait.\n[101] Pour tous ces motifs, j'estime que le refus des FC d'accorder \u00e0 M. Buffett des fonds pour une FIV l'a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi \u00e0 cause de son sexe. La plainte de M. Buffett est fond\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nD. A-t-on fait la preuve d'un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience, vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 7? [102] Les FC n'ont pas contest\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention de M. Buffett voulant que son infertilit\u00e9 constitue une d\u00e9ficience.\n[103] Dans Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville) et Boisbriand (Ville), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665, la Cour supr\u00eame a mentionn\u00e9, au paragraphe 79, qu'un handicap ou une d\u00e9ficience, au sens de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, peut r\u00e9sulter aussi bien d'une limitation physique que d'une affection, d'une construction sociale, d'une perception de limitation ou d'une combinaison de tous ces facteurs.\n[104] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le docteur Leader a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le d\u00e9sir d'avoir des enfants est [traduction] inscrit dans le patrimoine g\u00e9n\u00e9tique de la majorit\u00e9 des gens. L'infertilit\u00e9 les emp\u00eache de satisfaire ce besoin. \u00c0 son avis, le traitement de l'infertilit\u00e9 est une composante n\u00e9cessaire des soins de sant\u00e9 et l'impossibilit\u00e9 de concevoir un enfant a un impact psychologique important autant sur le partenaire masculin que sur le partenaire f\u00e9minin. M. Buffett a d'ailleurs expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que son probl\u00e8me d'infertilit\u00e9 les affecte tellement, lui et sa femme, qu'ils \u00e9vitent d'avoir des rapports avec des coll\u00e8gues et des amis ayant des enfants. Lors de son contre-interrogatoire, le docteur Leader a convenu que l'infertilit\u00e9 est une maladie et une d\u00e9ficience, ajoutant que l'Organisation mondiale de la sant\u00e9 la d\u00e9finit ainsi.\n[105] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je suis convaincu que l'infertilit\u00e9 de M. Buffett constitue une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[106] Le raisonnement menant \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il y a discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe en l'esp\u00e8ce peut s'appliquer \u00e9galement \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. La politique des FC a pour effet de conf\u00e9rer un avantage en cours d'emploi (le financement de la FIV) aux membres des FC atteints d'une certaine forme de d\u00e9ficience (l'obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope) et de priver de cet avantage les militaires qui souffrent d'une forme diff\u00e9rente d'infertilit\u00e9 (l'infertilit\u00e9 masculine). La question qu'il faut se poser dans ce contexte n'est pas tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente de celle qu'il faut se poser dans le cadre de l'analyse de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe : les FC offrent-elles le m\u00eame avantage \u00e0 ses membres souffrant d'une forme d'infertilit\u00e9 masculine qu'\u00e0 ses membres dont l'infertilit\u00e9 est attribuable \u00e0 une autre d\u00e9ficience (l'obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope)?\n[107] Il faut \u00e9galement r\u00e9pondre par la n\u00e9gative \u00e0 cette question. Une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable entre des personnes ayant des formes diff\u00e9rentes de d\u00e9ficience a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie prima facie. Les arguments invoqu\u00e9s par les FC pour expliquer de mani\u00e8re raisonnable et non discriminatoire une telle conclusion ne sont pas diff\u00e9rents de ceux invoqu\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Aucune diff\u00e9rence ne doit \u00eatre faite entre les deux motifs de distinction en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la contrainte excessive que les FC affirment qu'elles subiraient si elles devaient \u00e9largir leur politique de financement des traitements de FIV. En fait, les FC se sont fond\u00e9es sur la m\u00eame preuve et sur les m\u00eames arguments pour ce qui est de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience que pour ce qui est de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[108] La d\u00e9fense des FC peut donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on dans les deux cas et mes conclusions sont les m\u00eames dans les deux cas. Je rel\u00e8ve dans les deux cas les m\u00eames faiblesses quant aux estimations du co\u00fbt de l'\u00e9largissement de la politique et ma conclusion est la m\u00eame : toutes d\u00e9penses additionnelles li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9largissement de la politique de financement de la FIV ne seraient pas \u00e9lev\u00e9es au point de constituer une contrainte excessive pour les FC.\n[109] Je conclus par cons\u00e9quent que le refus des FC de verser des fonds \u00e0 M. Buffett pour des traitements de FIV l'a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de sa d\u00e9ficience. La plainte de M. Buffett est fond\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9galement.\nE. L'all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille [110] La Commission et M. Buffett n'ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience aucun argument solide concernant ce pr\u00e9tendu motif de distinction, l'avocat de la Commission se contentant d'affirmer, dans sa plaidoirie finale, que la politique de financement de la FIV cr\u00e9ait, [traduction] dans une certaine mesure, de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. On ne m'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tayant cette all\u00e9gation ou s'y rapportant, et il serait contraire \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la justice naturelle que j'essaie de formuler des arguments au soutien de cet aspect de la plainte et que je tire des conclusions en cons\u00e9quence. L'all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nF. La plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 10 [111] Compte tenu des mes conclusions concernant la plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 7, je ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si la politique des FC sur laquelle repose la d\u00e9cision de ne pas financer le traitement de FIV contrevenait \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'article 10. La preuve produite en l'esp\u00e8ce m'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure qu'il y a discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'article 7. Lorsqu'il juge une plainte fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal peut ordonner des mesures de redressement, notamment toutes celles demand\u00e9es par la CCDP et M. Buffett en l'esp\u00e8ce, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 53 de la Loi. L'une des mesures demand\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce, la modification de la politique des FC concernant le financement de la FIV, peut \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e, que la plainte soit fond\u00e9e sur l'article 7 ou sur l'article 10 (voir Moore c. Commission canadienne des grains, 2006 TCDP 38, aux paragraphes 5 et 7 \u00e0 10; Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1, aux paragraphes 15 et 16). Je ne vois donc pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'examiner l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10 de la Loi.\n[112] Je mentionne toutefois, en passant, qu'on pourrait se demander si le refus des FC de financer les traitements de FIV peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, aux fins de l'article 10 de la Loi, comme une d\u00e9cision susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement, ou employment opportunities dans la version anglaise de la Loi. Cette question n'a toutefois pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e ou d\u00e9battue par les parties \u00e0 l'audience et, vu mes conclusions expos\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, je ne crois pas devoir me prononcer sur l'article 10.\nG. Quelles mesures de redressement M. Buffett et la Commission demandent-ils? (i) L'octroi de l'avantage en mati\u00e8re d'emploi \u00e0 M. Buffett [113] Aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b), le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 d'accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte discriminatoire l'a priv\u00e9e. Aussi, M. Buffett et la Commission demandent que les FC soient enjointes de financer les traitements de FIV combin\u00e9s avec l'IICS pour lui-m\u00eame et pour sa femme, Rhonda Buffett.\n[114] La preuve des experts m\u00e9dicaux qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce semblaient d\u00e9montrer que les traitements de FIV peuvent ne pas convenir dans tous les cas. L'\u00e2ge de l'homme et de la femme peut \u00eatre un facteur important dans la d\u00e9cision de prescrire ces traitements. En l'esp\u00e8ce, M. et Mme Buffett sont tous deux dans la quarantaine. Par cons\u00e9quent, toute mesure que le Tribunal pourrait ordonner relativement au financement de ces traitements devrait \u00e9videmment \u00eatre conditionnelle aux recommandations et \u00e0 l'opinion du sp\u00e9cialiste de la m\u00e9decine de la reproduction du couple. Si ce sp\u00e9cialiste continue de recommander \u00e0 M. et \u00e0 Mme Buffett la FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS et qu'ils choisissent cette solution, le Tribunal ordonne aux FC de financer les traitements, pour un maximum de trois cycles. Les FC ont l'obligation de conf\u00e9rer des avantages en mati\u00e8re d'emploi \u00e0 leurs employ\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re non discriminatoire et v\u00e9ritablement \u00e9gale. La politique actuelle assure aux femmes souffrant d'une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope un maximum de trois cycles de traitement de FIV. M. Buffet a droit au m\u00eame nombre de cycles de traitement de FIV combin\u00e9e avec l'IICS.\n(ii) Une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral - alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi [115] M. Buffett a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] tr\u00e8s \u00e9prouv\u00e9 par ce qu'il a v\u00e9cu. \u00c9videmment, comme les FC l'ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur expos\u00e9 final, une grande partie de ces \u00e9preuves \u00e9tait attribuable au simple fait que ses probl\u00e8mes d'infertilit\u00e9 les emp\u00eachaient, lui et sa femme, d'avoir des enfants. M. Buffett a d\u00e9crit la peine qu'ils ressentaient lorsqu'ils voyaient la joie que les membres de leur famille ou d'autres personnes autour d'eux partageaient avec leurs enfants, une joie \u00e0 laquelle ils \u00e9taient incapables de participer. Les FC pr\u00e9tendent que, par cons\u00e9quent, le pr\u00e9judice moral de M. Buffet n'est pas li\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs pratiques en mati\u00e8re de financement de la FIV, que j'ai jug\u00e9es discriminatoires, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 sa propre situation personnelle et \u00e0 son propre destin.\n[116] La preuve d'expert semble cependant indiquer que, si les FC avaient accord\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Buffett le financement qu'il a demand\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois en 1998 (alors que lui et sa femme \u00e9taient dans la trentaine), il est fort possible qu'ils auraient eu des enfants il y a des ann\u00e9es. Le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'il continue de subir aurait cess\u00e9 si lui et sa femme avaient subi le traitement avec succ\u00e8s. \u00c9videmment, il n'est pas certain que les traitements auraient men\u00e9 \u00e0 la naissance d'un enfant, mais la possibilit\u00e9 existe tout de m\u00eame.\n[117] \u00c0 mon avis, M. Buffett a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qui aurait pu cesser si les FC ne lui avaient pas refus\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re discriminatoire le financement qu'il demandait.\n[118] De plus, M. Buffet a parl\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage des hauts et des bas qu'il a v\u00e9cus sur le plan \u00e9motif \u00e0 cause des d\u00e9cisions et des avis contradictoires des diff\u00e9rentes instances jusqu'au chef d'\u00e9tat-major qui ont examin\u00e9 son grief. La joie qu'il ressentait lorsqu'il apprenait qu'un officier sup\u00e9rieur l'appuyait \u00e9tait ensuite remplac\u00e9e par une profonde tristesse quand un autre officier rejetait sa demande.\n[119] Compte tenu de l'ensemble de ces circonstances, j'ordonne aux FC de verser \u00e0 M. Buffett une somme de 7 500 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'il a souffert.\niii) Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [120] Des int\u00e9r\u00eats sont payables sur l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce (paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont calcul\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et courent \u00e0 compter de la date du grief de M. Buffet, soit le 10 novembre 1998.\n(iv) La cessation de l'acte discriminatoire [121] La Commission et M. Buffett ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d'ordonner aux FC de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire et de prendre des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables. La Commission semblait laisser entendre que les FC devraient \u00eatre tenues de modifier leur politique de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 financer les traitements de FIV de tous leurs membres.\n[122] \u00c0 mon avis, une telle mesure serait inappropri\u00e9e. Les FC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es coupables de ne pas avoir octroy\u00e9 un avantage en mati\u00e8re d'emploi \u00e0 tous leurs employ\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re non discriminatoire et v\u00e9ritablement \u00e9gale. Il n'appartient pas au Tribunal en l'esp\u00e8ce de d\u00e9cider quels services les FC devraient assurer. Cependant, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les FC maintiennent leur politique de financer les traitements de FIV au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de tous leurs membres qui souffrent d'infertilit\u00e9, elles doivent le faire d'une mani\u00e8re non discriminatoire, en conformit\u00e9 avec les conclusions en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[123] En cons\u00e9quence, j'ordonne aux FC, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a), de prendre des mesures, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, afin de modifier leur politique relative au financement des traitements de FIV de telle sorte que les militaires de sexe masculin souffrant d'infertilit\u00e9 re\u00e7oivent des avantages r\u00e9ellement \u00e9gaux \u00e0 ceux dont jouissent les militaires de sexe f\u00e9minin souffrant d'une obstruction bilat\u00e9rale des trompes de Fallope ou \u00e0 ceux dont jouissent toutes les militaires, selon le cas.\n(v) La formation de sensibilisation [124] La Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d'ordonner que tous les militaires qui sont charg\u00e9s de l'\u00e9laboration et de l'application de la politique en mati\u00e8re de soins de sant\u00e9 des FC re\u00e7oivent une formation de sensibilisation quant aux aspects des droits de la personne qui ont un lien avec les d\u00e9cisions qu'ils prennent. La Commission a fait explicitement allusion \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal d\u00e9montrant que, en aucun temps pendant l'\u00e9laboration de la politique concernant le financement de la FIV ou de la Gamme de soins en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les FC n'ont demand\u00e9 l'avis d'un conseiller juridique. La Commission semblait laisser entendre que les d\u00e9cideurs des FC n'avaient pas tenu compte des incidences juridiques, en particulier en ce qui a trait aux droits de la personne.\n[125] Le pr\u00e9sent diff\u00e9rend aurait peut-\u00eatre pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9 si les FC avaient demand\u00e9 l'avis d'un conseiller juridique avant d'adopter leur politique de financement des traitements de FIV, mais je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il s'agit d'une raison suffisante d'ordonner la formation de sensibilisation demand\u00e9e par la Commission. Il ne fait aucun doute que les pr\u00e9sents motifs de d\u00e9cision permettront aux FC et \u00e0 leur personnel de mieux comprendre les facteurs qui doivent \u00eatre pris en compte dans le cadre de l'application de la politique des soins de sant\u00e9. La demande de la Commission concernant la formation de sensibilisation est rejet\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] L'instruction de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman a commenc\u00e9 le 30 ao\u00fbt 2004. Apr\u00e8s 13 jours d'audience pour la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, des observations finales pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par toutes les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues du 23 f\u00e9vrier au 25 f\u00e9vrier 2005. Les parties ont eu par la suite une p\u00e9riode additionnelle pour traiter par \u00e9crit de certaines questions, \u00e0 savoir de deux d\u00e9cisions judiciaires qui venaient juste d'\u00eatre rendues. M. Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses observations additionnelles le 2 mars 2005 et M. Kulbashian a fait de m\u00eame le 21 mars 2005. La Commission a choisi de ne pas envoyer d'observations additionnelles. Je note que M. Kulbashian a profit\u00e9 de l'occasion pour pr\u00e9senter plusieurs arguments additionnels qui n'avaient pas de liens avec les d\u00e9cisions judiciaires auxquelles il \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 limiter ses commentaires.\n[2] Le Tribunal a par la suite pris l'affaire en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et n'a pas encore rendu sa d\u00e9cision.\n[3] Le 3 janvier 2006, environ dix mois apr\u00e8s que les observations finales eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es de vive voix, M. Kulbashian a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une [traduction] requ\u00eate en vue d'interroger de nouveau un t\u00e9moin, qui \u00e9tait principalement une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vue d'appeler de nouveau \u00e0 la barre M. Warman afin qu'il subisse un contre-interrogatoire par M. Kulbashian (premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate).\n[4] Le 4 janvier 2006, M. Kulbashian a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d'[traduction] exclure la preuve contre Tri-City Skins.com et Affordablespace.com [traduction] de l'\u00e9tape du jugement dans le processus du Tribunal (deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate). Dans cette requ\u00eate, M. Kulbashian pr\u00e9tendait essentiellement que ces deux intim\u00e9s ne sont pas des entit\u00e9s pouvant faire l'objet d'une plainte suivant l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[5] Le 6 janvier 2006, M. Kulbashian a envoy\u00e9 au Tribunal certains renseignements sur M. Warman et sur le t\u00e9moin de la Commission, Terry Wilson, qui consistaient en fait en des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire suppl\u00e9mentaires que M. Kulbashian tentait de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de leurs t\u00e9moignages (troisi\u00e8me requ\u00eate).\n[6] Une autre requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le m\u00eame jour, le 6 janvier 2006 (quatri\u00e8me requ\u00eate), bien que selon moi cette requ\u00eate devrait plus judicieusement \u00eatre d\u00e9crite d'arguments additionnels. Ces arguments mentionnaient que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour traiter des messages Internet qui, selon ce qui \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9, \u00e9taient des messages qui n'\u00e9taient pas express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte ou dans le rapport de l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission.\n[7] Il semble que le Tribunal n'a pas transmis \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 M. Warman des exemplaires des troisi\u00e8me et quatri\u00e8me requ\u00eates, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 la pratique normale dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Je donne au greffe du Tribunal la directive de transmettre sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 M. Warman des exemplaires de ces requ\u00eates.\n[8] Le 19 janvier 2006, M. Kulbashian a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une autre requ\u00eate par laquelle il demandait que la preuve qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lors de l'audience, preuve qui se rapportait \u00e0 une copie du disque dur d'un ordinateur, soit maintenant [traduction] exclue de la pr\u00e9sente instance devant le Tribunal (cinqui\u00e8me requ\u00eate).\n[9] Le 20 janvier 2006, la Commission et M. Warman ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs observations en r\u00e9ponse aux deux premi\u00e8res requ\u00eates de M. Kulbashian (dat\u00e9es du 3 et du 4 janvier 2006). Dans ses observations, la Commission se plaignait de la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle M. Kulbashian avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 quant \u00e0 ses requ\u00eates. La Commission pr\u00e9tend que ces d\u00e9p\u00f4ts successifs de requ\u00eates, qui d'une certaine fa\u00e7on se r\u00e9p\u00e8tent les unes les autres, constituent un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Juste au moment o\u00f9 l'avocat de la Commission se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 traiter d'une requ\u00eate, une autre requ\u00eate \u00e9tait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. La Commission demande au Tribunal de statuer sur les deux premi\u00e8res requ\u00eates avant de l'obliger \u00e0 consacrer des efforts additionnels \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des requ\u00eates subs\u00e9quentes.\n[10] Le 23 janvier 2006, M. Kulbashian a encore d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une autre requ\u00eate, demandant cette fois au Tribunal d'[traduction] exclure de l'\u00e9tape du jugement dans le processus du Tribunal la preuve contre l'intim\u00e9 C.E.C.T. (sixi\u00e8me requ\u00eate). Les observations figurant dans cette requ\u00eate ressemblent \u00e0 celles figurant dans la requ\u00eate de M. Kulbashian pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment le 4 janvier 2006.\n[11] Je partage l'opinion de la Commission. M. Kulbashian a effectivement [traduction] inond\u00e9 les autres parties d'une pluie de requ\u00eates, au moment o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision quant au bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte \u00e9tait sur le point d'\u00eatre rendue. \u00c0 mon avis, la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal est mieux servie si le Tribunal rend imm\u00e9diatement ses d\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 toutes les requ\u00eates. Je n'estime pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire d'entendre d'autres observations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des requ\u00eates de M. Kulbashian.\nLa premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate [12] Dans l'affaire Vermette c. CBC (1994), 28 C.H.R.R. D\/89 (T.C.D.P.), confirm\u00e9e par (1996) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/139 (C.F. 1re inst.), le Tribunal a trait\u00e9 de la question de la r\u00e9ouverture d'une instance afin de fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels. Se fondant sur le trait\u00e9 The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases, de Sopinka et Lederman, le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 que, sauf en cas de fraude ou de surprise, la preuve qu'une partie tente de pr\u00e9senter doit \u00eatre une preuve nouvellement d\u00e9couverte et une preuve qui, avec une diligence raisonnable, n'aurait pas pu \u00eatre d\u00e9couverte au cours de l'instruction. Il doit \u00e9galement s'agir d'une preuve telle qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur d\u00e9terminant quant au r\u00e9sultat. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu qu'il existe un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire plus large dans les cas o\u00f9 la demande en r\u00e9ouverture est re\u00e7ue avant que soit rendue la d\u00e9cision.\n[13] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, M. Kulbashian ne tente pas de fournir une preuve nouvellement d\u00e9couverte comme il a lui-m\u00eame reconnu \u00e0 la page 2 de sa requ\u00eate :\n[traduction]\nAu cours de l'audience du Tribunal, le demandeur a tent\u00e9 d'interroger Richard Warman relativement \u00e0 son association avec l'ARA. La Commission et le t\u00e9moin se sont oppos\u00e9s et le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 qu'il n'y aurait pas de contre-interrogatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son association avec l'ARA.\nM. Kulbashian veut maintenant appeler de nouveau M. Warman \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins pour lui faire subir un contre-interrogatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses liens avec le groupe ARA, ce qui en fait est une tentative de pr\u00e9senter de nouveau la m\u00eame preuve. En agissant ainsi, M. Kulbashian demande au Tribunal de revoir sa d\u00e9cision par laquelle il maintient les objections des autres parties \u00e0 cette s\u00e9rie de questions. Je ne vois aucune raison de revoir la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Les intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs observations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces objections lorsqu'ils ont tent\u00e9 de fournir la preuve lors de l'audience. Le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 leurs observations et a rendu une d\u00e9cision. Cette d\u00e9cision est maintenue. La premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate [14] Cette requ\u00eate me semble \u00eatre plus une tentative de pr\u00e9senter des arguments additionnels qu'une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vue d'[traduction] exclure la preuve. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9, c'est que la question \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par les parties au cours de leurs observations finales. Je ne vois rien de fondamentalement nouveau dans l'argumentation que M. Kulbashian a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans sa requ\u00eate. De toute fa\u00e7on, je consid\u00e9rerais toute tentative de plaider de nouveau l'affaire \u00e0 ce moment comme injuste et comme un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[15] Des observations finales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es de vive voix pendant trois jours en f\u00e9vrier 2005. L'argumentation de M. Kulbashian a dur\u00e9 environ une heure la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e, s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e durant toute la deuxi\u00e8me journ\u00e9e et s'est continu\u00e9e pendant cinquante autres minutes la derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e. L'autre intim\u00e9, M. Richardson, a suivi avec sa propre argumentation pendant approximativement une heure et vingt minutes.\n[16] \u00c0 mon avis, M. Kulbashian a eu la possibilit\u00e9 enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter tous ses arguments. En outre, il a profit\u00e9 de l'occasion que le Tribunal offrait \u00e0 toutes les parties de d\u00e9poser par \u00e9crit des observations compl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de certaines d\u00e9cisions judiciaires r\u00e9centes. Plut\u00f4t que de simplement faire des commentaires quant \u00e0 ces d\u00e9cisions, M. Kulbashian a \u00e9crit presque deux pages \u00e0 interligne simple d'observations finales additionnelles, qui n'avaient aucun lien avec les d\u00e9cisions en question. Par contre, M. Warman a respect\u00e9 les directives \u00e9tablies par le Tribunal.\n[17] Il est tr\u00e8s injuste pour les autres parties que M. Kulbashian revienne maintenant, environ dix mois plus tard, et tente de plaider de nouveau sa cause, notamment puisque ces arguments se rapportent \u00e0 des questions qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es ou qui auraient pu raisonnablement \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es au cours des trois jours d'audience pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales. La deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\nLa troisi\u00e8me requ\u00eate [18] En fait, M. Kulbashian n'a pas vraiment d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate. Il a plut\u00f4t envoy\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de documents au Tribunal, demandant qu'ils soient [traduction] pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au membre instructeur du Tribunal qui avait entendu l'affaire. Je vais n\u00e9anmoins traiter de ces documents comme s'il s'agissait d'une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9ouverture de l'affaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vue de fournir de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[19] M. Kulbashian d\u00e9clare dans sa lettre de pr\u00e9sentation que le premier ensemble de documents consiste en certains [traduction] affichages faits par M. Warman dans un [traduction] groupe de discussion de tenants de la supr\u00e9matie blanche, sur Internet. M. Kulbashian pr\u00e9tend que les commentaires sur ces affichages contreviennent \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. M. Kulbashian ne mentionne pas quelle est la pertinence avec la pr\u00e9sente affaire et je n'en vois aucune. En renvoyant aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Vermette, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, je ne vois pas quel facteur d\u00e9terminant cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve aurait quant \u00e0 l'issue de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Comme j'ai rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Kulbashian et \u00e0 M. Richardson de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e au cours de l'audience, l'affaire en litige qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise au Tribunal se rapporte aux actes discriminatoires qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9s par les intim\u00e9s, non par d'autres personnes.\n[20] Le deuxi\u00e8me ensemble de documents joints \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me requ\u00eate se rapporte \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Kulbashian aupr\u00e8s du service de police de New Westminster, qui est l'employeur actuel du t\u00e9moin de la Commission, Terry Wilson. Dans cette plainte, M. Kulbashian fait une s\u00e9rie d'all\u00e9gations contre M. Wilson. Une fois de plus, je ne vois rien de pertinent dans ces documents, en particulier \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'ils ne contiennent aucune conclusion de quelque autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Wilson. Il y a seulement une reconnaissance faite par l'organisme Office of the Police Complaint Commission (bureau de la commission des plaintes contre la police) selon laquelle les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte de M. Kulbashian peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9crites comme des questions en mati\u00e8re de confiance du public. Comme dans le cas du premier ensemble de documents, je ne vois pas comment cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve serait un facteur d\u00e9terminant quant \u00e0 l'issue de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[21] En outre, j'estime qu'il est choquant que M. Kulbashian ait tent\u00e9 dans sa correspondance au Tribunal de d\u00e9poser au dossier des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal lors de l'audience. Rien n'indique que l'un ou l'autre de ces documents ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement communiqu\u00e9 aux autres parties. De plus, il faut mentionner que l'audience tenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente affaire est termin\u00e9e depuis plus de dix mois.\n[22] La troisi\u00e8me requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e. La correspondance originale de M. Kulbashian peut demeurer dans le dossier officiel du Tribunal, mais les documents en question ne seront pas pris en compte dans ma d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive quant \u00e0 l'affaire.\nLa quatri\u00e8me requ\u00eate [23] Tout comme dans la deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate, M. Kulbashian tente de plaider de nouveau sa cause. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 lorsque j'ai trait\u00e9 de la deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate, M. Kulbashian a eu plus que la possibilit\u00e9 enti\u00e8re il y a dix mois de traiter de toutes les questions soumises au Tribunal. Ce serait une injustice envers toutes les parties et un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal que de lui permettre de plaider de nouveau sa cause \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape tardive de l'instruction.\n[24] La quatri\u00e8me requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\nLa cinqui\u00e8me requ\u00eate [25] Cette requ\u00eate est une fois de plus une tentative de faire examiner \u00e0 nouveau la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au cours de l'audience. Cette requ\u00eate ou cette objection aurait pu \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e lorsque les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors de l'audience ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, aurait pu \u00eatre d\u00e9battue dans les observations finales. Ce n'est maintenant pas le temps, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape extr\u00eamement tardive de l'instruction, pour M. Kulbashian de tenter de revenir en arri\u00e8re et de demander que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soient exclus.\n[26] La cinqui\u00e8me requ\u00eate est \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9e.\nLa sixi\u00e8me requ\u00eate [27] Cette requ\u00eate consiste en des arguments additionnels qui ressemblent \u00e9troitement \u00e0 ceux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans la deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate. Pour les motifs d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate, la sixi\u00e8me requ\u00eate est \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9e.\n[28] M. Kulbashian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans des notes en bas de page de ses requ\u00eates que la raison du [traduction] d\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif de ses requ\u00eates \u00e9tait qu'il n'avait pas d'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re juridique. Au cours de tout le processus d'instruction, le Tribunal a tent\u00e9 d'accorder aux deux intim\u00e9s non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de nombreux accommodements compte tenu de leur inexp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re juridique. Cependant, de tels accommodements ne peuvent aller aussi loin que de rendre le processus injuste et pr\u00e9judiciable aux autres parties.\n[29] Compte tenu de mes conclusions selon lesquelles je rejette les six requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par M. Kulbashian, les parties sont lib\u00e9r\u00e9es de l'obligation de d\u00e9poser les observations non encore d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces requ\u00eates, comme le Tribunal avait demand\u00e9 de le faire dans de la correspondance ant\u00e9rieure.\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 dat\u00e9 du 15 juin 2006, la plaignante a fait part de son intention de faire t\u00e9moigner la professeure Patrica Monture comme t\u00e9moin expert dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. Celle-ci t\u00e9moignera quant \u00e0 la discrimination dans le contexte des faits de l'esp\u00e8ce ainsi que dans le contexte de ses recherches et de ses publications.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e s'oppose \u00e0 ce que la plaignante pr\u00e9sente ce t\u00e9moignage.\n[3] La professeure Monture est membre de la facult\u00e9 de sociologie de l'universit\u00e9 de la Saskatchewan. Elle expose le contenu du t\u00e9moignage qu'elle se propose de donner dans un rapport d'expert qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 sous forme d'un affidavit de trois pages. Aux paragraphes 1 \u00e0 3 de cet affidavit, elle explique que son domaine d'\u00e9tude porte principalement sur le droit et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi que sur le droit constitutionnel, notamment sur les droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s, les femmes autochtones et la criminologie. Elle fait \u00e9galement mention de son exp\u00e9rience pertinente dans le domaine.\n[4] J'ai examin\u00e9 l'affidavit et je suis d'accord avec l'intim\u00e9e que le t\u00e9moignage que la professeure Monture se propose de pr\u00e9senter est soit non pertinent, non n\u00e9cessaire pour le Tribunal ou que dans celui-ci la professeure Monture se prononce de mani\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9e sur la question fondamentale. Ce t\u00e9moignage devrait donc \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9.\nT\u00e9moignage non pertinent [5] La Cour supr\u00eame, dans l'arr\u00eat R. c. Mohan [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9, a d\u00e9crit les crit\u00e8res d'admissibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages d'expert. La Cour a soulign\u00e9, au paragraphe 18, que, comme pour toute autre preuve, la pertinence est une exigence liminaire pour l'admission d'une preuve d'expert.\n[6] Selon moi, une partie du t\u00e9moignage de la professeure Monture est manifestement non pertinente, en l'occurrence son opinion, laquelle figure au paragraphe 11 de son affidavit, selon laquelle la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne d\u00e9montre un manque de compr\u00e9hension manifeste de la situation des femmes autochtones, de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique et de l'intersectionalit\u00e9.\n[7] La question en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce consiste \u00e0 savoir si la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e9tablit que l'intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire, et ce, en contravention de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Je ne vois pas en quoi la r\u00e9ponse de la Commission \u00e0 la plainte sera pertinente quant \u00e0 cette question.\nT\u00e9moignage non n\u00e9cessaire [8] Dans l'arr\u00eat Mohan, la Cour d\u00e9clare \u00e9galement, au paragraphe 21, que le r\u00f4le d'un expert est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de fournir au juge et au jury une conclusion toute faite que ces derniers, en raison de la technicit\u00e9 des faits, sont incapables de formuler. La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que si, \u00e0 partir des faits \u00e9tablis par la preuve, un juge ou un jury peut \u00e0 lui seul tirer ses propres conclusions, alors l'opinion de l'expert n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire.\n[9] Aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 10 de son affidavit, la professeure Monture renvoie \u00e0 des ouvrages portant sur la discrimination, puis elle tente de d\u00e9finir les concepts de discrimination individuelle et syst\u00e9mique, de m\u00eame que l'intersectionalit\u00e9 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur de multiples motifs de distinction illicite. Ces concepts sont des questions qui sont r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement abord\u00e9es par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dans le cadre de ses d\u00e9cisions. L'expertise sup\u00e9rieure d'un tribunal des droits de la personne en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation des faits et aux d\u00e9cisions dans un contexte de droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue par les tribunaux (voir p. ex. R c. Mossop, [1993] 1 R.C.S. 554).\n[10] Selon moi, cette partie du t\u00e9moignage que la professeure Monture se propose de pr\u00e9senter rel\u00e8ve clairement de l'exp\u00e9rience et de la connaissance du Tribunal et, par cons\u00e9quent, n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nPreuve sur la question fondamentale [11] Au paragraphe 8 de son affidavit, la professeure Monture affirme que, selon elle, les nombreux incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par la plaignante qui se sont produits alors qu'elle \u00e9tait membre des FC constituent [traduction] des exemples clairs et manifestes de discrimination individuelle. Il s'agit, en fait, de son opinion quant \u00e0 la question fondamentale que le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera en l'esp\u00e8ce, c'est-\u00e0-dire, la question de savoir si la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un acte discriminatoire.\n[12] Comme le Tribunal l'a soulign\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Brooks c. Minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans, 2004 TCDP 20, bien qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 assouplie ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, la r\u00e8gle qui emp\u00eache de fournir une opinion sur le point litigieux dont le tribunal est saisi doit tout de m\u00eame \u00eatre respect\u00e9e. Tout organisme d'arbitrage a l'obligation de tirer ses propres conclusions sur les aspects fondamentaux d'une plainte, sans b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de directives de la part des parties. Selon moi, cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne pour lesquelles le Tribunal poss\u00e8de la comp\u00e9tence susmentionn\u00e9e et est donc capable de tirer les conclusions avanc\u00e9es par la professeure Monture dans son rapport, et ce, sans aucune aide.\nConclusion [13] Pour l'ensemble de ces motifs, le t\u00e9moignage d'expert que la professeure Monture se propose de donner ainsi que son affidavit sont exclus de la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nAthanasios D.

Jensen Date : Le 11 octobre 2006 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2006 TCDP 41\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision concerne le lieu de l\u2019audition de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre www.bcwhitepride.com par le Centre de recherche\u2011action sur les relations raciales (le CRARR). Le CRARR all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9, www.bcwhitepride.com, a diffus\u00e9 de la propagande haineuse sur Internet, ce qui est interdit par l\u2019article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) et le CRARR pr\u00e9tendent que l\u2019audition de la plainte devrait avoir lieu \u00e0 Ottawa ou \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que leurs bureaux sont situ\u00e9s dans ces villes et que leurs deux t\u00e9moins y r\u00e9sident.\n[3] Paul Fromm a pr\u00e9tendu, pour le compte de l\u2019intim\u00e9, que l\u2019audition devrait avoir lieu \u00e0 Penticton, en Colombie\u2011Britannique. Il a fait valoir que la Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate afin que John Beck soit ajout\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. M. Beck a l\u2019intention de contester cette requ\u00eate. Selon M. Fromm, M. Beck n\u2019a pas les moyens financiers d\u2019assister \u00e0 une audience \u00e0 Ottawa ou \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Il ajoute que le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9, Bernard Klatt, habite dans le sud de la r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Okanagan et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9, www.bcwhitepride.com, est ou \u00e9tait apparemment situ\u00e9 en Colombie\u2011Britannique.\n[4] Le Tribunal tient habituellement ses audiences \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e. Il est toutefois difficile dans les cas concernant la pr\u00e9tendue diffusion de propagande haineuse sur Internet de d\u00e9terminer pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment o\u00f9 la discrimination a eu lieu. Le Tribunal s\u2019efforce de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des parties lorsqu\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 de le faire (Warman c. Canadian Heritage Alliance et Melissa Guille, 2006 TCDP 17, au paragraphe 4).\n[5] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il y a, d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, deux parties et deux t\u00e9moins qui aimeraient que l\u2019audition de la plainte ait lieu \u00e0 Ottawa ou \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et, de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, une partie, une partie \u00e9ventuelle et un t\u00e9moin (peut\u2011\u00eatre deux) qui aimeraient qu\u2019elle se d\u00e9roule en Colombie\u2011Britannique. Ainsi, les demandes oppos\u00e9es sont relativement \u00e9quivalentes en termes de nombre. J\u2019estime cependant que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients est favorable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[6] Pour une raison quelconque, John Beck n\u2019\u00e9tait pas nomm\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 avant que la plainte ne soit renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. La Commission a cependant fait savoir qu\u2019elle demanderait au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience qu\u2019il soit ajout\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9. Elle veut que M. Beck se rende \u00e0 Ottawa ou \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al afin de tenter de le faire ajouter aux parties. Cela ne semble pas \u00e9quitable. \u00c0 mon avis, si la Commission veut que M. Beck devienne une partie, elle doit en faire la demande \u00e0 Penticton, en Colombie\u2011Britannique.\n[7] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019au moins un autre t\u00e9moin origine de cette r\u00e9gion de la Colombie\u2011Britannique et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 origine \u00e9galement de cette province, je pense qu\u2019il est logique de tenir l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019audience \u00e0 Penticton. En outre, il est vraisemblable de penser que la Commission et le plaignant seront plus en mesure que l\u2019intim\u00e9 et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9ventuel de supporter les frais d\u2019une audience tenue dans un lieu diff\u00e9rent.\n[8] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne que l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte ait lieu \u00e0 Penticton, en Colombie\u2011Britannique, ou dans un endroit situ\u00e9 aussi pr\u00e8s que possible de cette ville selon les dispositions que le Tribunal pourra prendre.\nSign\u00e9e par\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision portant sur une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) demandant que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, les Forces canadiennes (les FC) de divulguer des documents pour lesquels une immunit\u00e9 de divulgation a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e.\n[2] La requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le contexte d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Micheline Montreuil. Mme Montreuil estime qu'elle est une transgend\u00e9riste. Dans sa plainte, elle pr\u00e9tend que les FC ont agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en raison de son sexe et d'une pr\u00e9tendue d\u00e9ficience lorsqu'elles ont refus\u00e9 de lui permettre de s'enr\u00f4ler dans les Forces en 1999.\n[3] Lors du processus de gestion du cas, les FC ont mentionn\u00e9 qu'elles avaient l'intention de pr\u00e9senter un t\u00e9moignage de m\u00e9decin expert. Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 aux FC de remettre aux parties une copie du rapport de l'expert au plus tard le 24 avril 2006.\n[4] Trois jours avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du rapport, les FC ont demand\u00e9 une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du rapport d'expert. Dans cette demande de prorogation, l'avocat des FC a mentionn\u00e9 que le dossier venait de lui \u00eatre confi\u00e9 et que, lors de discussions tenues avec l'expert, le Dr Pierre Assalian, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la port\u00e9e du rapport devait \u00eatre \u00e9largie. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le Dr Assalian devrait interroger Mme Montreuil.\n[5] Le Tribunal a accueilli la demande de prorogation et la date du 23 juin 2006 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e comme date de production du rapport du Dr Assalian. Le 22 juin 2006, les FC ont transmis aux parties une copie du rapport du Dr Assalian.\n[6] La Commission a demand\u00e9 que, en plus, les FC transmettent les documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par le Dr Assalian ou qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s au Dr Assalian pour la pr\u00e9paration du rapport d'expert. Il s'agissait des documents suivants :\ntous les rapports, complets ou pr\u00e9liminaires, r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par le Dr Pierre Assalian, au 24 avril 2006; toutes les communications, toute la correspondance et (ou) tous les \u00e9changes de quelque nature qu'ils soient, sans exception, entre les Forces canadiennes et le Dr Assalian, qui ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration de l'opinion d'expert; tous les autres documents r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par le Dr Assalian dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[7] L'intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 de fournir les documents demand\u00e9s car, selon elles, ils \u00e9taient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l'immunit\u00e9 de divulgation qui ressort du principe du secret professionnel.\n[8] La Commission a alors d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate devant le Tribunal. Lors de l'audience de la requ\u00eate, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que le Tribunal devrait appliquer les r\u00e8gles de common law qui ont trait au privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation. Selon ces r\u00e8gles, les FC ont renonc\u00e9 au privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation des documents demand\u00e9s lorsqu'elles ont produit le rapport du Dr Assalian et qu'elles ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elles appelleraient ce dernier \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience.\n[9] L'intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu que, selon le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, les FC n'ont pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 leur droit \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents demand\u00e9s lorsqu'elles ont produit le rapport d'expert du Dr Assalian.\n[10] Le paragraphe 50(4) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal ne peut admettre en preuve les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui, dans le droit de la preuve, sont confidentiels devant les tribunaux judiciaires. Nous ne sommes toutefois pas, dans le pr\u00e9sent processus, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape o\u00f9 l'on se penche sur l'admissibilit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Nous sommes \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de la divulgation du processus d'instruction.\n[11] L' alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal exige que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de la divulgation, chaque partie doit indiquer les divers documents qu'elle a en sa possession pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9. La version anglaise stipule que chaque partie doit fournir une liste des documents for which privilege is claimed. Pour bien pr\u00e9ciser, je consid\u00e8re que les termes privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation (en fran\u00e7ais) et privilege (en anglais), tels qu'ils sont employ\u00e9s dans les R\u00e8gles, comprennent le concept de secret professionnel dans le sens qu'il est utilis\u00e9 en droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n[12] L'article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal n'exige pas que les parties produisent les documents pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9. Selon moi, si la revendication du privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est contest\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de la divulgation du processus, le Tribunal n'est pas tenu de d\u00e9cider de fa\u00e7on concluante si le privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est revendiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre. Dans des circonstances comme celles de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, o\u00f9 les questions en litige sont complexes et o\u00f9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en rapport avec les documents en question, il ne serait pas prudent, selon moi, de se prononcer de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive sur la question de savoir si les documents sont soumis au privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation.\n[13] Le droit au privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est fondamental et ne devrait pas \u00eatre supprim\u00e9 \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re (Smith c. Jones, (1999)1 R.C.S. 455 au par. 74). Au Qu\u00e9bec, on accorde une protection grande et g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse au droit du secret professionnel (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9nergie Foster WheelerLt\u00e9e c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intermunicipale de gestion et d'\u00e9limination des d\u00e9chets (SIGED) Inc., 2004 CSC 18, au par. 41.)\n[14] Par cons\u00e9quent, je crois que, dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'appr\u00e9cier si l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9tabli un argument plausible que le privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation s'applique aux documents demand\u00e9s et qu'il n'y a pas eu renonciation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce droit. S'il est \u00e9tabli que les documents en question sont peut-\u00eatre soumis au privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation, alors, selon moi, le Tribunal ne devrait pas ordonner la divulgation des documents en question. Il incombera donc au membre instructeur qui instruit la cause sur le fond de rendre une d\u00e9cision concluante, eu \u00e9gard aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et aux arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, quant \u00e0 savoir si les documents demand\u00e9s sont bel et bien soumis \u00e0 un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation valide et sont, par cons\u00e9quent, selon le paragraphe 50(4) de la Loi, inadmissibles en preuve.\n[15] La plaignante a fait valoir que si les documents ne sont pas divulgu\u00e9s avant l'audience et que si elle r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 r\u00e9futer la revendication du privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation quant aux documents demand\u00e9s, elle perdra le droit de produire ces documents en preuve, et ce, par application du paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit que, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'obtenir l'autorisation du membre instructeur une partie ne peut produire en preuve \u00e0 l'audience un document qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9. D'apr\u00e8s ma lecture de cette r\u00e8gle, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'accorder, \u00e0 la plaignante l'autorisation de produire en preuve des documents qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 l'audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, s'il d\u00e9cide que l'invocation du privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n'est pas fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal pourrait ordonner, si cela s'av\u00e9rait indiquer, que les documents soient divulgu\u00e9s et admis en preuve.\n[16] Est-il plausible d'avancer que le secret professionnel s'applique aux documents susmentionn\u00e9s et qu'il n'y a eu aucune renonciation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce droit? Je crois qu'il faut r\u00e9pondre par l'affirmative \u00e0 cette question. Selon moi, il existe une certaine logique dans les arguments suivants qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s par l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e.\nLe paragraphe 50(4) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne mentionne pas de quelle juridiction est issue le droit sur la preuve qui doit s'appliquer dans l'interpr\u00e9tation du terme confidentiel.\nPar application des articles 2 et 40 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, le Tribunal est tenu d'appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce le droit sur la preuve en vigueur dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Dans l'arr\u00eat Poulin c. Prat (1994) R.D.J. 301, la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon le droit du Qu\u00e9bec, appeler un t\u00e9moin expert \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner ne constitue pas une renonciation implicite \u00e0 l'immunit\u00e9 de divulgation des notes, brouillons, projets de rapport et autres documents produits par l'expert en pr\u00e9paration de la r\u00e9daction de son rapport final. De m\u00eame, en appelant l'expert \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, l'avocat qui a retenu les services de l'expert ne renonce pas \u00e0 l'immunit\u00e9 de divulgation des communications qu'il a eues avec ce dernier. Ce n'est qu'en rapport avec l'opinion d\u00e9finitive qui constitue le fondement du t\u00e9moignage de l'expert et qu'en rapport avec les sources factuelles sur lesquelles l'expert s'est fond\u00e9 en formulant son opinion que l'on peut dire qu'une partie a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'immunit\u00e9 de divulgation. La d\u00e9cision Poulin c. Prat n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 att\u00e9nu\u00e9e ou modifi\u00e9e par aucune d\u00e9cision ult\u00e9rieure de la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec ou de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Par cons\u00e9quent, en vertu de l'article 40 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, la d\u00e9cision Poulin c. Prat lie le Tribunal. L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la Commission a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui remette des \u00e9bauches du rapport de l'expert, les notes de ce dernier et des copies de la correspondance qu'il a \u00e9chang\u00e9e avec l'avocat qui a retenu ses services. L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que, selon Poulin c. Prat, tous ces documents sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l'immunit\u00e9 de divulgation.\n[17] Selon moi, la vraisemblance des arguments de l'intim\u00e9e sur ces questions n'est pas affaiblie de fa\u00e7on importante par les arguments formul\u00e9s par la Commission et la plaignante.\n[18] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que le Tribunal devrait appliquer les principes de common law concernant le privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation tels qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique dans l'arr\u00eat Vancouver Community College c. Phillips, Barrat, (1987), 20 B.C.L.R. (2d) 289, et subs\u00e9quemment appliqu\u00e9s dans le contexte f\u00e9d\u00e9ral par la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada dans Conseil canadien des ing\u00e9nieurs professionnels c. Universit\u00e9 Memorial de Terre-Neuve (1998), 159 F.T.R. 55. L'arr\u00eat Vancouver Community College appuie la proposition selon laquelle les documents r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux questions portant sur le fond de l'affaire ou la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre produits durant l'audience quand l'expert est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre. Toutefois, en supposant que la common law reconna\u00eet le droit \u00e0 de tels documents lors de l'audience, il n'y a aucune certitude que ce soit que ce droit existe \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape pr\u00e9alable (Conseil canadien des ing\u00e9nieurs professionnels c. Universit\u00e9 Memorial de Terre-Neuve, supra, par. 1).\n[19] Pour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission en vue d'obtenir une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de divulguer les documents susmentionn\u00e9s est rejet\u00e9e sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son droit de soulever \u00e0 nouveau la question \u00e0 l'audience sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte.\n[20] Il convient de souligner que ma conclusion que les documents font peut-\u00eatre l'objet d'un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation ne signifie pas que les documents font bel et bien l'objet d'un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation. Le membre instructeur qui instruit la cause sur le fond doit d\u00e9cider si, eu \u00e9gard aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et aux arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience, les documents demand\u00e9s sont bel et bien soumis au privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ils sont inadmissibles en preuve en vertu du paragraphe 50(4) de la Loi.\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision fait suite \u00e0 une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e, les Forces canadiennes, afin que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la plaignante, Micheline Montreuil, de divulguer certains documents.\n[2] La requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le contexte d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Montreuil. Celle-ci estime qu'elle est une transgend\u00e9riste. Dans sa plainte, elle pr\u00e9tend que les FC ont agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en raison de son sexe et d'une pr\u00e9tendue d\u00e9ficience lorsqu'elles ont refus\u00e9 de lui permettre de s'enr\u00f4ler dans les Forces en 1999.\n[3] L'intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 les documents suivants :\nle rapport d'expert du docteur Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, dat\u00e9 du 18 mars 1998; le rapport de d\u00e9ficience du docteur Jean Rodrigue, dat\u00e9 du 5 janvier 1998, d\u00e9montrant l'incapacit\u00e9 de travailler de la plaignante du 19 janvier 1998 au 19 ao\u00fbt 1998.\n[4] La plaignante d\u00e9clare que le rapport d'expert du docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit dans le contexte d'un grief qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre un ancien employeur, le Coll\u00e8ge Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier-Garneau. La question dans cette affaire consistait \u00e0 savoir si M. Montreuil, comme la plaignante se faisait appeler \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, \u00e9tait en mesure de consentir \u00e0 une entente de r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voyant qu'il quitterait volontairement ses fonctions au Coll\u00e8ge. M. Montreuil pr\u00e9tendait qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de prendre une d\u00e9cision avis\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il a consult\u00e9 un psychiatre, le docteur Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, qui a produit un rapport et a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour son compte dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure d'arbitrage. Des extraits du rapport du docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 sont cit\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre. Dans ces extraits, le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 indique que, lorsque M. Montreuil a sign\u00e9 l'entente en d\u00e9cembre 1997, il \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat de grande d\u00e9tresse apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois de sa vie \u00e0 sa double identit\u00e9. Il semblerait que le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 parlait alors de l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle de M. Montreuil.\n[5] Le rapport de d\u00e9ficience du docteur Rodrigue aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 une compagnie d'assurances \u00e0 l'appui d'une demande de couverture pour la p\u00e9riode allant de d\u00e9cembre 1997 \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 1998, durant laquelle M. Montreuil \u00e9tait incapable de travailler \u00e0 cause des troubles psychologiques dont il est question ci-dessus.\n[6] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e afin d'obtenir la divulgation des document indiqu\u00e9s ci-dessus, Mme Montreuil fait valoir que ces documents ne sont pas pertinents en l'esp\u00e8ce et qu'ils sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le secret professionnel. Ils ne devraient donc pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\n[7] Je suis d'accord avec l'intim\u00e9e lorsqu'elle dit que les documents peuvent \u00eatre pertinents en l'esp\u00e8ce. La capacit\u00e9 de Mme Montreuil de servir dans les Forces canadiennes est en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Les documents demand\u00e9s concernent des troubles psychologiques qui semblent d\u00e9couler, \u00e0 tout le moins en partie, de probl\u00e8mes relatifs \u00e0 son identit\u00e9 sexuelle. Les documents porteraient sur l'incapacit\u00e9 de travailler de Mme Montreuil pendant la plus grande partie de 1998 \u00e0 cause de ces troubles. C'est l'ann\u00e9e suivante, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le 30 juin 1999, qu'elle a essay\u00e9 de s'enr\u00f4ler dans les Forces canadiennes.\n[8] Ce qui est moins clair cependant, c'est si les documents en question sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation ou le secret professionnel, au sens o\u00f9 cette expression est employ\u00e9e dans le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Cette question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e par les parties. Mme Montreuil a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les documents sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le secret professionnel, sans toutefois pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'argumentation sur le sujet. Les pr\u00e9tentions des avocats de l'intim\u00e9e et de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne portent surtout sur la question de la pertinence. Aucune des parties n'a trait\u00e9 des questions relatives au privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation qui se posent dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[9] Compte tenu de ces consid\u00e9rations, la question sera examin\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience sur le fond de l'affaire, laquelle doit commencer le 23 octobre 2006.\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Le vendredi 13 octobre 2006, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u une requ\u00eate en ajournement de la part de la plaignante et de la Commission dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cette requ\u00eate faisait suite \u00e0 la divulgation, par l'intim\u00e9e, de cinq volumes de documents le 12 octobre 2006. L'avocat de la Commission et la plaignante se sont vivement oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 la divulgation tardive d'une telle quantit\u00e9 de documents et ont affirm\u00e9 qu'ils ne seraient pas en mesure de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement en vue de l'audience. La plaignante a demand\u00e9 que l'audience soit report\u00e9e au 4 d\u00e9cembre 2006 et que de nouvelles dates soient fix\u00e9es pour la poursuite de l'audience en 2007.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e s'est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en ajournement parce que les parties connaissaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 une grande partie des documents et qu'elles exag\u00e9raient la quantit\u00e9 de travail que repr\u00e9sentait l'examen de ceux-ci.\n[3] Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nombreuses autres requ\u00eates pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'audience. Conform\u00e9ment aux d\u00e9cisions d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendues par le Tribunal sur la question de la divulgation en l'esp\u00e8ce, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de laisser au membre instructeur qui entendra l'affaire sur le fond le soin de trancher la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. On aura peut-\u00eatre alors une meilleure id\u00e9e des documents sur lesquels l'intim\u00e9e entend se fonder, des documents qui sont v\u00e9ritablement nouveaux en ce sens qu'ils n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, et des documents qui doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s par les experts, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[4] Si un pr\u00e9judice est \u00e9tabli, le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pourrait s'appliquer. De plus, le Tribunal pourrait trouver des moyens pratiques de r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations des parties.

Le 13 septembre 2006, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u une lettre de M. Paul Fromm, qui, avec le consentement du Tribunal, avait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Dans sa lettre, M. Fromm demandait que l'affaire soit rouverte afin de pouvoir pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate demandant le rejet de la plainte de M. Richard Warman [traduction] \u00e0 cause de l'ambiance empoisonn\u00e9e et du harc\u00e8lement exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit parce qu'il \u00e9tait le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9, Terry Tremaine.\n[2] Le plaignant et la Commission ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites \u00e0 l'encontre de la demande de M. Fromm.\n[3] Je ne parlerai pas des all\u00e9gations contenues dans la lettre de M. Fromm car elles ne sont pas pertinentes au regard des questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. De plus, les parties dont il est question dans la lettre ne sont pas celles qui \u00e9taient concern\u00e9es par la plainte. Si je d\u00e9cidais de rouvrir l'affaire comme on me le demande, je devrais me prononcer sur une toute nouvelle affaire concernant de nouvelles parties. Je constate en outre que l'intim\u00e9, Terry Tremaine, n'a pas abord\u00e9 cette question devant le Tribunal ni indiquer comment ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements auraient pu influer sur sa cause. Je dois ajouter cependant que, m\u00eame s'il avait port\u00e9 cette question \u00e0 mon attention, je n'aurais eu aucune raison de rouvrir l'affaire sur la foi de ces all\u00e9gations. Je ne vois aucun lien entre les all\u00e9gations faites par M. Fromm dans sa lettre et les questions que je dois trancher dans ma d\u00e9cision.\n[4] Pour ces motifs, je rejette la demande de r\u00e9ouverture de M. Fromm.\n[5] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre de M. Fromm, la Commission a aussi demand\u00e9 des redressements au Tribunal, en particulier une ordonnance interdisant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser d'autres requ\u00eates sans avoir obtenu au pr\u00e9alable l'autorisation du Tribunal. Comme aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ou requ\u00eate n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal, je ne vois aucune raison de statuer sur cette demande pour le moment.\nMichel Doucet\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 17 octobre 2006\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T1104\/8505\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Richard Warman c.

Ou plut\u00f4t, bon apr\u00e8s-midi.\nLe greffier : Assoyez-vous\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Je vais traiter de la requ\u00eate qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise ce matin. Je l\u2019ai r\u00e9dig\u00e9, alors je ne ferai que la lire.\nDans sa plainte, le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu que les intim\u00e9s ont viol\u00e9 le paragraphe 3 (1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sur plusieurs motifs : la religion, la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, l\u2019orientation sexuelle.\nLe repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ce matin une requ\u00eate visant l\u2019obtention d\u2019une ordonnance que la membre se r\u00e9cuse en raison d\u2019une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\nPremi\u00e8rement, je souligne qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette requ\u00eate. Le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a incorpor\u00e9 dans sa requ\u00eate de nombreux extraits de ce qui sont cens\u00e9es \u00eatre des coupures de presse extraites d\u2019Internet. La preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e ou pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e selon la forme prescrite.\nIl est clairement \u00e9tabli en droit que le seuil est haut parce qu\u2019il existe une pr\u00e9somption de neutralit\u00e9. Le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir la partialit\u00e9 incombe \u00e0 la personne qui en all\u00e8gue l\u2019existence et cette all\u00e9gation doit \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concrets.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a choisi de ne pas pr\u00e9senter de tels \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. La demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour ce motif et c\u2019est ce que je conclus.\nDe plus, toutefois, subsidiairement, m\u00eame si les documents compris dans la d\u00e9claration de faits de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sont pris \u00e0 la lettre, je conclus que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e.\nPremi\u00e8rement, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas laiss\u00e9 entendre que la membre avait fait preuve de partialit\u00e9 dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente audience, laquelle est commenc\u00e9e depuis deux jours et demi.\nDe plus, rien ne laisse croire qu\u2019il existe un int\u00e9r\u00eat ou un lien direct entre la membre et la pr\u00e9sente instance ou entre la membre et les parties devant le tribunal.\nLe repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque plut\u00f4t les articles de presse, ce qui donne \u00e0 penser ce qui suit :\nPremi\u00e8rement, que la membre a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des clients qui sont membres des groupes minoritaires mentionn\u00e9s dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, notamment les clients gais et les clientes lesbiennes; que la membre a tenu publiquement des propos \u00e0 l\u2019appui des groupes minoritaires mentionn\u00e9s dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, notamment les gais et les lesbiennes; troisi\u00e8mement, que la membre elle-m\u00eame est peut-\u00eatre membre du groupe minoritaire mentionn\u00e9 dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et, en particulier, qu\u2019elle est peut-\u00eatre une lesbienne; enfin, que la membre a tenu des propos en rapport avec un projet de loi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un membre priv\u00e9 et examin\u00e9 par l\u2019assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative de l\u2019Alberta.\nLe repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a notamment relev\u00e9 que le commentaire suivant est particuli\u00e8rement r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur quant \u00e0 la partialit\u00e9. Ce commentaire est le suivant : [traduction] Les gens ont droit \u00e0 leurs opinions personnelles, mais ils n\u2019ont pas le droit de faire de la discrimination dans le domaine public.\nDonc, parlons d\u2019abord du droit et nous en avons discut\u00e9 ce matin. Le droit concernant la crainte de partialit\u00e9 traite un point qui est crucial. Il est crucial pour l\u2019administration de la justice que des parties \u00e0 un jugement aient droit \u00e0 une audience devant un juge qui est \u00e9quitable et impartial.\nLes crit\u00e8res servant \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier les all\u00e9gations de partialit\u00e9 ou la crainte de partialit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s par les cours de justice.\nMais d\u2019abord, il faut faire une distinction importante entre la neutralit\u00e9 judiciaire et l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 judiciaire et cette distinction a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans la jurisprudence. La neutralit\u00e9 judiciaire, quant \u00e0 elle, n\u2019est tout simplement pas possible. L\u2019impartialit\u00e9 judiciaire, elle, est cruciale quant \u00e0 l\u2019administration \u00e9quitable du processus administratif.\nLes juges L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 et McLachlin, dans la d\u00e9cision R c. RDS, [1997] 3 RCS 484, discutent en d\u00e9tails d\u2019une distinction tr\u00e8s importante, tr\u00e8s cruciale entre ces deux concepts et je renvoie au paragraphe 34 de cet arr\u00eat.\nJe vais en lire certains extraits parce que cela est particuli\u00e8rement important pour la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nLes juges L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 et McLachlin mentionnent ce qui suit :\nAfin d'appliquer le test \u2013 [il s\u2019agit du test pour la crainte de partialit\u00e9] \u2013 il est n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9tablir une distinction entre l'impartialit\u00e9, \u00e0 laquelle sont tenus tous les juges, et la neutralit\u00e9. Cette distinction fait \u00e9cho aux propos de Benjamin N Cardozo dans The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921), aux pages 12, 13 et 167, o\u00f9 il a affirm\u00e9 l'importance de l'impartialit\u00e9 tout en reconnaissant l'illusion de la neutralit\u00e9 du juge.\nLes juges renvoient aux propos suivants de M. Cardozo :\nIl y a en chacun de nous une tendance, qu'on peut appeler philosophie ou autre chose, qui donne coh\u00e9rence et orientation \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e et \u00e0 l'action. Le juge ne peut pas plus se soustraire \u00e0 ce courant que le commun des mortels. Sa vie durant, des forces dont il n'a pas conscience et qu'il ne peut nommer, l'ont entra\u00een\u00e9 \u2013 instincts, atavismes, croyances traditionnelles, convictions acquises; et la r\u00e9sultante est une perspective sur la vie, une conception des besoins sociaux. Chaque probl\u00e8me qui se pose \u00e0 l'esprit se d\u00e9tache sur cette toile de fond. Nous pouvons essayer de voir les choses le plus objectivement possible. Il n'emp\u00eache que nous ne pouvons les voir avec d'autres yeux que les n\u00f4tres propres. Dans notre subconscient se trouvent enfouies d'autres forces, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences et aversions, pr\u00e9dilections et pr\u00e9ventions, tout un ensemble d'instincts, d'\u00e9motions, d'habitudes et de convictions, qui font l'\u00eatre humain, qu'il soit juge ou justiciable.\nCardozo reconna\u00eet que l'objectivit\u00e9 est chose impossible parce que les juges, comme tous les autres \u00eatres humains, sont conditionn\u00e9s par leur propre perspective. Ainsi que l'a not\u00e9 le Conseil canadien de la magistrature dans ses Propos sur la conduite des juges (1991), \u00e0 la page 15, [t]out \u00eatre humain est le produit de son exp\u00e9rience sociale, de son \u00e9ducation et de ses contacts avec ceux et celles qui partagent le monde avec nous. Ce qui est possible et souhaitable, selon le Conseil, c'est l'impartialit\u00e9.\nEt c\u2019est l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 qui est exig\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.\nQue la membre se soit livrer \u00e0 un plaidoyer en faveur des droits de la personne peut nous amener \u00e0 conclure que, elle, comme d\u2019autres, n\u2019est pas neutre. Toutefois, cela ne nous am\u00e8ne pas \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019elle est impartiale.\nEt maintenant, nous devons examiner le test, le test quant \u00e0 une crainte de partialit\u00e9 et la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle il doit \u00eatre analys\u00e9. Je vais commencer, une fois de plus, avec la d\u00e9cision R. c. RDS, \u00e0 la page 12.\nLe test est celui de la personne bien renseign\u00e9e. Le test est donc le suivant :\n\u00c0 quelle conclusion en arriverait une personne bien renseign\u00e9e qui \u00e9tudierait la question en profondeur, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique. Croirait-elle que, selon toute vraisemblance, [le d\u00e9cideur], consciemment ou non, ne rendra pas une d\u00e9cision juste?\nJe me fie \u00e9galement aux motifs invoqu\u00e9s par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Z\u00fcndel, au paragraphe 36 :\nLa personne raisonnable doit de plus \u00eatre une personne bien renseign\u00e9e, au courant de l'ensemble des circonstances pertinentes, y compris des traditions historiques d'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et d'impartialit\u00e9, et consciente aussi du fait que l'impartialit\u00e9 est l'une des obligations que les juges ont fait le serment de respecter. Il faut faire preuve de rigueur.\nLa charge d\u2019\u00e9tablir la partialit\u00e9 incombe \u00e0 la personne qui en all\u00e8gue l\u2019existence.\nPlus loin, dans la d\u00e9cision Z\u00fcndel, on renvoie \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019affaire E.A. Manning Ltd. dans laquelle il est mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, sauf s\u2019il y a preuve du contraire, que les commissions agiront de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et impartiale dans l\u2019exercice de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s de d\u00e9cideur et examineront les circonstances et les faits particuliers de chaque affaire.\nAvant que nous ne discutions des faits, des all\u00e9gations mentionn\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente demande, nous devons nous poser la question suivante : Ces faits en eux-m\u00eames am\u00e8neraient-ils une personne raisonnable \u00e0 croire que la membre n\u2019examinera pas de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et impartiale l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et n\u2019appliquera pas de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et impartiale le droit pertinent aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve tels qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis ?\nEt nous devons examiner les directives donn\u00e9es par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans R. c. RDS quant \u00e0 la nature de cette personne raisonnable. Au paragraphe 48, il est mentionn\u00e9 que la personne raisonnable est une personne qui aborde la question de savoir s'il y a crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 avec une compr\u00e9hension nuanc\u00e9e et contextuelle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments en litige.\nLa personne raisonnable conna\u00eet la dynamique sociale \u2013 et je paraphrase le mot sociale -- de la collectivit\u00e9 locale et, en tant que membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne, elle souscrit aux principes d'\u00e9galit\u00e9.\nCela dit, examinons maintenant les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et demandons-nous si cette personne raisonnable, la personne raisonnable qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite par les juges L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 et McLachlin, croirait que la membre, pour des raisons de partialit\u00e9, ne serait pas capable de d\u00e9cider de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et impartiale l\u2019affaire dont le Tribunal est saisi.\nPremi\u00e8rement, on a laiss\u00e9 entendre que la membre est peut-\u00eatre vis\u00e9e par l\u2019un des cinq motifs en vertu desquels la pr\u00e9sente plainte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. S\u2019agit-il d\u2019un fait qui am\u00e8nerait une personne raisonnable, la personne raisonnable qu\u2019on a d\u00e9crite, \u00e0 d\u00e9cider qu\u2019il existe une crainte de partialit\u00e9?\nSelon moi, la personne raisonnable dont on parle ne conclurait pas que l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne compromet sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner la pr\u00e9sente affaire de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et impartiale. Et, franchement, conclure autrement serait contraire aux principes de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui prime en vertu de cette loi, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et qui, selon les juges L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 et McLachlin, constitue le fondement m\u00eame de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, le fait que la membre ait pu repr\u00e9senter des clients qui appartiennent aux groupes minoritaires prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, notamment les gais et les lesbiennes, am\u00e8nerait-il notre personne raisonnable \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 la partialit\u00e9?\nEt il est difficile \u2013 je ne vois pas comment cela pourrait possiblement donner naissance \u00e0 une crainte de partialit\u00e9 de la part de d\u00e9cideurs qui sont ou qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avocats repr\u00e9sentant des clients. On ne peut pas raisonnablement conclure que l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ces clients puisse d\u00e9terminer, compromettre ou refl\u00e9ter la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur \u00e0 \u00eatre impartial quant aux faits qui lui sont soumis.\nEt j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement frapp\u00e9 par les propos de M. Vigna que les criminalistes auraient beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 devenir juge si on les identifiait \u00e0 leurs clients.\nTroisi\u00e8mement, que la membre ait tenu publiquement des propos \u00e0 l\u2019appui des droits de la personne, notamment \u00e0 l\u2019appui des droits des gais et des lesbiennes. Et, une fois de plus, cela peut \u00eatre pertinent quant \u00e0 la question de la neutralit\u00e9. Encore une fois, on doit faire une distinction importante : cela peut \u00eatre pertinent quant \u00e0 la question de la neutralit\u00e9 et non pas quant \u00e0 la question de l\u2019impartialit\u00e9.\nEt, de plus, les lois de notre pays, notamment la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, visent express\u00e9ment \u00e0 favoriser les droits des groupes minoritaires. Les propos conformes \u00e0 ce principe fondamental de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne ne peuvent pas, selon moi, \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\nEt, en dernier lieu, en ce qui concerne les propos selon lesquels les gens ont droit \u00e0 leurs opinions personnelles, mais qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas le droit de faire de la discrimination dans le domaine public, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une articulation judicieuse des lois du Canada tel qu\u2019elle est formul\u00e9e dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et dans les lois des droits de la personne des autres provinces du Canada. Et donc, encore une fois, une telle d\u00e9claration ne peut pas donner naissance \u00e0 une crainte de partialit\u00e9.\nPour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJulie Lloyd Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 25 mai 2006\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1087\/6805 et T1088\/6905\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Richard Warman c.

La position d'Air Canada est que l'APAC devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9e.\n[4] Le Tribunal a de plus re\u00e7u de Fly Past 60 Coalition, un groupe de pilotes et d'anciens pilotes d'Air Canada, une demande dat\u00e9e du 20 juin 2006 en vue d'\u00eatre ajout\u00e9 comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte.\n[5] La Commission a consenti \u00e0 la demande de Fly Past 60 Coalition.

Hadjis\n2006 TCDP 48 2006\/10\/26 [TRADUCTION]\n[1] L'intim\u00e9, Marc Lemire, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate dans laquelle il demande qu'il soit ordonn\u00e9 que le plaignant, Richard Warman, soit ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[2] Selon la plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman, dat\u00e9e du 23 novembre 2003, M. Lemire est le propri\u00e9taire d'un site Web appel\u00e9 freedomsite.org, sur lequel il \u00e9tait soi-disant possible de voir des messages de propagande haineuse (c'est-\u00e0-dire du mat\u00e9riel qui est interdit suivant l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne). M. Warman pr\u00e9tend de plus dans la plainte que M. Lemire a affich\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame ce genre de mat\u00e9riel.\n[3] M. Lemire tente en fait par la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate de pr\u00e9senter sa propre plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne contre M. Warman. Il pr\u00e9tend que M. Warman a \u00e9crit et a affich\u00e9 ses messages de propagande haineuse sur ce m\u00eame site Web, freedomsite.org. M. Lemire soutient que M. Warman devrait par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 additionnel dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nLe Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence pour ajouter une partie \u00e0 une instruction existante? [4] La Loi n'\u00e9nonce pas express\u00e9ment que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'ordonner l'adjonction d'une partie \u00e0 une instruction qu'il tient, mais l'alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) pr\u00e9voit que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal peut faire des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure r\u00e9gissant l'adjonction de parties ou d'intervenants \u00e0 l'affaire.\n[5] Dans une d\u00e9cision rendue de vive voix, Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton (2 octobre 2002), Ottawa, T701\/0602 (T.C.D.P.), mentionn\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Brown c. Commission de la capitale nationale, 2003 TCDP 43, et dans la d\u00e9cision Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, section locale 5044 du SCFP c. Telus Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., 2003 TCDP 31 (Telus), Mme Mactavish, alors pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, a not\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle l'alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment l'adjonction de parties et d'intervenants aux instructions existantes du Tribunal. Compte tenu du libell\u00e9 de cet alin\u00e9a, elle a conclu que l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait de donner au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ajouter des parties \u00e0 une instruction suite \u00e0 une requ\u00eate lorsque le Tribunal le juge appropri\u00e9.\n[6] Le 3 octobre 2002, dans la m\u00eame affaire, la pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish a rendu de vive voix une d\u00e9cision subs\u00e9quente dans laquelle elle a mentionn\u00e9 que le contexte l\u00e9gislatif entourant le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'ajouter des parties donne \u00e0 penser que tout tel pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec prudence. L'adjonction d'une partie au cours d'une instruction peut priver le nouvel intim\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de certaines garanties proc\u00e9durales. Ces garanties incluraient la possibilit\u00e9 de convaincre la Commission au cours de son processus d'enqu\u00eate qu'elle devrait refuser de traiter la plainte parce que, par exemple, la plainte n'est pas fond\u00e9e ou parce qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai d'un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e (alin\u00e9a 41(1)e)). Ainsi, le Tribunal a conclu que m\u00eame si le texte de loi l'autorise \u00e0 ajouter un intim\u00e9, les cas o\u00f9 il sera permis de le faire sont passablement limit\u00e9s compte tenu de la perte de garanties proc\u00e9durales qui pourrait r\u00e9sulter d'une telle d\u00e9cision.\n[7] Le Tribunal, dans la d\u00e9cision Telus au paragraphe 30, a souscrit \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche prudente \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Desormeaux et a conclu que l'adjonction forc\u00e9e d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 serait appropri\u00e9e dans les cas o\u00f9 il est \u00e9tabli que la pr\u00e9sence d'une nouvelle partie est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte dont il est saisi et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible une fois la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission que l'adjonction d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 serait n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte. Comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Brown, au paragraphe 20, il s'agit d'un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 d\u00e9crivant l'\u00e9tat du droit sur la question.\nL'adjonction de M. Warman \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 est-elle n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi? [8] M. Lemire ne m'a pas convaincu qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que M. Warman soit ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 pour disposer de la plainte dont le Tribunal est maintenant saisi. Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte que M. Lemire est le propri\u00e9taire inscrit du site Web freedomsite.org et qu'il a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit de personnes ou de groupes de personnes de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur des motifs illicites par la communication de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e de messages de propagande haineuse, en sa qualit\u00e9 d'administrateur et de propri\u00e9taire de ce site Web, et par ses affichages personnels sur le site Web.\n[9] De quelle mani\u00e8re le fait d'inclure M. Warman \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 additionnel aide-t-il \u00e0 disposer de la plainte? Le seul argument de M. Lemire sur ce point semble \u00eatre que M. Warman a affich\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s messages de propagande haineuse comme moyen de pi\u00e9ger des individus comme M. Lemire, contre lesquels il a par la suite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Je crois comprendre que ce que pr\u00e9tend M. Lemire c'est que M. Warman, en faisant ces pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s affichages sur le site Web, a en quelque sorte incit\u00e9 d'autres individus \u00e0 afficher leurs propres messages de propagande haineuse.\n[10] Il m'appara\u00eet que cet argument est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme moyen de d\u00e9fense aux all\u00e9gations d'actes discriminatoires contenues dans la plainte. Si un tel moyen de d\u00e9fense est fond\u00e9 suivant la Loi, il me semble qu'il pourrait \u00eatre soulev\u00e9 par un intim\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que le soi-disant instigateur \u00e0 commettre l'acte discriminatoire soit nomm\u00e9 ou non \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 additionnel dans l'affaire.\n[11] M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9cision Brown, dans laquelle le Tribunal a permis l'adjonction d'une ti\u00e8rce partie \u00e0 la plainte, appuie sa position. Cependant, les circonstances de l'affaire Brown sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes de celles de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Le plaignant, M. Brown, souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience. Il avait soutenu que la Commission de la capitale nationale (CCN) avait exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 son endroit par son omission de lui avoir fourni un acc\u00e8s en fauteuil roulant \u00e0 un parc d'Ottawa qui relevait de la CCN. Il pr\u00e9tendait que le seul acc\u00e8s offert \u00e9tait par un escalier de plusieurs marches, connu sous le nom d'escalier de la rue York. Au cours de l'audience, on a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve donnant \u00e0 penser qu'une solution possible au probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait de fournir un acc\u00e8s public \u00e0 un ascenseur situ\u00e9 dans un \u00e9difice voisin, appartenant au minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux (Travaux publics). La Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate dans laquelle elle demandait que le Tribunal ordonne l'adjonction de Travaux publics \u00e0 titre de co-intim\u00e9.\n[12] Le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 que dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la plainte de M. Brown \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, l'adjonction de Travaux publics pourrait \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour mettre en uvre une solution viable au probl\u00e8me r\u00e9sultant de l'escalier de la rue York. Compte tenu de la preuve selon laquelle l'ascenseur dans l'\u00e9difice de Travaux publics pourrait fournir l'acc\u00e8s dont on avait besoin pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire, Travaux publics aurait un r\u00f4le indispensable \u00e0 jouer pour r\u00e9soudre tout probl\u00e8me de discrimination (Brown, au paragraphe 43). Par cons\u00e9quent, dans l'affaire Brown, le Tribunal se heurtait \u00e0 la r\u00e9elle possibilit\u00e9 que sans la pleine participation \u00e0 l'affaire de la partie adjointe, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d'ordonner un redressement efficace \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire.\n[13] On ne peut pas dire la m\u00eame chose dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. On ne m'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 de quelle mani\u00e8re la capacit\u00e9 du Tribunal de rendre contre M. Lemire des ordonnances de redressement efficaces suivant la Loi sera entrav\u00e9e si M. Warman n'est pas ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire pas plus qu'on ne m'a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la participation de M. Warman \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire ou indispensable pour trancher toute question de discrimination soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte de M. Warman.\n[14] Si M. Lemire est d'avis que M. Warman a contrevenu \u00e0 la Loi, il est libre de d\u00e9poser aupr\u00e8s de la Commission sa propre plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Cependant, pour le moment, le Tribunal est saisi d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman contre M. Lemire. L'adjonction de M. Warman \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte. La requ\u00eate de M. Lemire est rejet\u00e9e.\n[15] Finalement, je remarque qu'une grande portion des observations des parties \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate traite du fonctionnement administratif du site Web et de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e preuve des visites de M. Warman sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique du site Web. Compte tenu de mes conclusions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du caract\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9 de l'adjonction de M. Warman \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ces observations n'ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre trait\u00e9es pour le moment.\nAthanasios D.

Une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement sexuel figurait \u00e9galement dans la plainte.\n[2] Mme Mowat a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que des repr\u00e9sailles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es contre elle, en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la Loi. Cette all\u00e9gation a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par voie de requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire et a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le Tribunal.\n[3] Dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal, Mme Mowat a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 de 430 685 $ (ce montant ne comprenait pas les montants ind\u00e9termin\u00e9s pour les cotisations au RPC, pour la pension des FAC, pour souffrances morales et dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats exemplaires pour mauvaise foi) excluant les frais juridiques.\n[4] Le Tribunal a conclu que la plainte de harc\u00e8lement sexuel d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Mowat \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e et lui a accord\u00e9 un montant de 4 000 $ plus des int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 toutes les autres all\u00e9gations de discrimination que Mme Mowat avait soumises.\n[5] L'audition de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Mowat a dur\u00e9 environ 6 semaines. La transcription des t\u00e9moignages rendus au cours de l'instance comprenait plus de 4 000 pages. De plus, plus de 200 pi\u00e8ces ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises au Tribunal.\n[6] Le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision que, outre l'all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement sexuel faite par Mme Mowat, l'instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par le fait que Mme Mowat n'a tout simplement pas expos\u00e9 avec pr\u00e9cision la nature de sa th\u00e8se. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s utile que Mme Mowat pr\u00e9cise les faits qu'elle relatait et qu'elle fasse le lien entre ces faits et les motifs de distinction illicites.\n[7] De toute \u00e9vidence, la grande majorit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des pi\u00e8ces produites par Mme Mowat avaient trait \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable dans l'emploi, au d\u00e9faut de la FAC de continuer de l'employer et au harc\u00e8lement (autre que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel). Toutes ces all\u00e9gations furent rejet\u00e9es.\n[8] Mme Mowat demande maintenant le remboursement de ses frais juridiques. Trois relev\u00e9s de services d'avocat \u00e9manant de Feehely, Gastaldi, les avocats de Mme Mowat, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au Tribunal. Ces relev\u00e9s de services couvrent la p\u00e9riode du 27 mars 2003 au 24 octobre 2005. Ils s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent \u00e0 un montant total de 196 313 $. Mme Mowat r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement un montant de 800 $ pour les frais pay\u00e9s \u00e0 Gahrns, Lalibert\u00e9, \u00e0 titre de services juridiques encourus avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte le 15 juin 1998.\n[9] Les deux parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations orales et \u00e9crites au Tribunal sur la question des frais juridiques. Mme Mowat a d'abord r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des frais \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 importante ou, subsidiairement, \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 partielle. Dans les observations qu'elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal, Mme Mowat a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne s'attendait pas \u00e0 se voir adjuger 100 p. 100 ou m\u00eame 75 p. 100 de ses frais juridiques, mais qu'elle s'attendait \u00e0 se voir adjuger des frais juridiques raisonnables, peu importe qu'elle obtienne gain de cause en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie.\n[10] Les FAC ont contest\u00e9 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'adjuger des frais juridiques. Toutefois, si le Tribunal se d\u00e9clarait comp\u00e9tent, les FAC ont pr\u00e9tendu que Mme Mowat ne devrait recevoir aucun montant \u00e0 titre de frais juridiques ou ne devrait recevoir, tout au plus, qu'un montant tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9. En effet, la majorit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de Mme Mowat ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es. De plus, l'audition a \u00e9t\u00e9 inutilement longue et complexe parce que Mme Mowat n'a pas formul\u00e9 ses plaintes de fa\u00e7on claire.\nLa comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'adjuger des frais juridiques [11] Si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des frais juridiques, il doit en \u00eatre fait mention aux alin\u00e9as 53(2)c) ou 53(2)d) de la Loi, lesquels pr\u00e9voient que le Tribunal peut ordonner d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des [...] et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte.\n[12] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu cinq d\u00e9cisions qui traitent de la question de savoir si le Tribunal peut ordonner, en vertu de la Loi, le versement d'une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de frais juridiques. Il n'y a cependant pas unanimit\u00e9 sur cette question. Ces d\u00e9cisions, par ordre chronologique, sont les suivantes :\n[13] La d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Thwaites, [1994] 3 C.F. 38 portait sur une r\u00e9clamation fond\u00e9e sur l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) pour les frais d'avocats raisonnables, y compris le co\u00fbt de l'expertise actuarielle. La Cour \u00e9tait d'accord avec le Tribunal que le plaignant devrait se voir adjuger un montant pour ces frais. Le sens ordinaire de l'expression d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es ne doit pas \u00eatre restreint. Les mots frais\/frais d'avocats n'ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9s dans les lois. Les mots utilis\u00e9s dans la Loi doivent se voir accorder leur sens ordinaire \u00e0 moins que le contexte ne s'y oppose.\n[14] Apr\u00e8s Thwaites, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Lambie, (1996), 124 F.T.R. 303. Dans Lambie, il \u00e9tait question de versement d'une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)d) pour les cong\u00e9s et le temps pris par le plaignant pour \u00e9laborer et pr\u00e9parer sa plainte. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la demande de versement d'une indemnit\u00e9 en affirmant que le mot d\u00e9penses n'est pas assez large pour couvrir le temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de la plainte, sauf dans des circonstances exceptionnelles. Dans cette affaire, rien n'indiquait que les cong\u00e9s et le temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de la plainte constituaient des circonstances exceptionnelles. Le l\u00e9gislateur aurait facilement pu mentionner dans la Loi que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des frais juridiques mais il ne l'a pas fait.\n[15] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Green (2000), 183 F.T.R. 161, a essentiellement tir\u00e9 la m\u00eame conclusion qu'elle avait tir\u00e9e dans Lambie. Le Tribunal avait ordonn\u00e9 que la plaignante soit indemnis\u00e9e pour ses frais juridiques et la preuve indiquait que la plaignante avait retenu les services d'un avocat pour l'aider \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer les observations qu'elle soumettrait \u00e0 la CCDP dans le cadre des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du processus d\u00e9cisionnel de cette derni\u00e8re. La Cour a jug\u00e9 que l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)d) ne fait aucune allusion aux frais juridiques et que cela indique que le l\u00e9gislateur ne voulait pas que le Tribunal ait le pouvoir d'adjuger des frais juridiques.\n[16] Dans les d\u00e9cisions Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Stevenson, (2003), CFPI 341 et Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Brooks, (2006), CF 500, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu le contraire et a abond\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens que dans Thwaites.\n[17] Dans la d\u00e9cision Stevenson, le plaignant demandait \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) pour les honoraires de l'avocat qu'il avait consult\u00e9 en rapport avec la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP et pour les honoraires d'avocat encourus pour la pr\u00e9paration de ses observations soumises \u00e0 la CCDP.\n[18] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que les frais juridiques encourus par un plaignant lorsqu'il consulte un avocat \u00e0 propos du bien-fond\u00e9 de sa plainte sont tout \u00e0 fait justifiables. Les honoraires d'avocat et (ou) frais juridiques encourus pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte constituent des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte.\n[19] L'absence des expressions frais juridiques ou honoraires d'avocat \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) n'est pas d\u00e9terminante. Le libell\u00e9 de cet alin\u00e9a est suffisamment large pour comprendre le pouvoir d'adjudication de frais juridiques. \u00c0 l'appui de cette position, la Cour a invoqu\u00e9 le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi en affirmant qu'il pr\u00e9voit clairement qu'un plaignant peut retenir les services d'un avocat afin d'obtenir des conseils.\n[20] Selon la d\u00e9cision Stevenson, on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Lambie que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des frais juridiques, mais seulement dans des cas exceptionnels. Le cong\u00e9 et le temps indemnis\u00e9s dans cette affaire ne constituaient pas des circonstances exceptionnelles.\n[21] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Green, la Cour, dans Stevenson, a soulign\u00e9 que l'on n'avait pas conclu dans cette affaire \u00e0 l'existence de circonstances exceptionnelles qui justifiaient la demande de versement d'une indemnit\u00e9.\n[22] Il est \u00e9galement important de souligner que, dans la d\u00e9cision Stevenson, la Cour a reconnu les consid\u00e9rations de principe sous-jacentes mentionn\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel du Canada, (2001) D.C.D.P. no29 (Q.L.).\n[23] Dans cette d\u00e9cision le Tribunal a conclu ce qui suit : certaines consid\u00e9rations de principe imp\u00e9rieuses relatives \u00e0 l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne militent en faveur de l'adoption de la m\u00e9thode suivie dans Thwaites. \u00c0 mon avis, si je donnais au mot d\u00e9penses un sens aussi \u00e9troit que celui que le juge Lemieux y a donn\u00e9 dans Green, privant ainsi les victimes d'un acte discriminatoire du droit de recouvrer les frais juridiques raisonnables li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audition de leur plainte, j'irais \u00e0 l'encontre du principe qui sous-tend la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, soit le principe de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[24] Dans la d\u00e9cision Brooks, la demande de versement d'une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) pour des frais juridiques li\u00e9s \u00e0 un litige devant le Tribunal. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'analyse approfondie de la jurisprudence effectu\u00e9e par la Cour dans Stevenson et a souscrit \u00e0 l'opinion exprim\u00e9e dans Stevenson selon laquelle il n'y a aucune raison de limiter le sens ordinaire des mots d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire pour exclure les frais du litige, de la poursuite ou autres proc\u00e9dures judiciaires.\n[25] La Cour a rejet\u00e9 l'argument selon lequel la d\u00e9cision Stevenson devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme n'acceptant que les frais juridiques encourus avant une poursuite. Non seulement le Tribunal peut adjuger ces frais, mais il peut \u00e9galement adjuger les frais juridiques courants encourus dans le cadre du litige.\n[26] De plus, dans la d\u00e9cision Brooks, la Cour, selon moi, a approuv\u00e9 les consid\u00e9rations de principe \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Brooks. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit : [l]e Tribunal a une obligation de prot\u00e9ger l'efficacit\u00e9 et l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Tout l'objet de la Loi est de fournir un redressement valable \u00e0 ceux qui ont fait l'objet de discrimination. Je ne vois pas comment cela est possible, du moins dans un cas dans lequel la Commission d\u00e9cide de ne pas compara\u00eetre, sans une adjudication des d\u00e9pens [...]\nCONCLUSION SUR LA COMP\u00c9TENCE [27] Ce qui ressort de la jurisprudence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Thwaites, Stevenson et Brooks) c'est que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'adjuger des frais juridiques en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi. M\u00eame dans Lambie, selon Stevenson, on a reconnu que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des frais juridiques dans des circonstances exceptionnelles.\n[28] Compte tenu de cette jurisprudence, je conclus que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des frais juridiques en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi.\n[29] Je ne me fonde pas uniquement sur les d\u00e9cisions susmentionn\u00e9es pour tirer cette conclusion. Je me fonde \u00e9galement sur les consid\u00e9rations de principe \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans les d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Tribunal dans Nkwazi et Brooks, lesquelles d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Stevenson et Brooks. Selon moi, si on conclue que le Tribunal n'a pas le pouvoir d'adjuger des frais juridiques lorsqu'une plainte d'acte discriminatoire est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, alors cette conclusion n'\u00e9quivaut tout au plus qu'\u00e0 une victoire co\u00fbteuse pour le plaignant. Un tel r\u00e9sultat ferait \u00e9chec aux dispositions r\u00e9paratrices et irait \u00e0 l'encontre de l'objet de la Loi.\nQU'EST-CE QUI CONSTITUE EN L'ESP\u00c8CE UNE ADJUDICATION RAISONNABLE DE FRAIS JURIDIQUES? [30] Le paragraphe 53(2) exige que les frais juridiques aient \u00e9t\u00e9 encourus en raison de la pratique discriminatoire. La pratique discriminatoire en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait le harc\u00e8lement sexuel exerc\u00e9 contre Mme Mowat par les FAC. Il appert de la jurisprudence que le Tribunal peut adjuger des frais juridiques pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'audience ainsi que des frais juridiques pour les frais encourus pour la repr\u00e9sentation actuelle par avocat.\n[31] En fixant l'adjudication des frais juridiques, j'ai tenu compte de trois sources : la description des services juridiques figurant dans les relev\u00e9s de services d'avocat soumis par Mme Mowat; la quantit\u00e9 d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de pi\u00e8ces soumis \u00e0 l'audience en rapport avec l'all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement sexuel par rapport \u00e0 l'ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 l'appui des all\u00e9gations rejet\u00e9es et le m\u00e9moire de frais soumis par chacune des parties calcul\u00e9 selon la formule partie-partie.\n[32] Je suis conscient que le Tribunal, dans Brooks, s'est servi des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales (les R\u00e8gles), plus particuli\u00e8rement du paragraphe 400(3), pour se guider dans l'appr\u00e9ciation des frais.\n[33] En ce qui concerne la question de l'appr\u00e9ciation des frais (et non pas la question de la comp\u00e9tence), la cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Elle a fait cela parce que le Tribunal, apr\u00e8s avoir renvoy\u00e9 aux R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, n'a pas tenu compte des offres de r\u00e8glement \u00e9crites faites par l'intim\u00e9e, ce qu'il \u00e9tait tenu de faire en vertu des paragraphes 400(3) et 420(2) des R\u00e8gles.\n[34] Toutefois, je ne vois rien dans la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Brooks qui exige que le Tribunal applique les R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ou m\u00eame renvoie \u00e0 celles-ci lorsqu'il adjuge des d\u00e9pens. Je ne l'ai pas fait en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[35] Me fondant sur les sources susmentionn\u00e9es ainsi que sur les observations orales et \u00e9crites des parties, j'adjuge \u00e0 Mme Mowat le montant de 47 000 $ au titre des frais juridiques, et ce, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi.\n[36] Mme Mowat a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui accorde des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur le montant des frais juridiques adjug\u00e9. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats ne sont pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant une d\u00e9pense en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi. Le Tribunal, en vertu du paragraphe 53(4), peut accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats, et ce, afin d'indemniser compl\u00e8tement la victime d'une pratique discriminatoire. Selon la preuve, il n'est pas clair que Mme Mowat a acquitt\u00e9 l'un ou l'autre des relev\u00e9es de services d'avocat qu'elle a re\u00e7us (autre que le relev\u00e9 de compte de 800 $ \u00e9mis par Gahrns, Lalibert\u00e9) ou qu'elle a pay\u00e9 des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les relev\u00e9s de services d'avocat en souffrance. Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Mowat que le montant adjug\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de frais juridiques porte int\u00e9r\u00eats jusqu'\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est rejet\u00e9e.\n[37] Toutefois, j'ordonne que le montant adjug\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de frais juridiques porte int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 partir de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision jusqu'\u00e0 la date du paiement du montant de l'adjudication et que ces int\u00e9r\u00eats soient calcul\u00e9s selon la formule prescrite \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 9(12)a) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJ.

ORDONNANCE\n[1] Le 27 septembre 2000, Ken O'Connor a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) une plainte all\u00e9guant que la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (le CN) avait enfreint l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne en exer\u00e7ant \u00e0 son endroit en cours d'emploi de la discrimination du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[2] Le 4 octobre 2004, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction. Le CN demande maintenant au Tribunal d'exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser d'entendre la plainte de M. O'Connor compte tenu du fait que l'affaire a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re concluante dans le contexte d'un r\u00e8glement des griefs par voie d'arbitrage. Le CN invoque \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e et celle de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nI. LE CONTEXTE [3] M. O'Connor a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour le CN \u00e0 Capreol (Ontario) en avril 1980 en tant qu'agent d'entretien de la voie. En 1981, il a subi une blessure au bas du dos pendant qu'il \u00e9tait au travail. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il a eu de nouveau en 1987 de graves probl\u00e8mes de dos r\u00e9sultant de cette blessure, il a par la suite subi deux op\u00e9rations au dos.\n[4] La Commission des accidents du travail d'alors (maintenant la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l'assurance contre les accidents du travail (CSPAAT)) a \u00e9valu\u00e9 M. O'Connor et, en 1992, il a obtenu une pension d'invalidit\u00e9 partielle permanente de 20 pour 100 (la pension d'IPP). Cette pension \u00e9tait assujettie aux restrictions de travail permanentes suivantes :\nNe pas lever des poids de plus de dix kilogrammes. Ne pas pencher ou tordre le corps de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9titive, notamment s'il y a une force de r\u00e9sistance. Ne pas tirer ou pousser de fa\u00e7on vigoureuse. Ne pas faire trop de travail au ras du sol. Pouvoir changer de position si n\u00e9cessaire.\n[5] Suivant une entente avec la Commission des accidents du travail, le CN payait la pension directement \u00e0 M. O'Connor.\n[6] De 1990 \u00e0 1995, M. O'Connor a obtenu de la formation et du recyclage professionnel au Coll\u00e8ge Cambrian par l'interm\u00e9diaire des services de r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle de la CSPAAT. Compte tenu de sa nouvelle formation, M. O'Connor a trouv\u00e9 un emploi, pour une courte p\u00e9riode, en tant qu'assistant dans un centre de d\u00e9sintoxication. Toutefois, selon M. O'Connor, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de trouver un emploi \u00e0 plein temps dans ce domaine dans lequel les fonctions \u00e9taient physiquement moins exigeantes que l'\u00e9taient les fonctions de son poste au CN.\n[7] En juillet 1997, le m\u00e9decin de famille de M. O'Connor lui a dit qu'il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner travailler au CN sans restrictions. Ayant en main un certificat m\u00e9dical attestant sa condition physique, M. O'Connor a demand\u00e9 au CN de lui redonner du travail. Une \u00e9valuation d'analyse fonctionnelle compl\u00e9t\u00e9e en ao\u00fbt 1998 confirmait qu'il n'y avait pas de restrictions physiques emp\u00eachant M. O'Connor de reprendre \u00e0 plein temps la charge compl\u00e8te de son poste d'entretien de la voie et de contrema\u00eetre qu'il occupait ant\u00e9rieurement.\n[8] C'est l\u00e0 qu'appara\u00eet une ombre au dossier. Au moment de la demande de M. O'Connor, le CN payait encore \u00e0 ce dernier une pension d'invalidit\u00e9 partielle permanente (pension d'IPP) fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9cision de la CSPAAT selon laquelle M. O'Connor avait des restrictions de travail permanentes. Apparemment, en raison de la politique de la CSPAAT, ces restrictions et l'exigence voulant que le CN paie une pension d'IPP ne pouvaient dans aucune circonstance \u00eatre lev\u00e9es.\n[9] En f\u00e9vrier 2000, le m\u00e9decin du CN a refus\u00e9 de recommander la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de M. O'Connor pour deux raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, il a exprim\u00e9 une pr\u00e9occupation selon laquelle un retour \u00e0 plein temps au travail \u00e9tait incompatible avec les restrictions permanentes impos\u00e9es par la CSPAAT pour lesquelles M. O'Connor continuait \u00e0 recevoir une pension. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le m\u00e9decin du CN \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 quant aux effets qu'auraient les m\u00e9dicaments contre la douleur que M. O'Connor prenait sur sa capacit\u00e9 d'effectuer son travail de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire.\n[10] Le CN, se fondant sur l'opinion de son m\u00e9decin, a refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer M. O'Connor au travail. Cependant, le CN a par la suite offert \u00e0 M. O'Connor plusieurs autres postes r\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00eatre compatibles avec les restrictions de la CSPAAT. M. O'Connor n'a pas accept\u00e9 ces offres.\n[11] En septembre 2000, M. O'Connor a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne une plainte all\u00e9guant que le CN, en omettant de le r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans le poste qu'il occupait auparavant et de lui fournir un accommodement quant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience, avait exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 son endroit.\n[12] Avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. O'Connor, le syndicat le repr\u00e9sentant avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre le CN un grief qui mentionnait l'omission du CN d'offrir \u00e0 M. O'Connor un accommodement quant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience et les violations \u00e0 la convention collective. Ce grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu le 13 janvier 2004 par M. Michel Picher du Bureau d'arbitrage des chemins de fer du Canada.\n[13] M. Picher a par la suite rendu une d\u00e9cision par laquelle il rejetait le grief en d\u00e9clarant qu'il \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 pour le CN de limiter les postes auxquels M. O'Connor \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 ceux compatibles avec les restrictions impos\u00e9es par la CSPAAT. Il a en outre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le CN s'\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. O'Connor.\n[14] Le 4 octobre 2004, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. O'Connor. \u00c0 la suite de certaines divulgations et d'un \u00e9change de documents pr\u00e9liminaires entre les parties, le CN a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de faire rejeter la plainte en invoquant la chose jug\u00e9e et l'abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nII. LA QUESTION EN LITIGE [15] La seule question \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est celle de savoir si la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e compte tenu de la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e ou de la doctrine de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[16] Pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s expos\u00e9s, j'estime que les deux doctrines s'appliquent dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. De plus, j'estime que, dans les circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce, il n'y a aucune raison d'exercer mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser d'appliquer les doctrines. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte de M. O'Connor d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre le CN est rejet\u00e9e.\nIII. L'ANALYSE A. La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de traiter la requ\u00eate [17] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour traiter la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le CN \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la Commission a statu\u00e9 effectivement sur cette question. Les arguments du CN \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e et de celle de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure avaient carr\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s devant la Commission lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne peut pas statuer sur la requ\u00eate sans qu'il s'agisse d'un contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, et c'est l\u00e0 une comp\u00e9tence qui rel\u00e8ve exclusivement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[18] Je ne souscris pas aux arguments de la Commission \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81, au paragraphe 10 (Cremasco), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Section de premi\u00e8re instance) a statu\u00e9 que lorsque le Tribunal statue sur une requ\u00eate visant la chose jug\u00e9e, sa d\u00e9cision ne constitue pas un contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal. La question en cause dans une requ\u00eate visant la chose jug\u00e9e est celle de savoir si le fait d'entendre \u00e0 nouveau une affaire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e devant un autre tribunal constituerait un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Il s'agit d'une question plut\u00f4t diff\u00e9rente de la question soulev\u00e9e dans une requ\u00eate demandant au Tribunal d'examiner la question de savoir si cela constituait un abus de la proc\u00e9dure de la Commission que d'avoir renvoy\u00e9 une plainte qui est, par exemple, hors d\u00e9lai (International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Section maritime), section locale 400 c. Oster, [2002] 2 C.F. 430 (1re inst.)).\n[19] Il est vrai que dans l'affaire Cremasco, la Cour a conclu que la question de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure n'avait pas carr\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la Commission lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer l'affaire au Tribunal. Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour ne d\u00e9pend pas de cette question. Plut\u00f4t, le point essentiel de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour dans l'affaire Cremasco est que le Tribunal, \u00e0 titre de ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure, a une obligation de s'assurer qu'il n'y a pas un abus de sa proc\u00e9dure. Si les circonstances de l'affaire font que cela constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure ou qu'il serait contraire \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice que l'affaire soit entendue par le Tribunal, alors le Tribunal peut refuser d'entendre l'affaire m\u00eame si la Commission l'a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\nB. La doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e [20] La doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e a deux raisons d'\u00eatre communes. La premi\u00e8re consiste \u00e0 assurer l'irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9. La deuxi\u00e8me est qu'une partie ne devrait pas \u00eatre tourment\u00e9e deux fois pour une m\u00eame affaire (Cremasco c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 30 septembre 2002 - d\u00e9cision no 1, au paragraphe 50, confirm\u00e9e par 2004 CAF 363).\n[21] Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a statu\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, le r\u00e8glement rapide, d\u00e9finitif et ex\u00e9cutoire des conflits de travail rev\u00eat une importance fondamentale, tant pour les parties que pour l'ensemble de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (Parry Sound (District) Conseil d'administration des services sociaux c. S.E.E.F.P.O., section locale 324, 2003 CSC 42, au paragraphe 50).\n[22] Cependant, il y a eu \u00e9galement une certaine r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 appliquer la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e aux d\u00e9cisions rendues en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne par des tribunaux comme le Tribunal en l'esp\u00e8ce. Une des principales pr\u00e9occupations est que le rejet d'une plainte prive les parties de la possibilit\u00e9 de faire trancher le fond de l'affaire par un tribunal sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des litiges en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne (voir par exemple la d\u00e9cision Gohm c. Domtar Inc. (No 1) (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/5968, au paragraphe 43199 (Ont. Bd. Inq.), et la d\u00e9cision Withler c. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 BCSC 820, au paragraphe 42). Par cons\u00e9quent, nombreux sont ceux qui ont incit\u00e9 \u00e0 la prudence et \u00e0 la retenue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'application de la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e aux d\u00e9cisions portant sur des plaintes en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne (Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 83, et Buffet c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 16, au paragraphe 40).\n[23] Toutefois, il existe un consensus clair sur deux points : l'application de la doctrine doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e au cas par cas, en accordant une grande attention aux faits particuliers de l'affaire, et les arbitres ont un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire leur permettant de refuser d'appliquer la doctrine si le fait de l'appliquer entra\u00eenerait une injustice.\nC. Les deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e [24] La doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e comporte deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments principaux. Le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment est connu comme la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e. La pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'applique lorsqu'il y a des questions communes dans les deux instances. Les questions en litige dans la deuxi\u00e8me instance doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 essentielles \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision dans la premi\u00e8re instance. Selon la nature de la question pour laquelle la pr\u00e9clusion est soulev\u00e9e, la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e peut faire obstacle \u00e0 ce que soit remise en cause une question distincte seulement ou faire obstacle \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me action dans son entier (Hough c. Brunswick Centres Inc., (1997), 9 C.P.C. (4th) 111 (Div. g\u00e9n. Ont.), aux paragraphes 24 et 25).\n[25] Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la chose jug\u00e9e est connu comme l'irrecevabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant de l'identit\u00e9 des causes d'action. Dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, les parties n'ont pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 l'irrecevabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant de l'identit\u00e9 des causes d'action. Par cons\u00e9quent, je vais limiter mon analyse \u00e0 l'application de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e.\nD. La pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e : le crit\u00e8re [26] Le crit\u00e8re en deux volets pour l'application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e est maintenant bien connu : (1) les conditions d'application de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e doivent \u00eatre remplies; (2) si ces conditions sont remplies, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9cider, en se fondant sur certains facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires, s'il est appropri\u00e9, dans les circonstances, d'appliquer la doctrine (arr\u00eat Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., [2001] 2 R.C.S. 460, au paragraphe 33).\n[27] Les conditions qui doivent \u00eatre remplies pour l'application de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e sont les suivantes :\nLes questions \u00e0 trancher sont les m\u00eames dans les deux instances; la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e comme cr\u00e9ant la pr\u00e9clusion est une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive; les parties, ou leurs ayants droit, sont les m\u00eames.\n(i) Les questions \u00e0 trancher sont les m\u00eames dans les deux instances [28] Il faut, pour que cette condition soit remplie, que la d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question en litige dans la premi\u00e8re instance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire au r\u00e9sultat (Minott c. O'Shanter Development Co. (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), au paragraphe 23). Autrement dit, la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e couvre des questions fondamentales tranch\u00e9es dans la premi\u00e8re instance, des questions qui \u00e9taient essentielles \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision.\n[29] M. O'Connor pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre se limitait \u00e0 la question de savoir s'il avait le droit d'invoquer son anciennet\u00e9 pour retourner \u00e0 son poste initial avec pleine r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Selon M. O'Connor, l'arbitre n'a pas trait\u00e9 de la question essentielle de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne qui est la question suivante : La condition impos\u00e9e par le CN selon laquelle M. O'Connor devait \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des postes vis\u00e9s par les restrictions de la CSPAAT est-elle une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne? M. O'Connor pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que la conclusion de l'arbitre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question de l'accommodement n'\u00e9tait pas essentielle \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive et, par cons\u00e9quent, qu'elle ne peut faire l'objet de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e.\n[30] \u00c0 mon avis, m\u00eame si l'arbitre n'a pas caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 les questions de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que M. O'Connor l'a fait dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et n'a pas utilis\u00e9 la m\u00eame terminologie que le Tribunal utiliserait lors de son analyse de la plainte, l'arbitre a trait\u00e9 essentiellement des m\u00eames questions qui seraient soulev\u00e9es lors d'une instruction par le Tribunal. Comme la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Rasanen c. Rosemount Instruments Ltd. (1994), 112 D.L.R. (4th) 683, \u00e0 la page 703, une caract\u00e9risation diff\u00e9rente des questions et de la proc\u00e9dure d'analyse de ces questions ne signifie pas n\u00e9cessairement qu'il s'agit de questions diff\u00e9rentes. (Voir \u00e9galement Barter c. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, 2003 BCHRT 9, au paragraphe 45).\n[31] Deux questions principales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es au cours de l'arbitrage : (1) la question de savoir si M. O'Connor avait \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 d'exercer ses droits d'anciennet\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus par la convention collective; (2) la question de savoir si le CN avait omis de respecter son obligation l\u00e9gale pr\u00e9vue par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne d'offrir un accommodement \u00e0 M. O'Connor.\n[32] Dans sa plainte, M. O'Connor d\u00e9clare que le CN a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit de la discrimination du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience en lui refusant la possibilit\u00e9 de reprendre son poste initial et en omettant de lui offrir un accommodement. Ainsi, sauf quant \u00e0 la mention de la convention collective, les questions dans les deux instances sont formul\u00e9es en des termes similaires.\n[33] Les questions pr\u00e9cises trait\u00e9es par l'arbitre pour tirer sa conclusion \u00e9taient-elles suffisamment similaires \u00e0 celles qui seraient trait\u00e9es par le Tribunal pour satisfaire \u00e0 ce volet du crit\u00e8re? Il est utile, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, d'\u00e9noncer les questions que le Tribunal examinerait en analysant la plainte et ensuite de les comparer aux questions trait\u00e9es par l'arbitre dans ses motifs.\n[34] Lors d'une audience devant le Tribunal, il appartiendrait d'abord \u00e0 M. O'Connor d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire par le CN et que sa d\u00e9ficience, ou sa d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, \u00e9tait un facteur du traitement discriminatoire subi. Il appartiendrait ensuite au CN de pr\u00e9senter une preuve digne de foi pour expliquer que sa conduite n'\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, une des d\u00e9fenses que pourrait invoquer le CN serait une preuve que ses actions \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ). Pour ce faire, le CN devrait \u00e9tablir ce qui suit :\nLe CN a adopt\u00e9 la norme \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de l'emploi;\nle CN a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant honn\u00eatement et de bonne foi que cela \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour l'ex\u00e9cution de ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; la norme \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'accomplissement de ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail du fait qu'il \u00e9tait impossible de composer avec des employ\u00e9s ayant les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que M. O'Connor sans que le CN subisse une contrainte excessive (C.B. (P.S.E.R.C.) c. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin).\n[35] Le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal, pour \u00e9tablir si les mesures d'accommodement constituent une contrainte excessive, examinera les facteurs en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9, de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de co\u00fbts se rapportant \u00e0 ces mesures.\n[36] Le Tribunal examinera de plus l'\u00e9tendue \u00e0 laquelle le plaignant a coop\u00e9r\u00e9 aux efforts de l'employeur pour lui offrir un accommodement quant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les employ\u00e9s sont tenus d'accepter des offres d'accommodement raisonnables. De plus, l'employeur s'acquitte de son obligation si une proposition qui serait raisonnable compte tenu de toutes les circonstances est refus\u00e9e (Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, au paragraphe 44).\n[37] Examinons maintenant la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre est compatible avec cette analyse. Au d\u00e9but de ses motifs, l'arbitre reconna\u00eet qu'il y avait une contradiction entre la preuve m\u00e9dicale signalant l'aptitude de M. O'Connor \u00e0 travailler sans restrictions et les restrictions pr\u00e9tendument immuables de la CSPAAT. Ainsi, je pense que l'arbitre a reconnu tacitement soit que M. O'Connor ne souffrait pas d'une d\u00e9ficience, mais qu'il \u00e9tait trait\u00e9 par le CN comme s'il souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience, soit qu'il souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience et qu'on lui refusait le droit de reprendre son poste initial en raison de cette d\u00e9ficience. Je pense qu'il est clair dans les motifs de l'arbitre qu'il a reconnu que dans un cas comme dans l'autre, le CN devait justifier son exigence voulant que soient lev\u00e9es les restrictions de la CSPAAT concernant M. O'Connor.\n[38] \u00c0 cet effet, l'arbitre a examin\u00e9 les cons\u00e9quences du refus d'accepter les restrictions de la CSPAAT et de simplement redonner \u00e0 M. O'Connor son poste initial. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que si le CN agissait ainsi, il serait toujours tenu, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la CSPAAT, de lui payer sa pension d'IPP \u00e9tablie \u00e0 20 pour 100 en plus de sa pleine r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. L'arbitre a mentionn\u00e9, \u00e0 un certain point dans sa d\u00e9cision, que le CN avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pay\u00e9 \u00e0 M. O'Connor des centaines de milliers de dollars pour de la r\u00e9adaptation, une nouvelle formation et des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre pr\u00e9voit implicitement que si M. O'Connor ne souffrait pas d'une d\u00e9ficience, l'employeur avait fourni une raison valable quant au motif pour lequel il ne pouvait pas lui redonner son poste initial, \u00e0 savoir : Le CN \u00e9tait li\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision de la CSPAAT et par cons\u00e9quent il serait tenu de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. O'Connor qui tenait compte de ses restrictions et de payer la pension d'IPP. Il \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable de s'attendre \u00e0 ce que l'employeur paie une pleine r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et une pension d'IPP.\n[39] L'arbitre a en outre examin\u00e9 les cons\u00e9quences de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. O'Connor en lui redonnant son poste initial si en fait il souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience suivant la d\u00e9cision de la CSPAAT. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que de fa\u00e7on compr\u00e9hensible le CN \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que M. O'Connor pourrait se blesser de nouveau si on lui redonnait son poste initial. Le CN serait alors expos\u00e9 \u00e0 des co\u00fbts de compensation r\u00e9sultant d'une nouvelle blessure. En outre, il y avait la question de savoir si l'utilisation de m\u00e9dicaments contre la douleur par M. O'Connor aurait un effet sur sa capacit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter son travail de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'arbitre a conclu qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas possible pour le CN de redonner \u00e0 M. O'Connor son poste initial.\n[40] Finalement, l'arbitre a ensuite examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si le CN s'\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. O'Connor quant aux restrictions impos\u00e9es par la CSPAAT. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agissait simplement pas d'un cas pour lequel la compagnie avait agi de mauvaise foi ou avait tent\u00e9 de se soustraire \u00e0 son obligation de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. O'Connor quant \u00e0 un emploi appropri\u00e9. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que deux postes compatibles avec les restrictions de travail impos\u00e9es \u00e0 M. O'Connor avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts \u00e0 ce dernier. Cependant, M. O'Connor a refus\u00e9 ces postes parce qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e0 Capreol (Ontario) o\u00f9 il vivait. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a conclu que M. O'Connor ne s'\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation pr\u00e9vue par la loi de participer au processus d'accommodement.\n[41] \u00c0 mon avis, m\u00eame si l'arbitre n'a pas explicitement mentionn\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l'analyse et les conclusions se rapportant \u00e0 chacune des \u00e9tapes de l'application de ce crit\u00e8re sont tous pr\u00e9sents dans ses motifs. La premi\u00e8re partie de l'analyse consiste \u00e0 savoir si l'exigence voulant que soient lev\u00e9es les restrictions de la CSPAAT se rapportant \u00e0 M. O'Connor avait un lien rationnel avec l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions et \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire relativement \u00e0 l'emploi. Les conclusions de l'arbitre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des cons\u00e9quences sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la sant\u00e9 qui r\u00e9sultent du fait de ne pas respecter les restrictions impos\u00e9es par la CSPAAT sembleraient traiter de ces questions puisque l'arbitre a reconnu que le CN avait des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes selon lesquelles s'il ne tenait pas compte des restrictions, il y avait un risque d'une nouvelle blessure. En outre, il y avait la question de l'effet des m\u00e9dicaments contre la douleur sur l'ex\u00e9cution de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire du travail.\n[42] La deuxi\u00e8me partie du crit\u00e8re traite de la question de savoir si le CN pouvait offrir un accommodement \u00e0 M. O'Connor m\u00eame s'il n'avait pas satisfait \u00e0 l'exigence voulant que soient lev\u00e9es les restrictions. Les conclusions de l'arbitre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des cons\u00e9quences quant aux co\u00fbts de m\u00eame que les questions de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 se rapportant au fait de redonner \u00e0 M. O'Connor son poste initial portent sur la question de l'accommodement cr\u00e9ant une contrainte excessive. \u00c0 mon avis, il est implicite dans les motifs de l'arbitre qu'il pensait que cela cr\u00e9erait une contrainte excessive pour le CN que d'offrir un accommodement \u00e0 M. O'Connor en lui redonnant son poste initial s'il \u00e9tait encore soumis aux restrictions de la CSPAAT. Il s'agit de la m\u00eame question que le Tribunal aurait \u00e0 trancher.\n[43] En outre, l'analyse de l'arbitre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des efforts faits par le CN pour offrir un accommodement \u00e0 M. O'Connor en lui proposant des postes vis\u00e9s par les restrictions de la CSPAAT comportait un examen des facteurs que le Tribunal examinerait. Ces facteurs incluent l'existence d'un travail o\u00f9 M. O'Connor habite, l'\u00e9tendue de la participation de M. O'Connor au processus et le co\u00fbt total des efforts d'accommodement. La conclusion de l'arbitre selon laquelle M. O'Connor ne s'\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation d'accepter une offre d'accommodement raisonnable fait carr\u00e9ment partie de l'analyse qui serait entreprise par le Tribunal. Finalement, la conclusion de l'arbitre selon laquelle le CN n'avait pas manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation d'offrir un accommodement \u00e0 M. O'Connor traite directement d'une question qui serait soulev\u00e9e lors de l'instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal.\n[44] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, on ne peut pas dire que l'arbitre a omis de traiter de quelque question essentielle de l'analyse en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. On ne peut pas dire non plus que la question de l'accommodement de M. O'Connor par le CN ait \u00e9t\u00e9 accessoire dans la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre. \u00c0 mon avis, la conclusion de l'arbitre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'accommodement faisait partie int\u00e9grante de sa d\u00e9cision.\n[45] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, je conclus que les questions soulev\u00e9es lors de l'arbitrage \u00e9taient les m\u00eames que celles qui seraient examin\u00e9es lors d'une audience devant le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, la premi\u00e8re condition du crit\u00e8re d'application de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie.\n(ii) D\u00e9cision judiciaire d\u00e9finitive [46] Il semble bien \u00e9tabli que, aux fins de la deuxi\u00e8me condition d'application du crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, les d\u00e9cisions arbitrales constituent des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires (voir par exemple Scotia Realty Ltd. And Olympia & York SP Corporation and Campeau Corporation (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 414; Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, [2002] D.C.D.P. no 22, au paragraphe 28, confirm\u00e9e par 2005 CAF 311). En outre, la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre ne fait pas l'objet d'un appel et, ainsi, elle est d\u00e9finitive. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette condition du crit\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie.\n(iii) Les parties, ou leurs ayants droit, sont les m\u00eames [47] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, comme dans l'affaire Smith, J. c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux, 2005 TCDP 22, les parties \u00e0 l'arbitrage ne sont clairement pas les m\u00eames que les parties devant le Tribunal. Cependant, lorsque les parties \u00e0 l'instance ne sont pas les m\u00eames, cette condition du crit\u00e8re peut quand m\u00eame \u00eatre remplie si une des parties \u00e9tait l'ayant droit d'une autre partie dans l'instance ant\u00e9rieure.\n[48] Il doit y avoir, pour qu'il s'agisse d'un ayant droit, un degr\u00e9 suffisant d'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun entre la partie et l'ayant droit pour qu'il soit juste que la partie soit li\u00e9e par les d\u00e9cisions rendues dans l'instance ant\u00e9rieure. (Arr\u00eat Danyluk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 60). Des d\u00e9cisions sur la question de savoir s'il y a un degr\u00e9 suffisant d'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun ou mutuel pour dire qu'une partie \u00e9tait l'ayant droit d'une autre partie doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es au cas par cas (Smith, J. c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 28).\n[49] Dans la d\u00e9cision Smith c. CN, j'ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'est pas possible de dire que dans tous les cas le syndicat et le plaignant ont une connexit\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats. Chaque situation doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e au cas par cas afin d'\u00e9tablir si le syndicat et le plaignant ont des int\u00e9r\u00eats suffisamment similaires quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du conflit pour conclure qu'ils sont les ayants droit l'un de l'autre.\n[50] Contrairement \u00e0 l'affaire Smith, je ne vois rien au dossier indiquant que le syndicat et M. O'Connor avaient des int\u00e9r\u00eats divergents quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du grief. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que la possibilit\u00e9 pour M. O'Connor de faire valoir ses propres int\u00e9r\u00eats ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on entrav\u00e9e par la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle le syndicat s'est occup\u00e9 de son grief. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, rien n'indique qu'il n'a pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 de fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou de pr\u00e9senter des observations pour son propre compte. Par cons\u00e9quent, aux fins de cette condition du crit\u00e8re, je conclus que le syndicat et M. O'Connor \u00e9taient les ayants droit l'un de l'autre.\n[51] Cependant, cela ne met pas fin \u00e0 l'analyse. La participation de la Commission \u00e0 l'instance doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre examin\u00e9e. La Commission n'\u00e9tait pas une partie au processus de grief, mais elle soutient que m\u00eame si elle ne compara\u00eetra pas ou ne pr\u00e9sentera pas d'observations lors de l'audience devant le Tribunal, elle demeure une partie \u00e0 l'instance devant le Tribunal. Bien que la Commission ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, ces observations se limitaient \u00e0 la question de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal.\n[52] Peut-on dire que la Commission avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l'arbitrage? Pour qu'on puisse le dire, il faudrait que je tire une conclusion selon laquelle le syndicat et la Commission ont une connexit\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats. \u00c0 mon avis, une telle conclusion ne peut pas \u00eatre tir\u00e9e. La connexit\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats n\u00e9cessaire n'existe simplement pas. Le r\u00f4le du syndicat lors d'arbitrage consiste \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter les int\u00e9r\u00eats du plaignant et des membres de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation. Le r\u00f4le de la Commission lors d'une instance devant le Tribunal consiste \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Il est possible de pr\u00e9tendre, compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas participer \u00e0 l'audience devant le Tribunal, que th\u00e9oriquement la Commission \u00e9tait un ayant droit quant \u00e0 l'arbitrage. \u00c0 mon avis, cependant, il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une pr\u00e9tention exag\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[53] Je pense que la meilleure m\u00e9thode \u00e0 adopter est une m\u00e9thode fond\u00e9e sur l'objectif vis\u00e9. Comme le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Toth c. Kitchener Aero Avionics, 2005 TCDP 19, au paragraphe 16, l'objectif vis\u00e9 par la question de savoir si la Commission est une partie dans le contexte d'une requ\u00eate portant sur la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e consiste surtout \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si une partie a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de la possibilit\u00e9 de traiter des questions en litige dans l'affaire. Compte tenu de l'intention d\u00e9clar\u00e9e de la Commission de ne pas participer \u00e0 l'audience, je ne vois pas comment elle pourrait par la suite pr\u00e9tendre qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de la possibilit\u00e9 de traiter des questions en litige dans l'affaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, j'estime que, aux fins de l'objectif vis\u00e9 par la question de savoir si la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'applique, la Commission n'est pas une partie \u00e0 l'instance devant le Tribunal.\n[54] Il r\u00e9sulte de ma conclusion selon laquelle le syndicat et M. O'Connor sont des ayants droit que les parties ou leurs ayants droit sont les m\u00eames que dans l'arbitrage.\n[55] En raison de cette analyse, je conclus que les trois conditions d'application de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies. Cependant, dans des cas comme dans la pr\u00e9sente situation et dans l'affaire Cremasco, o\u00f9 il est plus difficile de dire avec certitude que la condition quant \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 des parties a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9 d'examiner la doctrine de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nE. L'abus de proc\u00e9dure [56] Le CN pr\u00e9tend que si le Tribunal conclut que les conditions d'application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies, il devrait conclure que ce serait un abus de proc\u00e9dure que de permettre \u00e0 M. O'Connor de d\u00e9battre de nouveau des questions qui \u00e9t\u00e9 ont tranch\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on concluante par un arbitre.\n[57] Dans l'arr\u00eat Toronto (Ville) c. S.C.F.P., section locale 79, [2003] 3 R.C.S. 77, au paragraphe 37, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a statu\u00e9 que la doctrine de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure est utilis\u00e9e correctement pour emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9ouverture de litiges dans des circonstances o\u00f9 les exigences strictes de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e (g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les exigences de lien de droit et de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9) n'\u00e9taient pas remplies, mais o\u00f9 la r\u00e9ouverture aurait n\u00e9anmoins port\u00e9 atteinte aux principes d'\u00e9conomie, de coh\u00e9rence, de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et d'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l'administration de la justice.\n[58] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 le pouvoir du Tribunal d'examiner la question de savoir si la doctrine de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure s'applique aux faits particuliers d'une affaire (Cremasco, au paragraphe 41). Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette doctrine a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 succinctement par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Cremasco, au paragraphe 81. Le Tribunal doit se poser la question suivante : Est-il juste d'aller de l'avant?. Dans la d\u00e9cision Cremasco, le Tribunal a expliqu\u00e9 que le public per\u00e7oit le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne comme une partie int\u00e9grante du syst\u00e8me judiciaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, si la r\u00e9putation du syst\u00e8me plus large doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9serv\u00e9e, on doit se demander si, selon les gens raisonnables et renseign\u00e9s, mais ordinaires, il serait juste d'aller de l'avant quant \u00e0 la plainte.\n[59] Rien au dossier n'indique que les circonstances dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ont chang\u00e9 ou qu'un nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pertinent quant \u00e0 la question de l'accommodement pour M. O'Connor est maintenant disponible. Rien non plus ne donne \u00e0 penser que le grief \u00e9tait entach\u00e9 de quelque fraude, malhonn\u00eatet\u00e9 ou injustice.\n[60] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, une personne raisonnable et renseign\u00e9e poss\u00e9dant une compr\u00e9hension intuitive de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 dirait que M. O'Connor a eu l'occasion de se faire entendre par la cour, pour utiliser l'expression famili\u00e8re. Comme le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Cremasco, au paragraphe 96, il serait contre-indiqu\u00e9 de tenir une audience, avec tous les inconv\u00e9nients et les frais associ\u00e9s, lorsque l'affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on concluante par l'arbitre.\nF. Les facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires [61] J'ai conclu que les conditions d'application tant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies. Toutefois, il reste la question de savoir si je dois exercer mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser d'appliquer les doctrines dans les circonstances de l'affaire. Les facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires qui s'appliquent pour emp\u00eacher que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'applique d'une fa\u00e7on injuste ou in\u00e9quitable existent \u00e9galement pour emp\u00eacher que l'application de la doctrine de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure m\u00e8ne au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat ind\u00e9sirable (Ville de Toronto, au paragraphe 53).\n[62] Le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on compatible avec les faits particuliers de chaque affaire. La liste des facteurs qui peuvent \u00eatre pris en compte n'est pas limitative. Dans toutes les affaires, l'objectif est de s'assurer que l'application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e favorise la bonne administration de la justice, mais non au d\u00e9triment d'une v\u00e9ritable injustice dans l'affaire particuli\u00e8re (arr\u00eat Danyluk, au paragraphe 63).\n[63] Les facteurs suivants devraient \u00eatre pris en compte dans l'exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal :\nLe libell\u00e9 du texte de loi; l'objet de la loi; l'existence d'un droit d'appel; les garanties offertes aux parties dans le cadre de l'instance administrative; l'expertise du d\u00e9cideur; les circonstances ayant donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 l'instance administrative initiale; le risque d'injustice.\n[64] Le Code canadien du travail, qui \u00e9tablit le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends dans les lieux de travail r\u00e9gis par les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, pr\u00e9voit que les diff\u00e9rends doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9s d'une fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive (Code canadien du travail, L.R.C. 1985, ch. L-2, art. 57). Le Bureau d'arbitrage des chemins de fer du Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 afin de s'assurer de l'atteinte de cet objectif. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il semble que l'arbitre avait \u00e0 sa disposition de nombreuses mesures proc\u00e9durales, comme le pouvoir d'assigner des t\u00e9moins, de faire pr\u00eater serment, d'entendre de la preuve, d'ordonner la production de documents, d'entendre des observations de vive voix et de recevoir des observations \u00e9crites et de rendre des d\u00e9cisions int\u00e9rimaires. Il semble en outre que le syndicat de M. O'Connor l'appuyait totalement. M. O'Connor n'a soulev\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9occupation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l'instance.\n[65] En outre, il n'y a pas de doute que l'arbitre a beaucoup d'exp\u00e9rience dans les domaines des relations de travail et des droits de la personne au Canada et qu'il conna\u00eet tr\u00e8s bien ces domaines. Il conna\u00eet \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s bien les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l'environnement de travail au CN. Bien que la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre soit sujette \u00e0 une clause restrictive dans le Code canadien du travail, les parties peuvent toujours pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une demande de contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre si elles croient que des erreurs graves ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commises (article 58 du Code canadien du travail). Une telle demande n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[66] \u00c0 mon avis, les circonstances de l'affaire ne soul\u00e8vent aucune pr\u00e9occupation quant \u00e0 un risque d'injustice. M. O'Connor a eu une audience \u00e9quitable devant un arbitre exp\u00e9riment\u00e9. Bien qu'il ait soulev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'interpr\u00e9tation que faisait l'arbitre quant \u00e0 la loi en mati\u00e8re d'indemnisation des accident\u00e9s du travail qui s'appliquait, je ne vois aucune preuve d'erreur grave qui entra\u00eenerait un d\u00e9ni de justice.\n[67] Finalement, au moment de l'audience relative \u00e0 l'arbitrage, M. O'Connor recevait une pension d'invalidit\u00e9. Il voulait reprendre son poste initial, ce qui aurait entra\u00een\u00e9 pour lui une pleine r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en plus de la pension d'invalidit\u00e9. Il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir ce r\u00e9sultat. Le CN, cependant, a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 offrir \u00e0 M. O'Connor du travail qui respectait les restrictions de la CSPAAT.\n[68] Selon son Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, M. O'Connor est actuellement un employ\u00e9 du CN \u00e0 titre de signaleur \u00e0 Mimico (Ontario). En outre, il continue \u00e0 recevoir une pension d'invalidit\u00e9. Il peut, s'il r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 faire lever les restrictions impos\u00e9es, tenter d'obtenir son poste initial.\n[69] Compte tenu de toutes ces consid\u00e9rations, je conclus qu'il n'y a pas de motifs convaincants d'exercer mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser d'appliquer la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ou la doctrine de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nIV. ORDONNANCE [70] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, la requ\u00eate du CN est accueillie. La plainte de M. O'Connor d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada est par la pr\u00e9sente rejet\u00e9e.\nKaren A.

LE REDRESSEMENT 41\nI. \u00c0 QUEL SUJET LA PLAINTE A-T-ELLE \u00c9T\u00c9 D\u00c9POS\u00c9E? [1] La pr\u00e9sente plainte porte sur la question de savoir si Peter Kouba, sous les pseudonymes proud18 et WhiteEuroCanadian, a diffus\u00e9 des messages haineux sur Internet, et ce, en contravention du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[2] Le 8 juin 2004, Richard Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) all\u00e9guant que, entre le 7 octobre 2003 et juin 2004, ainsi que par la suite, Peter Kouba a diffus\u00e9 des documents sur deux sites Internet - www.stormfront.org (stormfront.org) et www.westerncanadaforus.com - qui exposaient les gais, les lesbiennes, les Musulmans, les Hindous, les Juifs, les Premi\u00e8res nations, les personnes d'Asie de l'Est, les Pakistanais, les Roms (mieux connus sous le nom de gitans) et d'autres non-Blancs, \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n[3] L'intim\u00e9 a ni\u00e9 avoir diffus\u00e9 les messages en litige. Il a pr\u00e9tendu qu'on a fait passer les messages litigieux comme \u00e9tant les siens. Il pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement qu'il n'est pas le genre de personne \u00e0 diffuser des documents qui exposeraient des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n[4] En plus de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en rapport avec les messages haineux, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) et le plaignant ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en rapport avec l'identit\u00e9 de la personne qui a diffus\u00e9 ces messages.\n[5] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au cours de l'audience de la pr\u00e9sente plainte violent l'article 13 de la Loi. Je conclus \u00e9galement que c'est l'intim\u00e9, Peter Kouba, sous les pseudonymes proud18 et WhiteEuroCanadian qui a diffus\u00e9 les documents en litige sur Internet.\nII. QUELLES SONT LES CIRCONSTANCES QUI ONT MEN\u00c9 AU D\u00c9P\u00d4T DE LA PLAINTE? [6] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, depuis la fin des ann\u00e9es 90, il s'int\u00e9resse \u00e0 la question des droits de la personne, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la diffusion de messages haineux par les personnes qui souscrivent aux th\u00e8ses des n\u00e9onazis et des tenants de la supr\u00e9matie blanche. Cet int\u00e9r\u00eat l'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 parcourir Internet afin de voir s'il n'y figurait pas des documents qui, selon lui, constituent de la propagande haineuse.\n[7] En parcourant Internet en 2003, le plaignant a d\u00e9couvert, par hasard, des documents, sur un site Web se trouvant \u00e0 l'adresse www.stormfront.org, qui semblaient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s par une personne qui vivait \u00e0 Edmonton (Alberta). Cette personne se servait du pseudonyme proud18.\n[8] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que stormfront.org est un site Web international am\u00e9ricain. Il comprend des groupes de discussion, lesquels sont des sites Internet o\u00f9 des personnes de partout dans le monde peuvent \u00e9changer en direct sur des questions qui ont trait \u00e0 la supr\u00e9matie blanche et \u00e0 l'id\u00e9ologie n\u00e9onazie. Certains groupes de discussion figurant dans stormfront.org sont consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 un pays en particulier. Les documents diffus\u00e9s par proud18 figuraient dans le groupe de discussion canadien de stormfront.org.\n[9] Dans un groupe de discussion on trouve des sujets de discussion appel\u00e9s fils de discussion. Les fils de discussion sont class\u00e9s par ordre chronologique et c'est le fil de discussion dans lequel se trouve le message le plus r\u00e9cent, connu \u00e9galement sous le nom d'article de discussion, qui figure au haut de la liste. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les membres du public pouvaient lire les articles affich\u00e9s dans les fils de discussion figurant dans le groupe de discussion canadien de stormfront.org.\n[10] Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'automne 2003, pour un certain nombre de raisons, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par les documents qui \u00e9taient affich\u00e9s par proud18 dans le groupe de discussion canadien de stormfront.org. Premi\u00e8rement, les propos tenus par cet individu sur les Canadiens d'origine autochtone, la communaut\u00e9 juive, les homosexuels et les autres groupes minoritaires, \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gatifs et tr\u00e8s mena\u00e7ants. Dans les r\u00e9ponses aux messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 dans le groupe de discussion, on appelait au g\u00e9nocide de certains groupes, comme les homosexuels et les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience mentale. De plus, les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 portaient \u00e0 croire que leur auteur faisait partie d'un groupe connu sous le nom de Western Canada For Us (WCFU), lequel groupe projetait de tenir, en Alberta, des \u00e9v\u00e8nements \u00e0 th\u00e8me n\u00e9onazi et \u00e0 th\u00e8me supr\u00e9matie blanche.\n[11] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, en f\u00e9vrier 2004, il est devenu \u00e9vident que WCFU \u00e9tait en train de cr\u00e9er un site Web. En mars 2004, le plaignant a consult\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois sur Internet le site Web de WCFU. Dans une page de la section Groupe de discussion de ce site Web, le plaignant a vu ce qui \u00e9tait, selon lui, des messages haineux dirig\u00e9s contre les homosexuels et les lesbiennes. Ces documents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s par une personne se servant du pseudonyme WhiteEuroCanadian et celle-ci faisait office de mod\u00e9rateur. Selon le plaignant, WhiteEuroCanadian \u00e9tait la m\u00eame personne qui se faisait appeler proud18 sur le site Web stormfront.org. Toujours selon le plaignant, cette personne \u00e9tait l'intim\u00e9, Peter Kouba. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les messages affich\u00e9s dans le groupe de discussion de WCFU pouvaient \u00eatre consult\u00e9s par n'importe qui, qu'il soit membre ou non de Western Canada For Us.\n[12] Le plaignant a fait part de ses inqui\u00e9tudes \u00e0 propos des messages affich\u00e9s sur les sites Web stormfront.org et WCFU \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 des crimes haineux du service de police d'Edmonton, puis, en juin 2004, il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\nIII. QUI A COMPARU \u00c0 L'AUDIENCE? [13] La Commission a pleinement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audition de la plainte et elle \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement particip\u00e9 mais il n'\u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par aucun avocat. On se doit cependant de souligner qu'il est avocat par profession.\n[14] L'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent lors de la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d'audience. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l'audience, on a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit de signification mentionnant qu'on avait signifi\u00e9 personnellement \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 le 9 juin 2006 un avis de conf\u00e9rence de cas afin de discuter de l'audience qui aurait lieu, un avis du lieu de l'audience mentionnant le lieu pr\u00e9cis et les dates de l'audience ainsi qu'une lettre du Tribunal soulignant la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre lors de l'audience. Pour ce motif, je suis convaincu que, comme l'exige l'article 50 de la Loi, l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 amplement avis\u00e9 de la tenue de l'instruction sur la plainte. La premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d'audience s'est donc d\u00e9roul\u00e9e en l'absence de l'intim\u00e9.\n[15] L'intim\u00e9 a comparu lors de la deuxi\u00e8me journ\u00e9e d'audience. Il n'\u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par aucun avocat, ni par aucun repr\u00e9sentant. L'intim\u00e9 a contre-interrog\u00e9 le plaignant et a formul\u00e9 des observations dans son plaidoyer final. Il a toutefois choisi de ne pas t\u00e9moigner et de ne faire entendre aucun t\u00e9moin.\nIV. QUELLES SONT LES QUESTIONS QUE NOUS DEVONS TRANCHER EN L'ESP\u00c8CE? [16] Les trois questions suivantes doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce :\nLe Tribunal peut-il examiner des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte? Les documents en litige sont-ils susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable pour un motif de distinction illicite? L'intim\u00e9, Peter Kouba, a-t-il diffus\u00e9 les documents en litige?\nA. Question no 1 - Le Tribunal peut-il examiner des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte? [17] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, entre le 9 octobre 2003 et le 30 mars 2006, il a examin\u00e9 les documents figurant dans les sites Web stormfront.org et WCFU. Des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en juin 2004 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve de la violation continue de l'article 13 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans le formulaire de plainte. L'intim\u00e9 a su, gr\u00e2ce au formulaire de plainte, que des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s apr\u00e8s la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte seraient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve.\n[18] Avant la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d'audience, la Commission a tent\u00e9 de transmettre par courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 les documents diffus\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte mais elle a re\u00e7u un message l'avisant que le syst\u00e8me de courrier \u00e9lectronique de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait incapable de recevoir les documents. Les documents ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 par la poste et il a re\u00e7u une copie de ceux-ci lorsqu'il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience le deuxi\u00e8me jour.\n[19] Bien que l'intim\u00e9 ait ni\u00e9 avoir diffus\u00e9 les documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, il ne s'est pas oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 leur production au motif qu'il aurait re\u00e7u un avis insuffisant de la production de ces documents. Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu que la preuve a trait \u00e0 la nature continue des pr\u00e9tendues violations de la Loi et compte tenu du fait que l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce au formulaire de plainte et \u00e0 la divulgation des documents que des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires seraient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s durant l'audience, je conclus que le Tribunal peut tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\nB. Question no 2 - Les documents en litige sont-ils susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les membres du groupe identifiable? [20] L'article 13 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour une personne, de diffuser au moyen d'Internet des documents susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable pour un motif de distinction illicite.\n[21] Le mot haine a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini comme \u00e9tant une malice extr\u00eame, une \u00e9motion qui n'admet chez la personne vis\u00e9e aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te ses d\u00e9fauts. Le mot m\u00e9pris sugg\u00e8re le processus mental consistant \u00e0 regarder quelqu'un de haut ou \u00e0 le traiter comme inf\u00e9rieur (Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892, paragraphes 60 et 61). Des documents sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres d'un groupe identifiable \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris si, selon toute vraisemblance, leur diffusion rend les membres du groupe identifiable susceptibles d'\u00eatre soumis \u00e0 une malice extr\u00eame ou si elle cr\u00e9e un climat propice \u00e0 la fomentation de la haine et du m\u00e9pris (Citron c. Zundel, (No 4) (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/274, paragraphe 134).\n[22] Une analyse des d\u00e9cisions de plus en plus nombreuses portant sur l'article 13 r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il existe un certain nombre de documents comportant certains th\u00e8mes distinctifs qui, selon toute vraisemblance, sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres d'un groupe identifiable \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. Il serait utile, \u00e0 ce stade-ci, de fournir une liste de ces th\u00e8mes distinctifs ainsi que certains exemples tir\u00e9s de la jurisprudence afin d'illustrer chaque point. La liste est loin d'\u00eatre compl\u00e8te. Elle peut, cependant, fournir un contexte utile pour la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision juridique.\n[23] Apr\u00e8s chacune des mentions des th\u00e8mes distinctifs, une description et une analyse des documents en l'esp\u00e8ce qui pr\u00e9sentent les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques sont fournies. Il convient de souligner qu'un nombre important des messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve au cours de l'audience. Plusieurs d'entre eux \u00e9taient trop longs pour \u00eatre reproduits dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ai fourni dans mon analyse des descriptions ainsi que de courts extraits des messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 et WhiteEuroCanadian. Des d\u00e9tails additionnels ainsi que le contenu des messages figurent \u00e0 l'annexe A de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n(i) Les th\u00e8mes distinctifs des messages haineux a) Le groupe identifiable est d\u00e9crit comme constituant une puissante menace qui prend le contr\u00f4le des principales institutions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui prive les autres de leur gagne-pain, de leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de leur libert\u00e9 de parole et de leur bien-\u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. [24] Le th\u00e8me de la puissante menace est un th\u00e8me qui se d\u00e9gage dans les causes o\u00f9 les Juifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible de messages haineux. Par exemple, dans la d\u00e9cision Citron c. Zundel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, on expliquait dans les messages en litige la th\u00e9orie selon laquelle les Juifs conspirent en secret en vue d'extorquer de l'argent, d'acqu\u00e9rir un immense pouvoir et d'exercer un contr\u00f4le \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle internationale. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, on affirmait que les Juifs avaient invent\u00e9 l'histoire de l'Holocauste perp\u00e9tr\u00e9 par les Nazis, et ce, afin d'extorquer des milliards de dollars aux diff\u00e9rents pays \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9paration. Les Juifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9s de menteurs, d'escrocs, de combinards et d'extorqueurs. Le Tribunal a conclu que ces messages cr\u00e9aient un climat propice \u00e0 la fomentation de la haine et du m\u00e9pris envers les Juifs car ils encourageaient les gens \u00e0 les consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant des menteurs, des tricheurs, des criminels et des escrocs (Zundel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 140).\n[25] La qualification du groupe identifiable comme constituant une puissante menace figure \u00e9galement dans la d\u00e9cision Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc. (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/453 dans laquelle les messages en litige pr\u00e9venaient les lecteurs que les homosexuels ont des intentions. Ces intentions consistaient \u00e0 l\u00e9galiser la p\u00e9dophilie (Schnell, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 36). Une fois de plus, on laissait entendre que sans qu'il ne s'en rende compte, le public canadien avait \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 par la ruse \u00e0 permettre que ses enfants deviennent des victimes. Le Tribunal a conclu que cela cr\u00e9ait un climat propice \u00e0 la fomentation de la haine et du m\u00e9pris.\nLes documents en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent-ils le th\u00e8me de la puissante menace?\n[26] Les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 sur stormfront.org \u00e0 propos des Canadiens d'origine autochtone v\u00e9hiculent le th\u00e8me de la puissante menace. Ils accusent les membres de ce groupe d'extorquer des milliards de dollars aux contribuables canadiens et de revendiquer des titres sur des terres qui ne leur ont jamais appartenu. Ils pr\u00e9viennent les lecteurs de pas tomber dans le pi\u00e8ge du sentiment de culpabilit\u00e9 que leur ont tendu les Canadiens d'origine autochtone. Par exemple, dans un message affich\u00e9 le 7 octobre 2003 dans un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Si vous aimez les Sauvages, alors ne lisez pas ceci proud18 d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nMaintenant, si vous aimez les autochtones des bandes dessin\u00e9es alors ne lisez pas ce qui suit. Vous apprendrez jusqu'\u00e0 quel point ces Sauvages sont primitifs. Le Sauvage Phil Fontaine demande pr\u00e8s de 2 milliards de dollars de plus par ann\u00e9e pour 600 Premi\u00e8res nations [600? C'est le chiffre avanc\u00e9 par Ottawa. Une chose qui m'intrigue \u00e0 propos de ce chiffre, c'est que, il y a 150 ans, il n'y avait m\u00eame pas la moiti\u00e9 de ce chiffre]. Ces Sauvages se s\u00e9parent de leurs tribus pour en former d'autres. Puis, ils obtiennent un montant minimum de 100 millions de dollars et ainsi de suite[...]. Pourquoi devrions-nous financer ces nouvelles tribus d\u00e9tach\u00e9es?\nEn plus du montant approchant les 8 milliards de dollars par ann\u00e9e qu'ils re\u00e7oivent d\u00e9j\u00e0 afin, comme ils l'affirment, de le consacrer \u00e0 des programmes autochtones dans le but de s'acquitter de leurs obligations d\u00e9coulant des trait\u00e9s et de la Constitution.\nQuelles obligations?\nAu fil des ans, nous leur avons donn\u00e9 des centaines de MILLIARDS de dollars, des terres de premier ordre, des royaut\u00e9s, des exemptions d'imp\u00f4t, des prestations d'aide sociale \u00e0 vie en plus des sommes vers\u00e9es \u00e0 leurs r\u00e9serves.\nEt malgr\u00e9 cela, ils vivent comme des sauvages. Peut-\u00eatre qu'il y en a quelques uns qui sont d\u00e9cents [...] PEUT-\u00caTRE.\nEt un autre de ces Sauvages n'arr\u00eate pas de parler de combien d'argent de plus ils veulent.\nDes milliards de dollars gaspill\u00e9s. Donnez \u00e0 dix personnes BLANCHES instruites un milliard de dollars et regardez les empires se cr\u00e9er. Et ces Sauvages continuent de se plaindre du prix \u00e9lev\u00e9 du LYSOL.\n[27] Dans un message dat\u00e9 du 23 novembre 2003, proud18 pr\u00e9tend que l'extorsion d'argent faite par les Canadiens d'origine autochtone aux Canadiens de race blanche a entra\u00een\u00e9 l'effondrement des syst\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et d'\u00e9ducation au Canada.\n[28] De m\u00eame, les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 \u00e0 propos des Juifs refl\u00e8tent le th\u00e8me de la puissante menace qui est v\u00e9hicul\u00e9 dans d'autres messages haineux. Les Juifs contr\u00f4leraient cens\u00e9ment les m\u00e9dias, le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9ducation ainsi que nos gouvernements, exposant ainsi la population non juive \u00e0 de graves dangers. Le contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par les Juifs sur ces institutions serait cens\u00e9ment la raison pour laquelle les droits individuels sont brim\u00e9s. Par exemple, dans un message affich\u00e9 le 23 novembre 2003 dans un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Que faudra-t-il pour que nous agissions?, proud18 \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nNous avons tous nos petites histoires quant \u00e0 savoir comment les choses se sont d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9es dans notre voisinage. Nous avons de moins en moins de droits. Merde, nous sommes une esp\u00e8ce en voie de disparition. Les Blancs, en terme de population, sont la minorit\u00e9 la plus importante au monde. Les Juifs se sont empar\u00e9s de notre syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9ducation, de nos m\u00e9dias, de nos gouvernements, etc.\n[29] Comme d'autres messages v\u00e9hiculant ce th\u00e8me, les messages de proud18 \u00e0 propos des Canadiens d'origine autochtone et des Juifs tentent de susciter des sentiments d'indignation parce que l'on se fait voler et duper par un sinistre groupe de personnes. De cette fa\u00e7on, les messages v\u00e9hiculant ce th\u00e8me cr\u00e9ent un climat propice \u00e0 la fomentation de la haine et du m\u00e9pris contre les membres des groupes susmentionn\u00e9s.\nb) Dans les messages en litige on utilise des faits authentiques, des informations de presse, des photos et des propos provenant de sources cens\u00e9ment dignes de confiance pour faire des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 propos du groupe identifiable. [30] Les messages dans lesquels on utilise des faits cens\u00e9ment authentiques, des informations de presse, des photos et des propos provenant de sources cens\u00e9ment dignes de confiance dans le but de donner une apparence d'objectivit\u00e9 et de v\u00e9racit\u00e9 \u00e0 la description tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gative du groupe identifiable ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant susceptibles d'exposer les membres du groupe identifiable \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris. Ils encouragent les lecteurs \u00e0 accepter, telles quelles, les g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations grossi\u00e8res et les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 propos du groupe identifiable.\n[31] Par exemple, dans Warman c.Winnicki 2006 TCDP 20, l'intim\u00e9 s'\u00e9tait servi d'images photographiques montrant des corps br\u00fbl\u00e9s et d\u00e9membr\u00e9s d'Africains pour transmettre son message que lorsqu'un Africain vient vivre au Canada, il am\u00e8ne in\u00e9vitablement la violence et la mort. Le Tribunal a conclu que cela augmentait la probabilit\u00e9 que des membres de la communaut\u00e9 africaine soient expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris car les images montr\u00e9es suscitaient un fort sentiment de d\u00e9go\u00fbt (Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 90).\n[32] Dans cette m\u00eame affaire, l'intim\u00e9 a cit\u00e9 des extraits de bulletins de nouvelles en direct qui avaient trait \u00e0 des crimes et \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements impliquant des membres des groupes identifiables. Le Tribunal a conclu que l'utilisation par l'intim\u00e9 d'articles de journaux comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tayant ses d\u00e9clarations conf\u00e9rait un certain air de l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 \u00e0 ses messages. Selon le Tribunal, cela rendait les messages plus convaincants et augmentait la possibilit\u00e9 que ceux-ci exposent les membres du groupe identifiable \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris (Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 82).\nLes documents en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent-ils le th\u00e8me des faits authentiques?\n[33] Proud18 tente d'utiliser des faits authentiques ainsi que des informations de presse pour justifier la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation raciste sans fondement que, au Canada, la majorit\u00e9 des crimes sont commis par des Autochtones. Par exemple, dans un message dat\u00e9 du 11 f\u00e9vrier 2004, proud18 fait \u00e9tat d'un fait cens\u00e9ment authentique rapport\u00e9 dans les m\u00e9dias \u00e0 propos d'un Autochtone dont la peine pour meurtre aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite en appel. Proud18 conclut ce qui suit : [traduction] [...] si vous \u00eates un Sauvage, vous pouvez commettre un meurtre impun\u00e9ment tout simplement parce que vous \u00eates un Sauvage. Il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant que les Sauvages commettent la majorit\u00e9 des crimes au Canada. Ils jouissent de l'appui des tribunaux et ils en profitent. Le Canada a besoin d'\u00eatre sauv\u00e9 le plus t\u00f4t possible.\n[34] Dans un autre message affich\u00e9 sur stormfront.org le 30 novembre 2003, proud18 a lanc\u00e9 un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Indiens recherch\u00e9s pour le meurtre d'une femme \u00e2g\u00e9e de 70 ans. Le message fait \u00e9tat d'un reportage cens\u00e9ment authentique sur le cas d'une femme \u00e2g\u00e9e de 70 ans qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 assassin\u00e9e dans sa maison. Proud18 d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nLa police est \u00e0 la recherche de deux Sauvages [ce n'est rien de nouveau] qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vus en train de courir dans la ruelle pr\u00e8s de sa maison. Les m\u00e9decins ont peur de dire \u00e0 la m\u00e8re \u00e2g\u00e9e de 90 ans de la victime que sa fille a \u00e9t\u00e9 assassin\u00e9e parce qu'ils craignent que celle-ci meure de chagrin. Elle n'avait que sa fille pour toute compagne.\n[35] Proud18 tire les conclusions suivantes :\n[traduction]\nCela s'est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 Edmonton, le Sauvage des Prairies, selon moi, est plus du genre tueur et violeur que le Sauvage de l'Ontario. Mais, en fin de compte, ils sont tous des Sauvages.\n[36] Proud18 se sert \u00e9galement de reportages cens\u00e9ment authentiques pour transmettre un message n\u00e9gatif concernant les Noirs. Par exemple, dans un message affich\u00e9 le 30 novembre 2003 dans un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Deux Noirs violent des femmes blanches en s\u00e9rie, proud18 relate de la fa\u00e7on suivante un fait qui a cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9 dans les m\u00e9dias : [traduction] deux n\u00e8gres aux cr\u00e2nes ras\u00e9s ont viol\u00e9 des femmes dans le quartier Clearview. Cela am\u00e8ne proud18 \u00e0 se poser la question suivante : [traduction] Comment les d\u00e9put\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9raux peuvent-ils affirmer que la majorit\u00e9 des tueurs en s\u00e9rie sont des Blancs et que l'on ne peut m\u00eame pas affirmer publiquement que, au Canada, plus de 50 p. 100 des viols sont commis par des Noirs?.\n[37] Dans un message affich\u00e9 le 4 janvier 2004 sur stormfront.org, proud18 d\u00e9crit un reportage concernant les blessures graves qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 inflig\u00e9es et les d\u00e9c\u00e8s qui auraient eu lieu au cours d'une lutte de gangs \u00e0 laquelle auraient particip\u00e9 des Hindous. Selon le message affich\u00e9, le reportage mentionnait qu'une femme blanche faisait partie de l'un des gangs et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9e. Dans un autre message affich\u00e9 sur stormfront.org le 2 mai 2004, proud18 formule des observations quant \u00e0 une nouvelle parue dans les m\u00e9dias selon laquelle un Hindou aurait apparemment transmis le VIH\/sida \u00e0 trois femmes. Proud18 se sert de ces actualit\u00e9s pour faire valoir que les femmes blanches qui fr\u00e9quentent des Hindous trahissent notre race et m\u00e9ritent la mort.\n[38] L'utilisation par proud18 de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s faits authentiques afin de justifier des conclusions tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gatives concernant les membres des groupes identifiables constitue un moyen puissant d'exposer ceux-ci \u00e0 la haine parce que certains lecteurs croiront que les conclusions sont justifi\u00e9es compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fournis par les r\u00e9cits et les reportages. Les r\u00e9cits sont souvent anecdotiques et ne font \u00e9tat d'aucun d\u00e9tail quant au contexte ou quant \u00e0 l'historique qui pourrait att\u00e9nuer les incidences ou affaiblir les conclusions que l'on cherche \u00e0 tirer.\n[39] Dans de nombreux messages, proud18 encourage les lecteurs \u00e0 partager avec lui dans le groupe de discussion leurs r\u00e9cits et leurs exp\u00e9riences n\u00e9gatives concernant les Autochtones de telle sorte que les nationalistes blancs qui pouvaient avoir des sentiments favorables envers les Autochtones perdent ces sentiments. Il semble donc que le but vis\u00e9 par ces messages est d'exposer les membres du groupe identifiable \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\nc) Le groupe identifiable est d\u00e9crit comme un groupe qui s'en prend aux enfants, aux personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es, aux personnes vuln\u00e9rable, etc. [40] Dans Schnell, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, les messages faisaient \u00e9tat que les homosexuels et les lesbiennes tentaient d'attitrer les enfants afin d'abuser d'eux. De m\u00eame, dans Payzant et al. c. McAleer and Canadian Liberty Net, 26 C.H.R.R. D\/271, conf. par. 26 C.H.R.R. D\/280 (C.F. 1re inst.), les messages en litige \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que l'on associe p\u00e9dophilie et homosexualit\u00e9. Cela a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l'affichage d'un message dans lequel on demandait l'ex\u00e9cution des homosexuels. Le Tribunal a conclu que l'association entre p\u00e9dophilie et homosexualit\u00e9 provoquait chez la personne qui recevait les messages un sentiment de d\u00e9go\u00fbt envers les homosexuels, augmentant ainsi la possibilit\u00e9 que les personnes qui recevaient les messages estiment que l'ex\u00e9cution des homosexuels n'\u00e9tait pas une mauvaise id\u00e9e (Payzant et al, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 38).\n[41] Dans Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18, ont d\u00e9crivait de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9taill\u00e9e dans les messages en litige des tournages de films pornographiques comportant des sc\u00e8nes d'infliction de s\u00e9vices sexuels et de viols d'enfants, puis on pr\u00e9tendait que bien que les consommateurs de pornographie juv\u00e9nile ne sont pas tous Juifs, les Juifs sont en nombre disproportionn\u00e9 parmi eux (Warman c. Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphes 25 et 26). Le Tribunal a conclu que ces messages ne pouvaient servir qu'\u00e0 fomenter la haine contre les Juifs.\nLes documents en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent-ils le th\u00e8me du pr\u00e9dateur?\n[42] Certains des documents en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent le th\u00e8me du pr\u00e9dateur. Dans un message dat\u00e9 du 1er d\u00e9cembre 2003, proud18 d\u00e9crit les Noirs comme \u00e9tant des cannibales et des chasseurs de t\u00eate qui ont des relations sexuelles avec des animaux; et que, lorsqu'ils ne peuvent s'adonner \u00e0 cette activit\u00e9, violent des Blanches. Proud18 d\u00e9clare de fa\u00e7on sinistre \u00e0 la fin de ce message que [traduction] ce [Noir] d\u00e9m\u00e9nage \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez vous.\n[43] Les documents affich\u00e9s par WhiteEuroCanadian sur le site Web WCFU \u00e0 propos des homosexuels et des lesbiennes v\u00e9hiculent \u00e9galement le th\u00e8me du pr\u00e9dateur. Dans un message affich\u00e9 sur ce site Web le 9 mars 2004, WhiteEuroCanadian d\u00e9clare que les homosexuels [traduction] ne sont pas des \u00eatres humains, ils sont des pervers sexuels du m\u00eame genre que les p\u00e9dophiles, les personnes qui s'adonnent \u00e0 la bestialit\u00e9, les sadomasochistes, etc.. C'est en raison de leur pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e tendance \u00e0 s'attaquer aux enfants que WhiteEuroCanadian d\u00e9clare qu'il s'oppose \u00e0 ce que les homosexuels occupent des postes de [traduction] travailleur en garderie, de gardien d'enfants, d'enseignant, de patron, etc..\n[44] Tout comme les documents qui v\u00e9hiculent le th\u00e8me susmentionn\u00e9 dans d'autres cas de messages haineux, les documents en l'esp\u00e8ce qui qualifient les groupes identifiables de pr\u00e9dateurs sexuels exploitent la vive crainte qu'ont les gens que les enfants, les femmes et les personnes vuln\u00e9rables deviennent victimes des impulsions sexuelles violentes et criminelles des groupes identifiables. Cela rend les membres des groupes identifiables tr\u00e8s susceptibles d'\u00eatre expos\u00e9s \u00e0 de profonds sentiments de haine.\nd) Le groupe identifiable est tenu responsable des probl\u00e8mes actuels de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et du monde [45] Dans Warman c. Alexan Kulbashian et autres, 2006 TCDP 11, on fait mention d'un certain nombre de messages dans lesquels ont tient les Juifs et les musulmans responsables de la mort, le 11 septembre 2001, de milliers d'individus blancs au World Trade Center \u00e0 New York. Dans ces messages, on encourage les racistes \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des actes violents contre les membres des groupes susmentionn\u00e9s. Le Tribunal a conclu que, comme on associait dans les messages en litige les Juifs et les musulmans aux terroristes responsables des attentats du 11 septembre, ceux-ci exposaient incontestablement les membres des groupes susmentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine, au m\u00e9pris et \u00e0 un r\u00e9el danger physique en donnant \u00e0 penser que tous les membres de ces collectivit\u00e9s constituaient des cibles l\u00e9gitimes de violence punitive aveugle (Warman c. Kulbashian, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 55). Ces messages avaient \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7us pour tirer profit des sentiments pr\u00e9existants de col\u00e8re et de crainte ressentis au Canada apr\u00e8s les attentats.\n[46] Dans certains des messages en litige dans Taylor et le Western Guard Party c. la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, (1979), D.T. 1\/79, on faisait un lien entre l'int\u00e9gration des personnes de couleur dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne et le d\u00e9clin de la qualit\u00e9 des services de sant\u00e9. Le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que l'effet persuasif de ces messages \u00e9tait engendr\u00e9 par le fait qu'ils \u00e9tablissaient un lien entre le probl\u00e8me racial et un probl\u00e8me particulier au pays, ce qui pouvait avoir un effet n\u00e9faste sur les personnes qui recevaient les messages en question. De m\u00eame, dans cette affaire, on suscitait la haine ou le m\u00e9pris envers les Juifs en les tenant responsables du ch\u00f4mage, de l'inflation et de la menace croissante d'une troisi\u00e8me guerre mondiale, trois des probl\u00e8mes de notre monde qui \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque comme \u00e9tant des plus urgents.\nLes documents en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent-ils le th\u00e8me de la cause des probl\u00e8mes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9?\n[47] Dans les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 sur stormfront.org, on affirme que si les Autochtones cessaient de pomper l'\u00e9conomie canadienne de dizaines de milliards de dollars, les syst\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et d'\u00e9ducation au Canada se porteraient mieux. Dans ces messages, proud18 accusent \u00e9galement les Juifs de priver les Canadiens, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 leur pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 contr\u00f4le du syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9ducation, des m\u00e9dias et du gouvernement, de leur droit fondamental \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de parole. De m\u00eame, dans un message affich\u00e9 sur stormfront.org le 30 novembre 2003 et intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Les musulmanes transgressent nos lois proud18 affirme que, comme on permet aux musulmanes de se voiler en public, celles-ci peuvent commettre des actes de terrorisme anonyme comme, par exemple, tirer des grenades. Dans ce message, proud18 d\u00e9plore le fait que le gouvernement canadien tol\u00e8re la menace terroriste d\u00e9guis\u00e9e au Canada.\n[48] Dans ces messages, on fournit aux lecteurs des boucs \u00e9missaires pour les probl\u00e8mes du monde; on fournit un exutoire \u00e0 de fortes \u00e9motions n\u00e9gatives; on puise dans ces \u00e9motions et on les projette vers les groupes identifiables. De cette fa\u00e7on, on suscite et on l\u00e9gitime la haine envers les membres des groupes identifiables.\ne) Le groupe identifiable est d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant fonci\u00e8rement dangereux ou violent [49] Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9 a utilis\u00e9 des images photographiques saisissantes montrant des Africains br\u00fbl\u00e9s et \u00e9ventr\u00e9s pour transmettre son message que lorsqu'un Africain vient vivre au Canada, il apporte in\u00e9vitablement la violence et la mort. Le Tribunal a conclu que les images en question augmentaient la probabilit\u00e9 que les membres de la communaut\u00e9 africaine soit expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris car elles suscitaient un profond sentiment de d\u00e9go\u00fbt (Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 90).\nLes documents en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent-ils le th\u00e8me du fonci\u00e8rement dangereux ou violent?\n[50] Tous les groupes identifiables vis\u00e9s par les documents en l'esp\u00e8ce sont d\u00e9crits, d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre, comme \u00e9tant fonci\u00e8rement dangereux ou violents. Les Autochtones commettraient la majorit\u00e9 des crimes au Canada alors que les Noirs commettraient 50 p. 100 de l'ensemble des viols (l'autre 50 p. 100 des viols seraient commis par les Autochtones). Les Asiatiques sont d\u00e9crits comme \u00e9tant des membres de gangs meurtriers, les musulmans sont d\u00e9crits comme \u00e9tant des terroristes et les Juifs contr\u00f4leraient la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. Pour ces motifs, proud18 estime qu'il est justifi\u00e9 de prendre des mesures contre ces groupes. De m\u00eame, WhiteEuroCanadian d\u00e9crit les homosexuels comme \u00e9tant des p\u00e9dophiles et pr\u00e9tend que les autres personnes ne devraient pas \u00eatre expos\u00e9es \u00e0 des [traduction] pervertis sexuels comme les homosexuels.\nf) Les messages transmettent l'id\u00e9e que les membres des groupes identifiables n'ont aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te leurs d\u00e9fauts et qu'ils sont fonci\u00e8rement mauvais. [51] Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 34, dans l'un des messages en litige, on d\u00e9crivait les Juifs sionistes comme n'ayant aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te leurs d\u00e9fauts et on les d\u00e9crivait comme suit : des escrocs, des criminels, des bellicistes, des p\u00e9dophiles, des gens qui sont contre la vie et pleins de haine [...] Voil\u00e0 leur vraie nature. Ils ne peuvent changer et ne changeront pas. Le Tribunal a conclu que, lorsqu'on les lisait dans leur contexte, les messages indiquaient au lecteur que les Juifs sont fonci\u00e8rement retors et perfides et qu'ils ont un instinct meurtrier. Non seulement veulent-ils enlever, corrompre et tuer des enfants de race blanche, mais leur but ultime est de conqu\u00e9rir le monde (Warman c. Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 48). Le Tribunal a conclu que de tels messages ne peuvent que contribuer \u00e0 fomenter la haine contre le peuple juif.\nLes documents en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent-ils le th\u00e8me de aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te les d\u00e9fauts?\n[52] Tous les messages en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent le th\u00e8me susmentionn\u00e9 parce qu'ils d\u00e9crivent les groupes identifiables en termes tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gatifs et donnent \u00e0 penser que leurs membres ne poss\u00e8dent aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te leurs d\u00e9fauts.\n[53] Les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 \u00e0 propos des Canadiens d'origine autochtone sont particuli\u00e8rement durs \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Dans un message affich\u00e9 le 18 novembre 2003 dans un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Les Autochtones nous arnaquent, proud18 d\u00e9clare ce qui suit : [traduction] T\u00f4t ou tard, ces Indiens enfreignent tous la loi, c'est dans leurs g\u00eanes de mal se conduire. Dans un autre message, proud18 demande pour la forme \u00e0 [traduction] ceux qui aiment ces Sauvages de donner [traduction] UN seul exemple, le plus petit soit-il, d'avantage qu'ils procurent \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Proud18 r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la question de la mani\u00e8re suivante : [traduction] Juste un seul exemple qu'un Sauvage est bon, [...] je suis capable d'entendre une \u00e9pinglette tomber dans la for\u00eat avec ce silence pesant.\n[54] Dans un autre message affich\u00e9 le 11 octobre 2003 dans un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Si vous aimez les Sauvages, alors ne lisez pas ceci. Proud18 a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nAlors, vous qui aimez les Sauvages, ne lisez pas ce fil de discussion parce que vous verrez que vos soi-disant fiers Autochtones ne sont rien d'autre qu'une perte de temps et un fardeau pour le reste de la population. Merde, donnez leur une province toute enti\u00e8re et ces fain\u00e9ants cr\u00e8veront en moins de deux g\u00e9n\u00e9rations si nous ne les aidons pas financi\u00e8rement.\n[55] Les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 \u00e0 propos des Roms mentionnent que les Roms sont [traduction] un sale groupe d'Hindous. Selon proud18, ce sont [traduction] des voleurs, des meurtriers, des prox\u00e9n\u00e8tes et des agresseurs qui sont partis de la R\u00e9publique tch\u00e8que et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s au Canada sur la promesse qu'ils jouiraient d'un syst\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 et d'un syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9ducation gratuits.\n[56] Les messages en l'esp\u00e8ce renforcent l'id\u00e9e que les membres des groupes identifiables sont \u00e0 ce point d\u00e9nu\u00e9s de qualit\u00e9s qui rach\u00e8tent leurs d\u00e9fauts qu'il est justifi\u00e9 de les ha\u00efr et de les m\u00e9priser intens\u00e9ment. De plus, ils v\u00e9hiculent l'id\u00e9e qu'il est inutile de s'attendre \u00e0 ce que les groupes identifiables se conduisent de fa\u00e7on civilis\u00e9e, qu'ils respectent les lois ou qu'ils soient productifs et ils tournent en d\u00e9rision les lecteurs qui pourraient faire preuve d'une certaine ouverture d'esprit envers les membres de ces groupes.\ng) Les messages v\u00e9hiculent l'id\u00e9e que seuls le bannissement, la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation ou l'\u00e9radication du groupe de personnes en question \u00e9pargneront aux autres les pr\u00e9judices caus\u00e9s par ce groupe [57] Dans Nealy c. Johnston, (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, on pr\u00e9tendait dans les messages en litige que les immigrants de couleur constituaient une sous-humanit\u00e9 et qu'ils \u00e9taient entr\u00e9s au Canada gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la conspiration juive afin de commettre le g\u00e9nocide racial l\u00e9galis\u00e9 contre la race blanche. On affirmait dans ces messages que la seule solution \u00e9tait que l'on expulse les immigrants de couleur par la force ou que, \u00e0 tout le moins, on les s\u00e9pare de la population blanche. Le Tribunal a conclu que ces messages pr\u00f4naient le recours \u00e0 la violence comme moyen proactif de d\u00e9fense contre quiconque est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un ennemi de la puret\u00e9 raciale (Nealy c. Johnston, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 45668).\nLes documents en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent-ils le th\u00e8me du bannissement, de la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation ou de l'\u00e9radication du groupe identifiable?\n[58] Dans un message affich\u00e9 sur stormfront.org le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2004, proud18 propose que l'on donne aux Canadiens d'origine autochtone un aller simple pour l'Asie [traduction] ainsi qu'une caisse de Lysol ou de colle et ils ne sauront m\u00eame pas o\u00f9 ils s'en vont. Proud18 conclut comme suit : [traduction] Alors on pourrait retrouver la place qui nous revient en tant que premier peuple europ\u00e9en \u00e0 \u00eatre arriv\u00e9 sur ce continent.\n[59] Dans un autre message, proud18 affirme que les Autochtones [traduction] ne devraient pas \u00eatre cantonn\u00e9s dans des r\u00e9serves mais devraient plut\u00f4t \u00eatre incarc\u00e9r\u00e9s dans des ZOOS. Dans un autre message, proud18 affirme ce qui suit : [traduction] [c]es Sauvages ne savent rien sauf qu'ils sont des b\u00eates sauvages qui ne devraient pas vivre parmi la civilisation.\n[60] De m\u00eame, dans le message qu'il a affich\u00e9 \u00e0 propos des Noirs, proud18 affirme que [traduction] [les Noirs] devraient vivre dans la jungle et non pas parmi la civilisation.\n[61] Ces messages v\u00e9hiculent l'id\u00e9e que les Noirs et les Autochtones sont tellement r\u00e9pugnants que les Canadiens de race blanche ne devraient pas les fr\u00e9quenter. Ces messages cr\u00e9ent un climat propice \u00e0 la prolif\u00e9ration de la haine et du m\u00e9pris.\nh) On d\u00e9shumanise le groupe identifiable en comparant ses membres \u00e0 des animaux, \u00e0 de la vermine, \u00e0 des excr\u00e9ments et \u00e0 d'autres substances nocives. [62] Dans Warman c.Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, les Noirs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crits comme \u00e9tant des \u00eatres dot\u00e9s de quotients intellectuels inf\u00e9rieurs. Ils y sont \u00e9galement trait\u00e9s de coquerelles et de cons de n\u00e8gres - singes. Le Tribunal a conclu que des descriptions de ce genre sont d\u00e9shumanisantes, d\u00e9gradantes et tr\u00e8s susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris les Noirs ainsi que les autres personnes qui n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 la race blanche (Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 80).\n[63] De m\u00eame, dans Warman c. Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 49, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'utilisation de termes tels que sous-hommes et vermines pour d\u00e9crire les juifs risque tr\u00e8s certainement d'amener certains lecteurs \u00e0 percevoir les Juifs comme \u00e9tant des \u00eatres inf\u00e9rieurs et \u00e0 les m\u00e9priser en tant que peuple.\nLes documents en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent-ils le th\u00e8me du sous-homme?\n[64] Dans ses messages \u00e0 propos des Canadiens d'origine autochtone, proud18 d\u00e9crit ceux-ci comme \u00e9tant des [traduction] Sauvages primitifs, des [traduction] sous-hommes [traduction] qui n'ont m\u00eame pas, collectivement, un quotient intellectuel de un et qui ont plus de valeur comme [traduction] engrais que comme \u00eatres humains vivants. Il d\u00e9crit les immigrants de couleur comme \u00e9tant des [traduction] d\u00e9chets de couleur qui se faufilent jusqu'ici \u00e0 partir de pays infest\u00e9s de d\u00e9chets et il d\u00e9crit d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale les personnes de couleur comme \u00e9tant des d\u00e9chets. Il traite les Juifs de [traduction] Juifs puants et les Roms de [traduction] sale groupe d'Hindous appel\u00e9s gitans qui ont souill\u00e9 les rues de l'Europe et qui font maintenant la m\u00eame chose au Canada.\n[65] WhiteEuroCanadian d\u00e9clare que les homosexuels [traduction] ne sont pas des \u00eatres humains, ils sont des pervers sexuels.\n[66] Ces descriptions peuvent amener les lecteurs \u00e0 associer les membres des groupes identifiables aux d\u00e9chets, \u00e0 la sous-humanit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la d\u00e9pravation. En niant tout caract\u00e8re humain des membres du groupe identifiable, elles cr\u00e9ent un climat propice \u00e0 la fomentation du m\u00e9pris.\ni) Un langage incendiaire et m\u00e9prisant est utilis\u00e9 dans les messages afin de cr\u00e9er un climat de haine et de m\u00e9pris extr\u00eame [67] On a estim\u00e9 que l'utilisation dans les messages d'\u00e9pith\u00e8tes comme n\u00e8gre, d\u00e9chet, sale Juif, paki etc., contribuait \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 que les groupes identifiables soient expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris (Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 80). Dans Warman c. Kulbashian, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 44 et 45, le Tribunal a conclu que l'utilisation du mot n\u00e8gre, lequel fait penser \u00e0 l'esclavage, \u00e0 la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation et au racisme, est en soi un signe de haine et de m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes de race noire.\n[68] Les messages mentionn\u00e9s dans Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, \u00e9taient truff\u00e9s de jurons et \u00e9taient marqu\u00e9s par une col\u00e8re hyst\u00e9rique. Par exemple, dans l'un de ces messages, l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nLES N\u00c8GRES ET LES INDIENS [ressortissants des Indes Orientales] SONT DES MERDEUX!!!! FOUTEZ LE CAMP DE NOTRE CIVILISATION, BANDE DE D\u00c9CHETS!!!!\n[69] Le degr\u00e9 de violence et de vulgarit\u00e9 du langage utilis\u00e9 a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion du Tribunal que les messages en litige dans cette affaire \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer les membres des groupes identifiables \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\nLe langage utilis\u00e9 dans les documents en l'esp\u00e8ce cr\u00e9e-t-il un climat de haine et de m\u00e9pris extr\u00eame?\n[70] Les messages de proud18 sont truff\u00e9s d'\u00e9pith\u00e8tes comme n\u00e8gre, paki, sauvage. Dans l'un de ses messages, proud18 d\u00e9clare que, dans un restaurant, il avait appel\u00e9 des Autochtones Sauvages et que ceux-ci lui avaient dit que cela \u00e9tait insultant. Proud18 aurait r\u00e9pondu que tant qu'Ottawa donnerait de l'argent des Canadiens de race blanche aux Autochtones, il continuerait de les appeler Sauvages.\n[71] Le climat cr\u00e9\u00e9 par un tel langage et par de tels messages en est un de profond m\u00e9pris pour l'estime de soi des membres des groupes identifiables. Le mot Sauvage nous ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque coloniale de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord alors que les Autochtones \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par la majorit\u00e9 des Europ\u00e9ens comme \u00e9tant tout au plus des \u00eatres humains primitifs. L'utilisation de ce mot profond\u00e9ment insultant alors que l'on sait qu'il est insultant d\u00e9montre jusqu'\u00e0 quel point proud18 d\u00e9sire exposer les Autochtones \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\nj) Les messages banalisent ou glorifient les pers\u00e9cutions ou les trag\u00e9dies dont ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes les membres du groupe identifiable dans le pass\u00e9 [72] Dans Warman c. Kulbashian, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, les intim\u00e9s posaient des devinettes et faisaient des blagues \u00e0 propos de l'Holocauste. Le Tribunal a conclu que ces devinettes et ces blagues traitaient cruellement \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re la question du g\u00e9nocide des Juifs dans les camps de concentration nazis. Ceci avait pour effet de d\u00e9shumaniser les membres du groupe identifiable et de cr\u00e9er un climat de d\u00e9nigrement qui favorisait la fomentation de la haine et du m\u00e9pris.\nLes documents en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent-ils le th\u00e8me de la banalisation ou de la glorification des trag\u00e9dies du pass\u00e9?\n[73] Proud18 nie l'existence ou banalise la trag\u00e9die de l'Holocauste en le qualifiant de canular, de mensonge perp\u00e9tu\u00e9 par les Juifs dans le but d'extorquer de l'argent aux non-Juifs. Les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 \u00e0 propos des Asiatiques glorifient les d\u00e9c\u00e8s qui se seraient produits ainsi que les blessures graves qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 inflig\u00e9es lors d'une lutte de gangs \u00e0 laquelle auraient particip\u00e9 des Hindous. Le message dat\u00e9 du 4 janvier 2004 intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Deux morts, quatre bless\u00e9s, Youppie, d\u00e9crit les d\u00e9c\u00e8s et les blessures subis par des Hindous comme \u00e9tant un r\u00e9sultat heureux. Dans un autre message, proud18 fait des commentaires sur un article paru dans les m\u00e9dias selon lequel un Hindou aurait apparemment transmis le VIH\/sida \u00e0 trois femmes. Proud18 a r\u00e9pondu ceci \u00e0 propos de cette nouvelle : [traduction] \u00c7a leur apprendra de baiser avec un Hindou. J'esp\u00e8re qu'elles vont l'attraper et rapidement en plus.\n[74] En ce qui concerne les Canadiens d'origine autochtone, voici ce que proud18 a \u00e9crit : [traduction] Personnellement, je commence \u00e0 \u00eatre fatigu\u00e9 de lire qu'une tribu de Sauvages a battu \u00e0 mort un jeune Blanc parce qu'ils ont perdu leurs terres au profit de nos anc\u00eatres.\n[75] La banalisation et la glorification de trag\u00e9dies pass\u00e9es dans les messages de proud18 cr\u00e9ent un climat de d\u00e9rision et de m\u00e9pris qui rend les membres des groupes identifiables susceptibles d'\u00eatre expos\u00e9s \u00e0 ces sentiments.\nk) Les appels \u00e0 la violence contre le groupe identifiable [76] Dans Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 38, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que les messages comportaient des sous-entendus agressifs et qu'ils faisaient de plus en plus appel \u00e0 la violence contre les minorit\u00e9s canadiennes. Ces appels \u00e0 la violence \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur des messages ant\u00e9rieurs qui tentaient de convaincre les personnes qui les recevaient que les Canadiens de race blanche \u00e9taient menac\u00e9s par des groupes minoritaires et qu'ils devaient se d\u00e9fendre sinon ils couraient le risque d'\u00eatre victimes d'un g\u00e9nocide racial.\n[77] Dans Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 101, le Tribunal a conclu que les appels \u00e0 la violence contre les groupes identifiables mentionn\u00e9s dans cette affaire \u00e9taient non seulement susceptibles d'exposer les membres de ces groupes \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris, mais pire encore, ils cherchaient \u00e0 justifier, \u00e0 inciter et \u00e0 l\u00e9gitimer la violence contre les membres des groupes identifiables.\nLes messages en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent-ils le th\u00e8me de l'appel \u00e0 l'action que l'on retrouve souvent dans les messages haineux?\n[78] Dans les messages qu'il a diffus\u00e9s sur stormfront.org, proud18 demande aux lecteurs de relater les exp\u00e9riences n\u00e9gatives qu'ils ont eues avec les Autochtones. L'objectif consiste \u00e0 persuader les lecteurs de n'\u00e9prouver aucune [traduction] sympathie pour ces diables rouges et de passer \u00e0 l'action. Bien que proud18 ne pr\u00e9cise pas ce qu'il veut dire par passer \u00e0 l'action, le message suivant donne \u00e0 penser qu'il ne s'agit peut-\u00eatre pas d'actions de nature pacifique qu'il veut que les lecteurs accomplissent :\n[traduction]\nLes actes de violence commis par ces sales Sauvages contre des personnes innocentes de race blanche prennent des proportions alarmantes. Nous devons agir sans tarder en vue d'emp\u00eacher toute nouvelle agression contre notre race.\n[79] L'appel \u00e0 la violence r\u00e9sonne \u00e0 nouveau dans un autre message affich\u00e9 par proud18 :\n[traduction]\nLes personnes de couleur qui font des enfants dans le seul but d'obtenir des montants d'argent plus importants en prestation d'aide sociale sont celles qui devraient \u00eatre castr\u00e9es [...]\n[80] Proud18 pose les questions suivantes aux lecteurs de stormfront.org, vraisemblablement dans le but de les motiver \u00e0 agir :\n[traduction]\nCe que j'aimerais demander \u00e0 ceux qui ne sont pas encore certains de ce qu'ils veulent faire ou ce que les 14 mots d'ordre sont pour eux. Que faudrait-il pour que vous franchissiez la barri\u00e8re et deveniez un v\u00e9ritable patriote blanc?\nQu'un Noir viole votre \u00e9pouse ou votre enfant?\nQu'une tribu d'Indiens vous passe \u00e0 tabac?\nQu'est-ce que \u00e7a prendrait? Le bon sens \u00e0 lui seul ne suffit-il pas pour que vous vous rendiez compte que votre race a besoin que tout le monde se porte \u00e0 son secours?\nJ'aimerais \u00e9galement demander \u00e0 ce moment-ci \u00e0 ceux qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 constat\u00e9 cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il valait la peine de se battre pour la race blanche de nous faire partager vos exp\u00e9riences. Si le cur vous en dit.\n[81] L'appel \u00e0 l'action figure en fait dans tous les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18, notamment dans des d\u00e9clarations comme la suivante : [traduction] LEVEZ-VOUS ET FAITES QUELQUE CHOSE AFIN DE R\u00c9GLER CE PROBL\u00c8ME. J'estime que les messages en l'esp\u00e8ce, lesquels v\u00e9hiculent le th\u00e8me de l'appel \u00e0 l'action, sont tr\u00e8s incendiaires et tr\u00e8s provocateurs. Non seulement ils sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres des groupes identifiables \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 des actes de violence. M\u00eame si l'appel \u00e0 l'action qui figure dans les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 et WhiteEuroCanadian n'est pas toujours explicitement un appel \u00e0 l'action violente, il ressort clairement qu'il s'agit d'un appel \u00e0 une certaine forme de confrontation, de r\u00e9sistance ou d'opposition. Le caract\u00e8re urgent de ces messages inhibe le jugement et l'ouverture d'esprit. Il diabolise les groupes identifiables, les exposant ainsi \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n(ii) La conclusion tir\u00e9e par le Tribunal \u00e0 propos des messages en litige [82] Les th\u00e8mes v\u00e9hicul\u00e9s dans les messages haineux sont ce qui les diff\u00e9rencient de l'expression l\u00e9gitime, laquelle n'est pas sanctionn\u00e9e par l'article 13 de la Loi. Tous ces th\u00e8mes comportent une attaque contre l'estime de soi et la dignit\u00e9 intrins\u00e8ques des membres des groupes identifiables. Pour paraphraser les mots du juge Muldoon de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les documents qui v\u00e9hiculent les th\u00e8mes distinctifs figurant dans les messages haineux raillent ou ridiculisent autrui simplement parce qu'il respire, parce qu'il est en vie (Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canadian Liberty Net, [1992] 3 C.F. 155, par. 56).\n[83] Les messages en l'esp\u00e8ce v\u00e9hiculent plusieurs des th\u00e8mes distinctifs qui caract\u00e9risent les messages haineux. Ils utilisent des histoires pr\u00e9tendument vraies pour justifier la description des membres du groupe identifiable comme \u00e9tant des \u00eatres inf\u00e9rieurs dangereux et violents qui ne m\u00e9ritent rien de plus que le plus grand d\u00e9go\u00fbt et le plus grand m\u00e9pris. Ils utilisent des \u00e9pith\u00e8tes et des injures racistes dans le but de cr\u00e9er un climat de profond d\u00e9nigrement et de profond m\u00e9pris. Ils pr\u00e9conisent l'exile ou la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation des membres des groupes identifiables et exhortent les lecteurs \u00e0 passer \u00e0 l'action pour contrer la terrible menace cr\u00e9\u00e9e par ces personnes.\n[84] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que les documents tir\u00e9s des sites Web stormfront.org et WCFU qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s durant l'instruction sur la pr\u00e9sente affaire sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres des groupes identifiables \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite. Par cons\u00e9quent, les messages susmentionn\u00e9s seront ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9s les messages haineux.\nC. Question no 3 - L'intim\u00e9 Peter Kouba a-t-il diffus\u00e9 les messages haineux? [85] Le plaignant et la Commission ont affirm\u00e9 que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve non contredits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s durant l'audience ont \u00e9tabli que l'intim\u00e9 Peter Kouba a diffus\u00e9 les messages haineux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s durant la pr\u00e9sente instruction. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e du t\u00e9moignage du sergent Stephen Camp du service de police d'Edmonton, d'un formulaire de d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin rempli et sign\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 et d'un t\u00e9moignage fourni par le plaignant Richard Warman.\n(i) Le t\u00e9moignage du sergent Stephen Camp [86] Le sergent Stephen Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il faisait partie de l'unit\u00e9 des crimes haineux du service de police d'Edmonton lorsqu'il a commenc\u00e9, en 2003, \u00e0 surveiller le groupe de discussion canadien de stormfront.org, un site Web qu'il a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant l'un des principaux sites de propagande haineuse. Il a remarqu\u00e9 qu'un certain nombre de participants du groupe de discussion semblaient habiter \u00e0 Edmonton ainsi que dans d'autres parties de l'Alberta. Il a donc commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 surveiller plus attentivement les activit\u00e9s et les discussions de ces personnes. Le sergent Camp a \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement frapp\u00e9 par la fr\u00e9quence des messages affich\u00e9s par une personne qui utilisait le pseudonyme proud18 et qui pr\u00e9tendait habiter \u00e0 Edmonton. Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le caract\u00e8re extr\u00eame de la haine que cette personne \u00e9prouvait envers les minorit\u00e9s et les Autochtones d'Edmonton.\n[87] Le sergent Camp s'est aper\u00e7u que proud18 ainsi que d'autres membres du groupe de discussion canadien de stormfront.org collaboraient en ligne \u00e0 cr\u00e9er en Alberta un organisme appel\u00e9 Western Canada for Us qui structurerait \u00e0 Edmonton les actions politiques des tenants de la supr\u00e9matie blanche. Le sergent Camp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'unit\u00e9 des crimes haineux du service de police d'Edmonton a donc commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 craindre que proud18 et d'autres membres du WCFU commettent des actes de violence contre les minorit\u00e9s et les Autochtones de l'Alberta. Pour ce motif, la police d'Edmonton a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 personnes \u00e0 surveiller proud18 ainsi qu'un certain nombre d'autres personnes associ\u00e9es au WCFU. D'intenses travaux d'enqu\u00eate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s afin de d\u00e9couvrir les identit\u00e9s de ces personnes.\n[88] Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'un certain nombre de techniques d'enqu\u00eate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es afin de d\u00e9couvrir l'identit\u00e9 de proud18. Premi\u00e8rement, les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'il vivait \u00e0 Edmonton, qu'il organisait des rassemblements \u00e0 Edmonton et discutait de la cr\u00e9ation en Alberta d'une collectivit\u00e9 pour Blancs qui s'appellerait Whiteville. On a surveill\u00e9 les rassemblements et les r\u00e9unions \u00e0 l'organisation desquels proud18 avait particip\u00e9. Un de ces rassemblements a eu lieu, en f\u00e9vrier 2004, \u00e0 l'auberge Sandman d'Edmonton. \u00c0 cet endroit, une personne portant le nom de Peter Kouba a parl\u00e9 de Whiteville et de la strat\u00e9gie qui serait utilis\u00e9e afin de commencer \u00e0 cr\u00e9er Whiteville. Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les d\u00e9clarations faites par Peter Kouba lors du rassemblement concordaient avec les d\u00e9clarations que proud18 avait faites dans le groupe de discussion de stormfront.org.\n[89] Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la police a effectu\u00e9 des v\u00e9rifications informatis\u00e9es dans le registre des v\u00e9hicules automobiles et a utilis\u00e9 d'autres sources de renseignements comme le syst\u00e8me de donn\u00e9es du CIPC (Centre d'information de la police canadienne) afin de d\u00e9couvrir l'identit\u00e9 de proud18. Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que gr\u00e2ce au registre des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, la Police a pu trouver une photo qui correspondait au nom de Peter Kouba. Elle a \u00e9galement pu confirmer que Peter Kouba \u00e9tait l'une des personnes pr\u00e9sentes lors des rassemblements et des r\u00e9unions des tenants de la supr\u00e9matie blanche organis\u00e9s par proud18 et d'autres participants au groupe de discussion canadien de stormfront.org.\n[90] Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 surveiller \u00e0 tous les jours le site Web stormfront.org afin de savoir si proud18 \u00e9tait en fait Peter Kouba. Le sergent Camp a de plus affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que pendant qu'il surveillait ce qui se passait dans Internet, il a appris que proud18 ainsi qu'une autre personne utilisant le pseudonyme SS-88 collaboraient \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'un site Web pour WCFU. Les enqu\u00eates polici\u00e8res ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que SS-88 avait assum\u00e9 la direction de WCFU ainsi que la direction de l'\u00e9laboration principale du site Web. L'enqu\u00eate a \u00e9galement amen\u00e9 la police d'Edmonton \u00e0 soup\u00e7onner fortement que SS-88 \u00e9tait une personne du nom de Glenn Bahr.\n[91] Au d\u00e9but de mars 2004, le sergent Camp a examin\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois le site Web de WCFU sur Internet. L'un des mod\u00e9rateurs du groupe de discussion de WCFU \u00e9tait une personne utilisant le pseudonyme WhiteEuroCanadian.\n[92] Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que deux semaines apr\u00e8s avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 surveiller les messages affich\u00e9s dans les sites Web stormfront.org et WCFU, il lui est apparu \u00e9vident qu'un d\u00e9saccord \u00e9tait apparu entre proud18 et les autres membres de WCFU \u00e0 propos de l'image projet\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du public par le site Web de WCFU. Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait lu des messages affich\u00e9s dans stormfront.org dans lesquels il y avait manifestement d\u00e9saccord entre proud18 et les autres membres du groupe de discussion \u00e0 propos de l'utilisation dans le site Web de WCFU de slogans et d'expressions tir\u00e9s du jargon n\u00e9onazi. Contrairement \u00e0 l'opinion de SS-88 et de celui des autres membres du groupe de discussion, proud18 croyait que l'adh\u00e9sion explicite affich\u00e9e dans le site Web de WCFU aux valeurs n\u00e9onazies aurait pour cons\u00e9quence de d\u00e9sint\u00e9resser le citoyen ordinaire de la cause du nationalisme blanc.\n[93] Vers la mi-mars 2004, les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que celui-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9 du site Web de WCFU parce qu'il n'adh\u00e9rait pas aux valeurs n\u00e9onazies partag\u00e9es par SS-88 et les autres membres de WCFU.\n[94] Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait par la suite lu, dans le site Web de WCFU, un message affich\u00e9 par SS-88, le chef de WCFU, qui \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9 : [traduction] En raison de d\u00e9saccords entre WCFU et WhiteEuroCanadian, celui-ci nous a quitt\u00e9s. Ne croyez pas les messages qu'il transmet. Cela a amen\u00e9 le sergent Camp \u00e0 croire que WhiteEuroCanadian et proud18 \u00e9taient la seule et m\u00eame personne et qu'il s'agissait de pseudonymes utilis\u00e9s par Peter Kouba.\n[95] Suite \u00e0 ces soup\u00e7ons, le sergent Camp a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en mars 2004, d'appeler M. Kouba au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pour lui demander de le rencontrer afin de discuter de WCFU et de Glenn Bahr. Le sergent Camp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la police d'Edmonton ne voulait plus intenter de poursuites judiciaires contre M. Kouba car elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de concentrer ses efforts sur l'obtention d'une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 contre Glenn Bahr, lequel, selon la police, \u00e9tait le cerveau de WCFU. Par cons\u00e9quent, le but vis\u00e9 par le sergent Camp en rencontrant M. Kouba \u00e9tait tout simplement d'obtenir de lui des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contre Glenn Bahr. Compte tenu du d\u00e9saccord manifeste que le sergent Camp a vu na\u00eetre entre SS-88 et proud18 dans les sites Web Stormfront et WCFU, il a estim\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait probable que Peter Kouba, lequel \u00e9tait, selon lui, proud18 et WhiteEuroCanadian, consentirait \u00e0 fournir des renseignements sur Glenn Bahr, lequel, selon lui, \u00e9tait SS-88.\n[96] Le sergent Camp a rencontr\u00e9 Peter Kouba le 29 mars 2005. Ils ont eu une conversation simple, de port\u00e9e large. Le sergent Camp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait confront\u00e9 M. Kouba avec le fait que, dans stormfront.org, en tant que proud18, il avait tenu des propos tr\u00e8s haineux et tr\u00e8s m\u00e9prisants \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des Juifs, des Autochtones et d'autres groupes minoritaires. Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Kouba avait r\u00e9pondu par l'affirmative, puis qu'il avait ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait affich\u00e9 les messages, non pas pour fomenter la haine, mais pour promouvoir le nationalisme blanc. Le sergent Camp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, au cours de la rencontre, M. Kouba avait discut\u00e9 de sa participation au groupe de discussion de stormfront.org sous le pseudonyme proud18.\n[97] Au cours de cette m\u00eame conversation du 29 mars 2005, le sergent Camp a discut\u00e9 de la participation de M. Kouba, sous le pseudonyme WhiteEuroCanadian, comme mod\u00e9rateur du groupe de discussion de WCFU. Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Kouba n'a pas ni\u00e9 qu'il avait utilis\u00e9 le pseudonyme WhiteEuroCanadian sur le site Web de WCFU. De plus, M. Kouba a donn\u00e9 des explications sur sa th\u00e9orie quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re de diriger WCFU et a expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi les nationalistes blancs ne devraient pas utiliser des slogans et de la propagande n\u00e9onazis. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que lui et M. Bahr avaient eu des d\u00e9saccords id\u00e9ologiques en rapport avec l'adh\u00e9sion de ce dernier au id\u00e9aux n\u00e9onazis et en rapport avec le fait que M. Kouba ne voulait pas que le nationalisme blanc soit associ\u00e9 par le public aux id\u00e9aux n\u00e9onazis. Il a affirm\u00e9 au sergent Camp que c'\u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle WhiteEuroCanadian avait \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9 de WCFU ainsi que de son site Web.\n[98] Lors de la r\u00e9union du 29 mars 2005, Peter Kouba a rempli et sign\u00e9 un formulaire de d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin. Cette d\u00e9claration, laquelle \u00e9tait un compte rendu du t\u00e9moignage que M. Kouba pourrait rendre dans un proc\u00e8s criminel intent\u00e9 contre Glenn Bahr, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve le premier jour de l'audience de la pr\u00e9sente instance. Dans cette d\u00e9claration, Peter Kouba a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\nJe n'entretiens aucune relation avec Glenn Bahr, ni avec WCFU. Lorsque WCFU est apparu sur Internet, G.B. m'a expuls\u00e9 et j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 banni en raison d'importants d\u00e9saccords sur le plan id\u00e9ologique. G.B. m'a \u00e9cart\u00e9 du site de WCFU. Je n'exer\u00e7ais aucune influence quant au contenu du site de WCFU. G.B. exer\u00e7ait un contr\u00f4le complet sur le site. J'ai quitt\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9 de WCFU en raison de l'id\u00e9ologie nazie de G.B. et de son intention de faire du site de WCFU un site haineux.\n[99] Lors de l'audience, l'intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 au Tribunal qu'il \u00e9tait l'auteur de cette d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin.\n(ii) Le t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le plaignant et la Commission [100] Par le biais du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant, la Commission a soumis des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve consistant en des copies de messages qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 Peter Kouba ainsi que par d'autres participants au groupe de discussion de WCFU et au groupe de discussion canadien de stormfront.org. On a fait valoir que le contenu de ces messages concordait avec les d\u00e9clarations faites par l'intim\u00e9 dans son formulaire de d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin et qu'il confirmait le t\u00e9moignage du sergent Camp que Peter Kouba, sous les pseudonymes proud18 et WhiteEuroCanadian, \u00e9tait l'auteur des messages haineux en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[101] Les messages suivants sont class\u00e9s sous les all\u00e9gations de fait qu'ils sont cens\u00e9s \u00e9tayer.\na) Proud18 vit \u00e0 Edmonton. [102] Dans un message affich\u00e9 sur stormfront.org le 19 octobre 2003, proud18 d\u00e9clare ce qui suit : [traduction] j'ai v\u00e9cu \u00e0 cowtown pendant un certain nombre d'ann\u00e9es mais je vis maintenant \u00e0 Edmonchuck.\n[103] Un message affich\u00e9 le 24 novembre 2003 dans stormfront.org indique que proud18 vit \u00e0 Edmonton.\nb) Proud18 et SS-88 ont travaill\u00e9 ensemble \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'un site Web et d'un organisme vou\u00e9s \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de Whiteville et \u00e0 l'appui du nationalisme blanc.

Merci.\n[105] Dans un autre message affich\u00e9 dans stormfront.org le 2 mars 2004, proud18, en transmettant \u00e0 SS-88 une proposition concernant la cr\u00e9ation du site Web de WCFU, d\u00e9clare ce qui suit : [traduction] SS-88, occupe-toi de cela, tu connais mieux l'informatique que moi.\n[106] Le 4 mars 2004, proud18 a affich\u00e9 le message suivant sur stormfront.org : [traduction] [...] Nous devons compl\u00e9ter la cr\u00e9ation de ce site le plus t\u00f4t possible.

[...]\n[111] Dans la marge gauche du message affich\u00e9 sur stormfront.org, sous le pseudonyme proud18, on peut lire ce qui suit : Compte ferm\u00e9.\ne) SS-88 est Glenn Bahr [112] Dans un message affich\u00e9 en mai 2004 dans le groupe de discussion canadien de stormfront.org, un membre du groupe de discussion, utilisant le pseudonyme TemplarDan, d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nVive le chef supr\u00eame!\nVIVE BAHR!\n[113] SS-88 r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ce message en d\u00e9clarant ce qui suit :\nAHAH Dan! Arr\u00eate \u00e7a! WCFU est un groupe! NOUS participons tous! J'ai tout simplement pris l'initiative de le cr\u00e9er. [...]\n[114] Le plaignant et la Commission ont affirm\u00e9 que les messages susmentionn\u00e9s confirment que Peter Kouba \u00e9tait proud18 ainsi que WhiteEuroCanadian.\n(iii) Les explications de l'intim\u00e9 [115] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et sa plaidoirie, l'intim\u00e9 a ni\u00e9 avoir diffus\u00e9 les messages haineux en litige sur stormfront.org. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que les messages qu'il a affich\u00e9s sur stormfront.org ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le plaignant a choisi parmi les messages affich\u00e9s sur les sites Web et n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que ceux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s. Le plaignant n'a pas tenu compte des nombreux messages dans lesquels l'intim\u00e9 demandait pourquoi ses messages et ses propos \u00e9taient modifi\u00e9s par les administrateurs du site Web.\n[116] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il apporterait avec lui \u00e0 l'audience des copies de ses messages comme moyen de d\u00e9fense. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas tenu parole. De plus, il n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun t\u00e9moignage, ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 l'appui de son all\u00e9gation que les messages contest\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s ou alt\u00e9r\u00e9s de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit. Comme le Tribunal l'a soulign\u00e9 dans Warman c. Kulbashian, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 115, il ne suffit pas que l'intim\u00e9, en pr\u00e9sentant une d\u00e9fense de cette nature, fasse de simples suggestions ou de simples insinuations au cours de l'audience. S'il pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pi\u00e9g\u00e9 ou qu'on a modifi\u00e9 ses messages, alors il incombe \u00e0 M. Kouba de pr\u00e9senter une preuve \u00e0 l'appui de ces all\u00e9gations.\n[117] M. Kouba a affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne disposait d'aucun moyen de prouver qu'il n'a pas diffus\u00e9 les messages parce que les messages qu'il a affich\u00e9s sur les deux sites Web ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s apr\u00e8s qu'il fut exclu de ces sites. On ne peut pas savoir si cela est vrai ou non car aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la question du retrait des messages. Toutefois, il existe d'autres moyens gr\u00e2ce auxquels M. Kouba aurait pu prouver qu'il n'a pas r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les messages. Par exemple, il aurait pu t\u00e9moigner sous serment qu'il n'a pas r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les messages ou expliquer comment il a appris que les messages avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s et expliquer ce qu'il a fait \u00e0 ce sujet. Il aurait pu \u00e9galement appeler d'autres membres du groupe de discussion canadien de stormfront.org ou de WCFU \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner qu'ils avaient remarqu\u00e9 que ses messages avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s. La pr\u00e9tention de M. Kouba selon laquelle il \u00e9tait incapable de se d\u00e9fendre contre la plainte sonne faux compte tenu des solutions de rechange qui s'offraient \u00e0 lui.\n[118] Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, au cours de la conversation qu'il a eue avec M. Kouba le 29 mars 2005, celui-ci n'a jamais mentionn\u00e9 que quelqu'un avait modifi\u00e9 ou alt\u00e9r\u00e9 l'un ou l'autre des messages qu'il avait affich\u00e9s dans le groupe de discussion de stormfront.org ou sur le site Web de WCFU. Le sergent Camp a de plus affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l'enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par la police d'Edmonton sur les membres de WCFU n'avait permis de d\u00e9couvrir aucune preuve que M. Kouba s'\u00e9tait plaint \u00e0 l'un ou l'autre des membres de WCFU que ses messages avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s.\n[119] Compte tenu du fait que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve concernant l'all\u00e9gation que les messages qu'il a affich\u00e9s sur le site Web de stormfront.org ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s et compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage fourni par le sergent Camp que l'intim\u00e9 ne s'est pas plaint plus t\u00f4t que l'on avait modifi\u00e9 ses messages, je conclus que cette all\u00e9gation n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\n[120] L'intim\u00e9 a de plus pr\u00e9tendu, dans ses observations finales, qu'il n'y avait aucune preuve directe qu'il \u00e9tait le diffuseur des messages haineux en litige. Une preuve directe comporterait le t\u00e9moignage d'un t\u00e9moin qui a vraiment vu l'intim\u00e9 diffuser les messages ou un document qui \u00e9tablit directement que l'intim\u00e9 a diffus\u00e9 les messages. En contre-interrogatoire, le plaignant a admis qu'il n'a eu aucune connaissance directe quant \u00e0 savoir si l'intim\u00e9 avait diffus\u00e9 les documents contest\u00e9s. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa conviction que c'\u00e9tait l'intim\u00e9 qui avait diffus\u00e9 les messages reposait sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstanciels qu'il a recueillis au fil du temps.\n[121] Il n'existe en droit aucune exigence que les faits en litige soient prouv\u00e9s par une preuve directe. Dans plusieurs cas, les faits ne peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis que par la preuve d'autres faits (Sopinka, Lederman et Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2e \u00e9d. (Toronto : Butterworths, 1999), p. 38). C'est ce qu'on appelle la preuve circonstancielle.\n[122] Comme il a souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, la discrimination n'est pas une pratique que l'on manifeste ouvertement (voir par exemple : Morin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) 2005 TCDP 41, par. 191). En fait, il existe tr\u00e8s peu de cas o\u00f9 l'on peut prouver directement que la discrimination est pratiqu\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal doit souvent tenir compte de l'ensemble des circonstances pour \u00e9tablir s'il y a eu discrimination. Une conclusion de discrimination peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e lorsque les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve offerts \u00e0 l'appui rendent cette conclusion plus probable que les autres conclusions ou hypoth\u00e8ses possibles.\n[123] Comme dans de nombreux cas de discrimination, il n'existe aucune preuve directe en l'esp\u00e8ce que l'intim\u00e9 a diffus\u00e9 les messages haineux. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour statuer sur l'identit\u00e9 de proud18 et de WhiteEuroCanadian, le Tribunal doit appr\u00e9cier les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstancielle qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\n[124] Durant l'audience, l'intim\u00e9 s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation d'un certain nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au motif qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas pertinents et qu'ils constituaient du ou\u00ef-dire. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu, \u00e0 la fin de l'audience, que l'ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant l'identit\u00e9 du diffuseur des messages haineux constituaient du ou\u00ef-dire et que, par cons\u00e9quent, on ne devrait leur accorder que tr\u00e8s peu d'importance. \u00c0 l'audience, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant l'identit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient pertinents et que l'alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi autorisait le Tribunal \u00e0 accepter la preuve par ou\u00ef-dire. La preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise pour ce motif.\n[125] Le Tribunal est toutefois conscient des faiblesses potentielles de la preuve par ou\u00ef-dire. L'une de ces faiblesses potentielles est que la personne qui est cens\u00e9e avoir fait les d\u00e9clarations constituant du ou\u00ef-dire ne soit pas pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'audience et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ses d\u00e9clarations ne peuvent pas \u00eatre v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es. Un autre probl\u00e8me avec la preuve par ou\u00ef-dire est qu'il se peut que sa fiabilit\u00e9 et sa v\u00e9racit\u00e9 soient douteuses. Le probl\u00e8me des faiblesses de la preuve par ou\u00ef-dire peut toutefois \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par l'importance que lui accorde le Tribunal lorsqu'il prend sa d\u00e9cision. L'importance qui est accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la preuve d\u00e9pend \u00e9galement, dans une large mesure, de sa valeur probante ou de la mesure dans laquelle elle tend \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les faits \u00e0 l'appui desquels elle est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\n[126] Une certaine partie de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission en rapport avec l'identit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas particuli\u00e8rement fiable ou probante et, par cons\u00e9quent, je lui ai accord\u00e9 tr\u00e8s peu d'importance. Par exemple, la Commission a produit des copies de messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur stormfront.org concernant la pr\u00e9tendue participation de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 une tribune radiophonique. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que, dans l'un de ces messages, l'intim\u00e9, sous le pseudonyme proud18 a r\u00e9pondu aux d\u00e9clarations faites par un autre membre du groupe de discussion de stormfront.org que proud18 \u00e9tait Peter Kuda et qu'il avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission radiophonique. Dans le message en question, proud18 a admis ne pas \u00eatre Peter Kuda et ne pas avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission radiophonique. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la valeur probante de cette preuve est faible et je lui ai accord\u00e9 peu d'importance.\n[127] Toutefois, le t\u00e9moignage du sergent Camp, le formulaire de d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin et les messages affich\u00e9s sur les sites Web stormfront.org et WCFU pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente sont tr\u00e8s probants et tr\u00e8s fiables. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour les raisons suivantes, j'ai accord\u00e9 beaucoup d'importance \u00e0 ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[128] Le sergent Camp a rendu un t\u00e9moignage cr\u00e9dible quant au fondement de sa conclusion selon laquelle proud18 et WhiteEuroCanadian \u00e9taient les pseudonymes utilis\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9. J'estime que le t\u00e9moignage du sergent Camp concernant la r\u00e9union du 29 mars 2005 est particuli\u00e8rement pertinent. Au cours de cette r\u00e9union, le sergent Camp a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 les messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 sur stormfront.org ainsi que les messages affich\u00e9s par WhiteEuroCanadian sur le site Web de WCFU. Le sergent Camp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Kouba n'a pas ni\u00e9 avoir r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ces messages et, que, en effet, il a tent\u00e9 d'en prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 en affirmant qu'il les avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9s non pas dans le but de fomenter la haine mais dans le but de faire campagne en faveur du nationalisme blanc et de la fiert\u00e9 blanche.\n[129] M. Kouba a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de contester le t\u00e9moignage du sergent Camp en contre-interrogatoire. Il ne l'a pas fait et, en fait, il n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent le jour o\u00f9 le sergent Camp a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. De plus, il a choisi de ne pas t\u00e9moigner afin de donner sa version des faits. M. Kouba peut donc difficilement affirmer, au terme de l'audience, que la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 des propos tenus par le sergent Camp quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 29 mars 2005 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e et que, par cons\u00e9quent, on devrait leur accorder peu d'importance. Je conclus donc que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, M. Kouba a fait les d\u00e9clarations relat\u00e9es par le sergent Camp dans son t\u00e9moignage.\n[130] Au cours de l'audience, l'intim\u00e9 a admis avoir rempli le formulaire de d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin. Par cons\u00e9quent, le caract\u00e8re authentique de cette d\u00e9claration est \u00e9tabli. L'intim\u00e9 a toutefois pr\u00e9tendu que le formulaire de d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin ne comprenait aucune admission de sa part qu'il \u00e9tait proud18 ou WhiteEuroCanadian. Je prends note du point soulev\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9. Toutefois, la valeur probante du formulaire de d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin repose sur le fait qu'il \u00e9tablit que Glenn Bahr a expuls\u00e9 Peter Kouba de WCFU en raison de d\u00e9saccords de nature id\u00e9ologique en rapport avec l'adh\u00e9sion de Bahr \u00e0 la philosophie n\u00e9onazie.\n[131] Lorsque la teneur du formulaire de d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin est compar\u00e9 aux messages affich\u00e9s par proud18 sur le site Web stormfront.org, aux messages affich\u00e9s par SS-88 sur le site Web WCFU, aux d\u00e9clarations faites par Peter Kouba lors de la rencontre qu'il a eue avec le sergent Camp le 27 mars 2005, il y a de fortes raisons de conclure que Peter Kouba est la personne qui utilisait les pseudonymes proud18 et WhiteEuroCanadian pour transmettre les messages haineux en litige.\n[132] Les messages indiquent que proud18 vivait \u00e0 Edmonton et que lui et SS-88 ont fond\u00e9 un groupe portant le nom de Western Canada for Us. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s que WCFU eut cr\u00e9\u00e9 son site Web dans Internet, SS-88 a expuls\u00e9 WhiteEuroCanadian de ce dernier en raison de d\u00e9saccords de nature id\u00e9ologique. Proud18 s'est plaint, dans le groupe de discussion de Stormfront, de son expulsion du site Web de WCFU. Cela concorde avec les d\u00e9clarations faites par l'intim\u00e9 Peter Kouba dans son formulaire de d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin.\n[133] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que les messages qui se rapportent \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 de proud18 et de WhiteEuroCanadian sont corrobor\u00e9s par le formulaire de d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin. Je leur ai donc accord\u00e9 beaucoup d'importance.\n[134] J'ai \u00e9galement accord\u00e9 beaucoup d'importance au t\u00e9moignage du sergent Camp. Celui-ci a rendu son t\u00e9moignage d'une fa\u00e7on claire, convaincante et directe. Le t\u00e9moignage du sergent Camp \u00e9tait coh\u00e9rent et conforme aux autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n(iv) La conclusion du Tribunal concernant l'identit\u00e9 du diffuseur des messages haineux [135] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve cr\u00e9dible qui \u00e9taye son all\u00e9gation que l'intim\u00e9, sous les pseudonymes proud18 et WhiteEuroCanadian a diffus\u00e9 les messages haineux en litige sur Internet. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 fournir une d\u00e9fense probatoire \u00e0 l'encontre de la preuve faite par la Commission. Donc, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je conclus que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce suffit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l'intim\u00e9 Peter Kouba a diffus\u00e9 les messages haineux en litige.\nV. LE REDRESSEMENT [136] Le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi mentionne que si le Tribunal conclut que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, il peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 54, rendre une ordonnance contre la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire. Le paragraphe 54(1) \u00e9num\u00e8re les ordonnances qui peuvent \u00eatre rendues en rapport avec la propagande haineuse. Il englobe, par renvoi, certaines ordonnances qui peuvent \u00eatre rendues en vertu de l'article 53 dans d'autres cas de discrimination.\n[137] La Commission et le plaignant ont demand\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nL'\u00e9mission d'une ordonnance portant que l'intim\u00e9 cesse de diffuser des messages comme ceux qui ont fait l'objet de la plainte; L'\u00e9mission d'une ordonnance portant que l'intim\u00e9 paye une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 au montant de 7 500 $.\n(1) Une ordonnance portant que l'intim\u00e9 mette fin \u00e0 la pratique discriminatoire\n[138] Le Tribunal ordonne que l'intim\u00e9, M. Peter Kouba, mette fin \u00e0 la pratique discriminatoire qui consiste \u00e0 diffuser sur Internet, des documents du type de ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s en l'instance comme violant le paragraphe 13(1) ou tout autre document essentiellement semblable qui est susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable pour un motif de distinction illicite.\n(2) La sanction\n[139] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) de la Loi permet au Tribunal d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 dans une instance relative \u00e0 une plainte tombant sous le coup de l'article 13 dans laquelle la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire d'au plus 10 000 $. La Commission a demand\u00e9 que l'on ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 7 500 $.\n[140] En d\u00e9cidant s'il y a lieu d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une sanction, le Tribunal doit tenir compte des facteurs suivants que le l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9dict\u00e9s au paragraphe 54(1.1) :\nLa nature et de la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que des circonstances l'entourant; La nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte; Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de son auteur; La capacit\u00e9 de payer de son auteur.\n[141] Je conclus que les nombreux messages haineux en litige qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s au cours d'une p\u00e9riode de pr\u00e8s de trois ans \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s m\u00e9prisants et tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9judiciables. Ils d\u00e9crivaient les membres des groupes identifiables comme \u00e9tant inf\u00e2mes et fonci\u00e8rement criminels. Ce qui est le plus inqui\u00e9tant avec les messages de l'intim\u00e9, c'est que non seulement ils \u00e9taient profond\u00e9ment fanatiques mais ils exhortaient \u00e9galement sciemment et intentionnellement les lecteurs \u00e0 partager les exp\u00e9riences n\u00e9gatives qu'ils avaient eues avec les membres des groupes identifiables avec les autres lecteurs du groupe de discussion. Ce faisant, l'intim\u00e9 encourageait les lecteurs \u00e0 participer \u00e0 une campagne visant \u00e0 convaincre le monde blanc que les membres des groupes identifiables ne m\u00e9ritaient rien de plus que la plus grande haine et le plus grand m\u00e9pris. Cette fomentation active de la haine et du m\u00e9pris envers les membres des groupes identifiables est fondamentalement incompatible avec l'objet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, lequel consiste \u00e0 favoriser l'existence d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans laquelle personne n'est victime de discrimination et dans laquelle tous jouissent d'une chance \u00e9gale, et ce, nonobstant ses caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles comme la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur et l'orientation sexuelle.\n[142] Toutefois, rien n'indiquait que l'intim\u00e9 avait commis dans le pass\u00e9 des actes discriminatoires.\n[143] N\u00e9anmoins, compte tenu de la nature, des circonstances, de la gravit\u00e9 et du caract\u00e8re intentionnel de la diffusion en l'esp\u00e8ce, la sanction envisag\u00e9e de 7 500 $ semble appropri\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9 n'a fourni aucun renseignement au Tribunal quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de payer la sanction envisag\u00e9e de 7 500 $. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas fourni ce renseignement, je conclus qu'il n'y a aucune raison de r\u00e9duire le montant de la sanction.\n[144] Compte tenu de l'ensemble de ces facteurs, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 7 500 $.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal d\u00e9livre une assignation \u00e0 produire aux termes de laquelle M. John Beck devra se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'audience de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La Commission pr\u00e9tend que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Beck est n\u00e9cessaire dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 le constituer partie qui sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au tout d\u00e9but de l'audience.\n[2] L'agent de M. Beck, M. Paul Fromm, pr\u00e9tend qu'il ne convient pas d'ordonner \u00e0 M. Beck de compara\u00eetre comme t\u00e9moin et de donner un t\u00e9moignage qui pourrait \u00e9tablir sa responsabilit\u00e9. Dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le Tribunal d\u00e9cide que M. Beck devrait \u00eatre constitu\u00e9 partie, son droit de ne pas t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience se trouverait viol\u00e9.\n[3] Le paragraphe 5(1) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada pr\u00e9voit que nul t\u00e9moin n'est exempt\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une question pour le motif que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question pourrait tendre \u00e0 l'incriminer, ou pourrait tendre \u00e0 \u00e9tablir sa responsabilit\u00e9 dans une proc\u00e9dure civile \u00e0 l'instance de la Couronne ou de qui que ce soit.. Sur le fondement de cette disposition et de dispositions comparables figurant dans les lois provinciales, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit que, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, toutes les parties \u00e0 des instances civiles sont capables de t\u00e9moigner et sont contraignables \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'instance de l'une ou l'autre des parties (Sopinka, Lederman et Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2e \u00e9d. (Toronto : Butterworths, 1999), \u00e0 la page 704; voir \u00e9galement : Ayotte c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada) [1961] S.J. no 111 (SKQB) ((Q.L.).\n[4] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que M. Beck peut \u00eatre contraint \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate sur la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[5] La Commission a demand\u00e9 que M. Beck apporte avec lui tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve jug\u00e9s pertinents se rapportant aux sites Web www.bcwhitepride.com et www.bcwhitepride.org, notamment : [traduction] (1) tous les contrats conclus avec des fournisseurs d'acc\u00e8s Internet depuis 2004 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui; (2) tous les courriels qu'il a transmis sur Internet; (3) tous les renseignements concernant les comp\u00e9titions de culturisme auxquelles il a particip\u00e9 comme en t\u00e9moignent les courriels figurant comme pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 l'appui dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate susmentionn\u00e9e visant \u00e0 constituer des parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e ce jour.\n[6] M. Fromm pr\u00e9tend que la demande de production de documents susmentionn\u00e9s est beaucoup trop large, qu'elle est faite \u00e0 l'aveuglette et qu'elle vise des documents non pertinents comme les documents concernant les comp\u00e9titions de culturisme.\n[7] Le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment est suffisamment clair et n'a pas une port\u00e9e trop large. Les documents sont pertinents \u00e0 la question de l'identit\u00e9 de la personne qui a transmis les messages en cause. Par cons\u00e9quent, si M. Beck est en possession de ces documents, il doit les apporter avec lui \u00e0 l'audience.\n[8] Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment semble viser l'ensemble de la correspondance \u00e9lectronique que M. Beck a entretenue avec qui que ce soit. Il s'agit d'une demande beaucoup trop large. Toutefois, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans son contexte, il semble que cette demande vise tout simplement l'ensemble de la correspondance \u00e9lectronique associ\u00e9e aux sites Web susmentionn\u00e9s. Ces documents sont pertinents. M. Beck doit les apporter avec lui \u00e0 l'audience s'il les a en sa possession.\n[9] Le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment a cens\u00e9ment trait \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 de la personne qui a transmis les messages en cause et \u00e0 celle des personnes qui exploitent le site Web de l'intim\u00e9. Dans son affidavit, souscrit le 11 mai 2006, M. Shane Martinez a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Beck s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 lui comme \u00e9tant le cofondateur de BC White Pride et comme \u00e9tant l'auteur des documents figurant dans le site Web de l'intim\u00e9. M. Martinez a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M Beck s'est \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un culturiste professionnel.\n[10] La Commission a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle demanderait \u00e0 M. Martinez de t\u00e9moigner en rapport avec la question de l'identit\u00e9 de la personne qui a transmis les messages et en rapport avec la question de savoir si M. Beck devrait \u00eatre constitu\u00e9 intim\u00e9 dans la plainte. Il s'agit de questions importantes dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Je conclus que les documents qui ont trait \u00e0 la participation de M. Beck aux comp\u00e9titions de culturisme mentionn\u00e9es dans les courriels annex\u00e9s \u00e0 l'affidavit de M. Martinez sont pertinents \u00e0 ces questions et que, par cons\u00e9quent, M. Beck devrait apporter ces documents avec lui \u00e0 l'audience.\n[11] Il sera d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une assignation \u00e0 produire aux termes de laquelle M. Beck devra se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'audience de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nKaren A.

Hadjis\n2006 TCDP 53 2006\/11\/29 [TRADUCTION]\n[1] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate qui comprend essentiellement deux demandes suppl\u00e9mentaires de divulgation de documents qui seraient en la possession de M. Lemire.\nLa premi\u00e8re demande [2] La premi\u00e8re demande de divulgation est ainsi libell\u00e9e :\n[traduction]\nTous les renseignements en la possession de Marc Lemire, dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, qui figuraient sur son site Web, lequel est administr\u00e9 par lui, ainsi que toutes les publications (livres) mentionn\u00e9es sur ce site Web, le site Web au complet y compris tous les ajouts (comme les renseignements concernant l'expert annonc\u00e9 de la Commission) qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s, dans la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 24 septembre 1999 et la date de l'audience.\n[3] Le paragraphe susmentionn\u00e9 peut \u00eatre divis\u00e9 en deux parties :\n(i) Tous les renseignements [...] dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, qui figuraient sur son site Web, [le site de M. Lemire], lequel est administr\u00e9 par lui [...] dans la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 24 septembre 1999 et la date de l'audience.\n[4] Selon la plainte de M. Warman, les documents qui sont cens\u00e9s violer l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) figurent sur le site Web appel\u00e9 freedomsite.org dans lequel se trouve le babillard \u00e9lectronique chat.freedomsite.org. Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte que M. Lemire est le propri\u00e9taire inscrit de ce site Web. Le contenu de ce site Web est donc manifestement pertinent \u00e0 un fait ou \u00e0 une question en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, les documents qui font partie de ce contenu et qui sont en la possession de M. Lemire peuvent faire l'objet d'une divulgation en vertu de la disposition susmentionn\u00e9e. J'interpr\u00e8te le mot documents comme comprenant tout texte ou tout autre renseignement emmagasin\u00e9 ou enregistr\u00e9 sous forme \u00e9lectronique.\n[5] Il est \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte que la p\u00e9riode durant laquelle ont eu lieu les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es pratiques discriminatoires se situe entre le 24 septembre 1999 et la date de l'audience. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont trait \u00e0 la nature continue de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es violations de la Loi et qui sont apparus apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte peuvent \u00eatre pris en compte par un Tribunal qui enqu\u00eate sur une plainte (Warman c. Kouba, 2006 TCDP 50, par. 17 \u00e0 19).\n[6] Il est donc ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Lemire de divulguer \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 M. Warman, au plus tard le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2006, les documents, en sa possession, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur le site Web susmentionn\u00e9 entre le 24 septembre 1999 et la date de l'audience.\n[7] La Commission a mentionn\u00e9 dans ses observations qu'elle accepte de recevoir l'ensemble des documents sous forme \u00e9lectronique, sous forme de CD-ROM, \u00e9pargnant ainsi \u00e0 M. Lemire la t\u00e2che de faire des copies papier des documents. M. Lemire peut donc divulguer les documents de la mani\u00e8re susmentionn\u00e9e s'il le d\u00e9sire.\n[8] Dans ses observations, M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend que la Commission a d\u00e9j\u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9, en janvier 2004, un certain nombre des documents figurant sur le site Web et que la Commission ne lui a pas divulgu\u00e9 quels \u00e9taient ces documents qu'elle avait t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9s. Il demande qu'une copie sur CD-ROM des documents t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9s soit produite. Selon moi, ces documents sont pertinents aux questions et aux faits de l'esp\u00e8ce et s'ils existent et sont encore en la possession de la Commission, ils doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Lemire au plus tard le 7 d\u00e9cembre 2006. Par la suite, M. Lemire ne sera tenu que de divulguer les documents figurant sur le site Web qui ne se trouvent pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur ce CD-ROM.\n(ii) [...] toutes les publications (livres) mentionn\u00e9es sur ce site Web [...].\n[9] En ce qui concerne cette derni\u00e8re demande, la Commission demande la divulgation [traduction] des publications offertes en vente sur [le] site Web. La Commission pr\u00e9tend que les renvois, sur des sites Web, \u00e0 des publications externes peuvent indirectement exposer des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi. Cet argument ne me semble pas invraisemblable. Tout d\u00e9pendra, il semble, des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l'esp\u00e8ce. Ces documents sont donc pertinents \u00e0 une question en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce et peuvent par cons\u00e9quent faire l'objet d'une divulgation\n[10] Cela dit, rien dans l'annexe jointe aux observations de la Commission n'indique que des publications externes \u00e9taient offertes en vente sur le site Web. Il semble qu'il s'agissait d'une liste de titres d'articles ou de livres. Tous les titres sont soulign\u00e9s, ce qui signifie souvent dans un site Web que si l'on clique sur un mot ou sur un bout de phrase on est redirig\u00e9 vers une autre page Web. Il se peut donc qu'un certain nombre ou que l'ensemble des publications soient accessibles gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces liens figurant sur le site Web. En vertu de l'ordonnance de divulgation rendue ant\u00e9rieurement dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, ces documents seront divulgu\u00e9s.\n[11] Si, toutefois, un certain nombre de ces publications ne sont pas accessibles sur le site Web lui-m\u00eame et que M. Lemire est en possession de celles-ci, il doit les divulguer \u00e0 la Commission et au plaignant. Dans ses observations, la Commission reconna\u00eet que faire des copies de ces documents pourrait se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler une t\u00e2che tr\u00e8s fastidieuse et tr\u00e8s on\u00e9reuse pour M. Lemire. La Commission propose donc que l'on demande tout simplement \u00e0 M. Lemire de permettre que ces documents puissent \u00eatre consult\u00e9s. Il s'agit d'une solution de rechange raisonnable. M. Lemire est donc tenu de remettre les documents \u00e0 son avocate, Mme Kulaska, laquelle donnera \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 M. Warman la possibilit\u00e9 de les consulter. On s'attend \u00e0 ce que les parties coop\u00e8rent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard afin que la divulgation soit termin\u00e9e au plus tard le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2006.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me demande [12] La deuxi\u00e8me demande de divulgation est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9e :\n[traduction]\nL'ensemble des documents, des transcriptions, des d\u00e9clarations, des discours tir\u00e9s d'autres audiences ou d'autres sources que l'intim\u00e9 a en sa possession.\n[13] Cette demande de divulgation n'est pas accueillie. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de la divulgation dans une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure (Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 32, par. 40 \u00e0 42), de telles demandes de divulgation qui sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9es et qui ne sont pas pr\u00e9cises doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es.\n[14] Il ressort des observations de la Commission que, par la pr\u00e9sente demande, celle-ci voulait s'assurer que M. Lemire divulguent tous les renseignements et tous les documents pertinents aux questions et aux faits de l'esp\u00e8ce. Toutefois, l'article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal exige d\u00e9j\u00e0 ce degr\u00e9 de divulgation de la part de toutes les parties. Il est donc inutile de rendre, contre l'une des parties, une ordonnance qui ne fait que r\u00e9it\u00e9rer cette exigence.\nAthanasios D.

La position des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes [6] Dans sa demande de divulgation, l'intim\u00e9e requiert que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la plaignante de divulguer des informations relatives \u00e0 sa condition m\u00e9dicale qui ne lui avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 l'appui de la demande d'enr\u00f4lement de la plaignante du 13 juillet 1999 puis non divulgu\u00e9es \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, aux Forces canadiennes et au Tribunal dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, soit l'expertise m\u00e9dicale du docteur Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, psychiatre, dat\u00e9e du 18 mars 1998 et le rapport d'invalidit\u00e9 du docteur Jean Rodrigue, dat\u00e9 du 5 janvier 1998.\n[7] Soit dit en passant, nulle obligation n'est faite en vertu des r\u00e8gles de divulgation de transmettre au Tribunal quelque document que ce soit. Une divulgation a lieu entre les parties \u00e0 une plainte sans que le Tribunal n'y soit partie.\n[8] Dans le cadre de sa demande, l'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que la plaignante a, \u00e0 tort, omis de divulguer ces deux rapports qui, avance-t-elle, ont trait \u00e0 la condition m\u00e9dicale de la plaignante. Elle soutient que la plaignante n'a pas respect\u00e9 le sens et la port\u00e9e de l'ordonnance du Tribunal rendue le 28 novembre 2005. Nous y reviendrons.\n[9] L'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que les informations m\u00e9dicales contenues aux deux documents d\u00e9crits ci-dessus se rapportent au processus de changement de sexe de la plaignante et permettent d'\u00e9valuer l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de celle-ci.\n[10] Dans son argumentation \u00e9crite, l'intim\u00e9e soutient que les documents m\u00e9dicaux en litige sont essentiels \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension de l'historique m\u00e9dical complet de la plaignante.\nB. La position de la plaignante [11] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e, la plaignante fait notamment valoir que les documents dont l'intim\u00e9e recherche la divulgation ne sont pas pertinents au litige, qu'ils font partie d'un dossier de relations de travail, et qu'ils sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le secret professionnel.\n[12] En outre, la plaignante soutient que l'expertise m\u00e9dicale du docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 n'entre pas dans la cat\u00e9gorie des documents mentionn\u00e9s par ma coll\u00e8gue Karen Jensen dans sa d\u00e9cision du 28 novembre 2005.\nC. La position de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne [13] La position de la Commission se trouve expos\u00e9e dans une lettre adress\u00e9e au Tribunal le 12 octobre 2006.\n[14] La Commission soutient la position prise par la plaignante en ce qui concerne son refus de divulguer les deux documents d\u00e9crits ci-dessus parce que non pertinents aux questions en litige en rapport avec la pr\u00e9sente plainte. La Commission fait valoir que les rapports m\u00e9dicaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s strictement dans le cadre d'un grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par la plaignante contre son ancien employeur et touchent uniquement \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 du consentement donn\u00e9 par la plaignante en lien avec sa d\u00e9mission du Coll\u00e8ge Garneau survenue le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Pour la Commission, la recherche de divulgation de ces documents est une exp\u00e9dition de p\u00eache.\n[15] Par ailleurs, la Commission souligne que les documents recherch\u00e9s ne peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s au soutien de la d\u00e9cision des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes de rejeter la demande d'enr\u00f4lement de la plaignante.\nII. ANALYSE [16] D'entr\u00e9e de jeu, il importe de pr\u00e9ciser que ce n'est pas la condition m\u00e9dicale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la plaignante qui est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment en litige, mais sa condition m\u00e9dicale reli\u00e9e \u00e0 sa condition de personne transgenre ou transsexuelle. Ceci fut clairement \u00e9tabli dans la d\u00e9cision rendue par ma coll\u00e8gue Jensen le 28 novembre 2005, d\u00e9cision qui, faut-il le rappeler, portait notamment sur les informations m\u00e9dicales relatives \u00e0 la plaignante d\u00e9tenues par le docteur Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9.\n[17] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, ma coll\u00e8gue Jensen d\u00e9finit les param\u00e8tres de la divulgation de documents de nature m\u00e9dicale reli\u00e9s au pr\u00e9sent dossier. Selon elle, et je cite: ... seuls les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux qui ont trait au processus de changement de sexe et \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle de madame Montreuil doivent \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s. Ce ne sont donc pas les documents de nature m\u00e9dicale reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la condition m\u00e9dicale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la plaignante qui sont pertinents en l'esp\u00e8ce, mais ceux qui ont trait au processus de changement de sexe et \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle de la plaignante.\n[18] Regardons maintenant ce qu'il en est des deux documents dont l'intim\u00e9e demande la divulgation.\n(i) Le rapport d'expertise du Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 [19] Il importe de rappeler ici que le rapport d'expertise du docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l'objet d'une requ\u00eate en divulgation dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier. En effet, le dossier et la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8lent qu'en septembre 2005, l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9sentait une requ\u00eate en divulgation portant sur trois documents, soit les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux du docteur Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, du docteur Roland Tremblay et du docteur Martine Lehoux. La plaignante s'\u00e9tait alors object\u00e9e \u00e0 la divulgation de ces dossiers au motif qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas pertinents eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination formul\u00e9e par la plaignante \u00e0 l'endroit des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes.\n[20] Dans sa d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 28 novembre 2005, ma coll\u00e8gue Jensen concluait, comme nous l'avons pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment soulign\u00e9, que seuls les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux qui ont trait au processus de changement de sexe et \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle de madame Montreuil devraient \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s. Elle ordonnait alors ... que les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux se rapportant \u00e0 Micheline Montreuil (ou Pierre Montreuil, comme elle s'appelait autrefois), dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, [...] soient communiqu\u00e9s par les m\u00e9decins suivants: le docteur Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, le docteur Roland Tremblay et le docteur Martine Lehoux. La d\u00e9cision de ma coll\u00e8gue Jensen fut prise sans que celle-ci ne consulte personnellement les documents en litige.\n[21] Par ailleurs, ma\u00eetre Jensen indiquait dans sa d\u00e9cision qu'afin de prot\u00e9ger le droit de madame Montreuil \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9, les documents devraient \u00eatre transmis au procureur des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes et ne devraient \u00eatre transmis \u00e0 aucune autre personne sans que le Tribunal n'y ait d'abord consenti et sans que madame Montreuil n'en soit avis\u00e9e. Elle indiquait \u00e9galement que les documents pouvaient \u00eatre consult\u00e9s par des experts m\u00e9dicaux dont les services sont retenus par les Forces canadiennes et ce, uniquement aux fins du pr\u00e9sent litige et ne devaient pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 des fins qui ne concernent pas le pr\u00e9sent litige.\n[22] Lors de l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, les parties ont rappel\u00e9 au Tribunal qu'il ne devait pas s'\u00e9carter de la d\u00e9cision de ma\u00eetre Jensen qui avait balis\u00e9 le d\u00e9bat quant aux documents de nature m\u00e9dicale qui devaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s par la plaignante.\n[23] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le aujourd'hui que madame Montreuil n'a pas consult\u00e9 le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 dans le cadre d'un processus de changement de sexe, mais comme expert pour \u00e9valuer, dans le cadre d'un grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par madame Montreuil \u00e0 la suite de sa d\u00e9mission le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1997 du Coll\u00e8ge Garneau, si sa d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9missionner \u00e9tait un choix libre et \u00e9clair\u00e9.\n[24] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le ainsi que la plaignante n'a pas consult\u00e9 le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 comme m\u00e9decin traitant, mais comme expert. Cela dit, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'ordonnance qui lui \u00e9tait adress\u00e9e de communiquer au procureur des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du dossier m\u00e9dical qu'il avait concernant la plaignante, le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 fit part au procureur des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes du temps, ma\u00eetre Claude Morissette, et ce, en deux occasions, qu'il n'avait plus en sa possession le rapport d'expertise fait en rapport avec le grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en 1998 par la plaignante, celui-ci ne conservant ses dossiers pas plus de cinq ans. Or, il appert de la preuve que le rapport d'expertise, bien qu'il ne soit plus en la possession du docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9, est en la possession de la plaignante et de tiers identifi\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience par la plaignante.\n[25] Force est de constater que n'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 la pratique du docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 de ne pas conserver ses dossiers d'expertise m\u00e9dicale plus de cinq ans, le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9, sur ordre du Tribunal, aurait communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e son rapport d'expertise de mars 1998.\n[26] Cela dit, il importe n\u00e9anmoins, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de faits nouveaux d\u00e9voil\u00e9s par la preuve, de d\u00e9terminer si ce rapport d'expertise r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 satisfait aux exigences de la vraisemblance de pertinence qui r\u00e9git la divulgation de documents dans le cadre d'une plainte en discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[27] D'entr\u00e9e de jeu, il importe de souligner qu'il n'appartient pas \u00e0 ce stade-ci des proc\u00e9dures pour le Tribunal d'\u00e9valuer la valeur probante du document eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination faite par la plaignante, mais l'apparence ou la vraisemblance de pertinence du document eu \u00e9gard aux questions en litige.\n[28] La divulgation du rapport d'expertise \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e n'emportera pas pour autant que le document sera produit. Si l'intim\u00e9e entendait mettre le document en preuve, le Tribunal aurait \u00e0 en d\u00e9terminer tant l'admissibilit\u00e9 que la valeur probante et ce, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination mise de l'avant par la plaignante.\n[29] Il ne fait pas de doute que la condition de personne transgenre ou de personne transsexuelle de la plaignante est une question en litige, en lien avec l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination de m\u00eame que la question de son identit\u00e9 sexuelle.\n[30] Dans la mesure donc o\u00f9 un document se rapporte \u00e0 ces deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments, condition de transgenre ou de transsexuelle ou identit\u00e9 sexuelle, le document acquiert une vraisemblance de pertinence.\n[31] Il importe de pr\u00e9ciser qu'une partie du contenu du rapport d'expertise du docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9, dont l'intim\u00e9e recherche la divulgation, est connue. En effet, dans l'extrait de sentence arbitrale soumis au soutien de l'affidavit du docteur Assalian, on retrouve les conclusions qui apparaissent au rapport du docteur Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9. Les conclusions font \u00e9tat du fait que, pour la premi\u00e8re fois de sa vie, la plaignante \u00e9tait confront\u00e9e \u00e0 sa double identit\u00e9.\n[32] En outre, dans la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire de la sentence arbitrale, plusieurs paragraphes portent sur le t\u00e9moignage rendu par le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 devant l'arbitre ayant rendu la sentence arbitrale.\n[33] Ainsi au paragraphe 137, le requ\u00e9rant, soit le Syndicat des professeures et professeurs du Coll\u00e8ge Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Garneau, all\u00e8gue que l'arbitre ne rapporte qu'une tr\u00e8s petite partie du t\u00e9moignage rendu par le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 auteur du rapport d'expertise. Plus particuli\u00e8rement au paragraphe 137.3, le requ\u00e9rant indique que le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que la plaignante souffrait de dualit\u00e9, d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et d'angoisse.\n[34] Au paragraphe 137.7, le requ\u00e9rant reproche \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 savoir le Coll\u00e8ge, d'avoir omis de mentionner que le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le conflit \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la personnalit\u00e9 du plaignant entre Pierre et Micheline a fait en sorte que la plaignante n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable d'analyser tous les aspects.\n[35] Il appert donc que le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 a abord\u00e9, lors de son t\u00e9moignage fait en relation avec son rapport d'expertise, la question de la dualit\u00e9 de personnalit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente chez la plaignante et celle du conflit \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la personnalit\u00e9 de celle-ci. Ce sont l\u00e0, de l'avis du Tribunal, deux autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui sont pertinents au litige qui opposent la plaignante \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\n[36] Il importe encore une fois de rappeler qu'il n'appartient pas au Tribunal, \u00e0 ce stade-ci des proc\u00e9dures, de se prononcer de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit sur le bien-fond\u00e9 des pr\u00e9tentions oppos\u00e9es des parties, sur l'admissibilit\u00e9 ou la force probante du rapport d'expertise, mais de d\u00e9terminer si le rapport d'expertise a une vraisemblance de pertinence eu \u00e9gard aux questions que le Tribunal aura \u00e0 trancher.\n[37] Le Tribunal conclut donc que le rapport d'expertise du docteur Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9 du 18 mars 1998 doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\n[38] Devant le Tribunal, la plaignante a plaid\u00e9 que le rapport \u00e9tait confidentiel parce qu'il \u00e9tait de nature m\u00e9dicale et produit en rapport avec une entente qui \u00e9tait elle-m\u00eame confidentielle.\n[39] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 du rapport, le Tribunal entend reprendre les conditions de divulgation qui apparaissent \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de ma\u00eetre Karen Jensen dans sa d\u00e9cision du 28 novembre 2005.\n[40] Il importe ici de rappeler que le contenu du rapport du docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9voil\u00e9 dans plusieurs actes de proc\u00e9dures. Les conclusions auxquelles en est arriv\u00e9 le docteur C\u00f4t\u00e9 sont m\u00eame reproduites \u00e0 la sentence arbitrale.\n[41] Cela dit, ceci ne constitue pas une raison pour ne pas assurer, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res en l'esp\u00e8ce, la protection des informations divulgu\u00e9es par rapport \u00e0 des tiers qui n'auraient aucune raison de prendre connaissance du rapport.\n(ii) Le certificat du Dr. Rodrigue [42] Maintenant, en ce qui concerne le certificat du docteur Rodrigue, en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'intim\u00e9e soutient que ce document est pertinent parce qu'il se rapporte au processus de changement de sexe de la plaignante et \u00e0 son identit\u00e9 sexuelle.\n[43] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a bien indiqu\u00e9 dans quel cadre et pour quelles raisons, des raisons li\u00e9es essentiellement \u00e0 la convention collective qui requiert qu'un tel document soit produit, le certificat d'invalidit\u00e9 du docteur Rodrigue fut r\u00e9dig\u00e9.\n[44] Dans sa sentence, l'arbitre Morin, qui a pu prendre connaissance du certificat d'invalidit\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9 par le docteur Rodrigue, d\u00e9clare qu'il ne saurait pr\u00eater foi \u00e0 ce document comme preuve d'une r\u00e9elle invalidit\u00e9. Il \u00e9met l'opinion que ce certificat, donn\u00e9 un mois apr\u00e8s les \u00e9v\u00e9nements, para\u00eet trop conforme au calendrier n\u00e9goci\u00e9 par les parties dans le cadre de l'entente intervenue entre la plaignante, son Syndicat et le Coll\u00e8ge.\n[45] Au paragraphe 6 de son affidavit, le docteur Assalian affirme avoir pris connaissance d'un extrait de la sentence arbitrale dat\u00e9e du 4 f\u00e9vrier 2000 concernant la plaignante, son Syndicat et le Coll\u00e8ge Garneau. \u00c0 l'audience, le docteur Assalian a reconnu ne pas avoir pris connaissance de la d\u00e9cision et des motifs de l'arbitre, tels qu'ils apparaissent \u00e0 l'onglet 4 de la pi\u00e8ce RP-18 aux pages 9 et suivantes.\n[46] De l'avis du Tribunal, ces pages sont importantes pour statuer sur la pertinence du certificat d'invalidit\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le docteur Rodrigue dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Il est malheureux que le docteur Assalian n'en ait pas pris connaissance.\n[47] \u00c0 l'analyse des documents soumis, le Tribunal est d'avis qu'il n'existe aucun indice que le rapport d'invalidit\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le docteur Rodrigue comporte quelque information que ce soit sur la condition de transgenre ou de transsexuelle de la plaignante, sur son processus de changement de sexe ou encore sur son identit\u00e9 sexuelle.\n[48] Il est difficile de soutenir que l'extrait de la sentence arbitrale produit au soutien de l'affidavit du docteur Assalian contient quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment se rapportant \u00e0 la condition de transgenre ou de transsexuelle de la plaignante.\n[49] Le fait que le document ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par un m\u00e9decin omnipraticien quelques mois avant le demande d'enr\u00f4lement de la plaignante dans les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes ne suffit pas pour \u00e9tablir une vraisemblance de pertinence eu \u00e9gard aux questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[50] En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal ne fait pas droit \u00e0 la demande de l'intim\u00e9e d'ordonner \u00e0 la plaignante de lui divulguer le certificat d'invalidit\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le docteur Rodrigue.\nIII. D\u00c9CISION [51] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la plaignante de divulguer s\u00e9ance tenante \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e le rapport d'expertise du docteur Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9 dat\u00e9 du 18 mars 1998.\n[52] Afin de prot\u00e9ger le droit de la plaignante \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9, le rapport d'expertise du docteur Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9 devra \u00eatre transmis au procureur de l'intim\u00e9e. Le rapport pourrait \u00eatre transmis aux experts m\u00e9dicaux dont les services ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus par l'intim\u00e9e et ce, uniquement aux fins du pr\u00e9sent litige.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps\nQU\u00c9BEC (Qu\u00e9bec) Le 30 octobre 2006\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T1047\/2805\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Micheline Montreuil c.

Aucune des d\u00e9cisions qu'elle soumet ne porte sur l'exclusion de t\u00e9moins experts.\n[4] Pour la Commission, il n'y a pas lieu de faire cette distinction, la seule distinction pertinente \u00e9tant celle entre le t\u00e9moin qui est une partie et le t\u00e9moin qui ne l'est pas.\n[5] La Commission souligne qu'un des rapports d'experts qui sera produit par l'intim\u00e9e fut cosign\u00e9 par trois des experts que l'intim\u00e9e entend faire entendre. Elle soutient que, si les experts de l'intim\u00e9e sont pr\u00e9sents lors du contre-interrogatoire de l'un d'eux, cela sera pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 son contre-interrogatoire.\n[6] La plaignante souscrit \u00e0 la position de la Commission concernant l'exclusion des t\u00e9moins experts de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[7] Pour sa part, l'intim\u00e9e s'objecte \u00e0 l'exclusion de ses t\u00e9moins experts lors de l'audience.\n[8] Parmi les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9e au soutien de sa position, se trouve la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans Montpetit c. L\u00e9ger [1999] J.Q. no 1216. Dans cette cause, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait ordonn\u00e9 l'exclusion des t\u00e9moins experts du d\u00e9fendeur lors du contre-interrogatoire de l'un d'eux par le procureur du demandeur.\n[9] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour d'appel devait op\u00e9rer une distinction tr\u00e8s nette entre les t\u00e9moins ordinaires et les t\u00e9moins experts, \u00e9mettant l'opinion que, suivant la jurisprudence, l'exclusion des t\u00e9moins ordinaires est la r\u00e8gle alors que l'exclusion m\u00eame partielle des t\u00e9moins experts est l'exception et qu'elle ne peut en droit \u00eatre l\u00e9galement justifiable que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles.\n[10] Le Tribunal est d'opinion que le fait pour les experts de l'intim\u00e9e d'avoir cosign\u00e9 un rapport conjoint ne constitue pas un cas de circonstances exceptionnelles justifiant une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de la pr\u00e9sence des t\u00e9moins experts lors d'une audience.\n[11] Comme le fait remarquer la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans Montpetit c. L\u00e9ger, il est possible que la plaignante et la Commission subissent un pr\u00e9judice du fait de la pr\u00e9sence de ces experts lors du contre-interrogatoire de l'un d'eux. Toutefois, comme le souligne encore la Cour d'appel: le juge du proc\u00e8s sera en mesure, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, de tirer toute conclusion d\u00e9favorable quant \u00e0 leur cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[12] En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate de la Commission. Les t\u00e9moins experts de l'intim\u00e9e pourront \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents tout au long du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, de l'expert de la Commission, de m\u00eame que lors du t\u00e9moignage de leurs coll\u00e8gues experts lorsque ces derniers seront appel\u00e9s comme t\u00e9moins. L'expert de la Commission pourra \u00e9galement \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent lors du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, de m\u00eame que lors du t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins experts de l'intim\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps\nQU\u00c9BEC (Qu\u00e9bec)\nLe 2 novembre 2006\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1047\/2805\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nMicheline Montreuil c.

DISPOSITIF\n[1] Le 11 octobre 2006, la Commission des droits de la personne, ci-apr\u00e8s la Commission, et la plaignante se voyaient transmettre par Les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, ci-apr\u00e8s l'intim\u00e9e, une s\u00e9rie de six volumes de documents totalisant plus de 1500 pages.\n[2] Le 13 octobre 2006, la plaignante et la Commission pr\u00e9sentaient au Tribunal une requ\u00eate en ajournement de l'audition devant d\u00e9buter le 23 octobre 2006 all\u00e9guant le caract\u00e8re tardif de la divulgation des documents d\u00e9crits ci-dessus.\n[3] Ma coll\u00e8gue, Me Karen Jensen, fut initialement saisie de la requ\u00eate. Dans une d\u00e9cision rendue le 16 octobre 2006, celle-ci r\u00e9f\u00e9ra la requ\u00eate au membre charg\u00e9 d'entendre la plainte au m\u00e9rite.\n[4] Le 23 octobre 2006, date fix\u00e9e pour le d\u00e9but de l'audition au m\u00e9rite, le Tribunal fut saisi de la requ\u00eate en ajournement, de m\u00eame que de plusieurs autres requ\u00eates et demandes de la part des parties.\n[5] Les neuf premiers jours de l'audition au m\u00e9rite furent consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 la disposition des diff\u00e9rentes requ\u00eates et demandes formul\u00e9es par les parties.\n[6] L'audition fut finalement ajourn\u00e9e le 2 novembre 2006 au 4 d\u00e9cembre 2006, date \u00e0 laquelle la plaignante doit entreprendre la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision fait \u00e9tat des motifs sur lesquels est fond\u00e9e la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal d'ajourner l'audition au 4 d\u00e9cembre 2006.\nI. LA POSITION DES PARTIES A. La plaignante [7] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que plusieurs des documents qui lui furent transmis le 11 octobre 2006 sont nouveaux en ce qu'ils n'avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance dans le cadre du processus de divulgation de la preuve.\n[8] La plaignante soutient ainsi qu'elle voit pour la premi\u00e8re fois au moins 95% du volume concernant les normes de recrutement des Forces canadiennes et du volume portant sur les normes m\u00e9dicales des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes. Il en va de m\u00eame pour la litt\u00e9rature scientifique relative au transsexualisme et \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation des tests psychom\u00e9triques MMPI-2.\n[9] La plaignante soutient qu'en lui transmettant \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci des proc\u00e9dures une volumineuse documentation qu'elle voit pour la premi\u00e8re fois, l'intim\u00e9e a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation continue de divulguer tout document pertinent aux questions en litige. Selon la plaignante, cette documentation aurait d\u00fb lui \u00eatre transmise avant le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2006. En bref, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que la divulgation de ces documents est tardive.\nB. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne [10] La Commission \u00e9pouse la position de la plaignante. Pour la Commission, il s'agit en l'esp\u00e8ce d'une divulgation massive et tr\u00e8s tardive de documents. Pour la Commission, cette divulgation massive et tr\u00e8s tardive de documents que l'intim\u00e9e entend utiliser dans le cadre de sa preuve cause un pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission qui se doivent de prendre connaissance de ces documents afin de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement pour l'audition.\n[11] La Commission soutient qu'il est faux de pr\u00e9tendre, comme le fait le procureur de l'intim\u00e9e, qu'en transmettant le 11 octobre 2006 six volumes de documentation, l'intim\u00e9e n'a fait que se conformer \u00e0 l'ordonnance du Tribunal des 18 et 22 septembre 2006, qu'une telle pr\u00e9tention va \u00e0 l'encontre du bon sens. Elle soutient que le Tribunal ne saurait avoir autoris\u00e9 la divulgation de nouveaux documents une semaine et deux jours avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience.\nC. L'intim\u00e9e [12] L'intim\u00e9e soutient pour sa part que sa divulgation respecte en tout point l'ordonnance du 7 f\u00e9vrier 2006 de Me Karen Jensen et qu'elle ne fait que se conformer \u00e0 l'ordonnance du Tribunal en date des 18 septembre et 21 septembre 2006. Elle soutient, au surplus, que sa divulgation a \u00e9t\u00e9 validement autoris\u00e9e par le Tribunal.\n[13] Pour le procureur de l'intim\u00e9e, les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s le 11 octobre 2006 ne constituent pas un d\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif et ne sauraient avoir pris la Commission et la plaignante par surprise.\n[14] En ce qui concerne les documents portant sur les normes de recrutement et les normes m\u00e9dicales des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, l'intim\u00e9e souligne que ces documents se trouvent sur son site internet. En ce qui concerne la litt\u00e9rature m\u00e9dicale, l'intim\u00e9e soutient qu'elle devrait \u00eatre connue de l'expert de la Commission.\n[15] \u00c0 l'audience, le procureur de l'intim\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 que les documents transmis \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission le 11 octobre 2006 rempla\u00e7aient les documents pr\u00e9alablement divulgu\u00e9s et constituaient, en fait, la base documentaire qui serait utilis\u00e9e au soutien de sa preuve.\nII. ANALYSE [16] Lors de l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, le Tribunal a pu prendre connaissance des documents transmis par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 la plaignante le 11 octobre 2006. La documentation, qui est r\u00e9partie en 6 cahiers boudin\u00e9s, fait effectivement plus de 1500 pages. Plusieurs des documents transmis n'avaient fait l'objet d'aucune divulgation ant\u00e9rieure.\n[17] Dans une instance donn\u00e9e, la divulgation \u00e0 la partie adverse des documents pertinents aux questions en litige qu'une partie a en sa possession et la production par une partie de la documentation qu'elle entend d\u00e9poser au soutien de sa preuve sont deux choses fort diff\u00e9rentes.\n[18] La divulgation porte sur tout document qu'une partie a en sa possession et qu'elle estime \u00eatre pertinent aux questions en litige. Les documents produits \u00e0 l'audience par une partie pour \u00e9tayer sa preuve constitueront, dans bien des cas, une s\u00e9lection de documents pertinents parmi les documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s.\n[19] En l'esp\u00e8ce, on ne saurait pr\u00e9tendre que le Tribunal a autoris\u00e9 la divulgation de documents nouveaux moins de 10 jours avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience. La lecture de la transcription des notes st\u00e9nographiques relatives aux auditions du 18 et du 21 septembre 2006 ne permet pas d'en arriver \u00e0 une telle conclusion.\n[20] Cela dit, dans le cadre d'une instance donn\u00e9e, il faut non seulement \u00e9viter qu'une partie soit prise par surprise mais \u00e9galement il faut lui permettre de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement. Cela vaut notamment pour les t\u00e9moins experts qui ont \u00e0 \u00e9clairer le Tribunal sur des aspects techniques qui sont hors de son champ de connaissance judiciaire.\n[21] La transmission \u00e0 une partie d'un volume important de documents n'ayant fait l'objet d'aucune divulgation ant\u00e9rieure quelques jours avant le d\u00e9but d'une audition est de nature \u00e0 causer pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la partie \u00e0 qui ces documents sont transmis, en ce qu'elle peut l'emp\u00eacher de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement et emp\u00eacher ses t\u00e9moins experts de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement.\n[22] Parmi les documents transmis \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission le 11 octobre 2006, deux s\u00e9ries de documents m\u00e9ritent une attention particuli\u00e8re, soit les documents se trouvant sur le site Internet de l'intim\u00e9e et la litt\u00e9rature scientifique produite.\nA. Les documents se trouvant sur un site Internet [23] Le fait que des documents soient disponibles et accessibles sur le site Internet d'une partie, en l'esp\u00e8ce l'intim\u00e9e, ne saurait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme une divulgation implicite de leur contenu \u00e0 la partie adverse.\n[24] Il incombe \u00e0 une partie qui a des documents sur son site Internet non seulement de communiquer \u00e0 la partie adverse quels documents elle consid\u00e8re pertinents aux questions en litige mais \u00e9galement d'en faire parvenir copie \u00e0 cette partie.\n[25] La somme de documents aujourd'hui disponibles sur plusieurs sites Internet est telle qu'on ne saurait astreindre une partie \u00e0 rechercher sur le site Internet d'une autre partie quels sont les documents qui s'y trouvent qui pourraient \u00eatre pertinents pour les questions en litige dans une instance qui la concerne. Cette t\u00e2che revient \u00e0 la partie qui poss\u00e8de un tel site.\nB. La litt\u00e9rature m\u00e9dicale [26] Dans une instance donn\u00e9e, il importe qu'un expert puisse prendre connaissance \u00e0 l'avance de la documentation scientifique pertinente \u00e0 laquelle une partie entend r\u00e9f\u00e9rer de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir \u00e9clairer ad\u00e9quatement le Tribunal sur des questions techniques ou scientifiques. Assumer qu'un expert devrait conna\u00eetre d'embl\u00e9e cette documentation n'appara\u00eet pas raisonnable.\n[27] Ainsi, le fait que la litt\u00e9rature m\u00e9dicale soit aujourd'hui disponible sur Internet ne dispense pas une partie qui estime que certains articles scientifiques sont pertinents aux questions en litige et entend s'en servir au soutien de sa preuve de divulguer ces articles \u00e0 la partie adverse le plus t\u00f4t possible.\n[28] En l'esp\u00e8ce, il semble y avoir eu confusion ou m\u00e9prise de la part de l'intim\u00e9e entre la divulgation de documents pertinents aux questions en litige et la production des documents qu'elle entendait mettre en preuve. Ceci ne saurait \u00eatre pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission.\n[29] Lors de l'audition de la requ\u00eate, la plaignante a maintes fois r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il lui fallait du temps pour prendre connaissance de la documentation transmise par l'intim\u00e9e le 11 octobre 2006. Le Tribunal a fix\u00e9 au 24 novembre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la r\u00e9plique de la plaignante et de la Commission \u00e0 l'expos\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[30] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que la plaignante et la Commission ont eu 6 semaines pour prendre connaissance de la documentation soumise par l'intim\u00e9e. Certes, durant cette p\u00e9riode, 9 jours ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audition de diverses requ\u00eates et demandes.\n[31] Cela dit, en date du 2 novembre 2006, la plaignante et la Commission b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient d'un peu plus de trois semaines pour prendre connaissance de la documentation soumise le 11 octobre 2006 par l'intim\u00e9e et pr\u00e9senter une r\u00e9plique, ce qui, dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, constitue un d\u00e9lai qui ne saurait constituer un d\u00e9ni de justice.\nIII. CONCLUSION [32] Le Tribunal conclut que la demande d'ajournement de la plaignante et de la Commission \u00e9tait, en l'esp\u00e8ce, pleinement justifi\u00e9e, compte tenu de la teneur et de l'importance des nouveaux documents qui leur furent transmis le 11 octobre 2006.\n[33] Avoir d\u00e9but\u00e9 l'audition de t\u00e9moins le 23 octobre 2006 aurait, dans les circonstances, caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux tant \u00e0 la plaignante qu'\u00e0 la Commission, celles-ci devant b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une p\u00e9riode de temps suffisant pour prendre connaissance des nouveaux documents qui leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis par l'intim\u00e9e le 11 octobre 2006 et se pr\u00e9parer en cons\u00e9quence.\nIV. DISPOSITIF [34] Pour les motifs \u00e9voqu\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le Tribunal accueille en partie la requ\u00eate en ajournement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante et la Commission et ordonne ce qui suit :\nL'audition des t\u00e9moins dans la pr\u00e9sente instance est report\u00e9e au 4 d\u00e9cembre 2006, date \u00e0 laquelle la plaignante d\u00e9butera sa preuve;\nL'intim\u00e9e transmettra \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission tout ajout aux rapports de ses experts le ou avant le 10 novembre 2006;\nLa Commission transmettra \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e tout ajout au rapport du Dr. Beltrami le ou avant le 21 novembre 2006, ainsi que toute documentation y aff\u00e9rente;\nLa Commission transmettra \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et \u00e0 la plaignante, le ou avant le 21 novembre 2006 le r\u00e9sultat du test MMPI-2, en possession du Dr. Beltrami, y inclus le graphique et les r\u00e9ponses aux questions;\nLa plaignante et la Commission transmettront \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e leur r\u00e9plique \u00e0 l'expos\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions de l'intim\u00e9e le ou avant le 24 novembre 2006, ainsi que toute documentation y aff\u00e9rente.\nSign\u00e9e par Pierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 1er d\u00e9cembre 2006\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1047\/2805\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nMicheline Montreuil c.

Hadjis Date : Le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2006 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2006 TCDP 58\n[1] M. Lemire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate dans laquelle il demande le rejet de la plainte. Il pr\u00e9tend que les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et de M. Warman ne mentionnent pas assez de faits essentiels pour lui permettre de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re.\n[2] Ce n\u2019est pas la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision que je rends en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce concernant les pr\u00e9cisions. Le 16 ao\u00fbt 2006, j\u2019ai rendu une d\u00e9cision ordonnant \u00e0 M. Warman et \u00e0 la Commission de relever les messages qui, selon eux, constituaient des messages haineux au sens de l\u2019article 13 de la Loi (Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 32). J\u2019ai soulign\u00e9, au paragraphe 26 de cette d\u00e9cision, que si la Commission et M. Warman pr\u00e9tendent que chacun des messages figurant sur chacune des pages du site Web freedomsite.org constitue un message haineux, alors ils devraient le mentionner explicitement.\n[3] \u00c0 la suite de cette d\u00e9cision, la Commission a envoy\u00e9, le 2 octobre 2006, au conseiller juridique de M. Lemire, une lettre dans laquelle elle exposait sa position selon laquelle [Traduction] tous les messages figurant sur le site Freedom divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 [M. Lemire] sur copie papier et sur CD\u2011ROM constituent des messages haineux au sens de l\u2019article 13 de la Loi. La Commission a ajout\u00e9 que bien qu\u2019elle ferait valoir \u00e0 l\u2019audience que certains messages figurant sur le site Web [Traduction] violent l\u2019article 13 de fa\u00e7on plus explicite, comme le site Web [Traduction] ne traite que d\u2019un seul sujet, elle demanderait au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner que le site Web soit compl\u00e8tement ferm\u00e9. La Commission a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle invoquerait la preuve constitu\u00e9e par le contenu du site Web dans son ensemble afin que le Tribunal puisse [Traduction] \u00e9valuer pleinement la nature du site Web dans son ensemble et non pas \u00e9valuer uniquement quelques uns de ses aspects.\n[4] De m\u00eame, le 2 octobre 2006, M. Warman a envoy\u00e9 une lettre dans laquelle il exposait en d\u00e9tails les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019il entendait invoquer, notamment [Traduction] l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du babillard \u00e9lectronique du site Freedomsite; tous les autres exemples mentionn\u00e9s dans sa plainte; le contenu int\u00e9gral de jrbooksonline; le message intitul\u00e9 le Po\u00e8me de l\u2019immigrant canadien affich\u00e9 par M. Lemire sur Stormfront.\n[5] M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend que les d\u00e9tails fournis dans les r\u00e9ponses de la Commission et de M. Warman sont insuffisants et ne satisfont pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendue. Selon M. Lemire, ces circonstances font qu\u2019il lui est impossible de pr\u00e9parer une d\u00e9fense car il ne sait pas quels arguments sont avanc\u00e9s contre lui.\n[6] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette opinion. La Commission et M. Warman ont maintenant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on explicite que, selon eux, le site Web freedomsite.org, dans son ensemble, viole l\u2019article 13 de la Loi. Avant cette pr\u00e9cision, la Commission et M. Warman avaient tout simplement produit, dans le cadre de leur divulgation de documents, un document de 133 pages compos\u00e9 de messages figurant sur le site Web sans mentionner lesquels parmi ces messages constituaient, selon eux, des messages haineux au sens de la Loi. La Commission et M. Warman ont maintenant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, selon eux, chacun de ces messages viole l\u2019article 13. Il ne s\u2019agit que d\u2019all\u00e9gations. Il leur incombe de prouver ces all\u00e9gations lors de l\u2019audience.\n[7] M. Lemire semble pr\u00e9tendre dans sa requ\u00eate que ce ne sont pas tous les messages qui constituent des messages haineux au sens de la Loi et que rien ne justifie que le Tribunal ordonne la fermeture du site Web. Toutefois, c\u2019est lors des observations finales qu\u2019il convient de soulever ces arguments. Ceux\u2011ci n\u2019ont aucune incidence sur la question des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[8] M. Warman renvoie dans sa lettre du 2 octobre \u00e0 jrbooksonline et \u00e0 un message que M. Lemire aurait affich\u00e9 sur un autre site Web. M. Warman souligne que ces documents ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s. M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend que, en date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa requ\u00eate, la Commission et M. Warman ne lui avaient remis aucune copie du site Web freedomsite.org dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 (notamment aucune copie du babillard \u00e9lectronique), ni aucune copie de jrbooksonline, dans le cadre de leur divulgation. M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend que, compte tenu de l\u2019intention de M. Warman et de la Commission d\u2019invoquer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve tir\u00e9s des sites Web freedomsite.org et jrbooksonline dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, l\u2019omission susmentionn\u00e9e constitue une violation de l\u2019obligation de divulgation qu\u2019ont la Commission et M. Warman. Plus important encore, cette omission emp\u00eache M. Lemire de pr\u00e9parer une d\u00e9fense contre les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre lui.\n[9] Selon l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, une partie n\u2019est tenue que de divulguer les documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement mentionn\u00e9es par l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des parties. Cette obligation de divulgation n\u2019emp\u00eache pas une partie d\u2019all\u00e9guer des faits et des questions qui sont \u00e9tay\u00e9s par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve tir\u00e9s de documents qui sont en la possession d\u2019une autre partie. En effet, il n\u2019est pas inhabituel dans les instances en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne que l\u2019existence d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire soit \u00e9tablie \u00e0 partir d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui sont en la possession de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et qui sont divulgu\u00e9s dans le cadre du processus de divulgation du Tribunal (voir p. ex., Montreuil c. Banque nationale du Canada, (2004), 48 C.H.R.R. 436 (TCDP)).\n[10] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, si l\u2019un des sites Web en question, freedomsite.org par exemple, appartient bel et bien \u00e0 M. Lemire, comme le pr\u00e9tend M. Warman, il m\u2019appara\u00eet un peu d\u00e9loyal que M Lemire pr\u00e9tende que le d\u00e9faut de la Commission de lui fournir des copies du contenu de ce site Web constitue un traitement injuste. Il me semble que M. Lemire est la personne qui sait le mieux ce que contient ce site Web.\n[11] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, l\u2019article 9 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal permet de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toute question qui peut se poser si une partie tente de d\u00e9poser en preuve un document qui n\u2019a pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9.\n[12] Enfin, je souligne que, dans ses observations, M. Lemire mentionne que les documents qui figurent dans jrbooksonline comprennent [Traduction] litt\u00e9ralement des dizaines de milliers de pages. J\u2019ai l\u2019impression que ceci est un renvoi aux \u00e9crits que j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Lemire, dans ma d\u00e9cision la plus r\u00e9cente, Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 53, de mettre \u00e0 la disposition de la Commission et de M. Warman pour que ceux\u2011ci puissent les consulter. Afin d\u2019\u00e9viter que quelqu\u2019un se fasse prendre par surprise, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 M. Warman de mentionner \u00e0 M. Lemire les \u00e9crits sur lesquels ils ont l\u2019intention d\u2019attirer l\u2019attention du Tribunal lors de l\u2019audience. Cet avis doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Lemire dans un d\u00e9lai d\u2019une semaine apr\u00e8s que les \u00e9crits auront \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 au paragraphe 11 de la d\u00e9cision susmentionn\u00e9e.\n[13] Pour tous ces motifs, la requ\u00eate en rejet pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Lemire est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthania Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2006\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1073\/5405\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Richard Warman c.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Mme Sandy Lipp (n\u00e9e Culic, ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e Mme Lipp) a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour Postes Canada en 1990 comme employ\u00e9e temporaire. En 1993, elle est devenue commis des postes \u00e0 temps partiel \u00e0 Regina (Saskatchewan). Vers 1994 ou 1995, Mme Lipp a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 qui ont n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 un am\u00e9nagement en milieu de travail.\n[2] Puis, en 2001, Mme Lipp a \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9e comme souffrant d'une d\u00e9pression importante ainsi que de troubles d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 qui, dans une certaine mesure, \u00e9taient li\u00e9s \u00e0 des conflits qu'elle avait avec son superviseur \u00e0 Postes Canada. Elle a cess\u00e9 de travailler pendant un certain nombre de mois. \u00c0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque elle est tomb\u00e9e enceinte.\n[3] \u00c0 l'automne 2001, Mme Lipp a tent\u00e9 de retourner au travail, mais Postes Canada lui a dit qu'on avait besoin de plus de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux avant qu'elle ne puisse retourner au travail. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 craignait manifestement que Mme Lipp ne soit pas assez gu\u00e9rie de sa d\u00e9pression et de ses troubles anxieux pour qu'on lui permette de retourner au travail. On a cru que Mme Lipp \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 faire fi de ses probl\u00e8mes psychologiques afin d'enregistrer le nombre d'heures de travail exig\u00e9 pour pouvoir \u00eatre admissible aux prestations d'assurance-emploi durant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\n[4] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaite des renseignements fournis par le m\u00e9decin de Mme Lipp sur la capacit\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 reprendre le travail. Par cons\u00e9quent, en novembre 2001, Postes Canada a pris des dispositions pour que Mme Lipp puisse se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant (EMI) de deux jours, lequel examen serait fait par des m\u00e9decins \u00e0 Winnipeg. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait pas se rendre \u00e0 Winnipeg pour un certain nombre de raisons, notamment parce qu'elle avait des probl\u00e8mes avec sa grossesse et parce qu'elle avait peur des voyages.\n[5] Postes Canada \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 envoyer Mme Lipp en avion \u00e0 Winnipeg, \u00e0 lui payer un voyage en autobus ou \u00e0 lui louer une voiture, \u00e0 la payer, elle et son copain, pour qu'ils puissent se rendent \u00e0 l'EMI. Toutefois, Postes Canada n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 retirer l'exigence qu'elle se soumette \u00e0 un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg et l'a pr\u00e9venue que si elle ne s'y soumettait pas, elle se verrait imposer une suspension sans solde.\n[6] Mme Lipp ne s'est pas soumise \u00e0 l'EMI les 22 et 23 novembre 2001. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle s'est vu imposer une suspension sans solde jusqu'\u00e0 ce que Postes Canada re\u00e7oive les r\u00e9sultats d'un EMI concernant sa capacit\u00e9 de retour au travail.\n[7] Par le biais de son syndicat, Mme Lipp a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, le 7 novembre et le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2001, des griefs dans lesquels elle pr\u00e9tend que Postes Canada a contrevenu \u00e0 la convention collective en accusant un retard d\u00e9raisonnable \u00e0 la r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans ses fonctions et en lui imposant une suspension sans solde.\n[8] Le 16 avril 2004, un arbitre a rejet\u00e9 les griefs de Mme Lipp. L'arbitre a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Postes Canada avait raison d'exiger que Mme Lipp se soumette \u00e0 un EMI afin de prendre une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de retour au travail. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'arbitre a rejet\u00e9 l'affirmation qu'on avait accus\u00e9 un retard d\u00e9raisonnable \u00e0 r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans ses fonctions. Quant au deuxi\u00e8me grief, l'arbitre a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, compte tenu de l'attitude cavali\u00e8re de Mme Lipp \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'EMI, l'imposition d'une suspension sans solde \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e.\n[9] Le 18 mars 2003, Mme Lipp a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne dans laquelle elle a pr\u00e9tendu avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (grossesse) et la d\u00e9ficience (blessures au cou et \u00e0 l'\u00e9paule, fibromyalgie). La pr\u00e9tendue conduite discriminatoire est compos\u00e9e des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants : le refus de Postes Canada, en octobre 2001, de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans son ancien poste, l'exigence qu'elle se soumette \u00e0 un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg, la fa\u00e7on dont la r\u00e9union avec le directeur de l'usine s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e, la mesure disciplinaire prise contre elle lorsqu'elle a refus\u00e9 de se soumettre \u00e0 un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg et d'autres aspects de la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle Postes Canada a trait\u00e9 Mme Lipp \u00e0 partir d'octobre 2001.\n[10] La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal le 28 septembre 2005. Postes Canada a ensuite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e sur le fondement du principe de la chose jug\u00e9e.\nI. LA QUESTION EN LITIGE [11] La seule question \u00e0 trancher en l'esp\u00e8ce est celle qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e ou l'abus de proc\u00e9dure s'applique \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[12] Je conclus que le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e ne s'applique pas dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Il est loin d'\u00eatre certain que les questions en litige dans la plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par l'arbitre. Pour cette raison \u00e9galement, le fait que le Tribunal entende la plainte ne constituerait pas un emploi abusif de la proc\u00e9dure. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne s'agit pas d'un cas o\u00f9 il convient de rejeter la plainte sur le fondement de l'un ou de l'autre principe.\nII. L'ANALYSE Le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e\n[13] La principe de la chose jug\u00e9e est un outil juridique utilis\u00e9 pour mettre fin irr\u00e9vocablement \u00e0 un litige. C'est une fa\u00e7on de garantir que d\u00e8s qu'une d\u00e9cision finale a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, les m\u00eames questions en litige entre les m\u00eames parties ne seront pas d\u00e9battues \u00e0 nouveau dans un autre forum (Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., [2001] 2 R.C.S. 460).\n[14] Toutefois, on doit faire preuve de prudence et de retenue dans l'application du principe de la chose jug\u00e9e au r\u00e8glement des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne car le rejet d'une plainte entra\u00eene la privation de la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre entendu (Cremasco c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes 2002\/09\/30 - D\u00e9cision no1, au paragraphe 83, confirm\u00e9e par 2004 CAF 363 et Buffet c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes) 2005 TCDP 16, au paragraphe 40). Pour ce motif, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit qu'une plainte ne devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour cause de chose jug\u00e9e que dans les cas les plus clairs (Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 106).\n[15] Le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e comporte deux volets principaux. Le premier volet est connu sous le nom de pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e. La pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'applique lorsqu'il y a des questions communes \u00e0 deux instances. Selon la nature de la question \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de laquelle la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e est soulev\u00e9e, la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e peut emp\u00eacher la remise en cause d'une question sp\u00e9cifique ou elle peut emp\u00eacher la tenue d'une deuxi\u00e8me instance dans son ensemble (Hough c. Brunswick Centres Inc., (1997) 9 C.P.C. (4th) 111 (Cour Ont. (Div. g\u00e9n.), aux paragraphes 24 et 25).\n[16] Le deuxi\u00e8me volet du principe de la chose jug\u00e9e est connu sous le nom de l'irrecevabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant de l'identit\u00e9 des causes d'action. En l'esp\u00e8ce, les parties n'ont pas pr\u00e9tendu que l'irrecevabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant de l'identit\u00e9 des causes d'action s'applique. Par cons\u00e9quent, je limiterai mon analyse \u00e0 l'application de l'irrecevabilit\u00e9 pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e.\nA. La pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e : le crit\u00e8re [17] Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 deux volets quant \u00e0 l'application du principe de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e est bien connu : (1) les crit\u00e8res de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e doivent \u00eatre satisfaits; et (2) si les crit\u00e8res sont satisfaits, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9cider, selon certains facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires, s'il est appropri\u00e9, dans les circonstances, d'appliquer le principe (Danyluk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 33).\n[18] Les crit\u00e8res \u00e0 satisfaire quant \u00e0 l'application du principe de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e sont les suivants :\nles m\u00eames questions sont en litige dans les deux instances; la d\u00e9cision judiciaire qui est cens\u00e9e cr\u00e9er la pr\u00e9clusion est finale; les parties ou leurs ayants droit sont les m\u00eames.\n(i) Les m\u00eames questions sont en litige dans les deux instances [19] Pour que cette exigence soit satisfaite, le r\u00e8glement de la question en litige dans la premi\u00e8re instance doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 essentiel au r\u00e9sultat (Minott c. O'Shanter Development Co. (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.O.), au paragraphe 23). En d'autres mots, la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e vise les questions fondamentales tranch\u00e9es dans la premi\u00e8re instance, c'est-\u00e0-dire les questions qui \u00e9taient essentielles \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision.\n[20] Selon moi, ce volet du crit\u00e8re exige une analyse attentive. Bien qu'il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire que l'arbitre emploie la m\u00eame m\u00e9thode et la m\u00eame terminologie qui serait utilis\u00e9e par le Tribunal, il doit \u00eatre clair que l'arbitre a trait\u00e9 dans l'instance des m\u00eames questions en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (Rasanen c. Rosemount Instruments Ltd. (1994), 112 D.L.R. (4th) 683, \u00e0 la page 703). Les droits de la personne sont des droits quasi-constitutionnels. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est de la plus haute importance que personne ne se voit refuser la possibilit\u00e9 de voir \u00e0 ce que ces droits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9s (Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 83 et Buffet, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 40).\n[21] Dans sa plainte, Mme Lipp pr\u00e9tend que Postes Canada a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience (blessures au cou et \u00e0 l'\u00e9paule, fibromyalgie) et de son sexe (grossesse). Mme Lipp pr\u00e9tend que la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle Postes Canada a men\u00e9 l'enqu\u00eate quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de retourner au travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoire; elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente durant le processus parce qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte et(ou) parce qu'elle souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience.\n[22] Cependant, dans les deux griefs qui ont fait l'objet des proc\u00e9dures d'arbitrage, la discrimination n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e d'une fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise. Dans ses griefs, Mme Lipp a fait valoir son droit, en vertu de la convention collective, d'\u00eatre r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans ses fonctions modifi\u00e9es d\u00e8s qu'elle aura d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle en est psychologiquement capable. Par cons\u00e9quent, la question fondamentale vis\u00e9e par la proc\u00e9dure d'arbitrage est diff\u00e9rente de celle vis\u00e9e par la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne; la capacit\u00e9 de Mme Lipp \u00e0 retourner au travail et la justification de Postes Canada \u00e0 demander une preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire quant \u00e0 cette capacit\u00e9 \u00e9taient les questions en litige dans la proc\u00e9dure d'arbitrage.\n[23] Postes Canada pr\u00e9tend que m\u00eame si l'arbitre n'a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9, en tant que telle, \u00e0 une analyse en mati\u00e8re de droit de la personne et que m\u00eame s'il n'a pas non plus mentionn\u00e9 les mots discrimination ou accommodement, ses conclusions essentielles sont n\u00e9anmoins d\u00e9terminantes quant aux questions en litige dans la plainte de Mme Lipp.\n[24] Quelles \u00e9taient les conclusions essentielles de l'arbitre? L'arbitre a conclu que la demande de Mme Lipp d'\u00eatre r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans ses anciennes fonctions \u00e9tait probablement plus motiv\u00e9e par le d\u00e9sir d'\u00eatre admissible \u00e0 l'assurance-emploi que par une v\u00e9ritable am\u00e9lioration de sa sant\u00e9 psychologique. Il a conclu que Postes Canada avait le droit de savoir si Mme Lipp \u00e9tait vraiment capable de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses anciennes fonctions. Compte tenu du manque de confiance de Postes Canada dans les rapports des m\u00e9decins de Mme Lipp, l'arbitre a conclu que la tenue d'un EMI \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e.\n[25] L'arbitre a conclu que Postes Canada \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d'exiger que Mme Lipp se soumette \u00e0 un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Il a soulign\u00e9 que le m\u00e9decin de Postes Canada estimait que ce n'\u00e9tait qu'\u00e0 Winnipeg qu'elle pouvait se soumettre \u00e0 un EMI. Il a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que Postes Canada avait offert \u00e0 Mme Lipp un certain nombre de choix quant au d\u00e9placement.\n[26] L'arbitre a implicitement conclu que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont pr\u00e9tendument fait partie du retard \u00e9taient des \u00e9tapes essentielles dans le processus d'obtention des renseignements dont Postes Canada avait besoin. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a conclu que Postes Canada n'a pas accus\u00e9 un retard indu \u00e0 r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans son ancien poste.\n[27] Quant au deuxi\u00e8me grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par Mme Lipp, l'arbitre a conclu que cette derni\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venue que si elle refusait de se soumettre \u00e0 un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg elle ferait l'objet d'une suspension sans solde. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que toute impr\u00e9cision dans la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Lipp expliquant pourquoi un EMI \u00e9tait essentiel \u00e9tait attribuable aux exigences visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e de Mme Lipp. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'arbitre a conclu que Postes Canada \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d'imposer une suspension sans solde \u00e0 Mme Lipp.\n[28] Ces conclusions sont-elles d\u00e9terminantes quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte de Mme Lipp? Dans une plainte de cette nature, le Tribunal examinera si Mme Lipp a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment des autres employ\u00e9s et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il examinera si ce traitement diff\u00e9rent \u00e9tait fond\u00e9, du moins en partie, sur le fait qu'elle souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience, qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte ou pour ces deux motifs. Pour avoir gain de cause, un plaignant n'a qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le motif all\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e9tait un facteur parmi d'autres dans la conduite de l'intim\u00e9; ce facteur n'a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre l'unique facteur ou le facteur d\u00e9terminant : Martin c. Carter Chevrolet Oldsmobile, 2001 BCHRT 37, au paragraphe 21; Cooke c. Vancouver Island Aids Society (1999), 35 C.H.R.R. D\/56, au paragraphe 52 (B.C.H.R.T.); Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au paragraphe 7 (C.A.F.).\n[29] Le Tribunal examinera ensuite si Postes Canada a fourni une explication cr\u00e9dible, non discriminatoire, quant \u00e0 sa conduite. La preuve sera examin\u00e9e dans son ensemble et non pas comme une suite d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements distincts qui n'ont aucun rapport entre eux.\n[30] Le Tribunal peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si une exigence occasionne une discrimination par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable ou discrimination indirecte. Si l'effet d'une exigence apparemment non discriminatoire consiste \u00e0 imposer un fardeau plus lourd \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 ou de priver un employ\u00e9 d'un avantage en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience et (ou) de son sexe, alors \u00e0 moins que l'exigence ne soit une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, elle sera jug\u00e9e discriminatoire. Le facteur cl\u00e9 lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9cider si une exigence est une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e est celui qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si l'employeur a r\u00e9pondu aux besoins de l'employ\u00e9 sans subir de contrainte excessive (Voir : Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3, au paragraphe 49; Gosselin c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) [2002] 4 R.C.S. 429, au paragraphe120). La participation de l'employ\u00e9 aux efforts d'accommodement est \u00e9galement un facteur dont le Tribunal tiendra compte dans son analyse.\n[31] Peut-on dire que dans sa d\u00e9cision l'arbitre a trait\u00e9 de ces questions express\u00e9ment ou implicitement? Pour les motifs suivants, la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est non.\n[32] Premi\u00e8rement, l'arbitre n'a pas examin\u00e9 si Mme Lipp a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente en raison de sa grossesse et (ou) de sa d\u00e9ficience. Bien qu'il ait conclu que Mme Lipp d\u00e9sirait probablement retourner travailler parce qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte et qu'elle avait besoin d'argent, il n'est pas all\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 analyser si ce fait, ainsi que la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Lipp, ont pu influencer la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle Postes Canada a men\u00e9 l'enqu\u00eate quant \u00e0 son retour au travail et ont pu influencer l'exigence qu'elle se soumette \u00e0 un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. L'arbitre ne s'est pas demand\u00e9, en examinant l'ensemble du processus, si Mme Lipp a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment des autres employ\u00e9s parce que, du moins en partie, elle souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience et \u00e9tait enceinte. En effet, on n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arbitre de trancher cette question et il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que celui-ci le fasse pour d\u00e9cider si Postes Canada a tard\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on indue \u00e0 r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans son ancien poste.\n[33] Peut-on dire que la conclusion de l'arbitre que Postes Canada n'a pas tard\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on indue \u00e0 r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans son ancien poste constitue une conclusion implicite que Postes Canada n'a pas fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Mme Lipp? Apr\u00e8s tout, en tirant cette conclusion, l'arbitre a explicitement rejet\u00e9 l'argument du syndicat qu'on avait \u00e9rig\u00e9 obstacle apr\u00e8s obstacle afin d'emp\u00eacher Mme Lipp de retourner travailler. Le rejet de cet argument constitue-t-il une conclusion implicite que Postes Canada n'a pas fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Mme Lipp? Selon moi, il est impossible d'affirmer cela. L'arbitre a clairement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui se sont produits comme \u00e9tant des \u00e9tapes dans le processus visant \u00e0 obtenir plus de renseignements quant \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 psychologique de Mme Lipp. Compte tenu de cette conclusion, les \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme justifiables. Toutefois, cela n'am\u00e8ne pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 la conclusion que le processus, ou des parties du processus, n'\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires.\n[34] Dans le contexte des droits de la personne, une plainte peut \u00eatre jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e m\u00eame si la discrimination n'est qu'un facteur parmi d'autres facteurs qui influencent la conduite reproch\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est possible de pr\u00e9tendre que le d\u00e9sir d'obtenir plus de renseignements peut ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul facteur qui a influenc\u00e9 la conduite de Postes Canada envers Mme Lipp; la discrimination peut \u00e9galement avoir jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le. Selon moi, il doit y avoir dans les motifs de l'arbitre une certaine indication qu'il a trait\u00e9 cette question et l'a rejet\u00e9e avant que l'on puisse affirmer que la question de la discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive. Autrement, la possibilit\u00e9 que la discrimination ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le traitement de Mme Lipp demeure toujours une question litigieuse que le Tribunal doit traiter durant son instruction sur la plainte.\n[35] De plus, alors que l'arbitre a conclu que, selon les dispositions de la convention collective et la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re d'arbitrage, Postes Canada \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d'exiger des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux additionnels, rien n'indique qu'il a examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si cette exigence a occasionn\u00e9 de la discrimination indirecte. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, on peut faire valoir que bien que, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l'obligation de se rendre \u00e0 Winnipeg pour se soumettre \u00e0 un EMI est sens\u00e9e pour les motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s par l'arbitre, elle a, n\u00e9anmoins, un effet discriminatoire car elle impose un fardeau plus lourd \u00e0 Mme Lipp qu'aux autres employ\u00e9s en raison du fait qu'elle est enceinte. Il ne semble pas que l'arbitre ait examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il y ait eu discrimination par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[36] La prochaine \u00e9tape dans l'analyse en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne consiste \u00e0 examiner si Postes Canada \u00e9tait tenue d'accommoder Mme Lipp quant \u00e0 sa grossesse et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l'a-t-elle fait sans subir de contrainte excessive. Rien n'indique que l'arbitre a examin\u00e9 si, par exemple, en exigeant que Mme Lipp se soumette \u00e0 un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg, Postes Canada \u00e9tait tenue d'accommoder Mme Lipp quant \u00e0 sa grossesse. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 que de nombreux choix quant au d\u00e9placement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts \u00e0 Mme Lipp pour qu'elle puisse aller se soumettre \u00e0 un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg et que le directeur d'usine a rejet\u00e9 la proposition du syndicat que le psychiatre de Winnipeg soit envoy\u00e9 par avion \u00e0 Regina. Toutefois, on ne sait pas si ces choix ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la peur des voyages de Mme Lipp ou pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa grossesse. Selon moi, l'arbitre n'a pas trait\u00e9 de la question de l'accommodement express\u00e9ment ou implicitement.\n[37] Enfin, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que la conclusion de l'arbitre que la tenue d'un EMI \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire avant que le processus d'accommodement ne soit entrepris est exactement la m\u00eame question que le Tribunal aurait \u00e0 traiter dans le cadre du r\u00e8glement de la plainte de Mme Lipp. En effet, Postes Canada va jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre que si l'arbitre n'avait pas conclu que la tenue d'un EMI \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e, il aurait conclu qu'elle a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation d'accommoder Mme Lipp. Par cons\u00e9quent, la conclusion que la tenue d'un EMI \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e fait obstacle \u00e0 toute analyse que le Tribunal pourrait entreprendre.\n[38] Je ne suis pas de cet avis. Dans sa plainte, Mme Lipp n'a pas pr\u00e9tendu que Postes Canada a omis de l'accommoder quant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9pression et quant \u00e0 ses troubles d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle a invoqu\u00e9 la discrimination en raison de son sexe (grossesse) et de ses d\u00e9ficiences li\u00e9es \u00e0 des blessures au cou et \u00e0 l'\u00e9paule ainsi qu'\u00e0 une fibromyalgie. \u00c0 ce titre, la conclusion de l'arbitre que la tenue d'un EMI \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire n'emp\u00eache pas de faire une analyse de la question de savoir si la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination s'est produite ou non.\n[39] Selon moi, il est hypoth\u00e9tique d'affirmer que si l'arbitre avait conclu que la tenue d'un EMI n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, il aurait conclu que Postes Canada a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation d'accommoder Mme Lipp. Rien dans les motifs de l'arbitre n'indique, et rien ne d\u00e9coule implicitement de ses conclusions, qu'il aurait tir\u00e9 une conclusion quant \u00e0 l'obligation d'accommodement de Mme Lipp. Dans son grief, Mme Lipp a fait valoir qu'elle \u00e9tait capable de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions modifi\u00e9es. Elle n'a pas pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle avait besoin d'accommodement en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes psychologiques. Si l'arbitre avait conclu que la tenue d'un EMI n'\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e, il aurait probablement ordonn\u00e9 que Mme Lipp soit r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans ses anciennes fonctions et indemnis\u00e9e pour perte de salaire. Je ne crois pas qu'il soit possible, selon l'analyse de l'arbitre, d'\u00e9mettre des hypoth\u00e8ses quant \u00e0 l'une ou l'autre conclusion qu'il aurait pu tirer.\n[40] Pour ces motifs, bien que la terminologie et la m\u00e9thodologie soient diff\u00e9rentes, je ne crois pas qu'il s'agisse en l'esp\u00e8ce d'un cas o\u00f9 les questions de droits de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9es d'une certaine mani\u00e8re par l'arbitre. Selon moi, l'arbitre n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si la conduite de Postes Canada envers Mme Lipp \u00e9tait discriminatoire. La question \u00e9tait de savoir si Postes Canada a accus\u00e9 un retard indu et si la mesure disciplinaire \u00e9tait justifiable. Il s'agit-l\u00e0 de questions diff\u00e9rentes de celles que le Tribunal serait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner. On ne peut pas non plus affirmer que l'une ou l'autre des questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de Mme Lipp ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9es implicitement dans l'arbitrage. Par cons\u00e9quent, ce volet du crit\u00e8re n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait.\nIII. LA CONCLUSION CONCERNANT LE PRINCIPE DE LA CHOSE JUG\u00c9E [41] Le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e ne s'appliquera pas \u00e0 moins que l'ensemble des trois crit\u00e8res aient \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits. Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu de ma conclusion que le premier crit\u00e8re n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que j'examine le deuxi\u00e8me et le troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re. En outre, un examen des facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires quant \u00e0 l'application des principes n'est \u00e9galement pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nA. Abus de proc\u00e9dure [42] Postes Canada a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que ce serait un abus de proc\u00e9dure que de permettre que l'affaire soit entendue par le Tribunal car l'arbitre a tranch\u00e9 d'une fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive les questions m\u00eames qui seraient trait\u00e9es par le Tribunal. Postes Canada d\u00e9clare que Mme Lipp cherche \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal tire une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de celle tir\u00e9e par l'arbitre et qu'il s'agit clairement d'un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[43] Toutefois, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, la tenue d'une audience devant le Tribunal ne constituerait pas une nouvelle audition des m\u00eames questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par l'arbitre. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que ne constituerait pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure le fait que le Tribunal entende la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nB.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] J'ai eu la possibilit\u00e9 d'examiner les observations des parties sur la question du lieu de l'audience de la plainte.\n[2] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue dans la plainte que Marc Lemire a fait de la propagande haineuse sur un site Internet nomm\u00e9 freedomsite.org, en contravention de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le plaignant, Richard Warman, pr\u00e9tend avoir visionn\u00e9 le site Web sur un ordinateur \u00e0 Ottawa, o\u00f9 il r\u00e9side. M. Lemire vit pr\u00e8s d'Oakville (Ontario), ou quelque part dans cette ville, dans la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto. Son avocate n'a pas divulgu\u00e9 son adresse exacte dans ses observations. Le site Web freedomsite.org a une adresse postale \u00e0 Toronto.\n[3] Ainsi, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que M. Lemire, un r\u00e9sident de la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto, a exploit\u00e9 un site Web, \u00e9galement situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto, sur lequel \u00e9tait affich\u00e9e de la propagande haineuse. La nature de l'Internet fait qu'il est possible de prendre connaissance de la documentation d'un endroit \u00e0 Ottawa ou d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s n'importe quel endroit dans le monde. \u00c0 mon avis, cependant, le lieu ayant le lien le plus \u00e9troit avec le comportement discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto.\n[4] M. Warman a propos\u00e9 que l'audience ait lieu \u00e0 mi-chemin entre Ottawa et Toronto, par exemple \u00e0 Kingston. Je ne vois pas la logique de cette proposition. Situ\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs heures tant d'Ottawa que de Toronto, un tel lieu ne sera convenable pour aucune des parties et n'a aucun lien rationnel avec le lieu o\u00f9 la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e serait survenue.\n[5] J'estime qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, Toronto est le lieu le plus appropri\u00e9. M. Warman pr\u00e9tend que si l'audience doit \u00eatre tenue \u00e0 Toronto, il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait que l'endroit choisi soit situ\u00e9 au centre-ville. Ses frais de d\u00e9placement seraient r\u00e9duits \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il a personnellement acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un h\u00e9bergement \u00e0 un co\u00fbt peu \u00e9lev\u00e9, et que le transport en commun est facilement accessible. \u00c0 mon avis, il s'agit d'une demande raisonnable.\n[6] M. Lemire a affich\u00e9 une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour un endroit situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 ouest de la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto, dans la r\u00e9gion d'Oakville\/Mississauga\/Etobicoke. Il doit \u00eatre capable d'aller chercher son enfant \u00e0 la garderie. Il pr\u00e9tend en outre qu'il craint de subir de l'intimidation et du harc\u00e8lement de la part de certains groupes si l'audience a lieu au centre-ville de Toronto. Je suis certain que M. Lemire peut \u00eatre accommod\u00e9 \u00e0 ces deux \u00e9gards. Au besoin, le calendrier de l'audience pourrait \u00eatre adapt\u00e9 pour lui donner suffisamment de temps pour aller chercher son enfant. Les parties peuvent \u00e9galement \u00eatre assur\u00e9es que le Tribunal ne tol\u00e9rera aucune perturbation ou intimidation, \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur ou \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la salle d'audience, et que des mesures appropri\u00e9es seront prises pour r\u00e9gler tout probl\u00e8me qui pourrait survenir.\n[7] Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en compte toutes les observations des parties, j'ordonne que l'audition de la plainte ait lieu dans le centre ou au centre-ville de Toronto. Le Tribunal \u00e9tablira l'adresse exacte et la communiquera aux parties \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure.\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] De nombreux groupes ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal l'autorisation de compara\u00eetre comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[2] Richard Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en novembre 2003. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que l'intim\u00e9, Marc Lemire, avait diffus\u00e9 des messages haineux sur un site Internet, et ce, en contravention de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). Le 24 ao\u00fbt 2005, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[3] Le 24 octobre 2005, le Tribunal a tenu une r\u00e9union de gestion de cas par conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec les parties. L'avocate de M. Lemire, Barbara Kulaszka, a mentionn\u00e9 lors de cette r\u00e9union qu'elle avait l'intention de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire concernant la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'article 13 de la Loi. Le Tribunal a fix\u00e9 des dates quant au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate de Mme Kulaszka et quant aux r\u00e9ponses de la part des autres parties.\n[4] Le 29 novembre 2005, Paul Fromm, agissant pour le compte de la Canadian Association for Free Expression Inc. (CAFE) a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au Tribunal pour lui demander de le faire reconna\u00eetre comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e afin qu'il puisse pr\u00e9senter des repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites et orales \u00e0 l'appui de la requ\u00eate de M. Lemire.\n[5] Les 12 et 19 d\u00e9cembre 2005, Douglas H. Christie a communiqu\u00e9 par \u00e9crit avec le Tribunal au nom de la Canadian Free Speech League (CFSL). Il a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que la CFSL demandait \u00e0 se faire reconna\u00eetre dans la pr\u00e9sente instance comme [Traduction] partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e qui ferait des repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites et orales quant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Marc Lemire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'article 13 [ainsi que de l'article 54] de la Loi.\n[6] Le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2005, Marvin Kurz, avocat pour la Ligue des droits de la personne de B'Nai Brith Canada, \u00e9crivant au nom de l'avocat pour le Congr\u00e8s juif canadien et pour les Amis du Centre Simon Wiesenthal pour l'\u00e9tude de l'Holocauste, a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que ces trois organismes (le groupe B'Nai Brith) demandaient \u00e0 se faire reconna\u00eetre comme parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es afin de s'opposer conjointement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de M. Lemire concernant la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'article 13 de la Loi.\n[7] Le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2005, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate de M. Lemire soit trait\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'audience sur la plainte et ne soit plus trait\u00e9e comme une question pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[8] Les trois groupes qui demandent \u00e0 \u00eatre reconnus comme parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es ont inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'ils d\u00e9siraient participer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance, mais \u00e0 des degr\u00e9s divers.\nLA CAFE\n[9] La CAFE souhaite participer \u00e0 l'audience dans son ensemble. M. Fromm a mentionn\u00e9 que la CAFE demande qu'on lui accorde les [Traduction] pleins droits de pr\u00e9senter des observations orales et \u00e9crites, de pr\u00e9senter une preuve \u00e9crite, de pr\u00e9senter [...] et de contre-interroger des t\u00e9moins.\n[10] La CAFE affirme qu'elle est un organisme sans but lucratif qui se consacre \u00e0 la promotion et \u00e0 l'utilisation maximale des garanties de la libert\u00e9 de parole, de la libert\u00e9 d'expression et de la libert\u00e9 de r\u00e9union, reconnues par la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (la Charte). Comme la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure soul\u00e8ve des questions importantes quant \u00e0 ces valeurs, la CAFE pr\u00e9tend qu'elle peut apporter une expertise unique concernant les effets, sur la Charte, des dispositions de la Loi concernant les messages haineux.\n[11] La CAFE publie r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement une lettre d'information consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 la recherche des menaces \u00e0 la libre expression, elle tient des r\u00e9unions sur des sujets qui ont trait \u00e0 la libre expression et fait des observations aux organismes l\u00e9gislatifs quant \u00e0 ces questions. M. Fromm pr\u00e9tend que l'organisme comprend [Traduction] environ 2 000 adeptes et abonn\u00e9s dans l'ensemble du Canada.\nLe groupe B'Nai Brith\n[12] Les membres du groupe B'Nai Brith demandent \u00e0 \u00eatre constitu\u00e9s parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es pour l'ensemble de la proc\u00e9dure, mais s'engagent \u00e0 limiter leur participation aux questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte. Ils s'engagent \u00e9galement \u00e0 agir conjointement tout au long des proc\u00e9dures et \u00e0 d\u00e9poser un seul ensemble d'observations. Ils coordonneront leurs efforts avec M. Warman et la Commission afin de voir \u00e0 ce qu'il n'y ait pas de chevauchement dans la preuve ou dans les observations.\n[13] M. Kurz explique dans sa demande que ses clients sont [Traduction] trois importants organismes juifs canadiens de droits de la personne. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'ils participent depuis longtemps comme intervenants dans les litiges fond\u00e9s sur la Charte concernant la propagande haineuse, la libre expression et la fixation de limites raisonnables quant \u00e0 la propagande haineuse.\n[14] Comme repr\u00e9sentants d'un groupe de personnes qui ont longtemps fait l'objet de haine et de diffamation, les trois organismes composant le groupe B'Nai Brith pr\u00e9tendent qu'elles vont apporter une exp\u00e9rience et un point de vue unique, ce qui leur permettra de faire des observations utiles diff\u00e9rentes de celles qui seront faites par la Commission et M. Warman.\nLa CFSL\n[15] La CFSL souhaite simplement contester la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de l'article 13 de la Loi. Elle n'a pas l'intention de pr\u00e9senter ou de contre-interroger des t\u00e9moins.\n[16] M. Christie pr\u00e9tend que la CFSL existe pour [Traduction] d\u00e9fendre la libert\u00e9 d'expression au Canada et pour conseiller et aider ceux dont les droits \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9s par le gouvernement. Il a comparu comme avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour la CFSL dans un certain nombre d'instances devant les cours de justice et devant les tribunaux quasi-judiciaires et il [Traduction] a d\u00e9fendu la libre expression. Selon lui, le point de vue et l'exp\u00e9rience de la CFSL peuvent \u00eatre utiles au Tribunal dans le cadre de l'examen de la requ\u00eate de M. Lemire.\n[17] Incidemment, le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2006, le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada exercerait son droit, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'article 57 de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. 1985, ch. F-7, de participer \u00e0 l'audience et de pr\u00e9senter une preuve et des observations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question constitutionnelle.\nL'analyse\n[18] L'article 50 de la Loi accorde au Tribunal un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en ce qui concerne l'attribution du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e (Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel), [2000] C.H.R.D. no 15, au paragraphe 22 (T.C.D.P.) (QL)). Il incombe au plaignant de d\u00e9montrer en quoi son expertise serait utile \u00e0 la prise d'une d\u00e9cision quant aux questions soumises au Tribunal. Le statut de personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e ne sera pas accord\u00e9 s'il n'ajoute rien d'important aux positions juridiques des parties repr\u00e9sentant un point de vue semblable (Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., [2001] C.H.R.D. no 14, au paragraphe 6 (T.C.D.P.) (QL).\n[19] Compte tenu des documents et des arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, je suis convaincu que l'ensemble des requ\u00e9rants peuvent ajouter d'une mani\u00e8re importante aux positions juridiques des parties concernant la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'article 13. Il est toutefois \u00e9vident que leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats en l'esp\u00e8ce se limitent \u00e0 la question constitutionnelle. Aucun des requ\u00e9rants n'a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 intervenir dans le dossier avant que la pr\u00e9sente question ne soit soulev\u00e9e par Mme Kulaszka comme question pr\u00e9liminaire. Les parties \u00e0 la plainte avaient re\u00e7u l'instruction de traiter la question par des observations \u00e9crites. Le Tribunal a laiss\u00e9 la porte ouverte quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d'entendre, au besoin, les observations orales \u00e0 un moment ult\u00e9rieur. Tant qu'il semblait que la question allait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme question pr\u00e9liminaire, les trois requ\u00e9rants ont sembl\u00e9 satisfaits de limiter leur contribution \u00e0 la seule question constitutionnelle.\n[20] Les requ\u00e9rants (la Canadian Association for Free Expression Inc., la Canadian Free Speech League, ainsi que le groupe compos\u00e9 de la Ligue des droits de la personne de B'Nai Brith Canada, le Congr\u00e8s juif canadien et les Amis du Centre Simon Wiesenthal pour l'\u00e9tude de l'Holocauste) se voient donc accorder le statut de personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, mais uniquement en rapport avec la question de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'article 13 et les dispositions connexes pertinentes de la Loi.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es ont le droit de pr\u00e9senter une preuve, de contre-interroger, et de pr\u00e9senter des observations, mais uniquement en rapport avec la question constitutionnelle. Elles ne pourront toutefois pas r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la preuve, le contre-interrogatoire ou les observations de M. Warman, de la Commission, de M. Lemire ou du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\n[22] Mme Kulaszka a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre de questions concernant les co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires d\u00e9coulant de la participation de parties additionnelles (comme les co\u00fbts de photocopie, de t\u00e9l\u00e9copie et de messagerie). Ces questions pourront \u00eatre trait\u00e9es lors de la prochaine r\u00e9union de la gestion de cas.\nAthanasios D.

Sangha a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte dat\u00e9e du 6 mai 2002 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Il pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9, l'Office des terres et des eaux de la vall\u00e9e du Mackenzie (l'Office) a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit pour des raisons de race, d'origine nationale ou ethnique, de couleur, de religion et d'\u00e2ge, en refusant de l'embaucher comme agent de la r\u00e9glementation (AR). Le Dr Sangha pr\u00e9tend que ce refus contrevient \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nA. L'intim\u00e9 Office des terres et des eaux de la Vall\u00e9e du Mackenzie [2] L'Office des terres et des eaux de la Vall\u00e9e du Mackenzie est un organisme de r\u00e9glementation cr\u00e9\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi sur la gestion des ressources de la vall\u00e9e du Mackenzie. La principale fonction de l'Office consiste \u00e0 traiter les demandes de permis d'utilisation des terres et les demandes de permis d'utilisation des eaux dans les r\u00e9gions de la vall\u00e9e du MacKenzie (Territoires du Nord-Ouest) o\u00f9 des accords sur les revendications territoriales n'ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 conclus, c'est-\u00e0-dire les r\u00e9gions de revendication territoriale non r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. L'Office traite \u00e9galement les demandes d'utilisation transfrontali\u00e8re des terres et des eaux dans la vall\u00e9e du Mackenzie. Dans ces cas, les demandes d\u00e9passent les fronti\u00e8res de plus d'une zone de peuplement.\n[3] Voici un certain nombre d'exemples d'activit\u00e9s qui exigent un permis d'utilisation des terres : l'utilisation de plus de 50 kg d'explosifs, l'utilisation de v\u00e9hicules de plus de 5 tonnes, l'utilisation de sites de campement pendant plus de deux cent journ\u00e9es-personnes, le stockage de plus de deux milles litres de combustible, la construction d'immeubles dont la dimension exc\u00e8de cent m\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s.\n[4] Les activit\u00e9s qui exigent un permis d'utilisation des eaux comprennent notamment : l'utilisation des eaux pour l'exploration gazi\u00e8re et p\u00e9troli\u00e8re, l'extraction et le broyage du minerai, le fonctionnement d'\u00e9quipements \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique, l'agriculture, la conservation et les loisirs.\nB. L'annonce plac\u00e9e par l'Office quant \u00e0 quatre postes d'agents de la r\u00e9glementation [5] Le 11 ao\u00fbt 2001, l'Office a plac\u00e9 une annonce dans le Vancouver Sun quant \u00e0 quatre postes d'AR dont l'\u00e9chelle salariale se situait entre 48 410 $ et 60 770 $. Les exigences quant \u00e0 ces postes \u00e9taient les suivantes :\nposs\u00e9der un dipl\u00f4me de premier cycle en sciences, en \u00e9tudes environnementales, en \u00e9cologie, en gestion des ressources ou dans un domaine connexe, poss\u00e9der deux ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience dans un domaine environnemental connexe; ou poss\u00e9der un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes postsecondaires en gestion de l'environnement ou dans un domaine connexe et poss\u00e9der trois ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience; poss\u00e9der des connaissances en mati\u00e8re de questions environnementales dans le Nord du Canada, particuli\u00e8rement en rapport avec l'exploration mini\u00e8re, p\u00e9troli\u00e8re et gazi\u00e8re; poss\u00e9der des connaissances en mati\u00e8re de technologie associ\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction des impacts des projets d'exploitation dans un environnement nordique; poss\u00e9der une connaissance fonctionnelle du logiciel Microsoft Office; poss\u00e9der une exp\u00e9rience de travail en r\u00e9gions \u00e9loign\u00e9es; \u00eatre capable de r\u00e9diger des rapports techniques; poss\u00e9der un permis de conduire de classe 5.\n[6] Les postes d'AR \u00e9taient d'une dur\u00e9e de trois ans, sous r\u00e9serve d'une p\u00e9riode probatoire de six mois, avec une possibilit\u00e9 de prorogation de deux ans.\nC. Les fonctions et les responsabilit\u00e9s d'un agent de la r\u00e9glementation [7] La principale responsabilit\u00e9 d'un agent de la r\u00e9glementation consiste \u00e0 traiter les demandes de permis d'utilisation des terres et les demandes de permis d'utilisation des eaux. Lorsque l'Office re\u00e7oit une demande de permis, elle confie celle-ci \u00e0 un AR dont la premi\u00e8re t\u00e2che consiste \u00e0 s'assurer que la demande est compl\u00e8te. Si elle n'est pas compl\u00e8te, l'AR communique avec le demandeur pour lui demander des renseignements additionnels. L'AR s'en rapporte \u00e0 une liste de contr\u00f4le, laquelle est en fait un sch\u00e9ma syst\u00e9matique des t\u00e2ches qu'un AR doit accomplir lorsqu'il re\u00e7oit une demande.\n[8] D\u00e8s que la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, l'AR l'envoie pour examen. L'Office poss\u00e8de une liste d'examinateurs. Sur cette liste figurent les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res nations, les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux pertinents ainsi que des minist\u00e8res du gouvernement des Territoires du Nord-Ouest. L'AR doit voir \u00e0 ce que tous les examinateurs re\u00e7oivent des copies de la demande, qu'ils aient l'occasion de l'examiner et de lui faire part de leurs commentaires.\n[9] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les commentaires des examinateurs, l'AR r\u00e9sume ces derniers dans un rapport qui sera examin\u00e9 par l'Office. Dans ce rapport figurent les d\u00e9tails de la demande, les commentaires des examinateurs ainsi que la question de savoir si la demande touche des questions d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public ou si elle pose un danger potentiel pour l'environnement.\n[10] Si aucun probl\u00e8me n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9, l'AR le mentionne dans le rapport et il r\u00e9dige un permis, lequel sera soumis \u00e0 l'Office pour approbation. L'Office poss\u00e8de une liste normalis\u00e9e des conditions et celles qui sont pertinentes sont inscrites sur le permis. Si le rapport fait \u00e9tat de probl\u00e8mes, l'Office prendra une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 ceux-ci.\n[11] Les AR passent beaucoup de temps \u00e0 communiquer avec les demandeurs et les examinateurs. Ce travail exige que les AR fassent des appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, \u00e9crivent, ou envoient des courriels aux demandeurs afin d'obtenir plus de renseignements ou afin de r\u00e9pondre aux demandes de renseignements des demandeurs quant \u00e0 savoir o\u00f9 en est rendue leur demande. Il existe un d\u00e9lai prescrit par la loi quant \u00e0 l'examen des demandes et quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance de la d\u00e9cision de l'Office. Les AR doivent rencontrer ces d\u00e9lais.\n[12] Les AR doivent souvent communiquer \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises avec les examinateurs afin que ceux-ci envoient leurs commentaires de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que le rapport puisse \u00eatre pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Office et que celui-ci puisse rendre une d\u00e9cision dans le d\u00e9lai imparti.\n[13] Les AR doivent poss\u00e9der une certaine connaissance, non exhaustive, des questions techniques figurant dans la demande. Une expertise technique plus \u00e9labor\u00e9e peut \u00eatre obtenue aupr\u00e8s de l'AR principal ou aupr\u00e8s de consultants externes.\n[14] Il est \u00e9galement important que les AR poss\u00e8dent une certaine connaissance des r\u00e9gions nordiques, qu'ils comprennent notamment les questions environnementales touchant ces r\u00e9gions. Ils doivent avoir v\u00e9cu dans les r\u00e9gions nordiques et ils doivent poss\u00e9der une certaine connaissance des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\nD. La s\u00e9lection des postulants pour l'entrevue [15] L'Office a re\u00e7u 38 demandes quant aux quatre postes d'AR. Sur les 38 postulants, deux poss\u00e9daient une douzi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e, six poss\u00e9daient des dipl\u00f4mes, 22 poss\u00e9daient des baccalaur\u00e9ats, six poss\u00e9daient des ma\u00eetrises et deux poss\u00e9daient des doctorats.\n[16] Un comit\u00e9 d'entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 d'examiner les demandes re\u00e7ues et de d\u00e9cider \u00e0 quels postulants l'Office ferait passer une entrevue. Le comit\u00e9 d'entrevue \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de Wanda Anderson, directrice des finances et de l'administration, Karl Lauten, directeur des examens r\u00e9glementaires, Peter Lennie-Misgeld, agent principal de la r\u00e9glementation. Chacune de ces personnes a examin\u00e9 les demandes et a dress\u00e9 une liste des postulants \u00e0 qui on devrait faire passer une entrevue.\n[17] Le comit\u00e9 d'entrevue a choisi 12 postulants pour les entrevues. Il a \u00e9limin\u00e9 tous les postulants qui poss\u00e9daient une douzi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e, 71 p. 100 de ceux qui poss\u00e9daient un dipl\u00f4me, 60 p. 100 de ceux qui poss\u00e9daient un baccalaur\u00e9at et tous ceux qui poss\u00e9daient un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures, \u00e0 l'exception du Dr Sangha. Il y a lieu de croire que l'Office a utilis\u00e9 le niveau d'\u00e9ducation comme crit\u00e8re de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. Il s'en est servie pour \u00e9liminer les candidats sous-qualifi\u00e9s et les candidats surqualifi\u00e9s.\n[18] Mme Anderson n'a pas s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 le Dr Sangha pour l'entrevue. Elle a estim\u00e9 que, compte tenu de ses qualifications, il se lasserait rapidement de l'emploi. Karl Lauten voulait faire passer une entrevue au Dr Sangha. Il estimait que le poste de conseiller technique, lequel \u00e9tait vacant, conviendrait peut-\u00eatre au Dr Sangha. Cependant, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, l'Office n'entendait pas combler le poste. M. Lennie-Misgeld, le membre du comit\u00e9 d'entrevue qui avait le moins d'anciennet\u00e9, a affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait rang\u00e9 du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de M. Lauten en s\u00e9lectionnant le Dr Sangha pour l'entrevue.\n[19] Mme Anderson a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le comit\u00e9 d'entrevue avait discut\u00e9 de cette possibilit\u00e9. Elle a cependant clairement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, lequel n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9, que ce n'est qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du poste d'AR que le Dr Sangha a pass\u00e9 une entrevue. Le poste de conseiller technique n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9 et a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9.\n[20] Le Dr Sangha a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'on ne lui a jamais dit lors de l'entrevue que sa candidature avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour le poste de conseiller technique.\nE. La proc\u00e9dure d'entrevue [21] L'entrevue qu'on a tenue \u00e9tait une entrevue structur\u00e9e dans laquelle un ensemble de questions types \u00e9taient pos\u00e9es \u00e0 chacun des candidats interrog\u00e9s. Les intervieweurs n'ont pos\u00e9 aucune question en rapport avec les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles comme la race, la couleur, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la religion ou l'\u00e2ge.\n[22] Les questions portaient sur les comp\u00e9tences du candidat potentiel, sur ses connaissances quant \u00e0 l'Office et quant \u00e0 sa structure, sur son exp\u00e9rience, sur ses attentes salariales et sur la date d'entr\u00e9e en poste.\n[23] Chacun des candidats s'est vu accorder un pointage par les intervieweurs. Des notes d'entrevue ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises par tous les intervieweurs et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audience, \u00e0 l'exception des notes prises par M. Lennie-Misgeld car celui-ci a supprim\u00e9 toutes ses notes d'entrevue.\n[24] Sur les douze personnes qui ont pass\u00e9 une entrevue quant au poste d'AR, quatre se sont vu offrir un poste. Deux de ces personnes n'ont pas accept\u00e9 les offres, l'Office a donc offert les postes \u00e0 deux autres personnes et celles-ci ont accept\u00e9.\n[25] Le Dr Sangha n'a pas re\u00e7u d'offre. Mme Anderson l'a inform\u00e9 par courriel le 17 septembre 2001 que les postes d'AR avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts \u00e0 d'autres candidats.\ni) Le profil du Dr Sangha [26] Le Dr Sangha poss\u00e8de les niveaux d'\u00e9tudes suivants : baccalaur\u00e9at en agriculture (Universit\u00e9 du Punjab, Inde, 1972), ma\u00eetrise en planification du paysage (Universit\u00e9 technique de Berlin, Allemagne, 1983), doctorat en science de l'environnement (Universit\u00e9 technique de Berlin, 1983), certificat en gestion et planification de projets (Universit\u00e9 technique de Berlin, Allemagne, 1989).\n[27] Le Dr Sangha parle couramment l'allemand, le panjabi, l'hindi et l'anglais. Il est coauteur de deux livres et a \u00e9crit un certain nombre de documents de recherche dans le domaine de l'environnement.\n[28] Le Dr Sangha poss\u00e8de une exp\u00e9rience de travail diversifi\u00e9e. Au cours de ses \u00e9tudes en Allemagne, le Dr Sangha a travaill\u00e9 pour le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral allemand comme sp\u00e9cialiste de l'environnement et il s'est occup\u00e9 de diverses questions environnementales dans le cadre de ce travail.\n[29] En 1990, le Dr Sangha est devenu professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9 \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 agricole du Punjab et il a occup\u00e9 ce poste jusqu'en 1996, ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 il est arriv\u00e9 au Canada avec sa famille. Il a donn\u00e9 des cours en \u00e9cologie et en environnement urbain, en utilisation des terres et en conservation des ressources naturelles, en conservation des bassins hydrographiques et en plan de gestion et en \u00e9tudes d'impacts environnementaux.\n[30] Lorsqu'il est arriv\u00e9 au Canada, le Dr Sangha croyait qu'il y avait peu de possibilit\u00e9 d'emploi dans une universit\u00e9 canadienne pour un nouvel immigrant. Il a donc postul\u00e9 dans tout le Canada pour des emplois en sciences de l'environnement. Il d\u00e9sirait acqu\u00e9rir une exp\u00e9rience de travail au Canada et esp\u00e9rait que cela lui permettrait d'obtenir un poste permanent dans son domaine.\n[31] Le Dr Sangha a d'abord travaill\u00e9 comme b\u00e9n\u00e9vole pour la Langley Environmental Partners Society \u00e0 Langley (C.-B.). Il s'agissait d'un organisme communautaire qui mettait l'accent sur la restauration du bassin hydraulique. Le Dr Sangha a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un projet de plantation pour la restauration et la conservation des terres humides et il a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 cet endroit pendant environ cinq mois en 1997. Il n'a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et ne travaillait pas \u00e0 temps plein. Il a fait cela pour acqu\u00e9rir de l'exp\u00e9rience.\n[32] Pendant six mois, en 1997-1998, le Dr Sangha a travaill\u00e9 comme chercheur scientifique principal chez Kam Biotechnology Ltd \u00e0 Surrey (C.-B.). Il a travaill\u00e9 sur un projet de restauration des eaux us\u00e9es.\n[33] En1998-1999, le Dr Sangha a travaill\u00e9 pour le Fraser Valley Regional District \u00e0 Chilliwack (C.-B.) comme adjoint \u00e0 la promotion de l'environnement et au d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9ducatif, travail dans le cadre duquel il s'est essentiellement occup\u00e9 de plans de gestion des d\u00e9chets. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 parrain\u00e9 dans ce travail par DRHC dans le cadre d'un programme con\u00e7u pour permettre aux nouveaux immigrants d'acqu\u00e9rir de l'exp\u00e9rience de travail.\n[34] Entre mars 1999 et juin 2000, le Dr Sangha a travaill\u00e9 comme directeur de la production pour N.A.T.S. Nursery Ltd.\n[35] \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, le Dr Sangha a postul\u00e9 pour des postes universitaires et s'est vu offrir le poste de professeur adjoint, \u00c9tudes de l'environnement, \u00e0 la St. Cloud State University (Minnesota). Il s'agissait d'un travail \u00e0 contrat qui commen\u00e7ait en septembre 2000 et qui se terminait en mai 2001. Lorsque le contrat fut termin\u00e9, le Dr Sangha a postul\u00e9 pour un poste permanent mais ce poste n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9, et ce, pour des raisons budg\u00e9taires.\n[36] Lorsqu'il est revenu du Minnesota, le Dr Sangha a travaill\u00e9 comme jardinier paysagiste dans le domaine r\u00e9sidentiel dans la r\u00e9gion de Vancouver. Il s'agissait d'un travail manuel; il devait passer la tondeuse, sarcler, s'occuper du jardin. Il faisait cela depuis environ six mois et c'est alors qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans un accident de la route et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement bless\u00e9. Il a laiss\u00e9 tomber ce travail.\n[37] En mars 2004, le Dr Sangha a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme commis comptable \u00e0 la Gill Electric Company \u00e0 Vancouver et il occupe toujours ce poste.\nii) Les profils des six candidats qui se sont vu offrir un des postes d'AR. iii) Stephen Mathyk [38] Stephen Mathyk poss\u00e8de un dipl\u00f4me en gestion des ressources renouvelables (Lethbridge Community College, 1998), un certificat en technique de la faune et des p\u00eaches (Lethbridge Community College, 1999), un baccalaur\u00e9at en science de l'environnement (universit\u00e9 de Lethbridge, 2001).\n[39] Il poss\u00e8de quatre ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience en travail ind\u00e9pendant ainsi qu'en travail d'\u00e9quipe dans le domaine de la gestion des ressources et de la gestion des politiques environnementales. Son exp\u00e9rience de travail est la suivante : il a trait\u00e9 avec des groupes d'utilisateurs multiples, notamment des militants environnementaux, des groupes d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, des Premi\u00e8res nations et des organismes gouvernementaux. Il poss\u00e8de de l'exp\u00e9rience en questions nordiques, en technologies et techniques de restauration, en r\u00e9daction de rapports techniques et en application des lois municipales, provinciales et f\u00e9d\u00e9rales.\niv) Adrian Paradis [40] Adrian Paradis poss\u00e8de un dipl\u00f4me en gestion et mise en application d'activit\u00e9s environnementales (Lakeland College (Alberta), 1995-1997).

Pourquoi ces six candidats se sont-ils vu offrir un poste d'AR mais pas le Dr Sangha? [50] Mme Anderson et M. Lennie-Misgeld ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle le comit\u00e9 des entrevues a s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 les six candidats pour leur faire une offre. M. Lauten ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Tous les candidats re\u00e7us en entrevue se sont vus accorder un pointage repr\u00e9sentant chacune des \u00e9valuations de l'intervieweur quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle ils avaient r\u00e9pondu aux questions pos\u00e9es lors de l'entrevue. Le pointage maximum \u00e9tait de 60.\n[51] Mme Anderson a accord\u00e9 un pointage de 41 sur 60 au Dr Sangha en fonction de son appr\u00e9ciation des r\u00e9ponses que ce dernier a donn\u00e9 aux questions qu'on lui a pos\u00e9es. Elle a inscrit le mot non dans ses notes d'entrevues et a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle ne ferait aucune offre au Dr Sangha. Elle a soulign\u00e9 que le Dr Sangha \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre surqualifi\u00e9, qu'il se lasserait facilement et qu'il chercherait rapidement un autre emploi. Elle a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que le Dr Sangha \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t un homme sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans les politiques, qu'il \u00e9tait capable de bien r\u00e9pondre aux questions et qu'il semblait tr\u00e8s intelligent.\n[52] Mme Anderson a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lors de l'entrevue, aucun des intervieweurs n'a demand\u00e9 au Dr Sangha pourquoi il avait postul\u00e9 pour le poste d'AR. Aucun des intervieweurs ne lui a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu'il craignait qu'il trouverait l'emploi peu stimulant ou ennuyeux et qu'il quitterait probablement \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion.\n[53] Mme Anderson a affirm\u00e9 que le Dr Sangha a demand\u00e9 un salaire de 55 000 $. Mme Anderson a affirm\u00e9 que, s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9, il aurait obtenu ce salaire.\n[54] Mme Anderson a accord\u00e9 un pointage de 48 sur 60 \u00e0 Stephen Mathyk. Elle a inscrit le mot oui dans ses notes d'entrevues et a mentionn\u00e9 qu'on devrait faire une offre \u00e0 ce dernier. Elle a estim\u00e9 que, avec ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, ses connaissances et son exp\u00e9rience, il \u00e9tait un tr\u00e8s bon candidat. Celui-ci avait des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de mise en application et cette exp\u00e9rience serait b\u00e9n\u00e9fique pour l'Office.\n[55] Ethan Sawchuk travaillait \u00e0 la Commission inuvialuit d'administration des terres comme agent de la r\u00e9glementation. Il s'agissait d'un travail particuli\u00e8rement pertinent quant au travail offert par l'Office. Mme Anderson lui a accord\u00e9 un pointage de 45 sur 60. Ses \u00e9tudes ainsi que son exp\u00e9rience de vie dans le Nord faisaient de lui un tr\u00e8s bon candidat. Les notes d'entrevue de Mme Anderson mentionnaient que M. Sawchuk poss\u00e9dait de bonnes connaissances techniques quant aux permis d'utilisation des terres. Il poss\u00e9dait \u00e9galement une bonne compr\u00e9hension des politiques ainsi qu'une exp\u00e9rience acquise sur le terrain.\n[56] Mme Anderson a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Allen Kogiak un pointage de 37 sur 60. M. Kogiak travaillait sur le site de la mine Colomac dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, lequel site faisait l'objet d'une restauration. Mme Anderson a estim\u00e9 qu'il poss\u00e9dait une bonne connaissance de ce site minier, de ses probl\u00e8mes et de ce qui devait \u00eatre fait en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 la restauration. Il poss\u00e9dait \u00e9galement une exp\u00e9rience de vie dans le Nord. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 dans ses notes d'entrevues que celui ci devrait \u00eatre embauch\u00e9.\n[57] Adrian Paradis avait suivi un cours de deux ans \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de l'Alberta en restauration et conservation des terres et poss\u00e9dait un dipl\u00f4me en application des normes environnementales. Il poss\u00e9dait \u00e9galement de l'exp\u00e9rience de travail dans les champs de p\u00e9trole de l'Alberta. Comme un certain nombre de projets p\u00e9troliers et gaziers allaient \u00eatre entrepris dans les T.-N-O., Mme Anderson a estim\u00e9 que M. Paradis \u00e9tait un bon candidat pour les questions p\u00e9troli\u00e8res et gazi\u00e8res. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 le mot oui dans ses notes quant \u00e0 l'embauche et elle a accord\u00e9 un pointage de 45 sur 60 \u00e0 M. Paradis pour l'entrevue. Celui-ci ne poss\u00e9dait aucune exp\u00e9rience de vie dans le Nord.\n[58] Comme Allen Kogiak et Ethan Sawchuk n'ont pas accept\u00e9 les offres de l'Office, celui-ci a donc offert les postes \u00e0 Latisha Heilman et \u00e0 Andrew Hammond.\n[59] Mme Anderson a accord\u00e9 un pointage de 36 sur 60 \u00e0 Mme Heilman pour l'entrevue. Elle a soulign\u00e9 dans ses notes d'entrevues que Mme Heilman poss\u00e9dait une formation en Syst\u00e8me d'information g\u00e9ographique et que l'am\u00e9nagement du territoire \u00e9tait l'un de ces principaux int\u00e9r\u00eats. Elle a estim\u00e9 qu'elle ferait une bonne candidate pour le poste d'AR parce que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, il n'existait aucun plan d'am\u00e9nagement du territoire dans quelque r\u00e9gion que ce soit. L'Office avait avantage \u00e0 embaucher une personne qui poss\u00e8de ce genre de connaissances et de formation.\n[60] Quant \u00e0 Andrew Hammond, Mme Anderson lui a accord\u00e9 un pointage de 36 sur 60 pour l'entrevue. Celui-ci travaillait depuis au moins trois ans sur le projet de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BHP Diamond \u00e0 Yellowknife comme technicien sp\u00e9cialiste de l'environnement. Il poss\u00e9dait une exp\u00e9rience de vie dans le Nord et poss\u00e9dait une connaissance pratique quant \u00e0 l'un des sites miniers importants et quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle les mines fonctionnent dans le Nord. Elle a \u00e9galement estim\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s pertinent que M. Hammond ait travaill\u00e9 au minist\u00e8re des affaires autochtones du gouvernement des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, \u00e0 Yellowknife, comme analyste des politiques et qu'il poss\u00e9dait de l'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de n\u00e9gociations portant sur les revendications territoriales, particuli\u00e8rement en mati\u00e8re de n\u00e9gociations avec les Premi\u00e8res nations et les collectivit\u00e9s.\n[61] Karl Lauten, le directeur des activit\u00e9s de r\u00e9glementation en ao\u00fbt et septembre 2001 n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience de la plainte mais ses notes d'entrevues ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve. M. Lauten a accord\u00e9 un pointage de 48 sur 60 \u00e0 Stephen Mathyk. Il a accord\u00e9 un pointage de 41 sur 60 \u00e0 Adrian Paradis, 50 sur 60 \u00e0 Allen Kogiac et 47 sur 60 \u00e0 Ethan Sawchuk. Il a accord\u00e9 46 sur 60 \u00e0 Latisha Heilman et \u00e0 Andrew Hammond pour les entrevues.\n[62] Il est int\u00e9ressant de souligner que M. Lauten a accord\u00e9 au Dr Sangha le plus haut pointage pour l'entrevue, c'est-\u00e0-dire 52 sur 60. M. Lauten a mentionn\u00e9 que le Dr Sangha poss\u00e9dait beaucoup d'exp\u00e9rience th\u00e9orique et pratique et qu'il avait beaucoup consult\u00e9 le site de l'Office ainsi que la Loi et les r\u00e8glements. Il a cependant soulign\u00e9 que le Dr Sangha ne poss\u00e9dait aucune exp\u00e9rience de vie dans le Nord.\n[63] M. Lennie-Misgeld a expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il estimait que les six candidats qui se sont vu offrir des emplois \u00e9taient les mieux qualifi\u00e9s. Ses opinions sur ces candidats sont les suivantes :\n[64] La formation scolaire et professionnelle de Latisha Heilman \u00e9tait directement applicable au travail d'AR.\n[65] Stephen Mathyk poss\u00e9dait de l'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re d'application et l'Office cherchait \u00e0 se doter de plus de moyens en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'application des r\u00e8glements en mati\u00e8re d'environnement.\n[66] Adrian Paradis poss\u00e9dait une certaine exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation de sites et poss\u00e9dait \u00e9galement de l'exp\u00e9rience en restauration de sites de forage. Son exp\u00e9rience serait utile \u00e0 l'Office quant aux applications en mati\u00e8re p\u00e9troli\u00e8re et gazi\u00e8re.\n[67] Andrew Hammond poss\u00e9dait une pr\u00e9cieuse exp\u00e9rience de travail dans le Nord dans le domaine arch\u00e9ologique. Il avait \u00e9galement travaill\u00e9 pour l'une des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s propri\u00e9taires de mines de diamants de telle sorte qu'il poss\u00e9dait une certaine exp\u00e9rience dirig\u00e9e dans le domaine de l'environnement. Son exp\u00e9rience de travail avec les membres des Premi\u00e8res nations ainsi que son exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine arch\u00e9ologique \u00e9taient pertinentes quant aux responsabilit\u00e9s d'un AR en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'entretien de rapports et au travail avec les Premi\u00e8res nations et les groupes communautaires. Les points de vue sur l'arch\u00e9ologie et la culture sont tr\u00e8s importants pour les habitants du Nord. Ceux-ci sont tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s par ces questions lorsqu'il s'agit de demandes d'exploitation.\n[68] Allen Kogiak poss\u00e9dait de l'exp\u00e9rience de travail comme agent de la gestion des ressources pour le MAINC. \u00c0 ce titre, il \u00e9tait responsable de l'application des modalit\u00e9s des permis d'utilisation des terres, ce qui constitue l'une des principales fonctions de l'Office. Son exp\u00e9rience de l'application allait \u00e9galement contribuer au travail de l'Office. Il a \u00e9galement travaill\u00e9 sur le site de la mine Colomac, une mine abandonn\u00e9e situ\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de Yellowknife. Il poss\u00e9dait donc une combinaison d'exp\u00e9rience en application et d'exp\u00e9rience de travail sur le terrain en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la restauration.\n[69] Ethan Sawchuk travaillait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque pour la Commission inuvialuit d'administration des terres comme agent de la gestion des terres. Le r\u00f4le de cet organisme ressemble beaucoup \u00e0 celui de l'Office. Il poss\u00e9dait donc une exp\u00e9rience de travail directement applicable.\n[70] Quant au Dr Sangha, M. Lennie-Misgeld a estim\u00e9 qu'il poss\u00e9dait l'exp\u00e9rience ainsi que le niveau d'\u00e9tudes. Le poste d'AR est cependant un poste de d\u00e9butant dans le domaine de l'environnement. Le travail d'AR peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s redondant et il a estim\u00e9 qu'il ne ferait pas suffisamment appel \u00e0 l'ensemble des comp\u00e9tences du Dr Sangha. De plus, il y a peu de possibilit\u00e9 d'avancement pour les AR \u00e0 l'Office.\nG. La proc\u00e9dure qui a suivi l'entrevue [71] Apr\u00e8s que les entrevues furent termin\u00e9es, le comit\u00e9 des entrevues s'est r\u00e9uni et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 quelles personnes on ferait des offres. Il a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur les curriculum vitae, les notes d'entrevues, les personnes qui, selon lui, cadraient bien ainsi que sur les connaissances et l'exp\u00e9rience qu'elles pourraient apporter au poste. Les pointages accord\u00e9s aux entrevues ne constituaient qu'un crit\u00e8re parmi d'autres et n'\u00e9taient certainement pas le facteur d\u00e9terminant.\n[72] Les membres du comit\u00e9 des entrevues se sont tous entendus pour dire que des offres devraient \u00eatre faites \u00e0 Stephen Mathyk, Adrian Paradis, Allen Kogiak et Ethan Sawchuk car ils \u00e9taient les meilleurs candidats. Les deux autres candidats qui s'\u00e9taient class\u00e9s \u00e9taient Latisha Heilman et Andrew Hammond.\n[73] Quant au Dr Sangha, il existait un consensus au sein du comit\u00e9 des entrevues voulant qu'on ne lui offre pas de poste. Selon le comit\u00e9, le Dr Sangha \u00e9tait surqualifi\u00e9 pour le poste d'AR. Comme ce poste \u00e9tait un poste de d\u00e9butant, le comit\u00e9 estimait qu'il se lasserait du type de travail exig\u00e9 et qu'il ne cadrerait pas bien avec le poste. Les autres candidats correspondaient plus aux exigences du poste.\n[74] Robert Wooley, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral actuel de l'Office (il s'est joint \u00e0 l'Office en octobre 2001) a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Bien que M. Wooley ne travaillait pas \u00e0 l'Office lorsque les nouveaux AR ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s, celui-ci a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait examin\u00e9 le curriculum vitae du Dr Sangha et qu'il avait parl\u00e9 avec les membres du comit\u00e9 des entrevues. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il fut et est toujours impressionn\u00e9 par les titres de comp\u00e9tence du Dr Sangha. Il ne voyait cependant pas en quoi ces titres de comp\u00e9tence lui seraient utiles en tant qu'AR. Ses titres de comp\u00e9tence exc\u00e9daient de loin les comp\u00e9tences exig\u00e9es.\n[75] Pour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, M. Wooley a affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait fi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9rience qu'il avait acquise depuis plus de 20 ans en mati\u00e8re de gestion de personnes poss\u00e9dant des formations diff\u00e9rentes. Selon cette exp\u00e9rience, une personne poss\u00e9dant les comp\u00e9tences du Dr Sangha n'aimerait pas l'environnement de travail ou, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le niveau du poste, ne serait pas heureuse pendant longtemps dans ce travail.\n[76] Selon l'appr\u00e9ciation faite par M. Wooley du travail d'AR, celui-ci est fastidieux et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame plus. Ce travail peut parfois \u00eatre int\u00e9ressant, mais, la plupart du temps, il consiste en des t\u00e2ches r\u00e9p\u00e9titives, c'est-\u00e0-dire s'occuper de la paperasserie, cajoler, faire des appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, envoyer des t\u00e9l\u00e9copies et assembler des piles de documents \u00e0 faire circuler parmi les employ\u00e9s pour fin de rapport.\nH. Le roulement du personnel [77] M. Wooley a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsqu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'Office en octobre 2001, il y avait un grand roulement du personnel. Il croit que cette situation s'est quelque peu redress\u00e9e mais qu'il y a toujours un certain roulement.\n[78] M. Wooley estime que cet \u00e9tat de chose n'est pas si mauvais que cela. De nombreux membres du personnel sont jeunes et songent \u00e0 leur carri\u00e8re. Leur travail \u00e0 l'Office les met en contact avec une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d'industries et de technologies. Ils se font conna\u00eetre par des groupes d'experts-conseils, des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d'exploration ainsi que par le gouvernement. Souvent, lorsqu'ils poss\u00e8dent suffisamment d'exp\u00e9rience, ils vont travailler dans l'un de ces organismes.\n[79] D'autres membres du personnel quittent l'Office pour d'autres raisons, comme le transfert d'un conjoint ou ils sont las de vivre \u00e0 Yellowknife, ils sont las de la noirceur et du froid durant l'hiver. Certains veulent tout simplement aller ailleurs. Le probl\u00e8me du roulement du personnel est li\u00e9 au fait de vivre dans le Nord du Canada. Il s'agit l\u00e0 de l'une des raisons pour laquelle l'Office privil\u00e9gie une exp\u00e9rience de vie dans le Nord.\n[80] Selon M. Wooley, l'Office doit s'assurer qu'elle embauche des personnes qui resteront pendant un certain temps. Il est on\u00e9reux d'emmener ces personnes dans les T.N.-O. L'Office assume leurs frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement et leur donne \u00e9galement une formation continue. D'importantes sommes d'argent sont d\u00e9pens\u00e9es et si une personne d\u00e9cide que le Nord n'est pas l'endroit o\u00f9 elle veut vivre, alors ces sommes d'argent sont perdues.\n[81] Il en co\u00fbte environ 10 000 $ pour amener une personne dans les T.N.-O. et l'Office paie \u00e9galement les frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de cette derni\u00e8re lorsque son mandat a pris fin.\n[82] Mme Anderson a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le roulement du personnel \u00e0 l'Office \u00e9tait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame que dans les autres organismes du Nord. Apr\u00e8s un certain temps, les membres du personnel de l'Office cherchent \u00e0 faire avancer leur carri\u00e8re. \u00c0 l'Office, la seule possibilit\u00e9 consiste \u00e0 regarder ailleurs et c'est ce qu'ont fait la majorit\u00e9 des membres du personnel qui ont quitt\u00e9. Mme Anderson consid\u00e8re le roulement du personnel \u00e0 l'Office comme \u00e9tant le prix \u00e0 payer pour faire des affaires dans le Nord.\n[83] Quant \u00e0 la question du roulement du personnel, il y avait six agents de la r\u00e9glementation \u00e0 l'Office en octobre 2001. Il s'agissait des personnes suivantes : Elaine deBastien, Greg Smith, Janpeter Lennie-Misgeld, Darren Campbell, Emma Pike et Lori Bruno. Lennie-Misgeld, deBastien et Pike ont tous commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l'Office en 2000. Les autres ont commenc\u00e9 plus tard.\n[84] Darren Campbell a quitt\u00e9 en septembre 2001 pour des raisons personnelles. Son \u00e9pouse n'aimait pas vivre \u00e0 Yellowknife.\n[85] M. Lennie-Misgeld a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu au poste d'agent principal de la r\u00e9glementation en ao\u00fbt 2001.\n[86] Elaine deBastien a quitt\u00e9 en 2002-03. Son \u00e9poux est d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Edmonton et elle est d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9e avec lui avant la fin de son contrat.\n[87] Greg Smith a quitt\u00e9 en 2004. Son \u00e9pouse a obtenu un emploi \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital de Sudbury et il est d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 avec elle avant que son contrat de trois ans ne prenne fin.\n[88] Lori Bruno a \u00e9galement quitt\u00e9 pour des raisons personnelles. Son \u00e9poux n'aimait pas Yellowknife, alors elle a trouv\u00e9 un emploi \u00e0 Fort McMurray.\n[89] Emma Pike est all\u00e9e travailler pour le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[90] Andrew Hammond a donn\u00e9 sa d\u00e9mission avant la fin de son contrat parce que son \u00e9pouse, une m\u00e9decin, avait trouv\u00e9 un emploi en Ontario.\n[91] Latisha Heilman s'est vu offrir une prorogation apr\u00e8s la fin de son mandat de trois ans, mais elle a refus\u00e9. Elle d\u00e9sirait voyager.\n[92] Les mandats d'Adrian Paradis et de Stephen Mathyk ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prorog\u00e9s pour une dur\u00e9e de deux ans.\n[93] Par cons\u00e9quent, depuis 2001, l'Office a subi, dans les quatre ou cinq ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi, un roulement presque complet des AR. Avec le d\u00e9part de ces agents de la r\u00e9glementation, l'Office a embauch\u00e9 quatre autres agents de la r\u00e9glementation; deux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s il y a environ un an et demi et deux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s il y a sept mois. Ceux-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s dans le cadre d'un concours public qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur le site Web de l'Office. M. Wooley n'a pu affirmer avec certitude que les postes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9es dans des journaux importants.\nI. La r\u00e9action du Dr Sangha quant au fait qu'on ne lui a pas offert le poste d'agent de la r\u00e9glementation - Pr\u00e9judice moral [94] Apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, le Dr Sangha s'est en all\u00e9 chez lui confiant qu'il obtiendrait le poste. Il a dit \u00e0 sa famille que l'entrevue s'\u00e9tait bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9e.\n[95] Cependant, lorsqu'il a re\u00e7u le courriel de Mme Anderson l'informant qu'on ne lui offrirait pas de poste d'AR, il est devenu tr\u00e8s irrit\u00e9. L'obtention de ce poste signifiait qu'il travaillerait dans sa profession et qu'il obtiendrait une exp\u00e9rience de travail au Canada dans le domaine de l'environnement. Cela avait \u00e9galement beaucoup d'importance au point de vue \u00e9conomique. Il s'agissait d'un emploi bien r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 et sa famille pr\u00e9voyait le rejoindre \u00e0 Yellowknife.\n[96] Le Dr Sangha a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il est devenu d\u00e9prim\u00e9 parce qu'il n'avait pas obtenu l'emploi. Il a consult\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin de famille qui lui a prescrit des antid\u00e9presseurs. Son m\u00e9decin l'a inform\u00e9 que ces m\u00e9dicaments pouvaient avoir un certain nombre d'effets n\u00e9gatifs. Pour cette raison, il ne les a pris qu'\u00e0 l'occasion, puis, \u00e0 la fin, il a cess\u00e9 de les prendre.\nJ. Les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le Dr Sangha en vue de trouver un autre emploi - mesures d'att\u00e9nuation [97] Peu de temps apr\u00e8s que sa demande ait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e, le Dr Sangha a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme jardinier en am\u00e9nagement paysager. Il devait se d\u00e9placer quotidiennement pendant une heure dans un trafic dense et devait travailler \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur sous la pluie et le vent. Il \u00e9tait tellement \u00e9puis\u00e9 par ce travail qu'il n'avait aucun temps, ni aucune \u00e9nergie \u00e0 consacrer \u00e0 la recherche d'un autre emploi.\n[98] Apr\u00e8s un certain temps, le Dr Sangha a de nouveau commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher un emploi. Il a envoy\u00e9 environ 15 curriculum vitae, il a pass\u00e9 deux ou trois entrevues mais il n'a re\u00e7u aucune offre. Il a appliqu\u00e9 pour des emplois au gouvernement ainsi que dans le secteur priv\u00e9. Parfois, les emplois annonc\u00e9s avaient trait \u00e0 sa sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9, parfois non. M\u00eame si les emplois n'avaient pas trait \u00e0 sa sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9, il postulait quand m\u00eame.\n[99] Le Dr Sangha s'est inform\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la St. Cloud State University pour voir s'il n'y aurait pas une possibilit\u00e9 d'emploi et il s'est \u00e0 nouveau fait r\u00e9pondre par la n\u00e9gative.\n[100] Depuis qu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 Gill Electric, le Dr Sangha n'a postul\u00e9 pour aucun autre emploi.\ni) Les revenus gagn\u00e9s par le Dr Sangha depuis 2001 [101] Le Dr Sangha a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de ses revenus ainsi que ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus. Ces documents faisaient mention de revenus de toutes sources de 62 701 $.\n[102] Le Dr Sangha a \u00e9galement une entente avec la Columbia State University. Son nom est mentionn\u00e9 dans le site Web de cette institution comme professeur en hygi\u00e8ne et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail. Il s'agit d'une universit\u00e9 en ligne qui offre des cours en ligne.\n[103] Le site Web montre \u00e9galement que le Dr Sangha a donn\u00e9 des cours pour la Columbia State University, notamment en toxicologie, en traitement des d\u00e9chets, en pr\u00e9vention de la pollution, en hygi\u00e8ne du travail et en technologie de pointe de contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 de l'air. Le Dr Sangha a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'enseigne pas \u00e0 des \u00e9tudiants, mais qu'il dialogue avec les \u00e9tudiants par courriel ou par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.\n[104] Le Dr Sangha a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la Columbia State University au cours de 2003. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, il ne s'agit pas d'un poste \u00e0 temps plein, il ne re\u00e7oit pas de salaire r\u00e9gulier mais il re\u00e7oit des honoraires variant entre 300 $ et 600 $ pour chaque affectation. Il travaille toujours pour la Columbia State University. Il affirme qu'il fait cela afin de garder le contact avec le milieu acad\u00e9mique.\nK. Le redressement demand\u00e9 par le Dr Sangha [105] Le Dr Sangha demande une indemnisation de trois ann\u00e9es de salaire, \u00e0 55 000 $ par ann\u00e9e, ce qui constitue son revenu potentiel en tant qu'AR. Il demande \u00e9galement que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l'Office de l'embaucher comme AR \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion.\n[106] Le Dr Sangha demande une indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Il demande \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard un montant situ\u00e9 dans le milieu de la fourchette, compte tenu du maximum de 20 000 $.\n[107] La Commission demande que l'Office modifie sa politique et travaille de concert avec la Commission afin de voir \u00e0 ce que ce type de discrimination ne se produise plus \u00e0 l'avenir.\n[108] Quant \u00e0 la demande d'embauche comme AR du Dr Sangha, M. Wooley a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que des r\u00e8glements futurs de revendications territoriales pourraient entra\u00eener une r\u00e9duction importante du personnel de l'Office. Apr\u00e8s chaque r\u00e8glement de revendication territoriale, la comp\u00e9tence de l'Office de d\u00e9livrer des permis d'utilisation des terres et des permis d'utilisation des eaux ne vaudrait que pour les r\u00e9gions qui n'ont pas encore fait l'objet d'un r\u00e8glement et que pour les demandes transfrontali\u00e8res.\n[109] Le personnel de l'Office pourrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duit \u00e0 cinq ou six employ\u00e9s parmi lesquels on retrouverait le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et le chef de bureau, lesquels s'occuperaient des budgets, et deux ou trois AR. M. Wooley r\u00e9siste donc \u00e0 la demande du Dr Sangha d'\u00eatre embauch\u00e9 comme AR.\n[110] Quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si un AR est prorog\u00e9, M. Wooley a affirm\u00e9 qu'il avait comme politique de tenter d'assurer la stabilit\u00e9 du personnel. Si un AR est un bon employ\u00e9 et que l'Office est satisfait de son travail, celui-ci peut s'attendre \u00e0 \u00eatre prorog\u00e9, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pour deux ann\u00e9es de plus, \u00e0 moins que l'Office ait vraiment beaucoup moins de travail.\nL. L'utilisation de l'argument de la surqualification lors de la s\u00e9lection des postulants [111] La Commission et le plaignant font valoir que les d\u00e9cisions de ne pas embaucher des postulants surqualifi\u00e9s ont un effet n\u00e9gatif sur les immigrants appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles. La surqualification est un crit\u00e8re qu'il ne convient pas d'appliquer \u00e0 ce groupe particulier. Ce crit\u00e8re comprend un certain nombre d'hypoth\u00e8ses, lesquelles ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement valides, quant au groupe et quant \u00e0 ses motivations.\n[112] La Commission et le plaignant pr\u00e9tendent \u00e9galement qu'une pratique ou une politique qui consiste \u00e0 ne pas embaucher les personnes surqualifi\u00e9es \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 de la discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des travailleurs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s.\nM. Le t\u00e9moignage d'expert du Dr Jeffrey Reitz [113] La Commission et le plaignant ont appel\u00e9 le Dr Jeffrey Reitz \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner en leur nom \u00e0 titre d'expert. Le Dr Reitz est professeur de sociologie, R.F. Harney Professor of Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies et directeur du Graduate Collaborative Program in Ethnic and Pluralism Studies, \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Toronto.\n[114] Le Dr Reitz poss\u00e8de 35 ans d'exp\u00e9rience en recherches sociologiques et en enseignement sur des sujets g\u00e9n\u00e9raux comme la race, les relations ethniques et l'immigration. La plus grande partie de ces recherches porte sur l'emploi des immigrants et des minorit\u00e9s visibles ainsi que sur les obstacles \u00e0 l'emploi des minorit\u00e9s, notamment la discrimination. Le Dr Reitz a publi\u00e9 sept livres, des monographies, de nombreux articles, des chapitres de livres et r\u00e9viser des livres dans lesquels il s'est pench\u00e9 sur ces sujets ainsi que sur des sujets connexes.\n[115] Le Dr Reitz a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 pour donner une opinion d'expert quant aux questions touchant la race, les relations ethniques et l'immigration, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles se rapportent \u00e0 l'emploi.\n[116] La th\u00e8se d'ensemble qui ressort du t\u00e9moignage du Dr Reitz est que le fait de ne pas embaucher des postulants surqualifi\u00e9s entra\u00eenent des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives, particuli\u00e8rement sur les immigrants appartenant aux minorit\u00e9s visibles. Les postulants surqualifi\u00e9s sont ceux dont l'instruction et l'exp\u00e9rience d\u00e9passent largement celles qui sont exig\u00e9es pour un emploi particulier.\n[117] Le Dr Reitz d\u00e9finit les immigrants comme \u00e9tant des r\u00e9sidents canadiens n\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger, peu importe depuis combien de temps ils s\u00e9journent au Canada et peu importe qu'ils soient citoyens canadiens ou non. Depuis les ann\u00e9es 70, la majorit\u00e9 des immigrants au Canada proviennent d'Asie, des Cara\u00efbes, de l'Am\u00e9rique latine et de l'Afrique. Les immigrants au Canada qui proviennent de ces r\u00e9gions sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s raciales ou visibles au Canada.\n[118] Le Dr Reitz a cinq conclusions \u00e0 l'appui.\ni) Les degr\u00e9s d'instruction et d'exp\u00e9rience des immigrants et des minorit\u00e9s visibles [119] La premi\u00e8re conclusion : les immigrants, en moyenne, poss\u00e8dent un degr\u00e9 d'instruction plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que les Canadiens de naissance. Le Dr Reitz souligne que les immigrants qui arrivent au Canada depuis les ann\u00e9es 70 et qui, en majorit\u00e9, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles, poss\u00e8dent des degr\u00e9s d'instruction \u00e9lev\u00e9s et une grande partie d'entre eux sont des professionnels comp\u00e9tents. Selon le recensement effectu\u00e9 au Canada en 1996, les immigrants ont en moyenne 0,4 ann\u00e9e d'instruction de plus que les Canadiens de naissance. Et, avec les nouveaux immigrants, la tendance s'amplifie au point que le degr\u00e9 d'instruction des immigrants serait presque de 0,6 ann\u00e9e d'instruction de plus que le degr\u00e9 d'instruction des Canadiens de naissance.\n[120] Selon le Dr Reitz, cela est d\u00fb au fait que la majorit\u00e9 des immigrants au Canada sont des immigrants ind\u00e9pendants ou \u00e9conomiques qui sont choisis selon un syst\u00e8me de pointage. Selon le Dr Reitz, le recensement effectu\u00e9 au Canada en 1996 r\u00e9v\u00e9lait que les immigrants en \u00e2ge de travailler qui sont arriv\u00e9s dans les cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es poss\u00e9daient en moyenne 14 ann\u00e9es d'\u00e9tudes et pr\u00e8s de 30 p. 100 d'entre eux poss\u00e9daient des dipl\u00f4mes universitaires. Parmi les nouveaux immigrants, ceux qui sont arriv\u00e9s en 2000 par exemple, environ 45 p. 100 d'entre eux poss\u00e9daient des dipl\u00f4mes universitaires.\nii) Les obstacles \u00e0 l'emploi qui touchent les immigrants et les minorit\u00e9s visibles [121] La deuxi\u00e8me conclusion : les immigrants appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles sont confront\u00e9s \u00e0 des obstacles lorsqu'ils postulent pour un emploi qui convient \u00e0 leur degr\u00e9 de comp\u00e9tence. Ces obstacles obligent les immigrants appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles qui sont hautement qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 chercher des emplois qui demandent moins de comp\u00e9tence.\n[122] Le Dr Reitz a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, selon les recherches, il existe divers types d'obstacle \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances pour les immigrants. Ces obstacles comprennent les pratiques d'embauche discriminatoires fond\u00e9es sur la race, le statut d'immigrant ou l'origine; l'ignorance des employeurs quant aux \u00e9tudes faites \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger; l'absence de cr\u00e9dit quant \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9rience de travail acquise \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger; aucune exp\u00e9rience de travail au Canada; le refus des organismes de d\u00e9livrance de permis de reconna\u00eetre les \u00e9tudes faites \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger ainsi que l'exp\u00e9rience acquise \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger; l'absence de contacts sociaux permettant l'acc\u00e8s au march\u00e9 du travail.\n[123] Le Dr Reitz renvoie \u00e0 diverses \u00e9tudes et \u00e0 divers rapports qui r\u00e9v\u00e8lent qu'un nombre important d'immigrants \u00e9prouvent des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 faire reconna\u00eetre leurs comp\u00e9tences. Un nombre important de personnes (20 p. 100) appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles estiment qu'il y a discrimination en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\n[124] Le Dr Reitz a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 des analyses comparatives (recensements et sondages sur le march\u00e9 du travail) entre les r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations des immigrants et les r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations des Canadiens de naissance. Ces \u00e9tudes ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nles immigrants re\u00e7oivent une prime de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration beaucoup moins importante quant \u00e0 leur degr\u00e9 d'instruction et quant \u00e0 leur exp\u00e9rience de travail. les immigrants appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles gagnent beaucoup moins cher que les immigrants qui n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles.\n[125] Les analyses de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration fournissent une estimation quant \u00e0 savoir combien les immigrants auraient gagn\u00e9 en rempla\u00e7ant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants (comme l'exp\u00e9rience de travail, les \u00e9tudes) dans l'\u00e9quation relative aux revenus des Canadiens.\n[126] Cette analyse r\u00e9v\u00e8le que si les immigrants recevaient une pleine r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration (selon les donn\u00e9es concernant les Canadiens) pour leurs ann\u00e9es d'\u00e9tudes et leur exp\u00e9rience de travail (aucune escompte fond\u00e9e sur l'origine), leurs revenus augmenteraient de 15 milliards de dollars. D'autres analyses donnent \u00e0 penser qu'un montant de 2,4 milliards de dollars (16 p. 100) sur ce manque \u00e0 gagner est attribuable \u00e0 une sous-utilisation des comp\u00e9tences.\niii) La repr\u00e9sentation des immigrants dans les emplois de haute qualification [127] La troisi\u00e8me conclusion : en cons\u00e9quence des obstacles, les immigrants sont sous-repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans les emplois de professionnels ou de gestionnaires hautement qualifi\u00e9s, c'est-\u00e0-dire les emplois du savoir, et sont surrepr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans les emplois qui demandent peu de comp\u00e9tence, et ce, en comparaison des Canadiens qui poss\u00e8dent les m\u00eames titres de comp\u00e9tence.\n[128] Selon le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Reitz, il arrive souvent que les comp\u00e9tences des immigrants qui occupent des emplois qui demandent peu de comp\u00e9tence soient beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es que celles des Canadiens qui occupent le m\u00eame emploi.\n[129] Le Dr Reitz a cit\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes qui d\u00e9montrent que, pour les personnes hautement qualifi\u00e9es, les immigrants sont sous-repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans les emplois du savoir. Les emplois du savoir sont ceux dans lesquels une forte proportion de travailleurs ont fait des \u00e9tudes universitaires (p. ex., dans les sciences, en ing\u00e9nierie, en sant\u00e9, dans l'enseignement, dans les professions lib\u00e9rales). Le recensement de 1996 r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, dans les emplois du savoir, 35 p. 100 des employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient des immigrants de sexe masculin poss\u00e9dant un baccalaur\u00e9at par rapport \u00e0 59 p. 100 des employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient des Canadiens de sexe masculin poss\u00e9dant les m\u00eames comp\u00e9tences; 59 p. 100 des employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient des immigrants de sexe masculin poss\u00e9dant des dipl\u00f4mes d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures alors que 79 p. 100 des employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient des Canadiens de sexe masculin poss\u00e9dant les m\u00eames comp\u00e9tences.\n[130] Pour les femmes, l'\u00e9cart est encore plus grand : 49 p. 100 des employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient des immigrantes de sexe f\u00e9minin poss\u00e9dant un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures alors que 78 p. 100 des employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient des Canadiennes poss\u00e9dant un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures.\n[131] De 1981 \u00e0 1996, l'importance des emplois du savoir et les degr\u00e9s de comp\u00e9tence des immigrants ont augment\u00e9. Toutefois, la diff\u00e9rence (par rapport aux Canadiens) en r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et en repr\u00e9sentation a \u00e9galement augment\u00e9. La repr\u00e9sentation en immigrants dans les emplois du savoir a diminu\u00e9 en chiffres absolus de 1981 \u00e0 1996.\n[132] Le Dr Reitz a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que l'analyse des donn\u00e9es de 1996 r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement que, pour les emplois du savoir dans leur ensemble, les immigrants ont plus de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 acc\u00e9der aux emplois de gestionnaire qu'aux emplois de professionnel.\n[133] Comme ils se voient refuser du travail dans les emplois du savoir correspondant \u00e0 leur degr\u00e9 de comp\u00e9tence et qu'ils font face \u00e0 une comp\u00e9tition plus importante en mati\u00e8re d'instruction dans les emplois qui demandent moins de comp\u00e9tence, les immigrants aboutissent souvent dans des les emplois qui demandent le moins de comp\u00e9tence.\n[134] Des \u00e9tudes r\u00e9centes (reposant sur les donn\u00e9es du recensement de 2001) r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que parmi les nouveaux immigrants qui poss\u00e8dent un dipl\u00f4me universitaire et qui ont travaill\u00e9 entre 1999 et 2001, au moins 25 p. 100 d'entre eux occupaient des emplois n'exigeant pas plus qu'un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes secondaires, et ce, par rapport \u00e0 12 p. 100 des dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s universitaires canadiens appartenant au m\u00eame groupe d'\u00e2ge en 2001, une surrepr\u00e9sentation des minorit\u00e9s visibles de l'ordre de 2 fois plus.\n[135] Dans le groupe des personnes plus \u00e2g\u00e9es, c'est-\u00e0-dire entre 45 et 54 ans, la proportion de dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s universitaires appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles travaillant dans des emplois qui demandent peu de comp\u00e9tence \u00e9tait de 38 p. 100, ce qui est 4 fois plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que le pourcentage correspondant pour les Canadiens de naissance appartenant au m\u00eame groupe d'\u00e2ge.\niv) Pourquoi les immigrants acceptent-ils du travail pour lequel ils sont surqualifi\u00e9s. [136] La quatri\u00e8me conclusion : les immigrants acceptent souvent du travail pour lequel ils sont surqualifi\u00e9s parce qu'ils se voient refuser les emplois qui correspondent \u00e0 leur degr\u00e9 de comp\u00e9tence.\n[137] Selon le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Reitz, les immigrants qui arrivent au Canada proviennent de pays dans lesquels les possibilit\u00e9s d'avancement sur le plan \u00e9conomique sont beaucoup plus limit\u00e9es qu'au Canada. Pour l'immigrant ind\u00e9pendant, l'am\u00e9lioration de ses possibilit\u00e9s d'avancement sur le plan \u00e9conomique constitue la principale raison pour laquelle il veut immigrer.\n[138] Les points de comparaison des immigrants ne sont pas les emplois d\u00e9tenus par des Canadiens poss\u00e9dant les m\u00eames comp\u00e9tences. Ce sont les emplois d\u00e9tenus dans leurs pays d'origine par des personnes poss\u00e9dant les m\u00eames comp\u00e9tences. Cette comparaison penche en faveur du Canada, malgr\u00e9 les obstacles qui existent au Canada quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\n[139] Toutefois, le Dr Reitz a soulign\u00e9 que, m\u00eame s'ils veulent avancer et surmonter ces obstacles \u00e0 l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des emplois de niveau plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, il arrive souvent qu'ils ne soient pas capables d'y arriver, et ce, pour diverses raisons. Par exemple, ils ne sont pas capables de trouver des fonds pour payer les \u00e9tudes qui leur permettraient d'avancer ou ils ne peuvent pas se permettre de cesser de travailler temporairement pour se consacrer \u00e0 des \u00e9tudes sans compromettre l'\u00e9ducation de leurs enfants. Sur ce dernier point, ils peuvent avoir comme projet d'avenir de faire en sorte que la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration qui suit ait une meilleure vie.\nv) Les travailleurs surqualifi\u00e9s donnent-ils moins satisfaction? [140] La cinqui\u00e8me conclusion : il n'existe aucun principe en mati\u00e8re de ressources humaines concernant l'embauche de travailleurs surqualifi\u00e9s.\n[141] Selon le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Reitz, il existe de nombreux mythes parmi les praticiens quant aux deux aspects de cette question. Les \u00e9tudes portant sur les travailleurs surqualifi\u00e9s \u00e9tayent \u00e0 la fois les r\u00e9sultats positifs et \u00e0 la fois les r\u00e9sultats n\u00e9gatifs. Selon l'\u00e9tude Hersch (1995), les travailleurs qui fournissent un bon rendement n\u00e9cessitent moins de formation, obtiennent plus d'avancement mais changent plus souvent d'emploi. La plupart des \u00e9tudes sur le march\u00e9 du travail montrent que les travailleurs surqualifi\u00e9s gagnent plus cher que les autres travailleurs dans leur domaine.\n[142] Toutefois, selon le Dr Reitz, il ne semble exister aucune \u00e9tude qui porte pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur les immigrants. Sa position est que le roulement du personnel est caus\u00e9 par les occasions qui se pr\u00e9sentent. Mais, pour les immigrants, les obstacles les emp\u00eachent de saisir ces occasions de telle sorte que le probl\u00e8me du roulement du personnel est peut-\u00eatre moins important quant il s'agit d'immigrants appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles.\n[143] Le Dr Reitz reconna\u00eet que la plus grande partie des donn\u00e9es statistiques sur lesquelles il s'est fond\u00e9 pour faire son analyse provient de renseignements donn\u00e9s par les personnes vis\u00e9es. Ces renseignements refl\u00e8tent ce que les personnes estiment \u00eatre leur niveau d'\u00e9tudes. Il reconna\u00eet \u00e9galement qu'il n'existe aucun moyen d'\u00e9tablir l'\u00e9quivalence des \u00e9tudes mentionn\u00e9es dans les renseignements fournis par les personnes vis\u00e9es.\n[144] On a demand\u00e9 au Dr Reitz si les postulants canadiens \u00e9taient touch\u00e9s dans la m\u00eame mesure que les immigrants appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible lorsqu'il est question de politique interdisant l'embauche de personnes surqualifi\u00e9s.\n[145] Le Dr Reitz a r\u00e9pondu que quiconque n'obtient pas un emploi pour lequel il est qualifi\u00e9 sera manifestement touch\u00e9. La question consiste \u00e0 savoir quelle personne est la plus susceptible de faire partie de ce groupe de postulants. La preuve indique que, pour l'ensemble des raisons que le Dr Reitz a avanc\u00e9es, cette personne sera vraisemblablement un immigrant appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible. Donc, s'il existe une politique interdisant l'embauche de personnes surqualifi\u00e9es, l'immigrant est la personne qui ne sera pas s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e.\nN. Les travailleurs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s - la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge [146] Le Dr Reitz a avanc\u00e9 que le fait de ne pas embaucher de personnes surqualifi\u00e9es a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant une source de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des travailleurs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s. Le Dr Sangha fait partie de ce groupe. On pr\u00e9tend que les travailleurs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s qui ont perdu leur emploi et qui d\u00e9sirent continuer \u00e0 travailler doivent postuler pour des emplois de niveau d'entr\u00e9e en raison du manque de possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi \u00e0 leur niveau d'emploi et \u00e0 leur niveau de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ant\u00e9rieurs. Toutefois, en raison de leur longue exp\u00e9rience et de leurs r\u00e9alisations, de nombreux employeurs h\u00e9sitent \u00e0 les embaucher car ils croient qu'ils vont se lasser ou qu'ils ne s'int\u00e9resseront pas suffisamment \u00e0 un poste de niveau moins \u00e9lev\u00e9. Les employeurs invoqueront la surqualification comme raison pour rejeter les candidatures de postulants plus \u00e2g\u00e9s.\nO. L'expert de l'Office - Le Dr Derek Chapman [147] Le Dr Chapman est professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9 en psychologie industrielle et organisationnelle \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Calgary. Il donne des cours de premier cycle en s\u00e9lection du personnel et en comportement organisationnel. Au niveau du deuxi\u00e8me cycle, il donne un s\u00e9minaire au niveau du doctorat en s\u00e9lection du personnel, un s\u00e9minaire au niveau du doctorat en recrutement et un cours avanc\u00e9 en psychologie industrielle et organisationnelle.\n[148] Le Dr Chapman d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at (psychologie et anglais, universit\u00e9 St Mary's, 1989) et une ma\u00eetrise\/doctorat (psychologie industrielle et organisationnelle, universit\u00e9 de Waterloo, 2000). Il a publi\u00e9 de nombreux articles dans des revues scientifiques dans le domaine de la s\u00e9lection du personnel, du recrutement et de la psychologie organisationnelle. Ces publications comprennent des recherches sur la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle les personnes choisissent leurs emplois et sur les facteurs qui influencent leur d\u00e9cision ainsi que des recherches ayant trait \u00e0 la compatibilit\u00e9 entre les personnes et les organismes et le roulement du personnel.\n[149] Le Dr Chapman a travaill\u00e9 pendant six ans comme officier de s\u00e9lection du personnel au minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale. Cette t\u00e2che consistait \u00e0 faire passer des entrevues \u00e0 des postulants, \u00e0 \u00e9valuer leurs titres de comp\u00e9tence, \u00e0 mener des entrevues structur\u00e9es, \u00e0 r\u00e9diger des rapports et \u00e0 effectuer des \u00e9valuations au cas pas cas de personnes quant \u00e0 environ 120 \u00e0 140 diff\u00e9rents types d'emplois.\n[150] Le Dr Chapman a travaill\u00e9 comme expert-conseil ind\u00e9pendant pour un certain nombre d'organismes et a aid\u00e9 ces derniers \u00e0 \u00e9laborer et \u00e0 valider leurs syst\u00e8mes de s\u00e9lection ainsi que leurs op\u00e9rations de recrutement, de telle sorte que les syst\u00e8mes puissent permettent de choisir les personnes qui conviennent le mieux aux postes \u00e0 combler.\n[151] Le Dr Chapman est un expert reconnu dans le domaine de la s\u00e9lection du personnel, du recrutement, de la psychologie organisationnelle et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour examiner si les m\u00e9thodes de s\u00e9lection utilis\u00e9es par l'Office pour \u00e9valuer les candidats aux postes d'AR \u00e9taient appropri\u00e9es et pour examiner la d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher le Dr Sangha. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour examiner si la pratique d'un employeur qui consiste \u00e0 exclure des candidats en raison d'un manque de compatibilit\u00e9 avec l'emploi, notamment en raison de la surqualification, est une m\u00e9thode r\u00e9pandue dans le domaine des ressources humaines.\n[152] En pr\u00e9parant son t\u00e9moignage d'expert, le Dr Chapman a examin\u00e9 l'ensemble des 38 demandes re\u00e7ues par l'Office, notamment la demande du Dr Sangha. Il a \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 la description de poste et l'offre d'emploi pour le poste d'AR.\nP. Les pratiques de s\u00e9lection du personnel, la surqualification et la compatibilit\u00e9 avec l'emploi [153] L'opinion globale du Dr Chapman est que la m\u00e9thode qui consiste \u00e0 ne pas choisir des candidats pour des emplois en raison d'une faible compatibilit\u00e9 entre la personne et l'emploi, notamment la surqualification, est une m\u00e9thode de s\u00e9lection tr\u00e8s utilis\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de ressources humaines. Un grand nombre de donn\u00e9es indiquent que les r\u00e9sultats sont d\u00e9cevants pour les personnes qui sont embauch\u00e9es dans des postes pour lesquels elles sont surqualifi\u00e9es ainsi que pour les employeurs car ceux-ci doivent payer des salaires plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s, ils sont confront\u00e9s \u00e0 un roulement du personnel, les employ\u00e9s font preuve d'une attitude qui est moins bonne, voire m\u00eame mauvaise, les employ\u00e9s donnent un moins bon rendement au travail.\n[154] Le Dr Chapman d\u00e9finit l'expression pratiques de s\u00e9lection du personnel comme \u00e9tant les proc\u00e9dures dont se servent les organismes pour tenter d'embaucher la personne qui cadre le mieux avec l'emploi qu'elles ont \u00e0 offrir. Ces proc\u00e9dures permettent de relever les connaissances, les comp\u00e9tences et les capacit\u00e9s qui sont exig\u00e9es pour un emploi particulier ainsi que les buts vis\u00e9s par la s\u00e9lection.\n[155] Le Dr Chapman n'accepte pas la proposition selon laquelle, dans le cas d'une personne surqualifi\u00e9e, un employeur doit regarder au-del\u00e0 du crit\u00e8re de la compatibilit\u00e9 de la personne avec l'emploi et doit examiner la situation personnelle du candidat, c'est-\u00e0-dire ce qu'il peut offrir au-del\u00e0 de son instruction et de son exp\u00e9rience.\n[156] Pour le Dr Chapman, personne n'est surqualifi\u00e9 lorsqu'il est question de s\u00e9lection de candidats. Une personne ne devient surqualifi\u00e9e que lorsqu'elle postule pour un emploi pour lequel ses titres de comp\u00e9tence d\u00e9passent les exigences de l'emploi.\n[157] Le Dr Chapman pr\u00e9f\u00e8re utiliser le concept de compatibilit\u00e9 entre la personne et l'emploi lequel est utilis\u00e9 pour v\u00e9rifier dans quelle mesure les comp\u00e9tences d'une personne cadrent bien avec les exigences de l'emploi. Dans ce contexte, le mot surqualifi\u00e9 renvoie \u00e0 une faible compatibilit\u00e9 entre la personne et l'emploi pour lequel elle postule parce que ses titres de comp\u00e9tence officiels d\u00e9passent les comp\u00e9tences exig\u00e9es pour l'emploi.\nQ. La pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection de la personne surqualifi\u00e9e [158] Le Dr Chapman n'est pas du tout d'accord avec le Dr Reitz qu'il n'existe aucun principe en mati\u00e8re de ressources humaines concernant l'embauche de travailleurs surqualifi\u00e9s et qu'il n'existe que des mythes d'une part et d'autre de la question.\n[159] Au contraire, la s\u00e9lection de candidats en tenant compte de la surqualification est un principe et une pratique biens \u00e9tablis en mati\u00e8re de ressources humaines. La s\u00e9lection du personnel est un domaine enti\u00e8rement consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appariement de personnes \u00e0 des emplois.\n[160] Il s'agit d'un crit\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 pour un certain nombre de raisons. Dans l'ensemble, les employeurs n'ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas le temps de s'asseoir et de discuter avec chaque personne de leur vie et de leur demander d'expliquer pourquoi elle postule, alors qu'il est manifeste que les titres de comp\u00e9tence de la personne sont soit tr\u00e8s inf\u00e9rieurs ou tr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs au niveau de comp\u00e9tence exig\u00e9 pour l'emploi.\n[161] \u00c0 l'appui de son all\u00e9gation, le Dr Chapman a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9tude r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en 1992 (Bills, The Mutability of Educational Credentials : How Employers Evaluate Highly Credentialed Job Candidates). Dans cette \u00e9tude, on analysait dans quelle mesure les employeurs \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 faire passer des entrevues aux candidats dont les titres de comp\u00e9tence \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9s par rapport aux comp\u00e9tences exig\u00e9es pour l'emploi.\n[162] Selon cette \u00e9tude, 72 p. 100 des employeurs n'embaucheraient pas de candidats dont les titres de comp\u00e9tence ne cadrent aucunement avec l'emploi. Cela refl\u00e8te l'importance de l'\u00e9limination des candidats qui poss\u00e8dent ce genre de titres de comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de l'entrevue.\nR. Les raisons justifiant l'\u00e9limination des personnes surqualifi\u00e9es [163] Selon le Dr Chapman, l'embauche d'une personne qui ne cadre pas bien avec un emploi comporte un certain nombre de cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 la fois pour l'organisme qui embauche et \u00e0 la fois pour la personne embauch\u00e9e. Une \u00e9tude r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en 2000 (Kristof-Brown, Consequences of Individual's Fit at Work) a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il existe une forte relation entre la compatibilit\u00e9 avec l'emploi, la satisfaction professionnelle et le degr\u00e9 d'attachement \u00e0 l'organisme. Un employ\u00e9 qui cadre bien avec les exigences d'un emploi est beaucoup moins susceptible de souhaiter quitter cet emploi.\n[164] Par contre, un faible degr\u00e9 de compatibilit\u00e9 entre la personne et l'emploi m\u00e8ne rapidement \u00e0 un roulement volontaire du personnel. Il s'agit d'un facteur tr\u00e8s important pour l'employeur. Selon le Dr Chapman, il en est ainsi parce que les pratiques d'embauche qui sont susceptibles d'entra\u00eener un roulement \u00e9lev\u00e9 du personnel comportent un co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour l'organisme. Habituellement, il en co\u00fbte environ 30 p. 100 du salaire d'une personne pour embaucher cette derni\u00e8re. Ces co\u00fbts comprennent les frais de publicit\u00e9, les frais de recrutement dans le cas des emplois de cadre, les frais de transport des personnes qui doivent prendre l'avion pour se rendre \u00e0 une entrevue et les frais li\u00e9s au temps consacr\u00e9 aux entrevues par les intervieweurs.\n[165] Il peut \u00e9galement y avoir des co\u00fbts \u00e9lev\u00e9s de formation car on doit enseigner aux nouveaux employ\u00e9s les t\u00e2ches li\u00e9es \u00e0 leur emploi. Il y a toujours une p\u00e9riode de temps pendant laquelle les personnes ne sont pas aussi productives qu'elles devraient l'\u00eatre parce qu'elles sont en train d'apprendre le travail.\n[166] Le Dr Chapman a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il existe des pratiques de s\u00e9lection et de recrutement con\u00e7ues express\u00e9ment pour r\u00e9duire la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il y ait roulement du personnel. Il ne fait aucun doute que l'embauche sur le fondement de la compatibilit\u00e9 avec l'emploi constitue l'une des pratiques qui permet le mieux d'\u00e9viter le roulement du personnel.\n[167] On a demand\u00e9 au Dr Chapman si parfois un employeur devrait examiner non seulement les titres de comp\u00e9tence du candidat mais \u00e9galement sa situation personnelle. Il se peut qu'un candidat soit surqualifi\u00e9 mais que, pour des raisons personnelles, il soit plus susceptible de donner un bon rendement et de garder son emploi.\n[168] Le Dr Chapman a r\u00e9pondu que, parfois, on \u00e9tait justifier d'embaucher des personnes qui ont quelque chose de plus \u00e0 offrir. Cependant, le march\u00e9 du travail fonctionne de telle mani\u00e8re que les personnes tendent \u00e0 se diriger vers les emplois les mieux r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s qu'ils peuvent obtenir et qui correspondent \u00e0 leur ensemble de comp\u00e9tences.\n[169] On pourrait justifier l'embauche d'une personne qui ne poss\u00e8de pas les comp\u00e9tences exig\u00e9es mais qui apporte quelque chose d'autre \u00e0 l'organisme. Prenons par exemple le cas d'un candidat qui ne poss\u00e8de pas de grade universitaire mais qui poss\u00e8de un dipl\u00f4me et de l'exp\u00e9rience en restauration de sites d'exploration gazi\u00e8re et p\u00e9troli\u00e8re, alors l'employeur pourrait abaisser quelque peu le crit\u00e8re de la compatibilit\u00e9.\n[170] Le Dr Chapman ne recommande cependant pas de faire cela dans l'autre sens. Selon les recherches, l'une des raisons pour lesquelles les personnes qui poss\u00e8dent des titres de comp\u00e9tence \u00e9lev\u00e9s obtiennent de bons emplois est qu'elles n'ont pas acc\u00e8s aux postes de niveaux moins \u00e9lev\u00e9s, et ce, en raison de leur surqualification. Elles sont oblig\u00e9es de demeurer sur le march\u00e9 de l'emploi jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elles trouvent un emploi plus appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Les personnes qui demeurent assez longtemps sur le march\u00e9 de l'emploi finissent par trouver.\n[171] Mais, compte tenu des faits de l'esp\u00e8ce, pourquoi l'Office devrait-il embaucher le Dr Sangha alors qu'il y a 38 candidats parmi lesquels figurent un certain nombre de personnes dont les titres de comp\u00e9tence sont plus compatibles avec le poste d'AR que ceux du Dr Sangha.\nS. Les autres cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9coulant de l'embauche de personnes surqualifi\u00e9es [172] Le Dr Chapman a relev\u00e9 d'autres cons\u00e9quences pour l'employeur quant \u00e0 l'embauche de personnes surqualifi\u00e9es. Les employ\u00e9s qui sont embauch\u00e9s et qui ne cadrent avec leur emploi sont souvent irrit\u00e9s par le fait d'occuper ces emplois. Ils savent qu'ils peuvent faire mieux. Il peut arriver qu'ils doivent travailler pour des personnes qui ne poss\u00e8dent pas le m\u00eame niveau de comp\u00e9tence et, malgr\u00e9 cela, elles doivent rendre des comptes \u00e0 ces personnes. Ces employ\u00e9s peuvent donc \u00eatre difficiles \u00e0 diriger.\n[173] Les donn\u00e9es r\u00e9v\u00e8lent \u00e9galement que les personnes qui sont surqualifi\u00e9es font preuve d'une moins bonne attitude envers l'emploi et donnent un moins bon rendement que les personnes qui cadrent avec l'emploi. Les personnes qui sont surqualifi\u00e9es peuvent faire le travail. Cependant, leur attitude est telle qu'elles ne portent pas une grande attention au travail car elles croient qu'il n'est pas tr\u00e8s important et qu'elles sont trop comp\u00e9tentes pour faire ce travail. Elles estiment que ces postes ne comportent aucun d\u00e9fi. Elles ne sont pas motiv\u00e9es \u00e0 faire un bon travail parce qu'elles estiment que le travail en question n'est pas important ou qu'il n'est pas \u00e0 la hauteur de leurs comp\u00e9tences et de leurs connaissances.\n[174] De plus, les personnes qui poss\u00e8dent des titres de comp\u00e9tence plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s demandent des salaires plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s. Cela peut entra\u00eener des co\u00fbts plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s pour l'employeur s'il est oblig\u00e9 d'embaucher des personnes qui poss\u00e8dent des titres de comp\u00e9tence qui ne sont pas exig\u00e9s pour l'emploi.\n[175] Les recherches r\u00e9v\u00e8lent \u00e9galement que des personnes qui travaillent dans des postes sous-employ\u00e9s sont plus susceptibles de souffrir de d\u00e9pression et d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 mentale. Dans une \u00e9tude notamment (Leanna and Feldman, 1995, Finding New Jobs after a Plant Closing), on a suivi des personnes qui \u00e9taient sans emploi et des personnes qui \u00e9taient sous-employ\u00e9es. Les personnes qui ont accept\u00e9 des emplois qui ne correspondaient pas \u00e0 leur ensemble de comp\u00e9tences et les personnes qui \u00e9taient demeur\u00e9es sans emploi et qui \u00e9taient rest\u00e9es sur le march\u00e9 de l'emploi souffraient du m\u00eame niveau d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de d\u00e9pression.\nT. L'utilisation par le Dr Reitz des donn\u00e9es des recensements et des donn\u00e9es sur la main-d'oeuvre [176] Le Dr Chapman a critiqu\u00e9 le fait que le Dr Reitz se soit fond\u00e9 sur les donn\u00e9es de Statistique Canada. Les donn\u00e9es des recensements rel\u00e8vent de l'autod\u00e9claration. Elles sont recueillies dans un sondage qui est envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 des personnes dans l'espoir que celles-ci y r\u00e9pondent correctement. Cependant, les r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par ces derni\u00e8res d\u00e9pendent de leur compr\u00e9hension de la situation. Il n'y a aucune mani\u00e8re objective de voir si les titres de comp\u00e9tence qui sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s sont vraiment ceux que les personnes pr\u00e9tendent qu'ils sont. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon le Dr Chapman, on doit faire preuve de prudence lorsque l'on interpr\u00e8te ces statistiques et que l'on en tire des conclusions. Il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait ne pas faire cela sans faire davantage de recherche sur le terrain pour voir ce qui motivent vraiment ces relations.\nU. Les obstacles auxquels sont confront\u00e9s les immigrants appartenant aux minorit\u00e9s visibles [177] Le Dr Chapman a affirm\u00e9 tr\u00e8s clairement qu'il estimait qu'il ne convenait pas d'embaucher des immigrants qui sont surqualifi\u00e9s pour un emploi particulier. Il ne ferait aucune distinction entre les immigrants et les autres groupes. Si les immigrants sont confront\u00e9s \u00e0 des obstacles quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances en milieu de travail, il pr\u00e9conise que l'on s'occupe de ce probl\u00e8me plut\u00f4t que donner \u00e0 une personne un emploi pour lequel elle est surqualifi\u00e9e.\n[178] Exiger que les employeurs donnent \u00e0 des personnes des emplois qui sont incompatibles avec leurs capacit\u00e9s ne constitue pas une bonne utilisation des comp\u00e9tences. Investir dans des syst\u00e8mes qui \u00e9valuent les titres de comp\u00e9tence ou qui \u00e9liminent les obstacles discriminatoires serait une mani\u00e8re beaucoup plus efficace de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me.\nV. L'appr\u00e9ciation du Dr Chapman quant \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode d'entrevue de l'Office [179] Le Dr Chapman a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, globalement, il existe deux types importants d'entrevue. Les petits organismes se servent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d'entrevues non structur\u00e9es. Dans ce genre d'entrevue, une personne s'assoit avec le candidat, examine son curriculum vitae et bavarde avec elle pendant un certain moment. Les questions peuvent varier d'un candidat \u00e0 l'autre selon les sujets qui sont soulev\u00e9s. Il n'existe aucune liste de questions. L'entrevue peut se d\u00e9rouler d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente \u00e0 la guise de la personne qui m\u00e8ne l'entrevue.\n[180] Le deuxi\u00e8me type d'entrevue est l'entrevue structur\u00e9e dans le cadre de laquelle chaque candidat se fait poser les m\u00eames questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'emploi et les r\u00e9ponses qu'il donne font l'objet d'un pointage. Comme il n'y a aucune conversation officieuse, chaque candidat est trait\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, l'entrevue est plus objective et il y a peu de chance que l'on fasse preuve de partialit\u00e9.\n[181] Le Dr Chapman a affirm\u00e9 que diff\u00e9rents types de m\u00e9thode de pointage peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s. Soit que chaque question individuelle fait l'objet d'un pointage, soit que chaque intervieweur accorde un pointage global \u00e0 la fin de l'entrevue, soit que les pointages des intervieweurs ne sont pas additionn\u00e9s.\n[182] Les pointages peuvent varier en fonction des intervieweurs, d\u00e9pendamment de leur s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ou de leur indulgence. Certains intervieweurs accordent toujours des pointages plus bas ou plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux de leurs coll\u00e8gues. Cependant, tant et aussi longtemps que le classement par ordre de rang est le m\u00eame, cela ne pose aucun probl\u00e8me.\n[183] Le Dr Chapman a affirm\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait agr\u00e9ablement surpris que l'Office se soit servi de la m\u00e9thode de l'entrevue structur\u00e9e. Tr\u00e8s peu de petits organismes disposent des ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour faire de m\u00eame. Selon lui, les questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien choisies, elles avaient trait \u00e0 l'emploi et n'avaient trait \u00e0 aucun des motifs de discrimination interdits.\nW. L'appr\u00e9ciation faite par le Dr Chapman quant au Dr Sangha [184] Le Dr Chapman a fait sa propre appr\u00e9ciation quant \u00e0 savoir si le Dr Sangha cadrerait bien avec le poste d'AR. Il a conclu que les titres de comp\u00e9tence du Dr Sangha \u00e9taient incompatibles avec les fonctions du poste d'AR. Le Dr Sangha a eu beaucoup de succ\u00e8s comme \u00e9tudiant dans les deux universit\u00e9s o\u00f9 il a \u00e9tudi\u00e9. Dans son curriculum vitae, il est mentionn\u00e9 que le premier emploi qu'il a occup\u00e9 au Canada \u00e9tait celui de chercheur scientifique principal, ce qui est conforme avec ce \u00e0 quoi on s'attend d'une personne qui poss\u00e8de un doctorat.\n[185] Comme autres emplois dont le Dr Sangha a fait mention dans son curriculum vitae, mentionnons qu'il a travaill\u00e9 comme directeur dans une p\u00e9pini\u00e8re; il a donc assum\u00e9 des responsabilit\u00e9s de gestion. Son emploi le plus r\u00e9cent dans son domaine d'expertise a \u00e9t\u00e9 professeur adjoint dans une universit\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine respect\u00e9e.\n[186] Compte tenu que le poste d'AR est essentiellement de nature cl\u00e9ricale, le Dr Sangha aurait tr\u00e8s peu l'occasion de se servir des comp\u00e9tences et des connaissances qu'il a acquises au cours de ses nombreuses ann\u00e9es d'\u00e9tudes.\n[187] Le Dr Chapman aurait \u00e9cart\u00e9 sa candidature avant l'entrevue. Donner l'emploi d'AR \u00e0 une personne poss\u00e9dant la base de connaissances du Dr Sangha ne fait que perp\u00e9tuer le sous-emploie chez cette personne.\n[188] Selon le Dr Chapman, embaucher le Dr Sangha aurait des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives pour l'organisation car celui-ci ne donnerait pas un bon rendement en raison de la lassitude, du manque de d\u00e9fi. De plus, il serait susceptible de quitter son emploi. Selon les renseignements qu'il a vus, le Dr Chapman a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s surpris que le Dr Sangha ait \u00e9t\u00e9 admis \u00e0 l'entrevue.\n[189] Le Dr Chapman a \u00e9galement certaines inqui\u00e9tudes concernant l'historique d'emploi du Dr Sangha en ce qui a trait au roulement. Celui-ci conserve ses emplois peu longtemps; il a chang\u00e9 syst\u00e9matiquement d'emploi \u00e0 quatre reprises au cours des quatre derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Cela indique normalement qu'une personne n'aime pas ses emplois et, en cons\u00e9quence, va d'un endroit \u00e0 l'autre.\n[190] Le Dr Chapman croit que bien que l'Office ait accept\u00e9 de faire passer une entrevue au Dr Sangha, m\u00eame s'il \u00e9tait manifestement surqualifi\u00e9, l'Office, en bout de ligne, a pris la bonne d\u00e9cision de ne pas l'embaucher.\nX. Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie? [191] Dans une affaire devant le Tribunal, il incombe au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la part de l'intim\u00e9.\n[192] La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la part de l'intim\u00e9 (Commission des droits de la personne de l'Ontario c. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202; Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Simpson Sears Ltd, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536).\n[193] Dans Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 A.C.F. 204, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 davantage la m\u00e9thode que le Tribunal doit utiliser. La Cour a affirm\u00e9 que le Tribunal ne devrait pas tenir compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9 avant de d\u00e9cider si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie.\n[194] Afin d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie au vu des faits de l'esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que le plaignant doit d\u00e9montrer :\nqu'il poss\u00e8de les comp\u00e9tences de base pour l'emploi; qu'il est un immigrant appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible; qu'il est surqualifi\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 l'emploi en question; que le statut de personne surqualifi\u00e9e est l'une des raisons pour laquelle il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9; qu'il existe une corr\u00e9lation entre le statut d'immigrant appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible et le statut de personne surqualifi\u00e9e.\n[195] Manifestement, le plaignant satisfait aux conditions a), b) et c). Quant \u00e0 la condition d), l'Office admet que l'une des raisons pour laquelle le Dr Sangha n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour le poste d'AR est qu'on avait estim\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait surqualifi\u00e9.\n[196] Par cons\u00e9quent, il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si le plaignant peut satisfaire \u00e0 la condition e).\nY. La preuve prima facie du plaignant [197] Selon le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Reitz, la majorit\u00e9 des immigrants qui sont arriv\u00e9s au Canada au cours des derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies \u00e9taient des personnes tr\u00e8s instruites appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles. Toutefois, les statistiques du Dr Reitz r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que, malgr\u00e9 des niveaux d'instruction comparables \u00e0 ceux des Canadiens de naissance, les immigrants sont sous-repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans les emplois du savoir.\n[198] De plus, des \u00e9tudes r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que les immigrants gagnent beaucoup moins cher que les Canadiens de naissance qui poss\u00e8dent des comp\u00e9tences \u00e9quivalentes (instruction et exp\u00e9rience de travail). Une partie importante de ce manque \u00e0 gagner est attribuable au fait que de nombreux immigrants n'utilisent pas pleinement les comp\u00e9tences qu'ils ont acquises.\n[199] Le Dr Reitz pr\u00e9tend qu'il existe une corr\u00e9lation entre la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des immigrants dans les emplois qui demandent le plus de comp\u00e9tence et la surrepr\u00e9sentation des immigrants dans les postes pour lesquels leurs comp\u00e9tences sont sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles qui sont exig\u00e9es. Comme les immigrants appartenant aux minorit\u00e9s visibles sont exclus de fa\u00e7on disproportionn\u00e9e des \u00e9chelons les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s du march\u00e9 de l'emploi en raison des obstacles \u00e0 l'emploi \u00e0 ce niveau, ils cherchent de l'emploi dans les \u00e9chelons plus bas o\u00f9 leurs comp\u00e9tences sont sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles exig\u00e9es pour l'emploi.\n[200] Donc, postuler pour un emploi pour lequel on est surqualifi\u00e9 ou occuper un poste pour lequel on est surqualifi\u00e9 est une situation \u00e0 laquelle les immigrants sont davantage confront\u00e9s. Bien que de nombreux Canadiens de naissance cherchent ou occupent un emploi pour lequel ils sont surqualifi\u00e9s, ils sont moins susceptibles de se retrouver dans cette situation parce que les Canadiens de naissance ne sont pas confront\u00e9s \u00e0 cette exclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e des emplois qui font pleinement appel \u00e0 leurs comp\u00e9tences.\n[201] Lorsqu'un employeur, comme l'Office, adopte une r\u00e8gle contre l'embauche de candidats surqualifi\u00e9s, ladite r\u00e8gle peut sembler neutre en ce sens qu'elle s'applique \u00e0 tous les candidats surqualifi\u00e9s (immigrants et Canadiens de naissance). Pourtant, elle a un effet discriminatoire sur les candidats immigrants qui sont surqualifi\u00e9s : elle impose, en raison de certaines caract\u00e9ristiques particuli\u00e8res du groupe, des peines ou des conditions restrictives qui ne sont pas impos\u00e9es aux autres travailleurs.\n[202] Quelles peines ou conditions restrictives? Tout simplement ceci : les candidats Canadiens de naissance dont la candidature est rejet\u00e9e en raison de la surqualification ont la possibilit\u00e9 de chercher du travail qui convient plus \u00e0 leurs comp\u00e9tences alors que les immigrants n'ont en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pas cette possibilit\u00e9. Ils sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 exclus des emplois convenables et ils peuvent raisonnablement s'attendre \u00e0 ce que cette exclusion continue d'exister ind\u00e9finiment. Par cons\u00e9quent, une politique ou une pratique interdisant l'embauche de candidats surqualifi\u00e9s ne touche pas les immigrants de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les autres personnes auxquelles elle peut \u00e9galement s'appliquer.\n[203] Le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Reitz \u00e9tablit qu'il existe une corr\u00e9lation entre le statut d'immigrant appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible et le statut de personne surqualifi\u00e9e. Pour cette raison, j'ai conclu que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e pour un motif de distinction illicite.\nZ. L'Office a-t-il r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la preuve prima facie? [204] En r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 cette question, on renvoie d'abord \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12; 112 N.R. 395 (C.A.F.). Dans cette affaire, le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il avait fait l'objet de discrimination en raison de son \u00e2ge car on l'avait oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre une retraite anticip\u00e9e. En traitant la plainte, le tribunal d'appel a statu\u00e9 que la discrimination doit constituer le fondement de la d\u00e9cision imput\u00e9e. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'a pas partag\u00e9 cet avis. Elle a conclu que si la discrimination ne constitue qu'un facteur parmi d'autres facteurs non discriminatoires, cela suffit pour conclure qu'il y a eu contravention \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[205] L'Office a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que le statut de personne surqualifi\u00e9e a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher le Dr Sangha. Donc, pour que l'Office r\u00e9fute la preuve prima facie, il doit r\u00e9futer la corr\u00e9lation qui peut exister entre le statut de personne surqualifi\u00e9e et le statut d'immigrant appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible.\n[206] Le Dr Chapman a critiqu\u00e9 le fait que le Dr Reitz se soit fier aux donn\u00e9es du recensement et du sondage sur le march\u00e9 du travail parce qu'il s'agit de renseignements obtenus par autod\u00e9claration et qu'ils refl\u00e8tent la perception ou la croyance de ceux qui les ont fournis. Il a soulign\u00e9 qu'il n'existe pas de v\u00e9rification objective permettant de savoir si les titres de comp\u00e9tence d\u00e9clar\u00e9s sont valides ou sont des \u00e9quivalences. Le Dr Chapman ferait preuve de prudence en interpr\u00e9tant ces statistiques et en tirant des conclusions \u00e0 partir de celles-ci.\n[207] La critique du Dr Chapman est g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle est loin de traiter pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les pr\u00e9tendues lacunes figurant dans l'analyse du Dr Reitz. Il incombait \u00e0 l'Office de prouver les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants : les donn\u00e9es du Dr Reitz quant \u00e0 la sous-utilisation des comp\u00e9tences sont inexactes ou ne sont plus exactes; les immigrants appartenant aux minorit\u00e9s visibles ne constituent pas une composante disproportionnelle de la population des personnes surqualifi\u00e9es; ils ne sont par cons\u00e9quent pas plus susceptibles que les Canadiens de naissance de postuler pour un emploi pour lequel ils sont surqualifi\u00e9s; cela \u00e9tant, il n'y aucune raison de croire que lorsqu'un employeur \u00e9tablit une r\u00e8gle contre l'embauche de personnes surqualifi\u00e9es, cette r\u00e8gle a une incidence plus importante sur les candidats appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles.\n[208] L'Office n'a pas fait cela. Je conclus que l'Office n'a pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on suffisante la preuve prima facie du plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la plainte de discrimination d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le Dr Sangha en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est fond\u00e9e. Ayant conclu \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'origine nationale ou ethnique, je n'ai pas \u00e0 trancher la question de savoir si le Dr Sangha a fait l'objet de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge.\nAA. Quel est le redressement opportun? [209] La Commission demande que l'intim\u00e9 mette fin \u00e0 sa pratique de rejet des candidats appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible au motif qu'ils sont trop qualifi\u00e9s pour occuper un emploi particulier. La Commission et le Dr Sangha demandent \u00e0 ce que celui-ci soit embauch\u00e9 d\u00e8s qu'un poste d'AR sera disponible. Ils demandent \u00e9galement une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire pendant une p\u00e9riode de trois ans, c'est-\u00e0-dire la p\u00e9riode de trois ans comprise entre septembre 2001 et septembre 2004, \u00e0 raison de 55 000 $ par ann\u00e9e, le tout major\u00e9 pour tenir compte des imp\u00f4ts. Quant \u00e0 la perte de salaire, on devrait \u00e9galement tenir compte de toute perte de prestations de retraite et de toute perte d'autres avantages li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'emploi. Tous les revenus que le Dr Sangha a gagn\u00e9s durant cette p\u00e9riode de temps devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9duits du montant adjug\u00e9.\n[210] Le Dr Sangha et la Commission demandent \u00e9galement l'adjudication d'une somme de 10 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral, plus des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur cette somme \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte jusqu'\u00e0 la date de paiement, au taux pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel de la Banque du Canada.\n[211] Enfin, la Commission sollicite une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'Office de prendre des mesures, en consultation avec la Commission, en vue de mettre fin \u00e0 sa pratique discriminatoire ou d'emp\u00eacher que la m\u00eame pratique ou une pratique semblable ne soit \u00e0 nouveau utilis\u00e9e.\nII. L'ORDONNANCE [212] D'apr\u00e8s mon appr\u00e9ciation des faits de l'esp\u00e8ce et d'apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moins de l'Office il est peu probable que l'Office utilise la pratique discriminatoire dans l'avenir. Les t\u00e9moins de l'Office ont r\u00e9pondu sans h\u00e9sitation quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9s par les all\u00e9gations de discrimination, et, selon moi, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s sensibilis\u00e9s aux probl\u00e8mes auxquels sont confront\u00e9s les immigrants appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible qui postulent pour un emploi. Pour ce motif, je n'ordonne pas que l'Office prenne des mesures en consultation avec la Commission en vue de mettre fin \u00e0 la pratique discriminatoire ou d'emp\u00eacher qu'elle soit \u00e0 nouveau utilis\u00e9e.\n[213] J'ordonne que, lorsqu'un immigrant appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible a \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 pour passer une entrevue quant \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 l'Office, l'Office mette fin \u00e0 toute politique ou pratique qui exclurait automatiquement ce candidat au motif qu'il est surqualifi\u00e9 pour l'emploi.\n[214] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l'Office ne devrait pas se fier \u00e0 des rep\u00e8res impressionnistes voulant que les personnes surqualifi\u00e9s ne cadrent pas avec l'emploi parce qu'elles se lassent, ne sont pas motiv\u00e9es, d\u00e9couragent les autres employ\u00e9s ou quittent pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment. Il incombe \u00e0 l'Office d'enqu\u00eater sur les raisons pour lesquelles le candidat postule pour l'emploi afin d'obtenir un pronostic plus juste quant au comportement du candidat s'il est embauch\u00e9.\n[215] En ce qui concerne la question de la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration et de l'indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire, en d\u00e9cidant cette demande, je m'en rapporte \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan, [1992] 2 C.F. 401.\n[216] L'arr\u00eat Morgan traitait de la question de savoir comment on doit \u00e9valuer l'indemnit\u00e9 pour perte d'une occasion d'emploi lorsque le Tribunal a conclu qu'il y a eu discrimination. La partie pertinente de la discussion se trouve dans les motifs du juge Marceau. Dans ses motifs, le juge Marceau affirme que le plaignant n'est pas tenu de prouver que, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire, il aurait certainement obtenu le poste. Aux fins d'\u00e9tablir le pr\u00e9judice, point n'est besoin de d\u00e9montrer la probabilit\u00e9 de celui-ci. La preuve d'une possibilit\u00e9, pourvu qu'elle soit s\u00e9rieuse est le crit\u00e8re quant \u00e0 la perte de l'emploi. \u00c9videmment, dans l'appr\u00e9ciation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, on doit tenir compte du degr\u00e9 d'incertitude quant \u00e0 savoir si le poste aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 (p. 412).\n[217] Pour que l'action en r\u00e9int\u00e9gration et en indemnisation pour perte de salaire du Dr Sangha soit accueillie, il n'appartient pas seulement \u00e0 ce dernier de d\u00e9montrer qu'il y avait possibilit\u00e9 qu'il obtienne l'emploi mais \u00e9galement que cette possibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait s\u00e9rieuse. Selon moi, le Dr Sangha n'a pas satisfait \u00e0 cette exigence.\n[218] C'est ici que les motifs avanc\u00e9s par l'Office, autre que le motif de la surqualification, sont devenus pertinents. La position de l'Office est que les autres candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s pour le poste d'AR \u00e9taient plus qualifi\u00e9s, que leurs qualifications cadraient mieux avec le poste d'AR que celles du Dr Sangha. Je souscris \u00e0 cette opinion. Les qualifications des autres candidats, telles qu'elles figuraient dans leur curriculum vitae, ainsi que les t\u00e9moignages de Mme Anderson et de M. Lennie-Misgeld d\u00e9montrent clairement la validit\u00e9 de cette opinion. Je n'ai pas \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9taill\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[219] Pour ces motifs, je ne peux pas souscrire \u00e0 la demande de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration et d'indemnisation pour perte de salaire faite par le Dr Sangha.\n[220] Quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation pour pr\u00e9judice moral faite par le Dr Sangha, la preuve indique que, lorsqu'il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, le Dr Sangha \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s confiant de se voir offrir le poste. Lorsqu'il a re\u00e7u la r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative, il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que cela l'avait fortement contrari\u00e9. Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 pour passer une entrevue alors que l'Office savait tr\u00e8s bien qu'elles \u00e9taient ses qualifications et, malgr\u00e9 cela, sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, et ce, en grande partie en raison de sa surqualification.\n[221] Le Dr Sangha est devenu tr\u00e8s d\u00e9prim\u00e9 en raison du fait qu'il n'avait pas obtenu l'emploi. Il a consult\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin de famille et celui-ci lui a prescrit des antid\u00e9presseurs qu'il a pris pendant un certain temps. Il a cependant arr\u00eat\u00e9 de les prendre parce que son m\u00e9decin l'avait pr\u00e9venu que ceux-ci pourraient avoir certains effets n\u00e9gatifs. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait pas chercher d'emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9pression et en raison du fait qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9\u00e7u de ne pas avoir obtenu le poste d'AR.\n[222] Dans sa plaidoirie finale, le Dr Sangha a soulign\u00e9 que l'une des raisons pour laquelle il \u00e9tait venu au Canada \u00e9tait qu'il voulait que lui, sa famille et ses enfants m\u00e8nent une meilleure vie. Il a rencontr\u00e9 de nombreux obstacles afin d'obtenir un emploi dans sa profession malgr\u00e9 qu'il d\u00e9tienne des titres de comp\u00e9tence d'une universit\u00e9 d'Europe de l'Ouest. Comme de nombreux nouveaux immigrants professionnels au Canada, il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9 surqualifi\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 des employeurs aupr\u00e8s desquels il a postul\u00e9. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable d'offrir \u00e0 sa famille une qualit\u00e9 de vie proportionnelle \u00e0 ses qualifications.\n[223] En tenant compte de ceci, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'accepter un emploi dans son domaine d'expertise m\u00eame s'il n'aurait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e0 se servir de l'ensemble de ses comp\u00e9tences dans le cadre de cet emploi. L'emploi \u00e9tait relativement bien r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 et il lui procurerait une exp\u00e9rience de travail au Canada.\n[224] En d\u00e9cidant d'un montant pour pr\u00e9judice moral, on doit tenir compte que le montant maximum de 20 000 $ n'est accord\u00e9 que dans les pires cas. Ce n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le pr\u00e9judice moral subi en l'esp\u00e8ce ne d\u00e9coule pas que des actes de l'Office. Il d\u00e9coule \u00e9galement du refus des autres employeurs \u00e9ventuels d'embaucher le Dr Sangha \u00e0 son niveau de comp\u00e9tence ainsi que des barri\u00e8res discriminatoires qui touchent les immigrants appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles.\n[225] Ayant examin\u00e9 l'ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments pertinents en l'esp\u00e8ce, j'adjuge au Dr Sangha la somme de 9 500 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\n[226] J'adjuge \u00e9galement des int\u00e9r\u00eats, lesquels seront calcul\u00e9s en conformit\u00e9 avec le paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats courront \u00e0 compter du 17 septembre 2001 jusqu'\u00e0 la date de paiement du montant de 9 500 $. Le total de ce montant plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats ne doit pas d\u00e9passer 20 000 $.\n[227] Enfin, le Dr Sangha a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le montant de ses frais \u00e0 200 $. L'Office lui remboursera ces frais.\nJ. Grant Sinclair\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 24 f\u00e9vrier 2006\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T949\/6904\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Gian S. Sangha c.
